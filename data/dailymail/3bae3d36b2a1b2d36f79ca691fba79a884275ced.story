Nicky Lovell was today jailed for 10 years after knocking down and killing Ross and Clare Simons

A banned driver who knocked down and killed a 'perfect' couple as they rode on a tandem bike had two children in his car it was revealed today as he was sentenced.

Heroin addict Nicholas Lovell crashed into Ross and Clare Simons as he tried to outrun police - with a 16 month old baby and 12-year-old in his vehicle.

Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission watchdog are investigating as Lovell was driving away from an Avon and Somerset Police patrol car moments before the collision.

He was jailed for ten years and six months at Bristol Crown Court today after pleading guilty to causing the deaths of the couple by dangerous driving in the crash at Hanham, near Bristol, on January 27 this year.

He was also banned from driving for life. He had also admitted driving while disqualified during a previous hearing.

Lovell, who has a 20-year history of crime and motoring offences, admitted causing the deaths of Ross, 34, and Clare, 30, at a previous hearing.

On the day they died the couple - who were about to 
start IVF treatment and would this week have celebrated their second anniversary - were on their way to visit friends in Hanham, Bristol.

At a hearing packed with the couple's family and friends in the public gallery Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Lovell: 'You have a serious drug problem but your deep selfishness and disregard for others is breathtaking.

'In your system you had morphine, methadone and cocaine.

'I am going to pass a sentence on you with the very maximum term the law allows me to because I regard this offence as worst possible example.'

His partner Louise Cox, 35, was jailed for twelve months for trying to cover up the fact he was illegally driving her Citroen Picasso.

The judge told her: 'You were 
perverting the course of public justice in very serious circumstances, 
the death of a young couple before your very eyes.'

Ross and Clare Simons, who died as they cycled on a tandem bike, were described as the 'perfect couple'

In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned.

Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view.

Prosecutor Andrew MacFarlane said 
Cox's 12-year-old son, who was in the front passenger seat, told police 
the speedo reached up to 60 mph before the crash.

Mr MacFarlane said: 'One onlooker 
described the driving as exceptionally erratic, fast and dangerous. Miss
 Belinda Jones saw the car driving dangerously fast.

'No sooner had it passed her sight then she heard a "loud, horrendous bang", then a slightly quieter bang.

Louise Cox has been jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice after providing a false name and description

'She then saw debris appearing flying 
in the air and rolling down the road from the 
direction she had seen the car disappear in.'

Witnesses saw Lovell get out of the steaming wreckage, followed by Cox who was cradling her baby.

Mr MacFarlane added: 'One witness 
said she heard Louise Cox say to Nicholas Lovell, "wait for me, wait for
 a minute", to which Lovell said "no".'

The force of the impact instantly 
killed Ross and Clare, from Staple Hill, Bristol and left their new 
tandem bike in three pieces.

Lovell fled the scene and left lying Cox to tell police a mystery man in a red sweater had been driving, leading detectives on a wild goose chase before Lovell handed himself in the next day when traces of drugs were found in his body.

Despite finally pleading guilty, Lovell has never apologised for causing the couple's death.

He also admitted driving while 
disqualified. Defending Lovell, Simon Morgan said he could offer no 
mitigation other than his guilty plea.

He said: 'He accepts through that plea
 his genuine regret for the anxiety he has caused but accepts the 
expressing of this is simply not good enough.'

Edward Burgess, for Cox, said: 'All I 
can say in relation to her was that she was not the driver and that the 
evidence from her son put forward as a witness is not to the effect that
 she encouraged dangerous driving.'

Fifteen years ago Lovell warned he would either kill or be killed through his reckless driving.

He already had 13 convictions 
for driving whilst disqualified since 1991 and a further four for 
dangerous driving since 1995 before he killed Ross and Clare.

In one incident he tried to escape police by driving through a subway. On another he sped along a pavement forcing people to leap out of his way.

His warning about killing came in
 1998 after a 70mph head-on crash with another car in Bristol when he 
was high on drugs. Lovell only stopped then when his clapped-out Rover 
lost a wheel. In addition, Lovell has been repeatedly jailed for violent
 crimes to fuel his lifelong heroin habit.

In 2003 he was jailed for five years for an armed robbery at a shop.

In 2006 - within weeks of being released - he committed an aggravated burglary and got another 12 months in prison.

In 2009 he was given yet another ban 
for dangerous driving - but each time he has simply ignored the courts 
and carried on as before.

In sharp contrast, Ross and Clare were
 described as ‘a perfect couple' by relatives who held candlelit vigils 
at the scene of their.

'Although he has been given the maximum 
sentence - and we thanks the judge for that - we feel cheated by the 
justice system for the tragic and needless loss of their lives'

- Kelly Woodruff, sister of Ross Simons 

Ross's sister Kelly Woodruff said: 
'They were two amazing people and so, so loved. To have them taken away 
from us is heart-wrenching.

'They were the perfect couple. They loved each other unconditionally, they were made for each other.'

After the sentencing Detective Chief 
Inspector Rachel Williams said: 'Nicholas Lovell is a heartless man who 
has shown no remorse for the deaths of Ross and Clare.

'He needlessly took away the lives of 
this innocent couple who were looking forward to a long and happy future
 together. It took just a few reckless moments to snatch that away.

'Nicholas Lovell and Louise Cox both 
knew he should never have been behind the wheel of the car. I am 
confident Clare and Ross would be here today if he had not driven.

'The sentence passed highlights the 
seriousness of both Lovell and Cox's actions. While it will never bring 
Ross and Clare back I sincerely hope it brings some comfort to their 
families.'

Outside court the victims' families said they felt cheated by the justice system because no-one had stopped Lovell from repeatedly offending over the years.

Relatives of the fun loving couple said 'We are not just mourning the present but the wonderful future they would surely have given us'

Ross's father Edwin Simons said: 'He is going to serve three years for each of our children's lives.

'With his considerable history it needs looking into because this has gone on for years and years.'

Kelly Woodruff, Ross's sister said: 'We are all totally devastated by the loss of Ross and Clare. Their lives were cut short by the result of selfish actions of a banned driver.

'Our case is made worse by the sentence handed out today, it will never be enough and it will never bring them back.

'Although he has been given the maximum sentence - and we thank the judge for that - we feel cheated by the justice system for the tragic and needless loss of their lives.

'The people who took their lives will never understand what they have taken away from us and have never shown remorse.

'We and those close to Ross and Clare have been given life sentences.

'We are not just mourning the present but the wonderful future they would surely have given us.' 

She added: 'We are all truly devastated by the loss of Ross and Clare.

'Their lives were cut short as a result of selfish actions of a driver who was banned from being on the roads.

'If these individuals had thought before getting behind the wheel, Ross and Clare’s deaths would have been avoided and they would still be with us today.

Edwin Simons, Mr Simons’ father, thanked everyone who supported the family.
