Virgil van Dijk has told Celtic he wants to quit Parkhead before the transfer window closes on Monday night.

The £9million-rated Dutch defender has been the subject of interest from clubs including Sunderland, Newcastle, Sevilla and Southampton.

And, despite serving just 12 months of a four-year deal, the 23-year-old wants to leave following Tuesday night’s Champions League exit at the hands of Maribor.

Gutted: Virgil van Dijk has his head in hands after Celtic crashed out of the Champions League - and he could be heading for the exit door 

Down and out: van Dijk wants to leave Celtic after just a year at Parkhead 

The impact of that defeat was clearly illustrated yesterday when Celtic were drawn against Dinamo Zagreb, Salzburg and Romanian minnows Astra in an uninspiring Europa League group.

Celtic have told van Dijk they have no wish to sell but, as they prepare to ship Amido Balde out on loan in the final weekend of the transfer window, the champions are fighting an uphill battle to prevent the Dutchman departing.

‘We need the players we have, so we hope to keep the team as it is now,’ manager Ronny Deila said.

The Norwegian admitted some players could head out, with Balde wanted by former club Vitoria Guimaraes on a 12-month loan.

Targetman: Stefan Scepovic has been brought to bolster Celtic's attack 

And he added: ‘I want to get people out so they can play, not just overflow in the squad but also young players who need to go out and get experience.

‘That’s two different groups. There are a lot of things going on with loans and the squad, getting the squad balanced.’

New striker Stefan Scepovic underwent a medical and chief executive Peter Lawwell also plans to head off new interest from Crystal Palace in Kris Commons by holding contract talks with his agent on Tuesday.

‘Stefan is more of a target player,’ said Deila. ‘He scores and is a box player. He’s very good with both legs and scores in the air, as well, so he can make something from crosses and add power.

‘He is different to what we’ve had before, something we’ve been looking for, so I’m pleased to get the deal done.’

Disgruntled: Boss Ronny Deila has moved to assure Kris Commons of his role at the club 

Dejected: It's been a difficult week for Deila as Celtic crashed out of the Champions League 

Commons could sign a new deal after receiving assurances he is still part of Deila’s plans.

As Sportsmail reported on Thursday, the 31-year-old was unhappy with starting both Maribor games on the bench, but Deila stressed: ‘Kris knows that he has a future here, he knows he’s an important player for the team. He has played nearly every game.

‘Of course I understand he’s disappointed that he didn’t play these games. But that was a tactical decision, not because of a bad performance by Kris. He will have a big influence on the team in the future.

‘I’ve talked to Kris about this. Of course I understand he’s disappointed that he didn’t play. But we’re a team. There are a lot of good players in there.

‘He played against Legia, he played against Reykjavik. He played all the games. We had a plan to do things differently against Maribor and I think we improved.

‘I think the decision was right. I think he was good when he came on the pitch. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it.

‘The team is more important than one player. Everybody knows that. We are a very big club with a lot of good players, a big squad, and we have to use that strength and take it into every match.

‘It’s not about Kris Commons, it’s about the total team. We were thinking we needed more legs in midfield against Maribor, that’s why we did it.’

Asked if he was happy with the fitness of Commons, Deila said: ‘He is a professional, so he works hard. He wants to do it in the proper way – and this is an example for the others.’

Callum McGregor, meantime, has been rewarded for his sterling progress in the first-team with a new five-year deal.

On the dotted line: Callum McGregor has signed a new five-year deal at Parkhead
