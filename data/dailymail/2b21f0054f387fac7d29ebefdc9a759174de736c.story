Princess Diana’s favourite fashion designer Catherine Walker left her entire estate of more than £4million to her husband.

French-born Ms Walker, who died aged 65 in September 2010, produced more than 1,000 outfits for the Princess from her Chelsea headquarters over 16 years.

Diana was even buried in one of her black dresses, which she bought just weeks before she died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.

The Duchess of Cambridge has followed in the footsteps of her  late mother-in-law by wearing Catherine Walker outfits and her mother, Carole, wore one to her daughter’s wedding to Prince  William last year.

Ms Walker designed dresses and ball gowns for many of the world’s most beautiful women.

Known for her discretion, her other high-profile clients included Shakira Caine, Darcey Bussell, Joely Richardson and Queen Noor of Jordan.

Probate records released more than two years after her death reveal that the reclusive and hard- working Ms Walker left a net estate of £4,162,572.

Her will, drawn up in 2003, left everything to her second husband and business partner Sayeed Ismail, 68, a former lecturer at the Chelsea School of Art.

Nothing was left to her two daughters, Naomi and Marianne, from her marriage to her first husband John Walker, a solicitor who died in an accident in 1975 at the age of 32.

But the will stated that her daughters should inherit everything if Sayeed had died before her.

It is believed it was constructed to  maximise the size of her estate as legacies to a spouse are free of inheritance tax.

An inquest heard how she died  in hospital in 2010 from multiple organ failure. She had been living in pain for some time after two  battles with cancer.
