A teenage gun collector was locked up today after he shot his best friend then created an elaborate lie about him being gunned down in the street by a hoodie thug.

Antoine Anicotte, 19, accidentally fired at Nicholas Culpan with a replica 1858 Remington Revolver, a copy of a firearm used during the American Civil War.

French-born Anicotte's mother Catherine gave him the weapon as a gift - which is legal in France - but requires a licence in the UK.

But Anicotte accidentally shot Nicholas during a get-together at his flat in Dover, Kent, in January last year - after they had played video games together.

Canterbury Crown Court, heard Mr Culpan, who was 18 at the time, staggered into the street then collapsed in a pool of blood before he was rushed to the William Harvey Hospital, in Ashford, Kent.

Medics discovered the bullet had 'nicked' the victim's liver and he was transferred to London's King College Hospital for emergency life-saving surgery.

Desperate Anicotte, who collects memorabilia from the American Civil War period, sparked a full scale search for a gunman, after telling police his friend had been gunned down in the street by a man in a white hoodie.

The teen - who had used the gun to fire at seagulls earlier in the day - then named a man who was arrested and spent the night in police cells, before being released.

Sentencing the accidental gunman to four years in a young offender's institute Judge Simon James told him his actions had been 'monumentally and criminally a stupid'.

He said: 'I have grave concerns regarding the risk you pose. You knew that the gun had been loaded because you had loaded a charge into the firing chamber.

'That wasn't simply a reckless act it was monumentally and criminally a stupid one, which could have and almost did have fatal consequences.'Denzil Pugh, prosecuting, told the court Anicotte had been with Mr Culpan and another friend with the weapon at half-cock, loaded with a ball, wadding, black powder and a percussion cap.

He said: 'Anicotte seems to have a morbid fascination with weapons and had quite a collection of weapons at his home.

'He had this weapon which can only be possessed with a certificate for some time.

'It would seem on that afternoon as they played video games they had a little alcohol and a little cannabis.

'This weapon was then brought out and Anicotte began fooling around with it. Quite what happened next was a blur to everyone there.

'With substantial recklessness, Anicotte had put the percussion cap into the weapon - without it, the gun couldn't be fired.

'Maybe the gun was knocked, or an inadvertent jerk, the three heard a very loud report and the gun went off. It hit Mr Culpan in the right-hand side.'

Emily Cook, defending, said Anicotte - who has spent the past year and a half in a mental hospital after suffering a breakdown - now hears the sound of the gun going off every time he tries to go to sleep.

Anicotte broke down and wept as he was sentenced in front of his mother. He admitted charges of unlawful wounding, possessing a firearm and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
