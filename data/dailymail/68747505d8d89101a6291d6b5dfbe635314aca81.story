A man has been shot in the chest by officers after he allegedly threatened police with a baseball bat.

The 45-year-old man is in a critical condition in Liverpool Hospital after the incident in Sydney's south-west.

Police had chased the man from a home in Parkland Avenue, Macquarie Fields, at about 1.20am on Tuesday, to Hispano Place in Ingleburn.

Police reportedly first used a taser on the man before they shot him, after a short five minute pursuit in which he was driving a Holden Commodore.

According to Nine News, two officers were involved in the incident and fired a shot after they were unable to calm the man down.

'Once the vehicle was pulled up, we've been confronted by the male who's immediately gone at them with a baseball bat and things have unfolded from there,' Superintendent Sean Gersbach told media on Tuesday.

 The man was acting aggressively towards police, he said.

 Police were originally called to the house in Macquarie Fields following reports of a domestic violence incident.

Detectives are now at the scene of the shooting and a critical incident team from Bankstown Local Area Command will investigate the shooting.

The investigation will be overseen by the Professional Standards Command.

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
