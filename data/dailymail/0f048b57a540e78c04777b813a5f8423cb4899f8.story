Six lions have been killed and four Maasai herders injured in the latest clash between man and beast in Tanzania.

Authorities said the big cats, which attacked donkeys in a stable, likely came from Tarangire National Park, about 100 kilometres away.

Lion attacks on livestock have become more frequent in Tanzania and neighbouring Kenya, where people and wildlife are increasingly living side by side.

Residents have responded by launching vigilante operations against the cats.

In 2012, people living near the Kenyan capital Nairobi used spears to kill six lions and a cub that attacked goats in a nearby village after wandering out of a national park. 

Lions are part of a rich  wildlife that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists every year and is essential to the local economy.
