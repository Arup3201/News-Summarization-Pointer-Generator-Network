The 16-year-old boy had stolen a car in San Bernardo, south Chile, and a policeman on motorcycle chased him down the road and shot him.

Fatal:  Video shot on a policeman's helmet camera shows the moment an officer shoots a teenage car thief

Police officials have defended the fatal shooting, saying the teenager had already run over and injured one person, and was threatening to cause further injury and therefore needed to be stopped. 

Defending the officer on the motorcycle who fired the killing shots, they added that there was no way of knowing the boy was just 16.

The teenager had earlier stolen the car and was being chased by police officers on motorbikes when he became stuck in a traffic jam.

When the young man saw the armed officers tried to break through the glass of the car, he had smashed the vehicles in front of him out of the way running over another rider and continuing on his wrecking spree.

A police spokesman said: 'As a result of the threat to other drivers, the police officer decided to use his gun to eliminate the threat.'

The video was recorded on the police officer's helmet camera, and shows him asking the driver to stop the vehicle several times.

The police officer is then seen firing his handgun repeatedly at the driver's side of the car before rushing over.

The camera then films  the bloodstained teenager lying slumped forward and not moving.

The 16-year-old was still alive when ambulance arrived, but later died in hospital.

The video was broadcast on a show called 'Criminal Gangs', where it quickly went viral after being shared on social networks.
