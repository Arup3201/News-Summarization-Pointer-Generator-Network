When fully operational, it will be the world's largest offshore wind farm - and, as these pictures show, work on the project in the Thames Estuary is moving along at quite a pace.

The wind farm, which is being built in the shallow waters 12 miles off the coasts of Kent and Essex, which, when complete will feature 217 turbines that will be able to supply enough electricity to power a quarter of London's homes.

The £1.7 billion wind farm, known as the London Array, is owned by the utility companies E.ON, Dong Energy and Masdar and is expected to start sending energy to the National Grid next spring.

The first phase of the project will generate 630 megawatts of power - equivalent to a small gas or coal fired power station and enough to supply 470,000 homes.

Corridors of power: When complete, the London Array wind farm will be the largest in the world

Vast: The £1.7 billion London Array wind farm will feature 217 turbines when complete

The second phase will bring the total to 
217 turbines, each towering 147 metres above the estuary, giving 1000 mw
of power, enough for 750,000 homes.

Work on the project began in January.

It was originally given the go-ahead in May 2009.

At present, the world's largest offshore wind farm is the 102-turbine Walney project, located off the coast of Cumbria.

The Walney project is capable of providing sufficient electricity for about 320,000 homes.

Work in progress: Construction work takes place on one of the wind turbines in the Thames Estuary

Estuarine energy: The turbines, in the Thames Estuary, will eventually be able to generate enough electricity for 750,000 homes
