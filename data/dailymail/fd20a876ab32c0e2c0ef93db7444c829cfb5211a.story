For the past three years, Google has insisted anyone who uses its Google+ social network must register using their real name - a policy that extended to YouTube in 2013.

However, the tech giant has now made a U-turn and will let users post using any username, which ultimately means they can post anonymously.

Although Google claims the move has been made to simplify the process, it could lead to an increase in abusive trolling across its sites.

The announcement was made on an official blog post on Google+.

Over the past year, Google+ has steadily 
started letting +Page owners use any name of their choice, and let 
YouTube users transfer their usernames into Google+.

Although Google will now allow various usernames on the site, it still has a number of restrictions.

For example, all profile names must include a first and last name.

This includes initials.

Users can't impersonate another person, famous or otherwise.

They must also not contain swear words.

It said: ‘When we launched Google+ over three years ago, we had a lot of restrictions on what name you could use on your profile.

‘This helped create a community made up of real people, but it also excluded a number of people who wanted to be part of it without using their real names.

‘We know that our names policy has been unclear, and this has led to some unnecessarily difficult experiences for some of our users.

‘For this we apologise, and we hope that today's change is a step toward making Google+ the welcoming and inclusive place that we want it to be.’

At Google+’s launch in 2011, product manager said: ‘If we find your profile name does not adhere to our policy, we’ll give you a four-day grace period to fix your profile name before we take further action.

'Taking action means your account is closed although you will be allowed to 'take all your content with you, even after your profile is suspended.’

In September last year, YouTube changed its comment policy by switching to Google+ comments, and comment notices to alerts

Users protested about the integration of Google+ with YouTube comments, leading to an online petition with more than 200,000 supporters.

Commenters said they were concerned about their privacy because commenting with a Google+ profile would reveal their identity.
