The wait has ended. It took 21 minutes of this game and 561 in the grander scheme of Premier League football but, finally, Wayne Rooney had a shot on goal.

It trickled to Lukasz Fabianski and it was neither effective nor impressive, but the point is that you can’t score if you don’t shoot and it’s not always easy to shoot if you’re hidden in midfield.

This was Rooney playing up front for the first time in the Premier League since Southampton away on December 8. Roy Hodgson will have been pleased.

Radamel Falcao? Less so. He sat there on the bench, barely speaking but surely thinking.

The experiment with the Colombian has been a curious one. The process of recovery from the sort of knee injury that interrupted his career should not be underestimated. But who could have expected his time at Manchester United to have been so disappointing?

Is there still patience in a striker who was once so brilliantly efficient but now has to prove he is more than damaged goods?

He cannot argue that he has lacked chances. He started the previous three games – two in the League and against Preston in the FA Cup, alongside Rooney, who scored – and did not make a dent.

He was substituted against Preston after an hour. It’s the latest in a line of numbers that simply do not add up for him.

The headline figures are so well-repeated they are almost wired to the sub-conscious - a £6million loan fee, wages of £265,000. 

It is impossible for most to thrive against such vast numbers. But players of his calibre are supposed to. At the very least they do better. But four goals in 19 games – it is not good enough. And that is why he was on the bench.

It will be fascinating to see what happens next. Certainly, it looks hard to see United taking their option to sign the Colombia permanently for £43.2million in the summer.

Monaco claim there is serious alternative interest, with or without United at the bargaining table. 

Their vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said this week: ‘I am not worried for Falcao, he is a world-class striker. If Manchester United decide not to take up the option at the end of the season, we have interest from other great clubs.’

For United, the conundrum still exists, not only of how to find form from this striker, but what to do if they can’t.

This performance was frequently poor. Rooney is good enough to be versatile – a quality that rarely gets the merit it deserves. But he is best as a front man. Did his place up front spark an improvement? No.

The team was poor and Rooney was only a shade above the team’s average. But where Falcao so often darts and disappears, Rooney still carries the aura of a threat. He looks for the ball, he does not hide. When his feet won’t dance, his mind does not give up. That is worth something.

It wasn’t worth much in this game. And United deserved no better. But whatever way Louis van Gaal looks to solve the problems of this side, it appears increasingly unlikely that Falcao will be the answer.
