The parents of the 27-year-old camera assistant who died on set when she was struck by a freight train have claimed that the producers of the film are to blame for her death.

Sarah Jones was killed on February 20 in Wayne County, Georgia and her parents Richard and Elizabeth Jones have hired an Atlanta law firm to ultimately hold someone criminally accountable.

'They did so many wrong things on so many levels, it's just unbelievable,' said Richard Jones. 'This should not have happened. It's senseless.'

It was the first day of shooting 'Midnight Rider,' a movie based on the life of Gregg Allman, starring William Hurt as the Allman Brothers Band singer.

A freight train crossing the Altamaha River on February 20 killed 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones as it plowed into a film crew in rural Wayne County.

Authorities say Hurt, director Randall Miller and the crew were shooting on a railroad trestle when the train came speeding toward them at 58 mph.

The train smashed into a bed the crew had placed on the tracks. Six other crew members were injured, either by the train or by flying shrapnel from the bed.

Elizabeth Jones learned her daughter was dead from a close co-worker and the director called later that day.

'He was very upset,' she said. 'He kept repeating, `I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' But he wouldn't say anything else.'

Sheriff's investigators say the production crew had permission to be on private property surrounding the tracks, but not on the tracks, which are owned by CSX Railroad.

Results of their investigation will soon go to prosecutors, who are weighing possible criminal charges.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are also investigating.

'I think when everything's done and said, it will be clear the railroad never told them they could be on the tracks,' said Joe Gardner, the sheriff's lead investigator on the train collision.

Donnie Dixon, a Savannah attorney hired by Miller, did not immediately return a phone call.

The director and his company, Unclaimed Freight Productions, shelved production a week after the crash. No plans have been announced to resume shooting.

Mother Elizabeth believed Sarah may have believed she had an obligation to rescue the film equipment as the train came down.

'She may well have had that in mind, not realizing the immediate danger,' Elizabeth said. 'Whatever comes from this, it has to be something positive, so that her life will not be wasted in vain. All the energy and devotion and love that she had, it can't be in vain.'

At the time of the accident, the crew was shooting a dream sequence.

But Sarah's family now calls it a nightmare.

'This is not all about Sarah; it addresses a much, much bigger problem,' Elizabeth said.

'The value of a dollar cannot be put on Sarah's life, the way that directors and producers put a dollar value on a movie.

'Everything she did was in a big way and this is a testament to her love of the camera and making a difference after everything is said and done.'

Indeed, just one day before her life was tragically cut short, camera assistant Sarah Jones told her parents she was worried about the shoot and the competence of those in charge.

'She was a little nervous,' father Richard Jones told The Hollywood Reporter. 'She made a comment that some of the people asking her questions should have known more than her.'

In the interview Richard describes the last message he ever received from his 27-year-old daughter.

'She was excited about meeting and working with William Hurt. That's the last text I received from her,' he said.

Jones' parents said their daughter, the middle of three children, was drawn to film-making from an early age.

Young Sarah loved to shoot home movies starring her younger sister and the family dog.

As a college student in South Carolina, she landed an internship on the TV series 'Army Wives,' her parents said, and she loved it so much she offered to stick around for free.

Paid work followed on 'The Vampire Diaries' and other productions after she settled in Atlanta. As a camera assistant, the job required Jones to carry large pieces of equipment that seemed outsized for her slender, 5-foot-6 frame. Co-workers nicknamed her The Ant.

An adventurous traveler, Jones was planning a trip overseas with her mother after shooting ended on 'Midnight Rider' and had begun writing a script for a film project of her own.

Excitement: Sarah was most looking forward to meeting actor William Hurt

Sarah Jones was only 27 when she died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia

Now her parents are collecting donations to fund film-making programs in high schools.

Jones' death, meanwhile, has galvanized behind-the-scenes workers on TV and movie crews to push for improved safety standards on film sets.

Their outpouring of grief led to the Academy Awards briefly showing an onscreen banner with Jones' name and photo during its Oscars broadcast March 3.

'She was planning her future, planning her life ahead of her and all of a sudden it's taken away,' Elizabeth Jones said. 'She had no clue, no idea.'
