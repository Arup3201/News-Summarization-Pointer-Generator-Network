This is the emotional moment a soldier meets his baby son for the first time after springing an elaborate homecoming surprise on his family during a jam-packed ice hockey game.

Sergeant Robert Vandenberg from California, who had been deployed in Afghanistan for ten months, was filmed Wednesday night as he snuck into the arena at the Honda Center in Anaheim.

Footage shows his wife, Patricia, bursting into tears as soon as she spots him, while the proud father can't help but smile as he holds and kisses his new child, Travis, for the first time.

Father's joy: Sergeant Robert Vandenberg met his son Travis for the first time on Wednesday night as he sprung a homecoming surprise on his family during a jam-packed ice hockey game 

Instant connection: The proud dad had only seen his son via the internet and watched his birth on Facetime

The couple's 17-month-son Robert was also present for the heartwarming reunion.

Mrs Vandenberg said she had no idea about the stunt and thought she was going to speak to her husband on the jumbotron instead via Skype.

The Anaheim Ducks ice hockey team often honor those in the military and had set the mother-of-two up in a VIP box.

She believed her husband was in Romania, where he was supposed to be waiting before his return to the U.S.

A video of the event shows that Mrs Vandenberg's video call didn't work out due to technical difficulties but this was something  Mr Vandenberg had secretly planned.

Her expression saddens as the line cuts out and tears well up in her eyes. However, moments later it's a completely different story and she can't stop smiling.

Just as she's handing over the microphone following the failed video meeting, Mr Vandenberg walks down the steps of the arena to surprise his brood.

The whole stadium fills with applause and celebratory cheer as the couple share a long kiss. 

Mrs Vandenberg later took to Facebook to thank everyone involved for the memorable moment.

'Thank you for bringing him home to me in such a special way!

'Thank you to all the Soldiers of the 419th for a job well done. Welcome home and Merry Christmas!' she wrote.

Mr Vandenberg’s battalion was deployed to Afghanistan in February.

His son Travis was born in September and Mr Vandenberg watched his wife give birth in real-time thanks to the power of FaceTime.
