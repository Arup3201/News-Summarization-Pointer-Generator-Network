Andrew Kearns, 38, an oil trader who was sacked because he was said not to be in a fit state after a heavy night out has launched a claim of wrongful dismissal

An oil trader sacked for missing work after heavy drinking sessions yesterday insisted: ‘You can do what you like as long as you make money.’

Andrew Kearns, who earned £140,000 a year plus six-figure bonuses, was fired after being late or absent at least 64 times in two years, the High Court heard.

He is suing his former bosses at commodities firm Glencore for wrongful dismissal, claiming that socialising with clients late into the night was part of his job.

The 38-year-old admitted he enjoyed knocking back up to ‘eight pints of beer then wine on top’, the hearing was told.

The final straw came when he was allegedly so hungover after drinking until 4.30am on a business trip to Singapore that he missed three meetings and did not respond to phone calls from his concerned managers.

Mr Kearns claimed his absences were acceptable given his role in the company and adamantly denied turning up to the office with ‘red eyes and trembling’.

‘The culture in this organisation is that you can do what you like as long as you make money,’ he told the court.

‘I accept that there is sustained lateness and I am saying that it was accepted because I made money.

‘Drinking was an integral part of entertaining and building relationships with people.‘The picture that you want to paint of me is that I’m a wanton alcoholic who doesn’t care about anything other than drink.

‘I’m not an alcoholic, I don’t have binge-drinking tendencies and I am quite lucid in a court of law focussing on the issue at hand.’

Jonathan Cohen, for Glencore, said: 
‘They fired you because you didn’t turn up for work, for meetings...you 
were late, you were drunk.’

Mr
Kearns responded: ‘All acceptable as long as we make money. This was 
not a desk, nine-to-five role. The point is, nobody raised any issue.

‘If you make money you do well – If you don’t, you get fired.’

Counter argument: But Mt Kearns claims he was in fact working hard for the company and that late night socialising with clients were part of the requirements

He also claimed that many of his late arrivals at work were due to train delays.

And he denied claims that he also regularly failed to turn up at his 
former employer, commodity trader Trafigura, because he was drunk.

Mr
Cohen said Mr Kearns had metaphorically ‘slapped Glencore in the face’ 
after bosses arranged for him to see medical specialists because they 
were concerned about his excessive drinking.

Mr
Kearns admitted drinking into the early hours while on the trip to 
Singapore in October 2010, but claimed he had no meetings that day that 
required his attendance.

He said: ‘The reason I was fired was that they needed a scapegoat for the year’s losses.

‘I
had been trying to save the year, because the year had been abysmal. I 
was working extremely hard during this period. It’s a results-driven 
business and I got results so it [lateness] wasn’t an issue.’

His counsel Ahmed Miah earlier told the hearing: ‘We say the dismissal is a mockery and the whole dismissal process was a sham.

‘There was no true or just reason to accuse him of not turning up to meetings when his attendance was not obligatory.’

He told Judge Richard Seymour QC that the married father of three’s reputation was ‘on the line’.Mr
Kearns, from Gillingham, Kent, received a £202,000 signing-on bonus in 
2009. Last week he had his claim for a share bonus of around £750,000 
struck out.

The wrongful dismissal hearing, in London, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
