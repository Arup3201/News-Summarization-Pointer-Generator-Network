Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has rejected rumours linking him with a move away from Anfield by declaring he won't be leaving the Premier League side. 

The Slovakia international has made over 200 league appearances for the Reds since arriving in 2008 but has recently been linked with a summer switch switch to Wolfsburg and Napoli.

However, Skrtel has rejected a potential move elsewhere and has said his future remains at Liverpool despite his contract expiring in 2016.

'I am not leaving anywhere. Not to Wolfsburg nor to Naples,' he told the Liverpool Echo.

Liverpool have endured yet another disappointing campaign this season and are expected to have a clear-out in the summer as they target silverware.

But Skrtel's agent Karol Csonto has confirmed it's unlikely the 30-year-old will leave Anfield as he prepares to finalise a new contract.

'The only offer which is lying on Martin Skrtel’s table right now is the extension of his contract from Liverpool,' he said. 

'We have been working on the details, and we will be finalising it soon.

'It is not true that he has some offer from the German club. I don’t know anything even about their interest.'
