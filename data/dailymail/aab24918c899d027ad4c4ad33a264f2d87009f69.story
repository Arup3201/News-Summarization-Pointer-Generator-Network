Mark Lakinski, a paramedic of 30 years, dropped a sick patient off at an ambulance station instead of at hospital because he was due to finish his shift

An experienced paramedic abandoned a sick patient who later died because he was due to finish his shift.

Mark Lakinski, from Teesside, Middlesbrough, was sent to pick up the male patient eight minutes before his shift ended.

But instead of driving the man all the way to the hospital, Lakinski instead dropped him off at an ambulance station and handed him over to co-workers.

As rescue workers tried to take the man to University of North Tees Hospital he stopped breathing, had a heart attack on arrival and later died.

Lakinski, of Billingham, Teesside had been due to finish his shift at 4pm but received an emergency call at 3.52pm.

The Health Care Professionals Council (HCPC) heard that Lakinski 'admitted the facts, in that he failed to transport a patient directly to hospital, stopping en route at an ambulance station and handing the patient over so he couldbe relieved from duty'.

The panel found that Lakinski's actions amounted to misconduct and he has now voluntarily removed himself from the professional register.

Lakinski had an unblemished career of 30 years before he took the decision to drive the patient to the Stockton Ambulance station instead of to the hospital.

The incident happened on May 18 2009 and at the time Lakinski was suspended from the register for a year.

When the ban was lifted he attempted to rebuild his career in the private sector, but since then fresh allegations against him have emerged.

Lakinski was not present at the latest hearing this week in London, but has been banned from working as a paramedic unless he applies to be restored to the register.
