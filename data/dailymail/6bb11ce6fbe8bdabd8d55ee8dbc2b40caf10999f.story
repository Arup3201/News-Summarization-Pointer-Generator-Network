With more than two months to go until Christmas Day and Halloween and Bonfire Night still weeks away, most people won't have even thought festive decorations.

But for one hotel in North Yorkshire it seems it is never too early to enter into the Christmas spirit.

The St George Hotel in Harrogate has already erected an artificial tree in the bay window at the front of the building - 75 days before Christmas Day.

The appearance of the tree comes despite it being two months until Christmas and Halloween and Bonfire Night still weeks away 

It is also despite the fact it is three weeks until Halloween and a month until Bonfire Night. 

It was spotted by people passing by the three-star hotel in the spa town with one saying he was 'staggered by what he saw'. 

Businessman Richard Chew told the Daily Express: 'It looks completely ridiculous. 

'Whoever decided to put up the tree should hang their head in shame.'  

However, one of the hotel managers told Mailonline that the only reason for the Christmas display was to promote their festive party nights. 

He added that it was placed inside one of the hotel's function rooms and they weren't aware of any negative feedback about the tree.

It comes after a pub in Kent that put up a Christmas tree back in August were forced to take it down after customers complained.

Excited manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up the 12 foot tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford - despite temperatures outside at the time reaching 25C.

But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had took down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.

The manager said it had all been a 'bit of banter' to promote the fact the restaurant had started taking bookings, but that several customers had made negative comments.

The tree baffled diners, who said they were shocked to enter the pub and be greeted by the festive decoration.

A Harvester spokesman said at the time: 'We do have our Christmas menus available now, as some of our guests like to book up early.

'However it looks like our manager has got into the Christmas spirit a little too soon - we normally don’t put our Christmas decorations up until the Autumn.'

Meanwhile High Street retailer Clinton Cards also got their countdown to the festive period under way in August by putting Christmas cards on the shelves.

But the cards were not the only festive-themed wares, with winter wonderland wrapping paper and tree decorations, some featuring Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer also up for sale.
