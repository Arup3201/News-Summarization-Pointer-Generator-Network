Hundreds have been evacuated from their homes as deadly mountain wildfires continue to rage through parched woodland in northern and southern Nevada this morning.

A 24-square-mile blaze has forced more than 500 people out of homes in Mount Charleston some 25 miles 
northwest of Las Vegas while other fires have broken out near Reno and Kearn.

More than 750 firefighters, including 18
elite Hotshot crews, today lost more ground to the raging wildfire fire named Carpenter 1 which was sparked by lightning striking dried woodland on July 1.

Health risk: Smoke from the Carpenter 1 fire in the Spring Mountains range billows behind hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada yesterday

Warning: Officials have issued a health warning as large smoke clouds from the wildfire called Carpenter 1 surrounds Las Vegas

It comes just 24 hours after the funeral of 19 firefighters who lost their lives battling wildfires just 700 miles away near Yarnell, in Arizona on June 30.

Smoke from the blaze near Mount Charleston created a towering white cloud that stretched northeast, visible from downtown Las Vegas.

The Clark County Department of Air 
Quality issued a health advisory that officials said would remain in 
effect today through Sunday.

An influx of firefighters and equipment including bulldozers, seven helicopters, four air tankers and a DC-10 jet fire retardant bomber arrived in the area as other fast-moving fires were reported across the state.

A 27-square-mile fire has burned through the Pine Nut Mountains southwest of Reno while further south salt cedar trees have caught fire along the San Pedro River bed outside the remote community of Kearn.

Pinal County Deputy Chief Steve Henry 
said the new fire had claimed a home and two other structures. It also 
threatened the local airport in the town of some 2,000 residents.

Residents of a trailer park were evacuated as a precaution after the fire was reported early yesterday evening. It was unclear how it started. The Arizona Republic reported the fire had spread across 300 acres by late last night. 

In northern Nevada, the Bison Fire in the Pine Nut Mountains straddling the Douglas and Lyon county lines nearly doubled in size yesterday from a day earlier as it burned through tinder-dry brush, dead trees and pinion-juniper forests. By afternoon the fire was estimated at 17,500 acres, or more than 27 square miles.

The mountain range also stretches into Carson City. Late in the day, fire officials closed popular back-country roads leading from the state capital into the mountains because of the fire's path.

The blaze broke out on July 4 and firefighters initially hoped to have it contained Monday. But those ambitions were dashed Sunday when strong winds fanned the fire into an inferno that pushed to the northeast and created a towering, swirling smoke plume seen for miles.

No homes have been lost, but officials said several old structures burned in the Slater Mine area.

More
than 700 firefighters battled winds, low humidity and steep terrain to 
clear fire breaks through grass, pinion and juniper.

Firefighters
lost ground yesterday on all of the Nevada fires, which each were about
15 per cent contained. Fire managers expecting crews to spend a week on
both fire lines.

No injuries were reported in the southern Nevada fire and no structures burned in the fire since it started on the west side of Mount Charleston near Pahrump and quickly spread east into rugged terrain reachable only on foot. Officials said yesterday that some $2.4 million had already been spent fighting the fire.

Mount Charleston is a popular weekend getaway, where summer temperatures can be 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in Las Vegas, which has sizzled in the triple digits for more than 10 days.

More than 400 homes in Trout, Kyle, Lee, Harris Springs and Lovell canyons were evacuated during the weekend, along with a Clark County-run youth correctional camp that houses 98 teenagers at a mountain elevation of almost 8,500 feet above sea level.

State highways 156 and 157 were closed into the canyons, and evacuation shelters were set up at schools in Las Vegas and Pahrump.

Crews were also working to protect about 100 non-residential structures including barns, sheds and corrals, Nichols said.

Daytime high temperatures on the mountain were expected to decrease over the next few days after peaking at 90 degrees on Saturday, but firefighters were hampered by gusty winds and humidity levels in the single digits.

The fire, named Carpenter 1, was declared a top priority nationwide due to its size and the value of homes and structures at risk, said Suzanne Shelp, a Forest Service spokeswoman.

'This fire, these last few days and going forward, is going to depend on the weather,' Shelp said.
