Three apartments within New York's grand Ritz-Carlton hotel have been listed for sale as one property for the price of $118.5 million, making it the most expensive home in Downtown Manhattan.

The condominium units take up the top two floors of the sprawling building at 10 West Street in Battery Park City, the exclusive community at the southern tip of Manhattan.

The residence measures up at a total of 15,434 square feet and has been listed by Ryan Serhant, one of the three power brokers that star in reality TV real estate series Million Dollar Listing.

It also has nearly 2,200 square feet in terrace space, according to NBC.

Quite a view, eh?: With almost 2,200 square feet in terrace space alone, three units inside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Battery Park City have been listed together for $118.5 million

The combined home, with sprawling views of the Hudson River and Downtown Manhattan, is the most expensive listing in New York

There is no saying whether the sale will go anywhere near $118.5 million. The highest price paid for a property in Manhattan is $88 million

Because the units are inside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel - on floors 39 and 40 - the owner will be afforded the hotels amenities, such as room service

The sale is being handled by Ryan Serhant, one of the three brokers that star on reality TV series Million Dollar Listing

The three apartments are not yet combined but have the potential to be

The asking price beats out a a $110 million penthouse that went on the market in the former Woolworth building.

The three apartments - on levels 39 and 40 and with expansive views of the Hudson River and Statue of Liberty - are only being sold as a whole but are owned by two different people.

The Wall Street Journal reports that one of them, a five-bedroom duplex measuring at about 7,600 square feet and with two terraces, was listed last year for $56.6 million but then taken off the market.

It is said to be owned by Gary Segal of Five Star Electric in Ozone Park.

Mr Segal is owner of another units in the sale, which he only bought in April for $11.7 million.

The third condo is a four-bedroom duplex with five bedrooms, which was listed earlier this year for $23 million.

It is owned by financier Randall Yanker, who bought it for $4.786 million in 2005.

Ryan Serhant, 29, who has listed the three units as one property, is love-to-hate fan favorite broker on Bravo's reality series Million Dollar Listing

The residence measures up at a total of 15,434 square feet

The expansive terrace space and views is part of the listing's premiere drawcards

The master bedroom features stunning views of the Hudson River, Governors Island and the Statue of Liberty

The property has three eat-in kitchens

Serhant, of Nest Seekers International, told The Journal that the listing is justified by the square footage and the amenities.

The lucky buyer will access to hotel's services, such as housekeeping and room service.

As it stands, the most expensive property sale in New York City was $88 million.

That was paid for a penthouse at 15 Central Park West by fertilizer magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2011.

At the time Mr Rybolvelev was the world's 93rd most richest person.

In 2011, fertilizing magnate Dmitri Rybolovlev purchased an $88 million apartment on Central Park West for his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva. It remains the most expensive property sale in Manhattan and boasts  10 rooms, a wrap-around terrace, library and seven walk-in closets
