A cat that was horrifically injured with suspected chemical burns has returned home after it was nursed back to health.

Hades, who lives with his owners in Lingdale, Cleveland, suffered burns to 60 per cent of his body and lost a lot of fur, revealing raw skin underneath.

The injuries were discovered by his owners after he went missing for 48 hours then returned home in a bad condition.

Injuries: Hades suffered burns to 60 per cent of his body and lost a lot of fur, revealing raw skin underneath

PDSA head vet nurse Steph Williams, who treated the animal, said: 'Large patches of his fur had fallen out, revealing red raw skin underneath that looked to be the result of a chemical burn.

'Hades also had visible sores on his nose and mouth, perhaps as a result of trying to clean himself and lick off whatever substance had caused the damage.'

Through pain relief and having his wounds dressed at the PDSA hospital in Middlesbrough, the pet was able to return home in time for Christmas.

Owner Moira Watson-Pickering said: 'I was horrified to see just how bad Hades was, and the thought that somebody may have deliberately done this to him is terrible.

'He looks a little bit like a patchwork quilt at the moment, but he's definitely on the mend.

'We're just so relieved that he survived and I don't know what we would have done without PDSA.'
