A white supremacist has been convicted in a 2004 bombing that injured a black city official in suburban Phoenix, but his identical twin brother was acquitted.

The federal jury Friday stopped short of finding Dennis Mahon guilty of a hate crime among his three other charges.

The 61-year-old twins from Illinois were on trial for six weeks as dramatic testimony came from the bombing victim and a female government informant dubbed a 'trailer park Mata Hari' by defense attorneys.

The jury found Dennis Mahon guilty of three charges in the bombing but found Daniel Mahon, also a white supremacist, not guilty of the one charge he faced: conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosives.

The verdict came nearly eight years to the day since the Feb. 26, 2004, bombing that injured Don Logan, who is black and was Scottsdale's diversity director at the time. Logan was hospitalized for three days and needed four surgeries on his hand and arm. The bombing also injured a secretary.

Logan told The Associated Press that the verdict was bittersweet for him.

'It's not illegal to be a racist but it is illegal to act upon that racism, especially when you injure people,' he said. 'This, to me, is a hallmark case that reached that racial discord, that hate.'

Dennis Mahon was found guilty of conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosives; of malicious damage of a building by means of explosives; and distribution of information related to explosives.

He faces between seven and 100 years in prison at his May 22 sentencing.

Both brothers had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charges.

During the trial, prosecutors argued that the Mahon brothers bombed Logan on behalf of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, which they say encourages members to act as 'lone wolves' and commit violence against non-whites and the government.

Prosecutors played surveillance tapes of the brothers referring to Logan in racial slurs and a voicemail that Dennis Mahon left at the diversity office just months before the bombing in which he angrily said: 'The white Aryan resistance is growing in Scottsdale. There's a few white people who are standing up.'

Defense attorneys said that someone working for the city of Scottsdale was a likelier candidate because Logan's job made him unpopular.

They also heavily criticized the use of 41-year-old Rebecca Williams as an informant, giving her the 'trailer park Mata Hari' nickname — a reference to the Dutch exotic dancer who was convicted of working as a spy for Germany during World War I.

Williams, an attractive ex-stripper herself, was recruited by the feds to implicate the twin brothers.

She moved into the same Oklahoma campground with a government-issued trailer, talked like a separatist and sent them racy photos of herself to win over the men's confidence over a five-year period.

As the trial of Dennis and Daniel Mahon drew to a close, defense attorneys argued that the government's conduct was outrageous and that her actions amounted to sexual entrapment.

But during closing arguments late Tuesday, prosecutor Michael Morrissey told the jury that the hiring of the informant - identified in court records as Rebecca 'Becca' Williams - was 'entirely permissible and necessary' to the investigation of the 61-year-olds.

'There was no use of sex to obtain evidence,' he said.

Among the information Williams gathered from Dennis Mahon was him telling her that the bomb used on Logan was a 1-by-5-inch pipe bomb, a fact that investigators never released publicly and that prosecutors said proved that Mahon was guilty because only the bomber could have known it.

The brothers are accused of sending a package bomb in 2004 that maimed Don Logan, a black man who was the diversity director for the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale at the time.

Logan, 54, was hospitalized for three days after the bombing and needed four operations on his hand and arm.

Morrissey said the Mahons were believers in 'racial terrorism and violence as a way to accomplish their goals.'

Logan testified Friday, choking up as he recalled the chaos after the bomb went off in his hand and describing how he frantically ran down a hallway before kneeling down, hearing a secretary scream and looking down to see blood dripping on the carpet.

'I heard a pop that sounded like a gunshot and everything slowed down,' he said.

Logan said that every time he's been in court he tried to make eye contact with the Mahons, but that they never would look at him. But he noticed that they were watching him with intensity when he re-enacted the bombing during testimony.

'It was almost like they were getting off on me sharing that moment when they sent their prized gift and it detonated,' he said.

Logan worked personally with the Justice Department to have prosecutors seek a hate-crime finding from jurors, which would have required whatever prison term Mahon gets to be longer.

He said that when he speaks to U.S. District Judge David Campbell at the sentencing, he'll ask that Mahon spend the rest of his life behind bars.

'Dennis Mahon is a danger to any community, and to me, he doesn't deserve to be out,' Logan said.

Williams, who is 20 years younger than the Mahons, said agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recruited her after they worked with her brother, himself an informant, to infiltrate the Hells Angels motorcycle gang.

At the time, Williams testified, she was about to be evicted from her trailer and needed the money. She received a total of $45,000, including expenses, and said she was promised $100,000 upon the Mahons' conviction.

On the move: The Mahon brothers were living in Tempe in the months before the 2004 bombing, but relocated to Catoosa, where the Feds sent their informant

Investigators had her pose as a separatist who was fleeing an arrest warrant and was interested in learning about Aryan resistance and how to make a bomb so she could use one on a child molester she knew.

The story was a fabrication designed to get the brothers to open up about the Scottsdale bombing.

Williams also gave the Mahons at least two racy photos — one that showed her in a black leather vest, fishnet stockings, chaps and a Confederate flag bikini bottom, along with a note that read: 'Thought you'd love the butt shot.'

Another photo showed her in a white bikini top, a grenade hanging between her breasts, as she posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika.

Williams testified last month, wearing a gray pantsuit with a dress shirt buttoned up to her neck and black high heels, her long, dark hair pinned up.

Under tense cross-examination, she acknowledged previously being an exotic dancer and became bashful when asked whether she knows how to use her body around men.

During closing arguments, defense attorney Deborah Williams accused the government of acting like a 'pimp' to get the Mahons talking.

'What you have in Dennis Mahon is a loud-mouth — sometimes drunk ... and looking for the attentions of a younger woman who throws herself at him, and she works him like she once worked a pole,' Deborah Williams said. 'And of course he fell for it.'

The defense attorney also referred to footage of the informant covering up a video camera with a towel after a naked Dennis Mahon got into her hotel bed.

Prosecutors said Rebecca Williams gave him a foot rub; the defense attorney said that was ridiculous.

'The whole investigation was scripted around sex, sex and more sex, from the grenade between the breasts to the sleeping with him,' Deborah Williams said.

Judge David Campbell urged jurors to exercise particular caution when considering Williams' testimony, since she was paid for her involvement.

The Mahons, who were living in the Phoenix area at the time of the bombing, but left days afterward and were arrested in 2009 in Davis Junction, Illinois, are charged with various explosives-related offenses, including conspiracy to damage buildings and property.
