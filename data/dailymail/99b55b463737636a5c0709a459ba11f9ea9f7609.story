After a 22-month hiatus disgraced celebrity chief Paula Deen returns to cable television on Wednesday with the launch of a new show on obscure shopping channel Evine Live.

Paula Deen's Kitchen is described as a three-hour live program where she will cook some of her recipes as well as offer exclusive food and pantry items for purchase.

It is the 68-year-old Queen Of Southern Cuisine's first cable TV show since she was infamously dropped by the Food Network in 2013 after admitting in court to using racial slurs.

Evine Live, which changed its named from ShopHQ in November, already offers a range of Paula-branded goods including a set of four chocolate butter sticks for $27.68 and 20 sausages and mustard for $79.07. 

As well as offering fans the opportunity to buy her various products, Deen and family will be answering questions via Google Hangout.

'Everybody makes mistakes,' said Evine CEO Mark Bozek when asked about hiring the controversial figure in a recent Bloomberg TV interview.

He also said that Deen 'has a good soul' and 'a huge fan base.'

 'Y'all are going to love the fabulous and flavorful products we have lined up for you to enjoy!' said Deen about her latest venture.

In 2012 the celebrity chef was sued by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant. 

Among the Paula-branded good that Evine Live is selling is a set of four chocolate butter sticks for $27.68 and 20 sausages and mustard for $79.07

In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident.

'I is what I is, and I'm not changing,' she famously told Today show host Matt Lauer.

'If there is anyone out there that has never said something that they wish they could take back, please pick up that stone and throw it so hard that it kills me.' 

In the aftermath of the scandal Deen was dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years. 

She also lost millions in endorsement contracts and publishing deals when brands including Wal-Mart, Target, Ballantine Books, Caesars Entertainment and Home Depot dropped her.

Last year Deen launched the digital Paula Deen Network, but Evine marks her official return to TV.

Paula Deen's Kitchen will also air additional live segments once every six-to-eight weeks.
