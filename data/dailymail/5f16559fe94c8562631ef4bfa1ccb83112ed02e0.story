They are all a girl wants in her hour of need. 

And now, New York cab drivers are giving their fawning customers the ultimate treat: a pin-up calendar. 

Pot bellies out, chest hair displayed - with that shiny yellow ride in the background - the shots embrace the essence of the city's chauffeurs.

Driver? Or superman? Cab users all over the city could pay just $14.99 to have this hero grace their wall

Charity: The tongue-in-cheek collection will raise money for more than 30,000 hard-up immigrants in the city

The 2015 calendar is in its second year, and features three 'all stars' from the sell-out 2014 edition.

Buyers can also look forward to 10 fresh models to get them through the 12 months. 

All proceeds are given to University Settlement, a charity in the city's Lower East Side which provides more than 30,000 immigrants and workers a year with basic services.

'They're an under-appreciated class of individuals,' said Phil Kirkman, a writer and filmmaker who conceived of and created the calendar along with photographer Shannon McLaughlin, on launching the venture.

Adorable? This taxi driver opts to take his shot with not one, not two, but nine little brown puppies

Need some help with that? This chest-haired driver shows even the kings of the road get flat tires sometimes 

Delightful: The shots embrace the essence of New York, showcasing 'sensuous cookie consumption'

The summer pin-up: One even decided to abandon his ride and leap in a water fountain for the charity shoot

In seeking out taxi-driver models, Kirkman warned them that a sense of humor, not a chiseled torso, was key.

'It just seemed right to put them in front of the camera and let them show the other side of the driver you don't get to see,' he said.

The city's Taxi & Limousine Commission was not involved in making the calendar, but Commissioner David Yassky said he approved of the results.

On the go: Like all New Yorkers, this cab driver has no time to stop and faff with menial tasks like shaving

Coupling up: The calendar proudly featured one cab drivers wife, showcasing the ultimate New York date

'I applaud the photographers who put it together for seeing that New York City taxi drivers are the unsung heroes of the city,' he said.

'They work very hard at a very demanding job, and I think giving them an opportunity to show off a little bit is a good thing.'

The calendar can be purchased for $14.99 here.
