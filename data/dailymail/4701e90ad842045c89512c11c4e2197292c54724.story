A young mother died so soon after being diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer that she never got to say a final goodbye to her children.

Kirsty Allen, 29, who had never smoked, passed away with her mother at her bedside before  doctors were able to start chemotherapy treatment.

The part-time office administrator, who had two children, Ebony, six, and two-year-old Adam, was admitted to hospital with breathing problems but was told the cancer was so advanced it had spread to her spleen, liver and neck glands.

Kirsty Allen died just hours after being diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer, despite never having smoked. She leaves behind her two children, Ebony, 6, and Adam, 2

Ms Allen didn't even have chance to say goodbye to her children, dying just a day after the shocking diagnosis

‘She never smoked in her life, she never touched them,’ said her mother Wendy, 49.

‘She was so healthy and went to the gym and liked keeping fit.

‘They say it was probably because her hormones were at their peak that the cancer happened so quickly.

‘She was a beautiful person both inside and out and she will live on in her children.’

Miss Allen, of Annfield Plain, County Durham, began suffering from headaches and eye problems about six weeks ago.

A routine blood test revealed 
abnormalities in her liver enzymes and bones and she was referred to the
University Hospital of North Durham for further tests.

She was sent to a lung specialist and admitted for treatment when her breathing deteriorated.

Ms Allen had been due to be godmother to her nephew, Austen (pictured). Her funeral will now take place in the same church that his christening was arranged for

Kirsty with daughter Ebony. 'She was a beautiful person both inside and out and she will live on in her children,' said her mother Wendy

The young mother was allowed home over Easter but returned to hospital when she continued to struggle to breathe.

On Wednesday last week she was 
diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and died the following day before 
she could say goodbye to Ebony and Adam.

Her mother added: ‘The doctors said they had never seen anything so aggressive. It happened so suddenly.

‘She was diagnosed on the Wednesday 
and on the Thursday she died. Kirsty lived for her children. She wanted 
to get through the chemo so she could last another ten years. Adam is 
only two and she thought if only she could get him up to 12. But she 
died the next day.

‘I am making a memory box for the 
kids. She said she didn’t want them to forget her. It is so difficult. I
have cried for a week, but Ebony says some sweet things that are 
keeping us strong.’

The youngster said she and her brother had drawn their mother an Easter card which will be ‘sent to heaven with her’.

Ebony said: ‘My mammy is nice, she 
loves me, she loves me around the moon and back and I love her around 
the moon and back too. I will miss her cuddles when she tucks me up in 
bed and when she wraps her arms around me. I will miss her, my mammy is 
really proud of me.’

Miss Allen had been preparing to be named godmother to her five-month-old nephew at a christening service on Sunday next week.

Instead, relatives will now gather for her funeral at the same church in Stanley on Monday.

Her mother added: ‘She was so looking 
forward to being a godmother. Instead we are holding her funeral – 
something I never thought would happen.’

Lung cancer is the UK’s biggest cancer killer, although one in eight who get it will never have touched a cigarette.

Experts say there may be other risk 
factors at play, such as passive smoking, exposure to asbestos, poor 
diet and a family history of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the UK’s biggest cancer killer, accounting for a quarter of all deaths. It kills more people each year than breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and leukaemia combined. 

Contrary to popular belief, it's not just smokers who get it. One in eight in people who get the disease will never have smoked and it can strike at any age. 

People who have never smoked or have been light smokers may have other risk factors, such as  passive smoking, exposure to asbestos and other chemicals, a poor diet and a family history of lung cancer.

If caught in the early stages, the five-year survival rate is 80 per cent. If allowed to spread, that figure drops to seven per cent. Unfortunately, 80 per cent of people are diagnosed in the late stages.
