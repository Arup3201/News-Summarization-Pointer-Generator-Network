Liverpool cruised to a 4-1 win over Swansea to ease the pressure on Brendan Rodgers at Anfield.

Alberto Moreno fired the hosts ahead before a brace from Adam Lallana, either side of Gylfi Sigurdsson's close range strike for Swansea. Former Red Jonjo Shelvey inadvertently completed the scoring by turning into his own net from a Jordan Henderson corner.

LIVERPOOL (3-4-3):

Simon Mignolet - 6.5

Little chance to keep out Gylfi Sigurdsson's strike but parried well from Bony chances and looked solid on return in goal.

Emre Can - 7

Looked untroubled in unfamiliar defensive role, spraying superb attacking passes and playing very comfortably.

Martin Skrtel - 7

Kept Bony quiet and led Liverpool's developing back three well. Looked an attacking threat from set-pieces too.

Mamadou Sakho - 6.5

Still doesn't look good enough for an elite Premier League side and was often poor in trying to clear defensive lines.

Jordan Henderson - 7.5

Captained Liverpool in Gerrard's absence and didn't disappoint. Controlled the midfield and set up opening goal.

Alberto Moreno - 7

Scored first Anfield goal but was just as effective defensively as he was going forward. Looks settled in 3-4-3 formation.

Javi Manquillo - 6.5

Game seemed to pass midfielder by, but was alert defensively to prevent Swansea from gaining an attacking influence on the wing.

Raheem Sterling went close with this effort on Monday but couldn't score in the 4-1 victory at Anfield

Lucas - 7

The enforcer in the Liverpool midfield displayed a mature performance with a 90 per cent completion rate from 59 passes.

Philippe Coutinho - 7.5 (Fabio Borini 90)

Full of invention and was a key attacking influence, with his back heel assist key in build up to Lallana's second goal.

Raheem Sterling - 6.5 (Mario Balotelli 83)

A menace on the run, but night was spiked by poor finishing and a moment of madness to lash out at Fernandez. Lucky not to see red.

Adam Lallana - 8 (Lazar Markovic 77)

Fortunate, yet alert for first goal. But second strike was much more liking of a player costing £25million. Excellent showing.

SUBS

Lazar Markovic - 6.5

Given just 13 minutes and slotted well into a team which already had the game won. More to come though from the forward.

Mario Balotelli (83)

Fabio Borini (90)

SWANSEA (4-2-3-1):

Lukasz Fabianski - 5

Should have done better with opening goal and left embarrassed by Lallana on second strike. A rare poor game.

Federico Fernandez - 5.5

Made seven interceptions, two clearances and battled well with Sterling. But also in a defence that conceded four goals.

Ashley Williams - 5

Bullied by Martin Skrtel when defending corners and couldn't prevent Liverpool's attackers from running riot.

Jazz Richards - 4.5 (Angel Rangel 45)

Had so many problems dealing with Liverpool's attacks, he was hooked off at half-time for Rangel.

Neil Taylor - 5.5

Attempted to add width to Swansea's left wing and often resourceful in possession. Not as convincing in defence however.

Former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey (centre) headed into his own net during a disappointing evening

Jonjo Shelvey - 3.5

Hard to imagine how Anfield return could have got much worse. Should have seen red for elbow on Can and scored own goal.

Gylfi Sigurdsson - 6.5

Couldn't trouble the Liverpool defence with much of his attacking play but was well alert to pounce for Swansea goal.

Wayne Routledge - 5.5

On a night when Swansea needed their speedy wingers to shine, the midfielder was literally caught with his shorts down.

Nathan Dyer - 5.5

Struggled like Dyer to carry Swansea's main creative threat. Had a header comfortably saved but offered little else.

Leon Britton - 5.5 (Ki Sung-yueng 67)

Lost out in the midfield battle. Passing as accurate as ever but couldn't prevent Liverpool from controlling middle of the park.

Wilfried Bony - 6 (Bafetimbi Gomis 62)

Scored the most Premier League goals of 2014 but only had a couple of half-chances at Anfield to add to tally. Replaced by Gomis.

SUBS

Bafetimbi Gomis - 6

Got involved after replacing Bony, but couldn't find the target despite going close on a few occasions - including hitting woodwork.

Ki Sung-yueng - 5

A replacement for Britton but offered no improvement as Liverpool took total control of the game following his introduction.

Angel Rangel - 4.5

Came on to help nullify Liverpool at the break and ended up being in a side which looked like conceding at will in the second half.
