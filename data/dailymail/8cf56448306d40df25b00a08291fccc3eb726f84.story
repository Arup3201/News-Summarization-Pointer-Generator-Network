A unique nude calendar challenges perceptions of beauty with its twelve stunning models - who all have no hair.

The 2015 charity calendar from PrettyBald is themed around a girls' country weekend. Each photo features a country house, fast car, croquet, tea party - or even wellies - and of course beautiful bald models baring all.

The light-hearted pictures also feature wigs in places one wouldn't normally find them.

The 
fundraising calendar wants to show that bald is beautiful to anyone who 
has no hair, whether they have cancer, thinning hair, scarring or 
alopecia.

All of the models have alopecia and the calendar will raise funds for Alopecia UK.

Organiser
 Victoria says: 'Having had Alopecia for nearly three years, I'm pretty 
comfortable in my own skin and am really open about Alopecia, mostly 
because I have a fantastic support network.

'Many
 people I have met really struggle with the condition and it becomes a 
barrier to doing what they want and being who they want to be.

'Education
 is really important, and in a moment of madness one evening I thought: 
"Why not get our kit off and raise awareness of the condition!"

Whether you have cancer, thinning hair, scarring or Alopecia, this calendar aims to showcase and raise awareness of lovely ladies (and gents) without hair

'There
 are many nude calendars out there, but I don't think any can claim to 
be as challenging as this one was - for many of the girls, this was the 
first in public without their hair and they're prepared to share that 
with the world! Amazing!

'I
 am so proud of what has been achieved and hope it can play a small part
 in raising awareness of alopecia, and funds for Alopecia UK.

'Thanks to 
all our sponsors, particularly head sponsor Follea, who have made this 
project possible!'

The calendar costs £10 and is available through PrettyBald's website.

Hair loss is technically known as alopecia.

There are two main types - areata, which is sudden, and androgenetica, which is the normal hair loss that men suffer and is sometimes known as male pattern baldness.

Alopecia areata is divided into three types, depending on how much hair is lost. In its most common form, it results in patchy baldness on the scalp, leaving areas of bare skin which is smooth to the touch.

Where the scalp loses all its hair, it is called alopecia totalis. Sometimes all hair on the body and scalp is suddenly lost, a condition known as alopecia universalis.

Alopecia is not physically dangerous and does not cause any scarring - but it can be devastating psychologically.

Alopecia can affect anyone: it occurs in males and females of all ages and races, although it tends to be more common in childhood through to early adulthood.

Some studies have found that women are more likely to be affected by alopecia than men.
