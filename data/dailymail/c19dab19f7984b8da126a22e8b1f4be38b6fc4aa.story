Snow on sea ice in the western Arctic has thinned by a third and, in some areas, is half as thick as it was 60 years ago, alarming new research has revealed.

This 'significant' rate of snow loss is according to decades of research which found snow has thinned from 14 inches to 9 inches (36cm to 23cm) in the western regions.

It has also thinned by around 13 inches to 6 inches (33 cm to 15 cm) over the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, west and north of Alaska, respectively.

The thinning snow could influence the Arctic ecosystem, with tiny microscopic plants that are key to the Arctic food chain growing beneath the sea ice, the research said.

The data was collected Nasa and the University of Washington using ice buoys, aircraft surveys and historic data from ice floes staffed by Soviet scientists from the late 1950s.

'The snow cover is like a shield that can insulate sea ice,' said Dr Son Nghiem of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

'In this study, we had thousands of measurements of snow depth on sea ice to thoroughly validate Nasa's aircraft observations.

This graph shows the change in springtime Arctic snow depth compared to the average (shown in red). The data come from Soviet drifting ice stations (1950-1987),  Ice Mass Balance buoys (1993-2013), and the Nasa IceBridge airborne project (2009-2013)

'We knew Arctic sea ice was decreasing, but the snow cover has become so thin that its shield has become a veil.'

Scientists believe the reason for the thinning snow may be that the surface freeze-up is happening later in the fall so the year's heaviest snowfalls, in September and October.

What thinner snow will mean for the ice is not certain. Deeper snow actually shields ice from cold air, so a thinner blanket may allow the ice to grow thicker during the winter.

On the other hand, thinner snow cover may allow the ice to melt earlier in the springtime.

Thinner snow could also impact animals that use the snow to make dens, and for low-light microscopic plants that grow underneath the sea ice.

The new results support a 15-year-old UW-led study in which Russian and American scientists first analysed the historic Arctic Ocean snow measurements.

That paper detected a slight decline in spring snow depth that the authors believed, even then, was due to a shorter ice-covered season.

'The delay in sea ice freeze-up could be changing the way that heat is transported in the Arctic, which would, in turn, affect precipitation patterns,' said first author Melinda Webster, an oceanography graduate student at the University of Washington.

'That's going to be a very interesting question in the future.'

Research suggests that some Arctic lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere.

This counters a widely-held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming.

The study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish, leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption.

Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the study was published earlier this month in the journal Nature and focused on thermokarst lakes.

These occur when permafrost thaws and create surface depressions that fill with melted fresh water, converting what was previously frozen land into lakes.

The research suggests that Arctic thermokarst lakes are 'net climate coolers' when observed over longer time scales, namely several thousand years, although they initially warm the climate.

The researchers observed that roughly 5,000 years ago, thermokarst lakes in ice-rich regions of North Siberia and Alaska began cooling, instead of warming the atmosphere.

'Until now, we've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming,' said lead researcher Dr Katey Walter Anthony, associate research professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Northern Engineering.
