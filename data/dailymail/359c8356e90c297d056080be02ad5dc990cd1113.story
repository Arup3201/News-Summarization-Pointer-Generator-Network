A Miami woman called Isis Martinez posted a video on YouTube in which she pleads with the media to please stop using her name to refer to the 'shameless excuses for human beings' who have misappropriated her appellation.

The 38-year-old, who heads a non-profit in the Florida city, has created a petition urging the media and others to use the acronym 'ISIL' instead of 'ISIS' to describe the group formerly known as Islamic State of Iraq the Levant.

The petition, part of a campaign that began on August 23, has so far received 352 signatures.

Isis Martinez said she's tired of the 'awkward looks' and negative reactions of people when she introduces herself

'I couldn't just sit back and let it happen,' she said in an interview with Newsweek. 

She points out in the video that the United States government uses ISIL - including President Barack Obama - to refer to the group that now calls itself simply  the Islamic State, as do the UN and the Associated Press.

'The past several weeks have been overwhelming' as she's seen her name over and over again in print, Martinez said on the video. 'People's reactions aren't improving at all and i'm getting all sorts of looks.' 

Since starting her campaign, which now involves running a Facebook group and posting messages to Twitter, Martinez says many other women named Isis have come forward to share their own anecdotes, Newsweek reported. 

Some women said others ask if Isis is their real name, while others said their children with the appellation are bullied in school.

'People just cringe,' Martinez says, describing the reaction when she introduces herself.

Why not just use her middle name, Theresa, instead? 

'If I go by a nickname or a middle name, the terrorists win,' she says flatly. 

Martinez said that she was named after her mother, whose parents got Isis from the Egyptian goddess of health, marriage and love.

'I will not and cannot change my name and neither should the thousands of others who share this beautiful name,' she said.
