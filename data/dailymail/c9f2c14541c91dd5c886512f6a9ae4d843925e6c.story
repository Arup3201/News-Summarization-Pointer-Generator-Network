Author Hilary Mantel is to make the late Margaret Thatcher the subject of her next book

Hilary Mantel, the only female writer to twice win the Man Booker Prize, will make Margaret Thatcher the subject of her next book.

The Wolf Hall author will pen a collection of short stories about the former prime minister, who died in April last year.

The novel, entitled The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher, will be published in September.

Publishers have revealed it will be made up of 10 stories featuring the late Baroness Thatcher as the protagonist. 

But unlike Mantel’s most recent works of historical fiction the plot of each story will be set within ‘contemporary settings’.

Nicholas Pearson, publishing director at 4th Estate, said: ‘A new book from Hilary Mantel is a treat. ‘Where her last two novels explore how modern England was forged, The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher shows us the country we have become.

'These stories are Mantel at her observant best.’

Mantel made her name with her novel Wolf Hall which follows the 16th century court intrigues of Thomas Cromwell, adviser to King Henry VIII.

The book won Mantel the Booker prize for the first time in 2009 and three years later she was awarded the gong a second time for its sequel Bringing Up The Bodies.

Both works topped the best seller list in the UK, with Bringing Up The Bodies making her the first ever author to enter the charts at number one.

The 61-year-old author was also awarded the Walter Scott Prize in 2010 and won the Costa Book Awards in 2012.

The Derbyshire-born author caused controversy last year after she attacked the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ with no personality, whose only purpose is to breed. 

During a lecture at the British Museum, she criticised Kate as appearing to have been ‘gloss-varnished’ with a perfect plastic smile in contrast to the late Princess of Wales, who she described as awkward and emotionally incontinent.

She went on to suggest that the ‘painfully thin’ Kate was selected for her role of princess because she posed no risk of showing any character.
