A Booker prize winning author has scooped his latest literary honour when he received the 2014 Bad Sex in Fiction prize.

Ben Okri, beat the challenge of Wilbur Smith and BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark due to a single passage in his novel, The Age of Magic. 

The judges were impressed by the encounter between his character Lao and his girlfriend Mistletoe. 

Booker prize winning author Ben Okri, pictured, last night won a slightly less prestigious literary award when he beat off the challenge of the BBC's Kirsty Wark and Wilbur Smith to win the 2014 Bad Sex in Fiction prize

The passage read: 'When his hand brushed her nipple it tripped a switch and she came alight.' 

Later in the scene, Okri describes the characters as being 'adrift on warm currents, no longer of this world,' before ending the unfortunate passage with 'somewhere in the night a stray rocket went off'. 

In 1991 Okri won a more welcome literary prize when he was awarded the Booker prize for his novel The Famished Road.

Commenting on his latest award, Okri said: 'A writer writes what they write and that's all there is to it.' 

His editor Maggie McKernan said: 'Winning the award is fun but a bit undignified, just like sex, assuming you do it properly.'

The prize, organised by The Literary Review magazine, was handed over to Laura Palmer, the editorial director of his publishers Head Of Zeus, at a ceremony in central London.

It was established in 1993 by critic Auberon Waugh to 'draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them'.

Previous winners include Norman Mailer, Giles Coren and Melvyn Bragg.
