Failing to pay your TV licence will remain a criminal offence after peers voted down Government plans to water down the draconian punishment.

Peers voted by 178 to 175 to keep the non-payment of the licence fee a criminal offence, amid fears that thousands of families may refuse to pay if the system was overhauled.

Tory peer Lord Grade, a former chairman of the BBC, warned that 'dark forces' were at work – and said he was 'deeply concerned' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the BBC's budget.

Tory peer Lord Grade, a former chairman of the BBC,  said he was 'deeply concerned' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the BBC's budget

He warned: 'I would love to see the licence fee decriminalised, but there are risks in doing that.

'There are risks the enemies of the BBC will see it as an opportunity to then move the compulsory element of the licence fee and move the BBC to a subscription model which would completely undermine the whole concept of public service broadcasting. I think there are dark forces at work.'

Lord Grade said that if the licence fee was to be decriminalised, it needed to happen as part of longer-term funding plans for the corporation.

'We need to reflect on that in the context of Charter review not in a hurried order from Government just months away from Charter review,' he said.

'I see no reason at all to interfere with the BBC's financial planning and I see every reason to support this amendment in order to take a measured look and so that we don't interfere with the delicate financial arrangements for the BBC.'

Lady Benjamin said there was a 'potential impact on children's programming' as, if licence fee evasion increased to around 10%, it could result in a reduction in the BBC's revenue of £200 million.

'This could mean that children's original UK content could suffer,' she said.

Lord Fowler told peers: 'We know nothing about the future of the BBC, we know nothing about the future of the licence fee and we know nothing about the impact it will have on the finances of the BBC.

'This is all basic information that Parliament is entitled to have before making a change of this type.

'What we do know is that some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this change are opposed to the licence fee to any event.

'This is just a mini sideshow as far as they are concerned. They are opposed to the BBC as a public broadcaster and they advocate a subscription system.

'We know that that is the case.'

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid today said he would keep 'all options open' about the future of the TV licence

Lord Cashman said: 'I see it, quite frankly, as an attempt to constrain the BBC - it is a seat belt wrapped over the BBC. It will stop them being able to do any long-term planning.

'This great public service broadcaster will be inhibited from going into contracts of employment with their own staff, let alone staff that they need to bring if their long-term planning is to produce the programming that we demand.'

Baroness Howe of Idlicote, an independent crossbench peer who put forward the amendment, said: 'Under the current settlement the BBC has been able to plan its programme-making years in advance and budget accordingly.

'Any changes to the licence fee enforcement regime coming into effect before April 1 2017 would have a significant impact on the content the BBC provides.'

David Cameron has backed proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence

But Labour peer Baroness Corston, who wrote a landmark report on women in prisons, opposed the amendment and called for an early end to the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee.

She pointed to the effect on women who were sent to prison and lost their children because they were unable to afford to pay the licence fee.

'I know that 50 people a year are imprisoned because they don't pay a television licence,' she said.

'They are not imprisoned if they don't pay council tax and local authorities seem to survive.'

She added: 'We should not allow the continuing criminalisation of this penalty because of the malign effect it has on an admittedly small number of people.

'I do not think that the signal we are sending that the status quo is alright is acceptable.'

Viscount Colville of Culross, a BBC producer and an independent crossbench peer, said that going ahead with decriminalisation would 'blow a huge hole' in the corporation's budget.

Labour peer Lord Rooker, who chaired the committee that scrutinised the Bill before it was considered by Parliament, warned: 'The risk to the BBC of what might happen is so substantial because of the forces charged up against the BBC under other guises.'

For the Opposition, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara said that when the licence fee settlement was announced in 2010 the then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt said there would be 'no new financial requirements or fresh obligations of any kind' placed on the BBC before 2017.

He said: 'I call on the Government to honour that commitment, which it can do in part by accepting this amendment.'

A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said David Cameron believed decriminalisation was an idea that 'warrants proper consideration, that's why we have put David Perry in place to conduct an independent review of that'.

She added: 'That's due to report back this June and the PM's view is that we should have the flexibility to act on the recommendations in that review.'

The amendment passed in the Lords 'does not give the flexibility to act sooner (than the licence fee settlement) and that is exactly the point I think during the parliamentary process we will continue to make and seek to preserve'.
