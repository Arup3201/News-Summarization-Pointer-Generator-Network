When your star player kung-fu kicks a fan, you expect that to be the end of their time at your club - yet when Eric Cantona assaulted a supporter it actually extended his stay at Old Trafford!

The former Manchester United forward was set to join Inter Milan in 1995 but his indiscretion and subsequent ban ensured the Italian side pulled out of the deal.

In an interview with Italian paper Corriere della Sera, ex-Inter president Massimo Moratti revealed that he had teed up a double swoop for Cantona and then-Sampdoria forward Roberto Mancini towards the backend of 1994.

However, Cantona's kung-fu kick and barrage of punches towards a Crystal Palace supporter at Selhurst Park after he was sent off ensured the deal could not go ahead.

The ex-France international was fined £20,000 and banned for four months by United, but the FA then increased the suspension to eight months and he was forced to pay another £10,000 as well.

He was also originally sentenced to a 14-day prison sentence after being convicted of assault but that was quashed on appeal.

The length of the ban ensured Inter could not pursue the deal for Cantona - and Sampdoria changed their mind about selling Mancini, meaning neither player moved to the San Siro.

In Corriere, Moratti is quoted as saying: 'Then Cantona did it.

'In London, with me present, this kung-fu kick of the Crystal Palace fan.

'And then he wanted to stay in Manchester, while Sampdoria then decided that they would not let Mancini leave.'

Cantona subsequently remained at United until he retired in 1997.

He scored in 80 goals in 185 games for the club after signing from Leeds United in 1992.
