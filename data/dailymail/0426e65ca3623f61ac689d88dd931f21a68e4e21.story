As Britain’s golden girl at the 2012 Olympics, she had the most famous six-pack in the world.

But it’s goodbye to the rippling stomach for now as Jessica Ennis-Hill yesterday showed off her baby bump for the first time.

The heptathlete was in Glasgow yesterday to unveil a new athletics stadium ahead of the Commonwealth Games later this year.

In a smart black cardigan and white T-shirt, the Olympic gold medallist who won’t be competing in the games looked radiant as she showed off her bump.

She said she was ‘very excited’ for her baby’s birth and was looking forward to a ‘very different year’.

But despite her excitement about her baby, the Olympic Star told how she was looking forward to returning to athletics for the next Olympics in Rio in 2016.

As one of Glasgow 2014’s most high-profile ambassadors, she said: ‘It definitely makes me feel like I want to compete but obviously I’ve got a very different year ahead of me and I’m very excited for the arrival of our little one.’

Ennis-Hill revealed her baby news eight months after she married her childhood sweetheart, builder Andy Hill, in the Peak District, near to their Sheffield home. The London 2012 heptathlon champion said at the time that the news meant she would miss the Glasgow Commonwealth Games.

Even though she is pregnant, she has been keeping fit and healthy with a mix of yoga and specialised workouts.

She recently uploaded a video on Facebook showing part of her training session on the indoor bike, wattbike.

She became the darling of London’s 2012 Olympic Games when she stormed to victory in the Heptathlon with her personal best and a new national record.

The athlete, who hopes to return in time for Rio 2016, also talked about how athletics was dominated by men and suffered from a lack of female coaches...

She said: “Nobody ever comes to me and says ‘Will you help me with my game?’ any more,” she said. “It’s a big mistake because we are a great resource, and they should ask.”

“It [athletics] is very male dominated and I agree it would be great to see more female coaches involved in track and field because I do feel they could bring a lot to the sport.

“But it’s something we hope will change.”
