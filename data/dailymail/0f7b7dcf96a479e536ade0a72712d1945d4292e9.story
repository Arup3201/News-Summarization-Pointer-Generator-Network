A police officer who became an internet hit when he smashed a  pensioner’s car window with his baton has been awarded £440,000 in compensation after claiming he was ridiculed out of his job.

PC Mike Baillon, 47, walked out saying that he had become a laughing stock among colleagues.

Footage of him hitting the disabled man’s vehicle 15 times was leaked on YouTube, where it became a global sensation.

Former PC Mike Baillon was awarded  £430,000 at a Cardiff hearing yesterday. He says he had to leave Gwent Police over ridicule from this video of him attacking a Range Rover

PC Mike Baillon, pictured left, complained he had become a 'laughing stock' over a YouTube video of him using a truncheon to smash into a pensioner's car.

The
 taxpayer-funded cash for constructive dismissal is the equivalent of 12
 years’ salary for a PC on the highest pay grade and does not include 
legal costs. Critics will say it highlights an out-of-control 
compensation culture in policing.

In
 comparison, the 74-year-old man whose Range Rover was wrecked was given
 just £20,000. Robert Whatley said last night: ‘It’s totally 
unreasonable behaviour rewarded by a totally unreasonable pay-out.

‘PC Baillon’s behaviour was terrible to start with – but it is even worse that he has been given so much money.’

PC
 Baillon was one of two officers who  pursued retired businessman Mr 
Whatley along country roads near Usk, South Wales, in 2009. The stroke 
victim was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt and drove away before 
officers finished speaking to him. They chased him for 17 minutes, then 
pulled over his £60,000 black car again.

Mr
 Whatley said he expected a knock on his window but instead PC Baillon 
attacked it with a metal baton while his colleague jumped on the bonnet 
and kicked through the windscreen. The police car’s dashboard camera 
showed PC Baillon running up to the driver’s door and smashing the 
window.

The officers were 
cleared of misconduct after an internal inquiry, but PC Baillon was 
removed from frontline duties because his mental state could have 
affected him in high-speed chases, a tribunal heard.

The Cardiff employment tribunal was told colleagues often brought up what became known as the ‘Whatley incident’.

Once, after police had to smash a suspect’s door down, a colleague told him: ‘It wasn’t a window.’

Mr
 Baillon told the tribunal his locker was defaced and he became a 
‘laughing stock’ before taking sick leave and complaining to Gwent 
Police Authority.

The former
 traffic officer said: ‘Ridicule from colleagues was getting to me – it 
was every single day. They thought I had done wrong and I was lucky to 
have got away with it. I just wanted my closure.’

The
 tribunal heard he could have won £750,000 from his seven claims, 
including personal injury, injury to feelings and aggravating damages, 
but only one was upheld.

Mr 
Baillon, who has since set up a business selling wooden reindeer, was 
awarded almost £440,000 for loss of pension and earnings. The tax-free 
payment is the equivalent of 12 years’ salary for a PC on the highest 
basic pay of £36,519.

His 
solicitor criticised the Gwent force for ‘removing him from the job he 
loved’ in a ‘gross abuse of power’. Nick Smith said he ‘hung on for grim
 death’ but finally ‘snapped’ and quit.

Incident: Driver Robert Whatley claimed Mr Baillon and his colleague - who jumped on the bonnet and smashed the windscreen - went over the top

Held: Robert Clive Whatley was questioned by police after being taken out of the car during the two-minute stop recorded by the officers' car's on-board camera.

Damage: Mr Whatley was ordered to pay £235 after being found guilty of speeding and failing to stop for police - but received compensation for the damage to his Range Rover inflicted by Mr Baillon and his unnamed colleague

He
 added: ‘We’re talking about  a man who would have made  sergeant. This 
was a man who had been wounded to his core by how he had been treated by
 his employers. What has made that worse is the disingenuous way the 
force has defended their actions.’

Mr
 Baillon, who served with Gwent for 16 years, said: ‘I would rather be 
driving police cars but I couldn’t accept the treatment.’

Mr
 Whatley was awarded £20,000 for the damage to his Range Rover, and 
ordered to pay £235 for speeding and failing to stop for police.

The
 payment is the latest huge police compensation claim. One Suffolk 
officer received more than £13,000 after hurting his big toe during 
safety training.

Norfolk PC 
Kelly Jones threatened to sue a garage owner after tripping over a kerb,
 but dropped her claim after a national outcry.

Home
 Secretary Theresa May has criticised ‘frivolous’ claims which she has 
said do not show ‘the sort of attitude’ officers should have.

But Tory MP David Davies, whose Monmouth constituency covers the scene of the incident, said that senior officers were to blame.

He
 said: ‘I don’t like to see big pay-outs of this kind, I think the whole
 thing should have been dealt with better by the police force.

‘There’s
 no doubt in my mind PC Baillon was unfairly treated and he should have 
been exonerated quicker. He was a good police officer and it was a shame
 he had to leave his job.

‘He was chasing after a vehicle which had refused to stop and he had every reason to think this  was suspicious.’

Gwent Police said in a statement that it was disappointed with the outcome of the case.

Conservative MP David Davies criticised the size of the compensation payout received by Mr Baillon, but said it was the fault of the force, not the former officer.

The Tory politician said police chiefs were to blame for not dealing with his case quicker to stop the workplace taunts by other officers.

Mr Davies, whose rural Monmouth constituency covers the scene, has been in touch with Mr Baillon since the truncheon attack on the Range Rover.

He said: 'I don't like to see big payouts of this kind, I think the whole thing should have been dealt with better by the police force.

'It should have been dealt with more quickly - it was very clear he was under great stress but his case took ages to be looked at.

'There's no doubt in my mind Pc Mike Baillon was unfairly treated and he should have been exonerated quicker.

'He was a good police officer and it was a shame he had to leave his job.

'There is a tendency in the police to rib people, but his colleagues were making a mistake when they made fun of him.

'He was chasing after a vehicle which had refused to stop and he had every reason to think this was suspicious.'
