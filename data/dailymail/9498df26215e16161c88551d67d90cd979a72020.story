A turf war has broken out between MPs and peers as they battle to carve up the House of Commons car park – and political bruiser John Prescott is right at the heart of the row.

Spread over five floors beneath the Palace of Westminster, the 495 car spaces are for the use of MPs and their staff, who jealously guard the perk.

Peers have to park outside in the grounds of Parliament.

Lord Prescott, who was known as Two Jags, still uses the car park despite becoming a peer three years ago

Now their lordships are claiming rights to two of the underground storeys and submitted their demand to the Administration Committee on Monday.

But as MPs were debating the proposal, Tory MP Conor Burns pointed out that Lord Prescott still parks his blue-grey Jaguar in the car park, even though he became a peer three years ago.

However, a spokesman for Lord Prescott – who was known as Two Jags – said he was given a pass to use the car park a year ago due to a surplus of spaces.

Reacting to the demand, one furious MP, who described the move as ‘a land-grab like you see in Gaza’, said: ‘They just want to park their Bentleys in an underground car park.

‘They also don’t want their staff to use public transport.’

The peers claim the car park has a surplus of spaces as MPs apparently now prefer to come by public transport.
