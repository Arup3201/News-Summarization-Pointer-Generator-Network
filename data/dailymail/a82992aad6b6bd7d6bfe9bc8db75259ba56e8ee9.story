On the Sunday after Paul Merton’s second wife Sarah died of cancer, he went to the Comedy Store in Leicester Square, where he had performed many times.

He kept in the background and absorbed the atmosphere. He really wanted to be performing, but worried that doing so so soon after Sarah’s death might not be seemly.

It is a curious, even risky admission by a comedian held in considerable affection by millions that his instincts after his wife’s death were to make people laugh — and that they had to be held in check because of ‘decorum’.

Only someone like Merton, 57, the son of a Tube driver and a nurse, could get away with it. He grew up in Fulham, south west London, wanting to be a comedian and, as he says in his autobiography published this week: ‘Humour is essential to people’s lives.’

Sarah Parkinson, a producer, writer and actress, was the second of Paul’s three wives. When she died, they’d been together for three years, since the collapse of his six-year marriage to the actress Caroline Quentin.

He and Sarah were married for a mere 12 weeks. The wedding was a beautiful affair in Rye, East Sussex, where they kept a country house.

The weakened Sarah left the church grounds on a white horse. She’d been diagnosed with breast cancer 19 months earlier, when she was 39, in the spring of 2002, after finding two lumps in her breast. Everyone at the wedding knew she didn’t have many months to live.

As Paul records with brutal irony, just three hours after a doctor told them the cancer was fast-growing and had spread beyond the lymph glands, he was recording an episode of Room 101 — a fictional place where things are eradicated forever — with fellow comedian Ricky Gervais.

The brave Sarah had decided after an operation not to have chemo or radiotherapy. She spent her final week in a hospice.

So the age-old coalescence of tragedy and comedy had struck yet another comic. But Merton, who married again in 2009 to comedy actress and writer Suki Webster, manages to wear trauma lightly. Perhaps this is his way of coping.

Twenty-four years ago he suffered a mental breakdown, just as his career was beginning to take off, and ended up in Maudsley psychiatric hospital in Camberwell, South London, for two months. Yet in his autobiography he doesn’t say it happened due to stress, insisting instead that it was down to mistakenly overdosing on anti-malaria tablets following a trip to Africa.

His breakdown emerged unexpectedly one evening, when he suddenly started crying while talking to a friend. He explained he was doing so because he thought he was Jesus.

After that he began hallucinating — imagining that people were staring at him, and seeing 15-inch transparent worms.

He ended up being taken by taxi to the hospital, where at least two other people were claiming to be Jesus, and he was recognised in the canteen because he was simultaneously appearing on TV in the prerecorded comedy show Whose Line is it Anyway?

Three months after leaving the Maudsley, he got a phone call from Hat Trick, the prolific TV production company. Was he interested in making a pilot for a quiz show based on the week’s news?

‘That’s not for me,’ he told them. ‘I don’t do topical jokes. In fact I know nothing about current affairs.’ Back came the reply: ‘It doesn’t matter. Just be funny. You can do that.’

The show was the enduring hit Have I got News for You, and Merton was to be one of the team captains. He says the opposing captain, Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, was also wary of being in the show, as it might affect his dignity — he was, after all, ‘a serious journalist’.

Angus Deayton was the excellent presenter. But in 2002, 12 years after the show started, the News of the World exposed him with a lurid story about him snorting cocaine with a prostitute. At the next recording of Have I Got News For You — as the cameras rolled with Deayton in his usual place, seated between the teams as quiz host — Merton leapt up and unzipped his fleece jacket to reveal the vivid News of the World front page printed on his T-shirt.

Merton says it had to be done — and it was his idea. Angus’s predicament had to be treated with the same jovial hostility they would treat any other story, because the show was based on the week’s news.

Not to have done so, Merton believes, would have prompted accusations that they could give it but not take it.

He knew it had been uncomfortable for Deayton, even though he, too, realised the best way of handling the situation was to make fun of it. Merton says Angus told him: ‘Thank you for making it funny.’

That might have saved his job — not to mention the show’s underlying integrity — for the time being, but when the next series opened there were even more accusations about Deayton’s private life.

They’d managed the first situation, but there would be no laughing away his discomfort the second time around. So he was out and — although Merton doesn’t say so in his memoir — is said to blame Paul and Ian for forcing the issue.

Despite his absence, Have I Got News For You continued from strength to strength, using guest hosts. Merton mentions that former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has been the worst. He was so slow reading the autocue that the episode took more than two hours to record — the longest time ever.

Merton admits that, like Deayton, he’s had drug experiences — although never as a consumer.

He tells an extraordinary story of spending an evening rolling joints for Peter Cook and other guests at Cook’s flat in Hampstead, north London. He’d been invited with fellow comic and friend Julian Clary and half-a-dozen others.

‘Peter was one of my great comic heroes when I was growing up,’ writes Paul. ‘His wit, elegance and charm inspired me.’

In the kitchen, Paul, a former council-house boy who says his interminable wise-cracking as a youngster lost him any number of friends, found another idol from his childhood — Monty Python’s Eric Idle. Although there was plenty of alcohol, Merton says he didn’t drink much as he was anxious not to act star-struck.

There was also cannabis for anyone who wanted some.

Here, surely, was a situation that most people who refuse to have anything to do with drugs would find extremely embarrassing. Merton, however, handled it with enviable aplomb.

Cook and Idle were sitting next to each other, and Merton offered to sit near them, rolling their joints for them. Cook replied: ‘What a sensible arrangement. What I like about cannabis is it does what it says it’s going to do.’

Just why Merton didn’t think his toe-curling offer would make him look like the ultimate ‘fanboy’ — especially as he didn’t know how to stick the papers together — he doesn’t say.

But he spent a happy evening listening to the talk of his comic heroes and, every so often, rolling a joint that was passed around the room. What fun Have I Got News For You could have with his pot-sodden evening.

The one drugs scare that did panic him into rushing out early to buy a copy of a tabloid newspaper in Central London was while he was recording an edition of Have I Got News For You.

His publicity agent called his wife Sarah to warn her that the following day’s Daily Mirror would have six pages about Paul’s supposed cocaine habit.

After a sleepless night, he opened the paper to discover, much to his relief, that the cocaine user in question was actually Paul Merson, the Arsenal and England footballer, who is now a TV pundit.

Paul Merton tells these stories lightly and with self-deprecation. After all, the lure of comedy has never been far away.

In his youth he worked briefly as a meat packer for Sainsbury’s and for three years as a civil servant for Tooting employment office in South London. But, to the dismay of his parents, he gave up secure employment without knowing whether he’d ever make more than the few quid his early gigs brought in.

Even when he was losing his virginity — the moment, he says, when ‘the young gazelle becomes a man’ — with a girl called Leslie, whom he met in a pub, the then 20-year-old Merton was distracted by comedy.

They were in the middle of the act itself when a joke popped into his head so good that he was desperate not to forget it.

‘“Leslie,” I said, “I’m sorry, do you mind if we stop for a moment … I’ve just got to write something down.”’

So was it worth the interruption? Judge for yourself. The joke was: ‘I learned French the hard way — from a Spaniard.’
