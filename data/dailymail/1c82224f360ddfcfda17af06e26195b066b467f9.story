Australians are forking out hundreds of dollars on unnecessary credit card interest with the big four banks when they could be getting a better deal by using any of 20 other cards on the market.

ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac still charge around 20 per cent interest on credit cards but consumers can reduce their purchase interest rate by more than 10 per cent by ditching their products, a review of credit cards by consumer advocacy group CHOICE claims.

People sign up for credit cards with the big four because they 'automatically think they will get the best deal', CHOICE spokesman Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia.

According to the RBA, in August 2014 the average high rate credit card charges 19.75 per cent, while the best rate on offer is 8.99 per cent through Community First McGrath Pink Visa and Low rate visa.

Consumers can reduce their purchase interest rate by more than 10 per cent by ditching credit cards supplied by the big four banks ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac 

Victoria Teachers Mutual Bank Visa Platinum, Maritime, Mining and Power Credit Union Visa and Bank Mecu then come in at 9.99 per cent, 10.12 and 10.14 respectively.

For someone with a $2000 debt, paying off $50 a month with the average high rate credit card with a 19.75 per cent interest rate, it will take five years and six months and they will pay $1,289 in interest.

However, they could save $903 on the same debt by switching to a credit card with an interest rate of 8.99 per cent - offered by credit union Community First McGrath Pink Visa and Low rate visa. 

With this card - the number one in Australia for low purchase interest - it will only take four years to pay off the same amount and they will only pay $386 in interest.

The credit cards with the lowest purchase rates  in Australia are offered by credit unions.

Community First, McGrath Pink Visa: 8.99% 

Victoria Teachers Mutual Bank: 9.99% 

Maritime, Mining & Power Credit Union: 10.12%  

Bankmecu: 10.14%

The big four's 'low-rate' cards have an interest rate of 14 per cent. But Mr Godfrey says 'they are still a long way from the best deals on offer'.

ANZ Low Rate: 13.49%

CBA Low Rate Credit Card: 13.49% 

NAB's Low Rate Card: 13.99% 

Westpac Low Rate Credit Card: 13.49%  

The advocacy group has named the top 20 credit cards on the market and surprisingly the big four banks are nowhere to be seen on the list.

Mr Godfrey said people stay with the top four for their credit cards because of a 'perceived trust' and also because they have their other banking facilities, such as their mortgage, with those banks.

'With the big four we've got to separate credit cards from those other products - you've got to focus on the interest rate and research the best deal,' he explained.

Mr Godfrey reasoned that the best interest rates on credit cards are actually offered by credit unions not the main banks.

'Australians are bombarded with advertising from the big four banks and what this shows is the best rates are offered by credit unions and with the top card you are also giving money to charity, it's a very good deal indeed,' Mr Godfrey said.

He advised that if you really want to stay with a major bank they should call and ask for a better rate.

'Don't assume the first product they offer will be best product, you need to go in there and do your homework first. Push them for a better rate particularly if you are carrying a balance forward,' Mr Godfrey said.

Australia's big four banks are nowhere to be seen in a new list of the top 20 credit cards on the market

Earlier this year it was revealed 19 per cent of Australians are living off their credit card to get through to pay day.

'They should be called debt cards. You should try to pay them off as soon as possible. If you do have more than one card then it's really good to get free advice from a financial counsellor,' Mr Godfrey advised.

• Find out what interest rate you are paying on your credit card

• If your interest rate is 14% or more it’s time to switch

• If you want to stay with a major bank call them and ask for a better rate

• Create a direct debit to pay as much as you can but at least the minimum payment each month to avoid late fees and a listing on your credit report

• Every dollar extra above the minimum balance saves you interest.

Consumers should carry out their own research to find out what card is best for them.
