Police officers at this year's Hempfest festival in Seattle will dish out bags of Doritos with messages outlining the new marijuana laws in Washington

Normally when the police show up it means the party's over.

But police officers in Seattle will be adding to the fun this weekend by providing snacks at an marijuana festival.

Seattle Police Department's spokesman, Sergeant Sean Whitcomb, said the department intends to use the opportunity to spread the word about new marijuana laws, by attaching a summarized version to bags of Doritos.

The law came into effect in 2012, and allows anyone to legally possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana. 

But police are worried people still aren't clear enough on the rules.

So, with the help of a former journalist, the Seattle Police Department has composed its own guide to the law , 'Marijwhatnow?'.

“When the laws changed, there was a little bit of an informational vacuum about how police would react,” Whitcomb told nbc news. 

'Marijwhatnow' clearly states that Seattle police will not arrest anyone for possessing under an ounce of marijuana, but also outlines the rules that do still exist in the state, and at federal level.

Hempfest is an annual Seattle event where marijuana enthusiasts gather in protest of strict cannabis laws. It is expected to attract over 200,000 people this weekend

Police will hand out 1,000 bags of Doritos at Hempfest 2013, which is expected to attract around 200,000 people.

'We’re there to let people know what the rules are.

Not everybody will get a bag, but hopefully people will talk about what’s allowed and what’s not.'

Seattle's Hempfest is the largest gathering advocating cannabis decriminalization in the world. It is expected to span two miles of Seattle parks on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Sergeant Whitcomb is also a due to speak at the three-day event.

'We wanted to do something in a fun way that said, "look this is cool and everything but the rules are the rules"he said.

'I’ll probably throw out a few bags of Doritos.'

Can I legally carry around an ounce of marijuana?

According to the recently passed initiative, beginning December 
6th, adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce 
of marijuana for personal use. Please note that the initiative says it “is 
unlawful to open a package containing marijuana…in view of the general public,” 
so there’s that. Also, you probably shouldn’t bring pot with you to the federal 
courthouse (or any other federal property).

Where can I legally buy pot, then?

The Washington State Liquor Control Board is working to establish guidelines 
for the sale and distribution of marijuana. The WSLCB has until December 1, 2013 
to finalize those rules. In the meantime, production and distribution of 
non-medical marijuana remains illegal.

Can I grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends, family, 
and co-workers?

Not right now. In the future, under state law, you may be able to get a 
license to grow or sell marijuana.

Can I smoke pot outside my home? Like at a park, magic show, or the 
Bite of Seattle?

Much like having an open container of alcohol in public, doing so could 
result in a civil infraction—like a ticket—but not arrest. You can certainly use 
marijuana in the privacy of your own home. Additionally, if smoking a cigarette 
isn’t allowed where you are (say, inside an apartment building or flammable 
chemical factory), smoking marijuana isn’t allowed there either.

Will police officers be able to smoke marijuana?

As of right now, no. This is still a very complicated issue.

If I apply for a job at the Seattle Police Department, will past (or 
current) marijuana use be held against me? The current standard for 
applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years. In 
light of I-502, the department will consult with the City Attorney and the State 
Attorney General to see if and how that standard may be revised.

What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I’ve been 
smoking pot?

If an officer believes you’re driving under the influence of anything, they 
will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition 
expert. If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct 
and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason 
to believe you’re under the influence of something, they can get a warrant for a 
blood draw from a judge. If you’re in a serious accident, then a blood draw will 
be mandatory.

The Seattle Police Department seized a bunch of my marijuana before I-502 passed. Can I have it 
back?

No.

Will Seattle Police Department assist federal law enforcement in investigations of 
marijuana users or marijuana-related businesses, that are allowed under 
I-502?

No. Officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of 
anything that’s not prohibited by state law.

December 6th seems like a really long ways away. What 
happens if I get caught with marijuana before then?   Hold your breath. 
Your case will be processed under current state law. However, there is already a 
city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement 
priority.

I’m under 21. What happens if I get caught smoking pot?

It’s a violation of state law. It may referred to prosecutors, just like if 
you were a minor in possession of alcohol.
