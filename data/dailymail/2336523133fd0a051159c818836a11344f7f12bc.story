A Texas meteorologist who was shot last month outside the Waco area TV station where he works has returned to the air — wearing a Superman T-shirt.

Patrick Crawford presented the Monday morning forecast at KCEN.

KCEN's on-air and control room staff wore T-shirts Monday bearing the Superman logo on the front and the words 'Crawford Strong' on the back.

Surprise: Waco, Texas-area TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford ripped open his shirt to reveal a Superman shirt as he appeared behind the desk of KCEN for the first time since he was shot multiple times outside the studio last month

Crawford then opened his button-down shirt to reveal his own Superman T-shirt.

'I timed my comeback very nicely with today's forecast,' he said. 'We've got great weather today. We can expect the warm weather we saw over the weekend to return again today.'

Authorities are hunting for the man who shot Crawford three times on December 17 as the meteorologist was starting to drive home from the station.

Crawford spent several days in a hospital but was back in fighting form this week.

'It's good to be back. A little difficult waking up early this morning to get back to the station, but I am glad to be back,' he joked.

Authorities are still investigating the attack. The Associated Press left a message Monday seeking comment from the Department of Public Safety. 

No motive had previously been uncovered for the shooting and police are offering $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect.

Thrilled: The anchor desk was all about celebrating Crawford's return on Monday and donned t-shirts to prove it

Crawford strong: Crawford's co-workers surprised him with the shirts, though he soon surprised them right back

Crawford revealed late last month that the attack came out of nowhere.

'There was no interaction,' Crawford said at a press conference while in a wheelchair. 'He just started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot. '

Two of the bullets hit Crawford, one on the arm and another in the abdomen.

A third bullet grazed his head. 

The weatherman managed to drive off and stopped his car in a construction zone, where workers called an ambulance. 

Falls County Crime Stoppers originally offered a reward of $5,000 for information, but an anonymous donor contributed an additional $5,000 and the station added $10,000.

A composite sketch of the shooter was released by police , leading to many calls to Texas Rangers and other law enforcement officials but not to an arrest.

'There was no interaction,' Crawford recalled of the moment a man opened fire on him. 'He just started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot'
