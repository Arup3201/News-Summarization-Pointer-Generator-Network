Row: Iain Duncan Smith has had a huge row with his party's chief whip over treatment during this week's contentious EU debate

Iain Duncan Smith has threatened to quit the Government if David Cameron ever again tries to force him to vote against his Eurosceptic principles.

The Work and Pensions Secretary and former Conservative leader had an extraordinary stand-up row with Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin as MPs were ordered to oppose a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU, the Daily Mail has learned.

‘Iain said, “If you ever put me in this position again, that’s it”. He was extremely unimpressed with how the whole thing had been handled, and made clear what he would do if there’s any repeat,’ said one MP who witnessed the confrontation late on Monday night.

Several Cabinet ministers are understood to share a widespread view on Tory backbenches that Mr Cameron blundered badly when he decided to turn a vote designed as a non-binding expression of the view of Parliament on Britain’s future in the EU into a trial of strength.

A rebellion gathered pace, rather than receded, after the Prime Minister announced he was rushing the vote forward so he could attend himself and imposing a three-line whip – the toughest party instruction on how to vote – as well as threatening with the sack Government members who stepped out of line.

The two most staunchly Eurosceptic members of the Cabinet, Mr Duncan Smith and Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, would have had to quit if they had joined a record 81 MPs who rebelled against Mr Cameron.

Yesterday, in an attempt to calm the row, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude insisted that the Coalition was committed to ‘rebalancing’ Britain’s relationship with Europe. Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers are understood to have extracted a promise from the Foreign Office that it will publish an analysis on how powers might be repatriated from Brussels.

But today Downing Street is accused of branding a hardcore of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs ‘sh**s’ – a claim that will further infuriate the rebels.

Abuse: Former Prime Minister John Major called rebels against him 'bastards' while David Cameron's aides are allegedly calling EU rebels 'sh**s'

As Mr Cameron faced renewed demands to use German calls for talks on EU treaty changes as part of the deal to save the euro as an opportunity to claw back powers from Brussels, his inner circle was said to have referred one group of rebel MPs in the most disparaging terms.

Sources close to him have called Tory Eurosceptics the ‘30 or 40 sh**s’ – a latter-day equivalent of John Major’s ‘bastards’, who he blamed for disrupting his premiership over European policy – according to the Spectator magazine.

In the Commons, the Prime Minister said his Government had already taken back powers by extracting the UK from the European bailout fund to shore up Greece’s economy.

He branded Labour leader Ed Miliband a ‘complete mug’ for saying he did not think Brussels had too many powers.

‘The Coalition agreement does talk about rebalancing power between Britain and Europe,’ he said.

Mr Cameron admitted there were differences between the Coalition parties, saying the Liberal Democrats wanted ‘some rebalancing’ and the Tories ‘a lot of rebalancing’.

Mr Miliband, however, was ‘a complete mug who wants no rebalancing at all’. There are intriguing signs of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats shifting their position, raising the possibility that they might agree to an attempt to negotiate a limited repatriation of powers.

Former leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘I don’t think Europe needs to be as intrusive as it is and so does Nick Clegg.

‘What we’re talking about here is Europe having a greater say in the world because you work more closely together on defence, on security, on foreign affairs, on trade, where our future safety and jobs lie in a very inhospitable world, and at the same time we allow greater variation of nations to be able to govern their affairs on all those issues that touch on the citizen. I think that’s a more sensible balance.

‘But where Nick is right is in saying you can’t do this by unilateral grab – you can’t do that because the others will say “Thank you very much, no”.’

Several senior figures said privately that No 10 needed to shake up its political operation and reach out urgently to disaffected backbenchers. They warned Mr Cameron’s difficulties with his party went beyond Europe, suggesting he needed to change his leadership style and break out of his ‘cliquey’ inner circle.

There is particular alarm in Tory high command at the number of new MPs who joined the rebellion.

Of the 2010 intake, 48 broke ranks with Mr Cameron and voted in favour of a referendum. There are now calls for Mr Cameron to broaden his inner circle to improve relations.

‘Michael Fallon [deputy party chairman] is the only Thatcherite in Downing Street,’ said one source.

Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, one of those who defied the Prime Minister, accused Mr Cameron of using ‘bullying tactics’ to try to force MPs into line.

However, supporters of an EU referendum were warned they risk costing the party victory at the next general election. Major Tory donor and former party deputy chairman

Lord Ashcroft branded the rebellion over Europe ‘self-indulgent’, and warned the message it will send to voters is that the party does not share their priorities.

He called on Tory MPs to get the issue of Europe ‘in proportion’ and focus on issues that really matter to voters – such as the economy, jobs, healthcare, crime and immigration.
