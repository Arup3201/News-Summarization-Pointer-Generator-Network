It is games like this, just as much as Champions League matches, when Jose Mourinho illustrates his mastery of the substitution.

Having just seen his team concede a remarkable equaliser 13 minutes from the final whistle that seemed likely to send this Capital One Cup tie into extra time, the Chelsea manager immediately threw on Willian and Nemanja Matic.

In his first involvement, the Brazilian conjured a goal that spared any blushes. He raced down the left and produced a cross so troubling that Jermaine Grandison diverted into his own net with Didier Drogba lurking.

Remember when Mourinho acted quicker than Sir Alex Ferguson as Nani was dismissed against his Real Madrid side in Europe's elite competition? This was of similar ilk.

It was cruel on Shrewsbury, who barely three minutes earlier made it appear the impossible might be on. Liam Lawrence delivered a dangerous corner, Grandison nodded down and Andy Mangan prodded past Petr Cech 83 seconds after arriving from the bench himself.

Greenhous Meadow, boasting a record crowd for a football match thanks to 486 extra temporary seats, erupted so loud the whole of Shropshire would have heard.

Mellon calls himself the Special Brew to Mourinho's Special One, in light of the ale that has been created in his name by a local brewery.

He must be credited with fermenting a formula that for the entire first half kept a team of vastly greater ability and resources at bay.

That was until the appearance of the Special Drog. At 36, this is some winter to his career. Every day is Christmas it seems.

Drogba scored the opening goal here, his third goal in three games to give his team a foothold in a game they occasionally looked like slipping up in.

Three minutes after the interval he applied a sure finish to Mohamed Salah's through ball, following a flick from Andre Schurrle.

Mourinho questioned the application of some players he was giving a rare start to in light of the Ivorian striker who does not wilt.

'If players that played 90 minutes two days ago were fantastic I expect people who are not playing a lot to raise the level to create me problems,' Mourinho said. 'I love problems of choices, and it is easy to choose my team for Saturday.

'Hopefully Didier will be good for the weekend but we will have to see because right now his character is stronger than his body.

Gary Cahill managed to avoid any headlocks in attacking corners and was well behaved when defending them. Nothing needing the attentions of referee Neil Swarbrick here. 

'That's what makes players special and if I was a kid player with this guy on my side what can I wish more? For the kids it is a privilege and they have to learn by example.'

Drogba added: 'I played here before, with Galatasaray. Shrewsbury have improved since then. It was difficult tonight with the weather. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the game. It was difficult but I started playing in places like this.'

This was the Premier League leaders, unbeaten in six months, against a side in League Two who have been bettered by Hartlepool, Stevenage and Southend this season.

Chelsea's squad cost around £300million to assemble. Shrewsbury's? Nothing. The teams are separated by 72 places in the league ladder.

It was David lining up against Goliath, except Goliath was on springs and David had two hands behind his back.

Still, Mourinho retained four of his starters from Sunday's match at Manchester United little more than 48 hours earlier.

Gary Cahill, Filipe Luis, and Oscar all began alongside Drogba. This was the first time he had started back-to-back games for Chelsea since April 2012, when the opponents on both occasions within a week were Barcelona.

Greenhous Meadow is no Nou Camp, but it is a finer stadium than you might expect for a League Two club.

Mellon has crafted a team who like to pass the ball, and in Ryan Woods have an excellent midfielder. For large swathes they worried Mourinho and when Mangan scored a shock was stirring.

Didier Drogba has scored in each of his last three matches - in three different competitions. He found the net against Maribor in the Champions League, Manchester United in the Premier League and Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup. 

'To get everyone out of their chairs was one of the things we wanted to do,' said Mellon. 'We're trying to re-build a football club and I cant say how proud I am of my players.'

Shrewsbury had the first chance in the fourth minute. Lawrence delivered a corner that Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro rose to head down, forcing Petr Cech to palm away.

Shrewsbury were the team conducting incisive attacks. Akpa Akpro's pace particularly troubled Chelsea. One passing move started from the back and involved six Shrewsbury players before James Collins sent his header wide.

Chelses were curiously unsure. Just after the half hour, Drogba set Salah away on a counter attack and when he picked out Schurrle in the middle it seemed a goal was inevitable. But the German World Cup winner instead nodded back across and Shrewsbury scrambled clear.

That may influence who starts against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. 'At the end we had a glass of wine,' said Mellon. 'He is an example for any young manager how to operate.'

Mourinho and Drogba, examples alike.
