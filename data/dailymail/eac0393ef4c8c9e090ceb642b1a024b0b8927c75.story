WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange has lost his High Court bid to block extradition to Sweden where he faces sex crime allegations.

Two judges rejected claims that extraditing the 40-year-old Australian would be 'unfair and unlawful'.

The Swedish authorities want Assange, a 40-year-old Australian, to answer accusations of 'raping' one woman and 'sexually molesting and coercing' another in Stockholm in August last year.

Today, the High Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Howard Riddle 
at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south London, in February that the 
computer expert should be extradited to face investigation.

Assange, whose WikiLeaks website 
published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several 
governments and international businesses, denies the allegations and 
says they are politically motivated.

Assange's supporters, including journalist John Pilger, gathered outside the High Court in London today awaiting his arrival.

But, there was no sign of the celebrity circus that supported him earlier this year, including socialite Jemima Khan, Tony Benn, Bianca Jagger, and film-maker Ken Loach.

Ms Khan publicly contributed £20,000 towards Assange's £200,000 bail when he was arrested in December last year.

court building and police had to redirect him away from the crowd.

Assange nodded and smiled at his supporters, who broke into a round of applause as he passed.

Fixed to the iron railings of the court were banners reading 'Free Assange! Free Manning! End the wars'.

However, moments later the judges ruled that the issuing of the European arrest warrant 
(EAW) that led to Assange's arrest and all subsequent proceedings to 
achieve extradition were 'proportionate'.

They dismissed Assange's argument that the warrant was invalid 
because it had been issued by a prosecutor, and not a 'judicial 
authority'.

The judges held the action of the prosecutor was subject to the 
independent scrutiny of Swedish judges, 'which, as judges of another 
(EU) member state, we must respect'.

The court also rejected Assange's assertion that the descriptions of 
the offences were not a fair and accurate description of the conduct 
alleged against him.

Bradley Manning is the detained American soldier alleged to have 
leaked hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.

The judges said that any application by Assange to appeal to the Supreme Court would be decided at a further hearing at a date to be fixed.

Assange showed no emotion and made notes while President of the Queen's Bench Division, Sir John Thomas, read out a summary of the court's reasons for its ruling.

The Assange legal challenge, which has attracted worldwide attention, centred on a European arrest warrant (EAW) issued by a Swedish prosecutor which led to Assange's arrest in December last year.

His QC, Ben Emmerson, argued at a two-day hearing in July that the prosecutor was not a 'judicial authority' entitled to issue the EAW.

The warrant had also contained 'fundamental misstatements' of what occurred in Stockholm last August while Assange was in Sweden to give a lecture, said the QC.

One of Assange's supporters who did turn up was journalist John Pilger who is pictured talking to reporters outside the High Court

Assange's encounters with the two women involved consensual sex and would not be considered crimes in England, he said.

The EAW was misleading in its accusations that he had used violence or 'acted in a manner to violate sexual integrity', said Mr Emmerson.

Assange burst into the public 
consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - 
video footage of a US air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007.

The
whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million 
documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines 
in 2010 with a series of leaks.

The
US Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were 
drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise the profile of Assange.

He
recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending
its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial 
blockade and raising new funds.

The
stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and 
unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, 
MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange.

These 'mis-descriptions' were at odds with descriptions given by the women themselves about what had occurred.

Supporters outside the court said they were 'outraged' by the judges' decision.

Susan Gianstefani, 44, held a sign asking: 'Why are we persecuting the innocent?'

The Australian Christian worker, who had come from south London with 
her husband to show her support, said: 'I think he's a hero for truth 
and exposing corruption.

'I think they're out to get him - the system in general and, I think, the US and Australian governments.

'He's made a lot of enemies in high places.'

Ciaron O'Reilly, 51, said: 'We've got to stop the war and free Assange and Bradley Manning.

'Assange is probably the most amazing person in recent history who's 
upset so many powerful people in such a short space of time so it's 
obviously not a level playing field.'

His fans declared they would continue to give Assange their full support.

In July, the High Court heard how Assange told a woman he stands accused of raping that he wanted to impregnate her and other ‘virgins’ in August last year after he visited Sweden to give a lecture.

He is said to have told his alleged victim in Stockholm: ‘Sweden is a good country to have kids in.’

The court also heard that Assange had a ‘strange’ discussion with the museum worker and she later awoke to find him having unprotected sex with her.

He is accused of saying he ‘wanted to impregnate women’ and that he ‘preferred virgins because he would be the first to impregnate them’.

The former computer hacker is also accused of ‘violently’ forcing himself on another woman in Stockholm.

Assange denies the allegations and has always claimed that they were politically motivated and linked to the 
activities of the whistleblower website.

A warrant was issued for his arrest in August last year, but was rescinded after a prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape. He remained in Sweden for thirty eight days but another European Arrest Warrant was issued on November 18 2010.

This article was amended on 8 March. An earlier version stated that a ‘warrant was issued for his arrest in August last year. Mr Assange left Sweden eight days later after a prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape. But another European Arrest Warrant was issued on September 1.’ In fact, the warrant for Mr Assange’s arrest was rescinded after the prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape. Mr Assange then remained in Sweden for thirty eight days but another European Arrest Warrant was issued on November 18 2010.
