If I'd know then what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies, I'd have gone to work dressed as Madonna circa her Blonde Ambition tour, says middle-aged Lorraine

Underwear has dominated the week, making a guest appearance in most areas of my life. What can  I say? Things get unpredictable in a relentless heatwave.

On Sunday, my two-year-old firmly rejected her much-delayed move from nappies to knickers. ‘No, thank you. I’m busy,’ she said when I repeatedly asked if she fancied a trip to the loo. Her preferred venue is the lawn. Anyone’s lawn.

She stubbornly put her pile of new Marks & Spencer pants by the back door. The dog stood staring at Cinderella’s little face on the mat for ages.

Just as I’m trying to get the smallest child into knickers, I’m delicately persuading the eldest she needs a bra.

It’s becoming an emergency situation, frankly. But she finds talking to me about this so excruciatingly embarrassing that I think she’d prefer it if the supermarket checkout man relayed the news to her.

Then I notice that the ever-so pretty young women at work appear to have introduced ‘wear your bikini to work’  day, soaked in heat as we are right now.

Given that most of them are prettier versions of Gloria from Modern Family, this is depressing. Not for them - they look amazing in their tiny crop-tops and city shorts. But for me in the week I turned 45, it was further proof that my underwear must stay hidden for evermore.

I curse the fact that I didn’t wear shorter skirts, tighter tops and fewer clothes generally in my 20s.

If I’d know then what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies, I’d have gone to work dressed as Madonna circa her Blonde Ambition tour. Really, I would. So, in celebration of being more than halfway through my life, statistically speaking, I had all my hair chopped off.

The crisis of the underwear drove me to do something for me - that, and the ridiculous pressure of the to-do list that dominates a working mum’s build-up to the summer holidays.

There are activity clubs, play dates, birthdays and craft wotsits to factor in. The days when school’s out are a non-stop, multi-layered programme of activity.

And at this time of year, I always celebrate something more important than just being one year older. Yes, dear reader, I rejoice in the sisterhood.

Surprised? You shouldn’t be - women are the glue that holds together the fabric of society. When needs must, we really do pull it out of the bag. 

School's out for summer: But while the children celebrate, parents must go into overdrive to entertain them

It’s the sisterhood that gets mums through school holidays. Without other mums metaphorically stepping into each other’s shoes, the whole darn system would collapse.

Top of the class

Fifteen-year-olds in England get 950 hours of compulsory education over a year - more than the global average

The rota of collecting, dropping off and generally ‘just minding’ is a work of some genius - further proof that if we did run the world, the whole thing would be more peaceful and profitable. The school holidays are women at their best - a support network of fiercely organised thoughtfulness. It’s a wonder to behold.

Petty school-gate niggles are forgotten, thorny PTA debates abandoned, the whole working versus non-working riddle is rendered irrelevant in the face of a schedule filled with free activities.

We speed around the  country, laden down with children, before texting and phoning through locations and times to each other with remarkable accuracy.

It’s an all-conquering system as we mentally download all the information on each other’s children and their holiday schedules.

If you asked us to land a lunar rover on the moon during these weeks, we’d simply insert that into our plans, accomplish it and move on to the next task.

This school break is like bootcamp for parents: we have to be ready, we have to be prepared and we have to be fit for purpose!

It’s the ultimate debit/credit scheme of favours, without an official record book. And it works a treat.

Embrace it, I implore you, and share what you learn over the years, please. If we’d run the economy like mums run the school holidays, we’d all be millionaires today.

To quote Beyonce, and I feel one must every now and again: ‘Who run the world? Girls!’
