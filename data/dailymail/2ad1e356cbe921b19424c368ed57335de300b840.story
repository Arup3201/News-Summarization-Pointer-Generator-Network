Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been voted Australia's most popular politician ahead of 18 other male members of the Government.

The only woman of the 19-member team of cabinet ministers was rated number one ahead of Malcolm Turnbull, second, with Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey finishing in 14th  and 19th place respectively.

The survey of 1004 Australian voters was conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research just before the first anniversary of the Abbott government's election victory. 

Participants were asked to rank each minister on a scale of 100 for excellent, 75 for good, 50 for average, 25 for poor or zero for terrible.

Ms Bishop, who finished with the top score of 57.6, said she was delighted by the result but considered the efforts of her 'team' was what contributed to her top place. 

'I'm delighted to be considered in that light, but let's focus on the team effort,' Ms Bishop told AAP on Tuesday.

'Our team have been delivering on those core promises that we took to the last election.'

Malcolm Turnbull was the crowd favourite when the survey was carried out six months ago, but the communications minister had to settle for second best this time.

Ms Bishop has been far more prominent at home and abroad this year, most notably spearheading Australia's campaign at the United Nations to condemn the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. 

Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott slipped in the placings, while Christopher Pyne, left, finished second last

She has been tipped by pundits and party insiders as a future Liberal prime minister. 

Current Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, who have both been dealing with fallout from an unpopular May Budget, polled 39.1 and 32.1 respectively.

Mr Hockey dropped from third-most-popular position in the previous survey in December, while Mr Abbott slipped slightly lower than his result in the previous poll.

The McNair first-year scorecard, conducted between 27 and 30 August, involved a 'nationally representative' selection of members of an online panel, the company said. 

It said the results were weighted to population statistics by age, gender and location.

The lead researcher, Matt Balogh, said it was not surprising that ministers were more well known to the public now than at the time of the last survey, taken at the 100-day mark of the government.

'In both cases we actually asked people whether they felt they knew each politician well enough to rate them and the ratings are only taken amongst people who said they knew that person well enough,' he said.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison polled in third position behind Malcolm Turnbull
