Neymar took time out to celebrate Brazil's recent win over Argentina with a team selfie in Singapore.

Neymar, recently installed as captain of the Selecao, was pictured alongside Gil, David Luiz, Kaka, Robinho, Everton Ribeiro, Elias and Diego Tardelli as the squad enjoyed a day out together.

The squad, who have made a near 3,000 trip to get to Singapore from Beijing, looked in buoyant mood in the photo posted on Neymar's Instagram account, after securing a third successive win.

Diego Tardelli scored a brace as Dunga's side secured a 2-0 win over their South American arch-rivals on Saturday. 

As a result Dunga remains unbeaten as Brazil boss since taking over from Luiz Felipe Scolari after the World Cup, as they eye a fourth straight win against China on Tuesday. 

Dunga's side also come up against Turkey and Austria next month in friendlies, as they continue their resurgence under the former Brazil midfielder.
