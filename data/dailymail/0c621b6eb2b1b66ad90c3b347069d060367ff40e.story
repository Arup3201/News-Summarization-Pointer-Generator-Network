It is no secret that woman fake orgasms as Meg Ryan proved in that famous scene of When Harry Met Sally, however just how many of them are faking and their reasons why might surprise you.

In a new survey commissioned by Cosmopolitan revealed that 67 per cent of the 2,300 of the women surveyed had faked an orgasm with a partner. 

The reasons for faking were to spare a partners feelings (28 per cent) but the remainder of women said that it was because they wanted to end the session more quickly (27 per cent).

A new survey of 2,300 women has revealed the truth behind their orgasms 

The survey also suggests that when it comes to The Big O women's pleasure isn't always a priority. 

Some 57 per cent of those surveyed said that they orgasmed most or every time they had sex with a partner while 95 per cent believed that their other half orgasm every time they have intercourse.

Shockingly 72 per cent of women admitted that their partners have climaxed without helping them to finish despite 78 per cent agreeing that they believed their partner cared about pleasuring them. 

The survey also explored when women experienced their first orgasm with the majority (27 per cent) claiming it was between the age of 17 and 19 shortly after the age of consent.

Women who complained they weren't orgasming with their partner pointed to a number of reasons from being 'almost there' but unable to 'quite get over the edge' (50 per cent) to 'not the right kind' of stimulation from their partner (35 per cent).

For 32 per cent, being 'in my own head' or too focused on how they look prevents them from reaching a climax.  

When it comes to reasons for not quite finishing most agreed they were often close but not close enough

Some 72 per cent of women admitted that they have experienced selfish sex with a partner 

However, when asked how they had they experienced their first orgasm most women said it was down to experimenting rather than with the help of a boyfriend/girlfriend.

Reasons for a first climax included masturbation, water jets in the bath and accidental stimulation when making contact with furniture. 

Despite the struggles in climaxing with a partner the survey revealed that almost all women surveyed had experienced an orgasm at one point or another. 

For 84 per cent of women, they had their first one age between 18 and 24, for 92 per cent, it happened before the age of 29 and 96 per cent of women over the age of 30 had an orgasm. 

An overwhelming 67 per cent of women admitted to faking an orgasm with reasons being that they wanted to spare a partner's feelings or wanted the sex to end quicker 

When it comes to the most efficient way of climaxing it appeared that working alone worked best

The majority of participants experienced their first orgasm between the age of 17-19

And most of women's first orgasms were down to experimenting alone
