An energy saving scheme championed by the Government could be causing homes to overheat.Ministers are encouraging homeowners to improve insulation and install other environmental measures under their flagship Green Deal.

But experts warn that while insulation may save energy in the winter, it could trap in excessive heat during the summer months if badly installed. It poses a particular health risk for the elderly, who could ‘die from overheating’.

A report by a climate research group warned ‘Green Deal measures could create new problems in the future, with inappropriately-insulated properties experiencing poor indoor air quality and significant summer overheating’.

The government's Green Deal initiative is designed to encourage home owners to install green technologies in their homes to help the environment and cut energy bills. However, these same energy-efficiency measures can pose a health risk in hot weather

The Government said it was aware of the risk and guidance is already in place to prevent inappropriate installations.

Studies suggest there may be 
typically around 2,000 deaths due to heat each year, compared to around 
25,000 as a result of the cold.

But according to research group 
Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing Climate, ‘if action is not 
taken’ on the issue, heat-related deaths could more than double from 
2,000 to 5,000 by 2080.

The Green Deal, launched by Chris 
Huhne, offers homeowners loans for works such as cavity wall insulation 
and energy-efficient boilers, in the hope of reducing their energy bill.

Households must pay for an assessment
of what upgrades their house needs, which costs around £150. But so 
far, only four households have signed up and a further 241 have 
indicated they intended to.

Top floor flats in 1960s tower blocks and modern detached houses are most at risk of becoming dangerously hot inside during a heatwave, especially if they are south-facing, according to the research

Dr Chris Goodier, of Loughborough 
University’s department of civil and building engineering, said the risk
of overheating has been overlooked in the ‘big rush to insulate and 
make homes airtight’, particularly as the nation could face more extreme
weather in the future.

In a study with Prof Li Shao, of the 
University of Reading, he found that heat was likely to have a 
‘significantly greater’ impact on the elderly or infirm who were more 
likely to be at home during the warmest daytime hours.

The elderly and infirm as well as people living on the top floor of 1960s tower blocks and modern detached houses are most at risk

Their research found that top floor 
flats in 1960s tower blocks, and modern detached houses were most at 
risk of over-heating, particularly if they were south facing.

‘Overheating is like the little boy 
at the back of the class waving his hand. It is forgotten about because 
the other challenges are so big,’ he told the BBC.

‘If you are in the wrong type of 
house, facing the wrong way, in the wrong street and you don’t deal with
heat in the right way, it is a problem.

‘Particularly for the elderly. They 
are going to suffer. Suffering means they are going to die from 
overheating.’ Doug King, an independent consultant in sustainable 
construction, said: ‘It is a problem. Typically British houses are built
for a fairly benign climate, not to deal with extremes.

‘It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t insulate these buildings, but it must be done properly.

‘Some properties - particularly 
top-floor flats and anything south facing - have a tendency to overheat,
so when you add insulation to the mix it can make things worse. But if 
the right ventilation is added, then the problem can be solved.’

A DECC spokesperson said: ‘The real 
problem facing our nation’s draughty homes is a lack of adequate 
insulation and energy efficiency in the colder months.

The Green Deal is giving households a
new way to fund improvements, helping them protect themselves against 
rising energy bills and keep homes warm and cosy in the autumn and 
winter.

‘If energy efficiency measures are 
installed appropriately, overheating should not be a common problem and 
there’s guidance available for those involved in the Green Deal.’

Temperatures could reach dangerous levels in some homes fitted with energy-saving measures like insulation, installed under Green Deal scheme

@highlight

Point of scheme was to save winter fuel bills and protect the environment

But experts are warning that heat that builds up in the day does not easily 
dissipate at night and leads to poor air quality, which could kill
