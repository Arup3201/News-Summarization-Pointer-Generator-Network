A nine-year-old transgender boy has made an incredibly brave video to tell the world that he has decided from now on he no longer wants to live life as a girl.

The touching words from Milla Brown, who lives in Brisbane, Queensland, has struck a chord among social media users with more than 3.5 million views of the unforgettable video that his mother Renee Fabish posted on Facebook.

The inspirational child, who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, speaks about the traumatic bullying he experiences on a daily basis at school and simply asks for people to accept the fact that he is now a boy.

Milla Brown makes a brave video to tell the world he no longer wants to live life as a girl

Milla has always loved trucks and train and almost never played with dolls

From as young as two, Milla would refer to himself as girl-boy - a girl that liked boy things

Milla introduces himself in the extraordinary video and then explains that: 'it's not easy being me' because he feels like he is in the wrong body.

'I am having a really hard time at school at the moment - kids tease me all of the time - they call me shim, gay girl and weirdo,' she said.

'People just don't understand me - nobody wants to be my friend.' 

'I just want people to accept me for who I am. I'm lucky that I have an awesome family who support me 100 per cent,' she says.

'I have decided I want to take the next step from today I want to live and be known as a boy I hope I have your support.'

When he was about six-years-old, Milla refused to wear girls clothes and constantly asked to have his hair cut off until his mother finally gave in

He always loved Ninja Turtles, Batman, Spiderman and Bob the Builder since he was little

His mother Renee also poured her heart out in the video via rolling text explaining the unique journey she has been through since Milla was born.

Born on May 15 in 2005, Milla Taige Brown was a healthy and happy baby girl who was full of personality.

'From as young as two Milla would refer to herself as girl-boy - a girl that liked boy things from very early on,' she says.

'Milla insisted on wearing boys, undies pjs and dress ups - we didn't have a problem with that.'

A big fan of Batman, Spiderman, Bob the Builder and Ninja Turtles, Milla never played with dolls preferring trucks and trains. 

When he was about six-years-old, Milla refused to wear girls clothes and constantly asked to have hair cut off until Renee finally gave in.

'Everyone told us it was just a phase they'd say "shes just a tomboy - she'll grow out of it" - problem is phases end most tomboys don't want to be boys.'

The cracks began to show when the once bubbly child became increasingly unhappy. 

'One day Milla came to me in tears saying is there any medicine I could buy to turn her into a boy,' Renee said.

'She started making comments like "why was I born like this?", "I want to be a boy - not just look like one, I want to be a real boy".'

'I could see Milla slowly becoming withdrawn and depressed. She was going to bed in tears every night.'

The tortured young child also couldn't bear the thought of growing breasts.

'She became increasingly distressed at the thought of growing boobs she said "If I grow boobs I am going to cut them off",' Renee said.

Once it became clear that the tomboy phase was not going to end, Milla was diagnosed with gender dysphoria after her parents took him to be see an endcronologist and a child psychiatrist. 

'Her gender assigned at birth does not align with how she feels inside - Milla was born female but her brain identifies as male,' Renee says.

'This is something that is in his genetic makeup it hasn't been caused or encouraged by our parenting.'

'It is not something she was talked into and it is not something she can be talked out of - it is what it is.' 

His parents were advised by doctors to let Milla transition as soon as possible.

'We have no doubt in our minds that Milla is fully invested in her plight to be recognised as a boy - the only thing that has changed for us is pronouns -  we support him wholeheartedly,' she said.

His family refuses to allow him to become the percentage of transgenders who self harm or attempt suicide

Renee said a frightening percentage of the transgender community suffer from mental health issues. 

'All due to the lack of acceptance and constant bullying they are subjected to everyday,' she said. 

'Around half self harm or attempt suicide - we are not willing to let our child become part of those statistics.'

Renee says her son is now extremely happy after making such a huge step. 

'All we can do is equip our son with the skills necessary to cope with small minded people,' she said.

'Being transgender is not a choice - trust me it's not a life you would choose for your child.

'Our child deserves the right to be happy like any other.' 

The video fittingly ends with a message to those who may judge their child. 

'Everybody is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Remember to be kind always'

Milla has never been happier since making the huge step to live his life as a boy
