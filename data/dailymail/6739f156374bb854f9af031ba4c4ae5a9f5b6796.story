Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has been pictured on state television just hours after rebels claimed to have attack his motorcade with shells.

The dictator was on his way to a mosque in Damascus today to celebrate the end of Ramadan when he apparently came under fire from the Free Syrian Army.

But government officials denied the claim, and a TV station controlled by the regime broadcast footage of Assad praying alongside the country's grand mufti.

The Tahrir al-Sham rebel brigade said it fired several artillery shells towards Assad's convoy in the heart of the capital and that at least some hit their target.

If confirmed, the attack would be one of the most direct against Assad in two years of civil war which have pitted mainly Sunni rebels against the Alawite president.

Rebels have targeted Assad's residences in Damascus and a bombing in the capital last year killed four of his inner circle, but there have been no reports of Assad himself coming under fire.

Video footage distributed by the rebels apparently showed smoke rising from the Malki district, where Assad and his close aides have homes. Other activists also reported rocket fire into the area.

However, the government information minister Omran Zoabi said: 'The news is wholly untrue.'

Firas al-Bitar, head of Tahrir al-Sham, said his fighters had carried out reconnaissance of the route of Assad's motorcade and fired 120mm artillery towards the president's convoy early on Thursday.

'The attack rattled the regime, even if Assad was not hit,' he said. 'There were two motorcades, one containing Assad and a decoy - we targeted the correct one.'

Bitar's brigade operates mainly in the Ghouta region of Damascus. Another Tahrir al-Sham official said Assad's forces fired rockets and artillery 'like rain' on the region in response to the reported attack.

Following the statement, Syrian state television showed footage of Assad praying with ministers and other top officials. It said the footage was from Thursday's Eid ul-Fitr prayers at the Anas bin Malek Mosque in Malki.

Assad appeared unharmed and smiled at the worshippers as he entered the mosque.

Islam Alloush of the Liwa al-Islam, another rebel brigade, said that rebels fired rockets which struck Assad's motorcade.

'Assad was not hit but the information we have based from sources within the regime is that there were casualties within his entourage,' he added.

More than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began as a largely peaceful uprising in March 2011.
