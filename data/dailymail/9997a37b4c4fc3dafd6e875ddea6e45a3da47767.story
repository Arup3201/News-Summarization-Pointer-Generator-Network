She recently unveiled her plans to sell £10,000 worth of tickets to watch her give birth live on Skype.

Now, controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has sparked further anger after encouraging unsuccessful A-level students to take up escort work.

The pregnant mother of two, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

She tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.'

The 24-year-old's comments came hundreds of thousands of A-level students across Britain collected their exam results this morning.

Unsurprisingly, Twitter users immediately hit out at Miss Cunningham, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS.

Bradley Cooper wrote: 'I must be speaking for half the population when I say I simply cannot express my level of anger towards Josie Cunningham.'

Meanwhile, Hazel Thorburn said: 'So Josie Cunningham says that if you fail your A levels go and escort... no selling your body is the low of the lowest.'

Becky Butcher added: 'Why is Josie Cunningham giving advice to A Level students? WHY? She is hardly a role model.'

And Peter Davison wrote: 'What a load of drivel @josiecunningham. Like any intelligent person is gonna take careers advice from you.'

It comes just a week after Miss Cunningham, whose baby son is due in October, revealed she is offering fans the chance to watch her give birth live on Skype.

At a cost of £200 each, 50 people will be 
able to log on to the video chat service and watch the former 
prostitute's delivery via videolink.

The wannabe model has already scooped a staggering £30,000 by selling four ringside seats to the birth of her third child at her home in Leeds.

Speaking last week, Miss Cunningham told The Sun her offer to watch her give birth live on Skype would be a 'magical experience' for her fans.

Response: Peter Davison wrote of Miss Cunningham's latest tweets: 'What a load of drivel @josiecunningham. Like any intelligent person is gonna take careers advice from you'

Surprised: Last month, Miss Cunningham announced to her Twitter fans that the ringside seats for her home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes, tweeting: 'WOW!' Just been told all 4 tickets have sold out in 14 minutes!'

'I'm annoyed at how cheap I sold the first four tickets,' she said. 'I think
 £200 to see such a magical experience is a bargain.'

Two
 days earlier, Miss Cunningham, who was recently spotted shopping at exclusive baby 
store Blue Almonds, where Kate Middleton bought items for Prince George 
before his birth, revealed that she plans to 
sell her placenta to the highest bidder.

She asked her 50,000 Twitter followers: 'Selling your placenta... is it 
legal? Any legal boffs wanna give me some free advic? (sic)'.

As well as the NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

She later added: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Last month, Miss Cunningham announced to her Twitter fans that the ringside seats for her home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes, tweeting: 'WOW!' Just been told all 4 tickets have sold out in 14 minutes!'

Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. 

Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each.

Cashing in: It comes just a week after Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she plans to sell her placenta to the highest bidder. She asked her fans: 'Any legal boffs wanna give me some free advic? (sic)?'

Miss Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos.

She formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes selling DVDs of the birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through.

Miss
 Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 
worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust
 from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She
 courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting 
the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the 
Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show. 

Confident: Not one to shy away from controvery, Miss Cunningham has built her career on winding people up

Miss
 Cunningham later said she was receiving negative attention on public 
transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi
 to take her children to school.

 Leeds City Council decided to axe the service, which prompted Ms 
Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers

She said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Initially,
 Miss Cunningham had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by 
selling DVDs of the event through a chain of pound shops.
