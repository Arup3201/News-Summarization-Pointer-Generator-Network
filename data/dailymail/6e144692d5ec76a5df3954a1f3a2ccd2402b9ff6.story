A dream home for golf fanatics has gone on sale for £4 million complete with its own championship length 18-hole course.

The unidentified owner designed the course himself after moving into historic Idehill Manor in Devon 10 years ago and it boasts the longest recognised golf hole in Britain - a 740 yard par six.

He has enjoyed the 
luxury of having the challenging course to himself on a daily basis, 
with family and friends occasionally joining him by invitation.

A rural residence, the only one with a championship size golf course in the grounds, has gone on sale for £4 million

Now aged in his 70s, the retired businessman is looking to downsize from the 16th century nine-bed manor house that was once owned by King George II and latterly by the Earl of Ilchester.

The grade II listed property, that comes with 51 acres of grounds with 'views to die for' according to the brochure, also includes a two bed yeoman's cottage complete with separate entrance.

It has gone on the market for £3.95 million.

At the moment a local greenkeeper is employed by the owner to maintain the course - the fairways and greens are cut once every fours days.

The main house has six reception rooms, a
snooker room, a heated swimming pool and original beams and fire 
places. The largely thatched building also features six bathrooms with 
the master bedroom overlooking the pool and adjoining sun terrace.

The pensioner, who shares the property in Farway, near Honiton, with his wife, said he will be sad to leave the home.

He said: 'It is the only private championship-length golf course on the British Isles and it does have the longest hole in the country as well.

'We bought the house 10 years ago. I’m a keen golfer and I had 50 acres of land to myself so it made sense.

'I designed the course myself and the first tee is only 100 yards from the main entrance.

The property also comes with this stunning two-bedroom cottage complete with its own entrance driveway

'The course extends to three sides of the house and is very sympathetic to the landscape, which is one of the reasons why it doesn’t have any bunkers.

'The other reason is due to maintenance, as you don’t have to worry about cutting around them.

'The best time to play is at 7am on a Sunday when all you can hear are the birds and sheep.

'You don’t have to worry about waiting your turn to play or other golfers whistling a shot past your head.

'We do have to down-size. It is a big place and looking after the course is a big job.

'I would hope that whoever buys it will keep the course but it is up to them.

'I would have thought it would appeal to somebody who has a lot of money, who is a keen golfer and who wants to live in a lovely house that used to be owned by a King.

The new owner of Idehill Manor in Devon can also enjoy a game of snooker inside

'There is great kudos in being able to say to friends or business clients "come and have a game on my golf course".'

What you get for £3.95 million if you buy grade 2 listed Idehill Manor:

The golf course extends to 6,117 yards and is a par 73. There are four par threes, 10 par fours, three par fives and a par six.

The owner plays off a handicap of eight strokes over the par but his best score is 79.

One of his favourite holes is the 15th, which has a tall oak tree 100 yards in front of the green and requires an accurate tee shot either side of it.

The property is being sold by Exeter-based estate agents Jackson-Stopps and Staff.

Agent Graham Dixon said: 'It is very rare for a property with its own private golf course to come on the market.

'It is undulating countryside and there are some pretty special views to be had when going round the course.'

It's par for the course that a golf enthusiast is the most likely buyer for Idehill Manor, but prospective owners will have to shell out a wedge of cash to get their name on the deeds
