A Stradivarius violin described as the 'Mona Lisa' of the music world has sold for a record £9.8million at  auction to raise money for victims of the  Japanese earthquake and tsunami.

The pristine instrument was made by the famed craftsman Antonio Stradivari in 1721 and is one of  the two best preserved among his violins.

The 'Lady Blunt' is named after former owner Lady Anne Blunt, granddaughter of the poet Lord Byron.

Record sale: The Lady Blunt violin, made by Stradivarius in 1721, fetched nearly £10m following the online auction

Master craftsmanship: Experts said it was rare to find a Stradivarius in such pristine condition

Previous owner: The violin was named after Lady Anne Blunt, the granddaughter of Lord Byron

The density of the wood used is what's thought to give Stradivarius violins their uniquely sweet sound.

Tests
were carried out on violins made by Stradivarius and another renowned 
Italian violin maker, Guarneri del Gesu, along with eight 'modern' 
violins.

Experts discovered
that variations in wood growth density, determined by tree growth 
cycles, were considerably larger in the modern violins.

Early
growth wood, produced during spring, is more porous and less dense than
late growth wood which provides more structural support rather than 
transporting water.

The 
early and late growth wood in the modern instruments had noticeable 
different densities not present in the older instruments.

Experts concluded that wood treatments used by the Italian craftsment may have contributed to the instruments' sound.

It was bought by an  anonymous bidder in an  internet auction in London on Monday.

It sold for almost £4million more than was paid for it in 2008.

Stradivari made violins, violas and cellos in Cremona, Italy.

Some 600 are still in existence.

The Lady Blunt violin has survived, like the Messiah Stradivarius of 1716, in near-original condition. 

Jason Price, director of Tarisio, the online auction house that sold the violin, said: 'Fine instruments appreciate in value just like fine works of art.

'The Lady Blunt is the most significant violin that a collector can buy.

'In the world of stringed instruments, it is the equivalent of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa or Michelangelo's David.'

The Nippon Music Foundation, which sold the violin, donated the proceeds to victims of the Japanese disaster.

Kazuko Shiomi, president of the Foundation, said: 'While this violin was very important to our collection, the needs of our fellow Japanese people ... have proven that we all need to help, in any way we can.'
