They have long been a nightmare for pregnant women and yo-yo dieters.

And now experts say that soaring numbers of men are suffering from the curse of stretch marks.

New research shows almost a third of all customers buying anti-stretch mark products are men - with the rise in men trying to get buff in the gym largely to blame.

He's got the X Factor: Soaring numbers of men are suffering from stretch marks as they try quick-fix gym plans to emulate Hollywood stars such as Hugh Jackman, who bulked up for his role as Wolverine in X-Men

There has been a growing move by men - 
inspired by the likes of Hollywood actors such as Hugh Jackman - to look
more masculine and beefy by pumping iron, with fitness magazines advocating 'quick bulk up' workouts to get speedy results.

Now sales data analysed by pharmacists at ChemistDirect has revealed that over the last 12 months, 30 per cent of customers buying products aimed at reducing stretch marks are men - up by 10 per cent on the previous year.

The pharmacy says it has received an increase in calls from  men asking about stretch marks because they have bulked over a short space of time.

The biggest demand was in London, followed by Birmingham and Leicester, with an average age of 36.

Stretch marks, also known as striae, are reddish or purplish fine lines that are caused by the overstretching of skin.

The
skin has three layers - the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis - and 
stretch marks are created when there is excessive stretching of the 
middle layer of skin over a short period of time.

Arm envy: Men trying to emulate Hugh by working out are most likely to get stretch marks under the arms, where their upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect

They
commonly occur during pregnancy, or as a result of rapid weight gain or
weight loss, muscle building, or due to growth spurts during puberty.

ChemistDirect pharmacist Omar El-Gohary said: 'It’s common knowledge that women often suffer from stretch 
marks during pregnancy, but it’s less well known that men can also be 
affected when they start working out.

'The most susceptible area for men to 
get stretch marks when they work out is under the arms, where their 
upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect.

'This is because when working out, these areas tend to expand 
more in proportion to the rest of the body. The more pumped up the 
muscles become, the more the skin stretches.'

He added: 'Although
women could get stretch marks from working out, they tend to prefer to 
tone areas, as opposed bulking up their muscles quickly.

'When trying to lose fat or gain muscle,
the key is to do it gradually - any more than one or two pounds per 
week, could stretch the skin too quickly, so it’s essential 
to keep the skin well moisturised before and after working out.

'It’s important to keep a close eye on
key areas such as biceps and to treat stretch marks as early as 
possible - once they turn silver, they are far more difficult to treat.'

But alongside this move towards buffer bodies, men are also more comfortable in admitting they use products to combat stretch marks.

Demand has risen for products such as Dermaoil, Bio Oil, and Palmers Cocoa Butter to help counter the side effects of stretch marks, according to the sales figures. 

Pharmacists recommend regularly moisturising with products, which contain Vitamins A and E, as they play an important role in healing the skin.

They also recommend products such as Dermaoil, which contains Collageneer.

This is derived from lupin seeds and promotes the synthesis of collagen, which can help to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of stretch marks.
