A man who allegedly shot and sexually assaulted a teenage couple in a Texas park in 2012 was arrested on Friday.

David Strickland, 27, allegedly committed the 'heinous assault' against the teens in Portland on June 23, 2012, the United States Marshals Service Lone Star Task Force (LTSF) said in a statement.

The
 bodies of Mollie Olgin, 19, and Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, were 
discovered by a couple in Violet Andrews Park, Portland
 police said at the time.

Olgin was found dead at the scene. Chapa lived, but suffered a brain injury.

Authorities arrested Strickland on Friday, the LSFTF said.

The LSFTF said it worked with the Texas Rangers and the two agencies discovered Strickland 'hiding out' in a Helotes apartment.

'Task force officers and rangers conducted a brief surveillance and approached the apartment,' LSFTF said. 'Task force officers and rangers entered the apartment, identified themselves, and made contact with Strickland. Strickland was then taken into custody without incident.'

Strickland faces capital murder, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated assault with a weapon  charges, the agency said.

Also arrested on Friday was his wife Laura Strickland, 23, Portland police said in a release published to their Facebook page. She allegedly tampered with evidence.

'We are confident that we have the person responsible for this horrific crime in custody,' Portland police said. 'There is still a lot to do in order to prepare the case for prosecution. The families involved will never be the same, but it is our hope that the Olgin and Chapa families will at least feel some form of closure on this chapter of life.'
