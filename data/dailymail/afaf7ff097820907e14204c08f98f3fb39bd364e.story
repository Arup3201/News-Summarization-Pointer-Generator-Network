Australia Post confirmed it will axe 900 senior management and administrative staff over the next year.

Managerial, administrative and support staff will bear the brunt of redundancies with most of the job losses to come from the postal service's head office in Melbourne.

Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour on Tuesday said the cuts, while regrettable, were necessary for the postal service to remain sustainable with fewer letters and more parcels being delivered.

Major losses: Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour announced on Tuesday that 900 jobs will be cut within the week

The savings from the job cuts will be less than the cost of its new services which include extended trading hours and Saturday deliveries.

'By making these changes now, we can minimise the impact for our people, our broader workforce, our business and the community,' Mr Fahour said in a statement on Tuesday.

The company is still working out job cuts in other states but says it will be 'small'.

Retail workers and posties will not be affected.

It plans to merge its retail and delivery businesses under the Australia Post brand while its parcel and express services businesses will fall under the StarTrack banner.

Unions were told of the job cuts concurrently with staff on Tuesday.

The majority of the cuts announced will be from Melbourne, however redundancies across the country are expected to be announced shortly

The Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU) called on the company to come clean about its long-term plans.

It wants Australia Post to give workers the opportunity to retrain or be redeployed to other divisions.

'It is a time of great uncertainty for workers, with job losses set to hit families and their budgets hard,' CEPU NSW state secretary Jim Metcher said in a statement.

Australia Post's failing letter delivery service has been flagged as one of the main reasons for the enormous cuts.

'Australia Post has made it very clear that it is confronting dramatic change due to the impact of declining revenues in our letters service,' an Australia Post spokeswoman told MailOnline.

'Our Managing Director and CEO Ahmed Fahour has publicly stated that the losses in letters business have already overwhelmed the profits in parcels and without reform, the letters services will lose over $1 billion annually in a few years.'

The spokeswoman added: 'Australia Post is already responding and is a much leaner organisation than it was three years ago.

'Part of the modernisation of Australia Post involves shifting resources and investing in areas in response to customer needs, such as recent announcements around the extension of Express Post services and parcel delivery to Saturdays and extended weekend trading hours.'

The news that the service will axe 900 jobs in the next few days, is in bitter contrast to Mr Fahour's current pay packet.

Despite working for a public utility, he was paid a whopping $4.8 million in 2013.

His earnings were higher than the bosses of some of Australia's biggest companies, including Woolworths, Woodside Petroleum, David Jones and JB Hi-Fi.
