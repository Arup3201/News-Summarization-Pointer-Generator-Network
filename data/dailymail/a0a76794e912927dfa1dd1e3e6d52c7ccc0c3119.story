A Florida couple have come forward to claim their half of a Mega Millions jackpot of $414 million, the third-largest prize in the game's history.

The Florida Lottery announced on Tuesday that Raymond Moyer and Robyn Collier had claimed their $207 million prize.

A one-time, lump-sum payment of nearly $115.5 million was made to the Cobie and Seamus Trust, which the couple have setup.

Moyer and Collier won the March 18 draw with a winning Quick Pick ticket from Publix on South Courtenay Parkway on Merritt Island.

‘We didn’t know we had won until the next morning when the numbers were on the news,’ said Collier.

‘I paused the TV and ran to get the ticket to double check the numbers and when I realized they all matched I jumped off the couch in excitement and told Raymond we had won.’

‘I didn’t believe her until I saw the store where we purchased the ticket on the news,’ said Moyer.

‘It was definitely a shock, but it is an incredible blessing that will allow us to do many things we would not have had the opportunity to do before.’

The couple said they plan on investing, traveling and going to as many Notre Dame football games as they can.

Moyer and Collier split the jackpot with another winner in Maryland, who has not yet claimed their prize. Publix receive a $100,000 bonus commission for selling the ticket.

Mega Millions changed its rules in October to help increase jackpots. The game is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
