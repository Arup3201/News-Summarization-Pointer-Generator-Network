'Sorry, I’m just leaning across you momentarily,' a well-spoken young man says to my wife as he stretches to collect her side plate.

We are taken by his turn of phrase and bedside manner. Come to think of it, the girl who showed us to our room had the same sort of polite confidence and plummy inflection.

Then there are the paintings of hunting scenes, the tartan carpeting up the stairs and on the landings, the framed hand-written letters. It makes us think that this can only be a toff enterprise staffed by the proprietor’s godchildren and their gap-year friends.

A slice of English tradition: The Crown is a classic country pub in a pretty Suffolk pub

To further our inquiries, we ask the leaning-across-you-momentarily waiter for some background.

He explains that the Bildeston Crown in Suffolk, about six miles from Lavenham, is owned by James Buckle, who lives in the manor house. He bought the Grade II-listed pub first, and then the building next door, and has turned it into an exemplary restaurant and bar with 12 rooms upstairs.

It is a higgledy-piggledy building that stoops precariously over the pavement, with a courtyard at the back, where a few tables are laid for dinner.

Our room has plenty of exposed beams, a pretty French boudoir bed, a spacious bathroom.

There is a note saying that tea or coffee is available 24 hours a day at no extra cost. Just press zero on the telephone.

There is a formal restaurant called Ingrams, but because of a recent change of chef, it is not in operation. Instead, we eat in the brasserie, where we are given three tiny freshly-baked rolls and a tub of unsalted butter. We devour them instantly.

The menu offers gastropub staples: chicken Caesar, posh fish and chips, Red Poll rib eye, Chateaubriand. I’m torn between the chicken Kiev and Crown burger, eventually opting for the former, but it’s the burger that turns up.

Warm welcome: The pub offers a red-brick interior with exposed beams and leather chairs

The waitress is mortified, but I’m quietly pleased she’s made a mistake - and would have been even more so if the burger hadn’t been quite so rubbery.

Towards the end of dinner, we establish that our erudite waiter is only 18. He seems like a proper grown-up to me - but then, this is a grown-up sort of operation.

He is not around at breakfast in the morning. In fact, it’s all very quiet, except for some dreadful and entirely unnecessary muzak. The low-ceiling dining room does not feel as inviting as it did the night before, so we ask if the doors to the courtyard can be opened to let in some fresh air.

Before leaving, we wander up the high street. Bildeston is a proper working village, with a couple of shops and a post office. The Crown used to be the place where farm labourers and domestic servants were hired. Today, it’s back in business offering sure-footed service with the help of some friendly, articulate staff who can be forgiven for some lapses in concentration.
