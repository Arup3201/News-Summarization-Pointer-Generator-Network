They may not have had an aristocratic start in life but these abandoned puppies are hoping to move up in the world now they are named after the stars of Downton Abbey.

The nine lurcher puppies were named after the characters of the ITV1 drama by rescue staff in the hope it would help them find new homes.

The litter were discovered abandoned and crying in a cardboard box in a park in Southampton, Hampshire.

They were discovered by a woman as she walked her own dogs and she took the puppies to the nearby Blue Cross rehoming centre.

Laura Boyle, rehoming supervisor, said: 'Everyone seems to be talking about the
new series so the team decided to name them after some of the cast.

'We hope they will be just as popular with potential new families when they go up for rehoming.'

Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, who play the Earl and Countess of Grantham, are represented by dogs Earl and Cora.

Other characters include Jim Carter's Carson, Laura Carmichael's Edith, Allen Leech's Tom and Sophie McShera's Daisy.

Ed Speelers' Jimmy, Matt Milne's Alfred and Shirley MacLaine, who plays Martha Levinson, are also represented.

Ms Boyle said: 'We don't know how long they had been abandoned for but they were all very hungry and thirsty.

'She brought them to us where we gave them all a good check-up and they seem to be in good health.

'After a tasty meal they felt much better and are typical bright and bouncy pups.'

However, it is unlikely the litter will be adopted by their more famous namesakes.

The cast of the award-winning programme were banned from bringing their dogs to work by the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon.

The couple live in Highclere Castle, where the show is filmed, but took action after dogs were running riot around the house and grounds.

They own three spaniels and two labradors of their own and their pets were reportedly traumatised by the additional dogs.
