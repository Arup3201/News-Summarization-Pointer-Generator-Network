Americans are moving more than any other region on Earth.

An astonishing 24 percent of Americans say they moved domestically between cities in the U.S. within the last five years according to a new Gallup poll.

The latest figures taken from adults across the country easily names it one of the most mobile in the world while collectively North America had more than any other region.

Domestic migrants: Among 381 million adults who migrated within their countries worldwide within the last five years the United States' population was one of the most mobile in the world

Similar geographic contenders for the title by region are Australia and New Zealand which together reported roughly 18 percent of total internal migrants within the same time.

On its own New Zealand reported an astounding 26 percent of internal migrants while Finland saw 23 percent and Norway 22 percent.

Countries with the lowest mobility trends included China in Developing Asia, which reported less than 5 percent of its population.

'Migration is often associated with the search for better educational opportunities, and across most regions, adults with higher education are more likely to be internal migrants,' Gallup explains.

'Worldwide, those with at least a college education are more than twice as likely (13%) to say they moved internally in the past five years as those with primary education or less (5%).'

They argue of there being no evidence of an education effect in regions such as the Commonwealth of Independent States which had six percent of internal migrants.

Among age groups, younger adults made up the greatest number of internal migrants which world-wide equated to 381 million adults.

Worldwide, 10 percent of adults between 15 and 29 years of age reported moving within their country. After the age of 50 that number was only 5 percent.

The study reports having surveyed 236,865 adults in 139 countries with those countries said to represent more than 97 percent of the world's adult population, 'enabling a reliable global estimate,' according to Gallup.
