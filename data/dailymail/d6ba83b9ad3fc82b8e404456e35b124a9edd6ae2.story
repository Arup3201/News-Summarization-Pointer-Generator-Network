Lewis Hamilton says it 'felt amazing' to be part of a team that helped Mercedes to their first ever constructors' title.

The 29-year-old Briton won the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi and was followed by team-mate and championship rival Nico Rosberg to take the crown away from Red Bull.

And Hamilton, after being presented with his race trophy by Russian President Vladamir Putin, says he was proud to contribute.

'It's history, so we're proud to be a part of it. It's amazing, it's a beautiful day,' Hamilton, in his second year with Mercedes, said.

And after crossing the line he said over the radio: 'Congratulations to the team on winning the constructors' championship. Great job man! History in the making!'

Rosberg made a mistake on the first lap of the inaugural Grand Prix to all but hand his team-mate the race win, but admitted he had to be happy with the end result. 

'Half of me is extremely disappointed, but I'm also really really happy because everyone in the team deserves it so much. 

'It's their most important title, so I can smile a bit.'
