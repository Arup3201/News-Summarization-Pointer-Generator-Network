It is every little girl's dream to go to Disneyland, or so this well intentioned mother thought.

But when she told her daughters they were going on a surprise trip to see Mickey Mouse and co, the stunned, silent reaction of one of her children did not give that impression.

When fun-loving parent Katie Clem, 33, from Salt Lake City, Utah, decided to treat her kids with a spontaneous trip to the famous theme park, she filmed what she thought would be moment of double joy.

But her shock holiday news was met with a hilarious deadpan glare by Chloe, 2, who seemed less than enthusiastic about the idea.

But her optimistic giggles turn to tears of joy when her mommy tells the pair: 'You want to ditch school? Okay, let's ditch school and go to Disneyland'.

While hysterical Lily repeatedly asks her mom: 'Are you serious?!' her deadpan younger sister simply fires a look as if to question whether her mother has lost her mind.

Squinting with one eye, suspicious Chloe doesn't say a word to the announcement, instead, she simply looks warily into the camera as if she has just been given some bad news.

Speaking of her daughter's reactions, Katie said they were a perfect representation of her daughter's different characters.

Speaking to Good Morning America, she said: 'That is so funny to me, because that’s what Chloe does, a little stink face'.

'She’s staring at Lily like, ‘What is your problem?’

'It wasn’t a big deal to me at the time, but to see the reaction of people liking Chloe’s response is pretty funny.

'Lily has always been like that since she was Chloe’s age. She’s very emotional, wears her heart on her sleeve.

'But Chloe is my little danger kid. She’s just like, ‘Yeah, whatever.’ I don’t even have any words for it.”

The hilarious video has since been viewed over 300,000 times on YouTube.
