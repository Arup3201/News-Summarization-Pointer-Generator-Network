The humble cask wine is celebrating a milestone, turning the ripe old age of 50 this year.

Fondly known as boxed wine, bag-in-box, goon bag or goon sack, this South Australian invention has come a long way. 

Despite the innovative design, which is certainly quite prominent on our drinking culture, Aussies have also made a fundamental contribution to society for its rather radical ideas and inventions over the years.

Just to name a few, they include the first ever notepad, ultrasound, bionic ear, pacemaker, plastic banknotes and Wi Fi. Of course, there's also our iconic Vegemite and Hills Hoist clothesline.

The humble cask wine is celebrating a milestone, turning the ripe old age of 50 this year

This woman appears to be playing a round of 'Goon of Fortune' by pegging the bag of wine on a Hills Hoist clothesline - which was also invented by an Aussie

The invention of cask wine began when winemaker Thomas Angove of Renmark, northeast of Adelaide, designed a plastic bladder as an alternative for the traditional wine bottle. The bag is placed in a box and wine is poured through an air-tight valve.

Son John Angove, who's now the managing director of Angove Family Winemakers, watched his father's invention come to life when it was patented on April 20, 1965.

He told the ABC the idea evolved from his father talking about creating the sack in old goat skins to a plastic bag.

'He put the plastic bag inside a cardboard box and it just grew from that,' he said.

'It was a pretty amazing idea and I remember as a youngster thinking: 'god Dad that's crazy, that'll never work, who's going to buy wine in a plastic bag?".'

The invention has gained a lot of love over the years - also helping to Aussies to further develop drinking game 'Goon of Fortune', which involves pegging the bag of wine on a clothesline. 

And when the liquid goods have been consumed, it is then often reused as a makeshift pillow.

CSIRO scientists were also behind the development of the method of Wi Fi in 1992

A popular choice of sun protection for beachgoers, zinc cream which is sun block made from zinc oxide developed by the Fauldings Pharmaceutical Company in 1940

In 1902, the first notepad was made by Launceston stationer J.A. Birchall. It was a lightbulb moment as he cut sheets of paper in half and used cardboard on the back then glued them together at the top

In 1961 the ultrasound scanner was developed by David Robinson and George Kossoff at the Australian Department of Health

One of Australia's other well-known invention is Vegemite, the iconic spread founded in 1922 by Dr Cyril P. Callister in Melbourne.

The clapperboard, also known as a slate used in film-making, was invented by film director and producer Frank Thring Sr of Melbourne's Efftee Studios in 1930.

Then comes the popular choice of sun protection for Aussie beachgoers - zinc cream - which is sun block made from zinc oxide, developed by the Fauldings Pharmaceutical Company in 1940.

Also the Hills Hoist clothesline was developed by Lance Hill in 1945 - although it is said the design was originally patented by Gilbert Toyne of Adelaide in 1926. 

In 1906, the world's first feature film - The Story of Kelly and the Gang - was shown

The Australian feature film was written and directed by Charles Tait

The list goes on as they are plenty more inventions proudly made Down Under.

In 1902, the first notepad was made by Launceston stationer J.A. Birchall. It was a lightbulb moment as he cut sheets of paper in half and used cardboard on the back, then glued them together at the top.

Four years later, in 1906, the world's first feature film - The Story of Kelly and the Gang - was shown. It was just over an hour long.

Then there's the paddle boat surf skis which were first invented by brothers Harry and Jack McLaren of Port Macquarie, north of Sydney, in 1912.

In 1926 Dr Mark Lidwill made an impromptu pacemaker at Sydney's Crown Street Women's Hospital and in 1961 the ultrasound scanner was developed by David Robinson and George Kossoff at the Australian Department of Health.

The baby safety capsule was established in 1984 while the ploymer bank note was created by CSIRO scientists in 1988.

The buffalo fly traps were also established by CSIRO in 1991, a low-tech plastic tent which traps flies when they are brushed off cattle as they walk through.

The CSIRO scientists then developed the method behind Wi Fi in 1992.

Some smaller household goods invented by Aussies include the splayd, a combination of a knife, fork and spoon, by William McArthur in 1943 and more recently the heg, a clothes peg with a hook developed by Scott Boocock in 2012.

Of course, there are more which may ring a bell such as the power board in 1972 by Peter Talbot who worked for Kambrook, the bionic ear created by Dr Gaeme Clark of the University of Melbourne in 1979 and spray on skin in 1992 developed by Dr Fiona Wood at Royal Perth Hospital.
