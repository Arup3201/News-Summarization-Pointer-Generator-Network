An eight-year-old girl has been forced to move schools after a dog that alerts others to signs of her epileptic seizures was banned from the classroom.

Kellsey McGuire has to have her dog Jasper with her at all times to help the pair bond and to help warn others of her potentially-lethal seizures.

However, Kellsey's mother Brandi says complaints by a member of staff at Sherrard Grade School in Illinois have forced the family to move their daughter to Jordan Catholic, a private school.

Kellsey was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 18 months and can have up to 90 potentially fatal seizures a day

The family say Gerrard Grade School should have to pay the new fees as they forced Kellsey to move, while denying her access to her service dog under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Speaking to KWQC, Brandi said: 'It's very important that Jasper's there. He's her furry little angel. He's the one who comes and tells us if she's having a seizure.'

The family are now suing Sherrard Grade School, who refused to comment on the issue.

Kellsey was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 18 months old, and according to her mother, has suffered up to 90 seizures in a single day.

Her seizures can be difficult for other 
to spot, and usually involve her staring off into middle distance and 
smacking her lips, after which she gets very tired.

Kellsey's seizures can be difficult to spot as they usually only involve staring into middle distance and smacking her lips. However, they can cause her to turn blue and have to be rushed to hospital

Kellsey has been taking Jasper to class since January, but on three occasions was told not to bring him. Kellsey's mother, Brandi, says she plans to sue the school

Sherrard Grade School has refused to comment on the reasons behind banning the dog from classes

In order to help strangers spot the signs of danger, and to keep Kellsey safe at night when her parents are asleep, the family applied for a seizure dog in 2011.

Eventually they were given Jasper, who has been going into school with Kellsey since January, but on three separate occasions a member of school staff has complained.

Made to feel harassed and unwelcome, they took the decision to move Kellsey to another school.

Ms. McGuire added: 'If there is anxiety and stress, she can have three to five seizures a week. It wasn't a safe place to be for my daughter.'
