A woman in Florida has launched a campaign to get a stretch of Jacksonville Beach’s coastline designated as a nudist zone.

Angela Anderson, 19, started the petition for the naked sunbathing zone on campaigning website Change.org.

In the 
petition, Ms Anderson appeals to Jackson Beach Mayor Charlie Latham to 
designate around one quarter of the U.S. city's coastline as 
‘clothing optional’.

Making waves: Jacksonville Beach boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and Ms Anderson wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers

The online petition needs 2,500 signatures and has so far attracted over 1,700.

On Change.org's website, Ms Anderson writes: ‘The practice of nudism is purposely nonsexual. It serves as a personal comfort and a stronger sense of freedom.

'There is the belief that nudism helps with self-esteem, relaxation, and overall well-being.’

Jacksonville Beach city boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and Ms Anderson wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers, leaving over three miles as ‘clothing required’.

Daring to bare: Haulover Beach is the only beach in Florida where nude sunbathing is officially allowed

‘In this we give way for everyone to go to the beach however they choose', she explains.

'As many will want to go to a clothing-required beach, they will definitely have the choice within more than 3.1 miles of land, not to mention Neptune Beach and other surrounding beaches as well; and for those who recommend clothing optional, they may now have the option also.’

Haulover Beach is currently the only 
beach in Florida where nude sunbathing is officially allowed but 
sunbathers dare to bare on several other beaches in the Sunshine State, including Apollo 
Beach, Playalinda Beach and Hobe Sound beach.

Ms Anderson now plans to hold a naked photo shoot to publicise her petition and says she will post the images on a Facebook page dedicated to the campaign called The Nudement.

But she said she has struggled to find somewhere she could carry out the shoot legally.

She told WJCT News: ‘It’s out of the way a little bit because it was hard to find someone with a big enough yard and on private land.'

But Mr Latham dismissed the idea in an interview with News4jax.com: ‘Quite frankly, it's contrary to the objectives of creating a family-friendly Jacksonville Beach.

‘My recommendation to anyone who would do that is to find some private property somewhere where you can do that.’

He referred to the fact that there were several topless and nude beaches in Europe and said that American sailors looked forward to visiting them.

But when they got there they discovered not models but members of the general public, aged from six to 60, which he said was 'not quite as pleasant as you might think'.
