Recording video is about to get worryingly easy - with a new pair of techno-glasses that record video and stills, but look like ordinary specs.

Google's much-hyped Project Glass goggles - modelled by CEO Larry Page yesterday - are bulky and distinctly dorky.

Vergence Labs product is stylish - styled after Clark Kent, its makers say - and 'stealthy', as the video-recording specs look just like ordinary glasses.

Le geek, c'est chic? The glasses are designed to record video and stills for easy sharing on social network sites such as Facebook

The prototype: Other tech companies such as Epson are also making ventures into the field, with glasses that display the Android operating system

The prototypes were all made using a 3D printer.

The makers, Vergence Labs, are currently seeking funding for the techno-glasses, which pack a lens and recording equipment into the arms.

Other tech companies such as Epson are also making ventures into the field, with glasses that display the Android operating system.

'Recording video or taking pictures is clunky.  You have to pull out your smart phone or your video camera, and hold it up,' says Vergence.

'What if you could just touch a button on your eyewear and start recording from the actual perspective of your eyes instead? Sure, there are products you can strap on your head, but what if the ability was inside a regular pair of stylish & trendy looking hipster glasses? That would be cool!'

The company hopes the video glasses will be a cult hit on Facebook and YouTube, where point-of-view videos will be a unique way for users to 'capture the moment'.

The glasses will also have a 'magic' button that will turn them into sunglasses

The company's slogan is 'reach out and touch' - hoping that 'point of view' videos taken by the glasses will allow users to use their hands normally

Vergence Labs has rented a Silicon Valley office formerly owned by Google - and has already raised more than $22,000 of its goal of $50,000 start up funding.

We are working with-in an accelerated startup environment to reinvent the human-computer experience as stylish computing enabled eyewear,' says the company.

The frame styles will be modelled after James Dean, Buddy Holly, Clark Kent styles - true geek chic.
