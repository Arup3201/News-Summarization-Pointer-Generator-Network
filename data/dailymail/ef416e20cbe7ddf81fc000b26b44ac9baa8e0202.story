Frank Field said Labour needs 'big ideas' to grab the peoples' attention

Labour are considering raising an ‘NHS tax’ if they win power to plug a £30billion black hole in funding for hospitals and elderly care.

Influential former minister Frank Field has put forward the idea of a 1 per cent rise in National Insurance contributions to make the NHS sustainable.

The health service today costs £95billion a year but this is expected to soar to around £130billion a year by the year 2020, according to official figures from the House of Commons Library.

Mr Field has argued that without drastic action, the NHS will not be able to provide free care for all. And some Labour supporters are said to be backing the scheme, hoping that it could provide a way to solve the chronic financial problems in the health service without imposing further cuts to local authority budgets. A Labour spokesman has claimed that the proposed rise is not under consideration.

But Mr Field said at the weekend: ‘Labour desperately needs two or three big ideas to capture the imagination and this should be one of them. In no way can we have anything like the NHS that we have now if we are running such a huge deficit every year.

‘We have to think about the second phase of the NHS. It has to be reborn. Otherwise it will be unsustainable in a few years.’

The NHS currently costs £95billion a year to run but this is predicted to rocket to £135billion by 2020

Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, is believed to favour higher inheritance tax as a method of increasing NHS funding

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, is thought to prefer the death taxes plan floated at the last election – which would levy 10 to 15 per cent on people’s estates when they die.

A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the party needed to be ‘open to new thinking’ about the challenges of an ageing society, and stressed that a long-term solution for the NHS had to include social care.
