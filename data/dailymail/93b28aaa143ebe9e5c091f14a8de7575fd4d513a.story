Development: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that plans to build Britain's biggest prison - holding about 2,000 inmates - had been given the green light

Plans to build Britain’s biggest prison – holding about 2,000 inmates – were given the green light yesterday.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed the £250million jail will be built in North Wales, near Wrexham, and expects it to be opened in 2017.

Officials estimate the new jail, the first in North Wales, will save taxpayers £20million a year in lower running costs than traditional Victorian jails.

But anti-prison groups called the new jail a ‘warehouse’, and called for the money to be spent on parenting programmes and treating drug addiction.

Mr Grayling said that as well as providing a ‘massive boost to the Welsh economy’ it would allow inmates from the region to be held nearer to their families.

He said: ‘My priority is to provide enough prison places for those sent there by the courts - and to do so in a way that gives taxpayers the best possible value for money.’

‘This will be the first prison in north Wales and a massive boost to the Welsh economy.

‘It will provide around 1,000 much-needed jobs, great opportunities for local businesses and millions of pounds worth of construction opportunities.'

Britain’s biggest prison by number of inmates is Oakwood in the West Midlands which holds 1605 inmates.

Next in size are Liverpool and Birmingham jails which each hold around 1450. Wandsworth prison in South London has some 1300 places.

But the new prison will be dwarfed by Europe’s largest, Fleury-Mérogis Prison in the outskirts of Paris which can hold 3,800 prisoners.

As well as being cheaper, new prisons can provide more opportunities for rehabilitating offenders with purpose-built workshops and training centres.

But some anti-prison groups criticised the announcement, saying the jail would be a ‘warehouse’, which would put the public at risk. They said the money would be better spent on parenting programmes.

Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance said: ‘Rather than pouring money into a new prison, the public would rather their money was invested in early intervention, such as treatment for the drug or mental health issues that offenders all too frequently experience as well as more parenting programmes.’

Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘This U-turn on pouring cash into a huge unwieldy prison is a titanic waste of money that puts public safety at risk.’
