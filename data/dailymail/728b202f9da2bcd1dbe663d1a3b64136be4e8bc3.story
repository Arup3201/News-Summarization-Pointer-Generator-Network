When Siobhan Fields, 18, from Hamilton was offered a tattoo for her 16th birthday present, she jumped at the chance.

But the teen was left humiliated after the bungling tattooist produced a portrait of Marilyn Monroe that looked more like a blow up doll.

Now Miss Fields, a hairdresser, has finally managed to have the offending inking covered up and said she is 'chuffed' with the results.

Miserable: Siobhan was left devastated after tattooist Dave Stewart bungled her dream Marilyn tattoo

The new design, which was done on her 18th birthday on Wednesday, shows a woman’s face with long hair and roses attached to it.

Although she underwent laser treatment earlier this year following an appearance on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters, the results weren't quite what she wanted and instead, she decided to have a new tattoo. 

'I’m really chuffed with the new tattoo, it looks great,' said a delighted Miss Fields, who had her new inking at the Save Our Souls tattoo parlour in Lanarkshire.

'I made a big mistake by getting the first one done and I’ve definitely learned my lesson. I went for a couple of sessions of laser treatment but it didn’t fully take it away.

'I always knew I was going to get one done as soon as I turned 18 anyway so I just had to be patient and wait.'

Miss Fields was left devastated after being given a botched tattoo by 'conman' Dave Stewart and later reported him to the police.

Speaking about the original inking, she said: 'I looked on the internet for pictures of Marilyn Monroe. 

'Then I found the tattooist on a social media website, I had a look through his work and they all seemed really nice. But I later found out they were someone else’s work.

'I could see that it looked awful, as he was doing it, but I was too scared to say anything. It definitely wasn’t a success, it looks horrible.'

Miss Fields booked the session with Stewart, of Cumbernauld, after being impressed with designs on his Intenze Tattoos page on Facebook.

He was fined £300 for operating a tattoo business without a licence when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court last year.
