A giant drone with the wingspan of a Boeing 757 commercial airliner is set to give the U.S. Navy the edge when it comes to spying.

The Triton drone has completed its ninth flight trial to prove its ability to operate at a range of altitudes, speeds and weights.

The drone could take to the skies in a few years and is designed to fly at high altitudes to provide surveillance and intelligence in realtime.

A fleet of giant military drones called Tritons (pictured) with a wingspan the size of a commercial airliner are set to take to the skies in just a few years after successful tests

Triton boasts a wingspan of 130 feet and a collection of sensors, which gives its operators a 360 degree view that stretches for 2,000 nautical miles.

It has been been developed by the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman, which claims the drone will let reconnaissance specialists monitor targets from a greater height and at a further distance then other drones.

The unmanned aircraft can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships.

Operators will be able to control the craft’s radar and high-resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units.

The company believes the drone could be used to support military missions on the ground around the clock in as early as 2017.

The wing structure of the drone was put through structural strength tests in late August by engineers. They successfully demonstrated the wing is 22 per cent stronger than the U.S. Navy's requirement in their lab (pictured)

Should the drone drift from its programmed flight path because of turbulence, it can get back on course without intervention - a skill which it as demonstrated in a recent test flight.

Triton has been tested in nine flights of over nine hours at altitudes of 50,000 feet in Palmdale, California.

The structural strength of its wings has also been tested in a vast lab as the craft will swoop from high altitudes to get a closer look at targets as part of its missions.

‘A team of engineers found that no failures or unacceptable deformations of the wing occurred when it was subjected to a load at 22 per cent above the Navy's requirement,’ according to a company spokesman.

Mike Mackey, Triton UAS programme director at Northrop Gumman, said: ‘During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification.’

‘The wing’s strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.’

The U.S. Navy has ordered 68 of the MQ-4C Triton drones and they are expected to take to the skies on real missions in 2017.

Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in 
‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according 
to a new roadmap.

Unmanned aircraft carrying strong chemical 
weapons could also be on the horizon, the U.S. Department of Defence 
(DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap.

Current
 drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly, which is 
expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines 
make more decisions themselves, Live Science reported.

The roadmap 
also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched
 from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human 
operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by 
the bots’ on-bard cameras.

Thanks to the unmanned mothership, the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles (463km) the roadmap said.

The
 weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more 
deadly under the plans, as researchers are working on ‘energetic 
nanoparticles’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within 
the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion.

The
 technologies combined are intended to help the U.S. military be ‘more 
effective through greater automation and greater performance,’ the 
report says.
