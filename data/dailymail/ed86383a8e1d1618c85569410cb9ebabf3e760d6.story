Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres has suggested Luis Suarez is struggling to score goals for Barcelona because he is not the main man at the club.

The Uruguay international persuaded the Catalan giants to part with £70million to secure his services last summer after scoring 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool in 2013-14.

But the 28-year-old has failed to replicate his goalscoring exploits for his new club and former Liverpool striker Torres believes it is because he is playing second fiddle to Lionel Messi.

Luis Suarez joined Barcelona in the summer from Liverpool for £70million 

Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season as he won PFA Player of the Year

Fernando Torres says Suarez is less prolific for Barcelona than at Liverpool because he is not the main man

'You have to realise that Luis comes from making 50 goals in a team in which he was the one who made the goals,' Torres told AS.

'At Barca you have to start to subtract that amount because Messi makes 50 a year. That is normal.'

Suarez has scored just two La Liga goals this season and five in all competitions but Torres still believes the striker is fundamental to Barcelona.

'He is fundamental. He is a very good player. Against us in the match in the Calderón, the damage that was done to us was done by him.'
