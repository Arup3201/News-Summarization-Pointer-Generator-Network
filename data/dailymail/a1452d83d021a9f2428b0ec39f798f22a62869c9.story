Englishman Phil Bentham will referee Saturday's 2014 Four Nations Series final in Wellington.

The 43-year-old from Leigh was chosen by a three-man selection panel to control the decider at the Westpac Stadium between New Zealand and Australia.

Organisers caused a stir earlier in the tournament by apparently ditching neutral referees but Bentham got the nod ahead of Australian Gerard Sutton and New Zealander Henry Perenara for the decider.

Phil Bentham took charge of the Super League Grand Final last month, and has been handed another final

Bentham, the man who dismissed Wigan forward Ben Flower after just two minutes of the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford last month, was in charge of the opening game between the Kangaroos and the Kiwis.

Perenara and Bernard Sutton have been appointed as video referees and England's Robert Hicks will be one of the touchjudges.
