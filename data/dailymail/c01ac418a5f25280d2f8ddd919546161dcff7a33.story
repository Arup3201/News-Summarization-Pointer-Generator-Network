A father who was battling a brain tumour at the same time as his young son was fighting a similar condition has died, leaving behind his grieving wife and children.

Peter Gebruers, 42, was given two years to live when doctors said had grade four glioma - a cancerous brain tumour - after he suffered a seizure while driving last April.

Just weeks earlier Mr Gebruers and his wife Lucy, 38, were dealt a devastating blow when doctors said Joshua, seven, had a rare brain condition which puts him at a high risk of having a stroke.

For the next two years, both Mr Gebruers and Joshua underwent radiotherapy treatment, and he also had chemotherapy.

Despite this, Mrs Gebruers, from Solihull, West Midlands, has now revealed her husband - whom she describes as 'a wonderful husband and cherished father' - has lost his battle with the disease.

Peter Gebruers, 42, was battling brain cancer at the same time his son had been diagnosed with a rare brain disorder that put him at an increased risk of having a stroke. His family have now announced that Mr Gebruers has now lost the battle to the disease

In January 2014, Joshua, seven (right) had been diagnosed with a rare brain disorder. Days before he was due to start treatment, Mr Gebruers had a seizure while driving Joshua and his sister Amelia, eight (centre left), home from school

Writing on Facebook, she said: 'It's with the heaviest heart imaginable that I say RIP my wonderful husband.

'Fourteen years to the day that we moved in together he was taken from his loving family and adoring children.

'The best man, the most wonderful partner, local friend and cherished daddy. Thank you for giving me two little hearts to carry you around in because mine will never be the same again.

'I love you Pete Gebruers, and I always will. Thank you for all that we have shared. xxxxxxxxxx'

MailOnline first reported on the family's bitter struggle with cancer in August 2014.

The family had received the devastating news that Joshua had a life-threatening brain condition in January that year.

Doctors said he had Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), a tangle of blood vessels in the brain which puts sufferers at high risk of stroke.

In April, four days after Joshua was due to start his radiotherapy treatment, Mr Gebruers had a seizure in his car while driving Joshua and Amelia, eight, home from school.

Luckily, the children escaped without injury, but Mr Gebruers was admitted to Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, where doctors discovered a cancerous brain tumour.

As he was receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Mr Gebruers was forced to give up his job as a pilot. His wife, Lucy, 38, took on three jobs to support the family. The couple are pictured here on their wedding day

While he remained in hospital, Mrs Gebruers was forced to leave his side to take Joshua for a radiotherapy appointment.

She said: 'I had to leave Pete in intensive care to take Joshua to his treatment.

'My daughter Amelia was struggling as she had seen the seizure.

'I just wanted to cut myself in three to be with all of them.'

Mr Gebruers, who worked as a pilot for Thomson Airlines, was given between 14 months and two years to live.

Both father and son underwent radiotherapy, and Mr Gebruers also had a round of chemotherapy.

Mr Gebruer's cancer meant he lost his pilot's licence and was unable to work, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.

The family had cancelled their critical illness insurance cover years earlier, and so Mrs Gebruer took on three jobs so they could stay in the family home.

Despite the hardship the family was facing, Mrs Gebruer said they still felt 'blessed'.

She said: 'Things could be so much worse.'

'I am exhausted, but you have to do what you have to do. If I can keep us in this house by doing three jobs, I'll do three jobs. If I have to do four, I have to do four.

'I do have my dark times, but you have to seize the moment, make the most of life and that's what we intend to do.

'As soon as your start wallowing in self pity, that's when you start to deteriorate.'

The whole family decided to fundraise for charity, calling themselves 'Team G', and have raise £12,000 to date

Announcing her husband's death, Mrs Gebruers wrote on Facebook: 'I love you Pete Gebruers, and I always will. 'Thank you for giving me two little hearts to carry you around in because mine will never be the same again.'

After her father and brother were diagnosed with brain conditions, eight-year-old Amelia decided she wanted to do something positive.

She organised an auction and raffle at her school to raise money for The Brain Tumour Charity, and wrote a touching letter to businesses around Solihull appealing for help.

'I wanted to do something good to cancel out the sad times we're having,' Amelia said.

The whole family joined in the fundraising efforts, calling themselves 'Team G' and have now raised more than £12,000 for cancer research and other causes.

Mrs Gebruer says they will continue their fundraising efforts in her husband's memory.
