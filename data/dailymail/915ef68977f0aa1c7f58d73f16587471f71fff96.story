Tattoo and piercing services have joined the group of Britain’s fastest growing high street shops as Britons aim to emulate celebrities like David Beckham and Cheryl Cole.

There was a net increase of 89 in the number of tattoo specialists in the UK in 2013, which represents a rise of almost 12 per cent.

Despite being lambasted as ‘tramp stamps’, an increasing number of people from all walks of life are turning to body art, delivering an air of respectability.

The example is being set by everyone from Olympic sporting heroes like Victoria Pendleton to the Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, who has a dolphin on her ankle, and the respected BBC journalist David Dimbleby, who opted for a scorpion on his shoulder.

The numbers have been published as part of a new high street survey which reveals independent entrepreneurs are opening shops at a faster rate than the big chains are putting up the shutters.

Figures published today show that while the big chains closed outlets at the rate of 16 a day in 2013, independent stores opened at a much faster pace of 44 a day.

The biggest increase was seen in mobile phone shops as the smartphone becomes a modern day essential with the total up by 157 in 2013 or some 23.93per cent.

The second biggest rise was for barbers with a rise of 136 outlets, while there was also a net increase of 107 in the number of beauty salons.

Fourth on the expansion list were tattoo and piercing parlours with a net increase of 89, ahead of charity shops, with a rise of 88, and nail salons at 87

The biggest fall was in shops specialising in women’s clothes as chains scale back the number of high street outlets with people increasingly buying fashions and shoes online.

Sports personalities also favour the body artwork. Victoria Pendleton has a tattoo on her arm and David Beckham has tattoos on his arms and chest

The research, conducted by the Local Data Company, found a net fall of 140 in specialist women’s clothes shops, while there was also a fall of 49 in general fashion shops and 48 in shoe shops.

The move to shopping online was also reflected in a drop of 43 in the number of furniture shops.

The figures also found a reduction of 75 in the number of newsagents in 2013 as they struggled to counter competition from the hundreds of convenience stores selling magazines and newspapers opened by the big supermarkets. There was also a fall of 62 in the number of jewellers.

The cost of living squeeze has seen a rise in the success of budget supermarkets, however the research found a net fall of 56 in pound shops and general discount shops.

Pubs continued to struggle in 2013 with a net fall of 44 as people suffering a cost of living squeeze cut back on nights out, while there were also 47 fewer bars.

Michael Weedon, the deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said: ‘Independent tailors, bakers, barbers, grocers, hairdressers, confectioners, coffee bars are on the rise as towns see them replace fashion and shoe shops, jewellers, newsagents and booksellers.

‘As chains cut their links one by one with high streets our towns are showing signs of reverting to older models of economic activity, where they serve the needs of physical customers in physical stores, alter their clothes, style their hair and mend their broken iPhones.

‘The churn is huge, with more than 15,000 independents closing in 2013 - but nearly 16,000 opening their doors for the first time. It is not a fluke. It is consistent.

‘Give an entrepreneur a sniff of an opportunity and a chance of a profit and they will create businesses and fill empty units.’

Matthew Hopkinson, director at the Local Data Company, said: ‘Against all odds Independent retail and leisure businesses have continued to grow in our town centres.

‘The propensity of independents to survive and thrive varies massively by place, as does the churn rate.

‘Clearly the appetite is there and increasingly independents are adjusting to the new challenges of the total retail world  - online and offline - as well as the competition they face from their big ‘chain’ brothers.

'Independents are an important part of every town and are the one thing that drives diversity in what has become a homogenous world.’
