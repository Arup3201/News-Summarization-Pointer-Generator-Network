Cancel your plans to journey through the centre of Earth or, at least, adjust your arrival time at the other side.

Research has found that it would only take a person 38 minutes to make it from one side of the planet to the other - not 42 minutes, as previously calculated.

The hypothetical scenario finds that when the different densities of Earth’s layers are taken into account, the trip is four minutes shorter than predicted.

A student from McGill University in Canada examined the hypothetical scenario of falling through Earth (graphic shown). Originally it was thought the journey from one side to the other. When Earth's density is considered, the new estimate is 38 minutes and 11 seconds

The latest time estimate was calculated by Alexander Klotz, a graduate student of physics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada and published in The American Journal of Astrophysics.

‘This was a bit of a surprise to me,’ Mr Klotz told The Times.

Theoretically speaking, as a person falls through Earth, gravity is constantly changing as they make their way to the middle.

Consequently they would speed up as they approached the centre, and begin to slow down again as they made their way to the other side.

Ignoring drag effects due to the presence of air, it would take exactly the same amount of time to make the journey either side of the core.

Under these conditions, the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side. 

Earth’s density is less than 2,200lbs (1,000kg) per cubic metre at the surface, but 28,700 lbs (13,000kg) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles (6,370km) below.

And 2,200 miles (3,500km) from the centre, about half way, there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core.

Using these numbers it would take 38 minutes 11 seconds to fall through Earth - four minutes and a second quicker than thought.

‘Basically, the way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110 per cent of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero [per cent] at the centre.

The original theory goes like this: If a hole was dug from one point on Earth to the other on the opposite side, it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through.

For example, if a person fell from London to the Antipodes Islands - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take that long to travel the whole way.

Of course, they'd need some sort of tunnel that could survive the intense heat and pressure inside Earth, and their body would also need to be able to survive the conditions. 

Plus handle a top speed of 18,000 mph (29,000 km/h).

As you fall through Earth (interior shown in illustration on the left), gravity is constantly changing as you make your way to the middle. So, you would speed up as you approached the centre (illustrated right), and begin to slow down again as you made your way to the other side

Wish you were here? If you fell from London (left) to the Antipodes Islands (right) - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take 38 minutes and 11 seconds to make the journey

Last week it was announced a new 'superviscous' layer in Earth’s lower mantle had been discovered.

The breakthrough could explain why parts of Earth’s sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles (1,500km) underground.

It could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the Earth’s interior, suggesting it is hotter than previously thought.

The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Utah by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in Earth's interior.

This new layer extends from 410 miles (660km) underground to 930 miles (1,500km).

In the layer, liquids are under such intense pressure that they are extremely stiff - known as superviscosity.

Under these conditions, the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side.

But Mr Klotz said previous calculations did not take into account the densities of Earth’s layers.

For example, research has shown that the planet is much denser at its centre than at the crust, near the surface.

Using seismic data, he found that Earth’s densiity was less than 2,200lbs (1,000kg) per cubic metre at the surface, but 28,700 lbs (13,000kg) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles (6,370km) below.

And 2,200 miles (3,500km) from the centre, about half way, there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core.

Using these new numbers in, Mr Klotz found that the time to fall through Earth was actually 38 minutes and 11 seconds - four minutes and a second quicker than thought.

The same is true if a person was to fall between any two points on Earth.
