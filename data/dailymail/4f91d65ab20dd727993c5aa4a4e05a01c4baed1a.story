Alexander Lebedev punched ex-real estate baron Sergei Polonsky during a television debate in September 2011

Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev says he spurned the chance to flee into exile and avoid a possible five-year sentence.

Mr Lebedev, whose controversial 'hooliganism' trial begins in Moscow tomorrow, was allowed by the judge to visit Britain last week.

The 53-year-old met Prince Charles at the opening of a major art exhibition.

In similar situations, a number of 
opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin have used such trips to 
flee what is seen as rigged justice in their country.

But
after returning to Moscow, Mr Lebedev- whose family own the Independent
titles and the London Evening Standard- said: 'Why would I ruin my 
reputation immediately.

'My task is to stay in Russia, take part in the trial and fight for a merciful verdict.'

Legal experts fear he will become the latest prominent figure to be jailed since Putin returned to the Kremlin.

Mr Lebedev pictured outside court in Moscow earlier this month. He says the case is President Putin's revenge for him criticising the Kremlin and a warning to other rich businessmen

Mr Lebedev is accused of politically inspired hooliganism and assault by punching businessman Sergei Polonsky, 40, on a TV show.

In a separate ongoing case at London's High Court, Mr Lebedev is locked in a battle with US industrial giant General Electric over the sale of seven Airbus aircraft.Â
