Britain was on festive flood watch today as the North West of England was covered in alerts ahead of Christmas Day.

The Environment Agency had 35 flood alerts and four warnings in place this morning, with the Lake District and North Yorkshire the most at-risk areas.

In addition, a Met Office yellow 'be aware' alert for ice is in place for Scotland and the uppermost parts of northern England today and tomorrow.

Snow and wind warnings were also issued for Scotland and the North on Boxing Day and Saturday, and snow for Northern Ireland on Boxing Day.

Two of the EA flood warnings, which are the most serious, were for the River Ouse at Naburn Lock and the River Ure at Roecliffe, both near York.

Making up the total of four were warnings in Keswick, Cumbria, and Pimlico Brook at Clitheroe, Lancashire.

The 35 flood alerts were mainly located in the North West and North East, although there was also a handful in the South and Wales.

The Met Office told MailOnline today’s warmest temperature had already been seen at about 6am in London, at 12C, due to a cold air mass arriving.

Tonight is expected to be as cold as 3C in the South and 2C in the North, with temperatures falling to -3C in Scotland overnight into Christmas Day.

Christmas Day will see temperatures of 5C to 7C in the South, 4C to 6C in the North and 0C in Scotland, before it gets much colder into Boxing Day.

Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘We've got a fairly cold night  into Boxing Day. Northern England will be down to zero and in Scotland we could see -6C.’

He cautioned that a white Christmas was not on the cards, but said some sleet is possible in eastern Scotland and North East England coastal areas.

Tonight, scattered showers are likely to affect coastal Scotland alongside some Irish Sea and North Sea coasts with some tracking further inland.

Some of these may be wintry over high ground - but most other parts of the UK will have a dry and chilly night with lengthy clear spells. 

Many areas will have a dry and chilly Christmas Day with spells of sunshine, although showers will affect North Sea coastal areas and Irish Sea coasts.

Some of these will drift further inland, and most of the showers will fall as rain - but they could turn wintry in places.

Meanwhile, Christmas was looking more wet than white in York yesterday but council chiefs said they were prepared to cope with any flooding.

The Kings Staith and Skeldergate areas of the city centre were beginning to flood after recent heavy rainfall caused the levels of the River Ouse to rise.

The Environment Agency said no major issues were expected in the city, but the council said it was ‘well equipped’ to deal with any problems.

Boxing Day will have a fine and frosty start, before cloud will tend to increase from the west through the day with a freshening southerly wind.

Rain will spread in from the west through the afternoon, falling as snow initially over the Pennines and Scottish hills.

Saturday then looks set to be very unsettled with rain giving way to heavy showers, these potentially wintry in places.

BBC Weather said the warmest place in the UK yesterday was Gravesend, Kent, at 13.7C, while the coldest in the day was 4C at Lentran, Highlands.

The wettest place yesterday was Shap in Cumbria with 1.3in (33mm) of rain, and the sunniest was Kinloss in Moray, Scotland, which had 4.7 hours.

In the US, storms in the South yesterday killed at least four people, damaged homes, businesses and cars, and knocked out power to thousands.

It appears spring is already here, as Mother Nature responds to the mild weather with an early show of flowers.

Daffodils are in full bloom on a grass verge in the North Devon village of Instow, and locals claim they have sprung from bulbs planted a decade ago.

And in the Berkshire village of Inkpen, residents are admiring primroses in bloom and snowdrops poking.

Grandmother Sue Hardy, 62, said: ‘There are several grass banks along the roads where the primroses have emerged - It's incredible.'

And in nearby Kintbury, villagers have reported seeing bumblebees flying along hedgerows and in gardens in the spring-like temperatures.

But wildlife experts are warning the current warm weather could spell disaster for hibernating creatures.

If butterflies and hedgehogs are lured out of their winter quarters by the warmth, they will die in a sudden cold snap if they cannot find a new home.

All quiet on the roads but airports are a different matter

It has been a quiet start to Christmas Eve on the roads and railways, with many workers taking the day off.

Airports were busy though, with flights full with some of the four million people who are heading abroad over the period December 19 to January 3.

Main line trains and Tubes were far less crowded than usual, with the Highways Agency reporting no major hold-ups on England’s motorways and A-roads.

And after weeks of almost daily disruption to morning rush-hour trains, rail delays were restricted to minor ones in East Anglia.

Gatwick Airport in West Sussex presented travellers with a complete contrast to last Christmas Eve, when flooding led to a power outage which caused delays and cancellations.

Passenger Rhiannon Morton tweeted: 'It’s so Christmassy in Gatwick today. Santa, frosty the snowman, a giant snow globe.'

Also impressed was Nicola Keleher, who tweeted: 'Gatwick Airport South Terminal looks super busy today but loving all the entertainment, singers & the amazing polar bear.'

The top winter sun destinations for Britons heading abroad include the Canary Islands, Tunisia and Morocco, while top long-haul destinations include Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Egypt.

British Airways’ schedules include 267 flights on Christmas Day, on which 37,000 turkey dinners will be served. Top BA destinations over the festive period are Dubai, Barbados, New York, Australia and Barcelona.

Ryanair is carrying more than 3.5 million customers between December 20 and January 6 - an increase of 500,000 on the 2013/14 holiday period.

EasyJet has had to cancel some Boxing Day flights due to a strike by French cabin crew. However, none of the affected services depart from or arrive in the UK, with all of them being within France.

Rail travellers are having to contend with disruption caused by a £200 million engineering programme over the holiday period.

Although a lot of the work, being carried out by an army of 11,000 rail engineers, is being done on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, there will be major disruption on the West Coast Main Line due to work at Watford in Hertfordshire and between Stafford and Crewe.

The West Coast line will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until December 29.

It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains today until December 28.

Also, work at Reading in Berkshire will mean restricted services in and out of Paddington station in London right through to January 5.

A 16-day part-closure of London Bridge station for work involving the £6.5 billion Thameslink programme started last Saturday.

From December 20 to January 4, Southern and Thameslink trains are not calling at London Bridge.

The other piece of work that will extend beyond Boxing Day is at a spot just outside King’s Cross in London. This will restrict services on December 27 and 28.

National Express has announced record demand for its coaches this Christmas, with this Saturday the most popular day to travel.

Another bus company, First Bus, said it would be running a record number of services on Boxing Day when it would be carrying around 250,000 passengers.
