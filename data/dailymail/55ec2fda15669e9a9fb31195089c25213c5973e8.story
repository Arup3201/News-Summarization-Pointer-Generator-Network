Fraser Hobday, pictured, asked his sister to post his entire career and life story online - right from his early days at primary school.

A footballer playing for a team languishing at the bottom of a Scottish semi-professional league scored an own goal - by giving himself a Wikipedia entry almost as big as a Premier League star.

Cafe worker Fraser Hobday who plays in goal for lowly Huntly FC who are currently bottom of their division with a goal difference of minus 33.

But despite his modest achievements the 19-year-old asked his sister to post a rundown of his career and life story online - right from his early days at primary school.

The trainee chef's 3,271-word biography tells how he failed to keep any clean sheets at his first senior club.

He then describes how he faced the pressure of a penalty in his first big game for Huntly FC, who play in the Scottish Highland League - and let in the goal.

The career of Joe Hart, the Manchester City and England goalkeeper, who has won two Premier League title is described on Wikipedia in 200 words less.

Mr Hobday's entry charts his involvement in the Dunnottar Primary School team 'from its establishment in 2005'.

'He was picked at the first time of asking, when the school held trials for Primaries 5, 6 and 7,' it says. 

The entry charts the time he won 'most improved player' in the Under 13 category while playing for Stonehaven Youth FC

The entry describes the time he won 'most improved player' in the under 13s category while playing for Stonehaven Youth FC.

Describing one game during his career at Huntly FC, the entry said: 'Around the 30th minute of the game, and already 3-2 down, a sudden rush of blood to the head saw Huntly FC second choice goalkeeper Shaun Barney sent off for violent conduct. 

'The team were forced into making a substitution, sacrificing defensive midfielder Mark Gray, and putting on the young trialist Hobday. 

'His first responsibility was to stop a penalty and the pressure was on. Unfortunately, Hobday didn't save the penalty and Turriff United FC went on to win the game 7-3'.

The action-packed biography went viral and sparked a flood of praise from admirers.

On Twitter @Oddschecker wrote: 'Fraser Hobday, a goalkeeper in the Scottish Highland League, has a longer wiki entry than Neymar!' 

Officials at Huntly FC (@huntlyfc) proudly posted: 'Meet Fraser Hobday: the amateur footballer who has a Wikipedia page worthy of Lionel Messi.'

Mr Hobday's page said that when not performing heroics on the pitch he studies professional cookery at Aberdeen college and works part-time in a local cafe.

Wikipedia has suspended the entry with the message: 'This article is being considered for deletion in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy.'

The footballer said today that his Wikipedia entry page was a serious record of his career and not intended as a joke.

He said: 'First and foremost I take my football career very, very seriously.'It's something I want to make a career of. 

'It's my aspiration and my desire. It's what I want to do.

'So whether that was at Middlefield Wasps or Huntly now, I think it's important to show everything that I've done.

'A lot of professional footballers have these information pages and Wikipedia was what I came across and decided to try for myself rather than Linked-in or a blog.

'It started off as something small and grew into something a bit bigger- it's basically an online CV.

'Fraser, who is a semi-pro, said his sister Heather Morgan, 30, had put the information on Wikipaedia as an 'online CV'.

The Wikipedia entry went viral online with some commenting that it was an entry worthy of Brazilian superstar Neymar (pictured)

He added: 'I gave my sister the information on a Microsoft word document. We knew Wikipedia doesn't allow you to add your own entries so I can't write it.

'So she put it up onto the Wikipedia to do me a bit of a favour really.

'It's been there about a year but it wasn't until pre-season this year that some of the boys on the team spotted it.

'It became a bit of a joke on the bus. They'd say "what's Fraser doing tonight?", "probably updating his Wikipedia page". 

'They thought the detail in it was pretty hilarious.

'Most improved player comes up a lot and I get some stick for it.

'I saw that some people had said that it was a Wiki page worthy of Messi - I mean, that's a great comparison.

'Others I saw mentioned Neymar and even Pele. You couldn't really ask for much better could you?'

Wikipedia has since suspended the page with the message: 'This article is being considered for deletion in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy.'

Mr Hobday said that despite the Wikipedia page being suspended, he will now upload the info onto a blog.

He said: 'I'm looking at ways to keep it going.'I'm working hard, I train four nights a week, I play every game so the experience and the exposure is great.'If this page has helped promote Huntly or the Highland League then that can only good. 

Wikimedia UK, which supports Wikipedia, said: 'Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and as such as guidelines about what content is suitable for inclusion, and what isn't.

'In the case of biographies of living people, one of the key guidelines is what we call notability.

'For a biography to be suitable for inclusion, the subject must be notable within their field.

'There is actually a specific notability criteria for footballers, which states that anyone who has played in a senior international, or played or managed in a fully professional league, would be considered notable.

'While Fraser Hobday's career hasn't yet reached the professional ranks, I hope that one day he makes the step up and his Wikipedia entry can be restored.'
