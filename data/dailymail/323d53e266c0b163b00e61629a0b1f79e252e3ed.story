A tiny pet dog who escaped his fenced-in yard in Texas was found outside a southwest Ohio animal shelter, and its owners have no idea how he traveled more than 1,000 miles in a few days.

The 3-year-old Chihuahua-Dachshund mix (chiweenie) named Corbin dug a hole under a fence in his backyard in Killeen March 25.

He was found Saturday tied to a bench outside the animal shelter in Hamilton, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati.

Little Corbin's big adventure: This Chihuahua-Dachsund mix escaped from a backyard in Killeen, Texas, and somehow ended up in Hamilton, Ohio, 1,000 miles away

Wanted: A surveillance camera outside the Animal Friends Human Society captured this woman leaving Corbin tied to a bench outside in the pouring rain

Powerful message: Corbin's owner Mike Saiz shared his story on Facebook, which sparked an outpouring of support from people offering help

'It sounds like one of those too-good-to-be-true stories,' Corbin's owner, Mike Saiz, told The Cincinnati Enquirer. 'This isn't the first time he dug a hole under the fence.

'One time he was waiting for us on our front porch and the other two times we had to pick him up from the local pound.'

A surveillance camera at the Animal Friends Humane Society in Hamilton caught a woman leaving Corbin at the shelter late Friday night.

Corbin was in good shape, just soaking wet from rain and a little scared, said Kurt Merbs, supervisor of Butler County's dog warden's division.

Authorities are hoping to identify the woman and see if they can get answers about how Corbin ended up in Ohio and at the shelter, Merbs said Wednesday.

The staff located Saiz after finding a microchip on him that contained his owners' information.

'They called my wife and she told me that they found our dog, but she didn't sound happy about it,' Saiz said. 'I asked if he was OK and she told me he was fine. I then asked where the shelter was and she said, "Hamilton â€” not Hamilton, Texas, but Hamilton, Ohio."'

Saiz and the Texas-based news station KCEN shared Corbin's tale on Facebook, which sparked an outpouring of messages from people all across the country offering help.

Eventually, Saiz got in touch with Ohio resident Sherrie Thornton who, in turn, helped him reach out to Mary and Shawn Davis.

The Davis couple are from Killeen, Texas, but they happened to be in Springfield, Ohio, for a funeral, and agreed to take Corbin to his owner.

On Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Davis posted photos of the globe-trotting chiweenie and an update stating that they are on their way to Texas.
