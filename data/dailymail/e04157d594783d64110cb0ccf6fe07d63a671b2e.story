Malcolm Beardon has been jailed for killing his wife

The family of a ‘placid’ 79-year-old man who killed his dementia-suffering wife say they are devastated by the decision to send him to prison.

Malcolm Beardon and his wife Margaret, 78, were childhood sweethearts who married 58 years ago and were ‘devoted and loving’.

However Mrs Beardon’s dementia became so severe that she no longer knew who her husband was.

He cared for her on his own at their home in Wellington, Somerset, for more than ten years ‘without ever complaining’, his family said, insisting that he would look after her ‘in sickness and in health’.

But he finally snapped when his wife turned on him one evening last July, accusing him of stealing from her.

He strangled her, then phoned his daughter and told her: ‘I have killed your mother. I am so sorry. She was going on and on.’

Beardon denied murdering his wife but admitted manslaughter due to loss of control, a plea accepted by the Crown.

Their son begged the judge at Exeter 
Crown Court to free Beardon, telling him: ‘I have lost my mother. I 
don’t want to lose my father too.’

Judge Graham Cottle admitted he faced an ‘agonising sentencing exercise’.

The judge said the retired highways inspector was a man of ‘impeccable character’ and the crime would ‘haunt him to the end of his days’.

He said that to have a partner affected by dementia was ‘both a heartrending spectacle and significant challenge’.

But he added that it was not a mercy killing or an assisted suicide, and that the court must ‘recognise the principle of the sanctity of human life’.

He jailed Beardon for 12 months, of which he is expected to serve six.

Yesterday the family said the sentence was ‘cruel’ and ‘served no purpose.’

The couple’s son John Beardon, 42, said: ‘I cannot see any benefit to society in locking my dad up.

‘He is the most placid man 
imaginable. He was completely devoted to my mother. He cared for her for
ten years and is devastated by what happened.

‘I have no idea how he will manage in prison. He is nearly 80. Obviously we are hugely worried about how he will cope.’

The court heard that in the months before her death Mrs Beardon became increasingly difficult to care for.

She
was ‘unkind, critical and accusatory’ towards her husband, accusing him
of being ‘a dirty old man’ and of stealing her things.

‘Her whole personality changed,’ John Beardon said. ‘She thought my dad was just some stranger looking after her. She had no idea who he was. It was absolutely heartbreaking.’

Despite her behaviour, her husband refused to let anyone else care for her and was ‘too proud’ to accept that he needed help.

‘It must have been hellish for him,’ said Mr Beardon, an IT consultant.

‘But he was very old-fashioned and thought it was his duty to look after her. He insisted he could manage.’

Six weeks before her death, Mrs Beardon was seen by a nurse who said she needed a full psychiatric evaluation.

Tragically, she was still waiting to see a doctor when she died, the family said.

‘If she had been provided with the help she needed, we would not be in this position today,’ her son said.

On the night of her death, Mrs 
Beardon was abusive when her husband asked her to undress for bed. He 
‘flipped’ and strangled her, the court heard.

His
son, who lives with his wife Sally in Taunton, Somerset, said he did 
not blame his father for his mother’s death ‘for a second’.

‘As far as I’m concerned, we didn’t lose our mum that night,’ he said. ‘She had already gone.’

He said that before her illness his mother was a ‘strong character’ who loved spending time with family and friends and ‘would do anything for anyone’.

‘She was a wonderful mother and a really selfless person.

‘She and my father were the sort of married couple that most people want to be like – happy, loving, completely devoted to each other.’

Mr Michael Fitton, QC, defending, said the case was ‘a tragedy for all concerned’. He added: ‘Mr Beardon has killed his best friend, his wife of 58 years at the home they shared for 50 years.

‘Everybody says he was a genuinely loving husband who has lost his lifetime companion.’
