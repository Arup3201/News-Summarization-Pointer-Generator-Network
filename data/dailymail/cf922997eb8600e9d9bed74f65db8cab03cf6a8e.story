British car manufacturer Caterham has taken the wraps off its latest high-performance model - a radical racer with no windscreen.

The Caterham AeroSeven Concept is the first car from the firm to be fitted with driver aids like traction control.

Engineers have given the lightweight sportscar a 2-litre Ford engine developing 237bhp - giving it a 0-62mph time of 'less than four seconds'.

It is the most technologically advanced model in the company’s history, featuring an F1-style suspension and graphical display unit.

The AeroSeven also boasts the new ‘Caterham Engine Management System’, where the driver can adjust the level of traction.

But one thing the two-seat concept goes without is a windscreen with the driver and passenger needing a helmet when they go out for a spin.

The car is automatically set in ‘Race’ mode, giving occupants a hardcore driving experience.However, a steering-wheel mounted button can change it to road mode, creating a more subdued driving feel.

Caterham, which is owned by QPR tycoon Tony Fernandes and a favourite of Simon Cowell, unveiled the concept in Singapore ahead of this week’s Grand Prix.

It is the first of a new range of Caterhams, with the manufacturer also hinting at a future SUV.

Graham Macdonald, managing director of Caterham Cars, said: 'Over the coming years, we will be expanding our range of sports cars as we look to meet the differing needs and desires of potential customers - from the lifestyle customer to the ultimate thrill-seeker.
