The first men to appear in public in the Zumba prostitution case were convicted and fined in court yesterday for paying for sex with a woman who 
allegedly used her dance studio as a brothel.

A total of seven of the 62 men charged in the investigation of Alexis Wright, from Kennebunk, New Hampshire, have now been found guilty of engaging a prostitute. Only three personally showed up in court.

Kenneth Fairbanks, 54, who owns a roofing, siding and construction company and Paul Main, 43, appeared in Biddeford District Court yesterday and pleaded guilty to the charges. They paid $1,000 and $700 fines respectively.

Claude Palmer 
Jr, 47, who specializes in window repair, pleaded no contest but was found guilty by the judge. He paid a $600 fine.

The men were the only three to appear in Main District Court yesterday, the rest had their attorneys file plea deals on their behalf so they would not have to show up

The others who pleaded guilty in the 
high-profile case did so through their attorneys and before their names 
were released by police.

They negotiated plea agreements with prosecutors in November before the criminal complaints were issued.

Initially, 21 men were due to appear in court yesterday, according to the Portland Press Herald.

Nine of these men - some of them 
high-profile - have filed for jury trials and another nine had their 
attorneys file not guilty pleas on their behalf.

Wright, 29, has pleaded not guilty to 106 counts which include promotion of prostitution, engaging in prostitution, invasion of 
privacy, conspiracy, tax offenses and receiving welfare benefits when 
ineligible.

Her alleged business partner Mark Strong also plead not guilty. He has been indicted on 59 misdemeanor charges of promotion of prostitution, violation of privacy and conspiracy to commit those crimes.

Maine's 'Number One Home Builder,' and family values advocate, Donald Fortin, 59, has been charged by police

Invested in the community: Attorney Joseph Lewis, former Portland Planning Board member and Little League coach has also been implicated

As many as half of the 56 men charged to date work or worked in a business associated with home building, planning or construction.

Notable among them is Donald Fortin,
59, owner and founder of Fortin Construction Inc, a company that boasts
of being 'Number one Maine Home Builder for over 20 years,' and advertises itself online as 'A Christian Family Owned Company.'

Indeed Mr Fortin is such a staunch 
advocate of conservative family values. According to state records, he 
donated $1000 to Protect Maine Marriage and organisation set up to
'defend' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from 'gay 
rights activists' and 'radical judges' seeking to 'redefine marriage'.

He also made a donation of $350 to Senator Garrett Mason a conservative opponent of the state's same-sex marriage ballot.

Similarly vocal in his defense of family values is attorney Joe Lewis, identified by Kennebunk Police as one of the men charged with 'engaging a prostitute', and a Portland based lawyer.

Mr Lewis, 49, served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer 2012. In his professional biography he makes great play of his commitment to the community and to his family who are, he says, 'firmly settled in Portland'.

He goes on: 'I can honestly say that of all the wonderful places I've had the chance to live in, Portland, ME is exactly where I want to be.

'I'm heavily invested in the community I served on the Portland Zoning Board of Appeal from 2000-2005. I also served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer, 2012.'

He has coached and umpired for the local little League and volunteered in local schools. When approached by MailOnline Mr Lewis declined to comment.

Speaking to Portland's Morning Sentinel, Ronald Weitzer, a sociologist at George Washington University and expert on prostitution said that the fact that a large number of  Wright's alleged clients were in such related or similar businesses, 'does suggest that there was some referring going on'.

Wright kept meticulous records suggesting a business enterprise that brought in more than $150,000 in 18 months and including a 'Domination Fettish Sheet,' and client list reportedly running to 150 'johns.'

This, along with other materials removed from her Zumba studio has formed the basis for much of the Kennebunk Police investigation.

An honours student who raised money for good causes, none suspected Alexis Wright of living a double life

Speaking to Mail Online last month Lieutenant Antony Bean Burpee admitted that they were a long way from completing their inquiries.

He said: 'We've been investigating since September 2011 and we're nowhere near finished. 

'We have to establish probably cause before we can charge these men and we're working through a long list.'

The investigation was sparked by a tip off from a 'concerned resident' who had grown suspicious of the frequent male visitors to Wright's dance studio and, later, a rented office across the street.

But nobody could possibly have imagined the torrent of allegation and counter-allegation that would follow.

To most of those who knew her to that point Wright was simply 'a fun and energetic' girl, a former honours student from neighbouring Wells who took part in charity drives and class trips with her 7-year-old son.

She hosted Zumba charity events for earthquake victims in Haiti, the Susan G Komen foundation for breast cancer and Toys for Tots.

These are the sort of our-of-hours activities residents of the light-house studded coastline expect of their neighbours.

But if the charges against are prove true she did all this while leading a double life that included acts of prostitution and filming clients.

So far police have released three 
batches of names of men charged with engaging a prostitute. As well as 
the peculiar prevalence of contractors, painters, drywall and concrete specialists,
window and flooring professionals, realtors, appraisers and real estate
attorneys the list has included former Mayor James Soule, 58, realtor 
Gary Bahklow, 57, attorney Jens 
Bergen, 54, financier Joe Cuetara, 63 and local ice hockey coach, Donald
Hill who has since stepped down from his role at Kennebunk High. 

All
of the accused men sought to prevent their names being made a matter of
public record in an application that was last month denied in 
Cumberland County Superior Court by Justice Thomas Warren.

They are not the only men seeking to distance themselves from Alex Wright, the Zumba instrutcor who allegedly employed a number of online aliases to advertise her willingness to 'have fun(Sex) with both men and women'. 

The lawyer acting for Mark Strong, 57, Wright's former business partner and alleged co-conspirator, has applied to have Strong's case heard separately from the dance instructor.

According to Strong's lawyer, Daniel Lilley, this is because Wright faces far more serious felony charges than Strong who has been charged with 59 misdemeanours - all of which he denies.

She has been charged on 106 counts of prositution, invasion of privacy, conspiracy, tax offences and receving welfare benefits when ineligible for welfare.

Mr Lilley said, 'It is guilt by association and we woudl just as soon go this month on our own, by ourselves.'

Mr Lilley is also hoping that his client's trial can be heard before Christmas - an impossiblity for Wright as the police continue to issue summonses, and release names, pushing the trial well into next year.
