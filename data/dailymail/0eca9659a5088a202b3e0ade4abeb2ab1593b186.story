A crackdown on taxpayers’ money being used to fund union work by civil servants is today exposed as a dismal failure.

The cost of ‘facility time’ in Whitehall shot up by almost a third in two years, according to official figures.

What has been dubbed a ‘scandalous subsidy’ increased from £18.3million in 2010/11 to almost £23.6million in 2012/13 - a rise of 29 per cent.

Limits: Fifteen government departments failed to meet a cap set by the Cabinet Office

Fifteen government departments failed to meet the cap set by the Cabinet Office of 0.1 per cent of the wages bill being spent on union time.

Facility time allows trade union representatives to take paid time off to participate in union duties. But critics say it means taxpayers are providing unions with a huge activist base to support strikes and freeing up resources for political campaigns.

Before the curb was introduced in 2010, there was no monitoring of the subsidy among civil servants – with some working full time on union duties and others even receiving promotions without actually doing the job for which they were paid.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who uncovered the figures under freedom of information laws, said: ‘With so many facing the disruption of strikes led by militant union leaders, taxpayers will be alarmed to learn their subsidy to the unions has shot up by almost a third in two years.

'Having pledged to cut the millions of pounds of public money siphoned off for union business, it is vital that the Government delivers on its promise.’

The figures are based on data from 16 Whitehall departments and 37 executive agencies. As 20 departments were sent requests, the estimate is almost certainly below the  actual spend on facility time.

The biggest spenders were the Ministry of Justice, which charged taxpayers almost £6.5million. The Department for Work and Pensions spent £6.1million, while the Ministry of Defence topped £3.3million.

The DWP also saw one of the biggest rises in spending over the two years, with a £5.68million or 1,350 per cent increase. Ministry of Justice expenditure leaped by £726,610 - 13.4 per cent - while spending by the Home Office rose by £646,786 (25.9 per cent).

At present, 0.26 per cent of the Civil Service’s pay bill is spent on union work. The equivalent figure is just 0.04 per cent in the private sector.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group has led calls for a cut in the subsidy, which it claims is actually worth £80million to unions across the entire public sector.

But the National Association of Head Teachers said facility time saves taxpayers’ money by preventing conflicts and tribunals, and promoting training and development.

The Trades Union Congress says the public and private sector save £2million a day. A Cabinet Office spokesman said newer figures will show costs falling ‘dramatically’.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'Before 2010 there was no monitoring of taxpayer-funded union representatives and too many civil servants worked full time on nothing but union work.

'Some civil servants were even promoted without doing the job for which they were employed. That is not fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants.

'Our policy now limits the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work.

'We will be looking closely at this data as it seems totally at odds with the recent numbers reported by departments.

'Because there was no systematic monitoring before the last election, in some cases reported numbers have seemed to increase but what actually happened is that departments more accurately monitored their workforces as a result of our policy.

'Our newest figures, which will be published shortly, show the cost of facility time has fallen dramatically.'
