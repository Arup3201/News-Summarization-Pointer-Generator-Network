A jab of gel may be a new way to treat heart failure, a condition that affects 900,000 people in Britain. 

The substance is injected into the heart wall to improve the organ’s function and reduce symptoms such as breathlessness and swelling in the ankles.

Heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and heart attack.

As a result, the heart is no longer able to pump blood around the body properly. 

To try to increase its pumping power, the heart grows in size.

This works for a while, but eventually the over-worked heart wall starts to stretch, becoming thinner and stiffer. 

The heart develops an abnormal shape and ends up pumping blood even less efficiently.

The condition can also affect the heart’s normal electrical signals, which can result in a dangerous heart rhythm disorder. 

There’s no cure for heart failure, but lifestyle changes — such as cutting down on salt — and medication to reduce blood pressure can help keep symptoms under control.

However, some patients do not respond to these. The hope is that the new gel injections will offer them an effective alternative.

The treatment, called Algisyl-LVR, involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, where the disease tends to start.

The jabs are given by a surgeon through an incision in the chest.

The injections contain a gel-like material that thickens in the heart muscle, strengthening it and restoring its shape. 

This increases the heart’s pumping efficiency and reduces stress on the organ, preventing further damage.

The gel doesn’t harden completely, remaining pliant so it is flexible enough to move with the tissue of the heart wall.

It is being trialled on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide, including in Italy, Germany, Romania, Australia and the Netherlands. 

Early results show the jabs improve the heart’s capacity and reduce symptoms.

The U.S. manufacturer Lone-Star Heart says: ‘It represents a new treatment strategy based on the medically accepted principle that a reduction in muscle tension and cell stress will improve the function of the dilated left ventricle of the heart.’

Dr Christopher Morley, consultant cardiologist at Bradford teaching hospitals NHS Trust, says: ‘This ingenious technique of injecting a gel directly to the left ventricular muscle has a sound physiological basis.

‘Hopefully, it will prove to be effective and safe in patients who otherwise may have a poor prognosis.’
