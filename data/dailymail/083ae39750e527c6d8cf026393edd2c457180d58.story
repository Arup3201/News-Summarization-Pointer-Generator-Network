Mo Farah relived the moment he collapsed unconscious in a bathroom with an illness that left him hospitalised for four days and medical professionals fearing he had a heart problem.

Farah had been for a run at altitude in Park City, Utah when he was overcome by excruciating stomach pain, ultimately resulting in his withdrawal from the Commonwealth Games.

On the eve of the European Championships, where he will race for only the second time since running the London marathon, the 31-year-old explained the dramatic events which led to his Glasgow no-show.

Scare: Mo Farah was forced out of the Commonwealth Games after collapsing in his bathroom

Wednesday (6.50pm) — 10,000m final

Friday (9.15pm) — 5,000m round 1

Sunday (3.30pm) — 5,000m final

‘I had a tooth taken out because it was chipped and it got infected,’ said Farah. ‘I was in a bit of pain, but went for a run anyway, and when I came back I collapsed on the bathroom floor, completely knocked out.

‘I had my phone in my pocket, so when I woke up I called Cam (Levins), my training partner, and he came round and got me on to my bed.

‘I was in so much pain from my stomach. He called an ambulance and it took me to hospital. I then had to be airlifted to the main hospital as they thought something was going on with my heart — it was just crazy.’

Farah claimed he couldn’t bear to watch the Commonwealth Games on TV, particularly the 10,000 metres race in which Levins won bronze. 

Road to recovery: Farah is back to fitness following a 'crazy' illness

‘It was just too painful,’ he said. ‘I saw the results and Cam did really well but I just wasn’t ready.’

Farah missed a block of training due to illness in July, but it was not until the opening morning of competition in Glasgow that he announced he was pulling out of the 10,000m and 5,000m.

Farah hit out at Paula Radcliffe, who said she was ‘surprised (Farah didn’t) give himself a bit more time’ before withdrawing from the 10,000m and instead opted for the ‘much easier’ European Championships.

‘Paula said I’d taken the easy option, which is not fair as she’d seen me struggle,’ said Farah, who is often joined by Radcliffe on training trips.

Speaking out: Paula Radcliffe criticised Farah for his Glasgow no-show

‘I would’ve loved to have come back and continued the road to the Commonwealth Games. I didn’t want to disappoint my fans and all those who had bought tickets, but I was nowhere near ready. I did one track session and Paula was timing me and she told me I should stop.

‘Someone like Paula telling you to stop, you know there is something wrong and I just wasn’t right — she could see that. It took a lot out of me.’

Monday marked two years to the day since Farah won the second of his two gold medals at London 2012. Last year, he did the distance double again at the World Championships in Moscow. He then chose to focus on the London marathon, where he came a disappointing eighth.

Flying the flag: Farah is in bullish mood ahead of the European Championships 

‘This year I need to do something,’ admitted Farah. ‘I thought I’d have done better. In track, you can get ready for 1500, 5,000, 10,000 and you can do a lot of speed but with the marathon it’s just a lot of running, a lot more miles and at the end you are pretty tired.

‘I feel I’m 100 per cent for the Europeans and I need to be. There are a lot of good athletes — Bob Tahri, a few Kenyan guys running for Turkey and a few other good Europeans.’

Farah has spent the last week at training camp in Font Romeu, France where he was visited by British Athletics performance director and sometime physiotherapist Neil Black.

‘I think he’s recovered remarkably well,’ said Black. ‘The only people that should be worried are the people who are going to be on the start line with him.’
