One good turn... will get you a driving ban: Lesley Gillam outside West Suffolk magistrates' court yesterday

A good Samaritan stopped to help an American serviceman who had driven into a ditch - and they have both ended up being banned for drink-driving.

Lesley Gillam, 57, went to help Ryan Hoagland, 21, after he left the road in Kentford, west Suffolk, on the night of December 10, a court heard yesterday.

But they were both breath-tested by police at the scene and found to be about double the drink-drive limit.

Gillam, of Newmarket, had 68 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath and Hoagland had 79mcgs. The limit is 35mcgs.

The pair, who had never met before that day, both appeared separately at West Suffolk magistrates' court in Bury St Edmunds.

Gillam admitted driving with excess alcohol. Michael Whatley, defending her, said she had driven to a friend's house where she intended to stay after a night out.

They had taken a taxi to and from the Apex entertainment centre in Bury, said Mr Whatley.

But Gillam then realised she had left essential medication for her thyroid condition at home and drove to fetch it - 'not realising' she was over the limit.

On her way home she spotted Hoagland's car in the ditch and stopped to offer him a lift.

'Unusual circumstances': At West Suffolk magistrates' court, District Judge David Cooper banned Gillam from driving for the minimum of 12 months

But a taxi driver, who was first at the scene, had already called police. Officers turned up shortly afterwards and breath-tested both drivers.

Mr Whatley said losing her licence would have a 'devastating effect' on Gillam's life. He said she is a self-employed interior designer and totally reliant on her car.

District Judge David Cooper told Gillam: 'You could have just driven by on the other side of the road but you did not.'

U.S. serviceman Ryan Hoagland, who is based at RAF Lakenheath, the home of the USAF's 48th Fighter Wing, also admitted driving with excess alcohol

In view of the 'extremely unusual circumstances' the judge said he was banning her for the minimum of 12 months. Gillam was also ordered to pay a £250 fine and £100 costs.

Hoagland, based at RAF Lakenheath, the home of the USAF's 48th Fighter Wing, also admitted driving with excess alcohol.

The American told the judge: 'I am just grateful that I did not hurt anyone.' Judge Cooper gave Hoagland a 20-month ban, a £250 fine and £100 costs.
