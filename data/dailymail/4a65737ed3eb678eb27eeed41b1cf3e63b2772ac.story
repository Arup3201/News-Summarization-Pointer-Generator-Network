The anti-ageing drink is the best-seller on the Boots website after it became the first in the UK to stock it

It is said to banish wrinkles, has a string of celebrities singing its praises and is available on the high street.

So it is perhaps unsurprising that a collagen drink introduced at Boots last month is already proving to be something of a beauty hit.

The supplement has become the biggest-selling product on the Boots website after the chain became the first in the UK to stock it.

Experts, however, have said it ‘offers no advantage’ over a normal diet. 

The anti-ageing drink, called Pure Gold Collagen, comes in 50ml bottles containing a daily dose of collagen – a protein that gives skin strength and elasticity – along with acids designed to promote the protein’s production.

As it gets older, the body’s reserves of collagen deplete, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles. A Boots spokesman yesterday said that the drink was up to 50 times more effective than collagen creams and pills at replacing the skin’s protein stores.

He said: ‘It not only replaces collagen but gets straight into the blood stream so the effects can last up to two months if you stop using it.’ In clinical trials of 1,500 women aged 35 to 55 who drank it daily, two-thirds reported an ‘up to 30 per cent reduction’ in lines and wrinkles.

A number of celebrities also praised the drink, which costs £35.99 for a ten-day supply. Anthea Turner, 52, said it was ‘one of the most effective skincare products’ she had tried.

The former GMTV presenter  said: ‘I’m 
always a little sceptical of things like this but people have been 
saying “you look well” and to be honest I do.’

Presenter Carol Smillie, 50, added that, after taking the drink for a few weeks, ‘my skin looks and feels more youthful, radiant and hydrated’.

But some experts said the supplement was unlikely to be effective.

Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting said: ‘A collagen drink offers no advantage that I’m aware of over normal dietary protein.

‘Replenishing collagen stores is a complex and finely tuned biological process. You can’t cheat by importing these molecules “whole” from the diet.’

Consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe added that the drinks were ‘interesting’, but said: ‘More research is needed before we can be sure if they result in facial rejuvenation.’
