Residents in western Kansas are being warned to watch their step after a gigantic sinkhole opened up overnight this week in the area, swallowing an entire pasture.

In a shocking development that has left many in the area scratching their heads, the Wallace County Sheriff's officials say the enormous 90-feet-deep chasm measuring 200 across feet has since continued spreading, gobbling up more land.

The freak sinkhole has left many people in the rural area on edge while drawing others to gape at the odd phenomenon north of Sharon Springs.

Freak sinkhole: This massive chasm opened up seemingly overnight near Sharon Springs in western Kansas

Awe-inspiring: The monster pit is 90 feet deep and measures 200 feet across

Growing: Cracks surrounding the sinkhole suggest that it is expanding

Ravenous: The gigantic hole swallowed Dalton Hoss' large pasture

A few days ago, Dalton Hoss first noticed cracks in the ground on his property. A short time later, his meadow was gone, replaced by a gigantic pit in the ground.

‘Actually, my brother found it.  He called me up and his voice was quaking and he said, “You'll never believe what I just saw,"’ Hoss told the station KWCH.

Sheriff Larry Townsend said the void is surrounded by cracks, suggesting that it is getting bigger, and at this time, there is no telling when it will stop expanding.

Mystery: No one knows what caused the ground to open up or when the sinkhole is going to stop expanding

Act of God? There are no oil wells or irrigation wells in the area that could have caused the sinkhole to open up

Local attraction: Visitors have been flocking to the area to take a peek at the awe-inspiring pit

‘Man had nothing to do with this.  This is a God thing,’ the sheriff stated. ‘ There's no oil well around here, there are no irrigation wells anywhere near.  This is something that just happened.’

It remains unknown what caused the ground to open up in the first place, or how to prevent the sinkhole from swallowing more land. Experts are set to visit the site in the coming days to examine the ground.

No injuries have been reported in 
connection to the sinkhole so far, but concerns have been raised that 
people who have been flocking to the site to catch a glimpse of the 
awe-inspiring tourist attraction may be putting themselves in harm's 
way.

Hoss is attempting to prevent curious visitors from approaching the yawning chasm on his land for their safety.

There have been several incidents in recent months involving larger-than-life sinkholes. In July, a chasm in Toledo, Ohio, swallowed a woman's car as she was driving. Luckily, she was able to escape the vehicle alive.

In May, a New Jersey man was killed when the ground opened up beneath the warehouse where he worked.

Earlier this year, a Florida resident perished under similar circumstances when a giant chasm swallowed his home while he was sleeping inside.
