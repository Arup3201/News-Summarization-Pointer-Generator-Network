An injured explorer is in hospital after nearly two weeks trapped a kilometre beneath the mountains of Bavaria.

A multinational rescue operation pulled Johann Westhauser from the Riesending caves, which sink deep into the Alps near the Austrian border, just before noon.

Mr Westhauser had been trapped after he suffered serious head injuries in a rock fall on June 8, leading to a rescue operation involving more than 200 cave rescue specialist.

By early this afternoon, the 52-year-old had 'arrived safe and sound at a hospital,' Bavarian mountain rescue chief Norbert Heiland said.

The final stage of the rescue, which involved hauling Mr Westhauser through a labyrinth of narrow passages and precipitous vertical shafts, began on Friday after several days of preparation.

After a short pause overnight, rescuers resumed work early this morning morning and brought Westhauser the final 590 feet to the surface just before noon.

A fit expert could scale the distance 
from the site of the accident to the entrance in about 12 hours, but 
rescuers had to haul Mr Westhauser on a stretcher through the 
challenging terrain.

The first words Mr Westhauser uttered 
upon seeing Italian rescue workers approach him on Saturday morning 
were: 'I am feeling OK.'

Rescue workers put Mr Westhauser into a police helicopter perched on a tiny landing spot near the entrance to the Riesending cave after the final phase of the transport of the injured spelunker

After
 two days treating him inside the caves, rescuers finally strapped Mr 
Westhauser to a stretcher, to begin the process of carrying him out of the 
network of tunnels.Â 

'We are
 very glad that the patient is able to tolerate the transport so well,' 
doctor Johannes Schiffer said as the rescue was underway.

Mr Westhauser had a heating system and a neck 
brace attached to him in a bid to avoid further brain swelling on his 
journey back to the light.

Some
 German media reported that doctors considered boring into his skull 
while underground to relieve pressure on his brain, but it is unclear 
whether this procedure was actually carried out.

Despite having 
suffered a serious brain injury, certain passages within the caves are 
so narrow that the explorer was expected to get up and walk himself.

Foam, of the type used
 in building to insulate walls, had been sprayed on him to both cushion 
and warm him on his journey.

He was also medicated - tranquilised, in 
effect - to keep him calm in the cold, pitch darkness where progress was expected to be agonisingly slow.

There
 were, for example, five shafts measuring 200 feet each, that he had to 
be pulled up with only a few centimetres between him and the dripping 
rock face.

Mr Westhauser was seriously injured by a falling rock while he was wearing a helmet during the early hours of last Sunday morning.

By the time a paramedic reached his side he was already showing the first signs of hypothermia, as the temperature in the spot where he is lying underground never reaches above 3C.

It could only be reached by crawling through a labyrinth of tiny spaces, rappelling down sheer drops and making difficult climbs in the pitch dark.

Cave rescue specialists from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Croatia  were drafted in as part of the rescue mission.

The giant Riesending complex is under the Untersberg mountain range. According to legend, the Holy Roman Emperor sleeps beneath the mountains and will one day emerge to lead Germany to glory.

The entrance to the caves was only discovered in 1995. Mr Westhauser's expedition had set out to map uncharted areas of the cave and was scheduled to take a month.
