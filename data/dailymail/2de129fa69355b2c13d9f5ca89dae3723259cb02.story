Nick Cannon is reportedly claiming that he walked out in his marriage to Mariah Carey amid concerns for her 'emotional state'.

Cannon recently confirmed reports of trouble in the couple's six-year marriage as he admitted they are no longer living together with sources close to the performer telling TMZ that it was Nick's decision to end their union and he is worried about their three-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe.

According to TMZ: 'Nick has made it clear to all involved ... he's deeply concerned about Mariah's emotional state and is ending the marriage for the well being of their kids. He believes the environment around Mariah is toxic and fears for his kids.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for the stars for comment.

The sources added to the website that Nick is also worried Mariah's handlers are most concerned with her making money and do not care about her well-being.

He is also said to want to create an environment for the twins which is free from the 'chaos' of Maria's life.

Speaking with The Insider on Thursday, Cannon, 33, explained,:'There is trouble in paradise…we have been living in separate houses for a few months.'

After shooting down rumours that cheating caused the break, the star said his three-year-old twins are his 'main focus'.

The next day a representative for the 44-year-old icon told Us Weekly, 'Mariah is focusing on her children and her upcoming tour.'

The beauty's longtime spokesperson prefaced her remark by saying, 'I don't comment on Mariah's personal life.'

Nick and Mariah married in 2008 following a whirlwind two month romance.

They appeared to have a blissfully happy marriage but TMZ recently reported Mariah was furious when Nick revealed a list of five celebrities he had slept with during a very candid interview with Power 106 radio.

Mariah was left feeling 'humiliated' following the interview, which also featured him revealing when he first had sex with his wife.

Sources close to the couple say their marriage started to unravel in March following Nick's interview, when he reflected on his short romance with Kim Kardashian back in 2006.

He claimed he had too many ex-lovers to list them all, saying: 'Are you kidding me this is L.A.? That's the whole purpose of it, you have sex with actresses, singers, models.'

When told he could just name five, the star had his list ready: 'That's easy. OK, Mariah Carey, Christina Milian, Nicole Scherzinger, Selita Ebanks, oh, Kim Kardashian.'

He then elaborated about Kim, now married to rapper Kanye West, saying: 'You just forgot (about her) because there have been a lot of people since me.'

In an interview with another station a week later, he tried to backtrack over his comments and praised his wife's sex skills.

He said: 'She doesn’t even know who Kim Kardashian is. She doesn’t pay attention to that.

'She doesn’t care when I talk about our sex life because our sex life is amazing.'
