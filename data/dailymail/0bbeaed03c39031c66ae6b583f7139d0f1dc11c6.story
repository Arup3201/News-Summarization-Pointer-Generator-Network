England have been forced to put one of their jetlagged late arrivals on standby for Saturday’s first Test against the All Blacks amid fears that Danny Care may become the latest key man to be ruled out.

The Harlequins scrum-half suffered a shoulder injury in training and if he fails a fitness test at Eden Park, Ben Youngs will be promoted to wear the No 9 shirt, with Lee Dickson — who arrived in Auckland on Wednesday — on the bench.

As he announced a weakened line-up with a total of just 299 caps in the starting XV, head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Danny Care is a concern. He fell awkwardly in training on Monday, jarring his shoulder, and I’m giving him until the captain’s run on Friday.

'At the moment we’re hoping he’ll be fine but it’s meant I’ve had to put Lee Dickson on standby and Ben Youngs would start if Danny is out. It’s not ideal, but needs must.’

It certainly isn’t ideal. England will be desperate to avoid losing Care, a stand-out figure during their Six Nations campaign, while Youngs has endured a season of fluctuating form and Northampton’s Dickson may have to play seven days after appearing in his club’s Aviva Premiership final win.

England go into the encounter with the world champions with an exciting but potentially vulnerable 10-12 combination. Freddie Burns will be preferred to Danny Cipriani at fly-half and his inside centre sidekick is Kyle Eastmond — who was out of favour at Bath during the last month of the season.

While Manu Tuilagi will provide significant ballast at outside centre, the All Blacks will no doubt target his midfield team-mates by deploying the rampaging Ma’a Nonu to test their defensive resolve.

Lancaster is adamant that his rookies can withstand the onslaught, saying: ‘They’ll be ready because it’s going to come their way. They’re going to be tested. In our system, Freddie has been good (defensively). We’ve had various back-line combinations in the past and we’ve always been solid. Credit goes to Andy (Farrell) for that. There’s nothing I’ve seen in training that has me lying awake worrying about it.’

Eastmond played both Tests against Argentina last June and impressed the management with his free-spirit exploits. The former St Helens rugby league player has not been selected since but Lancaster said: ‘Having worked with him in Argentina, where he got his first caps, he was exceptional on that tour and every time he’s trained with us we’ve seen huge potential in him. The partnership of him and Manu has been looking promising in training.

Plunged into action: Ben Youngs could play at scrum half if Care fails to make the cut

‘As a midfield partnership it’s nicely balanced. It’s still got that ball-playing 12 that I prefer to have, someone to distribute and make good decisions and it’s got the power runners as well. We need to give Kyle the licence to do what he does best — that’s put people through holes — but also encourage him to take on players himself as he’s a genuine running and passing threat.’

Burns is another creative force when he is on his game, which was not often last season as the saga of his move from Gloucester to Leicester left his confidence in tatters. England need him to regain his strut quickly and Lancaster insisted he has done so, having been told that the absence of George Ford left him on track to start the first Test.

‘That started back in England,’ said the head coach. ‘As soon as the George Ford scenario unfolded the message to Freddie was “I know you’ve been disappointed with your own form but you need to understand that there’s a very good chance you’ll be starting this first Test. You need to get your head round it and make sure you’re going to be on the money if it comes”.

‘If he trained well and put his best foot forward [I told him] he would be starting. He’s taken it with both hands. He’s been excellent. By giving him the notice early it’s allowed him to mentally prepare and as a consequence he has led the team well.’

The coaches have been paying particular attention to enhancing confidence to compensate for the personnel problems. England have able deputies but some are alarmingly short of recent game-time, such as Rob Webber.

Geoff Parling is preferred to Dave Attwood as the lock in charge of the lineout operation, while James Haskell’s superb form for Wasps forced him ahead of Tom Johnson to start at blindside flanker.Further back, Marland Yarde is recalled on the right wing.

‘I think it’s a strong side,’ said Lancaster but he will relish naming a far stronger one next week.
