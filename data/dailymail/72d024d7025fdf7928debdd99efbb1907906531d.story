When the Queen ordered a painstaking replica to be made of Queen Victoria's christening gown for her descendants, even she might not have expected to see it get so many airings.

Today young Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina Windsor, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's first grandchild, became the latest royal baby to wear the Honiton lace robe, last sported by Prince George of Cambridge just two months ago.

Like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Maud was baptised at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace.

Prince George of Cambridge was christened at St James's Palace in October in the same gown - a replica of the one passed down the royal generations from Queen Victoria

But as 42nd in line to the throne, the event was far more low-key, with no senior members of the royal family attending.

She
 was driven into the palace by her adoring parents, Lord Freddie Windsor
 and his wife, Lady Sophie – also known as Peep Show actress Sophie 
Winkleman.

The four-month-old, also wearing an embroidered cream hat tied with ribbons, was carried to the service by her thespian mother.

The
 original royal christening robe, of fine Honiton lace lined with white 
satin, was made in 1841 for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, 
Princess Royal.

The original gown was subsequently worn for all Royal baptisms, including The Queen, her children and her grandchildren.

But
 in 2008 it became clear that the gown was becoming increasingly 
delicate and the Queen commissioned her dresser, Angela Kelly, to make a
 hand-made replica in order to preserve the original.

James,
 Viscount Severn, son of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, was the first 
member of Royal Family to wear this replica gown in April that year.

Since then it is believed to have been used by the Queen’s grandson, Peter Phillips, for the baptisms of both his daughters.

And
 it is likely to be dusted off again next year as his sister, Zara 
Phillips, is due to give birth to her first child in January.

The latest wearer, baby Maud, was born in Los Angles, where the couple currently live, on August 15.

Although she is 42nd in line to the throne, Maud has not been given a title, a decision that dates back almost a century.

Prince and Princess Michael's children are known as Lord and Lady, and not Prince and Princess because when King George V created the House of Windsor in 1917 he ruled that only the sons of a brother of the king would be princes with the title of Royal Highness.

It was also deemed that their children would have the style and title of the sons of non-royal English dukes.

The actress's family were seen entertaining the child as they arrived at the venue with a toy that shares her mother's name - Sophie the Giraffe.

Meanwhile, the baby's proud grandfather Prince Michael of Kent, the Queen's cousin, arrived with his wife and their daughter Lady Gabriella.

The two Windsor woman beamed for the cameras as both had pulled out the stops to look glamorous for the occasion.

Princess Michael of Kent looked much younger than her 68 years in a silver outfit and pill box hat. Her daughter, 32, looked equally stylish wearing an embellished cocktail hat, sparking diamond earrings and a blue dress coat.

Ms Winkleman said she hopes to introduce her daughter to Prince George over Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace.

The prince was born a month earlier than Maud who arrived at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in L.A.

Ms Winkleman, who is based in the U.S. for her acting career, told Hello! magazine that the labour was 'long and hard'.

The 33-year-old said: 'By the end I was begging for a caesarean thinking, I can't do this anymore - but I managed a natural birth with some wonderful doctors and midwives along with Freddie in the room with me, who were just stunningly brilliant, saying, "You can do this!". Their dynamic, American positivity carried me through.'

She said of her financial 
analyst husband being present at the birth: 'He was very brave, because 
it wasn't delicate or pretty and I was horrid to him. He read me a crossword clue in the middle of it and I just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head.'

Explaining their choice of name, Lord Freddie, 34, said: ‘We liked the idea of an old-fashioned English name and there are a couple of Princess Mauds in my father's family from a hundred years ago - one was the youngest daughter of Edward VII who ended up being Queen of Norway, and another was a granddaughter of Edward VII by his daughter Princess Louise.

'It's also a beautiful, elegant name and it was always our first choice. Elizabeth is a tribute to the Queen, Daphne is Sophie's grandmother, who she was very close to and Marina is my paternal grandmother.'

Speaking about his granddaughter, who is 42nd in line to the throne, Prince Michael said after her birth: 'We are absolutely thrilled by the arrival of our beautiful first granddaughter, Maud. We are both besotted with her. Not only does she have the prettiest blue eyes and adorable tiny feet, but she is also remarkably well-behaved.'
