Ashley Dupre, the call girl most famous for bedding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, is on the verge of giving birth to her first child - if these pictures of her huge baby bump are anything to go by.

A very-pregnant Dupre was photographed on Thursday in Red Bank, New Jersey. She is believed to be due any day now.

The 27-year-old revealed in August she is set to wed long time love, Thomas 'TJ' Earle, now that he is 
divorced from the wife he cheated on with Ms Dupre only months after the
'Love Guv' scandal broke.

The high life: Ashley Dupre, the former call girl who became world famous for her tryst with Eliot Spitzer, announced she was engaged and pregnant in August

Dupre's affair with Spitzer - who became known as 'Client No 9' - led him to resign after just 14 months in office.

A
stint as a relationship advice columnist for the New York Post and a 
spread in Playboy followed the scandal for the mother-to-be. She 
recently opened a lingerie and swimwear store in Redbank.

Rumors have been circulating since Femme by Ashley customers started noticing the large 'rock' on Ms Dupre's finger and her obviously swollen stomach this summer, but details of the wedding plans and sex of the baby are being kept a secret.

Asked about her pregnancy, Ms Dupre told the New York Post in August: 'So far so good!'

She and Mr Earle began an illicit affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom he has two children.

After meeting at a Jersey Shore restaurant, Mr Earle had reportedly boasted to a friend, 'I could have had her for free.'

When
their steamy affair was exposed later, the Earle Companies executive 
publicly apologized to his wife calling his actions a 'grave mistake'.

Ms Dupre meanwhile, went on to make a 
name for herself, this time as a New York Post agony aunt, fielding 
questions from readers on sex and relationships and being commended by 
many for her bravery in speaking out about her experience.

In
a final piece for the column, to which she contributed for two-and-a-half
years, she said: 'I'm proud to say that Ask Ashley has been a greater 
success then I ever thought.

'Not a financial one, but rather a success in letting people see that I'm more than just the girl in the headlines from 2008.'

When
Mr Spitzer was accused of paying Ms Dupre $2,000 for sex at a Washington
hotel the night before Valentine's Day in 2008, a can of worms was 
opened that revealed the governor's long time penchant for expensive 
call girls and culminated in his resignation.

Scandal number two: Ms Dupre set the rumour mill spinning again in 2008 when she was spotted getting out of a car in New York City with then married Thomas Earle (pictured above) to whom she is now engaged

Now making headlines for all the right reasons, Ms Dupre says she's 'matured' and has 'moved on' from the scandal.

According to Mr Earle's lawyer, Mitchell Ansell, his client and ex-wife Alisa have been divorced for over a year and are on good terms.

He confirmed: 'They divorced amicably. She has moved on, and he has moved on. There’s nothing scandalous. No one's running around. [Ashley] is pregnant, and [TJ and Ashley] are planning on getting married.'

'Everyone is looking forward to the future,' Ms Dupre told the Post.
