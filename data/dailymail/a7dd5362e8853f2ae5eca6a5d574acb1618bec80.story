Even if you were not thrilled with one of your presents yesterday, it might be worth sending a thank you letter anyway.

Those who take the trouble to put pen to paper stand to get something much better next year, according to research. 

More than 80 per cent of gift givers say they will spend an extra £20 next Christmas on friends and relatives who send them a note.

But more than half of Britons say they would reduce the amount they spend on a loved one by £10 if they didn't get a written thank you. 

Some 20 per cent polled in a survey by Royal Mail and etiquette experts Debrett's said it would put them off giving that person a Christmas present ever again.

There is also a time limit after which patience wears thin, with 60 per cent saying a note sent after a fortnight is too late.

Almost two-thirds of parents will ask their children to write thank you letters for gifts this year.

Debrett's etiquette adviser Jo Bryant said: 'In our digital age, a handwritten letter is always appreciated. 

'Letters of thanks should arrive by the first few days of January.'
