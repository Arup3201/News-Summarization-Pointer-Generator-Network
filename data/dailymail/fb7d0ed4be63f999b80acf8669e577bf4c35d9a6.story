Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez fired Barcelona to the top of La Liga by scoring five of their six goals at the Nou Camp on Sunday.

Suarez scored the first and last goals in the 6-1 win. 'He is giving us more and more with every week that passes’ said Luis Enrique.

Messi scored a 12-minute second-half hat-trick to take him level with Cristiano Ronaldo for 30 league goals this season. It was also a record breaking 24th La Liga hat-trick taking him one clear of the Portuguese and setting a new domestic record.

Rayo Vallecano are more used to lunchtime kick-offs than Barcelona but Suarez had no problems with the early start as he put the home side ahead after just six minutes.

He received the ball from Xavi having sprung Rayo’s adventurous offside trap and, with the outside of his right boot, spun a shot past the advancing Cristian Alvarez. It was one of his best goals since joining the club, and it was also his ninth since the turn of the year.

Barcelona should then have wrapped up the three points in the next 20 minutes but were wasteful in front of goal and unfortunate with a penalty decision that went against them. 

First Suarez was sent racing away once again as Rayo persisted with a suicidal high defensive line but his cross to Pedro was cut out by a recovering defender.

The former Liverpool striker then went through on Alvarez but was bundled down from behind by Abdoulaye Ba only for the referee to wave play on. Pedro was next to go close went put through by Messi but his effort was saved by Alvarez who was helping to keep Rayo in the game. 

He was also spending a lot of time sweeping up outside his area. The visiting manager Paco Jemez had said before the game that losing by seven would be the same as losing by a single goal and his attacking tactics were keeping him to his word.

Rayo had their chances too. Trashorras in particular tested Claudio Bravo from open play and from a free-kick after Javier Mascherano had fouled on the edge of the area and been booked for his trouble.

Barcelona could not extend their lead before the break but they came close just before the half time whistle with what would have been one of the goals of the season. 

Suarez lofted a pass over the top of Rayo’s defensive line to Messi and flicked it first time over the goalkeeper but just wide of the target.

If Jemez spent the break convincing his players they get back into the game the belief was undone within five minutes of the restart. Xavi took a corner, Jordi Alba headed it on to a post and when it came back down in the six-yard box Pique forced it over the line.

Rayo were 3-0 down, and a man down, before the hour mark. Full-back Tito had been booked in the first half and when he grappled Suarez to ground inside the area the referee pointed to the spot and pulled out a second yellow and then the red.

It was Messi’s first spot-kick since having his penalty saved by Joe Hart at the Etihad. He seemed to wait an age before steering it to the keeper’s right and seeing it comfortably saved. There was a let-off to come however with the referee deciding it needed to be taken again.

At the second attempt he put it to the keeper’s left and this time the ball  nestled in the corner. The roof was coming down on Rayo now and Messi soon made it 4-0 turning in a Suarez pass. Alvarez then saved the Barcelona number ten’s free-kick to deny him a hat-trick. He wasn’t denied for long however.

On minute 63 substitute Rafinha sent the ball out to Alba and he crossed for Messi to quick-step around the last defender and convert for his third goal of the game, his 30th of the season and his 24th La Liga hat-trick –no one has ever scored more.

Alves was sent off for bringing down Alberto Bueno. He looked to get the ball before the player but the referee pointed to the spot and the former Real Madrid youngster scored the penalty.

There was still time for Suarez to get his second of the game. He raced clear of Rayo’s still stubbornly high line but played in Messi instead of finishing himself and watched as the pass just run away from his team-mate. Messi repaid the favour when he slipped Suarez through and with seconds of normal time remaining he made it six.
