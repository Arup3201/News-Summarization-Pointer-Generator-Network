A Muslim cable channel has been dropped by Verizon a year after the owner of the station was given life in prison for beheading his wife at their TV studio.

Bridges TV will go off air on March 14, almost a year to the day after the channel's owner Muzzammil Hassan, 47, was jailed for the brutal murder of his wife Aasiya, who was also the station manager.

Mrs Hassan had told her abusive husband that she was leaving him in 2009 and asked for a divorce.

Six days later he lured her to their office in Buffalo, New York where he stabbed her 40 times and hacked off her head with two hunting knives.

The couple had two children Danyal, nine and seven-year-old Rania.

Hassan, a former banker, was convicted of second-degree murder in 2011 for stabbing and beheading his 37-year-old wife. He received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life in jail.

The Verizon network claimed that dropping the channel was unrelated to the brutal murder, putting the decision down to low viewership figures.Â 

Samantha Azzar, news anchor at Bridges TV told wgrz.com: 'Without Verizon, we will cease to exist.

'There will be no voice for local Muslim Americans to cover stories that are important to them.'

The station has posted a notice on its website asking supporters to complain to Verizon about getting rid of Bridges TV.

Muzzammil Hassan started the station in 2004 and lists as one of its values to 'thrive on innovation and originality, encouraging risk-taking and divergent voices'.

A judge recently issued a settlement that the Hassan's two children, as well as Muzzammil Hassan's two older children, will receive millions of shares in Bridges TV.
