Hundreds of Jamaican prisoners are to stay in British jails at a cost of £27m a year after their government turned down a deal for them to be returned.

The Ministry of Justice has been trying to persuade successive Jamaican governments to allow up to 737 prisoners to be returned to the island to serve sentences for crimes committed in the UK.

A voluntary agreement to allow prisoner transfers was signed in 2007 but seven years later it has still not been ratified by the Jamaican parliament.

Jamaicans make up the third largest number of foreign nationals in UK jails, after Polish and Irish, and they will be allowed to stay after their government rejected a new compulsory transfer agreement

And now a proposed compulsory deal to send the prisoners home has been rejected after the Jamaican government claimed it would be unconstitutional.

The embarrassing snub is a further blow to British taxpayers, who already pay £400 million a year for the imprisonment of 10,600 foreigners from 157 countries.

Conservative MP Philip Hollobone expressed anger at the attitude of the Jamaican Government and told the Times: ‘Given they are a Commonwealth country and they have the third highest number of foreign nationals in UK prisons, it ought to be a priority of the British Government to negotiate such an agreement as soon as possible.’

And previous attempts on the part of both Labour and the Coalition to transfer foreign prisoners have proved fruitless – because the prisoners have to consent to the move and can refuse on the grounds of human rights.

David Cameron previously said UK taxpayers should fund foreign jails to enure that prisoners can be deported

Under the current voluntary deals, both countries, as well as the prisoner, must consent to the transfer, and there are fears that even with a compulsory deal prisoners can claim that being sent home will be a breach to their right to a family life.

Jamaicans make up the third largest proportion of nationalities in our prisons, after Polish and Irish inmates, and an EU deal, which is expected to allow the compulsory transfer of hundreds of EU citizens when it comes into force this year, has exemptions for states with the highest number of people in jails.

Irish prisoners will not routinely be considered for transfer because of the close links between the two countries, and Poland, which tops the list, has been given an opt-out until next year to ensure that its prisons can cope

Last year David Cameron announced UK taxpayers were to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as Nigeria and Jamaica, because no prisoners would choose to go to a foreign prison where conditions are worse than in British ones.

At the time he said: ‘When people are sent to prison in the UK we should do everything we can to make sure that if they’re foreign nationals, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison.’

He added: ‘We should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries. Even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home.’

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers should not have to pay for what amounts to a bribe to boot out criminals who should not be here.’

It was found in 2012 that one in eight prisoners – 11,000 inmates - are clogging up our jails.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told the Times: ‘We are currently providing Jamaica with advice on prison reform with a view to returning to discussions on this matter.’
