Canada has banned a string of iconic British foods including Marmite, Ovaltine, Bovril, Lucozade and Penguin bars, it has been claimed.

Government inspectors reportedly swept products off the shelves of a specialist food shop after telling its owner they contained unapproved ingredients.

The ban came to light after Tony Badger, who owns three expat shops including Brit Foods in  Saskatoon, central Canada, had his Christmas shipment 
impounded by customs officers.

Ban: Love it or hate it, Brits will apparently have to do without Marmite in Canada thanks to food laws

Smear: In a letter to a shop owner, authorities said Marmite contained 'enriched vitamins and minerals'

He then received a letter from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) saying the products contained unapproved ingredients - before officials removed them completely last week.

Mr Badger said he had been selling several of the products since he opened his first shop in 1997 with no complaints.

‘We’ve been bringing Irn-Bru in since the very beginning,' he added. 'My understanding was we were importing legally.

‘We’ve been declaring it through a customs broker and we’ve never had an issue until now.

'The concern now is, with the 
next shipment, if it gets held there may be new issues with new 
products, so it somewhat paralyses our ability to bring new product in.'

Illegal: Irn-Bru also made the list for containing the red food colouring Ponceau 4R (file photo)

One customer, Brian Smith, said he regularly visited to the shop for Ovaltine and Royal Game soup - both of which were removed.

He said: 'I can feel for Tony on this because I think it's unfair that he's been in business since 1997 and now they're all of a sudden stopping it.

'It's good enough for the U.K., it should be good enough for Canada.'

In a letter to Mr Badger, CFIA said Irn-Bru from Britain contained the red food colouring Ponceau 4R, which is not on its approved list of food additives.

Marmite, Ovaltine, Lucozade, Penguin Bars and Bovril, meanwhile, ‘are enriched with vitamins and minerals’ and therefore illegal.

Other products like canned soup and stock contained too much animal product, according to the body.

Mr Badger said he had heard CFIA was conducting a health-risk assessment to see whether the ruling could be overturned.

Iconic: Marmite is a British staple, but it is one of several foods banned in a letter to a Canadian shop owner

He said: 'When this health-risk assessment is done we should know definitively whether you can import Irn-Bru.'

A spokesman for A.G. Barr, which makes Irn-Bru, said the company produces a Canada-specific product in a specially-labelled 500ml plastic bottle which does not contain Ponceau 4R, and has been exporting via a local distributor for more than 15 years.

It is the only Irn Bru product A.G. Barr exports to Canada, according to the spokesman.

But Mr Badger said to his knowledge, all British specialty shops in Canada were selling the British recipe.

Canada is home to one of the largest populations of Scottish expats.

The CFIA has yet to comment.

Irn-Bru maker A.G. Barr’s website said the company was working to replace the food colouring to bring it in line with guidelines set by the UK’s Food Standards Agency. However, the company assured the public the colouring is safe.
