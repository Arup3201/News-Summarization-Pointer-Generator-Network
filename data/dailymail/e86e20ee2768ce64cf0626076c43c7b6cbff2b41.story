Senator Ted Cruz has his healthcare paid through his high-flying wife's private plan at Goldman Sachs, it has been revealed.

Cruz of Texas has gained national notoriety with his crusade to deny funding to Obamacare.

His wife Heidi Nelson Cruz, who has worked in the firm’s Houston management division for eight years, told The New York Times in an interview: ‘Ted is on my healthcare plan.’

In September Cruz was asked by Sen Dick Dubin about where he gets his healthcare coverage.

'Will the senator from Texas for the record tell us now -- and those who watched this debate -- whether he is protected and his family’s protected?' Durbin asked.

Cruz, who drove the two-week government shutdown earlier
this month, deflected thee discussion toward an uninsured diabetic woman that
Duvin had been talking about earlier. 

Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the senator, confirmed the coverage, which Goldman said was worth at least $20,000 a year.

'The senator is on his wife’s plan, which comes at no cost to the taxpayer and reflects a personal decision about what works best for their family,' she said.

'Ted is very much a visionary,' Heidi Cruz Nelson told the Times.

'He is very strategic, and he’s very practical, and he does what needs to be done, not what everybody wants him to do.'

Cruz’s high profile has raised speculation that he’s planning a 2016 White House run and when when asked if she could envision herself as first lady, the senator’s wife coyly replied: 'Um, I don’t think I should answer that.'

Meanwhile law enforcement officials are investigating threats made via Twitter against Cruz.

The Canadian-born Tea Party conservative is widely believed to have been a major force behind the recent government shutdown.

The threats were made on Twitter by a person with the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54.

Online rant: Senator Ted Cruz has been the subject of Twitter vitriol

The man, identified as Troy Gilmore Jr, posted on Twitter Friday morning: 'Take down Ted Cruz, at his home' and listed Cruz’s home address in Houston, Texas.

'Lets Find Ted Cruz, Texas address and show up his House, drag him out and B***h slap his A** in front of the country,' another tweet reads.

'Ted Cruz, we want you a** go the f*** back in Canada, else you and ur family will pay. U got a f***ing big mouth,' the same person wrote.

Later he wrote that Cruz 'needs tobe [sic] taught a street wise [sic] lesson'.

It appears that after the threats were made, Gilmore changed his Twitter handle to @KingKong, but he kept the diatribe up and referenced his previous tweets.

He denied threatening Ted Cruz and urged his 49 followers to get Republicans out of Washington 'on a rail.'

Troy Gilmore Jr has also been active on Facebook where he has published Cruz's address and numerous rants against the Republican party stemming from the government shutdown.

'We’re aware of it and have alerted the proper authorities. I can’t comment further on security matters,' Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton told The Hill.

According to The Hill, the threats weren't so much a call to action, since @ArmyVet54 did not have any Twitter followers.

However, @KingKing now has 49.The man behind the handle identifies as an Army veteran, father of three and native of New Jersey who now lives in Florida.

Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus told The Hill the department is 'looking into that matter' and that they take all threats against members of Congress seriously.
