A group of astrophysicists from The University of Texas at Arlington suggests a habitable Earth-like planet could exist in a distant solar system found by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope.

Kepler-16 has two stars, like Star Wars’ fictional Tatooine. Kepler-16 System made headlines in September when researchers discovered Kepler-16b, a cold, gaseous planet orbiting both stars.

The UT Arlington team, have concluded that an Earth-type planet could exist in the system’s ‘habitable zone’ – as a moon orbiting Kepler-16b.

To host life in that zone, a terrestrial planet orbiting the two stars 
would need to have high levels of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere 
such as carbon monoxide or methane, they said.

UT Arlington Department of Physics professor Zdzislaw Musielak said, 
‘This is an assessment of the possibilities. We’re telling them where a 
planet has to be in the system to be habitable. We’re hoping they will 
look there.’

‘There is less light from the star, so the planet itself has to maintain
more heat,’ said PhD student Billy Quarles, one of the co-authors on 
the paper.

Science fiction: The notion of a planet wth two suns may seem familiar - because Luke Skywalker lived on one in Star Wars

Kepler's
mission is to scour our section of the Milky Way galaxy for Earth-like 
planets in the so-called 'habitable zone' that is not too close and not 
too far away from the stars they orbit.

The spacecraft does this by finding stars
whose light periodically gets dimmer, which means there is a planet 
passing between the star and Kepler's instruments. This is known as a 
planetary transit.

If the 
notion of a planet with two suns was displayed in the earliest Star Wars
film on the fictional planet Tatooine, home of Luke Skywalker.

Tatooine was a rocky, desert planet, but Kepler-16b is a cool gas giant, Boss and other researchers said.

Kepler-16b is similar to Saturn in 
size and mass, a cold gas giant that orbits its two suns every 229 days 
at a distance of 65 million miles (104.6 million km).
