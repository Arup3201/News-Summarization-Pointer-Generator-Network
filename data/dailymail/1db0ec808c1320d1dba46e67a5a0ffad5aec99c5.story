We might think of quirky fruit beers made in small, independent breweries as a modern trend.

But in fact the practice goes back 9,000 years when high-ranking cavemen drank brews which included fruit and strange ingredients such as pine resin.

Unlike in modern times, alcohol was considered to be sacred and was used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests.

Hold the glasses: Alcohol was considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests. Fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines, mead and beer made with barley and oats, much like the pints we consume today (pictured)

Alcoholic residues suggest that ancient Eurasians drank fruity wines, beer made from barley and wheat and mead.

They also consumed fermented drinks made from dairy products.

The making of alcohol seems to originate in China in around 7,000BC.

People living in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran were drinking wine made with pine resin in 5,000BC.

Scientists have discovered a professional winery in south-eastern Armenia dating from 4,000BC.

Experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby.

Dr Guerra-Doce thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region.

Fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines and beer.

Elisa Guerra-Doce, a prehistory expert at the University of Valladolid in Spain told Live Science that the archaeological record of prehistoric Europe shows that people used mind-altering substances.

As well as historical accounts by ancient Greek writers, archaeologists have found macrofossil remains with mind-altering properties and some designs in tombs could have been inspired by altered states of consciousness.

Dr Guerra-Doce looked at macrofossil remains of psychoactive plants, residue from fermented alcoholic drinks, chemical compounds left on skeletons and artwork showing drinking scenes in a bid to piece together how alcohol and drugs were used in Eurasian prehistory.

While the making of alcohol seems to originate in China in around 7,000BC, 2,000 years later, people living in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran were drinking wine made with pine resin.

And scientists have discovered a professional winery in south-eastern Armenia dating from 4,000BC.

Experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby.

Some pottery fragments contained residues of beer and wine from burial sites and settlements.

High ranking people in ancient Eurasia occasionally drank to excess.  Alcohol and drugs were considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests. Here, a figurine known as the 'Poppy Goddess' (centre) is thought to have been used in the taking of opium

Dr Guerra-Doce said: ‘Many tombs have provided traces of alcoholic drinks and drugs. I think these substances were used to aid in communication with the spirit world.’

Some artworks, such as a figurine known as the ‘Poppy Goddess’ show that drugs were also used ceremonially.

The figurine was found in a chamber in Crete thought to have been used by cult members. She has three moveable hairpins shaped like poppy capsules, which hint at how opium might have been extracted by people.

Her serene expression suggests the trance-like state ancient people may have entered into by inhaling opium fumes.

Dr Guerra-Doce thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region.

‘The main evidence to support that idea is the archaeological contexts where they have been found: tombs of high-status individuals and restricted ceremonial places,’ she said.

‘I think that prior to a large-scale production, alcoholic drinks were reserved for special events and they played a similar role as drug plants.’

But as larger scale wineries and breweries became more common, alcohol found its way into the hands of average people, who largely used it for hedonistic rather than ritualistic purposes.

The consumption of alcohol was linked to funerary ceremonies, not fun
