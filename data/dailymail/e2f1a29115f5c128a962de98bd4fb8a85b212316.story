A wealthy car collector has sold a classic Ferrari at auction for a record-breaking £8.4 million - a 13 fold increase on its value 20 years ago.

The 1953 Ferrari 375MM Berlinetta is regarded as one of the most sought after classic models in the world.

Sir Paul Vestey's stunning example has the rare accolade of being raced by F1 champions Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Mike Hawthorn.

Classic: A wealthy car collector sold this Ferrari at auction for a record-breaking £8.4million

The multi-millionaire bought the Ferrari 375MM from JCB magnate Sir Anthony Bamford in 2004 for an undisclosed figure.

He sold it at RM Auctions' prestigious Villa Erba sale in Italy over the Bank Holiday weekend for £8.4 million.

This is a 13 fold increase on its price 20 years ago, when it was sold in the US for $987,000.

It makes it the most expensive car sold at auction this year and a world record for a Ferrari coupe.

In 2011 the 1957 Farrari 250 Testa Rossa became the most expensive Farrari ever sold smashing the previous record by more than $4million. The car, affectionately known worldwide as the '666' because of its serial number, sold for $16,390 in California. 

Another beauty came in the form of the 1936 Mercedez-Benz 540k Special Roadster. Only 26 were ever made. One sold for $11,770,000 in August 2012. 

The 1960 Ferrari 250 GT Californa LWB Competizione Spyder was similar to the Testa Rossa. One sold in 2011 for a cool $11,250,000. 

The 1968 Ford GT40. Best known for winning Le Mans 24 hour race four times in a row. It sold for in California for $11million. 

The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider was sold for $10 894 900 back in 2008, by radio DJ Chris Evans. The car was once owned by James Colburn, the Hollywood actor, and had only been expected to fetch $3.5m until a bidding war erupted. Celebrities are known for their lavish purchases, but nobody can blame Evans for splashing out on this 280bhp beauty.

The car's staggering value - it could 
pay for 50 'average' UK homes - is thanks to a combination of rarity, 
performance and history.

In 1953, with Umberto Maglioli at the
wheel, the car set record setting pace in the Carrera Panamericana 
where is averaged 138mph over a 223-mile stage - an unbroken record.

Ferrari fitted the sports car with a 4.5-litre V12 engine which developed 350bhp - a staggering figure for the time.

This
gives the 60-year-old car a top speed of 170mph, although Sir Paul 
admitted in a recent interview had hadn't dare take it anywhere near 
that.

He said: 'The fastest
I have been is about 120mph, but the thought of Maglioli driving it in 
Mexico at 170mph beggars belief - he must have been scared.

'I bet he didn't get paid much either. When you think who drove it, it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.'

The Ferrari was the headline lot at RM Auctions sale in Italy, with 40 cars selling for a combined £23 million.

Max
Girardo, managing director, RM Europe, said: 'Once again, we have 
demonstrated that auction really is the only way to sell important cars.

'Over 25 per cent of lots exceeded their pre-sale estimates, with a number of model specific records achieved.

'It
is clear that RM's truly global reach and its unsurpassed investment in
exceptional marketing and promotion brings an international audience to
our sales that would be impossible to access any other way.'
