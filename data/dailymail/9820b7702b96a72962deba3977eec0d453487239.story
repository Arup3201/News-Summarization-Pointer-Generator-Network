Police are investigating the 'suspicious' death of this nine-year-old boy, named locally as Alex, at a Lincoln home yesterday afternoon

A grieving father has paid tribute to his nine-year-old son after his 'suspicious' death in Lincoln yesterday. 

Police are investigating the death of a nine-year-old boy, named locally as Alex, and say they are speaking with a 64-year-old man in connection to the incident.

Alex's father, John Robinson, paid tribute to his son on Facebook with the heart-breaking message: 'My little boy up in heaven the brightest star shining ever xxx.'

Officers were called to an address in Pennell Street, Lincoln, shortly before midday yesterday and remain at the scene today.

Alex was taken by ambulance to Lincoln County Hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later.

A post mortem will be carried out this morning to establish the cause of death and police say the preliminary results are not expected before this afternoon. 

A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said yesterday the boy's death was being treated as suspicious and that a 64-year-old man is 'helping police with inquiries'. 

A cordon was put in place at the address while officers conduct an examination of the scene and they remain at the house today.

Christmas decorations can be seen inside the house.

Friends and family have taken to Facebook to express their grief and pay tribute to Alex, 'a lovely' little boy.

One woman said: 'Gorgeous boy, Rip Alex. Another Angel taken to soon xxx.'

Another said: 'Rip little man, heavens gained another young angel xxx.'

Kayleigh Hardwick, 26, who lives next door to the house alone with her husband Paul, 27, said she saw a man being led from the address in handcuffs, before being driven away by police.

The mother of two said she believed a family lived at the property - the boy, a girl aged about five, a woman and her partner.

She said: 'We've seen the little lad out on his bike and sometimes we've seen him in his window bouncing on his bed.'

Neighbour Paula Smith, 43, said she was sickened to hear of the death of the boy.

She said: 'I've lived here for eight years and I'm sickened that this has happened so near to Christmas. 

'I feel so sorry for the family that are involved. I used to see the little boy going up and down the street on his scooter being followed by his little sister.

'I don't know the family but I can't believe that this has happened. It's tragic and it's awful.

'He was such a young boy who had got all his life ahead of him.

'He was such a pleasant little boy who always said hello to you even though I didn't know him.'

Alex's father paid tribute to his son and said: 'My little boy up in heaven the brightest star shining ever'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named said: 'It's really tragic. There are police outside in the street and I don't think anyone knows exactly what happened at this stage.

'He looked like a lovely little boy but I never really spoke to the family. It's usually a very quiet street.'

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said this morning: 'The 64-year-old man continues to assist us with our investigation.

‘There will be continuing police activity in the vicinity of Pennell Street including house to house enquiries and forensic work at the scene.

‘Anyone with any information is asked to call Lincolnshire Police via the non-emergency 101 telephone number quoting incident number 162 of 23rd December 2014.’
