A schoolgirl has spoken of how she has been bombarded with death threats for the last 18 months over her friendship with an X Factor star.

Chloe Allan, 15, began messaging singer Sam Callahan before he appeared on the show last year, and has attended a number of his gigs since.

But she has since been sent thousands of hateful messages from online trolls.

Her mother Julie, 40, has vowed to do 'whatever it takes' to track down and unmask the trolls who she claims have sent her daughter messages everyday for the last year-and-a-half.

Chloe, from Aberdeenshire, said: 'I am upset and scared all the time. It all started totally out of the blue.

'But it has been getting worse. We keep blocking the accounts but whoever it is just keeps setting them up again.

'They say things like we know when you are coming to Glasgow. We know what train you are getting. We are going to be there and will kill you when you arrive.'

Chloe started messaging the singer on Twitter when she saw him performing with another band District3.

He was voted off X-Factor last year and Sam - who hopes to go into entertainment PR - helped him get gigs and radio interviews in Scotland.

Mother Julie has tried to get Twitter bosses to stop the daily death threats, but claims they 'don't consider it an emergency' and has vowed to take them to court.

She said: 'Chloe has been receiving these awful messages, death threats, every night for a year-and-a-half.

'Chloe will block the abusive account but then another one is made the same day.

'It's unbelievable that Twitter can't help because they don't consider it an emergency.

'It's absolutely ludicrous. Twitter need to start taking some responsibility for this.

'Some of these messages that are coming through to Chloe say "I'm untouchable, I can't get caught".

'I'm willing to battle this no matter how much it takes, no matter how long it takes.

'This person will be caught, I will make sure of it - even if that takes getting my solicitor to get a court order for Twitter to reveal their name.

'It's just a sad day when a parent has to go that far to protect her daughter.

'They have been posting stuff about my house and how they're going to come over so for Twitter to say that's not an emergency is a kick in the teeth.'

Julie does not want to completely take Chloe off social networking because she says it is a necessity for connecting with her friends.

A police spokesman said investigations were ongoing.

Twitter has said the company could not discuss individual accounts for 'privacy and security reasons'.

It said it has established processes in place for working with law enforcement and makes information and advice available for users who feel they are the target of online abuse.
