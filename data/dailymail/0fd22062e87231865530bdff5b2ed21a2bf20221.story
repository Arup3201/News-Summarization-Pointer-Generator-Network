Jermain Defoe has flown back to England to thrash out his future ahead of the transfer window which re-opens next week - and Queens Park Rangers are the leading contenders to sign him.

Defoe, who is contracted to MLS side Toronto FC, was in London last weekend and is keen on a return to the Barclays Premier League.

Toronto are open to allowing him to leave but would prefer a deal that would see him go on a permanent basis rather than a loan.

It is understood Defoe prefers a move to Loftus Road, where he would be reunited with Harry Redknapp - who he has worked with at West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham.

Redknapp is keen to re-sign Defoe, 32, after failing in a bid to take him in the summer. But with owner Tony Fernandes keeping a tighter rein on the club’s finances, putting together a financial package could yet prove a stumbling block.

Toronto want to recoup as much of the £6million they paid Tottenham as possible, while Defoe is on a lucrative £60,000-per-week deal.

Redknapp flew to Malaysia last week to discuss transfer targets with Fernandes - and Defoe is a priority.

Leicester are also interested.
