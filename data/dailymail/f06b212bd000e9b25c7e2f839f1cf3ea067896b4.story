England say hooker Josh Hodgson will be disciplined after smashing through a door during a party in Dunedin at the end of their Four Nations tour.

Footage of the incident below shows the former Hull KR forward taking a run-up and hurling himself through the closed door of a student flat then celebrating.

The incident came in the wake of England's 16-14 defeat by New Zealand which cost them a place in next Saturday's final in Wellington.

Hodgson, 25, who is to stay on in the southern hemisphere to take up a two-year contract with Canberra Raiders, was dropped for his country's final round-robin game after making his Test debut against Samoa in the opening game of the tournament in Brisbane. He also played in the defeat by Australia in Melbourne.

The event rekindles memories of the acts of alcohol-fuelled incidents that marred England's 2013 World Cup campaign, in which Gareth Hock was thrown out of the squad, Zak Hardaker was punished for breaking the rules and other players faced disciplinary action on the eve of the opening game, although a spokesman for the tourists said the players were given permission to go out. 

England issued a statement apologising for the incident and pledging to arrange for the repairs to be made to the door.

The statement, issued on behalf of the squad by team manager Jon Roberts, said: 'We were made aware of an incident that occurred last night around lunchtime today.

'It is being dealt with internally with the person involved and they will be disciplined.

'The players were given permission to go out after last night's game.

'On behalf of England Rugby League, we apologise for the behaviour and have arranged for the repair of the small amount of damage.

England lost 16-14 to New Zealand on Saturday, a result which means they will not play in the final next week

After the game in Dunedin, the England players went on a night out to celebrate the end of the tour

'We have had a great time in Dunedin and the city has made us welcome. Last night's match was a great spectacle for International rugby league and we look forward to returning to the city in the future.'

The England squad will fly to Wellington on Monday before the Super League-based players board return flights for England via Sydney on Tuesday.

The players watched the final round-robin game from their Dunedin hotel as Australia gained the win over Samoa that confirmed their exit from the tournament.
