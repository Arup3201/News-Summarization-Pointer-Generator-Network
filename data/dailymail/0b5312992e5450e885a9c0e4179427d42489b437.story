Struck off: Vanessa Law, 32, broke into a house and stole cash while addicted to heroin

A primary school teacher who broke into a house and stole cash to fund her heroin habit is to be formally struck off from the profession.

Vanessa Law, 32, also stole petrol from garages in Fife and Glasgow during a crime spree in 2012.

The former addict is currently living at her grandmother's house in Fife, Scotland, where she claims to be 'in recovery'.

She will be officially taken off the teaching register at a 'removal with consent' hearing on November 5.

The General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) charged her with five offences including one on July 2012 in Lochgelly, Fife, where she stole a key and participated in theft by housebreaking.

It is thought that Ms Law, who worked at the nearby Methilhill Primary, broke into the house to help fund her drug habit.

The GTCS report also claims that Law 'while working as a teacher [was] actively using illegal drugs, namely heroin'.

They add that in March  2012 she stole  fuel from a Shell garage, and later that year she repeated the crime in Glasgow and Dunfermline.

Answering the door of her grandmother's home this week Ms Law said: 'I just want to say I'm in recovery, I don't really want to speak about it right now because it's personal.

'Life is getting better day by day, I'm in recovery'.

Recovery: Ms Law did not wish to comment except to say: 'Life is getting better day by day, I'm in recovery'

Previous job: Ms Law worked as a teacher at Methilhill Primary School between August 2011 and October 2012

Fife Council have refused to comment on Ms Law's case saying: 'We never discuss individual circumstances of either former or current employees.'

Methilhill Primary School confirmed that Ms Law worked at the school between August 15, 2011, and October 28, 2012.  

The house that Ms Law was caught raiding belongs to Andrew Whitelaw, a convicted paedophile who was serving a four-and half-year sentence at the time of the burglary.

Mr Whitelaw had at the house the largest haul of child pornography ever seized by Fife Police - 204,000 indecent images and 3,001 indecent videos of children.

Whitelaw also served time behind bars for assaulting eight children.
