Only recently have I apologised properly to the next-door neighbours in Harlow where I grew up. 

Hour after hour I would be outside, hitting a football against a wall which adjoined their house.

Winter or summer, I would be outside from the age of six, kicking the ball. My mum passed away in May and at her funeral I met those neighbours again and we had a chuckle about what they had to put up with.

There were also some garages around the corner, with brick columns in between, and I would try to make sure I passed the ball on to the columns. It was just hours and hours of passing, left foot, right foot, whatever the weather.

Hoddle insists 'whatever technique I ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours'

The reforms for grassroots football reminded the former England manager of those hours of practising

Sometimes I would use a smaller ball, to make it more difficult. I would even challenge myself to juggle a marble, to see how well I could do it.

I am convinced that whatever technique I ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours practising, manipulating the ball. Eventually, the ball almost becomes a part of your body and you are in total control of it.

I was reminded of those evenings last week, when the Football Association Commission, of which I am a member, announced their reforms for grassroots football. 

The key points were that the FA are aiming to build 1,000 3G artificial pitches by 2020, with 150 football hubs around the country identified as areas that will benefit from them. And we will increase the number of qualified Level Three coaches — that is the level just below the UEFA badges — from 800 to 3,000.

The England team against San Marino included young players but Hoddle hopes more will filter through now

These days it is much more difficult for kids to practise on the street like I did. But what we have to do is create environments where young people can get the same kind of advantages that I had practising against the garage doors in Harlow. 

Most importantly, we need to create a structure and facilities where control of the football is everything.

When I played the game, I always loved to manipulate the ball. The game is football. It is not headball, nor chaseball or runball. If you can master control of the ball at a young age, you have a hell of chance to be a good player.

But in England at times we have struggled with technique. It is a problem I have thought about for years as a player and then as England manager. There is no doubt control of the ball has held us back.

Time after time, we talk about our inability to keep possession or about the superior techniques of foreign players. But there is nothing inherently superior about foreigners. And the climate isn’t hugely different in Holland and Germany. 

What is different are the coaching and the facilities. Perhaps some people may not appreciate just how revolutionary the installation of a 3G pitch can be. For decades we’ve tried to get by on poorly-maintained grass pitches. In the winter they can be mud heaps and out of use for weeks on end.

On these new pitches, you can play time and time again without damage, meaning they can be used all day and night. And the run of the ball is that much smoother, so control of it becomes imperative. Sometimes, on some pitches that youngsters currently use, kick and run is the only way to play.

I went to watch my eight-year-old nephew play the other week. When we turned up, the grass was so long it made the game ridiculous. The ball would not roll properly. It didn’t matter how skilful you were. It wouldn’t have made any difference because you couldn’t show it on a pitch like that.

I have always been impressed with how they restructured youth football in Japan to produce a generation of technical players. They insist that, until the age of eight, football is about playing with the ball, manipulating it, in one-v-one situations. They don’t play matches. And when they do play games, at a later age, it is on smaller pitches with proportionate goals.

The FA have already made great strides in this area, now insisting on small-sided games and smaller goals for youth football. I would maybe take it even further. I don’t think you need to be on the bigger pitches until you’re 16. That way, we develop skill rather than physique.

Greg Dyke is hopeful that the new plans can boost grassroots football and help develop new England stars

Don’t get me wrong. Physical strength and stamina are part of the game. But they can be added later, when children have grown up. 

The rudiments of mastering a football are what cannot be grafted on to an adult. Decision-making and tactical awareness can also be taught by the qualified coaches. Mums and dads and volunteers do a great job sustaining our grassroots but there comes a time when professional input is required.

In the past, it seems that the FA have dealt with our failures by sacking managers. Since FA chairman Greg Dyke initiated his Commission last year, we are now at least addressing some of the root causes. Football skills are built at a young age. The problems of English football will never be solved from the top down.

It is from the grassroots upwards that we will begin to see a change in how we play the game. That takes time. Results do not come in eight months but rather over eight years. It does not necessarily grab headlines. 

But, believe me, there is more substance in the action taken this week than in all the many dismissals of England managers over the last 40 years.
