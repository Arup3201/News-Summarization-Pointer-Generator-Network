Summer bank holidays could be moved to winter to give people a day off in the run up to Christmas, in plans touted by a government think tank.

Government wellbeing officers are considering moving some of the national days off in order to spread them out across the year.

At present, there are two bank holidays in May, often shortly after the Easter break, and one at the end of August - leaving the country without another day off between the summer and the four months until Christmas.

In a blog on 'Wellbeing and why it matters' Lisa Ollerhead, from the Government's wellbeing unit, said that a break could be good for the country, and added: 'After a few more years of data we might even consider moving a bank holiday into early winter when the nights are drawing in and we're feeling low.'

The paper also looked at who was happiest in their careers - with publicans, care escorts and construction workers scoring the lowest levels of satsifaction.

It said: 'While highly-paid Chief Executives and senior officials do well, take-home pay doesn’t seem to be the only important factor.

Occupations like publicans and members of the clergy, which have similar income levels, seem to have very different levels of wellbeing.'

Churchmen and women topped the league table, joined by farmers, fitness instructors and school secretaries in enjoying a modest salary but high personal satisfaction, according to the breakdown prepared by a think-tank.

At the other end of the scale, the most miserable workers in the country are pub landlords – and their bar staff are not far from them at the bottom of the league table of job satisfaction, the  report reveals.

Those who go to work with a heavy heart also include debt collectors, industrial cleaners, call centre salespeople and security guards.

The table was drawn up by a group led by former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell, who persuaded David Cameron to spend £2million a year collecting statistics on our happiness.

Lord O’Donnell believes politicians should make decisions based on people’s level of well-being as well as on economic benefit.

The breakdown takes into account both pay and the sense of achievement and personal reward.

To be happy, a worker must have a clear idea of what is expected of them, some freedom and control, feel valued by their boss and achieve the best balance between work and family time.

‘Not all jobs are a bed of roses,’ said the report published by the Legatum Institute think-tank.

‘Job satisfaction is on a long-term downward trend in most advanced countries, and people rank time spent with their manager as among their least happy moments in the day.’
