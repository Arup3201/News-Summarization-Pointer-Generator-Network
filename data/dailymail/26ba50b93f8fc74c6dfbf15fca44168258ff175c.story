Sometimes instant coffee just won’t cut it, and what you really need is a filtered brew.

And now coffee fans can get their filtered caffeine fix on the go thanks to the world’s first disposable coffee machine.

The product works like a teabag for coffee and promises to brew a quality cup just by adding hot water to the bag.

Giving it a shot: The system was created by Ulrik Rasmussen 46 from Denmark when he ran out of coffee filters for his home coffee machine

The water mixes with ground coffee then drips through a special filter into another chamber, from where is can be poured into cups.

Danish designer Ulrik Rasmussen came up with the idea after studying teabags after running out of coffee filters for his home coffee machine.

He has spent the last nine years developing the product, which has just launched in Britain, and says it could revolutionise the way we drink coffee.

The product, called Grower's Cup, works like a teabag for coffee and promises to brew a quality cup just by adding some hot water to the bag. 

The water mixes with ground coffee then 
drips through a special filter into another chamber, from where is can 
be poured into cups.

Each 
Grower’s Cup pouch costs between £1 - £1.50 ($1.70 - $2.50) and they 
come in 12 different varieties using quality coffee beans from single 
estates.

A bag contains 0.6 ounces (18 grams) of ground coffee which makes two cups when 300ml of boiling water is added.

The product, called Grower’s Cup, can be used i at home, in the office to outdoors.

Mr Rasmussen, 46, from Middelfart in Denmark, said: ‘It all started one morning when I went to make myself a cup of coffee and realised I had run out of filters for my machine.

‘I needed my coffee fix and I was getting annoyed that it was so difficult to make a decent cup of coffee.

‘As I slammed the kitchen draw shut I noticed some tea bags and I started thinking about why there wasn’t a similar product for coffee.

‘I cut up a few tea bags and put coffee grounds inside them and found there was some potential for a similar product so I started doing research into it.

‘I wanted to come up with something that combined filter and French press coffee in one single solution.’

‘Nine years after I first started working on it we have launched Grower’s Cup, a convenient solution for the coffee lover who doesn’t want to compromise on quality,’ said Mr Rasmussen.

‘Coffee has all the same attributes as wine - you want to know where the coffee has come from, what its story is, and what quality it is.

‘Our coffee bag is to coffee what the wine bottle is to wine.’
