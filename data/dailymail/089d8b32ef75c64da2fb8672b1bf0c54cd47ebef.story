London's first 'plant-sitting' service was launched today as research shows nearly half of holidaymakers return to find their houseplants dead or dying.

The study revealed that while 57 per cent of Brits remember to clear out the fridge, and 65 per cent check electricity sockets are switched off, only 33 remember to ensure flowers are looked after.

A study of 2,000 Brits by www.thejoyofplants.co.uk revealed one in six (17 per cent) admit completely forgetting they even owned any plants.

This leads 43 per cent of Brits to return and find them looking parched, dusty and wilted.

Now these neglected leaves could be saved thanks to the very first Houseplant Hotel.

Launched by thejoyofplants.co.uk and TV gardening expert Charlie Dimmock, the business provides a special babysitting service for houseplants - for free.

For one week from July 4, staff will provide a collection service to holiday-bound owners in London, whisking their plants away to be looked after. 

It's part of a nationwide campaign to give forgotten ferns and stranded spider plants another chance at life.

Gardening expert and author Charlie, 47, known as a presenter on BBC’s Groundforce, and has also appeared on Celebrity Masterchef, said: ‘It's so simple to keep your plants healthy, even while you're on holiday.

‘Hopefully the thought of a Houseplant Hotel will remind everyone out there to check on their plants before checking in to their holidays.’

Nearly half of forgetful plant owners (45 per cent) admit preferring to throw out a wilted plant than try to revive it - a habit that costs Brits an estimated £829m a year.

It also means the average lifespan of a British houseplant stands at just seven months - when it could stretch for decades.

Charlie added: ‘I'm aware some people find it hard to care for their plants but I was surprised to hear such a vast number of Brits give up on their plants so easily.

‘As a plant-lover, I can't ever imagine chucking out a plant that still has the potential to bring so much character and life to your home.’

The Houseplant Hotel runs for one week from July 4 for holiday bound Brits in the London area.
