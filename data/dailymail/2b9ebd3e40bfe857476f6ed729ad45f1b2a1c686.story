Hundreds of Israelis lined up outside the country's parliament building on Sunday to pay their last respects to the late former prime minister and army general Ariel Sharon.

Sharon's coffin was displayed in a plaza in front of the Knesset, where a stream of visitors passed by to snap photos and say farewell. A funeral service to be attended by dignitaries from around the world, including U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, is scheduled for Monday.

The 85-year-old Sharon, one of Israel's most iconic and controversial figures, died Saturday, eight years after suffering a stroke that left him in a coma.

Uri Rottman, a mourner who said he once served in the military with Sharon, said: 'My heart is broken. Israel lost the King
 of David. There is no other word to describe this man, they don't make 
people like this anymore.'

Another former army comrade, Eliav Aviram, said: 'I feel committed to share the very last moment before they're going to bury him.'

Sharon was a farmer-turned-soldier, a soldier-turned-politician, a politician-turned-statesman - a leader known for his exploits on the battlefield, masterminding Israel's invasion of Lebanon, building Jewish settlements on war-won land and then, late in life, destroying some that he deemed no longer useful.

To his supporters, he was a war hero. To his critics, he was a war criminal. Israeli authorities closed off streets around the parliament in anticipation of huge crowds on Sunday.

Visitors were asked to park at lots in and around the city and were brought to the site by special buses. President Shimon Peres and former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who succeeded Sharon after the 2006 stroke, was among the visitors.

Olmert crossed past a roped-off area to stand silently next to the flag-draped coffin. A state memorial is planned for tomorrow at the parliament building.

In addition to Biden, former British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Czech Prime Minister Jiri Rusnok, German 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and others were expected.

Afterward Sharon's body will be taken by military convey for burial at his ranch in southern Israel.

News
 of Sharon dominated Israeli newspapers and broadcast reports, and 
Israel's three main TV stations all broadcast live from the memorial. 
Radio stations were filled with interviews with former officials and 
military men who shared stories of Sharon's exploits.

Sharon's
 career stretched across much of Israel's 65-year existence, and his 
life was closely intertwined with the country's history.

Throughout
 his life, he was at the center of the most contentious episodes of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, starting as a young soldier fighting in 
the 1948 war over Israel's creation.

In the 1950s, he led a commando unit 
that carried out reprisals for Arab attacks. In 1953, after the slaying 
of an Israeli woman and her two children, Sharon's troops blew up more 
than 40 houses in Qibya, a West Bank village then ruled by Jordan, 
killing 69 Arabs, most or all of them civilians.

Residents
 in Qibya on Sunday remembered the village's darkest hour. Qibya 
resident Hamed Ghethan was just four years old when the raid took place.
 He said he could remember older residents placing their hands over the 
children's mouths so they wouldn't make a sound.

'Sharon's
 name reminds me of... martyrs from my village,' said Ghethan, 65, as he
 surveyed the ruins of buildings destroyed in the military action.

As one of Israel's most famous generals, he was known for bold tactics and an occasional refusal to obey orders.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has paid tribute to Ariel Sharon by saying he was an 'important leader' for the country and said he had taken 'brave and controversial' decisions.

'Ariel Sharon is one of the most significant figures in Israeli history and as prime minister he took brave and controversial decisions in pursuit of peace, before he was so tragically incapacitated,' Mr Cameron said.

'Israel has today lost an important leader.'

The veteran soldier, nicknamed the 'bulldozer', fought in the series of wars that forged the state of Israel before entering politics in 1973.

Critics held him responsible for the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel's Lebanese Phalangist allies in Beirut refugee camps.

However, others pointed to his efforts to secure a stable peace as prime minister between 2001 and 2006, including unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.

Sharon was still in office when he suffered his stroke, and never regained consciousness.

Complications after surgery at the beginning of this month had seen a sharp deterioration in his condition.

Historians credit him with helping 
turn the tide of the 1973 Mideast war when Arab armies launched a 
surprise attack on Israel on the solemn fasting day of Yom Kippur, 
causing heavy Israeli casualties.

Sharon
 became a minister in Menachem Begin's government in the late 1970s, and
 voted against the historic 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.

But
 when it fell to Sharon to remove Jewish settlements from Egypt's Sinai 
Peninsula, he obediently ordered protesting settlers to be dragged away 
and their homes bulldozed to rubble.

As defense minister in 1982, Sharon launched the invasion of Lebanon, where he became complicit in one of bloodiest incidents of the Lebanese war, when Israeli-allied forces systematically slaughtered hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps in September 1982.

An Israeli judicial inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the killings, and he was forced to step down as defense minister. Yet over the years, he gradually rehabilitated himself by holding a number of Cabinet posts.

As opposition leader in September 2000, Sharon demonstratively visited a contested Jewish-Muslim holy site in Jerusalem, setting off Palestinian protests that quickly lurched into an armed uprising that ultimately killed hundreds of Palestinians and Israelis.

Several months later, he was elected prime minister. While Sharon ordered a tough crackdown on the Palestinian uprising, he made a dramatic about-face in 2003 when he announced his plans for a unilateral withdrawal from occupied lands.

In 2005, he directed a unilateral pullout of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year occupation.

He later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the centrist Kadima Party, with a platform promoting further territorial concessions and support for a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

It seemed he was on his way to an easy re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006.
