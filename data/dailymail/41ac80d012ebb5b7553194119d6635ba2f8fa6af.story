It's a scene that turned many heads as Tolkien fans from all over the world flocked to New Zealand to celebrate the third and final Hobbit movie.

About 200 attendees dressed as dwarves, elves and hobbits and wizards - all inspired by Lord of the Rings.

Among them were five dedicated Australian fans, from Melbourne, who spent a combined total of $65,000 on their elaborate costumes.

Needless to say it's a highly elaborate affair - one that's taken very seriously, especially by 23-year-old Victoria Gridley.

Middle-earth fans from all over the world flocked to New Zealand last week to celebrate the third and final Hobbit movie, The Battle of the Five Armies. Among them include five Aussies (pictured)

Ms Gridley, of Croydon in Melbourne's east, isn't shy about her obsession with the fantasy world.

'The first time I went to New Zealand was with my best friend for the launch of the first Hobbit movie [An Unexpected Journey] in 2012 and we cried on camera,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Since then we've been going ever year and I love it.'

Each year Ms Gridley designs and hand-makes her costume for the event.

And this year's launch of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was no exception.

'I went as one of my favourite characters Bombur - a big dwarf with ginger hair,' she said.

'I think I spent about $750 on the whole costume, including the hair and fat suit.

'Including the two other years I dressed up for the event, I've spent about $2000 on the costumes - if not more.' 

The Aussie fans walked the streets of Wellington during their visit last week

'Dressing up is like an escape from reality because life can be a bit boring for me sometimes,' Ms Gridley said

Dedicated fans have been visiting New Zealand since 2012 for the launch of the Hobbit trilogy each year

Many of the costumes are hand-made and designed by fans themselves

Ms Gridley, who currently works at a call centre, has been designing costumes as a hobby for seven years.

'Dressing up is like an escape from reality because life can be a bit boring for me sometimes,' she said.

She and her friends also like to walk the streets of Melbourne, and of Wellington when they're in town, dressed as characters from Middle-earth.

In February, she plans on moving to New Zealand - living near the film sets of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit.

'I'm going there because I got accepted into a costume construction course and I've already found a place that's literally just around the corner from where the movies were filmed so I'm really excited about that,' she said.

To mark the final launch of The Hobbit trilogy, film director Peter Jackson lent more than 20 costumes and props from the third movie for 'The Middle of Middle-earth Costume Trail'.

The trail, spread across 15 locations in Wellington which gives insight into the artistry behind the movies, opened last Thursday to coincide with the New Zealand launch of the film which premiered in London on December 1.
