Knowing the best cuts of meat, your prosciutto from your carpaccio and what wine to have with your meal determines whether you are a foodie, a study has revealed. 

A true foodie shops for local food, never dines out at chain restaurants and often asks to speak to the chef after a good meal.

They also know restaurant recommendations off the top of their head and have access to a cupboard full of fresh herbs and spices, the poll of 2,000 adults found.

High standards: Foodies are quick to complain when served a bad meal, the survey of 2,000 people found

Expert knowledge: Asking the butcher to prepare meat a specific way is a sign of a true foodie 

Four in ten adults considered themselves a foodie whilst 55 per cent said food is one of the most important aspects of their lifestyle.

Forty-three percent said that 'real' foodies knows all the best restaurants whilst 35 per cent think a foodie would confidently use terms such as terrine, carpaccio and prosciutto in a conversation.

They also know the best cuts of meat and which wine goes with which meal - and will always write a review of a restaurant on returning home.

And it seems having a foodie friend would be educational as almost three in ten said they would expect one to know where their food comes from, as well as the nutritional content.

Kimberly Hurd, from Zomato UK, which carried out the survey, said it's now much easier for Brits to become culinary experts.  

She said: 'Food from all cultures is easily and readily available to us these days, and Britons can explore and experiment more than ever.

'Whilst some people think the only convenient option is to go to a chain restaurant, they'd be surprised how easy it is to find a new or independent restaurant.

'With this in mind it's no surprise that more and more people consider themselves "foodies".

'And it has its advantages – meeting and knowing foodies means you'll never eat a bad meal again.'

According to 15 per cent, a foodie would snub chain-diners in fear of a bad meal, choosing instead to support local, independent eateries.

They would also have knowledge of hidden gem restaurants and be able to recommend them off the top of their head.

More than half said they were a foodie because, when faced with a menu, they are not averse to trying something new.

A confident 41 per cent said their interest in going out to eat has given them an expert knowledge in food.

Whilst a further 32 per cent claimed they deserved the name because they prefer to eat locally-sourced food rather than grab a bite of fast food.
