German Chancellor Angela Merkel won an historic third term in power this evening - making her the only European leader not to become a casualty of Europe’s financial crisis.

Official results have now confirmed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives won Germany's election with 41.5 per cent of the vote but indicate that they have finished short of an absolute majority.

Its coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, slumped to 4.8 percent - not enough to win seats. 

Challenger Peer Steinbrueck's Social Democrats won 25.7 percent, their Green allies 8.4 percent and the hard-line Left Party 8.6 percent. The likeliest outcome for coalition is with the Social Democrats.

Win: Chancellor and leader of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Angela Merkel has won a third term in office

Victory: General Secretary Hermann Groehe congratulates the Chancellor after exit polls broadcast on German television showed Merkel's Christian Democratic Union had won 42 per cent of the vote

All smiles: Merkel told her supporters this evening that the result was 'super' and that they should 'celebrate'

Exit poll figures released on German television shows the CDU and CSU have won 42.5 per cent of the vote

Speaking earlier this evening, the Chancellor, 59, said
it was too early to discuss plans for the next government.

Merkel said: 'I see the next four years in front of me and I can promise that we will face many tasks, at home, in Europe and in the world.

'We will do all we can in the next four years together to make them successful years for Germany. 

'It is too early to say how we will proceed but today we should celebrate.'

The result is an improvement of more than eight points on the last election in 2009.

The Union's strong showing was also personal victory for Merkel, who has held the position since 2005, solidifying her position as arguably Europe's strongest political leader.

Victory
at the polls was tempered by a disastrous showing from the liberal Free
Democratic Party (FDP) - Merkel's current junior coalition party - 
which only won 4.8 per cent of the vote.

It means they cannot rule for a second term in power with the incumbent Chancellor.

The result could see the center-right party face an embarrassing ejection from parliament also.

The exit polls were greeted by shocked silence by the Free Democrats' at their election event.

Four years ago, the party won nearly 15 percent of the vote, its best-ever result - but the party has taken much of the blame for squabbling in Merkel's governing coalition since then.

Joy: Supporters of Merkel's party celebrate at CDU headquarters as the first exit polls are published

Merkel's supporters were elated at the result, which sees the Chancellor remain in power for a third term

'It's the bitterest, saddest hour of the Free Democratic Party,' the party's leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said.

The Chancellor will now 
most likely join with the centre-left Social Democratic 
Party (SPD) – the equivalent to the British Labour party - which is 
opposed to many of her conservative principles and policies.

Peer Steinbrueck, leader of the SPD, came in second place on around 26 percent.

Speaking this evening, Peer Steinbrueck said: 'We did not achieve the result we wanted.

'The ball is in Merkel's court. She has to get herself a majority.'

According to media reports, SPD leader
Peer Steinbrueck was already resigned to being Mrs. Merkel’s understudy
for the next four years as the junior partner in a coalition before 
voting started today.

Good result: Merkel's supporters continued to celebrate after the result was announced

Merkel's CDU was favourite to win the election, following an upbeat campaign focusing on the party's successes over the past two terms

The SPD was Merkel's coaltion partner in her first term.

Both
parties are committed to saving the euro and to the 
'Mittelstand' - small-to-medium-sized businesses that form the backbone 
of the export led economy.

However, the SPD is a party of higher 
taxes, minimum wages and workers' rights, limited military involvement 
abroad and a host of neo-liberal family policies certain to rub against 
Mrs. Merkel's avowed intent to carry on down the path of austerity.

Manfred
Guellner, managing director of the pollster Forsa said: 'There are many
within the SPD who oppose the idea of going into a grand coalition with
Merkel’s bloc.'

He added that many want assurances they will not merely be Angela”s 'Mummy's Boys' at her beck and call for the next four years.

Bad news: Free Democrat (FDP) supporters looked stunned as it is announced their party will no longer be in coalition with the CDU after winning just 4.5 per cent of the vote

Second place: Social Democratic (SPD) party candidate Peer Steinbrueck waves to supporters after learning his party came second with 26 per cent of the vote. He is most likely to enter into coalition with Merkel

Elsewhere, the Alternative for Deutschland party –
which is opposed to the euro – scored just four percent, a whole 
per cent less than the total needed to get into parliament.

The
hard-left Linke Pary won five percent, and the Greens scored nine 
percent, but neither have enough votes to form a government with the 
SPD.

There was a poor 
showing for the NPS neo-Nazi party which also failed to gain enough 
votes to get into parliament for the first time.

Early indications pointed to a higher 
turnout than four years ago, election officials said - with 41.4 per 
cent of eligible voters casting their ballots by 2pm, four hours before 
polling stations closed.

That compared with 36.1 per cent at the same 
point in 2009.

Results: Supporters of the left-wing "Die Linke", who received 5 per cent of the vote, gather for the exit poll announcement at the party headquarters this evening

The
coming hours and days will see a frantic round of negotiations between 
the CDU and the SPD as they carve up ministries and posts to satisfy all
sides in their respective parties.

After
leading Germany through the economic crisis, Mrs. Merkel went into the 
race for power more popular than ever - portraying herself as a safe 
pair of hands as the crisis claimed leaders in France, Greece, Italy and
Spain.

Pre-polls gave Merkel popularity ratings of 
about 70 per cent.

Before voting today, Merkel called her current coalition 'the 
most successful government since reunification' 23 years ago.

She pointed to the robust economy and unemployment which, at 6.8 per cent, is very 
low for Germany and far below that of many other European countries.

Germany's first post-war chancellor, conservative Konrad Adenauer, won the only single-party majority so far in 1957.

He formed a coalition with a smaller party anyway, but the Union governed on its own from mid-1960 to late 1961 after most of that party's lawmakers defected to it.
