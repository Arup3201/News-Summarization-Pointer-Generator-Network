They have both built their careers around their looks and have long-favoured fake tan, false eyelashes and full lips.

But Katie Price and Alicia Douvall, who both speak openly about their exhaustive list of cosmetic procedures, have swapped their cherished beauty products for a bare-faced look in the Celebrity Big Brother house.

With nowhere to hide thanks to cameras operating 24/7 in every room, both women's au-natural looks are on display for all to see.

Celebrity Big Brother stars and cosmetic fans Katie Price, pictured, and Alicia Douvall have been going bare-faced in the house... so who looks better without the slap?

But both women have had more than little help to boost their beauty. 

Katie, 36, had her first breast augmentation when she was 18 and, since then, has had a series of operations that have left her with the C chest she has today.

On top of that, she opted for two nose jobs, hair extensions, Botox and veneers. 

And while she may have shot to fame as the UK's most famous glamour model with a penchant for fake tan, peroxide hair extensions and heavy eye make-up, the star recently told FEMAIL she's left those days long behind her.

The mother-of-four maintains that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline.

The model and entrepreneur said: 'The older you get, the less interested in make-up you are. A smokey eye is ageing and with four kids, the last thing on my mind is make-up. 

'In fact, I don't wear any. Vaseline is the only thing in my make-up bag to keep my lips moisturised.'

She did, however, admit that she swears by four beauty treatments that she's been having since her final years of school.

'I have my eyelashes and eyebrows tinted every week. I think good brows are really important and I love having a matching manicure and pedicure. I've had the same girl doing it for six years,' she said.

Alicia, meanwhile, has had a staggering 18 operations to enhance her breasts - the first when she was 17.

The glamour model, also 36, has apparently had more than 350 procedures since then to enhance her looks.

One of her most dramatic procedures was one to shave her ribs in order to reduce her waist, and even surgery to break her toes so that they fit into her designer shoes. 

Speaking to the Independent in 2009, Alicia admitted that she was 'addicted' to surgery.

'I've had so many operations that I can't feel my stomach, my left breast, or anything under my right arm,' she said. 'I've had 15 boob jobs. I've changed my eyes and nose, had facelifts.

'My philosophy is, "if it can be changed, it will be". It's got to the stage where doctors in Britain refuse to treat me any more, so I've been flying to the US for surgery and lying about my medical history.'

Alicia - real name born Sarah Howes - was diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a condition whereby sufferers are obsessed and paranoid about their appearance. Alicia has been to rehab three times.

Alicia has been sharing details of her procedures live on TV. Admitting they used 'pig skin' to give her breast tissue, the mother told Katie Hopkins and Michelle Visage, 'I’d rather be dead than not have t*ts…I could not live without t*ts.'

Michelle tries to reassure her that 'being a woman comes from within' and admits she can’t wait to have her implants taken out after having three boob jobs herself. 

The topic of discussion came up after Alicia asked Katie Hopkins if she would ever have a boob job if she was offered one for free.

Katie admits 'it would be quite nice to have some boobs', before complimenting Alicia and Michelle on theirs. Alicia admits that she was flat chested before she had 18 boob jobs.

Alicia adds, 'The brutal truth is, looks do matter'.
