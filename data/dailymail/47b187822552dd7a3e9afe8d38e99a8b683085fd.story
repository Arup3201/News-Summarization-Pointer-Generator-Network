A grandmother has finally reached her ideal weight at the age of 77 - after a diet lasting 50 years.

Brenda Boxall started slimming in her late 20s after her weight ballooned to 20 stone.

She vowed to shed the pounds after seeing a picture of herself in the early 1960s and thinking she looked like a 'big blob'.

Super slim: Brenda Boxall (pictured left in 1997 when she weighed 16 stone and right, today) has finally reached her weight loss target at the age of 77 - after a diet lasting a staggering 50 years

Now, after more than 
half a century of dieting and exercising, she has finally shifted the 
excess fat and is now her target weight of 9st 9lbs.

Over 50 years she has also shrunk from a dress size 30 to just a size 10.

Mrs Boxall, a retired teacher from Newquay, Cornwall, says she is finally happy with her body shape.

Mrs Boxall, a retired teacher from Newquay, Cornwall, says she is finally happy with her body shape. She said: 'I've wanted to get to this weight since my 20s'

She said: 'I’ve wanted to get to this 
weight since my 20s. The diet went well over the first few years but for
 the past 40 I’ve been struggling to lose the last three stone.

'Now I’ve finally got there it feels lovely. I feel like a different person. I have more confidence and feel a lot healthier.'

Her weight battle began in the late 1950s after the breakdown of her first marriage.

Heartbroken, she says she turned to bread, pastries and cakes and consumed more than 7,000 calories a day.

Mrs Boxall said: 'I would eat anything that would come my way - lots of carbohydrates including a lot of bread and crisps.

'When
 I was at my biggest I wore clothes which were like tents. There was no 
fashion in those days for people as large as I was.'

She vowed to get her size 
under control after recoiling at photos of her size-30 body - and set 
herself a target of losing ten stone.

She said: 'At one point I saw a picture of myself in the local paper I looked like a big green blob.

'From
 that point on I was determined to lose weight. I threw those clothes 
away and vowed to reach my target - no matter how long it took.'

Mrs Boxall cut out cakes and stuck to a strict diet but could never quite achieve her ideal weight loss of ten stone.

Slimming down: Brenda in 2008 when she weighed 14 stone and today. She said: 'Now I’ve finally got to my target weight it feels lovely. I feel like a different person. I have more confidence and feel a lot healthier'

She shed seven stone
 over the next decade but no matter how hard she tried, could never 
shift the remaining three.

But she refused to give in and maintained her diet and exercise regime for the next 50 years.

Finally, she turned to WeightWatchers in 2010 and slowly crept towards her target weight in October of that year.

Since then she has not only maintained her petite size 10 frame, she’s lost a further five pounds.

Mrs Boxall, who lives with her second husband Victor Boxall, 84, maintains her new figure with long walks and exercises programmes she does at home.

She still attends the WeightWatchers class in Newquay where she was presented with the gold celebratory cake to mark her marathon achievement.

Her WeightWatchers leader, Dawn McKenna, said: 'She has certainly been an inspiration in losing weight healthily and keeping it off.'
