Former The Only Way Is Essex star Amy Childs said she was lucky to be alive after flipping her Range Rover Autograph Sport on Wednesday night.

The salon owner amazingly managed to climb out, apparently uninjured, of the luxury vehicle, after it rolled in South Woodford, North East London around 10pm.

Paramedics were quickly on the scene to attend to the dazed 24-year-old as she sat by the roadside while witnesses looked on.

Fire and police officers arrived quickly at the accident, from which Amy walked away unscathed

No other vehicles were involved in the collision that happened outside the Napier Arms pub on Woodford New Road near Walthamstow forest.

A witness on the scene confirmed to MailOnline that roof of the Range Rover was 'smashed in' and revealed that the 'front of the car was hanging off'.

During the incident it is thought that the car struck a traffic island and crashed into two lampposts.

The witness also said that Amy appeared to be in 'shock' and was 'shaken' as she sat on the pavement.

A spokesperson for the star told MailOnline: 'Amy is very shaken, ambulance services say she is lucky to be alive. The car is a complete right-off.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that police had been called to an address at Woodford New Road at approximately 10pm 'following reports of an over-turned car'.

The spokesman added: 'At this early stage it is believed that the vehicle was in collision with a traffic light. There are no reported injuries at this time and enquiries are continuing.' 

Following the accident, the road has been closed by police and motorists were told to find alternative routes.

The aftermath: The various pieces of wreckage show how serious the incident could have been 

Taking to Twitter just hours later, Amy wrote: 'I am so lucky to be alive thank you to everyone for your lovely messages'.

She added: 'God was definitely watching down on me'.

MailOnline contacted representatives for Amy who confirmed she was involved in an accident but had no further details about her condition.

Amy, who is dating AFC Bournemouth footballer Adam Smith, bought her beloved white Range Rover for around £60,000 from Imperials Cars in Romford in November 2012.

Known for her love of the catchphrase 'well jel' (meaning 'very jealous') on the first two series of the ITVBe show, Amy spent an additional £80,000 on the numberplate alone.

At the time, Amy claimed she ended up in a bidding war with a premiership footballer and a TOWIE producer to win the five letters and two numerals.

Caring: Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge popped around the next day to bring her some flowers and well wishes 

Breathing a sigh of relief: The reality star was met by Amy's concerned looking mum at the front door 

Justifying her choice of numberplate in an interview, she said: 'You know, honey, I created that word.' 

Amy left The Only Way Is Essex in 2011 after two series during which she was responsible for popularising the 'vajazzle' and her catchphrase 'well jel'.

She went on to appear alongside Jedward, Kerry Katona and Paddy Doherty on Celebrity Big Brother that same year, coming fourth.

Since leaving TOWIE, she has signed with CAN Associates - the same management company as Peter Andre - and turned her celebrity into a lucrative business.

She opened her own beauty salon in her hometown of Brentwood in 2011, as well as a boutique selling her namesake clothing range.

Amy has also released her own fragrance, calendar and is a frequent guest on celebrity TV panel and gameshows.

Ironically, Amy posed on a wrecked car with another 'well jel' numberplate in a promotional photoshoot for MoneySupermarket to launch their Car Insurance Epic Car Crusher.
