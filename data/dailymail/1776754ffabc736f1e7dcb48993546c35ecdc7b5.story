A police dog left an innocent man with an inch-deep wound in his leg after attacking him on his own doorstep.

Azmat Farooq, 37, was bitten when he returned from his job as a hotel chef to his home in Longsight, Manchester, at the same time as police were hunting a wheel alloy thief.

As a friend dropped him off the dog attacked - leaving him with a wound four inches long which put him in hospital for four days.

Wound: Hotel chef Azmat Farooq was left with a gash four inches long and an inch deep to his leg after being attacked by a police dog on his own doorstep last week. The dog has been withdrawn from police service

Laid up: Mr Farooq is unable to work after the attack. The 37-year-old said: 'I thought I was going to die'

The dog's future is uncertain after it was dropped immediately from police use, and the conduct of the officers involved is being reviewed.

Police have not confirmed what will happen to the dog but it is thought it may be put up for rehoming instead of being put down.

Mr Farooq, who works at the Manchester Airport Marriott Hotel, said: 'At the time I thought I was going to die, it's a very big wound.

A dog's life: The dog was searching for a wheel alloys thief, but Mr Farooq was innocent

'Although I was angry at the time I have appreciated the police efforts since. They have been asking how I am, checking up on me and an officer came to see me in hospital.'

The attack happened on Monday last week as Mr Farooq's friend Az Mahmood dropped him off.

Mr Mahmood said: 'When I saw all the commotion I turned round and went back to see what had happened.

'Azmat was on the floor and there was blood everywhere.

'It's ridiculous that this has been allowed to happen, the dogs are supposed to be trained but they had no control over that dog.'

Mr Farooq moved to Britain in December. Mr Mahmood added: 'He hasn't been in the country that long and now he can't work because of his injury.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A GMP police dog and handler were involved in the search for the offender and at around 12.50am on Stovell Avenue.

'A man who was not related to the search but who was on the street at the time, was bitten by the police dog... He was taken to hospital for treatment to a bite on his leg.

'Officers visited the man the next day to check on his welfare.

'GMP's Professional Standards Branch is aware of this incident.

'The police dog has since lost its licence.'

Evidence: The Marriott Hotel chef spent four days in hospital after the attack on Monday last week
