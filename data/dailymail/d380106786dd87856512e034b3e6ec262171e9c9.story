A recent LivingSocial survey showed that Americans may live up to their poor reputation while travelling abroad.

But what’s more surprising is that many of those surveyed self-identified themselves as ‘ugly’ Americans and the world’s worst travellers.

The results show that Americans, as well as Canadians and Australians all named U.S. 
travellers as the world's worst tourists.

Self-hating: In a LivingSocial survey, 20 per cent of Americans said they found American tourists to be the worst of the bunch

Those in the U.S. ranked themselves as 
the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent, followed by 15 per cent 
saying the Chinese were the most substandard tourists.

In the survey, more than 5,600 people in five countries were polled by Mandala Research LLC. 

However, hatred for the stereotypical fanny pack-toting American wasn’t universal in the study. 

The Irish ranked the British as the worst travellers, and similarly, the British thought very poorly of German tourists.

American travellers are stereotyped in a number of ways, but the most common are that they wear unflattering, casual clothing (such as cargo pants, sweatshirts, white trainers, and baseball caps) and talk too loudly.

Some think that speaking loudly equates speaking clearly, the stereotype goes, and more cruelly, American tourists are thought to be quite stout. 

In addition, four out of ten U.S. respondents said that they ‘accidentally’ packed or intentionally stole items from hotels, with towels being the most popular items to snatch.

In a more positive light, the study showed another American misconception was not true –  Americans, for the most part, are surprisingly well-travelled. 

The study showed that 78 per cent of Americans have visited at least one foreign country (though there was no word on if it was Canada or Mexico), and 61 per cent have visited more than one country.

The average American respondent said they visited more than four countries.

According to the findings, Americans also enjoyed fewer vacation days than their European counterparts, with only 16 days off versus 27 days (Australia), 21 days (Canada), 28 days (Ireland) and 23 days (U.K.). 

Out of their 16 days off, an average of four days was spent abroad, the report said.

Perhaps more depressing still was the fact that 66 per cent of Americans said they checked their email whilst on vacation.
