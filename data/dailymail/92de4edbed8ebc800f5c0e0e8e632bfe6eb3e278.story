And that is exactly what citizens of the Eternal City did this weekend as they took a step back in time to celebrate the 2,766th birthday of the capital.

Each year the streets become a stage for troupes of actors dressed as denizens of the ancient city, as they mark the legendary foundation of the Birth of Rome.

As soon as they were born the pair 
were placed in a trough and thrown into the River Tiber, but the trough 
came ashore and they were found by a wolf who fed them with her milk.

They were then raised by a shepherd, 
Faustulus. Reaching adulthood the twins decided to found a town, and 
chose the place where the wolf had nursed them.

Romulus
 began to build walls on the Palatine Hill, but Remus jeered at the low 
walls, leaping over them, and an angry Romulus killed him.

Romulus
 is alleged not to have died, just disappeared one day in a violent 
storm. The Romans, believing he had been taken up to heaven, worshipped 
him under the name of Quirinus.
