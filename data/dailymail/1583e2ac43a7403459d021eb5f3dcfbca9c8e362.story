The Singapore Grand Prix was, in terms of racing, the toughest day of the year for me. For our car to break down and then to watch the remainder of the action on the pit wall was a really strange feeling.

As soon as I stepped into the car before heading to the grid for the race everything stopped working. Up until that point it had all been fine, but the moment I sat in the cockpit we encountered problems which really was quite amazing.

My team managed to get the car up and running so I could head to the grid before the pit-lane closed. I remained positive and hoped that the problem would resolve itself because it was quite intermittent, but it didn't work out.

'It was like having only half a car,' says Rosberg (centre), such were the problems leading to his withdrawal

The cable connection in the steering column was short-circuited, so the steering wheel simply did not work. The gearshift paddles worked, but not to their full capacity as it was upshifting double gears. What I mean by that is when I wanted to go from third to fourth it went from third to fifth and so on. It really was all over the place.

I couldn't use KERS and I did not have any electrical power. I didn't have DRS either so it was like having only half a car. I was at the back of the field and couldn't pass the Caterham of Marcus Ericsson, so on lap 14 we decided to call it a day as it was pointless continuing like that. It wasn't my decision to retire, but the team felt it was in our best interest.

It was a big pity as we lost a lot of points, particularly to my team-mate Lewis who won the race. But after I retired I decided to hang around to see if I could learn anything. On the pit wall there is always an opportunity to listen in to what is going on so that's what I did and I certainly picked up a few pointers.

I could see what the team were doing strategically during the race. I have never had the opportunity to sit there and do that, so it was a good experience for me to see it from that point of view as I am normally in my race car.

The team apologised to me after the race which was a nice gesture from them. We now know what the problem was and I have absolutely moved on from it. I am very, very positive and looking forward to the final five races of the season. I should also mention that it was fantastic that we still had the best car in Singapore as it has been throughout the season. 

 During qualifying, it was incredible that Lewis and I were separated by just seven-thousandths of a second on a circuit which is over three miles in length. That difference between us both crossing the start-finish line on our respective laps was not even the width of my foot, but it decided first and second place on the grid which was pretty tough to take.

That said I was still pleased to be starting second and looking forward to what could have been a brilliant battle, but then we had our reliability issue.

Certainly reliability is the weakness of our team at the moment and we are working flat out to try and improve on that area. But I don't worry about the car breaking down. I trust my car. I trust my team, and if it happens, it happens, but it is not something I am concerned about at all.

I am now three points behind Lewis in the championship but I will not approach this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix any differently. The plan is to win and that has always been the case so I will try to do the same thing here.

It is an amazing situation to be in with the team and despite what happened in Singapore there is still everything to play for so I am in full-on attack heading into this weekend.

Indeed it is the first time that I have arrived in Suzuka knowing that I have the best car on this incredible circuit so we have the opportunity to be on pole and win which is an awesome feeling and I want to make the most of it.

Suzuka is without question one of the best circuits on the calendar and the fans are so enthusiastic and very, very unique. They go nuts for F1 which is, as a driver and someone who loves the sport, too, always brilliant to see.

It has been very wet this week but if it rains at any point over the weekend I am not concerned because our car is amazing in the damp conditions.

After the race in Singapore I went on holiday to Thailand to try and adapt to the timezone for this weekend's race so I have no jet lag.

I spent most of my time relaxing and training; having a rest in between races is always a good opportunity to ramp up the fitness, too.

The FRIC has been taken off the car so the diet which we were all concerned about before the start of the season is not as much of an issue now. I can easily put on a few kilos which is refreshing. But to be honest I have stuck closely to the same diet because I have plenty of energy and felt really good, having adapted my nutrition.

On Wednesday I was in Tokyo for a sponsors event and it really is an awesome city. There is so much that you can do there. I also went for dinner in a really amazing japanese restaurant. I always enjoy Japan very much!
