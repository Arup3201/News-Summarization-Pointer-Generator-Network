The capital of the Anglo-Saxon kings buried at Sutton Hoo may have been uncovered in farmland close to the famous burial mounds.

Archaeologists believe a royal settlement once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at Naunton Hall in Rendlesham near Woodbridge, Suffolk.

They say it included a wooden palace which would have been used by King Raedwald and other Anglo-Saxon rulers of Norfolk and Suffolk between the 6th and 9th Centuries.

Hidden treasure: Archaeologists believe they have found an ancient royal settlement which once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at Naunton Hall in Rendlesham near Woodbridge, Suffolk

It was only discovered after the owner of the land raised the alarm when illegal treasure hunters started scouring the area under the cover of night.

The site is only around four miles from the treasure-filled Sutton Hoo burial ship which is thought to be the grave of Raedwald who died in about 624 AD.

Rumours of a royal settlement in Rendelsham have persisted since it was first mentioned by the Venerable Bede, an 8th century monk and historian.

But it is only now that archaeologists have unearthed what they describe as 'conclusive evidence' to pinpoint the land where the settlement stood for around 300 years.

A series of Anglo-Saxon coins, fragments of gold jewellery, buckles, pieces of brooches and part of a hanging bowl have been found in the fields over the past five years, indicating that a village was once there.

A Visigothic gold tremissis coin from the late 6th century was also uncovered along with weights, suggesting that the site was an important base for foreign trade. Another find of an unfinished bronze buckle is being seen as evidence of a metal workshop on the site.

Suffolk County Council began investigations along with the Sutton Hoo Society and English Heritage after illicit treasure hunters with metal detectors targeted fields around Rendlesham in night-time raids in 2009.

After Sir Michael Bunbury alerted the authorities to evidence of the so-called 'night hawks' targeting his land, trusted volunteers with metal detectors were allowed to scan the fields for anything of archaeological value.

Over five years the search uncovered 15 silver Anglo-Saxon coins in one field, including one used as an ornament. Another two Anglo-Saxon sceattas, a type of ancient coin from the 8th century, were found in another field along with silver and copper-alloy brooch fragments. A copy of a 7th century tremissis coin and an 8th century handle-shaped brooch were found in a third area.

Other finds included coins from the Roman era, evidence of an Iron Age enclosure and early medieval trinkets, suggesting the site was occupied for hundreds of years before and after Anglo-Saxon times.

Last night the National Trust confirmed in a statement that the finds represented 'conclusive evidence of the existence of the long-lost Royal settlement at Rendlesham'. A statement said that archaeologists had surveyed 400 acres of land in the search for the settlement.

The investigation identified the 125 acre site by metal-detecting, aerial photography, chemical analysis and geophysics - a process of scanning the ground beneath the surface for evidence of buried features.

The Trust said that finds included 'fragments of exquisite gold jewellery, Saxon pennies and weights associated with trade, and metal offcuts from a smith's workshop'.

The Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History, which helped identify the finds, described them as 'conclusive evidence of the long-lost Anglo-Saxon royal settlement whose people buried their kings at Sutton Hoo'.

A spokesman for the institute described the site as being of 'huge historical and archaeological significance'.

The find has been described as possibly the most significant for Anglo-Saxon history since the 1939 discovery of the burial ship at Sutton Hoo. Investigations of the 27m long ship led
 to the rewriting of Anglo-Saxon history as it emerged that craftsmen 
from the era were much more advanced than previously thought. The treasures found there included included gild and gem-encrusted dress fittings, an ornate ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, as well as pieces of silver plate from Byzantium.

At this new site, while the exact location of the suspected royal palace has not been pinpointed, archaeologists are convinced it would have been there. Bede wrote in his 8th-Century book, An Ecclesiastical History of the English People, that it was 'the king's country-seat of Rendlesham'.

It is believed that in the 7th century the settlement would have equalled Ipswich in size before going into decline two centuries later when Ipswich became the main regional centre.

Mike Argent, chairman of the Sutton Hoo Society, said archaeologists working on the project were 'very excited' about what has been unearthed.

The site of two 6th- and 7th-Century cemeteries, Sutton Hoo's discovery shed light on a period of England's past on the margin between myth, legend and historical documentation.

Use of the site culminated at a time when RÃ¦dwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England.

It is generally thought most likely that he is the person found in the undisturbed ship burial, that held a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts.

Excavated in 1939, the ship is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England. 

The investigations are expected to carry on for at least another year, with much scientific work to be done and the papers detailing the finds still to be written.

Mr Argent said the finds suggested the area was a settlement, meeting place or trading station for a variety of Saxon people including those of high-status, probably kings.

He said the investigations took place around the diary of the working farm, waiting until fields had been harvested, with a team of four authorised and responsible metal detector enthusiasts combing the fields.

'The finds are extremely interesting. They consist of mainly tiny pieces, not the big sparkly stuff discovered at the ship burial,' he added.

'But the finds show there has been human activity at the site over a long period, high status activity. It doesn't confirm one way or another that there was a big royal palace - it doesn't show there was and it doesn't mean there wasn't one.

'It shows there were high-status people at the site and there was trading with places that were very far away. It is fascinating and very exciting.'

Judith Plouviez, lead archaeological officer at Suffolk County Council for the project, said there was an 'exceptional Anglo-Saxon settlement here, and that it was flourishing at the time of Raedwald'.

Sir Michael Bunbury, 67, who owns the land where the settlement has been found, said: 'The area is on a number of fields which are now used for growing wheat, barley and oil seed rape.

'My understanding is that there would have been people leaving here and people of high status, like kings, would visit. It is an on-going scientific and archaeological investigation.'

Richard Smith, the Suffolk County Council cabinet member for Economic Development, Environment and Planning said: 'We are very grateful to Sir Michael Bunbury who alerted us to on-going illicit looting on his land and has allowed the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service and the metal detecting team regular access to his fields.

'From the start it was clear that this site produced exceptionally important finds that could relate to the royal settlement cited in Bede.

'The combination of the exemplary work by the detector users with other survey methods is allowing us to build a detailed picture of past activity, including international trade and fine metalworking.'

Professor Christopher Scull, of Cardiff University and University College London said: 'The survey has identified a site of national and indeed international importance for the understanding of the Anglo-Saxon elite and their European connections.

'The quality of some of the metalwork leaves no doubt that it was made for and used by the highest ranks of society. These exceptional discoveries are truly significant in throwing new light on early East Anglia and the origins of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.'

The National Trust, in conjunction with Suffolk County Council's archaeological service is staging an exhibition of the finds at Rendlesham at the Sutton Hoo visitor centre between March 31 and October 15 this year.

The relics will then move permanently to Ipswich Museum.
