Video footage of an airline pilot, on the run after murdering his girlfriend, stealing a passenger jet and crashing it into an airport terminal building has been released.

Brian Hedglin, 40, went on the rampage in a 50-seat passenger jet at St George Municipal airport in Utah days after stabbing his girlfriend to death in July.

Newly released CCTV video taken at 12.49am on July 17 shows the aircraft bumping up and down as it tears through a car park, knocking down street lamps, security fences and trees before ploughing into rental vehicles, leaving 14 cars damaged.

Another surveillance camera captured 
the moment Hedglin reversed the empty SkyWest plane, which can carry 50 
passengers, away. He then drove the aircraft forwards, clipping the jet 
bridge.

The most spectacular footage shows 
the plane's left wing tearing through a terminal buiding before slamming
into a number of cars.

Hedglin - who worked for Skywest - then shot himself in the cockpit.

Police said Hedglin drove his 
motorbike to the airport, which was closed, and scaled a razor wire 
fence, using a rug for protection.

An officer making routine rounds noticed the rug over the fence and moments later heard the sound of a plane's engine firing up.

On the run: Hedglin (left) was wanted for the murder of his girlfriend, Christina Cornejo (right). He shot himself dead i the aircraft after it had come to a halt

Evidence: The plane was severely damaged in the incident, its left wing completely torn away

Disruption: The Utah airport remained closed to commercial traffic after the incident in July as the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration launched an investigation

He found the craft idling, boarded it
and discovered Hedglin dead, a gunshot wound to his head. A H&K 
semi-automatic pistol was beside his body.

Police said he had a bandage covering
what looked like a stab wound on the right of his chest and a bruise on
the left side of his back.

He was wanted in connection with the death of Christina Cornejo, 39, in Colorado Springs.

Her body was found at his home a few 
days before the hijacking by police doing a welfare check at the request
of her family. She had been stabbed to death.

Hedglin dated Cornejo for four years and was arrested in March after claims he had been harassing her.

Out-of-service: The plane lies in the midst of a pile of rental cars

Clear-up: A crane was used to move the damaged plane

Scene: St George Municipal Airport in Utah, where Hedglin tried to steal the plane

They were both members of the 
Colorado National Guard. Hedglin had served part-time since 2008 as a 
chef and had never been deployed.

Cornejo was full-time, having worked for the Guard since 2006, becoming an officer in 2011.

Hedglin was believed to have been free on $10,000 bail when Cornejo was found dead.

The CRJ200 made by Bombardier is 
capable of flying up to 534 mph with a range of 1,700 miles. Normally it
has a two-person flight crew and a single flight attendant.
