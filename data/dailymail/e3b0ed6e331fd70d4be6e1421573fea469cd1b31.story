A mother-of-two who once weighed 24 stone and hated her size thought her life would be transformed when she had a gastric wrap to help her slim down.

But while the weight loss surgery - similar to having a gastric band - did help Melissa Foreman shed 12st, it didn't leave her with the body of her dreams.

Instead the 44-year-old, who lives in Sidcup, London, was left with rolls of unsightly saggy skin on her thighs and stomach.

She told MailOnline: 'My body looked like a deflated balloon. I was a fraud as my body in clothes didn't match what was underneath, I hated it.' 

Writing in a blog post about her experience, she said she felt 'humiliated' about her appearance and when she saw herself in the mirror, she thought 'there could not be any possible way to come back to anything remotely normal looking'.

Melissa had originally gained weight growing up in California where she couldn't resist sweet treats and fast food.

She said: 'I was a big child who hid food. It was my best friend and worst enemy. I went from a fat child to a fatter teenager to a morbidly obese adult.

'On a typical day, I would skip breakfast. Then lunch could easily consist of two Big Macs and large fries.

'Dinner was large takeaway or home-cooked massive portions of fat-laden foods. Snacking on crisps and biscuits in between. I was easily consuming 5,000 calories a day.'

Melissa hated the saggy skin she was left with on her stomach and thighs after she lost 12st

Now she has a new body after going under the knife again to have 'several pounds' of the skin removed

Melissa's intake of calories was more than double the recommended daily amount for a woman so her weight soared to 24st.  

In 2009 when she was 38 years old, she had twins and said becoming a mother made her realise she had to do something to improve her health. 

'I wanted to be an active mum that could run after them. I already felt at a disadvantage being an older mum. I didn't want to make my life shorter with obesity,' she explained.

Melissa researched her options and decided to travel to the Czech Republic for a developing weight loss surgery called a gastric wrap. 

It involves keyhole surgery to stitch the stomach wall to make it smaller so there is less capacity for food. It works on the same principle as a gastric bypass but is slightly less invasive as a gastric bypass involves a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower pouch, and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both.

Following the surgery, Melissa gradually lost weight over the following 18 months. The surgery meant she couldn't eat as much as she could before and she also started going for more healthy food options. She also started exercising as she felt more comfortable running as she became lighter.

But while she was gradually becoming healthier, she was left with a constant reminder of her obese past thanks to her saggy excess skin.

So she decided to go under the knife once again in order to have it removed by cosmetic surgeon Paul Baguley.

She said: 'The process was done in two stages over three months. The recovery was hard as I was covered in staples and stitches. But, it was not nearly as bad I thought it would be. The pain was worth it. Through plastic surgery I could have the body I worked so hard to get.

'Like a magic wand being run across my body, the evidence of my obesity was erased. Mr Baguley removed several pounds of skin. Where it had creped, my body is now taut and contoured.'

Melissa now weighs 11st 5lb and is happy to show off her figure on her blog as she writes to support other people trying to deal with weight and self-esteem issues.

She said: 'The new me can run, the new me will live longer and the new me can do anything! I have been extremely lucky that with the intervention of an amazing surgeon, I could be brand new.

'Now in retrospect looking at my pictures (when I had saggy skin), particularly my thighs and stomach, the results are unbelievable. I am not ashamed of those pictures any more. It is a bit like looking at a discarded cocoon now. 

'Although not perfect, I am very happy with the butterfly I have become no matter how oddly I fly now and then.'
