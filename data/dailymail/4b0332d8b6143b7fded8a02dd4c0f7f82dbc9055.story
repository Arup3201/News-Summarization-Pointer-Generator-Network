Row: Prosecutors believe text messages on the Olympic sprinter's phone will prove the couple were having an argument on the night of the shooting

Oscar Pistorius has ‘forgotten’ the four-digit passcode needed to unlock a mobile phone he was using on the night he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

Police have been forced to seek help from Apple in America to try to gain access to an iPhone 5 found on the floor of the bathroom in which the model was shot dead by Pistorius.

The 26-year-old South African athlete, known as ‘Blade Runner’ because of his distinctive prosthetic limbs, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, 29, and prosecutors believe his phone contains vital evidence.

The phone, along with three others, was found on the bathroom floor of his Pretoria home early on Valentine’s Day after Pistorius had shot and killed Reeva.

Lieutenant General Vineshkumar Moonoo, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Pistorius is saying he can’t remember the code and we have been unable to access messages sent or received that night.

‘These could be crucial and Apple executives in America have made their technicians available to help us. 

‘I cannot say Pistorius’s memory failure is suspicious but the mobile phones were clearly in use up to the time of the killing.’ During the court hearing at which Pistorius was released on bail in March, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said examination of the mobile phones was vital. 

Mr Nel said detectives had found four mobile phones on the bathroom floor: two BlackBerries and two iPhones. 

Their position in the bathroom, close to the shower cubicle, could be evidence that the couple had a furious row during which Reeva had locked herself in.

Trial: Pistorius will appear in court in August to face charges of murder. Information on his mobile phone is said to be crucial to the prosecution's case

Champion: Pistorius was feted as a Paralympic and Olympic legend before his arrest in February. He had only been dating Reeva Steenkamp for a few months before the shooting

Pistorius, who competed at the London
Olympics last year against able-bodied athletes, told the court he had 
thought she was an intruder when he fired four shots from a handgun 
through the door.

Three hit Reeva and she bled to death.

Pistorius will next appear in Pretoria Magistrates’ Court on August 19.

Text
messages, together with a ballistics examination of the toilet cubicle 
and door, are believed to be the two pivotal elements of the 
prosecution’s case.

Beauty: Miss Steenkamp, 29 was a model and television presenter. She was shot three times at Pistorius' home
