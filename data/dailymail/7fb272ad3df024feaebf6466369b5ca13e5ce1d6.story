Thania Sayne was pregnant with her second child when her husband, a sergeant in the U.S. Army, was killed in Afghanistan.

The Effingham, Illinois, mother wept at her husband's grave on Wednesday, the day before what would have been the couple's third wedding anniversary. 

Two years after Sergeant Timothy Sayne 
was buried at Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, his widow has revealed she
 still doesn't know how to tell her young son that his father will never
 be coming home.

Mrs Sayne gave birth to the couple's second son, Douglas, a few months after her 31-year-old husband was killed in a bomb attack in Afghanistan's Kandahar province on September 18, 2011.

'It was really hard. There’s no words to explain what it was like not having him next to me,' she told the Effingham Daily News a few months after her husband's death.

She said yesterday that she still doesn't know how to tell her little boy, who will turn two in January, that his father was killed in action.

But she is keen to keep her husband's memory alive, saying that despite her overwhelming grief she is proud of what he did for his country.

'He always wanted to serve his country and protect us, and for that I am proud, but I’m also angry because he’s not here,' she said.

The widow said that although visiting her husband's graveside is emotional, she finds solace from the other families at the cemetery.

'There was a comfort in knowing I’m not the only one this happened to. There’s other single moms and kids without daddies and other wives without husbands and other moms without sons,' she said.

She added that Sergeant Sayne had requested to be buried at Arlington after showing his wife old movies of fallen heroes being carried to the cemetery by horse-drawn hearses.

Mrs Sayne's latest visit to Arlington coincided with the national cemetery easing restrictions it had recently imposed on mementos being left on soldiers' graves.

A spokesman for the cemetery said small mementos and photographs will now be allowed to be left in memory of fallen servicemen and women.

Staff at the graveyard had recently cleared personal tributes from headstones, saying they weren't in keeping with the cemetery's policies.

But, after grieving relatives who have lost loved ones in recent conflicts complained, Arlington announced it would ease its rules.

Tribute: The widow is trying to keep her husband's memory alive by sharing stories about him with their sons

Mrs Sayne tries to keep her husband's memory alive by sharing stories with her sons about their time together.

The couple's oldest son, Timothy Kalvin, remembers his father. When he was 20 months old he would point at pictures of Sergeant Sayne and kiss them.

Since losing her husband, Mrs Sayne and the couple's sons have moved in with her mother-in-law, Kathy, who says she has been helped through her grief by having the family with her.
