It's not exactly the sort of father-son moment most parents dream of. But Arkansas governor Mike Beebe took a moment to reflect how much his son had grown up - after agreeing to pardon him for a marijuana conviction

The pardon stems from Kyle Beebe's felony conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver in 2003, when his dad was serving as the state's attorney general.

Outgoing governor Beebe said the reason the pardon had taken so long was because his son, who is now 34, had not requested it until now.

'I would have done it a long time ago if he'd have asked, but he took his sweet time about asking,' the governor told KATV. 'He's still embarrassed, and frankly, I was embarrassed and his mother was embarrassed.

'All of the families that go through that. It's tough on the families, but hopefully the kids learn.'

Kyle was given fined following the conviction and given three years supervised probation, which he completed in 2006.

Governor Beebe told the news station Kyle was no different from other kids who do 'stupid stuff' when they are young and he has grown up since then. 

'His mother and I were stereotypical parents from the different end of the spectrum, he said. 'She was the enabler that tried to fix everything. 

'I was the nuclear bomb thrower that thought you ought to shoot him. Somewhere between those two extremes was probably the right thing to do.'

In Arkansas, a pardon restores the rights of an individual after a felony conviction, including  the right to bear arms.

Governor Beebe says he has issued than 700 pardons, mostly of non-violent offenders.

He said: 'Especially young people with drugs if they've straightened up, to get their life back on track and have a second chance, so this is no different.'

In a pardon application letter to his father Kyle Beebe wrote: 'I am asking for a second chance to be a better son to my parents and prove to them that I am the person they raised me to be.

'At the time of my arrest I was living in a fantasy world, not reality. I was young and dumb. 

'At that time in my life I felt like I was missing something and I tried to fill that emptiness by selling drugs.'

A spokesman for the Arkansas Parole Board told KATV that Kyle Beebe 'did not receive any special treatment by the Board while his application was under consideration'.

Mike Beebe has served two terms as governor of Arkansas after being elected in 2006. He will leave office at the end of this year because of term limits to be replaced by Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman and Drug Enforcement Administration administrator.
