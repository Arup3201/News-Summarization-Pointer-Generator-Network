A postcard and a calendar from 1974 may finally prove a pensioner's claim that there has been a mix-up over the true identity of the model in Athena's famous 'Tennis Girl' poster.

Photographer Martin Elliot always credited model Fiona Butler, his then girlfriend, as starring in the dream-like photograph taken on a sunny day in 1976. 

But Peter Atkinson has for 30 years claimed the bare bum in the picture, which became famous in the 1980s and decorated a generation of boys' bedrooms, in fact belonged to his ex-wife.

And now, he says, he has found proof.  

The Tennis Girl: Athena's famous poster of a young woman bearing her bottom on a sun-soaked tennis court became one of the most-famous images in the world during the late 1970s and the 1980s 

Controversy: But Peter Atkinson, a pensioner from Marsh Gate, Cornwall, claims the woman credited with being the model in the photograph, Fiona Butler, is wrong and that it in fact shows his ex-wife

'Fiona [Butler] has always said she had a photo shoot with her knickers off with Martin,' said Mr Atkinson. 'She thinks that the photo shoot they had was the one that was used - that's not the case.'

Exhibit A is a postcard Mr Atkinson bought off eBay showing the Tennis Girl picture, but stamped with a 1974 postmark - two years before Mr Elliot claims he shot the photograph.

Exhibit B is a 1974 calendar unearthed by the pensioner. It is illustrated with a photograph so similar to the Tennis Girl shot it seems likely they could have been taken during the same shoot.

The 72-year-old also claims that Mr Elliot, who died of cancer in 2010, had confessed to him in a meeting that Ms Butler is not the real Tennis Girl.

'Fiona was photographed by Martin Elliot, but that was years after the initial photo was taken,' Mr Atkinson said. 

'Initially Martin photographed my ex-wife, and tried to flog it to the poster manufacturer Athena.

'Athena weren't interested to begin with, but eventually they came back to him and commissioned him to take the photo properly and lent him some professional gear.'

Exhibit A: Mr Atkinson claims to have bought this postcard from eBay. Postmarked 1974, it nevertheless shows the unmistakable Tennis Girl image, which by the photographer's account wasn't taken until 1976

Exhibit B: This 1974 calendar shows what appears to be another photograph from the same set as the Tennis Girl shot, which Mr Atkinson says is further evidence that the iconic photo was in fact a picture of his ex

Mr Atkinson says Mr Elliot did indeed recreate the original shoot four years later with Ms Butler, who was then 18 and the photographer's girlfriend. But the image that went global and adorned boys' walls around the world was from the original set, insists Mr Atkinson, and shows his ex-wife.

A best-seller throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Athena's Tennis Girl poster a worldwide impact. It was banned in several countries and even publicly torn to pieces in the Middle East as an example of Western sexual decadence.

The girl in the photo, which remains popular to this day, remained anonymous until 1989, when Fiona Butler stepped forward to announce that she was the face behind the behind.

Mr Elliot's story is that the shot was taken at the now defunct Birmingham University courts at Edgbaston on a hazy September afternoon in 1976. Chewed tennis balls belonging to Miss Butler's dog were scattered across the court.

Mr Elliott went on to sell the image rights to Athena but retained the copyright, earning him an estimated £250,000 in royalty payments. Two million copies were sold worldwide. 

Miss Butler, who is now Mrs Walker and a mother-of-three, has previously said she had no regrets about posing for the photograph, even though she never earned a penny from it. 

But Mr Atkinson believes she had been misled by Mr Elliot.

He says his ex-wife, to whom he was married between 1980 and 1986, revealed to him during their relationship that she had posed for the photograph while working as a tennis coach.

Mr Elliot, one of her pupils, talked her into posing for him in a photo shoot in 1972, he says.

His ex-wife wishes to remain anonymous, apparently because it was her word against the late Mr Elliot's, who had always refused to publicly acknowledge Mr Atkinson's claims.

But before his death five years ago, Mr Elliot met the pensioner, who lives near Camelford, Cornwall, and allegedly admitted he had been lying. 

'He confessed i to me - but I can't prove it,' Mr Atkinson said. 'He said that he would give it me in writing, on a postcard, but it never arrived.'

Since Mr Elliot's death the royalties for the poster have been paid to his widow, Noelle Bott.

The late photographer has previously said of the image: 'If I had a pound for ever model that has laid claim to being the girl, and every photographer that has claimed they took the photo, I'd be a very rich man.'
