Conman: Adam Loveridge, 41, persuaded a vulnerable 64-year-old her porch and guttering needed fixing - and charged her £49,000

A gypsy who charged a blind pensioner almost £50,000 for work worth just £1,000 has been jailed.

Adam Loveridge, 41, cold-called at his victim's home and persuaded her that her porch and guttering needed fixing.

He then billed the 64 year-old for a staggering £49,000 - which she began paying in installments.

Over a year she paid out an extortionate £40,080 to Loveridge in a series of cheques until her bank became suspicious and contacted the police.

Loveridge initially claimed he could not read the amounts on the cheques because of his illiteracy but he eventually admitted six counts of fraud.

The conman, who lives on a caravan park in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, blew all but £3,000 of the money on gambling machines.

Loveridge admitted six counts of fraud and was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Peterborough Crown Court.

Recorder Richard Carey told him: 'What you did was to charge obscene amounts.

'You targeted a vulnerable victim and rejoiced in her money for more than a year.'

Hugh Vass, prosecuting, said: 'Loveridge took £40,080 but he would have taken £9,000 more if the bank had not stopped payments.

'The victim is the stereotype vulnerable victim. She is a 69-year-old lady who lives alone and is totally blind.

'Loveridge cold called at her home and pressurised her into having work done.

'But being blind she could not see if the work had been completed or not.'

Mr Vass said a surveyor visited the victim's house in Peterborough and concluded the work Loveridge did was worth no more than £1,000.

Neil Corre, defending, claimed Loveridge had shown genuine empathy for his victim by pleading guilty.

Peter Stonely, from Peterborough Trading Standards, said: 'The best advice we can give to elderly and vulnerable residents is never to deal with people who cold call at the doorstep.'
