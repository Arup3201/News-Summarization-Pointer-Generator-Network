This is the moment a motorist speeds down a two-lane highway using the sidewalk instead of the road.

YouTube user Joey1211 said he spotted the incident on Monday around 2pm  in Largo, Florida.

Footage captured by his friend shows a driver veering on to a wide walkway without stopping. Luckily, there aren't any pedestrians in the way.

There doesn't appear to be a reason for the driver's move as there is no traffic or accident blocking the main road.

When the confused motorist reaches a junction she steers off the sidewalk and back to the road - where she should be driving.

The driver was identified as a woman but the car's plate number was not taken down.

Joey1211 described the incident as 'crazy'.

Under Florida law and most other states, it is illegal to drive a car on sidewalks.

Regulations state: 'A person may not drive any vehicle other than by human power upon a bicycle path, sidewalk, or sidewalk area, except upon a permanent or duly authorized temporary driveway.

'A violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a moving violation.'

The statute does not apply to motorized wheelchairs.
