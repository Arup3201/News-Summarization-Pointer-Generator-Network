There are certain qualities that make anyone appear attractive and all reduce to this simple equation: if you love sex and love people, you're probably sexy.

All of us have a subconscious 'sexy' radar which automatically tunes in to people who've got 'it'. Our looks radar sets off first - instantly scanning for the best-looking person in the crowd - then the sexy radar clicks in, looking for more subtle (and surer) indicators that someone's worth talking to.

Score all six of the following and it's guaranteed you're the girl getting the most attention - and guess what, it's really not about what you look like!

Tracey says that showing enthusiasm is a great way to keep a guy's attention

YOU'RE ENTHUSIASTIC

Enthusiasm is infectious - you can't help but smile and respond to someone who's full of life.

It doesn't really matter what it is you're passionate about, so long as you're throwing your arms around and getting excited about something.

As one guy put it, 'The girl in the corner whose facial expression doesn't change and talks in a monotone isn't appealing, even if she's sprouting all her sexual secrets. It's the girl who's gesturing madly and talking a million miles an hour who you want. Even if she's discussing what colour to paint her bathroom.'

YOU MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM

Orlando Bloom just walked in, Jon Hamm is at the next table shirtless and the waiter just dropped a Â£100 bill at your feet but your eyes haven't moved from his face.

The person who looks you directly in the eye, really listens, calls you by name and focuses on what you're saying wins every time.

Tracey suggests keeping his gaze to make him feel like the only man in the room

YOU'RE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE

A person who isn't scared to express an opinion even if it's the opposite to everyone else's, might be called opinionated, stroppy or even rude, but there's one thing they'll never be branded - boring.

Stick up for your beliefs and believe in yourself.

We all respect and admire people who hold their head up and fight their own battles.

YOU'RE NOT SCARED TO TOUCH

Never, ever underestimate the power of touch.

The person who really hugs hello, who puts a concerned hand on your arm if you're upset, gives a firm handshake to say, 'Congratulations!' is making warm, sexy gestures that make them seem approachable.

Tracey says a strong personality, even a moody or stroppy one, is far better than being boring

Don't forget to touch yourself too.

Smoothing your stockings, pushing back your hair, hugging yourself if you're a bit cold - it's all very sensual and inviting and draws attention to whatever body part you're touching.

If you're stingy with your affection, others assume you're cold, hard to get to know, uptight.None of which are adjectives you want applied to you, right?

YOU'RE AWARE OF YOUR BODY - AND KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT OFF

The more you like your body, the better you'll present it to the world.

Sit with your arms crossed, clutching a pillow across your stomach and the message is obvious: I feel fat and I'm trying to hide my stomach.

A woman who does a big, lazy stretch, lifting her arms up, sends a very different message: I'm proud of my body.

YOU'RE NOT LOOKS OBSESSED

It's hard to accept someone will find you sexy with a red wine stained mouth, mascara down your cheeks and hair askew but you'll still look a better than the girl who spends all night staring into her mirror.

One reason why the just-got-out-of-bed tousled look never, ever goes out of fashion!
