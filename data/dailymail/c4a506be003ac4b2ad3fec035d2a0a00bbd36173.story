Their moves probably wouldn't cut the mustard on Strictly Come Dancing.

But an impromptu dance routine performed by these three police officers received a rousing reception at the Notting Hill Carnival.

Wearing high-visibility jackets over their uniforms, each officer busted their dance moves on a west London street on Sunday evening.

Getting into the festival spirit: Crowds begin to gather as the officers start their routine

Throwing shapes: The police officers then start bumping and grinding on the corner of the west London street

Getting down: One of the police officers ended up flat on his back during the choreographed routine

Egged on by hundreds of revellers, they then sat in a line on the floor and performed a synchronised 'rowing boat' dance routine.

At the end of the dance they leapt to their feet and punched the air with delight as the crowd cheered and laughed.

A video of the routine called Notting Hill Carnival 2013 Police Dance Off was posted on YouTube. By yesterday evening it had been viewed thousands of times.

An officer called PC Armstrong posted a link to the video on Twitter with the caption: 'good community relations in my opinion'.

Style points: What these officers lack in style and execution of their moves they more than make up when they perform the 'rowing boat' dance routine

Busting some moves: The three men looked like they thoroughly enjoyed doing the 'row the boat' dance

The revellers who watched the dance routine were among the one million-strong crowd who attended Europe's largest street party.

The two-day event, which is in its 49th year, provided its usual colourful mix of Caribbean culture, food, music and dance.

Scotland Yard deployed 6,000 officers at the carnival on Sunday and made 279 arrests over the two day celebrations.
