One of Britain’s youngest horse riders will make his debut at a prestigious national event this week - aged just three.

Talented Harry Edwards-Brady will be watched by thousands of people when he takes to the stage at this year’s Horse of the Year Show (HOYS).

The tot only began riding earlier this year but is already well on his way to becoming an expert rider.

Celebrations: Harry Edwards-Brady qualifies for the Horse of the Year show

Harry, who has already won an impressive four best rider titles at local shows, has qualified two different ponies for the event.

He stunned crowds at a HOYS heat with a near-perfect score in July this year.

Judges at the Royal Norfolk Show awarded him 48 out of 50 marks for his performance atop four-year-old Dartmoor pony Divine.

Harry’s other pony, Gryngallt Page Too, is also aged just four and only launched his showing career at the start of this season.

And the toddler is hoping to become one of the youngest ever winners when he makes his national debut at Birmingham NEC.

Proud mum Emma, from Hatherleigh, Devon, said Harry was not intimidated despite the age of him and his horses.

She said: 'I think I’ll probably be leading the youngest combination in both classes.

'Harry’s really excited now. Although he’s only three I think it’s sunk in that it’s quite an important show.'

Natural talent: But Harry says he still finds time to enjoy the same things as other children his age

Despite his natural horse-riding ability, Harry said he still finds time to enjoy the same things as other children his age.

He said: 'My favourite things are rides on tractors, finger painting and ice-cream.'

Harry will compete in the mountain and moorland lead-rein of the year final with Divine.

He will also ride Gryngallt Page Too in the lead-rein pony of hunter type class.

HOYS runs from October 9 to 13.
