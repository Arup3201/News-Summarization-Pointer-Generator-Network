The Australian parents of a toddler with an aggressive brain tumour who were forced to fly to the US for life-saving treatment costing $200,000 say they still haven't received any funding from the Federal Government.

Edwin Ho, wife Rochelle Luk and their son Edric have now returned to their home in Perth after flying to the US in May for targeted proton beam therapy, which is not available in Australia.

Little Edric looked happy to be home as he crawled across the airport floor giggling after the family got off the plane.

His parents previously accused the Government of refusing to fund Edric's much needed treatment because of budget cuts.

Smiling again: Edric has returned from the US after having life-saving treatment for his aggressive brain tumour

This week they told Channel Seven they are still waiting for help despite the treatment being successful.

'We feel disappointed we didn't get any funding but we're still fighting,' Mr Ho said as the family arrived at Perth airport.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Department of Health for comment.

In May, Edric's parents claimed the therapy was their toddler's best chance of survival.

However, the Government said he should have the more standard treatment that is already available in Australia.

The family said pleas for funding from the Federal Health Department's Medical Treatment Overseas Program had been rejected.

They were forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told previously Daily Mail Australia that the decision not to fund the overseas treatment came from a 'preliminary assessment which at this stage denies the treatment'.

'One of the main criteria for treatment overseas is that it can't be performed in Australia. Patients with the same condition are currently being treated in Australia,' she said.

'If doctors or the family can come back with further information before a final decision is made then it will be considered.'

However, the family claim the conformal photon radiotherapy treatment being offered to them in Australia has 'horrible side effects'.   

Little Edric, who previously had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation, has also been recommended for the special treatment abroad by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

He is suffering from an anaplastic ependymoma - a tumour that forms when cells in the central nervous system (in his case the brain) begin to multiple rapidly.

'It was devastating': Edric's mother Rochelle said finding out her son was sick was 'every parent's worst nightmare'

The experts said the best treatment for Edric was unavailable in Australia and other treatments delivered much bigger areas of low dose radiation to brain tissue that could be harmful.

Describing the moment they found out Edric was seriously ill, his father Edwin told Seven News: 'He was normal one week and paralysed the next.'

At 18-months, he stopped walking and lost the use of his right hand.

'It was devastating. It was the worst nightmare of a parent,' his mother Rochelle said.

The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia so far - the Sir Charles Gairdner and Princess Margaret hospitals - said they would appeal against the decision not to fund his overseas treatment.
