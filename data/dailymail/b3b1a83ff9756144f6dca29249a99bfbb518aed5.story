Prime Minister Tony Abbott has abandoned a plan to cut the $20 Medicare rebate for short consultations.

Health Minister Sussan Ley  announced the back-down on Thursday after the government faced immense pressure from doctors and opposition MPs.

Ms Ley said she was deeply concerned by misinformation causing confusion for patients and confusion for doctors about the changes.

'As a result, I'm announcing today that the changes to level A and B Medicare consultation items will not commence on Monday as planned,' she told reporters in Melbourne.

'The government is taking them off the table.'

'I have heard, I have listened and I have decided to take this action now,' the minister said, after breaking her holiday to address the issue.

However, she insisted it remained critical that there should be reform to ensure the Medicare system has a sustainable future to give quality care.

The minister made a strong commitment to undertake a wide ranging consultation on the ground with doctors and the community to come up with sensible options.

'I need to explain ... that our Medicare system is growing at a rapid and unsustainable rate.'

The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, would have seen Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19

Earlier, Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler wrote to Mr Abbott urging him to intervene to overturn the plan to cut by $20.10 the rebate paid to GPs for consultations under 10 minutes.

Doctors said the measure would lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs.

Labor, the Greens and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the Senate returns on February 9.

'It was never a good idea, and Mr Abbott should take this opportunity to ditch it and instead consult with the medical profession on how to support quality primary healthcare,' Associate Professor Owler said on Thursday.

Doctors said the measure would lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs 

Earlier in the day, Small Business Minister Bruce Billson said the government would push on with the important reform to discourage doctors from practising so-called six-minute medicine.

'We'll continue to make the case that this reform is necessary. It is thoughtful, it is prudent. This change is on the table. It is being implemented,' Mr Billson told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.

'It is an important measure and there are no alternatives being advocated by anybody.'

His comments followed a statement on Wednesday from Ms Ley, who accused Labor of playing politics with the issue.

'Without reform, Medicare will collapse under its own weight and jeopardise the world-class, affordable healthcare Australians take for granted,' her statement said.

Labor, the Greens and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the Senate returns on February 9 

Medicare has paid $37.05 towards short visits for years, and the plan was to cut that amount to $16.95.

Critics said the change would prompt doctors to stop bulk billing these shorter consultations and start charging patients to cover costs.

The Abbott government also scrapped its plan for a $7 Medicare co-payment before Christmas.

Instead, an optional co-payment would be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. 

Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July.
