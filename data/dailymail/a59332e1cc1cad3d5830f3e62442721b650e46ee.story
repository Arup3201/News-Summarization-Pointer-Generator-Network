There's is just no stopping Myleene Klass.

How the 35-year-old mother of two, classically trained musician and whizz-kid astronomer manages to find time to brush her hair is a wonder, let alone design multiple fashion collections and stay in good enough shape to model them while doing it.

But, as she unveils a new collection of lingerie for Littlewoods - and models it herself - it is clear that the (rather nubile) force of nature that is Myleene really is completely unstoppable.

Dialling up the heat in 50¿s style lingerie, Myleene proves she is the perfect ambassador for her designs modelling her third collection of bralets and high-waisted knickers featuring lace detailing and sheer panels

The latest string to her bow is her a collection of bras, knickers, suspenders and bodies, part of her third lingerie line for the brand, for which she has previously designed a collection of dresses and swimwear.

Dialling up the heat in 50’s style 
lingerie, Myleene proves she is the perfect ambassador for her designs 
modelling bralets and high-waisted knickers featuring lace detailing and
sheer panels.

The items range in price from £12 to £34 and have the sort of retro, pin-up girl detailing that have become Myleene's hallmark: high waists, sheer panelling and lots of lace.

Great shape: Myleene, 35, shows off her impressive figure in the retro range, which ranges from £12 to £34

Posing seductively in the Fifties-style lingerie, Myleene - who was announced as Style Ambassador for the brand in July 2012 - is, as Littlewoods says, the 'perfect ambassador'.

Littlewoods.com spokesman Gary Kibble said Myleene's versatile designs are always popular with the store's customers.

'Myleene’s lingerie designs enable women to add a touch of glamour to their wardrobes,' he said today. 'There are designs to suit all shapes.'

Myleene Klass, who has two daughters with ex-husband Graham Quinn, also designs womenswear and nightwear collection for the online retailer.

Getting a leg up: Myleene already has a successful fashion range available at Littlewoods as well as a collection of swimwear
