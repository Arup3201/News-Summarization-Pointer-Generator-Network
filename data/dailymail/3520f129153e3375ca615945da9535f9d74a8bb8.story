Welcome to the Cliff Corridor, a spectacular mountain road cut through a 110m high cliff face that serves as the only access link to a small Chinese Village.

The 1250m-long road which runs through mountains in Huixian County in central Chinaâ€™s Henan Province, was chiseled and hammered out 40 years ago by 14 villagers from Guoliang village.

The corridor is 5m high and 4m wide, and winds along the cliff at 110 meters high.

Take the high road: The 1,250m long 'cliff corridor' connects Guoliang village in Henan Province China to the outside world

Careful driver: A car makes its way along the cliff corridor which is the only access to the mountainous village in central China

Almost 40 years ago, the only 
connection between Guoliang village and the outside world was a 
gruelling, almost vertical set of 720 mountain steps.

The stairs were very dangerous because they were steep, narrow and had no handrails.

Then
in 1972 village head Shen Mingxin decided something had to be done and 
led 13 villagers in a mammoth effort to chisel and hammer a real road to
the outside.

Without use of any machinery, they created the cliff corridor purely by hand.

It
took the 14 villagers 5 years to complete the corridor, which is wide 
enough to be driven along, during which time they used up more than 10 
tons of drill rods and 4,000 hammers.

Before the road was built in the mid 1970s the only access to the village was an almost vertical set of 720 mountain steps. The corridor is 5m high and 4m wide, and winds along the cliff at 110 meters high

Feat: The 1250m-long corridor was chiseled and hammered out 40 years ago by just 14 villagers from Guoliang village

Effort: It took the 14 villagers five years to complete the corridor, which is wide enough to be driven along

Long way home: A pedestrian trudges up the 1,250m cliff corridor, one of the world's most spectacular roads

Members of Guoliang village take part in an outdoor art class. Their only link to the outside world is the cliff corridor which was built purely by hand

Journey's end: It took 14 villagers 5 years to complete the corridor, which is wide enough to be driven along, during which time they used up more than 10 tons of drill rods and 4,000 hammers
