Stoke City forward Bojan Krkic has been handed a huge boost after it emerged he will be able to return to training in just over three months time.

Initial scans indicated that he would be out of action for up to six months after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury in Stoke's 4-1 victory at Rochdale in the FA Cup.

However, Sportsmail understands that subsequent tests have demonstrated that although the anterior cruciate ligament suffered damage, the meniscus and the two lateral ligaments have not been adversely affected.

It is now understood that Krkic will be able to return to training in May and he is hoping to be in prime condition on the first day of pre-season.

He will still miss the remainder of this campaign but fears that he may also be absent for the beginning of next season have been eased. He will now miss only three months of competitive action.

The forward, who had been in outstanding form before suffering the injury, now requires a more minor operation than had been initially feared.

He will be operated on in the Deixus hospital in Barcelona and he will then begin his recuperation in Catalonia.

The clinic is located very close to his home in Barcelona, where he will be near his family.
