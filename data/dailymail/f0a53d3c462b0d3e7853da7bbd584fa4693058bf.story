An 8-year-old boy crawling through a space in an automatic gate died Tuesday after being crushed by the metal arm that opens the entryway to the suburban Las Vegas housing community where he lived.

The arm that controls the gate moves back and forth in the space measuring 7 inches tall and nearly 3 feet wide that Matthew Cattlet was known to play in. 

Cattlet was trying to crawl through the horizontal opening designed to allow the arm of the gate to pass through when the gate swings open, police said in a statement.  

Freak accident: Matthew Cattlet, 8, was crushed by the metal arm that opens this gate in Las Vegas

No child's play:  Matthew was trying to crawl through this horizontal opening in a gate measuring 7 inches tall and 3 feet wide - something he's been known to do 

He was struck after another child on a bicycle approached the gate Tuesday afternoon, inadvertently triggering a motion sensor for it to move, North Las Vegas police spokeswoman Chrissie Coon said.

His official cause of death is pending, the Clark County coroner's office said Wednesday.

A teenager who saw the bar hit the boy called 911 around 5.30pm, reporting that Matthew was lodged in the gate at the Village at Craig Ranch and suffered a severe injury, Coon said. 

Other children between the ages of 8 and 14 playing nearby also witnessed the freak accident and have spoken to police.

'Reportedly, this young child frequently crawls through the space in the gate. He was trying to crawl through the arm of the gate but he couldn't get out in time and the arm of the gate crushed him,' Coon said.

Matthew was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he died from his injuries.

It is protocol to notify child protective services of the incident, but police say they don't suspect criminal negligence.

'It appears just to be a tragic accident,' Coon said.
