Gus Poyet says the ‘exceptional’ Lee Cattermole set an example of how to combat Chelsea’s star-studded midfield during their goalless draw at the Stadium of Light.

The Sunderland anchorman was man-of-the-match as the Black Cats became only the third team to take points from Jose Mourinho’s side this season.

Cattermole – who on Sunday collects the North East Football Writers’ Player of the Year award – was imperious as he out-fought the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic and unsettled the creative flair of Eden Hazard and Oscar.

And Poyet said: ‘What he did, Lee Cattermole, was an example of how you need to play in the middle of the park against a top team.

‘When you need to go for a tackle, when you need to cover, when you need to follow someone, when you need to go deep, when you need to go higher, when you make a foul, even that. Sometimes it’s needed, and he was exceptional.

‘I’m sure he is going to go home feeling that his role in the team is very important, and he is recognised today by defending and being a leader in terms of defending.’

Poyet, meanwhile, was thrilled with his side’s resilience.

‘To have the chance to get something from a team like Chelsea, first you need to defend,’ he said.

‘You need to defend properly and you need to make it very difficult and you need to be a team, organised, shape, throwing bodies in front of the ball, and have everything you need to do to play a football game against one of the best teams, and we did that.

‘That’s the beginning, that’s the minimum. The other side, the chances – at the end, they were coming because there was space and we were enjoying it, the fans were loving it.’
