Argentina has launched a vitriolic attack on the British Government in response to criticism over its provocative Olympic advert filmed on the Falkland Islands.

Last week, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called on Argentina to  apologise for the advert, which was filmed secretly and shows an athlete using a British war memorial in his training.

But yesterday, after several days of silence, the Argentine government hit back, accusing Britain of killing and maiming innocent civilians.

Spat: Argentine Foreign Secretary Hector Timmerman accused Defence Minister Phillip Hammond of being a 'thug' during his savage attack on Britain over the Falklands

Disagreement: Mr Hammond had recently called on Argentina to apologise for an advert in which it laid claim to the Falklands

Its reply, in a 1,000-word press 
release titled ‘Let’s Honour The Dead By Building Peace’, was a bitter 
assault on Mr Hammond, the British Government and Britain’s record on 
human rights.

Argentina’s foreign secretary, Hector 
Timerman, claimed Mr Hammond ‘ought to know the world is a safer place 
when you use creativity instead of bombing civilians in independent 
countries’.

He added: ‘Britain’s Defence Minister 
[sic] demands, like a mighty knight, that Argentina expresses its regret
for the creativity of an advert which sums up what we feel. He has 
still not explained what punishment he will select if we refuse to obey 
his demands.’

Argentina’s claim of sovereignty over 
the Falkland Islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, have been renewed 
recently surrounding the 30th anniversary its invasion of the islands on
April 2, 1982.

In his response, Mr Timerman condemned
the British Government’s refusal to enter negotiations over the 
islands’ future.

He said: ‘Nothing is more disrespectful with the memory
of those who lost their lives on the battlefield than the shameful 
decision to block the progress of peace.’

Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Fernando Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run

Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, the athlete in the Argentinian Falklands ad jogs past the office of the Penguin News, a weekly Falkland Islands newspaper

The advert was shot secretly by an 
international ad agency and sold to the Argentine government, which has 
screened it dozens of times on national TV.

In the advert, Argentine 
hockey player Fernando Zylberberg was shown doing step-ups on the 
Falklands’ Great War Memorial, which honours British sailors who died 
battling the German fleet in 1914.

It also shows him running past the 
office of Falklands newspaper The Penguin News and doing arm-raises 
outside Port Stanley’s Globe Tavern.

It ends with the slogan: ‘To 
compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.’

Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Olympic hopeful Fernando Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley

Pointed message: With the rugged countryside in the background: 'To compete on English soil'

The advert provoked a furious reaction
from the British Government, Falkland Islands authorities and Falklands
War veterans, including Simon Weston who branded it an ‘insult’.

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of
advertising giant WPP, which part owns the agency which created the 
advert, has condemned it as ‘totally unacceptable’.

Mr Timerman, who has previously 
blasted British 'imperial decadence', claimed Britain’s ‘Defence 
Minister’ spent his days controlling the mass of  ‘poor’ British 
soldiers sent to fight ‘rich men’s’ wars.
