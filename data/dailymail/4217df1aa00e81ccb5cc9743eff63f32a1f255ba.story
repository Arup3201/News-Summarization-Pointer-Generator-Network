They are the billion dollar couple whose marriage has been a carefully orchestrated affair - even down to the announcement of their first child live on TV.

But as rumors continue to swirl surrounding an impending split between Jay Z and Beyoncé, sources tell MailOnline the rapper is desperate to save his marriage and plans to whisk his superstar wife away on a five-week 'make or break' vacation in between their final tour dates.

A source revealed that Jay Z is trying to persuade Beyoncé - who is now looking at apartments in both New York AND LA - to join him, saying: 'Jay wants to save the marriage, they have their final US tour date in San Francisco on August 6 and then they have two dates in Paris from September 12 - that's it.

'He adores his daughter Blue Ivy and he wants a sibling for her, but Beyoncé isn't sure what she wants to do  - their marriage is in flux, that's the truth. Jay just wants them to spend some time alone together to try and work it out.

The end of the fairytale?  Beyoncé looked emotional as she donned a white wedding gown while performing at Safeco Field in Seattle with husband Jay Z on Wednesday night

Separate lives: Jay Z is said to be desperate to save his marriage to  Beyoncé  - and wants to whisk her away for a make or break vacation. The couple put on a good show in Seattle on Wednesday night

Smiles: Despite their grins as last night's gig, Beyoncé still changed the lyrics of her song, Resentment, further fueling rumors of marital strife - and is not wearing a wedding ring (ringed)

'And it's not just throwing away a marriage - it's throwing away a brand. But it may be that Bey has just had enough. She has some trust issues with Jay.'

The couple are currently on the West Coast on their On The Run Tour, from which they stand to earn up to $120 million.

The source said their marriage has not been the same since they became parents and settled down to family life with their daughter, now two. The stress is said to have led them to a point where Beyoncé yet again hinted at marital strife.

At their concert at Seattle's Safeco Field on Wednesday night,  she once more changed the lyrics to her 2006 song, Resentment - and was clearly seen without a wedding band.

During the song, which is about a cheating scandal, she altered the track to reflect the current length of her romance with the rapper, singing: 'Been ridin' with you for twelve years. Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?'

The original lyric should read: ''Been ridin' with you for six years.'

She also changed the line, 'Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could'' to 'Like I couldn't do it for you like that wack b***h could.'

And for now, Beyoncé keeps on staff her veteran bodyguard Julius De Boer, who remains one of her closest 'confidants' and 'knows everything,' according to the source.

Indeed, it was was Julius, a Dutchman, believed to be a divorced father-of-one, who prevented Beyoncé's younger sister Solange Knowles from attacking Jay Z in her new infamous elevator attack at a bash following the Met Ball in May.

Despite reports that the furious row between Solange and Jay was over his close friendship with singer Rihanna, a source claimed that his relationship with his former protégé is not believed to be romantic.

If the most powerful couple in music do divorce, one thing is for certain - Beyoncé has certainly got control of all of her hard-earned cash.

In December 2013, following the surprise release of her self-titled visual album, she made it clear: 'I started my own company.'

Referring to Parkwood Entertainment, the entertainment and management company she founded in 2008 after parting ways with her longtime manager, father Matthew Knowles, she told fans at a private screening at New York's School of Visual Arts Theatre: 'When I decided to manage myself it was important that I didn’t go to some big management company.

'I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career you don’t have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success - you do it yourself.'

According to a longtime New York attorney, 
the couple would certainly have a pre-nup in place following their 
Manhattan wedding on April 4, 2008

Raoul Felder, a noted matrimonial and family lawyer, told MailOnline: 'If these people didn't have a pre-nuptial agreement 
they ought to see a psychiatrist - not a lawyer!

 favorite hue is Jay Z Blue': Beyonce posted a heartwarming Instagram

Apartment hunting: Sources reveal that apart from looking at New York properties, Beyoncé is also looking in Los Angeles as well. The couple are seen on stage in Seattle on Wednesday night

'But
 there are some who believe that true love conquers all, sometimes 
people are romantic - look at Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, people 
can be irrational.

'I don't think this is the case here however, you're dealing with two people who are extremely savvy, it's all about business.' The pair own a string of properties, including the 8,309-square-foot penthouse at 195 Hudson Street in Tribeca, Manhattan in September 2004 for $6.85million - and now valued at considerably more.

And Mr Felder said: 'In cases where there is lots of money, it's much easier to resolve. When there's a lot of money on the table, it's easier to draw a line. Money is a strange commodity, the more you have, the less important it is.

'And with the pre-nup, that really ends any arguments.'

The lawyer pointed out the couple could file in any state where they own a home - not just New York, so they could pick a state with minimal exposure to ensure they maintain control.

Asked about a potential custody arrange for Jay and Bey's daughter, Mr Felder said: 'This would be no ordinary divorce, there would be no father fighting to keep his child in state, these people have private planes - they could be living in Timbuktu!'

For the moment, the couple are not believed to be shopping around for divorce lawyers - and sources maintain that a split, if it happens, would not be announced until the end of the tour at the Stade de France in Paris in September.

Perhaps 
what will be extremely telling will be any appearance the couple make at
 this year's VMAs on August 24, in Inglewood, California.

Beyoncé leads the VMA nominees with eight bids, including Video of the Year for 'Drunk in Love', her collaboration with Jay Z.

It was at the 2011 VMAs, Bey famously announced
 she was pregnant with Blue Ivy by popping open her sequined blazer and 
rubbing her belly for the crowd while Jay Z and Kanye West high-fived 
each other - and now the Daily News reports MTV wants Bey to open the awards WITHOUT her husband.

What is indeed certain is Beyoncé's bid to keep up appearances - this week she posted a cute Instagram snap of Jay and Blue Ivy, with the note: 'My favorite hue is Jay Z Blue' - although privately it seems she's most definitely making plans for a fresh start without Jay.

As the New York Post reported this week, the superstar has been secretly shopping for new digs without Jay Z- viewing a $21.5 million Chelsea penthouse early last month just weeks after the elevator incident.

The 4,045-square-foot West 19th Street property is still a far cry from the couple's sprawling loft, and a source said: 'She was very quiet, as if she was looking on the sly.'

Working: Beyonce shared this image of her and Jay Z during their Chicago show, featuring her sitting on a higher platform than him

And MailOnline has learned that the superstar singer has also been looking at properties in Los Angeles.

Calling time on the marriage, a source told the Post: 'There’s still something there, even though it’s not going to last. 
Business is always part of the equation. They know they’re the king and 
queen of hip-hop - and really, all of music. Neither wants to lose 
that.'

The insider also 
alleged: 'Knowing them as I do, obviously there’s a little something to 
certain rumors. When your man or your woman isn’t getting it done for 
you, and I’m talking emotionally, not necessarily sexually… they keep 
things quiet.'
