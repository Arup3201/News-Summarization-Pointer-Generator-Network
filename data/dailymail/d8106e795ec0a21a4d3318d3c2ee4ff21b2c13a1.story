Never before seen underwater footage of the Costa Concordia salvage operation has emerged as the year anniversary of the ship's sinking approaches.

The cruise ship still remains marooned and half-sunk off the coast of Tuscany - a haunting reminder of the tragedy which saw 32 people lose their lives on January 13, 2012.

It was estimated the salvage operation would take at least a year after the ship ran into a reef and capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio after Captain Francesco Schettino allegedly made an unauthorised diversion from his programmed route.

CBS News 60 Minutes programme used a variety of tools to get as close as possible to the shipwreck and film scenes from inside the sunken vessel.

60 Minutes producer Rich Bonin, said: 'You've got this giant thing that's three football fields long sitting on a slanted mountainside underwater. It's like nothing you've ever seen before.'

The footage on the programme shows the former deck where passengers used to sunbath turned on its side while the cruise ship's swimming pool lies half submerged in the sea.

Mr Bonin described the scenes on board the sunken Concordia, saying: 'You could see people walking across what used to be the side of the ship - and is now the top of the ship.

'And the salvage workers hang their equipment on the very floor where the passengers used to sunbathe or sip their cocktails. Everything is just topsy turvy - and those pictures have never been seen before.'

He also described the difficulties in securing the images. 'We covered it with cameras in ways we don't usually,' he explained. 'We had cameras on huge barges that gave us stability so they wouldn't be shaky.

'We crept right up to the edge of the ship and put cameras up against the windows so we could see inside.'

Mr Bonin also described how the film crew used hovering drones - similar to 'remote control airplanes people have as kids' - with cameras strapped to them to get just inches from the ship.

The crew used numerous methods to gather footage from all over the ship - above and below the water

Mr Bonin added that he was deeply affected by the footage captured. He said: 'You realise that at 1am in January on a freezing cold night, people were slipping down from the top of the deck down into the freezing cold water.

'Everyone knows this was a scene of a tragedy and it affects you. '

Prosecutors have concluded their investigation into the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia cruise liner and are preparing to seek a trial for its captain and seven other people, a magistrate said on Thursday.

Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship, which was carrying some 4,000 passengers and crew when it hit rocks and capsized after he brought it too close to the island of Giglio.

Francesco Verusio, who headed the investigation in the Tuscan port city of Grosseto, said he expected to file a request for an indictment at the end of January. He said Schettino faces up to 20 years in jail.

A judge will then decide if there is enough evidence to hold a trial, Reuters reports.

The 114,500 ton liner hit rocks after Schettino tried to perform a maneuver known as a 'salute' - an attempt to show passengers the island and islanders the ship.

He argues he managed to prevent a worse disaster by steering into shallow waters even closer to shore after the impact to facilitate the rescue operation.

Five other members of the crew, including Schetttino's first officer, and three members of a crisis unit set up by Costa to deal with the accident also face indictment and trial.
