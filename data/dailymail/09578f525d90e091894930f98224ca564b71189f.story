An orthopedic surgeon often slapped anesthetized patients on the buttocks so hard that he left red marks or hand prints, according to a federal complaint.

Michael Clarke, 47, also allegedly insulted some of his patients, calling them 'fat [expletive]', and discussed graphic sexual acts with staff in the operating room, witnesses told investigators.

St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center in Syracuse, New York also faces
 sanctions following claims they did nothing about his behavior, and it could be terminated from the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Clarke, a married orthopedic surgeon who specializes in hip replacement, was not identified in the federal report, but a complaint filed in January with the state Health Department identifies him and the details of the two complaints match up, according to the Syracuse Post-Standard.

Investigation: Michael Clarke, an orthopedic surgeon, allegedly slapped the buttocks of patients after he put them under anesthetic - but claimed he was simply checking to see if the anesthetic had worked

The state health department's findings are the basis of the federal report.

It says that 11 members of staff told investigators that Clarke sometimes slapped the patients, while eight of these also said he used sexually explicit language.Â 

One worked said the doctors would 'almost wind up' before slapping a patient.

But Clarke said he was simply doing his job, according to the report, which names him 'Physician #1.'

'Physician #1 explained it was how he/she 
checked for the adequacy of the patient's spinal anesthesia,' it says.

'All 11 
staff indicated they had never seen another physician use the slap 
method to check the adequacy of a spinal and that Physician #1 did not 
slap all hip replacement patients.'

A member of staff reported the doctor's behavior 
to administrators early last year, according to a report by the federal 
Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Scene: St Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse, New York also faces repercussions for allegedly failing to respond adequately enough to staff members' complaints about the surgeon

But they said the hospital did nothing, while others said they did not come forward about how he treated patients because they did not think anything would be done or feared losing their jobs.

Clarke, who lives in Manlius, operated at St. Joe's until he moved to Crouse Hospital in February.

The Onondaga County District Attorney's Office is also investigating him for possible criminal conduct and they expect to complete their investigation in two weeks.

But St Joe's said that administrators took prompt action after learning of the doctor's behavior and the report states that Clarke was told to stop slapping patients and he was monitored at work.

But it also adds that the hospital assigned 
four staffers to monitor the doctor without fully instructing them how to do so, meaning that their results were incomplete.

Clarke's lawyer said his client denies wrongdoing but won't comment on the investigation.
