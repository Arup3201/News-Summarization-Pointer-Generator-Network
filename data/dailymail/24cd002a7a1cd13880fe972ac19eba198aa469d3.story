A mother has been arrested along with her boyfriend and their lodger on suspicion of murdering her newborn baby son.

Katarzyna Gacek, 24, was arrested after her son Thomas died last week after being taken to hospital with severe head injuries.

Police launched an investigation after medics alerted reported suspicions that the injuries may have been deliberately inflicted.

Officers are now examining the possibility that the seven-week-old boy could have been shaken to death.

Thomas was taken from his home in Oldham to the Royal Oldham Hospital in the early hours of January 25, and was later transferred to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where he died.

The 23-year-old mother, from Poland, and her 35-year-old boyfriend were originally arrested on suspicion of assault, and were later released on bail.

However, last night they were re-arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

Their lodger, a 26-year-old man, has also been arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

Police are now searching the house where the three suspects live.

Thomas is not believed to be the son of his mother's boyfriend - officers are currently working to establish who his father is.

No other children are thought to live at the address.

Detective Inspector Andy Cunliffe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This is a tragic case in which a very young baby has lost his life, and we are determined to find out exactly what the circumstances were that led to him suffering such injuries.

'News of the death of such a little boy will no doubt come as a great shock to people and I would like to try and reassure the community as much as I can that we have a team of detectives dedicated to working on this investigation, and they will today be interviewing the three people in our custody.

'If anyone has any information at all that they believe may assist us with our inquiries, then please get in touch and tell us what you know.'
