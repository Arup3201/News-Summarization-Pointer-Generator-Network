Green spender: People spend £30,000 a year on their garden, a third of which goes on planets

Homeowners spend £30,000 on their garden over a lifetime, a study has found.

Researchers found the typical green-fingered adult will spend a third of the amount on plants alone.

The rest of cost includes keeping the lawn, flowerbeds, shrubs and trees in tip-top condition, as well as forking out for garden buildings, ornaments and patios.

The survey by online garden centre, GardeningExpress.co.uk, asked 540 gardeners about their spending habits.

They found gardeners spend £9,500 during the course of their life on plants alone. This included buying seeds, bulbs, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, grass seed, turf and vegetable plants.

The second highest expenditure was on hard landscaping at £9,000, with homeowners changing their patio or deck six times over the course of their gardening lifetime.

Garden furniture, including tables, chairs and outdoor lighting accounted for £3,600 of the total amount.

Those questioned said they needed something decent to sit on or relax in to enjoy their garden which explained why furniture was updated or replaced around eight times.

This was closely followed by essential tools like spades, forks, rakes, shears and secateurs which totalled just under £3,500.

Gardeners admitted to spending over £1,800 on their sheds and greenhouses claiming they replaced their shed four times and even their greenhouse twice.

The cost of garden electrics, including a lawnmower, strimmer, hedge trimmer and garden vacuum, came in at £1,320 with the remaining spend, £720, being used on the barbecues gardeners purchased for the summer months.

One male gardener, who was involved in the research, said: ‘I spend hours in the garden but had no idea quite how much it was costing me.

‘For that I could buy myself a decent car or give my daughter a deposit for her house. I see my garden as an investment – if it looks good then it adds value to my property which has to be a good thing.’

A female respondent added: ‘Plants are my biggest weakness. Even if I just pop to the garden centre for a browse around, I end up leaving with a car full. Many I don’t really need – my garden is full up already, but I always manage to find a space to plant it in, even if it means digging up something else and giving that to a neighbour.’

Another added: ‘I never scrimp when it comes to garden furniture. It has to look good and it has to be comfortable. My husband loves pottering around in the garden. I like to use the garden for relaxing – a sun lounger on the deck with a glass of wine beside me and a good book is my perfect summers day. ‘

The second highest expenditure is on hard-surfacing with adults changing their patios six times

Chris Bonnett from GardeningExpress.co.uk said: ‘I would imagine very few gardeners would expect their garden to be costing them £30,000.

‘Many of the tools and electricals can last for years. It’s only plants that you need to buy every year so it’s very easy to lose track of how much you are actually shelling out.’ A study last year found those who spend their free time pruning the roses or pottering in the vegetable patch are trimmer than their non-gardening neighbours.

Women were a dress size smaller, while men who went to an allotment could expect to be around a stone lighter.

Previous studies have credited gardening with a host of benefits, from raising zest for life to boosting happiness.
