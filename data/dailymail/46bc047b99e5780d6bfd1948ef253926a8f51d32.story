Tears fell and the loved ones of murdered high school sophomore Nichole Cable embraced in Maine on Friday as her killer was finally found guilty of her senseless slaying.

Kyle Dube, 21, or Orono, was convicted of luring the 15-year-old girl using a fake Facebook profile, before kidnapping and murdering her in May of 2013, in a botched plot to make himself look like a hero.

It took the jury of seven men and five women in Penobscot County Superior Court in Bangor less than an hour to find Dube guilty and the prosecution said the speedy verdict reflected the 'overwhelming' evidence against him.

The victims parents left without speaking to the media following the nine-day trial, but relatives and friends wept and hugged as the verdict was handed down.

Dube was found guilty of staging Cable's kidnapping so he could later rescue her and be hailed as a hero.

Instead, Cable died of asphyxiation and her remains were found in the woods in Old Town on May 20 after an eight-day search.

Dube had covered up her body with leaves and sticks.

After the verdict was announced, Cable's father began to applaud, the Bangor Daily News reported. 

Other friends and family of Cable began to cry, as did Dube's mother and other family members. 

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese called the crime 'a cautionary tale'.

She said. 'It's a cautionary tale to everyone to be careful when you are using social media.'

During the two-week trial, the prosecution's case centered on Dube's use of a phony Facebook account to lure Cable out of her home. 

The profile, under the name of another man who was not involved in Cable's abduction, was traced back to Dube's home.

During testimony, that man told jurors he was aware Dube didn't like him. 

Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the horrid crimes 

DNA evidence also tied Dube to Cable's disappearance and several people, including fellow inmates and an ex-girlfriend, testified Dube confessed to the crime.

The convicted felon told others that he'd intended to abduct Cable and later come to her rescue, according to police. 

His plan was to kidnap her while wearing a ski mask and return later without the disguise and find her.

Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the kidnapping and murder. 

Dube, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify.

He faces 25 years to life in prison for the murder conviction and up to 30 years for the kidnapping conviction.

David Walker, the superintendent of the high school Cable attended, said he has not seen a dramatic change in the way students use social media.

He said: 'Hopefully they recognize that the internet isn't always a safe place.

'Everyone is reminding students of the dangers, both parents and teachers.'
