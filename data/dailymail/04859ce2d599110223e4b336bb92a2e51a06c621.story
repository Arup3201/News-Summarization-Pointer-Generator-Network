A teenager obsessed with designer labels was given a birthday cake in the shape of a Louis Vuitton handbag after she helped steal £150,000 from a string of bank accounts, a court heard.

Aamna Aliani, 18, bought Christian Louboutin shoes, Dolce & Gabbana clothes and dozens of handbags on an incredible spending spree.

The teenager, together with accomplices Derrick Mensah, 20, and David Kwarteng, 27, hijacked confidential credit and debit card details from 22 Lloyds TSB customers before they hit the shops.

They blew tens of thousands of pounds at Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada stores in London's exclusive Mayfair.

Thousands of pounds in cash were also withdrawn from bank branches in Hammersmith, west London; High Road and Cranbrook Road in Ilford, Essex; East Gate, Harlow; Wood Green, north London; and Knightsbridge, southwest London.

Aliani also used the cash to purchase a gym membership from Fitness First for £534 while Mensah bought £200 gift vouchers from John Lewis, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The two month-long scam unravelled on May 14, 2011, when police became suspicious after spotting Kwatreng waiting in a BMW for Aliani, while she was shopping at Louis Vuitton in central London's Conduit Street.

Aliani had purchased two designer bags worth £1,130 and also had a further £860 in cash on her.

Five envelopes in the BMW were stuffed full with a total of £12,800 while the car boot was also heaving with trendy clothing.

Prosecutor Nicholas Mather said the total loss was in the region of £144,000.

'In short this case involves the taking over of individuals' bank accounts and the use of the credit and debit cards that are attached to those accounts.

'A memory stick was found on Kwatreng which was full of financial information relating to a number of different bank accounts.

'The information included dates of birth and addresses and confidential data such as telephone banking passwords.

'Someone has had access using the information on the memory stick to 22 individuals' bank accounts.

'The method used is identical - the bank would be telephoned and the (account holder's) address would be changed to one of two addresses in Harlow, Essex.

'The bank would then be informed that the card was damaged and a new card sent out to the false address.

David Kwarteng (left), 27, of Canonbury, north London admitted fraud, two counts of possessing articles for use in fraud and possession of criminal property and (right) Derrick Mensah, 20, of Stoke Newington, north London, admitted four counts of fraud

'The card would then be used either to make purchases of luxury goods or withdraw money.

'The
total loss from compromised cards, whoever was responsible, whether it 
was one of the defendants or others, is something in the region of 
£144,000.

'There is also the enormous inconvenience to the card holders and the banks.'

When
police arrested the gang they found pictures of designer clothes, wads 
of cash and the handbag birthday cake which had been taken on their 
mobile phones.

Aliani, who 
was just 16 at the time of the scam, and Mensah were each sentenced to a
year in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to 
complete 240 hours unpaid work.

Kwarteng,
who has previous convictions including handling stolen goods, was 
immediately jailed for one year. Relatives in the public gallery wept as
the sentence was passed.

Mr Justice Nicol said: 'All three of 
you were involved in the use of replacement bank cards which the banks 
had been talked into sending to a false address.

'The cards were then used to withdraw cash or buy expensive items of clothing.'

Addressing Kwatreng, the judge said: 'Your offending was part of a professional operation but it was only over two days.

'The offence of possessing criminal property is intended to discourage the criminal activity which generates such property.'

Mr Justice Nicol told Aliani: 'Your role was the most serious of the three defendants and you used the cards most extensively, in total spending £22,700.

'It's clear you have had some difficulties in your family background and the lure of the lifestyle which this offending held or appeared to promise obviously proved to be too much.'

James McCrindell, for Aliani, said: 'This is someone who can be punished in the community. The focus can still be in respect of rehabilitation rather than sentence.

'At the start of her criminal conduct she was just 16, turning 17 when she was arrested. She is now 18 and has looked back on her conduct and realises she went the wrong way.

'She recognises and accepts responsibility for her offending and says she only has herself to blame. She is a good young person who, notwithstanding disadvantages, has always tried to do the right thing.'

Jeremy Ornstin, defending Kwatreng, said grew up in a 'challenging environment' but 'against the odds' is now embarking on a degree at the University of Hertfordshire.

Ray Hedlam, for Mensah, urged the judge to take a merciful course.

Aliani, of south Tottenham, north London, admitted 12 counts of fraud and possession of criminal property.

Mensah, of Newington Green, Stoke Newington, north London, admitted four counts of fraud.

Kwatreng, of Canonbury, north London admitted fraud, two counts of possessing articles for use in fraud and possession of criminal property.
