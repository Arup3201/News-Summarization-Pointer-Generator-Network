Apple's much anticipated system that lets iPhone 6 owners pay simply by tapping their phone has been launched.

Called Apple Pay, it can store  Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information.

It works with the handset's touch ID fingerprint recognition system.

The system was first announced on September 9th, and is expected to be made available to consumers this weekend.

Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch.

The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.

This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card.

All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.

If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service.

Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the top US banks. 

In addition to American Express, Bank of America, Capital One Bank, Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and others, who announced support in September, more than 500 new banks from across the country have signed on to Apple Pay, CEO Tim Cook revealed last week.

'Our team has worked incredibly hard to make Apple Pay private and secure, with the simplicity of a single touch of your finger,' said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. 'The reaction to Apple Pay has been amazing. We continue to add more Apple Pay ready banks, credit card companies and merchants, and think our users will love paying with Apple Pay.'

'We are excited to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop at Whole Foods Market,' said Walter Robb, co-CEO of Whole Foods Market. 

'We are thrilled to be one of the first retailers to accept Apple Pay across all of our locations nationwide as it offers our shoppers a fast, private and secure check out option at our stores.'

Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information, the firm says. 

It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. 

Apple doesn't collect your purchase history, so when you are shopping in a store or restaurant we don't know what you bought, where you bought it or how much you paid for it. 

The service will be able to store Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information. Apple said shops like Macy's and Bloomingdales, drugstores including Walgreen's and Duane Reade, and other stores including McDonald's, Staples, Subway and Whole Foods are participating in Apple Pay.

Actual card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. 

The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud.

Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many of the leading banks nationwide, which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the US.*

In addition to the 262 Apple retail stores in the US, availability from leading retailers at launch include: Aéropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies'R'Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, SUBWAY, Toys'R'Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. 

In addition, many others will add support this year, such as Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and more. 

The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.

The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone.

All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.

It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it.

Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. 

This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted.

The cards are stores in the passbook app already used for boarding passes and tickets. Users can see their recent transactions in the app, and switch between cards easily.

If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. 

This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. 

Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a date has yet to be announced.

The Cupertinpo-based firm says it's easier and more secure than using a credit or debit card. 

To add a card, a user will take a picture of it with their iPhone and send it to an Apple data centre.

There it will be verified it with their bank before it gets added to the user's Passbook.
