England have called up Sale’s Anglo-Kiwi forward Michael Paterson to join their tour and the 29-year-old is on course to play against the Crusaders in his home city of Christchurch on Tuesday.

The former New Zealand Under 21 player qualifies for England via his late English grandfather. He played Super Rugby for four years and had a successful stint with Cardiff Blues before joining Sale last summer.

Called up: Michael Paterson has been drafted into the England squad ahead of Tuesday's game with Crusaders

His performances earned him a place in the national training squad at the end of the season and now he has been called in as an extra lock option, having been visiting family on the south island.

Paterson joined England’s training session on Friday morning ahead of the second Test, with a view to being involved in the tour match next week.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘We wanted some second row cover and with Michael having trained with us leading up to the Barbarians game and knowing our systems, it made sense to call on him as he was in Christchurch visiting family.

'He trained well with us this morning and will be in contention for selection, for what is an important match against the Crusaders.'
