Good Morning America weatherman Sam Champion married his Brazilian partner Rubem Robierb on Friday afternoon after coming out and announcing their engagement in October.

Mr Champion, 51, tied the knot with Rubem Robierb, 35, a fine-arts photographer, in an ‘intimate ceremony at Champion's Manhattan apartment’, according to People magazine.

The couple, who met three years ago at a New Year's Eve party in Miami, were surrounded by small group of family and friends, including other Good Morning America personalities.

New York State Supreme Court Justice George J. Silver conducted the 10-minute ceremony, People reports.

Good Morning America colleague Robin Roberts, who is recovering from a bone marrow transplant but feeling well enough to attend, recited a poem by Elizabeth Barrett Brownin.

Mr Champion revealed on October 5 that he is gay and that he and his partner of three years would soon marry.

The weather anchor's sexual orientation had long been known to his friends and media colleagues, but he had never publicly discussed it before making the announcement.

Mr Champion is just the latest in a string of celebrities to have come out this year via a low-key, offhand comment.

The news of Champion's coming out was first revealed in the pages of the New York Times, in an article on the wedding of gay MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts.

Mr Champion and Mr Robierb were present at the event and were seen taking to the dancefloor together.

'We're getting married New Year's Eve in Miami,' Mr Champion told the Times.

But his Brazilian fiancé corrected: 'We'll do it here officially, and then have a party in Miami.'

Same-sex marriage has been legal in New York since last year, but is not legal in Florida. The pair are expected to split their time between the two states.

In a statement on the ABC News website posted in October, Mr Champion said: 'We are thrilled and so excited and thank everyone for their good wishes.'

He later tweeted: 'I've never been happier to share a bit of personal news!!'

Mr Champion has been a TV weatherman for over two decades, and has been on Good Morning America since 2006.

Coming out: The veteran host has never publicly discussed his sexuality before

The cast and crew of Good Morning America cheered on their colleague at 8am on Friday and offered him and his husband their best wishes.

When asked if he were nervous, Mr Champion said, 'The whole family's at the house right now ... so I should be nervous.'

Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos told Champion to 'remember every second' of his special day.

A larger wedding party for the newly weds will take place in Miami on New Year's Eve.

Mr Champion's decision to reveal his sexuality through a casual reference after years of being openly gay in private follows a recent trend of celebrities slipping out of the proverbial closet without making a fuss.

The most famous example was that of CNN host Anderson Cooper, who revealed the worst-kept secret in TV with a brief email to blogger Andrew Sullivan in July.

Jim Parsons, star of The Big Bang Theory, came out in an interview with the New York Times in May in which he talked about his boyfriend.
