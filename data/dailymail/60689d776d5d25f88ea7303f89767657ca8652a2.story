Southampton are in meltdown after they fired their two fabled academy coaches Jason Dodd and Paul Williams ‘for not spending enough time with the players’.

Dodd and Williams were sacked despite being credited with bringing through Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers, James Ward-Prowse, Harry Reed and Sam Gallagher through the club’s highly-regarded academy to the first team.

Sportsmail understands Shaw, who is currently away with the England squad in Portugal preparing for the World Cup, reacted furiously to the news.

Not happy: Shaw then replied to a post by BBC reporter Adam Blackmore by saying 'wrong decision'

Dodd, who made nearly 400 appearances for Southampton, has been left stunned by the decision to fire him and Williams, who was a member of the Saints' FA Cup final squad against Arsenal in 2003..

The pair were called into the club on Monday and told of their fate by interim academy director Matt Hale.

It’s understood they were 
told they did not spend enough time with the Under 16 squad and that 
their relationship with another coach, Martin Hunter, was not healthy.

Sam Gallagher Striker who made 16 league appearances for Southampton this season and is also an England Under 19 international.

Dodd
 is highly regarded by the parents of the young players in Southampton’s
 academy, who will be shocked by the manner and timing of his 
departure.

There has been friction at the club between academy staff and coaches since January as they bicker over the future direction of their youngsters.

Southampton are about to move into a 
stunning new training facility on the grounds of their existing complex,
 but Dodd and Williams will not be part of it.

The move has been met with disbelief at St Mary’s by both staff and players as they head into a summer of uncertainty.

Shaw is leaving Southampton when he 
returns from the World Cup with England and captain Adam Lallana has 
also made it clear he is quitting when he returns from South America.

Centre back Dejan Lovren, who was outstanding in 
his first season at St Mary's, will agitate to leave if the Saints start selling their best players.

Southampton were unavailable for comment.
