A ruthless carjacker who stabbed a businessman to death for his prized black Mercedes SLK was today jailed, along with his getaway driver, for a total of 43 years.

Rory Gordon, 23, of Bow, east London, knifed Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, when he refused to hand over the keys to the car.

Mr Bhurji bled to death at the side of the road in front of his friend, Kajal Bhardwa, just moments after confessing he ‘liked’ her.

Gordon, a cannabis dealer with a previous conviction for robbery, stole the Mercedes to order after being promised just £1,000.

He was convicted of murder while his getaway driver, Jae-don Fearon, 21, whose father was murdered in 2003, was convicted of manslaughter.

Judge Michael Topolski sentenced Gordon to life imprisonment with a minimum of 30 years and Fearon to 13 years imprisonment.

The judge said: ‘Harjit Bhurji, known as Raj, was passionate about cars. He studied and worked hard,

eventually securing a job at Mercedes Benz.

'He won many awards and made his family proud. His dream was to run his own business, a dream he realised. He was popular and much loved.

‘You Rory Gordon took his life. You murdered him for his car. The life that he had built up was extinguished in a few moments of greed and brutality.

‘You Jaedon Fearon played an important role in the events of that night. You know well the devastating effects of losing a loved one at the hands of a violent criminal.’

Andre Campbell, Gordon’s 23-year-old 
cousin, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years 
for selling on Mr Bhurji’s stolen mobile.

The Old Bailey heard Gordon and Fearon were specifically looking for a Mercedes SLK to steal while driving around east London.

On September 13, 2011 they spotted Mr 
Bhurji’s car with its personalised numberplate and followed him until he
 parked up in Ilford.

While 
Fearon waited in the getaway vehicle, Gordon approached the Mercedes and
 dragged Miss Bhardwa from the passenger seat before demanding the keys.

Mr Bhurji hid the keys under his seat and claimed it was not his car.

Miss
 Bhardwa, a 25 year-old business analyst, described in court the 
horrifying moment the masked man threatened to slit her throat if Mr 
Bhurji, known as Raj, refused to cooperate.

‘He
 turned to me and said “give me the key or I will slit her throat”’, she
 said. ‘I genuinely thought he was going to do it. I thought I was going
 to die.

‘I was saying give him the keys I see him suddenly lunge forward towards Raj and at that point I knew he had stabbed him. I knew it was somewhere in the chest area. I just remember Raj’s face when it happened.

'He had a very pained expression on his face when it happened and he made like a gasping noise and I just saw him hold his chest and I knew he had been stabbed.

‘I saw all this dark red on him. His face looked in agony even though he wasn’t screaming. All I see is his hand on his chest and his eyes, just fixed on me. It was an image I can always remember, to this day.’

Mr Bhurji managed to retrieve the keys from under his seat and hand them over before collapsing to the ground. The carjacker then drove off.

Police recovered the Mercedes, which was fitted with a tracking device, at 2.50am parked three miles away in Chingford, east London.

Mr Bhurji’s iPhone, which was in the vehicle when it was taken, was recovered days later after it was sold on by Campbell.

Campbell sold Mr Bhurji’s stolen iPhone to the owner of a kebab shop for £100. The phone was later recovered by officers investigating the murder.

Gordon admitted to the jury that Mr Bhurji ‘ended up getting stabbed’ but claimed he did not mean to kill him.

‘The guy came in my direction, I jumped back and jabbed with my right hand,’ he said. ‘I never intended to stab anyone. It happened so fast, as soon as he came towards me I pulled away.’

The court heard Fearon was ten years old when his father Jason was shot dead in a gangland shootout in Clerkenwell in Easter 2003.

His speech at his father’s funeral received national coverage and in 2004 he was given the Woman’s Own Children of Courage award and met former prime minister Tony Blair and Prince Charles.

Gordon denied murder but was convicted. Fearon, of Chingford, denied murder and was convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter. Campbell, of Chingford, was found guilty of handling stolen goods.
