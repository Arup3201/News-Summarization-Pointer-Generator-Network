Apple’s Siri is set to get a makeover - and the changes could see the personal assistant app being fitted in your home.

The firm recently won a patent that would see the personal assistant app interacting with sensors in different rooms of a house, tracking you as you move around, before carrying out relevant tasks.

For example, if Siri knows the time and knows you’re in the front room near a TV, it could remind you to watch your favourite shows.

Apple recently won a patent that could see Siri interacting with sensors in the home. For example, people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning, or with their main meal in the kitchen at night.

The patent, details a system in which Apple’s personal assistant app Siri would be used to interact with sensors around a person’s home.

For example, people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning.

If Siri knows the time and knows a homeowner is in their the front room, it could reminder them to watch their favourite shows.

Outside of the home, other examples include the assistant being used to: 'assist individuals who are 
impaired in some way, including elderly people, and surgeons, whose eyes, hands and brains are 
constantly busy when performing operations.'

Although the patent doesn’t explicitly 
say what the sensors would consist of, signals could be taken from 
web-enabled devices already in the home, or bought separately. 

Future versions, in theory, could reverse the process and be used to control devices or the sensors using Siri.

Alternatively, people who take medicine regularly could be given a nudge to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning, or with their main meal in the kitchen at night.

Apple’s patent calls the home assistant an ‘active ontology’.

Ontology is a term used in computer science to describe a system of 'tasks being carried out using a variety of knowledge bases.'

Although the patent doesn’t explicitly say what the sensors would consist of, signals could be taken from web-enabled devices already in the home, or be bought separately.

The patent, originally uncovered by Patently Apple, said the assistant would be 'in communication with a plurality of sensors distributed throughout the domain and adapted to convey observed facts relating to the user's behaviour (e.g., ‘the user is in the kitchen’; ‘the user is in the dining room’; ‘the user is in the bathroom’).

Another example could be when homeowners go on holiday. Siri would begin by waking them up, or advising how long it will take them to get to the airport, based on current traffic reports.

It would scan the calendar to find 
flight times, and once the owner is detected near the front door using a
 sensor, it would remind the homeowner to remember their passport or 
other documents before they leave.

The patent, called 8,677,377: Method and apparatus for building an intelligent automated assistant, was published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Tuesday.

Outside of the home, the patented said: ‘Such systems may assist individuals who are impaired in some way (e.g., visually, auditorially, physically, cognitively, etc.), including elderly people, who may be stricken by one or more ailments [and] surgeons,whose eyes, hands and brains are constantly busy when performing operations, among others.'

As with all patents, the technology may never be released, or may change or adapt before it is turned into reality.

Sensors placed in rooms would interact with the personal assistant app

@highlight

These sensors would tell the app which room a homeowner is in

It would then perform a relevant task, using other software signals
