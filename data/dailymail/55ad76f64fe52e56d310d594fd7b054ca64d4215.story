She did not give birth to her second daughter Hollie until she was 40, nearly died in the process and was left in intensive care for four days.

Now Amanda Holden has admitted she thinks it is ‘a mistake’ for women to leave having children as late in life as she did.

Miss Holden, 42, endured the heartache of a miscarriage and then the trauma of giving birth to a stillborn baby at seven months, a son she named Theo, while she was in her late 30s.

The Britain’s Got Talent judge has warned women against waiting as long as she did to have a family and revealed many of her female friends are now struggling to conceive having put motherhood on hold until their late 30s or 40s.

‘It is a mistake to wait,’ she told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival.

She said it was better to be in ‘a nice relationship’ before having a baby but she appreciated that ‘wasn’t always easy’.

‘But have your babies before 40 if you can,’ she said.

The actress said her ‘girlfriends’ in the entertainment industry had also put off having a family until their late 30s or early 40s and many had struggled to conceive through IVF.

‘All my friends had babies late,’ she said. ‘A lot of them have had trouble.’

But she said she thought attitudes to women in the industry were changing and it was becoming more acceptable to have children while working.

‘Half The Saturdays [a girl band] are pregnant,’ she said. ‘I think that’s a good thing.’

Miss Holden is married to music producer Chris Hughes, who she has described as the love of her life, and they have two daughters, Lexi, 7 and Hollie, who is almost two-years-old.

Miss Holden also hit back at criticism she received online for continuing to work after her baby was stillborn and also when her second daughter was born.

Asked about Mumsnet, the online mothers’ forum where she was the target of abuse, she said: ‘It could be a really positive thing and there are some great things on there.

‘But there are a lot of people who spend all day slagging people off.

‘I think, why can’t mums support each other? It makes me furious.

‘We all love a good b**** and it is good to have a gossip but there’s so much negativity from women towards other women.’

She added she wanted her two daughters to grow up with ‘a positive relationship with other women’.

She explained she had gone straight back into work after both traumatic experiences for the sake of her older daughter Lexi, 7.

‘One day (straight after coming out of hospital) I stayed in my pyjamas,’ she said. ‘Lexi came home from school and was absolutely appalled I was still in my pyjamas, so I never did that again.

‘The normality for her was to see me going back to work.’

She revealed that she had taken newborn Hollie to Britain’s Got Talent auditions in Birmingham when she was just a week old, because she was there when she had last felt her stillborn son Theo kick.

‘The next day I was told he would be stillborn,’ she said. ‘I wanted to make that journey with my actual baby in my arms.

‘If it was Manchester or anywhere else I wouldn’t have done it.

‘But I believe in circles and I came back to where I started.’

Miss Holden was at the festival to promote her autobiography, No Holding Back.
