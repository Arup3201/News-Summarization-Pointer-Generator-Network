Garry Monk believes referees should be banned for poor performances following two controversial decisions from Anthony Taylor during Swansea’s 1-1 draw with QPR on Thursday.

The Swansea boss was incensed after QPR goalkeeper Rob Green handled outside the box but was not dismissed before Taylor sent off Wayne Routledge for kicking out at Karl Henry.

He said: ‘I am losing a bit of faith and so are my players when we continuously have decisions like this.

‘I just hope Wayne’s card gets rescinded. He goes from nearly having a leg broken to being sent off. He (Routledge) nudges him (Henry) away. No justice whatsoever.

‘With the other one (Green’s handball) it is a half metre outside the box.’

Asked if officials should serve a suspension for game-changing errors, Monk added: ‘I lose a player and I have to suffer so officials should suffer as well.’

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson called for the introduction of video technology after his side fell victim to two terrible penalty decisions in a 2-2 draw at Liverpool.

He said: ‘The officials are there to do a job and we could make it much easier if technology was utilised. It takes a couple of seconds.’
