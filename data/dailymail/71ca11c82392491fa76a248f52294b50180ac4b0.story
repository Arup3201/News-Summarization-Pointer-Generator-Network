One of Britain’s most iconic buildings which offers outstanding views of the Avon Gorge has hit the housing market for a whopping £2million.

The gorge and Clifton Suspension Bridge can be seen from the Clifton Observatory, which even comes with its own camera obscura and cave system.

The site of the astonishing 337ft Grade II listed former mill on the outskirts of Bristol has been used as a lookout post since at least the Iron Age.

More recently it has been an observatory since the 18th century and is now being sold by owner John Michallat, after completing extensive renovations.

Mr Michallat said: ‘I feel that I have fulfilled my part in the project. What was pretty much a derelict building has been renovated.

'It will be sad not to have my association with the observatory any more, but I am proud that we have managed to restore it and save it for the city.'

The site contains Gough Cave - a winding passageway through the cliff that opens up into a great cavern, with a small terraced balcony in the cliff face.

Lookout: It also contains planning permission to turn part of the Observatory into a cafe - ideal for any chef who wants to serve dishes that are out of this world

The
 Observatory was originally built as a windmill for corn in 1766 and 
later converted to the grinding of snuff, when it became known as ‘The 
Snuff Mill’.

This was 
damaged by a fire in October 1777, when the sails were left turning 
during a gale and caused the equipment to catch light.

It remained derelict for 52 years until artist William West rented the old mill as a studio in 1828 for five shillings a year.

Mr
 West installed telescopes and a camera obscura, used by artists of the 
Bristol School to draw the Avon Gorge and Leigh Woods on the opposite 
side.

A 5in convex lens and sloping mirror was installed on the top of the tower, to project the panoramic view vertically down into the darkened room below.

The true image is seen on a fixed circular table 5ft in diameter, with a concave metal surface, and turn the mirror by hand to change the direction of view.

Mr West also built a tunnel from the Observatory to St Vincent’s Cave, which opens onto St Vincent’s Rocks on the cliff face.

It is 250ft above the floor of the Avon Gorge and 90ft below the cliff top.

The 2,000ft-long tunnel leads to a huge limestone cave, first mentioned as being a chapel in the year AD 305.
