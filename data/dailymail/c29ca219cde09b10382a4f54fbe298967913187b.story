Accused: MP Eric Joyce has been charged with criminal damage and two counts of assault

MP Eric Joyce has been charged with criminal damage and two counts of assault after an altercation with teenagers at a shop.

The 54-year-old independent member for Falkirk explained his actions after the incident, insisted he was only trying to stop a young vandal smashing up the property in Chalk Farm, North London.

Today, however, the Metropolitan Police confirmed he has been charged and will appear before Highbury Corner magistrates on December 30.

Writing on his blog following his arrest on October 17, Mr Joyce, a former Army major and former Labour MP, said: 'I detained a youth in a shop in London. Damage had been done to the store.

'I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene.

'The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him.'

The Metropolitan Police revealed the arrest after writing to House speaker John Bercow on October 21, according to an entry in the Commons records.

Mr Joyce added at the time: 'I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.'

A police spokesman said at the time that officers were called to 'reports of a fight'. 

The statement added: 'Upon arrival officers found a man and two teenage boys involved in an altercation.

'A 54-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of ABH.

'A 14-year-old boy [B] was also arrested at the scene for possession of cannabis.

Shop: The MP offered his account of what happened at this shop - and said he was the one who called police

'Both were taken to a central London police station for questioning. Neither required medical treatment.'

Joyce's arrival at Westminster in 2000 came shortly after he quit the Army, making claims of snobbery, sexism and racism in the armed forces.

He was elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Falkirk West in a by-election.

He increased his majority in the general elections of 2001 and 2005 when the constituency was renamed Falkirk after constituency changes, and held on by a comfortable margin in 2010.

However, he was expelled from the Labour party and became an independent MP in 2012. 

The selection of his replacement as Labour candidate in Falkirk became embroiled in a major scandal amid claims of vote-rigging.
