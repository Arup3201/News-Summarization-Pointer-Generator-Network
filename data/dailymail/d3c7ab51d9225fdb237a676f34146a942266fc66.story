A Christian production company is waging battle against the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey movie adaption by releasing its own rival romance flick, Old Fashioned, in theaters on the same day, next Valentine's Day.

'A former frat boy and a free-spirited woman together attempt the impossible: an "old-fashioned" courtship in contemporary America,' reads the film's description on IMBd; and it looks set to be the very antithesis of all that 50 Shades of Grey stands for; sex, bondage, and domination.

'I wanted to tell a love story that 
takes the idea of Godly romance seriously,' said Rik Swartzwelder, 
writer, director and lead actor of the film, before squeezing in an apt 
biblical reference: 'Opening the same weekend as Fifty Shades, there’s
 definitely a David v. Goliath comparison.'

Challengers: The Christian movie centers around 'a former frat boy (left) and a free-spirited woman (right) who together attempt the impossible, an "old-fashioned" courtship in contemporary America'

To the contrary: 50 Shades of Grey tells the erotic story of Anastasia Steele, a college student played by Dakota Johnson (pictured) who is seduced by BDSM expert Christian Grey

'We know we’re picking a fight here and that we’re more than a little outgunned,' Mr Swartzwelder writes on the movie's blog page. 'Oh well, it is what it is.'

The actor-director will star opposite Elizabeth Roberts, an actress who has played the character of Marge Bernadi in Days of Our Lives, and this year, had a minor role in Bones.

Although Mr Swartzwelder clearly seeks to appeal to die-hard Christians with his conservative tale, there seems to be room too for those who have perhaps swayed off the path of Godly righteousness.

'[The story], without apology, explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships; yet, is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and doesn’t seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes,' he explains

Going to head-to-head with the multimillion dollar blockbuster that is 50 Shades of Grey - which sees Dakota Johnson play the role of Anastasia Steele and hunky Calvin Klein model Jamie Dornan play Christian Grey - Mr Swartzwelder is comfortable being the underdog.

'We’re hopeful that there are others out there who desire more from love - and
 the movies - than objectification or domination'

'They will have more screens, more money, more hype,' he correctly identifies. 'But we’re hopeful that we are not alone in our belief that there are others out there who desire more from love - and the movies - than objectification or domination.'

The film is backed by Christian film finance firm Workting Title Agency and distributed by Freestyle, reports The Independent, and, according to co-president Mark Border will be: 'The first faith-based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved Christian singles audience.'

Big budget: 'They will have more screens, more money, more hype,' Mr Swartzwelder notes of his movie nemesis, pictured, a scene starring Dakota as Anastasia

Rivals: While the 50 Shades of Grey trailer (pictured) is so far the most-watched movie preview of 2014, Old Fashioned hopes to succeed in its mission as 'the first faith-based theatrical release to specifically target the underserved Christian singles audience'

The same team also partnered on another faith-based movie which hit theaters in March, entitled God's Not Dead, which sees a devout Christian college freshman battle it out with his aggressively atheist philosophy professor in a quest to prove the existence of God.

God's Not Dead was a roaring success and took more than $60million at box offices worldwide; made on a budget of only $2million. Leading film critics unanimously panned the movie however, labeling it 'sick,' 'ham-fisted,' 'angry,' and 'dismal.'

Even if Old Fashioned does prove as lucrative as God's Not Dead, its unlikely to touch its nemesis. The 50 Shades of Grey trailer has already been watched on YouTube over 19 million times so far, making it the most-watched film preview of 2014.
