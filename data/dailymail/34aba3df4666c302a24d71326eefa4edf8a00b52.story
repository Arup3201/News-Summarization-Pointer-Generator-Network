One woman is not ready to give up the search for the remaining yachter who is still missing ten days after his boat crashed during a race.

Niki Burgan has said that she will continue to look for the lone sailor who was on the 37-foot sailboat called the Aegean that crashed, leaving three of the four crewmembers dead.

'We're there to pick up the pieces when the other resource agencies have to call off,' she told NBC San Diego.

The boat's skipper, Theo Mavromatis, 49, remains missing.

The yacht was destroyed while racing from California to Mexico ended up on the rocky shore of an island just past the border.

Initially believed to have crashed into another boat, GPS tracking devices shows that the boat likely hit rocks instead.

Eric Lamb, who found the wreckage Saturday while on safety patrol, said debris strewn over 2 square miles looked as if the boat had ‘gone through a blender,’ with some of it a quarter-mile from the shore.

The San Diego County medical examiner said Kevin Eric Rudolph, 53, of Manhattan Beach and William Reed Johnson Jr., 57, of Torrance, both died from blunt force injuries. Rudolph's injuries were to his head and neck.

Joseph Lester Stewart, 64, of Bradenton, Fla., drowned, but head injuries contributed to his death. The boat's skipper, Theo Mavromatis, 49, remains missing.

The coroner's report listed all three deaths as accidents but did not say what could have caused the wreck.

Troy Sears, an experienced sailor who owns the San Diego-based charter company Next Level Sailing, said the GPS chart ‘gives an important clue if not verification of what happened to the vessel.’

‘It looked like they plotted a course for Ensenada and North Coronado Island was directly in the way.’

Sears, who visited the part of the island where the GPS tracking ended, said it was unlikely that the device fell off the boat because the chart shows a steady speed and straight course.

‘That section of North Coronado Island is near vertical and it would be like hitting a wall. There's no beach to stop or slow a vessel, so a vessel would make contact with a near-vertical wall,’ he said.

The deaths were the race's first fatalities in its 65 years and came two weeks after five sailors were killed in the waters off Northern California when their 38-foot yacht was hit by powerful waves and ran aground on a rocky island.

The family of the one missing sailor has reached out the Ms Burgan, thanking her for continuing her search.

She knows their pain, having lost her parents and sister when they died when a plane they were on crashed in the ocean. She has since founded SoCal H20 Rescue Team.

'We're there to help the families through it it and getting that message really solidified my mission and really made it worth it,' she said.
