A dodgy market trader has been caught selling perfume labelled as Chamele No 5.

The seller was caught flogging the bottles of perfume – a knock-off of the famous Chanel No 5 perfume - for £10 at Surrey Street Market in Croydon, south London.

The trader had marked up the 100ml bottles of perfume as being discounted from £96 - the price of a 100ml genuine bottle.

However, the fake bottles of perfume came to light after an unhappy customer complained to a market inspector about the spelling error on the box.

Police were called but the dealer managed to scarper before officers arrived on February 13.

The bottles of perfume were described by Trading Standards chiefs as being 'very poor counterfeits' with bottles 'labelled Chamele No 5' and intertwined circles rather than 'back-to-back capital Cs', featured in the famous Chanel trademark.

Chanel No 5 is the world's best-selling perfume, selling more than 10million bottles a year.

Its iconic status was sealed in 1953 when Marilyn Monroe said that all she wore to bed was 'two drops of Chanel No 5'.

Tony Newman, leader of Croydon Council, said: 'It's a shame this rogue chose to target Surrey Street for his criminal activities.

'Our historic market is the workplace of many good, decent traders, making an honest living, and they certainly don't want this sort of thing happening in their midst.

'It's a sad fact of life that there are people who are prepared to rip off others by producing vastly inferior goods and selling them as trusted brands at what appear to be bargain prices.

The fake perfume was brought to the attention of market inspectors after an unhappy customer pointed out the spelling error on the perfume bottle's logo. Police were called but the dealer escaped before officers arrived

Police managed to confiscate some of the bottles of perfume being sold by the market trader on February 13

'In truth, the goods are anything but a bargain.

'The old saying that 'if it looks too good to be true, it very probably is' should always be borne in mind.

'The sensible thing to do is to not buy the goods, and report the matter to the police at the earliest opportunity.

'Early reporting increases the chance of the crook being caught, and stops him hoodwinking other shoppers who might not be quite as alert.'

Taylor Harrison, 34, who lives in Croydon, said: 'Even Del Boy himself wouldn't make such a simple mistake.

'Chamele sounds more like the name of the guy's girlfriend rather than a world famous perfume.'

The market, which runs from Monday to Saturday, has been around since 1276 when it was granted a market charter by the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

The global counterfeit market has reached unprecedented levels with fake goods accounting for nearly 10 per cent of worldwide trade, according to the World Customs Organisation. 

In December, a trainee accountant ended up court after being caught selling fake Rolex watches and DVDs online under the name of his alter ego Rodney Trotter.

A covert sting operation was set up to catch Ryan Flood, after trading standards noticed his Facebook page - named after one of Only Fools and Horses' Trotter brothers - was selling dodgy goods. 

The 25-year-old was caught offering £150 worth of counterfeit goods including a Rolex watch for £20 and numerous DVDs.

In December last year, several discount stores across Britain were found to have been unknowingly selling fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo (pictured) , which contained some 'sex change' chemicals

In the same month, several discount stores across Britain were found to have been unknowingly selling fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo, which contain potentially dangerous ingredients including 'sex change' chemicals.

Thousands of counterfeit bottles of the top-selling haircare brand were seized by Trading Standards officers after customers began reporting side effects of itching and bleeding after using the products.

Tests carried out by scientists at Loughborough University revealed the fakes had a 'significantly different chemical make-up to the genuine product'.

An investigation found fake bottles of the leading shampoo brand had been on sale at two Trago Mills' stores in Cornwall and at a discount B&M store in Northern Ireland.

Leanne Wertheim appeared in court in 2012 after being caught using four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake cosmetics – including copies of Max Factor, Bobbi Brown and Benefit (pictured above)

Trading Standards officers said they were 'extremely good counterfeits' and said the discount stores could not be blamed for not realising they were fake goods. 

In 2012, Leanne Wertheim used four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake products – including copies of Max Factor and Bobbi Brown – to unsuspecting customers.

The 24-year-old, from south Wales, sold the fake goods despite them containing three times the legal amount of lead, which can cause brain damage.

She boasted the cosmetics were from high-end companies such as MAC, Benefit and Lancome, but they were in fact life-like counterfeits.
