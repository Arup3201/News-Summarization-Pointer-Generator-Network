For generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon.

But it seems the latest generation of Monopoly players are simply too busy for the full version of the game.

Instead its makers, Hasbro, have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players’ busy schedules.

Monopoly Empire is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span

Manufacturers say the new Monopoly Empire game, which is aimed at children of eight and older, is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours.

Either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice.

In America, makers of the US version 
of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they 
have even eliminated the jail, so children don’t waste time waiting to 
roll a double.

And Hasbro aren’t the only ones making their games quicker to play. 

As
a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call 
‘snack toys’ to appeal to children who have very little play time 
because of their action packed days.

Toy
manufacturers have been updating other games such as Scrabble and 
Boggle with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their 
increasingly distracted young customers.

How it used to be: Mother and son spending quality time together playing Monopoly - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even 'go to jail'

Thanks to its new incarnation as Scrabble Flash, it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of TV.

She said: ‘The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game.

‘With many families having both dad and mum out at work all day, evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games.

‘So at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives. However, as society isn’t going to change anytime soon, perhaps it is simple Monopoly being pragmatic.

‘If a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching TV or playing on the computer, then it would be welcomed by many parents.’

And it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with.

Last year a joined survey with Netmums and toy manufacturers Mattel questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year.

But it’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of Monopoly, in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board.

Hasbro, the world’s largest board game maker, has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as Mc Donalds, X-Box and Coca Cola which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of London.

Instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board.

The winner is the first to complete their skyscraper.

Computer games, toys, ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic Monopoly board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens

But Mrs Freegard maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game, it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older.

She added: ‘Lots of eight year olds also don’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience.

‘And if they enjoy the short version, it will encourage them to try the longer version, preserving an interest in board games for the next generation.’
