Children who grew up with parents addicted to drink and drugs have revealed the terrifying toll it took on their childhood.

While their homes should have been a place of safety and refuge, for Leanne and John (not their real names) they were associated with fear.

Her situation due to her often drunk single mother became so bad that Leanne, from London, ran away from home at the age of just 11.

Volatile: Leanne was so scared of her mother when she'd had a drink, she ran away age 11 preferring to sleep rough than be at home (pictures posed by models)

She told MailOnline: 'I never knew my dad and I was an 
only child. My mum and I led a very chaotic lifestyle: one year we lived in 12 
different places. The houses were all in bad condition and always dirty.

'My 
relationship with my mum wasn't good. She'd had two or three partners who she had turbulent 
relationships with. There were loads of rows, sometimes violent ones late into the night. Things were smashed and at the weekend she would 
drink heavily.

'I was frightened of her when she was drunk as she was 
very unpredictable. I was really stressed and not sleeping. I felt 
isolated. There was no-one to turn to, only my mum, and that wasn't 
working. It all got too much for me, I was utterly miserable, so I ran 
away from home. I was an 11-year-old girl wandering around by myself at night and I was scared.'    

She added: 'It was freezing and I was terrified that someone would hurt me. But frightened as I was, I couldn't face going home.'

It was thanks to Childline that she didn't have to sleep rough. They tried to help her reestablish a relationship with her mother but when that failed, they found her a refuge and then a foster home to stay in till she was 16.

...At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think "why can't I have that?"

She said: Through all those difficult years 
ChildLine was there for me. If they hadn't helped me when I ran away and
 I was alone in the park overnight I shudder to think what could have 
happened to me.

'Whenever things got really bad, I called them and they 
helped me through it. ChildLine always listened to me and believed what I
 said and having my counsellor at the end of the phone made me feel as 
though I mattered and there was always someone there for me. I really 
don't know what I would have done without ChildLine.'

Meanwhile, John's experience growing up with a drug addict father is equally heartbreaking.

John, from Grimsby, who is now 18, said: 'I
knew from a young age that my life was different to other children. I'd see my
dad fall over or just be asleep on the sofa by 6pm. I used to think "why is he
falling asleep, he's done nothing all day so why is he tired?" I'd sit next to
him and clap or make another noise, anything just to try and keep him awake as
I knew something wasn't right.

'We
always used to have lots of people in the house too. They'd arrive at weird times like 2am or 6am
and they'd be really noisy. My dad had told me that my mother was in prison for
drugs and I slowly began to realise as I got older that he was a drug user too.'

John said as a result of his father's problem, he lived in squalor and fear. But it was only when he went to a school friend's house that he realise how different his life was to his peers.

Concern: ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year

He said: 'I remember going to a friend's house and his family all sat up to be table for the meal and I thought "what are they doing?" I wasn't used to being in a family environment and spending time with family.

'At home our lives were very separate as I'd spend a lot of time in my room to get away from my dad and his friends who were taking drugs downstairs. He would never come and tuck me in, instead he'd pass out on the sofa.

He added: 'When I went to friends' houses I realised that they had more things than me, like playstations and mobiles, and I didn't understand why I couldn't have them. I felt lost and lonely.

'At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think "why can't I have that?" There was only a couple of friends who I trusted that came inside my house as I didn't want others to see what state it was in. Some of their parents wouldn't let me them come round as they knew my dad was doing drugs.'

John recalls one particularly horrific experience.

'When I was about nine, a man overdosed in my house. I remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood. I didn't know what to do and I was scared but my dad just told me to go to my room,' he said.

It was shortly after this that he found salvation via Childline. He was referred to the NSPCC's FEDUP programme which does group work with children whose parents have drug or alcohol problems.

He said: 'I was a bit nervous the first time I went as I knew why I was there but I didn't know what to expect. I loved it straight away as it helped me to realise that I wasn't the only person in that situation - other young people were going through the same thing.'

Leanne and John have shared her story after figures released today by Childline have shown a shock rise in the number of children contacting them about their parents' drinking and drug-taking.

The number of children counselled by ChildLine because their parents were drinking too much - or taking drugs - has more than doubled last year, averaging 15 counselling sessions a day to the free, 24-hour helpline.

ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year.

our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood

Most of the children counselled were 12 to 15 years old, although one in 10 were of primary school age.

The figures contrast with a long-term fall in violent crime in England and Wales, thought to be partially influenced by the rising cost of alcohol.

The charity said further research is needed to explain the sudden increase but it would appear that more children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home, or they are more aware that help is available.

Many children told ChildLine that they lived in fear of their parents' anger, with one in six saying they'd been physically hurt by their mother or father when they were under the influence.

Some reported living in dirty and even dangerous surroundings, lacking essentials because money was frittered on alcohol or drugs.

Children spoke of feeling helpless and not knowing where to go for support.

Shock rise: More children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home according to statistics from Childline (posed by models)

Sue Minto, Head of ChildLine, said: 'These shocking ChildLine statistics are sadly only one small piece of the jigsaw. Official estimates are that more than 250,000 children in the UK have parents with drug problems, and three in 10 children live with at least one binge-drinking parent.    

'It's heart-breaking that so many young people struggle alone because they do not know where to go for help or are unsure of what might happen if they speak to someone. They may fear being taken away from their families by social services and put into care and believe that they are protecting their family by keeping quiet.

'Some children tell us their parents are under stress and it may be that they are using drink and drugs to blot out worries about jobs, money or housing issues. But whatever the reasons behind the rise, it's vital that anyone who knows a parent with drink or drug problems takes action to get that family help so that their children are protected.'

John said the support of the charity was invaluable to him. He explained: 'It was good to have the NSPCC in my life as they provided me with a consistency that was missing at home and gave me someone to talk to.

'Going there made me want to help other people and I started to help deliver the FEDUP sessions to other young people. I’m also going to university to do a social worker degree.'

Children can seek help by contacting ChildLine on 0800 1111 or at childline.org.uk. Adults with concerns about a child should call the NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000.
