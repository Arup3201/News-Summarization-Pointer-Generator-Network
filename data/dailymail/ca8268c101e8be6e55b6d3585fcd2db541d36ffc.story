When an invite drops through your letterbox with a picture
of a scantily clad woman holding a leather whip you really have to consider
going.

And when the invite turns out to be the launch of luxury erotic
retailer Box Of Grey BXG promising stunning models wearing corsets and wielding
riding crops and spanking paddles, then you’d be a fool to miss it.

Clearly I wasn't the only one who thought this as the
roof top party at the Sanctum Soho Hotel was packed full of London's naughtiest and sauciest
clubbers.

Revealing: The Celebrity Big Brother star tried on a seductive red lace Sian Hoffman corset

It was only a matter of time before the party guests started cracking
open the trademark grey BXG flight cases to try out the high-end sex toys and
lingerie.

I was accosted by the stunning Box Of Grey model Tessa Kuragi
with a riding crop and I've still got the welt marks to prove it.

Tight leather
was certainly the dress code for the night – Tessa wore a leather corset and
the gorgeous MailOnline Femail Editor Deborah Arthurs wore a rather fetching
pair of leather trews. It's possible I may have been caught admiring them for a
little longer than is deemed polite.

I'm pretty sure Deborah was aware of it, seeing as she
tweeted me this message earlier today:

Downstairs the luxurious Sanctum room 404 had been
transformed into the BXG suite – the King size bed was strewn with bed
restraints, leather masks, manacles and peephole bras. The last time I saw
that amount of lacy undies in one space was at the Bluebella lingerie counter
at Selfridges.

The La Fée Absinthe cocktails were flowing and the party was
starting to get interesting. Celeb Big Brother star Luisa Zissman stripped off
and tried on a seductive red lace Sian Hoffman corset. Here's the photograph to
prove it, apologies if it's a bit grainy but it's the best that could be
achieved in the low light of the boudoir.

Russ Kane and Stacey Jackson were also at the launch party of erotic brand Box of Grey

Casey Batchelor
was also getting in the swing of things and posed for a snap blowing a kiss in to a mirror - Spencer couldn’t
quite make out what was written on the mirror in lipstick but it looked pretty
rude

Time to hit the road: Spencer leaves complete with naughty goodie bag

Luisa was also a little bit too fond of the BXG riding crop
as you can see in this shot of me with singer Stacey Jackson.

Luisa's fellow Celeb Big Brother party guest Casey Batchelor
was also getting in the swing of things and was chatting with Sanctum Hotel
owner Mark Fuller. Mark was showing a surprising
degree of restraint (for him) when he refused to be photographed with Casey on
the bed with leather hand-cuffs.

But
Casey did oblige in posing for a snap blowing a kiss in the mirror. I couldn’t
quite make out what was written on the mirror in lipstick but it looked pretty
rude.

Things were starting to get a little out of hand - even by
the standards of London's rock 'n' roll Sanctum hotel. I decided to call it a
night but made sure I picked up a BXG goodie bag on the way out. There were a
couple of items that might make rather interesting presents for any future lady
friends.

Lots of love, Spencer xxx
