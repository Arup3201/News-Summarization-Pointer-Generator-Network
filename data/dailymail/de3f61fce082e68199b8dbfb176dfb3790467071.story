Dermot Drummy is a name not many fans of Crystal Palace will recognise but the 53-year-old is as low as 5/1 with some bookmakers to become the next manager at Selhurst Park.

It is believed he is back on the radar after talks last week and is a genuine option for Palace co-owner Steve Parish despite being a relative unknown.

Because scratching a little deeper shows Drummy has coaching credentials to rival the early career of Brendan Rodgers, and some of the big names in the Premier League have been assisted by his guiding hand.

Who is he? Drummy has worked for Arsenal and Chelsea and is being considered for the vacant Palace job

Enough of all that – just who is he?

Drummy is the international head coach at Chelsea

Sounds a little like Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.

Sure, not quite. Instead his role is to teach the coaches from the Chelsea Foundation across the globe, notably at soccer schools in China and America. 

But before that he was in charge of Chelsea’s successful youth team.

Tell me more…

Drummy originally joined Chelsea from Arsenal’s academy in 2008 and assisted Paul Clement on the side’s run to that year's FA Youth Cup final. 

He took over when Clement moved up to become assistant to Guus Hiddink (then Carlo Ancelotti) and then oversaw the development of the likes of Ryan Bertrand and Romelu Lukaku.

What was his record like?

In his first full season in the job he brought the FA Youth Cup to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1961, beating Aston Villa over two legs and then took over Steve Holland’s position as reserve team manager, incorporating the two roles.

Well done: Drummy congratulates Chelsea U21 captain Lewis Baker during a successful season 

In 2012/13 his team reached the NextGen Series final, beating Barcelona, Ajax, Juventus and Arsenal beaten before losing to Villa in Italy, and last season he lifted the Under-21 Premier League by defeating Manchester City and Manchester United. His career management record stands at 51 per cent.

It is claimed he is the most decorated development coach in Chelsea’s history, ahead of Rodger, Clement, Holland and Steve Clarke.

All sound very impressive, has he any first-team experience?

Yes. Jose Mourinho has entrusted him with coaching duties during international breaks, with the likes of John Terry, Frank Lampard, and Eden Hazard under his guidance.

Trust: Under Jose Mourinho Drummy was left alone to coach the likes of John Terry and Eden Hazard

Did he have any playing career himself?

Indeed he did. He began at Arsenal aged 13, playing in the same youth sides as Paul Davis and Chris Whyte, later a league champion with Leeds, but was released six years later. 

He moved to Blackpool in Division Two and then went semi-professional at Hendon, Wealdstone and Enfield, retiring at 35.

Development: Both Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere were coached by Drummy in his time at Arsenal

As an apprentice he had cleaned the boots of Liam Brady, who by now was academy director at Arsenal and offered his former friend a job coaching the Under-16s.

Drummy would coach Jermaine Pennant, Johan Djourou, Nicklas Bendtner and more recently Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs.
