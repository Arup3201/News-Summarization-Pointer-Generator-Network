A self-proclaimed member of 'Hitler's Order' from New Jersey lost custody of his son after he argued the state made no effort to find a psychologist to interview him who was not Jewish.

An appeals court labeled the man's arguments 'unpersuasive.'

The Hunterdon County man is identified in court papers by a fictitious name Ian and the initials I.H.C. to protect the identity of the 3-year-old boy, known by the factious name Henry.

Hateful: A self-proclaimed member of 'Hitler's Order' from New Jersey (not pictured) has lost custody of his 3-year-old son after he argued the state made no effort to find a psychologist to interview him who was not Jewish

The child was removed from his parents shortly after he was born in November 2011. 

The boy's mother, named in court filings as Daisy, surrendered her parental rights last year.

The state had terminated the father's parental rights of three older children in 2012.

The Courier News of Bridgewater reported the man argued the state made 'no effort to find an alternative psychologist' who was not Jewish.

According to court papers, the state said it attempted to provide the man with anger management, domestic violence and marital counseling. But the state said he refused to comply.

The court said the man failed to respond to notices and didn't attend a court hearing because he said he was fearful for his life. 

Ian said he did not trust law enforcement to protect him because 'law enforcement doesn't care about someone with Swastikas and tattoos.'

The father (not pictured), identified by the fictitious name 'Ian,' said he didn't trust law enforcement to protect him because 'law enforcement doesn't care about someone with Swastikas and tattoos'

One of his tattoos reads, 'I hate DYFS,' which stands for 'Division of Youth and Family Services' - the former name of Division of Child Protection and Permanency. 

In his appeal of the state's decision to terminate his custody, Ian argued that the state failed to convey to him that his participation in counseling programs was necessary for him to keep his son. 

Ian reportedly told a caseworker that he wanted to go to 'federal buildings,' where he believed he had a better shot at winning his case.

Court filings from 2010 described Ian as an abused child whose medical and psychological disabilities resulted in his being illiterate and unemployed his entire life.
