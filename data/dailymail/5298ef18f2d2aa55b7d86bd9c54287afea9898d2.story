A grandfather was battered to death when he went to help a landlord who was tackling a gang 'spoiling for a fight' outside his pub.

Ray Cannon, 52, was set upon as he backed up his friend Bernard Roberts when a group of customers refused to take bottles and glasses back inside the bar.

During the unprovoked attack, the victim, a self employed plasterer, was punched by two men and hit his head on the ground when he fell. He died at the scene shortly afterwards.

Tragedy: Ray Cannon, pictured with his wife Jayne, was battered to death when he went to the aid of his landlord friend who was tackling vicious louts

His killing happened 11 weeks before Mr Cannon, who was married with three children and two grandchildren, was due to walk his daughter down the aisle.

Today Matthew Hancock and Callum Belfield, both 22, were branded 'scumbags' by friends and family of the dead man as they were jailed for four years after they admitted manslaughter.

A third man, Shane Davies, 21, was jailed for 12 months for affray after he admitted throwing a bottle at Mr Roberts.

The tragedy occurred on May 10 last year after 'much-loved family man' Mr Cannon of Biddulph, Staffordshire, had been out with his friend.

Sentencing: Matthew Hancock, left, and friend Callum Bellfield, right, admitted the manslaughter of hero grandfather Ray Cannon and were both jailed for more than four years

At 11.40pm they returned to the Jester pub, which Mr Roberts owned, to find Hancock and Belfield and their friends drinking in the car park.

Victim: Ray Cannon had been out with friends when he was punched and could not be revived

Mr Roberts asked them to take their glasses and bottles inside but the mob became aggressive.

Hancock punched Mr Cannon in the head, knocking him off backwards. As he fell Belfield threw a second punch, knocking him to the ground and causing him to fall unconscious.

He died despite attempts to revive him.

A post mortem was unable to establish whether Mr Cannon was killed by a punch to the face or by banging his head on the floor following the impact.

In a statement read to the court, his widow Jayne Cannon who had been his childhood sweetheart said: 'I am alone. I have to face the rest of my life without the man who had been in my life since I was 14.'

Stafford Crown Court was told Belfield, who was jailed for four years and three months, had written a letter to the court which referred to Ray's death as an 'accident'.

He claimed he was 'bitterly and deeply sorry'.

Father-of-two Hancock, who was jailed for four and a half years, claimed he expressed 'real regret and apology for the devastation he has caused.'

But Judge Simon Tonking told them: 'There can be no doubt that Mr Cannon did nothing to provoke the attack which led to his death. It is plain from the CCTV footage that you were aggressive and spoiling for a fight.

'It is true that the consequences of what you did were not what you intended. But that does not alter the fact that what happened and its consequences were not an accident but a deliberate act of violence which caused a man to lose his life.'

Addressing Ray's family, Judge Tonking added: 'You have suffered a loss which cannot be recompensed or compensated for by any sentence passed by any court.'

Gang: Matthew Hancock and Callum Belfield set upon Mr Cannon because they were 'spoiling for a fight', and their victim's family said they were 'disgusted' by their sentences

But after the case Mr Cannon's father Ray snr, 74, said: 'We are absolutely disgusted with the sentence. Just over a four years for my son's life is nothing. Ray was a top man, a great family man and one of the best.'

Family friend Steve Turner, 50 said: 'Ray was a perfect gentleman and a real character.

'There are some real scumbags on this earth and Ray was the last person who deserved any of this. There was no harm in him at all.'

Pub landlord Gary Pearson said: 'We all lost a friend that night. Ray was very well liked. He was very quiet and always very polite - a real gentleman.'

Det Chief Inspector Darren Harding, of Staffordshire Police said: 'What turned out to be a typical Friday night out with friends sadly ended in tragedy.

'Mr Cannon got caught up in a spur of the moment incident which escalated out of control. Our thoughts remain with Mr Cannon's family at this very difficult time.'
