A woman who dressed as a nurse and 
abducted a three-day-old boy from a Pittsburgh hospital in a handbag was 
sentenced today to up to five years in prison.

'All I wanted to do was love someone,' Breona Moore told the Allegheny County judge who sentenced her in Pennsylvania. She was also given ten years' 
probation.

Moore, 21, of East McKeesport, told friends 
for weeks that she was pregnant and had given birth before buying 
$16 hospital scrubs and pretending to be a nurse at Magee-Womens Hospital of
 UPMC in August 2012, prosecutors said.

Breona Moore, 21, was sentenced to up to five years in prison after she posed as a nurse and stole a baby from a Pennsylvania hospital in 2012

Safe: Bryce Coleman was found safe five hours after he was stolen from his mother in the hospital in 2012

Moore 
was able to take three-day-old Bryce Coleman by entering the mother's room and telling her 
the child needed to be taken for a medical test, authorities said.

Moore
 was 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, but relatives doubted the pregnancy and 
called police when they heard about the kidnapping on the news.

Police
 found Moore hiding in the closet of a downtown office building a few 
hours later, holding the baby. The baby wasn't harmed.

Moore
 had pleaded guilty to the charges in April. Defense attorney Blaine 
Jones said Moore was 'remorseful' and 'taking ownership' of her crimes.

Deputy District Attorney Janet Necessary argued for prison, despite Moore's somewhat pathetic circumstances.

'This was not an impulse or spur-of-the-moment thing,' Necessary said. 'The defendant made a detailed plan.'

Moore
 told the judge she became depressed after a doctor told her she'd be 
unable to have children.

She apologized for her actions, and to the 
baby's mother, who wasn't in the courtroom.

'I hope I will be as blessed as you some day,' Moore said. 'There are no words to say how remorseful I am.'

At the time of her arrest, Moore 
smiled broadly for TV cameras and blamed her mother, father and 
boyfriend for the kidnapping as she was led away in handcuffs.

Moore
 had the newborn for about five hours after the kidnapping, which set 
off a frantic search by police and the staff at Magee-Womens Hospital. 
He was found safe when police discovered Moore hiding in a stair well in
 an office building near the hospital.

Authorities say Moore walked into a uniform shop across the street from the hospital the day she kidnapped the boy and purchased a black nurse scrub top with the hospital's logo on it.

The top was priced at $17.99, but she claimed she worked at the hospital and received a 10-percent discount. Her final price for the nurse's uniform -- $16.19, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Disguised as a nurse, Moore walked into the hospital and wandered the halls, before finding Rhonda King, 27, in her hospital room with Bryce, her newborn son.

'She said she was taking the baby to get a checkup, that she would bring the baby right back,' Thelma Broughton, Bryce's grandmother, told the Post-Gazette at the time.

Ms King willingly handed over the infant, believing Moore was a nurse. 'But she never came back,' Ms Broughton said.

Bryce is Ms King's fifth child.

Authorities said Moore walked around the hospital with the child for 15 to 30 minutes before cutting off the infant's radio monitor tag and walking out the door with him. 

When Bryce was not returned to Ms King, she called hospital staff, who realize the infant had been taken.

Police
 found the child after Moore's family called detectives and said they 
feared she may have taken the child.  Moore's parents said she claimed 
that she was pregnant and became enraged when no one believed her.  Police believe she might have stolen the child to prove to them that she was pregnant.
