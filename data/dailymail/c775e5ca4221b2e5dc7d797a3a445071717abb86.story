A Maine man charged with killing and dismembering his father was ordered Thursday to undergo a mental health evaluation at a court appearance that ended with him declaring himself 'the Lord, Father of life' and asking the gathered media to follow him on Twitter.

Leroy Smith III, 24, 'stated that he filleted 
him and buried him in the woods because his dad sexually assaulted him 
his whole life,' an investigator wrote.

A police affidavit said Smith told an officer he killed his father, Leroy Smith Jr, 56, by stabbing him in the neck then used three knives to chop up his body.

Smith told an investigator he recorded at least
 some of the crime and posted it on YouTube and Twitter, but removed the
 postings and deleted the video from his camera and computer, according 
to court records.

The
 defendant, who's being held without bail, did not enter a plea during 
the hearing. Leaving the courtroom, he told reporters, 'I am the Lord, Father of life.'

The
 Associated Press does not generally identify potential victims of 
sexual abuse. However, Smith later gave an interview to WGME-TV in which
 he said he wanted to tell his story.

In the interview, Smith confessed to the killing and suggested he did it for attention. 'I did this to get my name out there. How else will I get the attention of yourself?' he said. 'I'm a no one sitting up here in Maine.'

According
 to the Maine Press Herald, the affidavit revealed grisly details of the
 killing, disclosing that Smith stabbed his father in the jugular vein 
and dismembered him, spreading his remains among 16 trash bags.

Smith told police that he videotaped the killing and that the FBI 'told him to put a video of the event on YouTube' but he later deleted the video.

He then make multiple trips to a local store to buy cleaning products including ammonia and bleach, even renting a carpet steamer to hid the evidence.

Smith told police that he initially threw his father's remains into a Dumpster outside the apartment building, but retrieved them when they weren't taken away.

He transferred the bags to a car and drove to Richmond, dumping them off Lincoln St. He told police he planned to return and bury his father's remains on Monday.

His Twitter profile Thursday morning appeared to show a photo of Smith giving an obscene hand gesture. His last tweets, written on Sunday, include 'I have no magic!' and '... you have some spare time on your hands, and my father is dead (he is done writing songs for you most of the time).'

In one Facebook post he declared that he’s the ‘head of the KKK’.

On Monday, Smith flagged down a police officer and asked directions to a strip club. The officer looked the young man up and discovered an outstanding arrest warrant in Massachusetts.

Police said the case developed quickly 
after the officer 
arrested him on the fugitive warrant. Smith blurted out that he killed his 
father at the jail, according to a state police detective.

According to the Maine Press Herald, Smith 'made excited utterances that he killed his father' while at the jail. 

Police found body parts in 16 dark trash bags, and a T-shirt and other blood-stained clothing off Lincoln Street in Richmond, according to the affidavit. One of the first bags to be opened contained a jeans-clad human leg.

The younger man led investigators to his father's body using a signed map and verbal instructions, police said.

Charges were filed Tuesday after the medical examiner's report found his father died of multiple stab wounds to the head and neck.
