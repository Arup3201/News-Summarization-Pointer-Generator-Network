Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has called for calm amid the crisis of form engulfing his struggling side.

Dortmund go into Tuesday's Champions League clash at home to Galatasaray second bottom of the Bundesliga after five straight league defeats, the latest a 2-1 reverse at Bayern Munich.

It is a remarkably poor run for a team who were Champions League finalists in 2013, made even more so by the fact Klopp's side are flying in Europe. They have won three out of three in Group D, including a 4-0 win in Istanbul during their series of league losses.

The run of defeats has turned up the heat on Klopp, one of the most high-rated coaches in Europe.

'Calmness helps in a difficult moment,' he said in the pre-match press conference. 'I feel it and I will try to use it.

'We have to focus only on the next game, even if it is difficult.

'We have to tune out the game on Sunday against Borussia Monchengladbach for 90 minutes.'

Victory over Gala would guarantee Dortmund's place in the knockout stage with two group games to spare, while a draw could also do so.

It would not, though, ease the pressure on the side for the league clash with Gladbach, especially with only goal difference keeping them off the foot of the table.

The latest loss to leaders Bayern was particularly hard to swallow, with Dortmund leading for most of the game, only for their former striker Robert Lewandowski to equalise and Arjen Robben to score the winner with a penalty five minutes from time.

Klopp feels it is only small details which are proving the difference between their league and Champions League form.

'In the Champions League we have made fewer individual mistakes than in the Bundesliga,' he said.

Gala have taken just one point from their opening three games and appear to be in a fight with Anderlecht for third place.
