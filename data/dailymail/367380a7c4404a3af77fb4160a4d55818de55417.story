The remains of Miss Wells-Burr were 
recovered after a motorist raised the alarm about a vehicle burning in a
field in Ashill, near Ilminster, Somerset, last week.

A police spokesman said: 'Detectives 
investigating the murder of Catherine Wells-Burr have charged another 
person with conspiracy to murder.

'Rafal Nowak, aged 31, will appear at 
Bristol magistrates court tomorrow. A 38-year-old man remains in police 
custody where he is being questioned.'

Earlier today, Lagwinowicz, a Polish 
national, made a brief appearance before magistrates charged with 
conspiring together with other persons to murder Miss Wells-Burr between
May 1, 2012 and September 13, 2012.

The defendant, of Taunton, Somerset, 
spoke only to confirm her name age and adress before JPs. She was 
remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown Court on October 9.

No application for bail was made and reporting restrictions were not lifted.

Miss Wells-Burr’s body was discovered 
by firefighters who had been alerted to the blazing five-door vehicle by
passing motorists shortly before 6.30am off the A358 in Ashill on 
September 12.

Avon and Somerset Police have appealed for witnesses, describing the death as 'tragic and brutal'.

Detective
Inspector Simon Crisp, who is leading the inquiry said: 'I am still 
extremely keen to speak to a number of people who have not yet come 
forward.

Police described the death as a 'tragic and brutal incident in which a young woman has needlessly lost her life.'

'We know that there
were many motorists that passed the site of this crime on Wednesday 
morning, and those people may have information that could help us.

'I
would ask that you come forward and speak with us no matter how small 
you think your information may be, please let us decide.

'It
is also important that we speak with anyone who may have been in the 
area between 3am and 6am on Wednesday, using the roads between Chard and
Ashill.

'Did you see a red 
Ford Focus, 5 door hatch back that may have been in company with another
vehicle? If you did, please contact us.'

Police were called to the vehicle at 6.30am on Wednesday. Firemen extinguished the inferno and discovered the body inside.

Miss
Wells-Burr’s family have released her graduation photo and paid tribute
to a ‘special person’ who had been excited about her future with Nowak.

In a
statement, her mother Jayne, father Phil, sister Leanne and Mr Nowak 
said: ‘We have lost our beautiful Catherine; she was full of character, 
she was caring, loving, and had a bubbly personality.

‘She had a wonderful sense of humour, and was an amazing, special person.

‘Catherine had achieved so much in her short life and had worked so hard to gain her bachelor of honours in business management, gaining a first class degree from Bath Spa University.

‘She was so happy starting her life with Rafal and excited about their future together.

‘We would like to express thanks for all the messages of sympathy and support. We have found some comfort in all the kind and thoughtful words that have been said about Catherine and in knowing how well she was loved.

‘We have found this hard to understand why someone would have done this to her.

‘There are no words to express how we feel about what has happened to her early on Wednesday morning. We desperately need to know why. She will be sadly missed.’

Intelligent: Ms Wells-Burr, who lived in Chard, Somerset with her family, studied business management at Bath Spa University and passed with first-class honours

Grieving friends placed bouquets of flowers at the spot where her burning car was discovered.

One
heartfelt message read: 'RIP Beautiful. Catherine (Caf), it is hard to 
believe that you have cruelly been taken from everyone at such a young 
age.

'You were always such a happy-go-lucky kind of girl, so how can someone be so cold-hearted towards you?

'We
may not have spoken out of school but I'm glad to say that I had the 
privilege to meet such a kind caring intelligent young woman.

'Your life was only really about to start, with so many things to look forwards to.

'You
will always be missed. It's nice to see everyone thought so highly of 
you. Keep smiling, we will find who done this to you sweetie. Rest in 
peace Caf.

'All my love to you and your family, Becky Wood.

'We didn't lose a life, we gained an angel.'

Another
tribute left at the sad scene read: 'Caf, rest in peace lovely lady. We
will always remember you and your smile. You have been taken too soon 
from us all.

'Thinking of you, your family and your friends at this sad time. Heaven has gained an angel. Sleep well, we will never forget.

'Lots of love Gem Shaw and family and Chris Fox.'

A third message left on flowers said: 'Dear Caf, you were taken away far too young and in such a horrible way.

'You were always a beautiful caring loving girl.

'I will never forget the laughs we had together, mainly in the pub, and mostly I will never ever forget you.

'You'll always be in my thoughts. Sleep tight angel. Sending you and your family all my love, RIP, Lucy Knight.'

Another sad friend simply wrote: 'Caf, this isn't fair. Words fail me. Sleep well. Xxx'
