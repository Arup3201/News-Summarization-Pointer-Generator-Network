A biker has been banned from the roads after he crashed pulling a 70mph wheelie which was captured on two different cameras.

Lee Oliver's headcam  filmed the moment he was flung from his bike and into the path of an oncoming van - which by pure coincidence had a camera fitted to the dashboard.

The 38-year-old has now been banned from driving for four years and fined £1,000 after a court heard he and a friend had filmed themselves reaching speeds of 130mph. 

Idiot: Motorcyclist Lee Oliver was captured on two cameras crashing as he attempted this wheelie at 70mph

Tumble: Oliver, who was hurled from his bike and into the path of an oncoming van, suffered minor injuries

End of the road: The 38-year-old  was banned from driving for four years and made to pay £1,700 to the courts

Oliver was racing his friend Lee Cunningham, 39, other along country roads in Uckfield, East Sussex, on May 15 last year when he attempted the stunt.

The pair from Horsham, West Sussex, had recorded their entire journeys including their speedometers - which meant police could prove what speeds they hit.

Oliver clocked 130mph and Cunningham reached 137mph, including riding at triple the speed limit in a 30mph zone, Lewes Crown Court heard.

Oliver then attempted the wheelie on a straight section of road and was hurled from his bike. 

Despite the van driver slamming on his brakes so quickly he was struck from behind, Oliver smashed into the vehicle and tumbled down the road for another 45ft.

Remarkably he suffered only minor injuries. 

Both bikers were banned from driving for four years after they admitting dangerous driving.

They were also each handed 18-month suspended prison sentences, ordered to work 200 hours unpaid, fined £1,000 and made to pay £700 costs. 

Sergeant Huw Watts, from the Surrey and Sussex roads policing unit, said: 'When you watch the video, it seems amazing that Oliver escaped with just minor injuries and concussion.

'If he had come off his bike just seconds later he could have gone under the wheels of the van and been seriously injured or even killed.

Tumble: Police said Oliver was just seconds from being flung under the van's wheels and killed

'Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users who usually come off worst when they are involved in a collision but this case shows how some can put themselves at risk by abusing the fact that their machines can go fast and perform stunts.

'Every road user needs to think whether they are putting themselves in unnecessary danger and what they can do to avoid a trip to hospital.

'The roads are no place for stunts or speeding.'
