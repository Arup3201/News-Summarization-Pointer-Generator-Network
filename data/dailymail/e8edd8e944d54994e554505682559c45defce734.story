Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's unequivocal public support of his players in the face of criticism can only galvanise the squad for the challenges ahead, according to former Blues defender Frank Sinclair.

Mourinho has been fined £25,000 and warned over his future conduct by the Football Association for claiming there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea earlier in the season.

Following the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg win over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, the Portuguese manager vehemently defended striker Diego Costa, who could face an immediate three-match suspension after subsequently being charged for an apparent stamp on Reds defender Emre Can.

Sinclair, an ambassador for the Prostate Cancer UK Men United Campaign, believes Mourinho's stance will only serve to make the Chelsea dressing room stronger.

'Jose is a master of mind games, and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality. He has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him, and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction,' said Sinclair.

'When he has a press conference, he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him. When you speak to the players, that is the spirit they have got.'

While Sinclair, 43, believes the Blues have what it takes to see off a City side beaten at home by Arsenal in their last league match, he warned against any complacency over what the run-in could yet bring.

'It will be a tough game, but on the back of a great win in midweek, I would fancy Chelsea to get the result against Manchester City,' said Sinclair, who played more than 160 games for Chelsea between 1990 and 1998.

'As for the title, Manchester City have already pegged back a nine-point lead earlier in the season, so all it takes is for Chelsea to have another blip and all of a sudden City are back in the ball game.

'However, if Chelsea do win on Saturday, then you would not bet against them going on to win the championship with that advantage.'

Chelsea will face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on March 1.

Sinclair feels while the west London club have more pressing targets, to get a trophy back in the Stamford Bridge cabinet would only serve to inspire the players for the bigger challenges which await.

'It can breed confidence and be a spring board to what the main aims are for the season,' said Sinclair, who was part of Ruud Gullit's Chelsea side which won the FA Cup in 1997 and then also the League Cup the following season under new Blues manager Gianluca Vialli before joining Leicester.

'The priority will, of course, be to win the Premier League and go as far as possible in the Champions League, but for the likes of people like Diego Costa, who have come to the Premier League for the first time to play in such a big game at Wembley will stay with him for the rest of his life.'

One of the latest initiatives from Prostate Cancer UK will see The Anchor Bankside pub, on London's South Bank, be temporarily known as 'The Men United Arms' from where activities will be run to help celebrate and inspire male friendships.

Sinclair lost his uncle to prostate cancer seven years ago, and is determined to help beat the disease.

He said: 'When you are in the sports industry, you almost feel you are invincible. You live the life of keeping fit naturally, training and playing, you kind of take it for granted, but at the same time you can't be aware of something that is not visible, so it is important to get the check-ups, especially if there is a history in the family.'
