James Ward fell in the final round of qualifying at the US Open for the second straight year.

The British number two has been in arguably the best form of his career and arrived in New York at a career-high ranking of 131.

He looked to have a golden chance to complete his set of grand slam main draw appearances against world No 205 Radu Albot, but it was the Moldovan who came through 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.

Ward made a faltering start and comprehensively dropped the first set to the consistent Albot.

He fought back well in the second and they had played one game of the third when rain began to fall and kept the pair away from the court for two hours.

It was an untimely break for Ward and he never got going on the resumption, throwing in a poor game to be broken for 3-1.

Albot was denied victory on his first match point by the umpire's over-rule but took his second to clinch a deserved win and a spot in the main draw of a grand slam for the first time.

It has been a disappointing qualifying tournament for the British players, with the other four entrants all losing in the first round.

Ward must now hope for withdrawals from the main draw that would give him a chance of getting in as a lucky loser.

Ireland's James McGee defied cramp and missed opportunities to defeat Zhang Ze and qualify for the main draw of the US Open. 

It is the first time the 27-year-old has come through qualifying at a grand slam and there was no shortage of drama on a packed Court 8 at Flushing Meadows during his 0-6 6-4 6-4 victory.
