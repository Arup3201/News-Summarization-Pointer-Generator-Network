The reward for information leading to a missing 21-year-old West Chester University has reached $50,000.

Shane Montgomery, a senior at the suburban school, was last seen getting kicked out of Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia around 2am November 28 and hasn't been seen since.

His mother, Karen Montgomery, announced the latest increase in the reward on Saturday as she turned to NFL fans for help in the search.

'I just need that one courageous person to come forward with information about Shane.' 

Volunteers have been aiding local authorities in the search.

Police say Montgomery was home for Thanksgiving when he met up  with some friends  at the crowded Kildare's bar.

Authorities say he became separated from them and was escorted out by a bouncer around 2am Thursday after stumbling on a bar stool. 

In the wake of his disappearance, Jim Townsend, the director of operations at Kildare's, came forward to shed light on what happened when Montgomery was last seen.

A search of the records at the bar turned up a tab for Montgomery totaling $17, which Townsend said was for three craft beers.

He said that Montgomery did not appear intoxicated and though he bumped into the DJ table accidentally, he was polite about it.

Missing: Montgomery's cellphone pinged near the CVS Pharmacy, located less than a mile from Kildare's, about an hour after he was last seen at the bar, but that signal could be picked up at a radius of 4,500 feet

An employee at Kildare's, who is a relative of Montgomery's, walked him to the exit around closing time and security saw him leave the door and turn south on Main Street.

Montgomery's cellphone pinged near the CVS Pharmacy, located less than a mile from Kildare's, about an hour after he was last seen at the bar, but that signal could be picked up at a radius of 4,500 feet. 

'My heart is broken,' Shane's mother told NBC Philadelphia shortly after her son's disappearance.

'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder,' added Shane's father, Kevin.

On November 29, about 200 volunteers helped search Main Street in Manayunk and the nearby banks of the Schuylkill  River.

Authorities have used K-9s, helicopters and marine units as part of the search.

The search was so widespread that the city cancelled a Christmas tree lighting ceremony and caroling activities. 

Instead the organization held a candlelight vigil at the Canal View Park.

Montgomery is a liberal arts major and a former high school runner. 

He is 5-foot-11 and 130 pounds, with short brown hair and green eyes.

He was wearing a buttoned- down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar.

He also has a unique Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder.
