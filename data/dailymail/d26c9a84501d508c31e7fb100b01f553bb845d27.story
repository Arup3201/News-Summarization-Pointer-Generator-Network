Of all the images England’s suffering supporters will take home from 
the loss of the Ashes Down Under, the sight of Ian Bell dragging himself
from the pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground carrying his bat upside 
down might just turn out to be the one that survives the longest.

In
the English summer series, Bell was the batting rock on which England 
built their 3-0 win, with 562 runs, including three hundreds at Trent 
Bridge, Lord’s and the Riverside: brilliant, confident and consistent 
performances which team-mates and opponents alike understood might have 
papered over a variety of cracks.

On day three of the fourth Test at the MCG, his dismissal from the first delivery of his second innings, caught at mid-off by Mitchell  Johnson off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, and his slow march back to the pavilion underlined the state of utter confusion in the minds of  England’s batsmen.

Their batting stalwart from the Sixties and former coach Kenny Barrington, a magnificent jumbler of popular terms, once called the condition ‘caught in two man’s land’. Hard to better that here.

Indeed, such was the collective loss of marbles England suffered in collapsing not once in a second innings lasting just 61 overs, but twice as they slumped from 65 for no wicket to 179 all out, that some unkind observers might suggest they may as well all try using the bat upside down for what remains of the series.

England had produced some beauties before they arrived in Melbourne: six for nine runs and seven for 49 in the first Test in Brisbane and four for six in Adelaide the best of them.

But losing three wickets for one run in six balls, then squandering their last five for six runs in a sorry, overall surrender of eight wickets for seven runs, when attempting to convert a first innings lead of 51 into a match-winning position was something else.

And no matter how the rest of the series pans out here and in Sydney next week, the manner of so many of the dismissals, ranging from the brainless to the brain-dead, not only indicates just how mentally shot Alastair Cook’s men are but how much work is required to fashion a side capable of winning back the urn in 18 months’ time.

Hard to credit it, but the outcome could have been even worse had Australia taken another golden opportunity to dismiss Kevin Pietersen when he had scored just nine of the 49 runs which, in the main, he had earned with great skill, patience and focus until he ran out of patience and partners.

If Peter Siddle had hit any of the three stumps he had to aim at when Ben Stokes called his partner for an imaginary single at 102-4, Pietersen would have been run out by the best part of three yards and the match might not even have lasted until day four.

Pietersen and Cook can be exempted from some of the criticism. The 
skipper batted more fluently than at any other time in the tour for his 
fifty before Johnson did him for pace at 65-1.

Pietersen showed once 
again that he does have the flexibility of approach to adapt his game to
the needs of the side and the context of the match, the sadness being 
that it seems to have taken him until now even to accept the possibility
that he might need to.

Michael Carberry, lbw to Siddle, battled well
for just over two hours without looking as though he would ever make it
to 20. Jonny Bairstow hit out briefly against Lyon before Johnson had 
him caught behind.

Far better batsmen than Monty Panesar have been 
nowhere near good enough to survive the kind of delivery with which 
Johnson claimed his 31st wicket of the series.

But the rest of the 
dismissals betrayed techniques and minds stretched beyond the point of 
no return, from Joe Root’s mad and ultimately successful attempt to run 
himself out at 86-2, Bell’s half-push, half-block at 86-3, Stokes’s 
underhit drive to Steve Smith off Lyon, and later as they slid from 
173-5 to 179 all out, possibly the worst of them all, featuring Stuart 
Broad.

Golden? Ian Bell was caught by Johnson after misjudging a Nathan Lyon delivery first ball

Pietersen was on 45 and in a groove, and another hour or so of
him and England may well have racked up a lead of 300-plus which would 
have made them favourites for a victory that would mean so much.

All 
Broad needed to do, especially after Tim Bresnan had just chopped one 
on, was not get out, so quite what he was doing teeing off and slicing 
his third ball, from Lyon straight to Michael Clarke at slip, must 
remain a mystery.

Two-man’s land? That is where you end up when you 
don’t know when the time is right to try to grind out runs or to attempt
to impose yourself on the bowlers, or maybe when you have lost the 
ability to distinguish between the two.Not knowing whether to stick or twist and ending up doing neither.

Lyon
deserved his moment in front of another huge crowd of 70,000-plus but 
even he must have been somewhat embarrassed by the fact that none of the
balls with which he took 5-50, and his 100th Test wicket in the 
process, actually turned. No wonder Graeme Swann called it quits. It was
left to Pietersen to try to make sense of it all and, to be fair to 
him, he made a pretty brave fist of it, suggesting the demands of 
back-to-back Ashes series had left England jaded and ‘a bit fragile’, 
not to mention the possibility that the schedule may have contributed to
the early return home of Jonathan Trott and the permanent departure of 
Swann.

‘I think people shouldn’t forget, and it’s never been done 
before that guys have got to go and endure 10 back-to-back Ashes 
matches.

‘It has been an incredibly pressurised situation, being away
for the second leg and not starting in the manner that we are 
accustomed to … it’s been incredibly difficult.

‘I’ve been told that a
number of Olympic athletes go into some sort of post-Olympic depression
or a negative frame of mind, and I’m not saying we’re in a depression 
or a negative frame of mind, but after you’ve competed at such a level, 
post that competition, mentally you are a bit fragile.’

That is one explanation. Another is that England have played a lot of pants.
