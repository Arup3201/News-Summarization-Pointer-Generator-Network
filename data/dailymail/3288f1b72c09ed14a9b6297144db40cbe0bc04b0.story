A woman who put a voodoo curse on her former boyfriend before battering him to death and dumping his body in a lake was jailed for a minimum of 52 years today.

Joanne Griffiths, 41, along with her new lover Peter Hood, 43, killed the father of her child, Jason Bissell, 39, after luring him to Stretton Under Fosse, near Rugby, Warwickshire, with the promise of seeing his daughter.

But after a brief visit, as Griffith carried the baby back to her car, Hood crept up 
behind Mr Bissell and struck him ten times with a hammer.

After the brutal attack the couple bound Mr Bissell's head and face with duct tape before dumping him in a fishing lagoon.

Today Griffiths, 41, was ordered to serve 
at least 28 years for murder while Hood, 43, was also jailed for life 
and ordered to serve 24 years - reduced from 30 after he gave evidence 
against Griffiths.

During a six-week trial at Birmingham
Crown Court, the jury heard Griffiths had a six-month-old daughter with
Mr Bissell after a brief affair.

It was after Mr Bissell demanded to see his daughter Griffiths, who had reconciled with boyfriend Hood, hatched a plot to scare her former lover.

The couple launched a bizarre hate campaign against Mr Bissell in the months before his death, putting a witch's spell on him which Hood bought off eBay.

Griffiths also signed up to a website called getrevengeonyourex.com which sent Mr Bissell threatening texts messages and faxes.

The site also offered to put him under a so-called 'voodoo curse'.

When their hate campaign failed to deter Mr Bissell, Griffiths and Hood decided to murder him at the remote fishing lake.

On the evening of October 17 last year, Griffiths invited Mr Bissell to Lanny's Lagoon at Stretton-under-Fosse.

The court heard Griffiths, a hospital
secretary from Binley, Coventry, had been in a relationship with 
reporting analyst Hood for 15 months before breaking up with him in 
2009.

She had a brief fling with Mr Bissell
and fell pregnant but got back with Hood, from Nuneaton, months later 
and they planned to bring the baby up as their own

In an email sent from Griffiths to Hood months before the murder, she told
him: 'You will never know how many times I wished it [the father of her child] was you.

'I would have been happy. Between you and me, I wish I'd never told him [I was pregnant.].'

Sentencing them, Mr Justice Globe QC 
told them: 'There was a wicked motivation involved in the execution of 
the crime. The murder was done for gain.'

After last month's verdict Mr Bissell's family paid tribute to their 'bright and loving dad, son, brother and friend.'

They said: 'Jason was a bright and loving dad, son, brother and friend. His life was taken in an unbelievable way for trying to do what he knew was right.

'The actions of these people have ruined the lives of so many others and they will have that on their conscience forever.'
