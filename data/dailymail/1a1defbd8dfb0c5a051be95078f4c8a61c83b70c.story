The origins of Little Red Riding Hood have been traced back 2,000 years by scientists.

And they believe finding the roots of other folk tales could show how humans migrated throughout history.

Using techniques pioneered by evolutionary biologists, the new study reveals the folk tale first appeared in a spoken version called The Wolf and the Kids, which is still told in some countries.

Today the two stories are distinct, although their shared root has evolved into a number of different stories told in Africa and Asia since the original yarn first appeared in Europe in the first century AD.

Experts at Durham University used mathematical modelling to plot the 'evolutionary tree' of The Wolf and the Kids - a tale about a wolf that impersonates a nanny goat and eats her young.

They found the British favourite Little Red Riding Hood, whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception, branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree.

It evolved as a spoken story in France, Austria and northern Italy before being written down by French author Charles Perrault in the 1600s and was later re-told in its most familiar form by the Brothers Grimm, 200 years ago.

While The Wolf and the Kids - which is popular in Europe and the Middle East -  was evolving from spoken word to the printed tale of Little Red Riding Hood in Europe, it travelled south to Africa and eastwards to Asia to become The Tiger Grandmother in Japan, China and Korea.

Because the tale spent much of its early existence as a spoken story, it was difficult to trace back through time, as there are no written versions that could give researchers a reference point of date and place.

Durham anthropologist Dr Jamshid Tehrani, used a technique called phylogenetics - a mathematical modelling system - to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 variations of the folk tale collected from around the world.

The method is used by biologists for grouping closely-related organisms to map their evolution, but it helped him build a 'tree' that revealed the most likely branches, or paths, that the various versions took through time and revealed a surprising coincidence.

Dr Tehrani explained: 'This is rather like a biologist showing that humans and other apes share a common ancestor but have evolved into distinct species.

'My research cracks a long-standing mystery. The African tales turn out to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids but over time, they have evolved to become like Little Red Riding Hood, which is also likely to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids.

'This exemplifies a process biologists call convergent evolution, in which species independently evolve similar adaptations.

'The fact that Little Red Riding Hood ‘evolved twice’ from the same starting point suggests it holds a powerful appeal that attracts our imaginations.'

His findings, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS ONE, also overturned the theory believed by some that a forerunner to Little Red Riding Hood originally came from the Far East.

'It is claimed the tale spread west, along the Silk Route, and gave rise to both The Wolf and the Kids and the modern version of Little Red Riding Hood, Dr Tehrani said.

'My analysis demonstrates that in fact the Chinese version is derived from European oral traditions, and not vice versa.

'Specifically, the Chinese blended together Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf and the Kids and local folktales to create a new, hybrid story.

'This implies that the Chinese version is not derived from literary versions of Little Red Riding Hood but from the older, oral version, with which it shares crucial similarities,' he said.

Dr Tehrani added that applying the technique to other folk tales could reveal how humans migrated throughout history, by tracing the folk stories’ origin in time and geographically.

The tale of The Wolf and The Kids morphed into a German fable by the Brothers Grimm and is about a mother goat who leaves her kids at home but warns them not to open the door to a wolf who might impersonate her high voice.

She says they can also recognise her by her white feet, but the wolf covers himself in flour so he has white feet and mimics her voice, enters the house and eats all except the smallest of the kids.

The mother finds the wolf and cuts him open with a pair of scissors and her young spring out unharmed.

She fills the wolf's stomach with rocks before sewing him up and the wolf is so thirsty, he goes to drink in a stream and drowns, while the family of goats live happily ever after.

The tale of The Grandmother Tiger features a similar warning about strangers.

A mother leaves her two children at home in a quiet village while she goes out on a long journey to get food and tells the children not to let strangers inside while she is away over night.

But in the village there lives a bad tiger with a penchant for eating children. The big cat dresses up as a grandmother and in the middle of the night, eats the younger child.

Realising the grandmother is really the tiger, the older, wiser child runs outside to wait for the mother to return.
