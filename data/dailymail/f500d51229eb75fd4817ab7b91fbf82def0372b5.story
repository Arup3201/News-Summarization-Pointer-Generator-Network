A Utah couple and their three children who were discovered dead in their home last month were likely poisoned, it has emerged. 

The bodies of Benjamin Strack, 37, his wife Kristi, 36, and their children Benson, 14, Zion, 11, and 12-year-old Emery, were found in the locked master bedroom of their Springville home by their older son  in September - and much mystery has since surrounded the cause of their deaths.

Police are still not revealing exactly what they believed happened on September 27 - or who could be responsible for the deaths - but it has emerged that cups were found next to each of the bodies, while empty bottles of methadone and nighttime cold medicine were found dumped in a trash can.

Kristi Strack was also found with an unidentified red liquid coming out of her mouth.

'It is probable that these deaths were not accidental or natural in any way,' Detective Jeff Ellsworth wrote in the search warrant affidavit, which was obtained on Wednesday.

Toxicology results have not determined an exact cause of death, but search warrants obtained Wednesday showed that it was likely that the family had been poisoned.

Kristi Strack's mother, Valerie Sudweeks, said she couldn't believe her daughter would do this to the kids but wouldn't elaborate, police wrote. 

Police aren't saying who killed the family or whether one of the parents might have been involved.

According to the search warrants, Benjamin and Kristi Strack were in bed, with children ages 11 through 14 lying around them, tucked in bedding up to their necks.

'Furthermore, with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased,' detective Jeffery Ellsworth wrote. 

Investigators found several empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in their garbage, along with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. 

They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills, inside the home.

One pair of slippers with a spot of blood and a towel with a red substance on it were also removed.

Springville police Lieutenant Dave Caron said he couldn't comment on the search warrant or speculate about the cause of death until results of a toxicology test come back in November. 

'Until I get those, I really don't have anything,' he said. 'I could come up with all sorts of theories, but it's not helpful.'

The search warrant says it wasn't normal for the children to be in their parents' room because they had their own rooms.

Kristi Strack was last seen alive at 6am by the older son's girlfriend, who also lives in the home. 

The girlfriend went back to sleep after talking with Kristi Strack, and the house was quiet when the older son, 18-year-old Janson, and his girlfriend left the house that afternoon.

However, when they returned at 7pm and saw the house was still quiet even though all the cars were in the driveway, they knocked on the master bedroom door. 

When no one answered, the couple called Kristi Strack's mother and her friend, who helped them to force it open.

Police had previously said that they showed no signs of dying violently and it had been suggested that maybe they died by carbon monoxide poisoning, although no trace of the gas was found.

'Valerie [Kristi Strack's mother]... said she couldn't believe "she" would do this to the kids,' one of the affidavits states. 'Officers tried to clarify Valerie's statement, but she only assured them it wasn't a carbon monoxide leak.'

Little is known about the family.

Benjamin Strack's former boss said he worked off-and-on for six to seven years at AK Masonry, a bricklaying company, and had borrowed money in the past.  

Court records show Benjamin and Kristi Strack pleaded guilty to misdemeanor forgery charges in 2008 and disorderly conduct the following year. 

Bob McGee, uncle to the Strack children including the surviving son Janson, 18, said: 'We are shocked and heartbroken by the sudden loss of so many members of our family,'Deseret reported.

'Events like this are difficult to understand, and even harder to come to terms with. And no words can adequately describe our feelings of grief and sorrow.' 

The Strack's community started a GoFundMe page  to help surviving family with 'overwhelming' funeral costs.

The page devotes a few lines in remembrance of each family member, like father Benjamin. 'His heart was too big for this world and the love everyone felt when near him will not be forgotten,' it reads.

Not so long ago: Investigators have yet to lay down publicly a definite timeline of the family's deaths. Photos from their past show a family that appeared to be nothing but happy to have each other

The mom Kristi, the writer says, was 'charismatic, kind and loyal.' Her only daughter, Emery, loved animals.

Fourteen-year-old Benson loved to draw dragons and practice karate. His younger brother Zion, the youngest, 'brought everyone he came across happiness and joy.'

Heart-wrenching photos emerged of the handsome family, and the Stracks are exactly how surviving family members remember them--always smiling.

Preliminary autopsy results ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play.

'The Medical Examiner has indicated that the next step is to continue the investigation through analysis of blood samples to determine what may have caused the deaths,' the Springville DPS said in a statement.

'Preliminary autopsy results for the family of five who were found dead in their home have ruled out any sort of violent assault,' Springville police said in a statement.

Previously, a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, but investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death.

The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. 

The family's pets were all fine.

Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything.

'I do know when I was in there (the house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. 

A Facebook tribute page has also been set up to remember the family.

One user wrote: 'I feel a part of me has been lost. My brother Ben was my best friend.

'We did everything together. He always made me happy when he was around. Emery, Benson and Zion it seems like yesterday I was helping them with home work and taking them camping. I remember Benson caught his first fish with us on the trip.'

Another user wrote: ' Ben is one of my best friends. He was always like a brother to me as we grew up. I will miss him so much. His kids had the biggest smiles every time I seen them.'

On the tribute page another user wrote: 'I sat in a couple parent teacher conferences with both Ben and Kristi. 

They were always so thrilled to talk with me about Zion, they were truly proud parents. 

'I had the privilege to have their sweet, smiling, energetic, big brown eyed Zion in my second grade classroom. The happiness and energy he brought to school with him every day was infectious.'
