Blackpool have sacked manager Jose Riga.

Riga held talks with chairman Karl Oyston this morning where it was agreed it was time to end the manager’s four-and-a-half month spell in charge at Bloomfield Road.

The Belgian’s time at the club has been blighted by constant rows with his chairman and their relationship reached a point of no return over the weekend. 

Blackpool are expected to part company with beleaguered manager Jose Riga this week

Ex-Birmingham City manager Lee Clark is being sounded out as Riga's replacement at Bloomfield Road 

Riga lost eleven of his 16 games in charge after starting the season with just 13 players on the opening day. 

A statement on the club's website read: 'Blackpool Football Club can confirm that Head Coach Jose Riga has had his contract terminated with immediate effect.'

Former Birmingham manager Lee Clark  has emerged as the early candidate.

Sportsmail understands Clark - sacked by Birmingham City just last week -  could be appointed as soon as Wednesday.

Clark is used to working under a strict budget given the financial constraints put on him at St Andrew's and remains highly thought of within the game despite a turbulent time in the Midlands.
