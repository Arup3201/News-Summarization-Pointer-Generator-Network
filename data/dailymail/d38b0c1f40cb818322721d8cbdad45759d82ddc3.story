In a one-time conservative 'red' state whose map now looks pock-marked with 'blue' enclaves, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and long-time Clinton confidante, won a close governor's election Tuesday that is expected to set the tone for broader political battles in 2014 and 2016.

McAuliffe, the fundraising envelope-pusher who cooked up the idea to sell access to the Lincoln Bedroom under President Bill Clinton, is now positioned to navigate Virginia into the Democratic Party's column when Hillary Clinton runs for the top job in 2016.

The governor-elect had held solid double-digit polling leads over Ken Cuccinelli, the state's tea party-backed Republican attorney general. But ultimately fewer than 55,000 votes – out of more than 2.2 million cast – separated the two hard-charging men.

It was a massive shift from 2009, when McAuliffe crashed and burned in a Democratic primary because he was seen as a carpetbagger with no Virginia ties.

Terry McAuliffe claimed the governor's mansion in Virginia, putting the Democrats in position to turn an already purplish state blue in 2016

Like old times: Former President Bill Clinton campaigned for McAuliffe in Harrisonburg, Va., on Oct. 29, and showed up at other rallies to support the fundraiser who kept him in teh White House for eight years

President Obama stumped with McAuliffe on November 3 in Arlington, Virginia, a close-in suburb of Washington, D.C.

McAuliffe (R) is a veteran Democratic Party money man who came up with innovative ways for Bill Clinton to raise campaign cash -- including awarding a night in the White House's Lincoln Bedroom to top donors

A third-party candidate, Libertarian Robert Sarvis, collected more than 146,000 votes on Tuesday, enough to swing the election if his support came, as it likely did, mostly from otherwise Republican-leaning Virginians.

His campaign's largest source of funding, the Libertarian Booster PAC, is kept afloat mainly by Texas software tycoon Joe Liemandt, who Federal Election Commission records show 'bundled' between $100,000 and $200,000 in contributions toward President Obama's 2012 re-election.

Liemandt was among three dozen such bundlers who scored invitations to the State Dinner on Mar 14, 2012, honoring British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Sarvis' Obama connection made some conservative strategists carp on Tuesday night that he was a tool of Democrats eager to split off enough Republicans to deliver McAuliffe a victory.

'We've seen this kind of spoiler effect before. Remember Ralph Nader in 2000?' a GOP adviser told MailOnline during a phone call from the state capitol of Richmond.

'The whole Bush v. Gore thing came down to 537 votes in Florida, and Nader got more than 97,000 votes there. If he doesn't run in 2000, Al Gore is president for at least four years.' 

Ken Cuccinelli conceded the race along with his wife Teiro and their family after returns showed he would fall less than 2.5 percentage points short

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli came up short after a bruising campaign that pitted tea party Republicans against the star power of both the Obamas and the Clintons

Thomas Paine re-enactor John Wallmeyer, a member of four different tea party organizations, waited with other Republicans on Tuesday night, only to learn that Cuccinelli would lose by a relative handful of votes

Cuccinelli was
 the first state-level attorney general to initiate legal action against
 the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act. He sought to 
leverage voter dissatisfaction with the failed rollout, tying McAuliffe 
to it at every opportunity.

McAuliffe countered with a more devastating and costly avalanche of advertising that cast the Republican as an anti-female tea party stooge who would stand in the way of funding the kind of massive transportation projects that D.C. commuters have demanded.

Cuccinelli opposed it because it requires a tax increase.

Other ads hammered Cuccinelli for supporting 'personhood' legislation through an anti-abortion  movement that has raised the ire, and opened the pocketbook, of Planned Parenthood.

'I think every single person in Virginia is glad that the TV ads are now over,' he quipped during his victory speech.'

Both candidates brought star power across the Potomac River to stump with them. Cuccinelli relied on tea party superstars like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. McAuliffe had the Clintons and the Obamas.

Ultimately, the president and McAuliffe tied Cuccinelli to other Republicans who have caught most of the blame for October's federal government shutdown.

Blue Virginia: McAuliffe (R) cracked a joke at Clinton (C) and won approval from U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, himself a former Virginia governor

Out of tea? Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) stumped for Cuccinelli and read Bible verses at the October Family Foundation of Virginia Gala, but complaints about the Obama administration's 'hostility to religious liberty' weren't enough

Pockets of blue: Cuccinelli won far more Virginia counties than McAuliffe, for the Democrat swept the most populous urban and suburban areas including Richmond and the Northern counties adjacent to Washington, D.C.

Spoiler: Robert Sarvis, the libertarian candidate for Virginia Governor, collected more than enough right-leaning votes to split the GOP. His main financier was a top Obama contribution bundler

Dumbfounded: Republican partisans thought Cuccinelli had pulled off the upset of the year, with Obamacare driving down Democrats' poll numbers and the sting of the partial government shutdown in the rear-view mirror

Northern Virginia's populous exurb 
counties, blue Democratic oases in a sea of red, are packed with federal
 government workers who bore the 
brunt of temporary furloughs and other job insecurities in what is 
otherwise the most recession-proof industry in the U.S.

Cuccinelli committed several unforced political errors, including a 2012 interview in which he was thought to compare illegal immigrants to the rats that plague sections of Washington, D.C.

A protester calling for comprehensive immigration reform was removed from the stage before Ken Cuccinelli gave his concession speech Tuesday night. The defeated GOP candidate had a huge voter deficit among Latinos

Talking during a radio interview about a pest-control law in the city that prevents the mass killing of rats, he said, 'It is worse than our immigration policy. You can't break up rat families ... and you can't even kill 'em.'

Republican Party spokesman Garren Shipley later told The Washington Post that Cuccinelli 'was talking about how disturbing it was that our laws treat rats better than people, because our laws let us break up immigrant families.'

But Latino voters turned out in droves to support McAuliffe on Tuesday, with many convinced that his Republican opponent was anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic.

Both men had financial scandals to dodge. McAuliffe was tied to an electric car company, GreenTech, that ran afoul of federal investigators. Worse for his Virginia image, the company had set up its production line in Mississippi.

And Cuccinelli was haplessly tied to the financial scandals the engulfed the current Republican governor, Bob McDonnell.

A McDonnell funder who bought access with gifts to him and his wife – including at least one Rolex watch – also gave Cuccinelli and his family the run of his lake home for complimentary vacations.

McAuliffe, like all Virginia governors, will be a short-term winner: The state limits its top political executives to a single term in office.
