It's taken nearly a year but the Abbott government has finally delivered on its promise to axe the carbon tax.

After days of debate and stalling tactics, the Senate on Thursday voted 39 to 32 to unwind the carbon pricing scheme introduced by Labor in 2012.

But it wasn't the clean finish the government had wanted.

The prime minister has delivered on his key election promise to abolish the carbon tax following a fight he has pursued like a zealot since seizing the Liberal leadership from Malcolm Turnbull in December 2009Â 

It had to adopt as it own, amendments proposed and changed three times by the Palmer United Party after the Senate last week voted down the repeal bills a second time.

This time, as promised by Clive Palmer, his three senators and PUP ally Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party's Ricky Muir gave the government four of the six votes it required to pass the repeal package.

Family First's Bob Day and Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm - also on the crossbench - rounded out the majority needed.

Independent senator Nick Xenophon and DLP senator John Madigan also backed the repeal.

Labor and the Australian Greens opposed the legislation as expected but fell far short of the numbers needed to defeat it as they did in March.

PUP moved the only successful amendment to ensure savings to energy companies from the repeal were passed on to consumers and businesses.

That was a key demand by Mr Palmer in return for committing his crucial Senate team to backing the repeal.

Another proviso for his support was that a future emissions trading scheme be established in case Australia's trading partners act the same way, but that will be dealt with in other legislation.

Things didn't always go smoothly for the government as it pushed for an early repeal.

It was forced to re-introduce its repeal bills to the lower house on Monday following days of intense negotiations with PUP in the wake of the embarrassing defeat in the Senate.

When the bills returned to the Senate, Labor and the Greens dragged out the debate until a vote was taken at 11.14am on Thursday.

Greens leader Christine Milne made a last-minute plea to the crossbench telling them it was a 'critical moment' for the nation.

A vote to repeal was a vote for failure to address global warming, she warned.

'Australia will be relegated to a pariah and a backwater.'

Labor's Lisa Singh said Australia risked becoming the "laughing stock of the world".
