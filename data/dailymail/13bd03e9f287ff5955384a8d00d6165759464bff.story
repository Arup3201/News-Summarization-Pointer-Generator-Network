Celebrated children's author Lewis Carroll has been branded a 'repressed paedophile' in a new BBC documentary which uncovered naked photographs of the real-life sister of Alice in Wonderland taken by the writer. 

Carroll, who died in January 1898, befriended Alice Liddell and her two sisters as they were children. It was Miss Liddell who was the inspiration for the famous book.

However, researchers working on a documentary on the 150th anniversary of the publication of the much-loved children's book discovered some disturbing images.

New photographs discovered in advance of the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice in Wonderland has led to claims that author Lewis Carroll, pictured, may have been 'a Victorian Jimmy Savile'

According to the show's presenter Martha Kearney, some of the pictures of Alice's elder sister Lorina, which featured her naked in a full-frontal pose, are images that 'no parent would ever have consented to'. 

Carroll, whose real name was Charles Dodgson, knew the girls' father Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church, Oxford. 

The BBC programme investigates whether Carroll could be considered as a 'Victorian Jimmy Savile'. 

Carroll was a keen photographer who took many photographs of Alice and her sisters.

English professor Hugh Haughton told the programme: 'It will certainly make it harder for those who believe that Carroll's interest in little girls was totally innocent; it will make it more complicated.'

Author Will Self said: ' Dodgson [Carroll] himself, I think, was a heavily repressed paedophile, without a doubt.' 

Alice's great-grand daughter Vanessa Tait told the programme: 'He was a strange man but an admirable one, and I don't want to tar him with accusations of paedophilia which we're all so obsessed with now.' 

The Secret World of Lewis Carroll will be broadcast on Saturday January 31, at 9pm
