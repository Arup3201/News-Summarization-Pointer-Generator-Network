Coal mines in the North East may have closed many years ago, but coal is still making a living for a few hardy men.

Tony Reed is one such 'sea-coaler' - someone who makes their living by collecting and selling coal washed up on the beaches of Hartlepool in County Durham.

The 51-year-old has to plan his work around the moon, because every low tide the waves at Seaton Carew beach in Hartlepool bring ashore tons of coal washed up from seams in the bed of the North Sea.

Fuel: Mr Reed and the 18 other sea-coalers harvest thousands of tonnes of coal a year, which is burned for energy

Twice a day at the low tide Mr Reed rakes the washed-up black coal deposits into small piles and them shovels them into his specially-adapted Land Rover pickup.

It is backbreaking physical labour. The sodden coal particles are heavy and must be scraped up using only a rake and shovel.

It is not known where the seams lie exactly, but the seabed is constantly eroded by the currents and every tide lifts its load and drags it to shore.

Collection: This back-breaking labour allows Mr hall and his colleagues to collect around a tonne of coal each every day

Transport: Mr Hall uses an adapted Land Rover to transport the coal, but bollards erected by the local council mean he can no longer get it on the beach

Stoic: The work is incredibly arduous and the men must move quickly to harvest the coal

Dispute: Some say the sea-coalers provide a valuable service, others claim they damage they are bad for the beach

A seasoned sea-coaler, Tony has been scouring the sands for 30 years on and off, and on an average day he can get up to a tonne, which sells for about Â£10.

He is one of a small group of men in Hartlepool who scrape a living from the back-breaking work, which sees them heading for the shore at any given hour.

On average, 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year will be collected from the beaches around Hartlepool, before being transported to power stations.

Heft: The seawater makes the coal particles very heavy, and the only way to lift the dust onto the Land Rover is by hand

The coal is washed up from seams on the ocean floor. The amount varies day to day

Dispute: Hartlepool Council says sea-coaling must stop as the beach is for pedestrians only

But with much of the UK's coal-fired power stations facing imminent retirement under the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, making a living from sea-coaling may soon become a footnote in the history of the British coal industry.

The industry is not without its detractors. Many residents claim it is dangerous and causes damage to the beaches, but some claim the sea-coalers provide a vital public service by keeping the beaches clean.

In 2001 there were an estimated 20 sea-coalers operating in Hartlepool.

In the seventh century, the monks of the nearby village of Blackhall Rocks burned the coal for warmth

Ancient: The coal was first gathered by monks in the 7th Century

Uncertainty: Coal-fired plants are under threat, throwing doubt onto the future of sea-coaling's future

Veteran: Mr Reed has been sea-coaling on and off since he was 21, more than 30 years

Fuel: The coal is transported to power stations

Hard: The coal is swept into a series of small piles and then hauled onto the pick-up Land Rovers

Scraping together: An average load on the Land Rovers is two tonnes
