'Killer': Stephen Rozniakowski allegedly shot dead his ex-girlfriend and wounded her daughter Monday

A police officer broke into an ex-girlfriend's house and shot her dead before wounding her 15-year-old daughter - just hours after the woman was granted an order of protection against him.

Stephen Rozniakowski, an officer with the Colwyn Borough Police Department in Pennsylvania, allegedly gunned down Valerie Morrow, who broke up with him in August, at her home in Glenolden on Monday night.

Just hours before she was killed, Morrow told anNBC10 reporter that Rozniakowski, 32, had been sending her threatening messages, and said: 'If you find me dead, he did it.' 

After Rozniakowski broke into the house and gunned down the 40-year-old mother-of-two, he allegedly shot her teenage daughter, Bridgette Cruz, in the bicep before she fled to her room.

Morrow's husband, Tom, himself a cop for Morton Borough, was also inside the house at the time and awoke to hear gunshots. He grabbed his gun from the nightstand and shot at the intruder.

He shot Rozniakowski, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, multiple times but did not kill him, the DA told the Philadelphia News.

When Mr Morrow heard the gunman re-loading his weapon, he jumped out of a second-story window, breaking his ankle. Despite the pain, he ran to a neighbor's house to call 911.

Back in the house, Cruz left her bedroom and saw Rozniakowski in the hallway with his gun to his head - but she hit it out of his hand and then escaped from the house, authorities said.

As Morrow called 911, Rozniakowski reported himself over the Delaware County police radio.

'I'm unarmed,' he told the dispatcher, who asked to know who the suspect - or 'actor'- was.

'I am the actor,' Rozniakowski responded.

Mrs Morrow, who was also an officer, was pronounced dead when authorities arrived on the scene, and Bridgette and her stepfather were taken to hospital for treatment.

Rozniakowski is in critical but stable condition at Crozer-Chester Medical Center.

Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan told the Philly News that Mr Morrow's quick-thinking may have stopped Rozniakowski from killing all three.

'He went there to execute the entire family, in my opinion,'  Whelan told NBC10. 'I have no doubt.'

Rozniakowski has been charged with first-degree murder and related offenses.

'We are looking at this as a potential death-penalty case,' Whelan said.

NBC reported that just hours before her death, Morrow had reached out to reporter Harry Hairston - who had previously reported on Rozniakowski - and told him she dated the police officer for months before ending the relationship in August to reunite with her husband.

But afterwards, he bombarded her with calls and texts, sometimes with threatening messages.

On Monday, she obtained an order of protection. The Morrows also believed that Rozniakowski had scratched their new jeep last week.

'She feared for her life. She feared for her family's life,' a friend told WPVI.  

The order was delivered to the house Rozniakowski shared with his mother and brother around 6pm on Monday.

After the order was granted, his service weapon was removed and he was put on administrative leave. He used a private weapon in the killing, police said.

On Monday evening, he resigned his position with the Colwyn Police Department.

Rozniakowski's attorney, Marty Mullaney, said he had spoken to both his client and Morrow before the shooting on Monday in an attempt to diffuse the situation.

'He said he just wanted to chat with her,' Mullaney said. 

In a separate case, his former fiancee accused him of texting her and calling her - sometimes more than 100 times a day - and had also taken out an order of protection against him.

He was charged with 25 counts of stalking and 50 counts of harassment in that case and was due in the court on Thursday.

Court records show he was also found guilty of harassment in 2009 and 2010.

Despite the convictions and his recent arrest, Rozniakowski stayed with the Colwyn department. His weapon was also removed following the charges earlier this year. 

Colwyn Police Chief Bryan Hills had told the Delaware County Daily Times in April that he thought many of the allegations were 'bulls***'.
