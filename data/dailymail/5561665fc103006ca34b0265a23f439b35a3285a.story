As snowboarder Jenny Jones rode to Winter Olympic glory yesterday, she knew she was being watched by millions.

What she did not realise was that the crowd included two very important spectators – her parents.

The 33-year-old, who won bronze in the slopestyle with spectacular jumps, leaps and grinds, had always banned her mother and father from coming to her competitions because it made her too nervous.

But Peter and Helen Jones were not going to miss the chance to see their daughter win an Olympic medal – Britain’s first ever on snow – so they flew to Russia to surprise her.

'Hyperactive': The BBC has apologised after hundreds of viewers complained the broadcaster had spoiled Jenny Jones's Olympic bronze medal success and branded the commentators 'puerile and hyperactive'

Rad: Jones performs a stylish jump during her successful run. However, many viewers were less impressed with the BBC commentary

Error: During the commentary, the presenters incorrectly told the nation Jenny had won gold and un-sportingly whooped with delight when a competitor fell over

Miss Jones burst into tears when she saw them at the finish point moments after realising she had taken bronze.

After
 their emotional embrace  Mrs Jones, from Bristol, said: ‘It’s 
absolutely unbelievable, she has never  disappointed us. We have always 
been proud of her but, blimey, this is the icing on the cake.’

Mr Jones added: ‘I need a whisky – I think we both need a drink and a long sleep. It’s been great coming out here.’

As well as her parents’ support, Miss Jones had the help of an unusual lucky charm – a tea bag tucked into her bra.

The snowboarder, who was the oldest competitor by more than six years, said she felt ‘absolutely ecstatic’.

‘A
 few said, “Is she past it?” but … I did the best run I could have 
done … you sense the world is watching and you had to control that part 
of things and not let it get to you too much.

Apres-ski? British snowboarder Jenny Jones tweeted this, suggesting she might have gone out celebrating after her win. Viewers were repeatedly told viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were

Star in the making: Jones in 2002, a few years after winning her first of five British Snowboard Championships

‘I
 feel very proud to have won a bronze medal for my country. I can’t 
believe it’s our first on snow.’ She added: ‘It is still sinking in, the
 history part … I absolutely had no idea of this when I was a chalet 
maid cooking breakfast and cleaning toilets … it was just about 
snowboarding.’

It was while
 working on the ski slopes that Miss Jones developed her superstition. 
Missing British home comforts, she noticing some tea bags as she was 
cleaning a room.

‘I put one
 inside my bra so I could have a drink later,’ she revealed in an 
interview in 2012. ‘I forgot all about it and went out snowboarding and 
completed my first ever backflip.

‘It
 was amazing. It was only later that I remembered the tea bag but it had
 crumbled into a load of loose leaves. I couldn’t use them to make a 
cuppa so I gathered them up and kept them for a couple of years until 
they crumbled into nothing but they brought me more good luck.’

She has continued the ritual for competitions ever since.

At
 one stage yesterday the snowboarder held the lead after scoring 87.25 
points  in her second run and had an agonising  wait while ten athletes 
tried to better  her mark.

 Jamie Anderson eventually took gold with 95.25, ahead of Finland’s Enni
 Rukajarvi on 92.50. The three women shouted their delight and hugged as
 the final competitor failed to match their scores.

Miss
 Jones said: ‘It was so difficult waiting. I thought I did my best run 
and landed it as best as I could, thankfully it was enough. That was a 
long waiting game.’ 

Her triumph comes after a life  of hard work and 
dedication to  snowboarding. Before working  as a chalet girl, she paid 
her  way with jobs in a cardboard  factory and a doughnut shop.

The 
fearless sports star has also overcome horrendous injuries. Her most 
recent accident was in December when she suffered bad concussion after 
missing a jump and landing on her head, but she has also broken her 
tailbone, two bones in her left arm and her foot.

Pictures
 she posted online show her facial scars from training and she had to 
take nine months off after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament. The 
injury was four years after she began snowboarding with a 30-minute 
lesson on a dry slope with her brothers.
