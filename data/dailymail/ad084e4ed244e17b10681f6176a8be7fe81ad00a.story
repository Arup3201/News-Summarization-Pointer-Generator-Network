The final few days of April last year were the worst of Sam Bell-Minogue’s life. 

Her one-year-old daughter, Poppy, was seriously ill in hospital with a mystery condition that gave her seizures and made her scream out in pain.

‘She couldn’t sit up or lift her head,’ says Sam, 30.

Poppy was diagnosed with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) at the age of one after suffering seizures and screaming out in pain (pictured at around three weeks with mother Sam Bell-Minogue)

‘All of her muscle strength had gone and she couldn’t move her arms.’ 

Sam, an assistant sports director, had rushed Poppy to the Royal Derby Hospital after she suddenly took a turn for the worse following a week-long chest infection. 

Tests over a week at the hospital brought bad news.

Although doctors couldn’t identify the cause, an MRI scan showed that Poppy had brain damage. Other tests, including a heart ECG and blood tests, indicated her organs were starting to fail.

Sam and her husband Eugene, 34, a sports development manager, were warned that their daughter could die within a couple of months. 

‘Apart from some physiotherapy, the doctors said there were no potential treatments,’ says Sam, who lives with Eugene, their four-year-old son Charlie and Eugene’s daughter Molly, eight, as well as Poppy, in Ilkeston, Derbyshire.

‘We took her home and tried to come to terms with it. Losing a child — that’s the worst thing you can hear as a parent.’

Eugene adds: ‘We were talking about things like funerals. It was devastating.’

But a phone call a few weeks later brought some hope. 

Poppy had tested positive for Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) — a rare genetic condition that affects approximately one in 100,000 babies. 

It is so-called because it can cause urine to have a syrupy smell.

She’d had the blood test for MSUD after a doctor at the Royal Derby was advised to test her by a neurologist, who recognised that trouble sitting up was a symptom of the disorder.

Another MRI scan and genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis. 

It meant doctors could now treat Poppy. 

‘She was still very poorly, but there was a chance of keeping her, so this diagnosis brought some relief,’ says Sam.

MSUD causes problems digesting certain amino acids — the building blocks of protein. 

These can build up to a toxic level, severely affecting the baby’s brain and muscle function.

This can lead to problems sitting up and moving limbs, as the build-up interferes with signals from the brain to muscles in the arms and legs. 

The digestive system can also be affected, leading to poor feeding and vomiting.

Untreated, the build-up can lead to coma and permanent brain damage. 

But if MSUD is diagnosed early, babies can be treated with a low-protein diet and go on to live a normal life.

Starting this week, MSUD is being added to the NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening Programme, along with three other conditions, in England and Wales. 

'If it wasn’t for the neurologist thinking of MSUD, things could have been very different,' said Sam

Currently, all babies are given a heel-prick blood test at five days old to check for five conditions, including the blood disorder sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.

Spotting the ‘new’ conditions earlier could mean the difference between a healthy, active life and an early death. 

In addition to MSUD, these conditions are homocystinuria, glutaric aciduria type 1 and isovaleric acidaemia. 

All are caused by an inability to process amino acids and can kill if not treated. If the baby survives, it can be left severely disabled or brain-damaged.

But detected early, they can be managed with similar low-protein diets to the one for MSUD (avoiding proteins such as meat, fish and eggs and taking synthetic proteins to replace the amino acids sufferers can’t digest).

Although rare (each affects around 25 babies each year) screening for the conditions will save or vastly improve many lives. 

The changes come after a successful pilot run by the National Institute for Health Research and Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation.

Professor Jim Bonham, director of newborn screening at Sheffield, who headed the programme, says it could ‘radically improve the quality of life of children who are detected. 

For some, it could mean the difference between being in a wheelchair and playing football with their friends’. 

In the pilot, 437,000 babies in five cities were tested between July 2012 and July 2013.

It identified 40 babies at risk — 12 were diagnosed with one of the four ‘new’ conditions and were then treated.

While the new blood tests have been welcomed, countries such as Australia and New Zealand already screen babies for 28 conditions — rather than nine, as is now the case here.

Campaigners believe we should follow suit and extend our test to even more conditions, such as Krabbe’s disease, a genetic disorder that can cause brain damage, which affects more than 100,000 people worldwide.

‘There are other disorders children are being severely disabled by, or dying from, which could be screened for with the heel-prick test,’ says Pat Roberts, executive director of the Save Babies Through Screening Foundation UK, which has organised an online petition calling for the test to be extended.

All NHS screening programmes must be assessed and passed by the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC).

Dr Anne Mackie, its director of programmes, says: ‘We have taken a very rigorous view of wanting to know, condition by condition, that we do more good than harm at reasonable cost.’ 

She adds that any UK test must be accurate, as this minimises ‘false positives’, and there must be an effective treatment available.

UK NSC is considering ten conditions to add to the test, including Hurler syndrome, an enzyme deficiency that can cause organ damage, which affects around seven babies a year in the UK.

Sam Bell-Minogue welcomes the new tests, but says she is concerned health workers may not be prepared: ‘When I was last in hospital with Poppy in November, none of the doctors or nurses knew about MSUD — or that screening would start in January.’

Poppy’s diagnosis came just in time. After three months, she was back to good health. Now aged 19 months, she’s learning to walk and talk as normal. 

However, MRI scans show she has ‘small pockets’ of damage all over her brain. How this will affect her will not become clear until she is older, but a recent scan has shown signs of improvement to her nervous system.

‘It’s been a miraculous recovery,’ says Sam. ‘If it wasn’t for the neurologist thinking of MSUD, things could have been very different. 

'Without the test, we wouldn’t be here now.’
