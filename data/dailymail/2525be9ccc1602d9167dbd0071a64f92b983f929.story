Crystal Palace Under 21s were beaten 4-2 by Colchester earlier this week, but there was a moment of individual brilliance by Eagles midfielder Hiram Boateng.

The 19-year-old picks the ball up inside his own half and drives forward, powering his way through the Colchester midfield.

After opening his lengthy stride and bursting past three Colchester players Boateng shows great balance and strength as he drives towards the penalty area.

The defensively-minded midfielder is highly-rated at Palace and Boateng was one of three academy players to join the first team squad on the pre-season tour of America.

Boateng made his first team debut for Palace during a 4-1 defeat by Stoke in the FA Cup third round in January, 2013, but didn't make another appearance for a year, again in the FA Cup.
