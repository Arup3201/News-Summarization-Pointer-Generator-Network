ESPN has suspended one of its most popular columnist for three weeks after he called NFL commissioner Roger Goodell a liar in a profanity-laced rant then dared the sports network to discipline him. 

ESPN, which is a corporate partner of the National Football League and airs Monday Night Football each week, now faces intense criticism from millions of furious fans, who have made #freesimmons the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter.

In his weekly podcast, the BS Report, Simmons ranted that Goodell was lying when he claimed that he had not seen the video of Ray Rice punching his wife in the face before it was leaked to the public by TMZ earlier this month. 

'Goodell, if he didn't know what was on that tape, he's a liar. I'm just saying it. He is lying. I think that dude is lying,' Simmons said - becoming increasingly agitated as he spoke.

Suspended: Bill Simmons, one of the ESPN's most popular sports commentators, is off the air for three weeks after his rant against NFL commissioner Roger Goodell

'If you put him up on a lie detector test that guy would fail. For all these people to pretend they didn't know is such f****** bull s***. It really is, it's such f****** bull s***. And for him to go in that press conference and pretend otherwise, I was so insulted. I really was.'

The NFL initially suspended Rice, a Baltimore Ravens running back, just two games after was arrested for knocking his then-fiance unconscious and dragging her out of an elevator at a hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

When the video of the attack emerged two weeks ago, fan outrage over the light discipline grew to a fever pitch. Goodell and team officials claimed they had never seen the punching video and responded by kicking Rice off the Ravens and banning him from the league for life. 

As Simmons ranted, he turned his attention to his employer, saying: I really hope somebody calls me or emails me and says I’m in trouble for anything I say about Roger Goodell. Because if one person says that to me, I’m going public. 

'You leave me alone. The commissioner’s a liar, and I get to talk about that on my podcast. … Please, call me and say I’m in trouble. I dare you.'

ESPN apparently took the bait and suspended Simmons, who is the editor of the sports site Grantland and the co-creator of ESPN's 30for30 documentary series.

The sports network, which is owned by Disney, yanked the podcast from its website and issued a statement about Simmons: 

'Every employee must be accountable to ESPN and those engaged in our editorial operations must also operate within ESPN's journalistic standards. 

'We have worked hard to ensure that our recent NFL coverage has met that criteria. Bill Simmons did not meet those obligations in a recent podcast, and as a result we have suspended him for three weeks.'

Simmons' peers and fans have responded with jeers and calls for boycotting ESPN.

Wow, I guess someone actually CAN get swiftly and harshly punished for a recording that reflects poorly on the NFL,' Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik tweeted.

Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery demanded to know: 'What exact 'journalistic standard' did Bill Simmons - a personally branded columnist and analyst - violate? Speaking ill of the NFL?'

'Bill Simmons: Suspended by ESPN for saying what LITERALLY every person was already thinking and saying,' one Twitter commentator said.

Many pundits pointed out that Simmons' punishment was harsher than Rice's original suspension. 

And it was harsher than the one-week suspension for ESPN anchor Stephen A. Smith, who said women can be responsible for provoking men into domestic violence. 

'All you need to know about ESPN: Stephen A Smith says women need to stop provoking men = 1 week. Simmons says Goodell is lying = 3 weeks,' Fox Sports columnist Jimmy Traina said.
