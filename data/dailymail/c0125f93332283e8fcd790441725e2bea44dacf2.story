An English-language magazine published by Al Qaeda's media arm calls on Muslims around the world to use homemade car bombs on targets including Las Vegas casinos, New York's Times Square and UK department stores.

The online publication, entitled Palestine: Betrayal of the Guilty Conscience Al-Malahem, also includes a nine-page spread with instructions on how to 'make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.'

There is also a timeline of terror attacks, including 9/11 and the Boston bombings that includes a blank entry marked '201?' implying a terror attack on American soil is planned for the near future.

Terrorist's handbook: 'Palestine: Betrayal of the guilty conscience' is an English-language online publication that encourage extremists living in Western countries to carry out acts of terrorism

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) first flagged the publication.

'The timeline concludes with the date 201?’ and blank spaces and question marks for the photo and information of the next attack - implying that it is coming soon,' MEMRI Executive Director Steve Stalinsky told Fox News.

The guide to making a carbomb comes complete with step-by-step photographs, a shopping list, and admiring words about the Tsarnaev brothers, the 'Boston brothers.'

'My Muslim brother: we are conveying to you our military training right into your kitchen to relieve you of the difficulty of traveling to us,' it reads.

Haunting: The disturbing publication ends with the words, 'We are coming'

'If you are sincere in your intentions to serve the religion of Allāh, then all what you have to do is enter your kitchen and make an explosive device that would damage the enemy if you put your trust

in Allāh and then use this explosive device properly.'

At the end is a list of 'examples of targets,' including oil tankers and trains, casinos in Las Vegas, and the General Atomics headquarters in San Diego.

In Britain, the publications suggest novice jihadis target the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, a British department store during Friday prayers (so as to harm no Muslims) and Thames house, London.

In the rest of the world, Israeli, British and and American company headquarters and places where Israelis, Britons and Americans holiday.

The publication is an adjunct to Inspire magazine, which is aimed at encouraging Muslims in Western countries to carry out terror attacks.

'Inspire Magazine's goal is to empower Muslim. And what is empowerment without being strong, powerful and intelligent?

In this section, we give you strength, power and intelligence. Believe me, using car bombs gives you all that,' the publications reads.
