A crane flipped over and came crashing down while removing a tree near Tampa Bay, Florida, Sunday, damaging a home, smashing an RV and three parked vehicles.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the crane operator jumped to safety when the heavy machinery he was using to uproot a storm-damaged tree on Dream Way in Largo started to tip over just after 11.30am.

No significant injuries were reported. The crane did not damage the property of the Largo homeowner who needed the tree removed.

Smash-up: The boom of the crane came down on top of this parked car, which was unoccupied at the time

Path of destruction: Besides the RV, the toppled crane also damaged a house and three vehicles 

However, the crane fell on top of three nearby cars and a 2011 camper, and took down a light pole. Deputies say the fall also caused severe damage to a neighboring home.

It took work crews several hours to pull the battered crane from under the debris and upright it.

Eyewitness Chett Razey captured on his cellphone the heart-pounding moment the crane tipped over.

'Before I knew it, it took out a couple of vehicles and a trailer,' he told WFLA.

Near miss: The operator of the crane was able to jump out of the cabin just in time, suffering only minor scrapes 

One of the people who were affected by the incident was Largo resident Jeffrey Claus, whose house and van were damaged by the boom of the falling crane.

The rented crane was being operated by Danny Tomas, an employee of a St Petersburg-based company called Sustainable Tree care, who escaped the cabin with only a few minor scrapes.

Tomas was using the crane to remove a tree on the property of Melinda Jenkins, 50, at 9115 Dream Way, after it was damaged during a recent storm, which caused it to collapse onto the roof of her house. 

According to neighbor Sandra Beard, who suffered property damage as a result of the accident, the crane crash marked a very close call for her family.

Homeowner Melinda Jenkins hired a St Petersburg-based company to remove this tree from her yard after it was damaged during a recent storm 

Culprit: The Sunday crane accident took place during the removal of this battered tree 

Beard explained that her son and grandchildren were standing near the crane just before it plummeted to the ground.  

‘They were all playing out here watching them cut the tree,' she said. 'They had just asked by son to move the van and then the crane fell on it.’ 

The sheriff’s department have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the collapse.
