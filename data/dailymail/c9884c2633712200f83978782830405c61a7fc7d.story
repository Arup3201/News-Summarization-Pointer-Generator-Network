A five-year-old girl who lost all four limbs to meningitis two years ago is now standing tall after receiving a very special Christmas present.

Charlotte Nott nearly died after she was struck down by the most deadly form of the virus in December 2010. She can now walk in comfort for the first time after an anonymous donor paid for a pair of sparkly pink prosthetic legs

Her mother Jenny Daniels, 31, said her daughter was thrilled with her £6,000 gift.

'They are so comfortable that she can now walk properly for the first time since her operations,' Ms Daniels from Oxford told The Sun.

'There's no stopping her now. It's fantastic.'

Jenny and partner Alex Nott were preparing to leave for a pre-Christmas family holiday in Lanzarote when Charlotte developed Meningococcal Septicaemia.

Jenny noticed the tell-tale purple marks that identify the deadly infection on Charlotte's chest and called paramedics. Charlotte was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and within hours suffered multiple organ failure.

Doctors battled to stop the disease from spreading, but after five days her fingers and toes had turned black.

She had gangrene brought on by septicaemia and had to have all four of her limbs removed in January 2011.

Mrs Nott said:  ‘For about four days it looked as though Charlotte might not make it. I just sat by her bed in the hospital, stroking her hair, and telling her, “Mummy loves you, daddy loves you, George loves you” over and over again.

‘If she was going to die I wanted her to die knowing how loved she was and that we all adored her.’

Thankfully Charlotte pulled through 
and doctors managed to save her elbow and knee joints. Ever the 
determined young lady, she learnt to draw with her mouth and crawl to 
get around the house.

Charlotte learnt how to cope after meeting Ellie Challis, another little girl who had
 lost all four of her limbs to meningitis when she was only a toddler.

The girls met last year and spent a day out at Mead Open Farm, in Bedfordshire. Ellie, from Little Clacton, Essex, showed Charlotte her prosthetic limbs and modified wheelchair.

Charlotte
 was fitted with her own NHS prosthetics in June last year, but had 
struggled to walk in them. The new legs are top of the range and were 
created by Dorset Orhopaedic, who have also made limbs for campaigner 
Heather Mills.

Mrs 
Daniels, an administrator for a book publisher, said watching her brave 
daughter decorating the Christmas tree this year had brought tears to 
her eyes.

'We are going to have a wonderful Christmas,' she said.
