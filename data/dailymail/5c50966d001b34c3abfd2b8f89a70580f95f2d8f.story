The chilling moment a German lorry driver ploughed his 40-ton vehicle into the back of a queue of motorway traffic and killed a man has been released on CCTV.

Anton Maizen was jailed for four-and-a-half years this week after he caused the death of a 79-year-old man and injured two others. He had been driving solidly for 15 hours before the crash, which happened on the M25 near Aveley in Essex.

Footage of the violent crash shows Maizen, 58, hurtling towards the back of the sliproad queue at 56mph - the maximum speed his lorry would allow.

Moment from impact: Anton Maizen's 40-ton lorry approaches the queue of traffic on the sliproad of the M25 in Essex at full pelt

Smash: Unable to stop, he ploughs into the back of a BMW at 56mph, the lorry's maximum speed

Unfolding horror: The smashed BMW is propelled into the inside lane, causing a second lorry to lose control and swerve into the queue of traffic

Swerve: The second lorry comes off the road, while the German's vehicle jackknifes and ends up on the hard shoulder

He smashes into the back of one car, which causes a second lorry to swerve off the inside lane and into the queue, while Maizen's vehicle careers into a wall.

Jailed: Maizen was jailed for four-and-a-half years earlier this week

A mother and child escaped without serious injury but the driver of a Renault Clio, 79-year-old Ronald Moughton from Ilford, died at the scene.

Maizen, of Wixhausen, south of Frankfurt, admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Basildon Crown Court today.

The crash, on Tuesday, April 2, came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - driving for 15 of those hours without a break.

Maizen's 840-mile journey had begun the 
previous day in Germany, with the driver entering the UK via Folkestone.

He then drove to south London, before continuing on his way to 
Lincolnshire.

During this time he did not take breaks of longer than an hour - and did not have any sustained period of sleep, the court heard. Maizen was returning to the Channel Tunnel when the crash took
place.

During his police interviews, he was unable to explain why he struck the rear of the queue at his maximum speed of 56mph.

Maizen's
tachograph charts were found hidden behind the driver's seat and a data
chart in his sock was later found disclosing his route and timings.

Wreckage: A man died as a result of the pile up on the M25 in Essex

Dangerous: The crash came after Maizen had been at work for nearly 23 hours - with 15 of them spent on the road

The German motorist was disqualified 
from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended driving test
in order to regain his licence.

Tailbacks: The German was also disqualified from driving for five years following the collision

Judge Owen Davies QC said: 'It would 
appear that you failed to slow your vehicle and were still driving at 
50mph when you applied the brakes.

'Expert evidence shows it must have been fatigue that caused this incident.

'You had been driving for 22 hours and 44 minutes without the lengthy period of rest required.

'Your actions in those brief moments have caused untold misery on others.'

James
Harrison, mitigating, told the court his client deeply regretted his 
actions and took complete responsibility for the suffering he has 
caused.

He said: 'He knows that words are not
enough to express the regret he feels for those who suffered loss and 
injury as a result of his actions.

'Had he foreseen the likelihood of any incident like this unfolding he would never have climbed behind the wheel of his cab.'

Inspector Keith Whiting of Essex 
Police said: 'We believe drivers and owners of foreign and British 
commercial lorries will take note from this tragic incident that those 
who disregard the law and the safety of vulnerable people in smaller 
vehicles around them will be brought to justice, face a prison sentence 
and a lengthy disqualification.

'We
also believe that people who were disrupted for several hours as a 
result of this crash will appreciate that the complex and meticulous 
investigation undertaken by Essex Police's Serious Collision 
Investigation Unit was justified and has successfully brought a driver 
to justice for causing one death and serious injury of two other road 
users.'
