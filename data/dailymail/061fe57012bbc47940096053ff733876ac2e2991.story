As a 53-year-old facelift patient jumped to her death from the roof of an exclusive Beverly Hills clinic, a reality TV star tweeted her shock at the tragic event.

The unnamed woman, reported to have been a patient of surgeon to the stars Dr Brian Novack, was said to have been recovering from an operation when she became agitated and fled to the roof.

As emergency crews arrived to try to reach out to the woman, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump tweeted about the incident.

The reality TV star's Villa Blanca restaurant is close to Novack's sleek North Camden Drive clinic.

At 10.15am on Wednesday she tweeted in reply to two followers: 'Yes a woman has jumped to her death and you are right it is in front of Villa Blanca ...very sad.'

A short while later she tweeted: 'Outside VB the road is blocked ... Sadly a woman threatening to commit suicide for the last few hours has followed thru. Terrible scene.'

Staff at Novack's clinic confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the woman had been a patient at the clinic, where she had been given a facelift the day before.

An official comment has not been made by the surgery, and an unidentified man told the Hollywood Reporter: 'We are not giving out any information about the incident that happened at our building.'

The moment of the fatal fall on Wednesday was filmed on a cell phone by an unidentified person.

The distressing footage shows the roads around the 15-storey building cordoned off with police tape, as a gaggle of passers by stare up to try to figure out what is happening.

Shock: Vanderpump confirmed the tragic news of the leap to her Twitter followers

Along the edge of the building a figure suddenly jumps to her feet and heads to the farthest corner.

The patient's identity has not been released but The Hollywood Reporter has learned that she had been staying overnight under supervision at Novack's sleek clinic on North Camden Drive in Beverly Hills after a facelift.

According to the celebrity news site, 
the woman - described as blonde and Caucasian - became agitated, took 
off her hospital gown and fled from the 10th-floor clinic, running up to
 the roof five storeys up.

Police
 received a report at about 7am about a partially clothed woman standing
 on the roof of the Camden Medical Arts building located near Rodeo 
Drive and threatening to jump.

'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' star Lisa Vanderpump took to Twitter to say Mrs D'Auriol's death occurred just a few feet from her Villa Blanca restaurant. The reality television star called the tragedy 'very sad'

A crisis negotiation team was dispatched to the scene and tried to talk the woman down for about three hours, but to no avail.

‘She sat on the ledge naked, then got up and walked around the edge of the building as if on a tightrope,’ a witness, describing the harrowing scene, said. ‘She sat back down again before getting up and jumping off.’

The unnamed victim was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

The Beverly Hills Police Department and the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office are withholding the patient's name.

An employee who works for another doctor in the building told The Hollywood Reporter that she saw Novack in the lobby afterwards, and that he 'looked demolished.'

Novack, a graduate of McGill University, is highly regarded among Hollywood's leading ladies - and probably some gentlemen - as much for his impressive scalpel skills as for his discretion.

He has been credited with performing facelifts and various nip/tuck procedures on some of the biggest stars in the entertainment business - but the press-shy Novack was never one to drop names.

In 2012, the site Bungalux described Novack as the 'best plastic surgeon no one will recommend' because his famous patients pay top dollar to look like they've had no work done at all.

The glowing review stated that Novack schedules only three procedures a week and takes up to 12 hours per surgery.

‘His noses and facelifts are the best in the world, and he was one of the first proponents of fat transfer to the face,’ Bungalux raved.

It has been widely rumored that the youthful looking 'GI Jane' star Demi Moore, 51, had paid Novack close to $80,000 for various procedures, including a facelift, liposuction and surgery on her breasts.

In 2004, a friend of the actress said of Novack: ‘He's a fantastic surgeon and his clients don't look like they've had surgery.’

Moore herself, however, has vehemently denied that she had ever had any work done on her face or body.
