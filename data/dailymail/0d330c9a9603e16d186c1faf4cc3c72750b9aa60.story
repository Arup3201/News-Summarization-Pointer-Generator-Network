After her seemingly healthy daughter died during a jog Sunday night in Oregon, a mother expressed her overwhelming grief on Facebook.

'Grief comes in waves,' Tina Flynn Dixon wrote in a Facebook post post Tuesday night after her daughter died. 'I feel another about to rush over me.God help me...'

Dixon's daughter Bailey Whiting was only 17-years-old 
when she died during a jog with her mother in Roseburg, Ore., 
according to the Douglas County Medical Examiner's Office.

'She brought so much joy into this world,' Dixon told CBS affiliate KVAL. 'Everybody she touched was happier.'

Dixon said Whiting, a junior at Roseburg High School, was jogging with her along Roberts Creek Road when Whiting slumped over and collapsed. Whiting was taken to the Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, where she was pronounced dead, according to The News-Review.

The initial autopsy was inconclusive and doctors are conducting more tests to determine Whiting's cause of death, according to the Douglas County Medical Examiner's Office.

Following her daughter's death, Dixon wrote on her Facebook wall Wednesday that 'Mornings....hurt'.

Receiving dozens of comments of support from friends, Dixon also wrote Tuesday morning, 'I don’t want to wake'.

'Life no longer makes sense,' Dixon wrote Monday with a picture of her and Whiting enjoying ice cream cones.

'Thank you for all your prayers but honestly im feeling like im dying inside,' Dixon wrote on her wall Tuesday afternoon. 'I know I shouldn't post such negativity but I just ..oh I don't know.'

Dixon told KVAL she couldn’t put down the shoes Whiting wore during her jog Sunday.

'In these shoes she took her last steps,' she said. 'They brought her to wherever she ended up. These shoes carried her there.'
