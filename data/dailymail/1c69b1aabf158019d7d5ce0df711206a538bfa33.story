Voters could have to go back to the ballot box for a second general election next year if Scots choose independence.

That’s because Scottish MPs could be removed from Westminster within months of a Yes vote in the referendum.

This could potentially trigger another election as the abolition of the 59 Scottish seats could change the balance of power.

Senior Tories warn David Cameron could go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union

If Labour wins a slim majority, 
experts have said it would leave Westminster with a ‘zombie government’,
 forced to limp on as a minority administration.

This
 is because Ed Miliband’s party is particularly reliant on Scottish 
seats to bolster its power. It won 41 seats north of the border in 2010,
 whereas the Conservatives have just one Scottish seat.

While
 elections are meant to be held only once every five years, a snap  
election can still be triggered if there is a vote of no confidence in a
 government.

There are even calls from Tories to oust Scottish MPs before the 2015 election.

This would deprive Scots of a vote in the general election, as well as removing all  Scottish seats.

However, David Cameron knows this would project a negative message ahead of the September 18 referendum.

Some Tories even say Mr Cameron will have to resign if Scotland votes for independence.

One
 senior Conservative said Mr Cameron would ‘go down in history as the 
Prime Minister who lost the union’ and would have no choice but to quit 
Downing Street.

Protest: A pro-independence rally in Edinburgh. The no to independence campaign's lead is thinning

Other Tory 
MPs called for a law change to block Scottish voters from taking part in
 the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year.

Votes in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18.

Recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising, with the no campaign’s lead narrowing.

In a major political headache, if Scotland votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016.

It
 means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to 
take part in the 2015 general election to choose MPs for Westminster.

Senior Tories now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election.

The
 move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election 
next year, wiping out a significant section of Labour's powerbase and a 
sizeable number of Liberal Democrats.

In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP.

First Minister Alex Salmond has been buoyed by polls showing a narrowing between the Yes and No campaigns

So far, there has been no decision on what would happen to Scotland's Westminster seats between parliamentary elections and March 2016, when it would become an independent nation, in the event of a yes vote this autumn.

It is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but Scottish MPs would then vacate their seats when links are severed.

Tories believe it would unacceptable, however, for them to hold their seats while London and Edinburgh were negotiating the break-up of the UK

Scottish-born John Stevenson, who represents Carlisle, told The Times: ‘Why should the peoples of Northern Ireland, Wales and England have laws passed in this House by MPs who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country?’

Downing Street insists Mr Cameron is focussed on winning the referendum to keep Scotland in the UK, so the issue will not arise.

But privately many Tories believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence.

A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister is focused on making the case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.’

A record 4.1million Scots are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum.

The
 figure is almost 60,000 more than in December 2012 and has been fuelled
 by 16 and 17-yearolds who are not eligible to take part in General or 
Scottish elections but can do so in the referendum.

Around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young Scots have signed up.

The
 figures have been compiled by the Electoral Commission's 15 Scottish 
electoral registration officers (EROs), following an annual canvas of 
voters between October 2013 and March 2014.

The
 deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is 
September 2, 2014. Andy O'Neill, head of the Scotland office at the 
Electoral Commission, said: 'The snapshot provided by the publication of
 the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already 
put in by electoral registration officers, but that hard work doesn't 
stop now.

'The EROs will 
continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to 
take action and get themselves registered before the September 2 
deadline, in order to take part in the referendum.

'The
 commission will support EROs activities by launching a public awareness
 campaign in the summer, reminding people that the only way to vote at 
the referendum is to be on the register.'
