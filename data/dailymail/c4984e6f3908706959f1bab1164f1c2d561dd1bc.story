Stuart Lancaster is convinced Semesa Rokoduguni will cope with the searing pressure of an England debut against the All Blacks — aided by the perspective gained from his active service in Afghanistan.

The national coach yesterday confirmed that Bath’s Fijian-born wing — a Lance Corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards — would line up on the right flank opposite New Zealand’s try-scoring phenomenon, Julian Savea.

The collision between the tank-driving soldier and a fellow power-runner of Polynesian descent, known as the ‘Bus’, will provide a focal point at Twickenham on Saturday as England start their QBE autumn series against the world champions.

The Fijian-born winger's aerial skills will certainly be tested by All Blacks fly-half Aaron Cruden 

Such exalted visitors and a high-stakes occasion in front of a full house of 82,000 at HQ make for a daunting prospect for a newcomer, but Lancaster understandably believes the only uncapped player in his starting XV will handle a situation far removed from the life-and-death danger he faced on a tour of duty in Helmand Province.

‘He’s probably one of the least nervous players in the squad,’ said Lancaster. ‘In training we put the players under a lot of pressure, in various scenarios. I haven’t seen him make an error. 

'The different experiences he has had — not just within rugby but outside the game — have given him that confidence to be ready for a game like this. You never really find out until you put them in the front line, but he’s got the necessary experience.’

Rokoduguni's performances for the Army on the Sevens circuit caught the eye of Bath coach Mike Ford 

The front line is familiar territory for Rokoduguni, 27. The military life was a family tradition which he embraced from the age of 19 until, as he put it, ‘rugby started popping up’ — first with the Army, then with Bath and now with the country he has made his home and for which he has fought.

Soon after being deployed to Afghanistan, a colleague on patrol stepped on a landmine and lost both legs. That memory stays with him and has spurred him on to chase his ambitions with gusto. 

‘Every single time I join the camp, here or at Bath, I always think about this stuff — going back three or four years when that incident happened and that marine soldier was badly injured,’ he said.

‘It gives me a boost to make the most of every opportunity because you don’t know what’s going to happen next. It could be you. There could be a serious injury on the rugby field. You have to give everything you’ve got.’

Despite the vast contrasts between his burgeoning rugby career and the military one which has been placed on hold, Rokoduguni actually accentuates the similarities. He argues that both occupations require diligence, precision and a band-of-brothers commitment to teamwork and supporting mates alongside. It’s just that the consequences of mistakes vary wildly.

Looking ahead to his Test debut, he said: ‘It is similar to the pressure I felt out there in Afghanistan, especially in the field. Out there in Afghanistan you had to be spot on with your drills, be punctual, dress correctly and be disciplined. You had to be alert every single moment.

‘That sort of mentality fits in well on the rugby pitch. You need all those key points out there on the field. The only difference is that here, there is always a next time. Next week you can come back stronger and better. Out in Afghanistan you have to be on top of your drills every single time because if you mess up that can cost someone their life.’

At this time of year, it was especially poignant to see a soldier wearing a poppy and reflecting on the prospect of national service of a different kind. Rokoduguni appreciates the significance of the timing, while the country has been marking the centenary of the start of World War One.

‘It’s a massive thing, especially on Remembrance weekend,’ he said. ‘It’s not just representing England, my family and Bath; it’s representing the whole Armed Forces in Afghanistan, back in their units. I’m representing every single one of them.’

On a lighter note, the messages Rokoduguni has received have contained a few digs from Army colleagues whose hearts lie north of the border.

‘Some of the lads have said, ‘You deserve it, you’ve done well’,’ he said. ‘But my unit is a Scots unit, so some of my Army team-mates are saying, ‘Why are you playing for them? You should be playing for Scotland!’

England are glad to have him, in a rejigged back line. As expected, Kyle Eastmond’s scorching form for Bath earned him another shot at inside centre. He will form a midfield alliance with Brad Barritt, who has been recalled, according to Lancaster, to provide balance as a carrier who can get over the gainline and off-load.

The head coach insisted that the untried 10-12-13 axis of Owen Farrell, Eastmond and Barritt has shown great cohesion in training.

What the hosts can’t match is the All Blacks’ unrivalled experience. England’s line-up is far more youthful, as Lancaster jokingly acknowledged, saying: ‘We were watching a game the other day, I think it was from 2003 — before the World Cup and Richie McCaw was playing in it. Dan Carter was on the bench. Most of our players were about 10 years old at that point!’
