Guilty: Jack McCullough was living in Seattle when new evidence re-opened the case in July 2011

A former Washington state policeman convicted of kidnapping and murdering a young Illinois girl more than a half century ago was sentenced Monday to life in prison.

Jack McCullough, 73, was convicted in September in one of the oldest unsolved crimes in American history and was given the maximum sentence for the 1957 murder.

The sentencing took place in Sycamore, the small community where 7-year-old Maria Ridulph was abducted and killed 55 years ago.

Like McCullough's trial, it was expected to be emotional for members of Ridulph's and McCullough's families, as well as 63-year-old Kathy Chapman, a childhood friend of Ridulph's who was with her until moments before she was abducted.

Judge James Hallock admonished an unrepentant McCullough for turning to face Ridulph's family and friends as he spoke before sentencing.

The judge ordered McCullough to face the bench, but McCullough kept pivoting toward the gallery.

'I did not, did not, kill Maria Ridulph,' said McCullough, who grew up in Sycamore.

'It was a crime I did not, would not, could not have done.'

He pointed to a box that he said contained 4,000 pages of FBI documents, which his lawyers argued supported McCullough's alibi that he was not in Sycamore the day of the crime. The judge ruled it inadmissible because the people in the documents were dead and could not be cross-examined.

Tragic: Maria went missing in 1957 after a man who called himself 'Johnnie' offered to give her a piggy back ride one night and her friend had run home to get mittens

Victory: Kathy Chapman (left) was the childhood friend who was with Maria Ridulph on the day that she was kidnapped

Support: She was joined by Mary Hunt, the murderer's half-sister who testified against him in the trial

McCullough's attorney said that ruling likely will be part of an appeal.

Before the sentencing, a prosecutor, 
Victor Escarcida, said that McCullough had 'left a lifetime of emotional
 wreckage in his wake.'

'Jack McCullough made Sycamore a scary place,' Escarcida said.

'Now there was a true boogeyman living among them. He is the definition of evil.'

Prosecutors
 contended that on December 3, 1957, a then-17-year-old McCullough, 
known then as John Tessier, approached Ridulph and Chapman in front of 
Ridulph's house and played with them for a while, offering to give them 
piggyback rides.

End to the mystery: Pat Quinn and Charles Ridulph, the brother and sister of Maria, answered questions outside the courthouse after the sentence was handed out

Justice: Former DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell helped prosecute the case

When 
Chapman ran home to get her mittens, prosecutors said, McCullough 
dragged Maria into an alley and choked her with a wire, then stabbed her
 in the throat and chest.

Prosecutors
 say that he then loaded her body into his car and drove more than 100 
miles to where he disposed of her body in a wooded area.

Ridulph's
 disappearance drew national attention during a massive, months-long 
search before her body was found the following April.

President Dwight Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly asked for regular updates on the case.

Ultimately, members of his own family helped convict him.

Accused: Jack McCullough, then 18, went by the 
name of John Tessier and lived a block away from Maria Ridulph's family 
in Sycamore, Illinois but after his alibi cleared him of involvement he 
left and changed his name

During the trial, Janet Tessier, 
McCullough's half-sister, described McCullough's mother making 
incriminating comments about McCullough on her deathbed in 1994.

Janet claimed 
their mother, Eileen Tessier had told her on her deathbed: 'John did it,
 John did it - and you have to tell someone.'

She told the court: 'She was very agitated and emotional and she expressed a great deal of guilt.'

His
 two other half-sisters said McCullough never returned home the night 
the seven-year-old girl vanished but their mother told police he had.

Katheran Caulfield said she stayed up
 until at least 11:30pm on the night the child vanished but never saw 
her brother come home.

But she claimed her mother told police he had been home that evening.

The mother acknowledged that she had lied to police when she supported McCullough's alibi.

After the initial 1950s case went cold, Tessier, as he was known then, left the Chicago area, joined the United States Army and changed his name to Jack McCullough.

He had told investigators that he was on a train to Chicago to get a medical exam before enlisting in the Air Force, but his then girlfriend later found the Rockford-to-Chicago train ticket from that day that was unused and unstamped.

Maria's remains were exhumed from her grave in July 2011 so that modern-day forensic scientists may be able to find DNA evidence to implicate McCullough that could not be detected in 1958.

Once a new investigation was launched,
 authorities went to Chapman, Ridulph's childhood friend, and showed her
 an old photograph if McCullough.

A half century later, she identified him as the teenager who came up to them that snowy day and introduced himself as 'Johnny.'

McCullough did not testify.

McCullough was one of more than 100 
people who were briefly suspects, but he had what seemed like a solid 
alibi. On the day the girl vanished, he told investigators he'd been 
traveling to Chicago for a medical exam before joining the Air Force.

Maria's
 remains were exhumed from her grave in July 2011 so that modern-day 
forensic scientists may be able to find DNA evidence to implicate 
McCullough that could not be detected in 1958.

Sycamore
 police chief Don Thomas explained: 'He matched the description of the 
suspect, he wore the same clothing, he had the same first name 'Johnny.'

'We were able recently to totally disallow (McCullough's) alibi with fresh information and new interviews.'

McCullough eventually settled in Seattle, working as a Washington state police officer.

Maria's murder is not the only atrocity of which the former cop has been accused of committing in the past.

Gone: Maria Ridulph's body was exhumed last year in order to find new DNA evidence after McCullough's ex-girlfriend provided new evidence that cast his alibi into doubt

McCullough was indicted on one count 
of child sexual assault and four counts of indecent liberties with a 
child in October last year according to the Illinois State Police and 
the Dekalb County State's Attorney's Office.

The victim had told investigators that McCullough raped her when she was 14 in Sycamore, the statement said.

A
 probable cause statement filed by Seattle police in conjunction with 
McCullough's arrest in June said that a runaway teenage girl who met 
McCullough - who used to go by the name John Tessier - in the early 
1980s accused him of sexually assaulting her.

He was convicted of unlawful 
communication over his interaction with the girl and fired from his job 
with the police in Milton, Washington, the Seattle statement said.

The
 former police officer had also been accused of raping one of his 
14-year-old half-sisters 50 years ago before being acquitted after two 
key witnesses changed their testimony in court in April this year.

The
 alleged victim, now 64, gave emotional testimony about being sexually 
assaulted by Jack McCullough, now 72, and two friends in 1962 - but in 
the end, too much time had passed.
