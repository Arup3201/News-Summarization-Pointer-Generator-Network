Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has blasted Mario Balotelli, claiming that he would be shocked if the striker is still at Anfield next season.

Speaking post-match on Sky Sports, the former Reds centre half, along with Jamie Redknapp and Graeme Souness, gave their thoughts on a lacklustre Liverpool display, and lambasted Balotelli's contribution.

'I can't change the way I feel about Balotelli, and that is nothing to do with what he's done in a Liverpool shirt,' Carragher said. 'It's what he's done at Manchester City and AC Milan.

Mario Balotelli was criticised after Liverpool's 3-0 loss to Real Madrid at Anfield on Tuesday night

Jamie Carragher, Jamie Redknapp, Graeme Souness and Jeff Stelling discussed Balotelli after the match

'Do I think he's going to be here long-term? No, I'd be surprised to see him here next season if I'm being honest.'

Redknapp followed up Carragher's comments with his own assessment - instead blaming Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers for bringing Balotelli to the club in the first place.

'I don't blame Mario Balotelli, I blame Brendan Rodgers for bringing him here. How he thought he could turn around a player who (Jose) Mourinho, (Roberto) Mancini and (Cesare) Prandelli have all washed their hands of.

Michael Owen also had his say on Balotelli via his Twitter account, claiming he has lost some respect

'There’s a reason when you go to the supermarket and something is half price. 

'Why on earth they went for him I’ll never know. They should’ve just left him alone. The fact that they went and got him, it just doesn’t make any sense to me.'

Liverpool signed Balotelli for £16million in the summer, which could have been a bargain. Carragher though, insists the purchase must have been rushed.

Carragher claimed that the purchase of Balotelli was a 'panic buy' from Brendan Rodgers

'It was a panic (buy). They were on the verge of selling Borini to Sunderland and they were going to go into the season with Rickie Lambert really. Daniel Sturridge is there but he’s got massive injury problems – he always has and he always will. 

'We needed someone. Who was available? Who knows who Brendan Rodgers and his scouting staff went for but they left it too late.

'A lot of players have come in, they’re doing a decent job here and there but none of them have really done anything. They bring Balotelli in late on, they think they get can something out of him for £16m. It’s obviously a panic.'
