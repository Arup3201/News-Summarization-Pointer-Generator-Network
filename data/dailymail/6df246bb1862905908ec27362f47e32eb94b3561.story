Tragic: John McAllister, 37, died trying to save his dog who was also killed

The father of a man who died after 
plunging into a freezing loch trying to save his dog has told of his 
horror as he heard his son scream his last words.

John McAllister, 37, ran from the 
family home with an inflatable mattress after spotting his dog 
struggling in the ice from a bedroom window.

He pushed his way 30ft across the ice 
to rescue the pet – then just as he had her in his grasp, the mattress 
they were on sank into the freezing water and they drowned.

His father Roddy, who had been walking
 the mongrel called Tain, was screaming at the side of the loch as he 
heard his son’s last words – ‘I need help.’

Speaking at the side of the Gadloch in
 Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, yesterday, Mr  McAllister Snr, 56, said: ‘The 
dog was squealing and splattering in the water, so John grabbed the 
mattress and waded into the water to save her.

‘I called him back at one point because it was getting dark and I started to worry.

‘I told him I wanted to fix some rope around the mattress.

‘But Tain was nearly in his grasp, so he carried on.

‘He managed to get to her and had her in his arms. Then he shouted his last words, “I need help”.

‘I was screaming from the side of the loch, everybody in the village could hear me. Then it went silent. I knew he was dead.’

Mr McAllister Snr was then forced to 
wait for nearly two hours by the side of the loch with other family 
members while emergency services hunted for his son and the dog.

Their bodies were brought out of the water around 7.30pm on Sunday night.

Last night, Mr McAllister Snr, a 
professional dog walker who has walked pets around the loch for 30 
years, said his son was a ‘hero’.

Fighting back tears, he added: ‘He was so brave. I will always remember him as a hero.

‘It was just instinct for him to go 
in. He was just so unlucky. If it  happened today, he would have been 
alive because the ice would have been harder and Tain wouldn’t have 
fallen in.

‘He was telling me just before he died that he was going for a drink at the pub after.

‘He was such a good boy. It just hasn’t sunk in for either me or his mum. It’s just terrible.’

His wife Sandra, 56, was too upset to speak.

Mr McAllister Jnr had taken over his 
father’s family business and was working as a landscaper. He had been  
due to start a big project in Edinburgh yesterday.

He lived near his parent’s home in 
Lenzie, but had been staying at their house for a few days, sleeping on 
the inflatable mattress. Emergency services were called to the scene 
around 5pm on Sunday.

Mr McAllister Jnr’s body was recovered
 following an extensive search by police divers, a helicopter and fire 
crews using a thermal imaging camera. It appears that,  as he rescued 
the dog, she was frightened and her claws burst the mattress.

It is thought he died clutching his beloved pet. Police described the accident as ‘a tragic incident’.

Yesterday, neighbours spoke of the tragedy that has left the whole community devastated.

Neighbour Robert Ralston, 40, said: ‘I was so shocked to hear what happened.

‘I’ve known him for more than 20 years and he was such a hard- working man. He loved dogs.

‘His family were big dog lovers. I used to see them passing all the time with the dogs. They loved walking them.’

Another neighbour said: ‘He was the 
nicest man you would ever meet. I had known him since he was a wee boy 
and his family had lived in the house their whole lives. It is a 
terrible tragedy to happen in the run-up to Christmas.’

Mrs McAllister’s father-in-law, Robert McVicer, 79, arrived at the family home yesterday.

He said: ‘He was a lovely, quiet boy. 
There’s nothing we can say to the family to make it better but we are 
here to comfort them.

‘It’s such an awful time. Christmas time will always be a time of remembrance now.’

The Gadloch area at Lenzie, near 
Kirkintilloch, is used by scores of dog walkers. In winter, when the ice
 is thick enough, the Gadloch is used for curling.
