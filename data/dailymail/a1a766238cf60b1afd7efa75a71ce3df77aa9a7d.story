Amir Khan has become a dad for the first time after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Friday.

The former WBA and IBF light-welterweight king, and his wife Faryal, have given their daughter the Arabic name of Lamysa, which means 'soft to the touch'.

Khan, 27, announced the news on Twitter and later posted two photos of himself cradling Lamysa.

He tweeted: 'Faryal and I are delighted to announce the birth our first child Lamysa Khan everyone doing very well, thank you for all your wishes.'

A later tweet read: 'Mine and @FaryalxMakhdoom New born baby LAMYSA. Born on 23rd May 2014 at 4:05am Â£Blessed'.

Khan and his wife met when she was a political science student in New York and got engaged in 2012.

The couple married in June last year at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, before returning to the UK for another ceremony attended by more than 4,000 guests in Amir's hometown of Bolton.

In an interview before his daughter's birth, Khan revealed he was ready to settle down and become a family man.

He
 said: "The past couple of years, have been crazy - fighting, boxing. 
I've lived that single life, but it is the right time to settle down and
 be with the wife and have my own little family.

'Becoming a dad will help with my boxing, for sure.

'The baby will keep me settled for sure 
because there will be someone to look after. I'll have my wife and my 
baby girl to look after.'

But he 
insisted he was not ready to retire from boxing as he said: 'I will have
 a family to look after so I will have to be much more smart.

'I
 always said I would get out at 28, but I think I will be too young. I'm
 getting better and I can see I'm getting more mature and stronger.'

He
 added: 'I think it will be 30 plus. The wife won't be happy, but I can 
go on. Even the fights I've lost, they've been knock-outs, but I've 
hardly had any punishment. I've never been beaten up.

'I will know when to stop when I am making mistakes, silly mistakes.'
