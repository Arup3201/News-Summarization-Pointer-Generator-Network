Pascale Sherwin started caring for Olivia when she was only six months old

A wealthy couple who noticed clothes and jewellery going missing discovered the culprit was their nanny - after they spotted her wearing them on Facebook, a court heard.

Parents Becki and Bradley Cannings, from Exeter, Devon, were left baffled after designer fashions and other possessions like bracelets and earrings began gradually going missing.

But Mrs Cannings, 29, was left devastated after her mother spotted the family nanny Pascale Sherwin, 23, on Facebook - wearing her stolen clothes and jewels on nights out.

Mrs Cannings looked at the Facebook page and was stunned to see the images - some of which she was even tagged in.

It is believed Sherwin stole around fifty items of clothing, four items of jewellery, a pair of designer sunglasses, designer luggage and various other belongings.

The couple had been employing the nanny - known as Sasha - to look after their two-year-old daughter Olivia, but never suspected her as she was considered as ‘one of the family’.

Mrs Cannings printed out the pictures and took them to the police - but was told more evidence was needed.

The couple then decided to set up four cameras in the house and one outside and collected three days of footage that caught Sherwin in the act.

Sherwin was found with the clothes and a stash of stolen jewellery when police searched her home in Exeter, Devon.

Sherwin, now of Honiton, Devon, admitted theft from employers at Exeter Crown Court and was ordered to do 200 hours unpaid community work.

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Cannings said: 'Every week random things were going missing. It really started getting to me and I thought I was going mad.

'It did not add up. I started to make a list and realised just how much was going missing.

'I hate myself for it now but I started thinking if anyone I knew would do this. I feel stupid but I never once considered it would be her. She had become part of the family.

'Mum then looked on Sasha’s Facebook account and I felt physically sick. In her profile picture she was wearing all of my clothes and was doing so in several others.

'I was even tagged in them. I don’t know if she was just stupid or rubbing my nose in it. I have never felt so violated and my whole world came tumbling down.'

Mrs Cannings said despite the Facebook evidence, she till hoped Sherwin wasn’t the one stealing the belongings.

She said: 'I was still hoping it had been a big misunderstanding. I didn’t want to do any of it, but it was the only way we could prove anything.

'But viewing the footage was like sitting down to watch a horror movie.

'We thought we would be fast-forwarding a lot but within five minutes we caught her stealing a cardigan and putting it in her bag.

'On each of the three days she stole from us. We allowed her to build a relationship with our daughter and be part of her everyday life. This was the ultimate betrayal.'

Mr and Mrs Cannings first met Sherwin, a qualified nanny, when she was working at a creche in November 2011.

She took a shine to Olivia and offered to do babysitting and after a few casual shifts, started looking after her a couple of times a week in January 2012.Mrs Cannings said: 'We had her checked and she was highly regarded and professional trained as a nanny.

'She just seemed like a lovely girl and would update us hourly by text of photos of her with Olivia.

'She helped me get ready on the morning of my wedding and was at my daughter’s naming ceremony.

'She became part of the family and it seemed the ideal arrangement. By summer she was working longer, we had upped her pay and she had all the freedom in the world.'

In March 2012, belongings started to go missing around the house, but it was after the couple’s wedding day when jewellery given to Becki disappeared she started to panic.

The Cannings saw Sherwin as 'one of the family' and are devastated she would break their trust in her

Judge Erik Salomonsen said it was a serious offence because it involved a breach of the trust which the couple had vested in her.

Mr Cannings, 40, who owns an electrical engineering firm, said Sherwin has shown no remorse or said sorry for her actions.

He said: 'It makes my blood boil that she has not even apologised and has been laughing in our face. But she will have to live with a criminal record.'

His wife said they had been badly affected by the whole episode but said Sherwin’s sentencing was a way of putting a 'full stop' on the ordeal.

She said: 'We moved on a long time ago. But we can completely relax now knowing that justice has been served.

'I have so much faith in the police system - they were amazing. But this really affected us bad. Thankfully Olivia was so young she will not remember any of this.

'But I will not leave her with anyone now except for close family. She will be three in August and going off to pre-school this year so that should make things easier.

'I just wish I had not let my guard down - I was just so convinced it was not her.'
