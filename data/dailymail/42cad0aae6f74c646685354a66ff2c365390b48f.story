A woman called police today claiming she had been kidnapped by TV baker Mary Berry

A woman called the police claiming she had been kidnapped by the Queen of British baking Mary Berry today, officers have revealed.

Avon and Somerset Police were also called by a drunk man who wanted to find out the football scores this afternoon before proceeding to speak inappropriately.

The force has been publishing its calls on Twitter today in a bid to highlight how the emergency call system is abused and the kind of reports received on a daily basis.

Among the other bizarre calls was one from a woman in Bristol who said she had aliens in her living room and another reported seeing a cloud shaped like a hammer and believed it was a bad omen.

One man called 999 to report that Vodafone was robbing him because he had no service and another rung to get a number for an electrician after his lights went out.

Another man reported finding a melon on his doorstep cut into slices this evening and was advised by police the matter was 'not an emergency'. 

There were also some calls that needed to be passed onto the RSPCA, including one woman who was worried about an emu in a field and someone who claimed she saw a monkey near Bristol zoo.

Some even expected to use the force as taxi service, with a number of people calling for lifts with and one man in Burnham wanted to be taken to Tesco because he couldn't find his friend's house.

The force's first 24 hour 'tweetathon' started at midnight this morning and call handlers had already dealt with 1,800 calls by 7.30pm.

They are tweeting both 999 calls and those made to the non-emergency 101 number as well as statistics and advice after seeing a rise in the number of reports it is taking.

One man also called Avon and Somerset Police to say that Vodafone had been 'robbing him' because he had no signal on his phone

Becky Tipper, Call Handling Manager said: 'Every day we receive an average of 3,000 calls, 550 of which are emergency 999 calls. Last year 1 in 5 of these calls weren't emergencies.'

'During our tweetathon we will be giving an insight into "a day in the life" in our communications centre. 

'No two days are ever the same but we are hoping to show the huge variety of issues we deal with. 

'If we can help cut the number of unnecessary calls we receive on both 101 and 999, this will reduce call waiting times and improve the experience for callers who genuinely need our help.'

It comes at the end of a week long campaign to encourage the public to use the 999 and 101 numbers in the right way.

Some expected the force to be used as a taxi service like this man who wanted a lift to Tesco in Burnham

The fire service was called today after one woman believed she had aliens in her living room who were scared of fire and were threatening her
