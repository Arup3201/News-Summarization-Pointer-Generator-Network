Two ultra right wing football hooligans have been jailed for a savage assault on a group of English football fans in Rome last year.

The severe beating by a mob in a central Rome pub last November left 13 Tottenham Hotspur supporters injured and one fighting for his life in hospital.

Ashley Mills, a builder from Brentwood in Essex was almost killed after being stabbed in the femoral artery in his groin.

Scene of the crime: The Drunken Ship pub in Rome

Thugs wearing masks and crash helmets blocked the entrance to the pub and threw tear gas and smoke bombs to disorientate their victims before attacking them

The group were enjoying pre-match 
drinks in one of the city’s most picturesque squares, before Spurs 
played Lazio in the Europa League, when a gang of Italian ‘ultras’ began
 ‘a well planned’ attack.

Thugs
 wearing masks and crash helmets blocked the entrance, and sent tear gas
 and smoke bombs into the pub to disorientate their victims.

As the hooligans attacked with knifes, iron bars and paving stones, the Tottenham fans fled, along with some American tourists.

The Italians then rampaged through the square smashing windows and chairs.

Police later described the attack as ‘urban guerrilla warfare’.

On
 Monday a judge in a Rome court sentenced Francesco Ianari, 27, to four 
years and five months and Mauro Pinnelli, 26, to five years and six 
months for the brutal attack.

At
 the time the assault was blamed solely on Lazio ultra fans, who are 
notorious for their fascist and anti-Semitic beliefs. But both of those 
convicted are fans of rival Rome side AS Roma, which have their own 
equally violent right wing fascist fanbase.

It is thought that Lazio fans also took part in the attack, after being called in by the Roma supporters for extra manpower.

Ianari,
 a door to door salesman who was already serving a ban forbidding him 
from attending football matches, and Pinnelli, a builder, were arrested 
on the night of the attack near the pub.

Police
 used CCTV footage as well as mobile phone records to identify the 
attackers and trace their whereabouts. They were arrested on the night 
of the attack.

It is not the
 first time British football fans have been attacked in Rome. In 2009, a
 Manchester United fan was stabbed in the leg.
