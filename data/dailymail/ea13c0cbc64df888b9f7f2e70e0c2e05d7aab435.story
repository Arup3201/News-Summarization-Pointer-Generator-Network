Trial: Gary Cawthorne is accused of claiming to work for a modelling agency to lure a girl into toilets before groping her breasts

A businessman molested a teenage girl while posing as a freelance model scout for a top agency representing clients including Kelly Brook and Agyness Deyn, a court heard today.

Gary Cawthorne, 49, told the 16-year-old to strip off so he could ‘measure her’ before cupping her breasts in a toilet cubicle at a luxury central London hotel, jurors were told.

He then asked if she wanted bigger breasts before insisting she didn’t need cosmetic surgery, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Cawthorne, who has held a string of directorships with firms in the financial sector, said he had worked for reputable modelling agencies, including Select Model Management, which represents Ms Deyn and Ms Brook.

He also claimed the fashion brand Gap was among his clients.

The girl had first accompanied a friend who arranged to meet Cawthorne advertising herself as an aspiring model on the website Gumtree.com.

He said he had a vast knowledge of the industry and gave the girls the impression he could help them find work, jurors heard.

The girl, who cannot be identified, broke down in tears as she told how she was left in ‘shock’ after Cawthorne assaulted her.

Prosecutor Anita Arora told the jury: ‘This is a case about a man who took advantage of a young and naive girl who put herself in a vulnerable situation.

‘She and a friend put an advert on Gumtree advertising themselves as models.

‘As a result, the friend was contacted by a man called Gary and a meeting was arranged between the two girls and him.’

The girls initially met Cawthorne last
April 2 at the Grand Hotel in Northumberland Avenue, close to The 
Strand in central London, to talk about the modelling industry, Ms Arora
said.

A second meeting was organised two days later at the hotel, during which the two girls were also accompanied by a third friend.

‘Things took a slightly unusual turn,’ Ms Arora said.

‘He asked to measure the girls for what they would wear at some stage as models.’

Cawthorne and the girl went in a lift for a ‘fitting’, jurors heard.

‘She said she was feeling nervous, she had never done anything like this before.

‘They went in a toilet, not in a room, just her and Gary Cawthorne.

‘He asked if she was ok then asked her to take her clothes off, which she did.

‘He then pulled out a tape measure and started to take measurements including around her breast area and her legs.

‘He was making comments to her about her body and she felt uncomfortable.

‘She was shocked but she carried on.’

Claims: Cawthorne allegedly said he worked for the agency representing Kelly Brook and Agyness Deyn

Cawthorne then told the girl to take her bra off or the measurement would not be ‘accurate’, jurors heard.

She covered her breasts with both hands and let him measure her.

‘He cupped both breasts with his hands and said there was nothing wrong with them’, Ms Arora told the court.

‘She didn’t ask him to do that. She didn’t agree to that and that, say the prosecution, is a sexual assault.’

The girl initially kept quiet but confided in her mother a few days later, who demanded Cawthorne’s phone number, the jury heard.

‘She decided to make enquiries about whether he was a legitimate model scout.

‘He convinced her he was a professional involved in the field of finding models, effectively a freelance model scout.

‘He maintained he worked for reputable model agencies including Select Model Management in London.

‘She asked him about his clients and he mentioned Gap. She was impressed by how professional he sounded.’

Meeting: Cawthorne allegedly attacked his victim in the toilets at the Grand Hotel in Northumberland Avenue, London

But the girl’s mother became alarmed when Cawthorne told her he had a psychology qualification and was a ‘doctor of some sort.’

After contacting a modelling agency, who they said they had never heard of Cawthorne, the mother called police, jurors heard.

In a prepared statement, Cawthorne admitted being in contact with the girl and her friend but insisted nothing ‘untoward’ happened, adding: ‘I have no intention of touching someone without their permission.’

Cawthorne, of Plumstead, south-east London, denies sexual assault.
