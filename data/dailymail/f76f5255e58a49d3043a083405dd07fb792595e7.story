For decades, knitting has been the preserve of pensioners - a calming activity that can be undertaken in front of Coronation Street or on the bus home. 

But now the woolly hobby has been taken over by 18-25 year olds in nightclubs and concert halls up and down the country. 

The movement is all down to one woman -  Kelley D, 35, from London. 

Kelley D from London came up with the idea of Rave Knitting at a friend's house party in June. Since then, she has performed at Glastonbury and joined 2 Bears on tour

The TV producer has just got back from a UK tour with the dance music duo 2 Bears, who signed her up as their support act after witnessing her rave knitting a friend's party. 

There is also talk of her starring in their next music video. 

The concept is simple - Kelley starts off the knitting onstage with a pair of needles and several balls of neon yarn. 

Gradually, the crowd takes the ends of the wool and wrap themselves in it as part of the 'human knitting.'

Soon, the whole dance floor, glitter ball and speakers included, is an enormous giggling and dancing mass of UV-lit wool. 

Kelly told MailOnline: 'The wool is there to connect people, because  in dance music people have forgotten what the dance floor is about.

'It isn't about superstar DJ's - it's about the people. 

'With this there is a community spirit, like those old Northern Soul nights - it's about bringing fun back to the dance floor.'

Rave Knitting is already establishing itself as a genre of its own in the UK dance scene, but Kelley came up with the idea completely by accident during a late night at a friend's house last June. 

She said: 'I was back at a friend's house after my partner's birthday party and she had just got a new flatmate.' 

'I went into their room and found this big old school knitting bag - there was all these needles in it and crochet.'

She continued: 'I wrapped myself in the wool for a laugh, then came back into the room and put on this eastern European voice - calling myself the crazy rave knitter from Yugoslavia.' 

Kelley then took the character to a friend's birthday party, where she was spotted by the 2 Bears, who advised her to make it into a professional performance act and invited her on tour. 

Two days later she was contacted by someone at Glastonbury, who asked if the Rave Knitter could host a tent at the festival.

She said: 'It has been like a dream come true for me, it has been quite overwhelming how it has taken off.

'It's just a ball of wool.' 

The dance floor becomes an art instillation, as all of the dancers connected with UV-lit neon wool

She continued: 'I've had Zoe Ball interviewing me in Brighton and Norman Cook absolutely loves it, he asked me how I could scale it up for 20,000 people.

'I can't explain what it does, people have to come to the gig to see what it does for people. 

'It's like the dance floor becomes an art instillation because it is all floodlit with neon light - it's all of these colours binding people together.

'I am then only one with knitting needles, but the idea is we are knitting each other together, one person at a time - it's people knitting. 

'They all start attaching each other, it starts at the front and moves towards the back and the sides, it takes on a life of its own.'
