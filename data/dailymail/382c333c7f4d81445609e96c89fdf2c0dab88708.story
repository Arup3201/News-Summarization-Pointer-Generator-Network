Channel 4 went ahead and broadcast an uncensored repeat of its Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2012 last night despite hundreds of complaints about its vile jokes.

The panel show, presented by Jimmy Carr, caused outrage when it was first shown on Sunday. It featured comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden apparently getting drunk as they made lewd jokes about the Queen, Barack Obama, Usain Bolt and Susan Boyle.

Some of the most offensive comments – about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh – were made within minutes of the 9pm watershed.

No comment: Channel 4 bosses refused to break their silence over the furore surrounding Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012. Featured guests included  Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall,  James Cordon and Gabby Logan

Anger: Comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden were behind many of the offensive remarks on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the year 2012

Television watchdog Ofcom has 
received at least 160 complaints about the content of the prerecorded 
show and Channel 4 has received another 130.

It means Ofcom is coming under increased
 pressure to launch an investigation into why C4 bosses allowed the 
pre-recorded show to be broadcast at primetime during the Christmas 
holidays.

However that did not stop Channel 4 from broadcasting the quiz again at 11.35pm last night or editing its content.

Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch UK 
said: 'This show should have always been consigned to the latenight slot
 and should never have been on at primetime.

'It is postpub television but it was 
put out at a time when people are usually expecting shows such as 
Downton Abbey or Call The Midwife.'

Channel 4 chief executive David Abraham will return to his desk on Monday to find out whether Ofcom is to launch an inquiry.

Only one board member, Mark Price, responded to MailOnline's requests for a comment, saying only that it was not up to the board to make 'creative' decisions.

The C4 press office said its board members would not be making any comment. It repeated a request for us not to contact its chairman Lord Burns and said its chief executive David Abraham was still on holiday in Vietnam.

The only comment C4 would make was one issued on New Year's Eve which said: 'Big Fat Quiz Of The Year is a well-established comedic and satirical review of the year's events with well-known guests and was broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings.'

Silence: Despite at least 240 complaints from viewers, C4 has refused to comment on the furore

Conservative MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons culture select committee, said: 'The number of complaints speaks to the fact that the British public think that obscene jokes, not least about members of the Royal Family, are unacceptable. The management at Channel 4 ... need to be reminded that there are standards of behaviour that are required from public broadcasters. Channel 4 is in receipt of public money so it needs to be accountable to public opinion.'

Ofcom is likely to consider an investigation into the broadcast because much of the crude content came so soon after the 9pm watershed.

A media source said: 'Ofcom has warned in the past that there should not be an abrupt change in content after 9pm. It has said it is a "watershed not a waterfall" and consideration should be given to that.'
