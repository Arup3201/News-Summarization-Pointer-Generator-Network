'While I was in there this chap came from the front, bolted into the shop, grabbed knives then grabbed the boss and took her outside ... and threatened her, said local Donald McCaw.

'Then he took her outside and they were trying to quieten him down, trying to stop her doing anything, any harm.'

'He said I'll cut her throat, and everyone was around and they tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't.'

Police arrived at the scene and shot at the man, firing between six and eight shots.

The woman was allegedly stabbed during the incident, and was shot in the leg, reported Perth Now.

Mr McCaw said 'They [the police] were lucky to get shots in I think.'

The man is understood to have been fatally wounded, dying at the scene. 

The woman has allegedly been taken to Royal Perth Hospital with critical injuries, and remains in a serious but stable condition, reported Perth Now. 

Residents and relatives have arrived in the area and are reportedly upset. 

The street has been sectioned off from the community, and are allegedly investigating the incident in the area near the delicatessen.
