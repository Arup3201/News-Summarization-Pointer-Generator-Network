Christopher Weigl died on 
Thursday following a collision with a tractor trailer in the city

A university student who was killed after being struck by a tractor-trailer while cycling to a lecture chillingly wrote his own obituary for a class assignment just three months ago.

Boston University photojournalism pupil Christopher Weigl, from Southborough in Massachusetts, died on Thursday after colliding with the vehicle in Commonwealth Avenue, Boston.

In September the 23-year-old, who was the fifth cyclist to be killed in a road traffic accident in the city this year, wrote his own obituary as part of a class assignment.

In the obituary the former eagle scout, spoke about his passion for photography and love for the outdoors lifestyle.

He said that 'he cemented his love for photojournalism' during a trip to southeast Asia after finishing at Skidmore College.

The accomplished clarinet player gained the opportunity after enlisting with the volunteer organisation Operation Groundswell. He was given  the chance to uncover stories and assist with projects in both Cambodia and Thailand.

According ABC News his professor described Mr Weigl as 'the ideal student: smart, mature, curious.'

Police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr Weigl's death, but friends and relatives have paid warm tributes to the 'motivated but fun-loving man.

Mr Weigl was completing an accelerated one-year master’s photojournalism program at Boston University, and, in addition to past internships with magazines and photographers, he had already compiled an impressive portfolio of international work on his website.

His close friend Dan Herard said Mr Weigl was a modest but talented individual : 'He was so good at photography, but he didn’t rub it in your face or brag.

'You didn’t realise he was doing so well until you sat down and looked at his work and said, "This guy is going somewhere."'

Trottier Middle School Principal Keith Lavoie, who taught Mr Weigl, said it was obvious from a young age that Mr Weigl was going to aspire to great things.

One of his professors, Mitchell Zuckoff, gave Mr Weigl the obituary writing assignment on the first day of a feature writing class.

According to the Boston Globe Zuckoff says he uses the assignment to give students the opportunity to express themselves and for him to find out more about those he is going to teach.

Of course he never envisaged that the obituary would be used so soon after it was written.

Christopher’s words:"Lifelong Massachusetts resident and Boston University graduate student Christopher ­Weigl, 22, passed away September 5 after protracted complications stemming from obituary writing.Christopher was born in Framingham and lived most of his life in Southborough. An avid outdoorsman, Christopher obtained the rank of Eagle Scout at age 14 and remained an active member of Boy Scout Troop 1 till his 18th birthday.In addition to scouting, Christopher was an accomplished clarinet player throughout his years of schooling, and played in a variety of ensembles including the Central District Band and Orchestra, MetroWest Youth Symphony Orchestra, and Worcester Youth Symphony ­Orchestra.

during a trip to southeast Asia after finishing at Skidmore College

After graduating from Worcester Academy in 2007, Christopher matriculated at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Although eventually deciding upon a bachelor’s in English, photography supplanted ­music as the central passion of Christopher’s life, and he could often be found shooting campus events for the student paper or the school’s communications department.By graduation, Christopher had served as Photography Club president as well as photography editor of the Skidmore News. These pursuits were in addition to internships with Panorama Magazine, Emma Dodge ­Hanson Photography, and KCK Photography, as well as a semester abroad in Florence to take more specialized photography classes.After graduation, Christopher indulged his love of travel by embarking on a six-week trip through Operation Groundswell, a voluntourism organization, to find a story and do service projects in Cambodia and Thailand.

It was on the little Cambodian island of Koh Rong, where he interviewed locals and uncovered a government takeover of the island, that Christopher found a story and cemented his love for photojournalism.

The experience in Southeast Asia seeded the first thoughts of graduate school, and after a year of working at Ritz Camera, driving limousines, building a photography business, and freelance reporting for the weekly Community Advocate, Christopher moved to Brighton to ­attend BU’s photojournalism masters program.Christopher leaves his parents, Bonnie and Andy Weigl, his brother Dustin, and cat Ivy."
