Pope Francis warned during a visit to Albania today that religion can never be used to justify violence, making apparent reference to the bloodshed wreaked by the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

'Let no one consider themselves to be the armour of God while planning and carrying out acts of violence and oppression,' the pontiff said in speech at the presidential palace in Tirana in front of Albania's leaders.

'May no one use religion as a pretext for actions against human dignity and against fundamental rights,' he said. 'To kill in the name of God is a grave sacrilege. To discriminate in the name of God is inhuman.'

Pope Francis arrives at Tirana's Mother Teresa international airport this morning to begin his day-long visit

The Pope touched down in Albania this morning for a 11-hour visit with security tight amid threats from Islamic State militants.

While the Vatican insisted no special measures were being taken, Albania's Interior Ministry promised 'maximum' protection from 2,500 police and beefed-up patrols at border crossings.

Francis' interactions with the crowds were also much reduced compared to his previous foreign trips. His open-topped vehicle sped down Tirana's main boulevard, not stopping once for him to greet the faithful, as is his norm.

He said: 'All believers must be particularly vigilant so that, in living out with conviction our religious and ethical code, we may always express the mystery we intend to honor.

'This means that all those forms which present a distorted use of religion must be firmly refuted as false since they are unworthy of God or humanity.'

Francis has said it was legitimate to use force to stop the Islamic extremists, but that the international community should be consulted on how to do so.

Pope Francis has used the visit as an opportunity to denounce how religion has been 'perverted' to justify violence. 

Francis told Prime Minister Edi Rama at the start of his 11-hour visit Sunday that Albania's inter-religious harmony was an 'inspiring example' for the world, showing that Christian-Muslim coexistence was not only possible but beneficial for a country's development.

He said: 'This is especially the case in these times in which authentic religious spirit is being perverted by extremist groups, and where religious differences are being distorted and instrumentalized.'

It was reported Albanian law enforcement had flagged to Interpol concerns that Muslim militants who trained in Iraq and Syria had returned and might pose a threat to Pope Francis.

The Vatican has downplayed the reports, and Pope Francis has used the same open-topped vehicle he uses in St. Peter's Square.

That said, even at the Vatican security has been beefed-up in recent days: More barricades and police were out in force during Francis' weekly general audience this past week and Italian media reported security had been doubled.

Albanian police said they had the situation under control, though security was tight Sunday: People attending the pope's Mass were told to avoid wearing heavy clothing since they would be checked by police and not to bring bags, suitcases or glass bottles.

'There is no threat to the pope's security. We have undertaken all the measures and everything will go well,' police chief Artan Didi told reporters after a meeting with Interior Minister Saimir Tahiri on final security arrangements.

It is Francis' first visit to a majority Muslim nation since the Islamic State crackdown on Christians in Iraq.

During his visit, he will address Albanian authorities and an inter-religious gathering, celebrate Mass in a square named for Albania's most famous Catholic - Mother Teresa - and greet children cared for by charitable groups.

The capital's main Boulevard Martyrs of the Nation was decorated with Albanian and Vatican flags, as well as pictures of 40 Catholic priests who were persecuted or executed under Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, who declared Albania the world's first atheist state in 1967.

During this time, hundreds of priests and imams were jailed, scores executed. 

Francis paid tribute to these martyrs and those from other faiths, saying they showed witness to their faith even under persecution.

'Recalling the decades of atrocious suffering and harsh persecutions against Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims, we can say that Albania was a land of martyrs,' he said in his homily. Deviating from his text, Francis thanked Albanians for their ancestors' sacrifice, recalling the national symbol of the eagle.

'Do not forget your wounds, but don't avenge them,' he said. 'Go forward, flying on the hopes of a great future.'

Muslims make up about 59 percent of the population, with Catholics amounting to 10 percent and Orthodox Christians just under that.

The Pope's decision to visit tiny Albania before any major European capital is in keeping with his desire for the Catholic Church to go to the 'periphery'.

Albania is seeking European Union membership and his visit comes just a few weeks before he delivers a major speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

The visit also affords him a chance to visit a majority Muslim nation at a time when Christians are being persecuted, killed and forced from their homes by the Islamic State group in northern Iraq. The Vatican has voiced mounting concern about the exodus of Christians from lands where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years.

Last month the Pope, who has often condemned the concept of war in God's name, said it would be legitimate for the international community to use force to stop 'unjust aggression' by Islamic State militants who have killed or displaced thousands of people in Iraq and Syria, many of them Christians.
