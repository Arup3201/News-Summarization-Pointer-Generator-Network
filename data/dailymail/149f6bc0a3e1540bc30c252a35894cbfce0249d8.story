An obese chip shop worker lost a huge 9st after missing out on seeing his grandfather before he died, because he was too ashamed of his size.

Tolga Gunduz had been obese since the age of nine but ballooned to a top weight of 22st 8lb after becoming addicted to takeaways.

At his heaviest, the now 24-year-old would eat three chip shop dinners and a family-sized cheesecake every day.

Chip shop worker Tolga dropped from 22st 8lb (left) to 13st 8lb (right) by ditching his diet of junk food 

He was so ashamed of his body that he refused to visit his family in Turkey for five years, meaning he didn't get to see his grandfather, Sevket Sert, before he passed away.

Realising his weight meant he was missing out on quality time with his relations, Tolga, now living in Bristol, lost a massive 9st and has been named Cambridge Weight Plan's Man of the Year 2014.

A trim Tolga says: 'I was scared to go back to Turkey because they're such blunt people.

'I'd get there and family members would say 'you've put on weight' and 'you'll never get married being that big'.

His astonishing success, which involved stopping using food as an emotional comfort, has resulted in Tolga being named Cambridge Weight Plan's Man of the Year 2014

'I remember so many occasions when I was told I would die because I was so big.

'As a result I didn't go back for five years and didn't get to see my granddad before he died.

'When I realised I'd missed that final opportunity I knew it had gone too far - I had to make a change.'

As a nine-year-old boy he was told he needed to lose weight by a stranger in the street

Tolga had always been big, even being told as a nine-year-old boy that he needed to lose weight by a stranger in the street.

Despite being a keen footballer, he would sneak ice cream and sweets into his room to hide from his parents.

Throughout his school years in London, he continued to fill the unhappiness with his body by eating more and more junk.

As a teen he made constant excuses to not go to house parties because he was so ashamed of his clothes and appearance.

Tolga said: 'No matter what the weather I would wear 44 waist jeans, a 3XL t-shirt and cardigan - all in 'slimming' black.

'I was in this vicious circle where I wouldn't go out because I was embarrassed my clothes didn't fit.

'To cover that up I ate, which obviously didn't help.

'I'd always tell friends I had family occasions so they didn't see me in the same clothes over and over again.'

At 18-years-old and weighing 19st, Tolga went to university and moved out of his parents' home.

Due to his unhealthy student lifestyle, his weight shot up by a further two stone before he failed his first year.

Having reached his peak weight of almost 23st (left) and missing out on almost all of his teenage years, Tolga decided enough was enough and radically overhauled his diet 

To cover up his disappointment at having to re-sit exams, he continued to eat, even when the family relocated to Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to open a chip shop.

Tolga didn't get to see his granddad, Sevket Sert, before he passed away

Despite passing his re-sits, Tolga rejected an offer to return to university and focused on the family business.

He said: 'A whole life of being told I was fat really knocked my confidence.

'I didn't think I could chase the uni dream so I carried on working in the chip shop.

'It was my first job and in a strange place I was nervous and confused, so just kept on eating junk and drinking.

'At this point I was eating three to four takeaway meals per day and downing at least a bottle of rose.

'I was so ashamed that, not only did I not go to Turkey for five years, I didn't go back to London to see friends for two years.'

Having reached his peak weight of almost 23st and missing out on almost all of his teenage years, Tolga decided enough was enough.

He joined the Cambridge Weight Plan and, with the help of his consultant, Mitch Jones, confronted his problems instead of stuffing them with junk food.

Within the first week, he shed more than a stone, followed by a further 7lb in the second week.

Tolga said: 'I felt incredible - it was the lightest I'd been in almost four years.

'Whenever family came round, instead of hiding in my room, I'd welcome them at the door.

'In the second month I had the confidence to go back to London and see my friends.

'They were amazed with my progress and so I decided to go over to Turkey.

Breakfast: Two Gregg's chicken baguettes, two chicken pasties, four doughnuts, two cans of Monster energy drink

Snack: Battered sausage sandwich from own chip shop

Lunch: Chip roll and a battered sausage

Dinner: A takeaway followed by a whole New York cheesecake washed down with at least one bottle of rose wine

Breakfast: Porridge

Snack: Banana or handful of fruit and nuts

Lunch: Low carb meal e.g. chicken breast and brown rice

Dinner: Fish or meat with either salad or vegetables

Snack (if hungry): A smoothie, piece of fruit or green tea 

'In the space of that fortnight I did two of the things I couldn't face for two years.

'In total I've lost nine stone, all while working in a fish and chip shop - I feel invincible.'

After being named the Cambridge Weight Plan Man of the Year 2014, Tolga has decided to help people in a similar situation.

He has decided to become a Cambridge consultant and has relocated to Bristol to pursue that dream.

He said: 'Ever since I started the plan, life has been unbelievable.

'I've rediscovered my lust for life and found the real me.

'I can't thank Mitch enough - he's been like my big brother.

'Now I want to repay them - I feel like helping someone else will do that.'
