How do you stop the world’s fastest car? With the world’s strongest brakes, of course.

The team behind the Bloodhound SSC have revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour to zero.

The engineers based in Bristol have been trying to find brakes that can withstand the huge temperatures and stresses of the vehicle - and they might now have the answer.

The Bloodhound SSC is being built by a British team based in Bristol. The world record attempt will be made in South Africa's Kaksken Pan, a large patch of desert 2 miles (3 kilometres) wide and 12 miles (19 kilometres) long, in the coming years

The Bloodhound SSC is a supersonic car in development, with the goal of setting a remarkable new world land speed record.

A jet engine accelereates the car from rest to just over 300 miles (480 kilometres) per hour in about 30 seconds.

At this point the rocket is ignited, increasing accelerationto about 2g.

Maximum speed, 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometres) per hour, will be reached after about 55 seconds.

At this point the parachute and air brakes will be deployed, slowing the car to 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour with a deceleration of 3g.

It is here that the world’s strongest brakes, made from steel rotors, will then be applied, slowing the wheels from 10,000 revolutions per minute down to zero.

The British project, based in Bristol, hopes to break 1,000 miles (1,600 km) per hour in the coming years with former RAF Pilot Andy Green at the ‘wheel’.

To get to that speed requires extraordinary power, but figuring out how to then stop the thin steel wheels has posed a problem.

After the ‘car’ reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes will slow it to 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour.

Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60 miles (95 kilometres) per hour in a normal car to zero in one second - for 20 seconds.

This last stint to zero is where the problem lies, however.

Even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute.

The Bloodhound SSC (pictured) is a British attempt to become the first car in the world to break 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour, breaking the world land speed record in the process. The vehicle is currently under development with the groundbreaking run scheduled for some time in the next few years

The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’, because the Bloodhound will be going faster than the speed of sound.

The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both a jet and rocket.

It is designed to go over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour.

The slender body, 46 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic.

It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower.

That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together.

In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new  land speed record.

Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach.

Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing.

In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F).

They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again.

The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced.

But hopes are high that they could be the solution to bring the Bloodhound safely to a halt.

The current land speed record stands at 763.035 miles (1,227.985 kilometres) per hour, set by former RAF pilot Andy Green (who will also drive the Bloodhound) back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC.

The Bloodhound will beat this record by some distance if it is successful.

It will take the vehicle 55 seconds to accelerate to its top speed of 1,000mph (1,600kph), where a mile will be covered in just 3.6 seconds, and at this speed the drag on the car will be 20 tonnes. The brakes shown here might be the answer to helping slow the car from these tremendous speeds
