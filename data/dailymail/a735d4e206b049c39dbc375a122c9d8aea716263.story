'I'm proud to stand with Winston Churchill...and I've got to say my wife was fairly astonished,' Cruz said as he unveiled the tattoo.

After the hosts pressed him about his new ink, Cruz then confessed the truth. 'Look, I will note if you look at the calendar, it might suggest something about what you're seeing.'

Cruz said he was inspired to do the fake tattoo after he attended a fundraiser in California last month and saw this poster of him

The senator said he was inspired to get the tattoo after attending a fundraiser in Southern California last month in which organizers created a poster that featured a shirtless Cruz with tattoos all over his body and a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. The tagline on the poster read 'Ted Cruz's So-Cal "Blacklisted and Loving It" Tour.'
