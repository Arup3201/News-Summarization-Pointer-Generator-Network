Its residents have long been known as the mythical letter-writer Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells.

So the genteel Kent spa town should prepare to be outraged - because foul-mouthed beer-spitting heroin addict punk Sid Vicious could soon be given a memorial plaque.

The spiky-haired Sex Pistols singer, real name John Ritchie, attended the town's Sandown Court School for three years before leaving for London aged 14 in 1971.

He moved to a rented flat with his mother Anne and spent around six years in the area long before he was famous. His school still exists, renamed as The Skinners' Kent Academy.

Now his name has been put forward among those of 32 other famous former residents who could receive a plaque on their former homes.

Volunteers won funds from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council for 20 of the plaques, which cost around £300 each.

They defended their choice of the punk star - but said he will face stiff competition from war heroes and historians to make the final cut.

Alastair Tod, chairman of the Royal Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, told MailOnline: 'We're all prepared to argue the case if necessary.

Genteel: Royal Tunbridge Wells is the only spa town in the south east of England and has gained a reputation for 'disgusted' conservative letter-writers - even if most residents say the stereotype is unfair

'We would be prepared to defend the inclusion of any of the names on our list.

'It's only a longlist, though, and I think Sid Vicious is probably an outlier. It's not for me to make the final decision.'

Vicious died from a heroin overdose aged 21 in 1979 
after being arrested over his lover Nancy Spungen’s murder in New York.

His fame came from his anti-establishment behaviour and he routinely spat beer at fans, 
sneered at rivals, beat people up, swore non-stop and user
 razors to cut swear words into his body.

But he was also widely credited with changing the face of British music forever, opening the doors to the jarring electronic creativity of the 1980s, and galvanising one of the 20th Century's biggest shifts in pop culture.

The plaques will be dark red and round, and follow 15 which were put up in 2006 on the town's 400th anniversary.

The only criteria for the people to be featured was they had to have a genuine link with the town and have been dead for some time.

Among the local heroes being considered are soldier William Vidler, who died two days after the start of the First World War after his ship was hit by a mine.

Other plaques under consideration are airwoman Pauline Gower, who headed the female branch of the Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War, and historian Richard Cobb.

Some residents of the town were angry. One, Peter Campbell, 49, said: 'Nobody wants to be reminded that Sid Vicious lived here - he was a vile man who died as he lived, surrounded by filth and misery.

'He hardly has anything good to be said about him and it would be best is his name was scattered to the four winds.'

Another, Claire Fenwick, said the people of Tunbridge Wells were ‘not interested’ in the Sex Pistols, adding: 'The Sex Pistols were a passing fad that had nothing to do with Tunbridge Wells.

'They might have made it big in London, but nobody here cares about, or wants to be reminded, about them.'

The civic society plans to meet in less than two weeks to make their final decision - but their final choices will also have to be signed off by the local council.
