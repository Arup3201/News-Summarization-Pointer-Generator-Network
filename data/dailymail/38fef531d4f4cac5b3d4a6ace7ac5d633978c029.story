Still got it: Billy Connolly topped the poll voted for by his peers and the public

He's had audiences laughing for four decades, but now Billy Connolly has another accolade to add to his collection.

The veteran Scottish comic has been named the most influential British stand-up comedian of all time.

The 69-year-old funnyman saw off competition from Morecambe and Wise and Victoria Wood in the list compiled by 100 comics who then put their shortlist to public vote.

U.S. star Robin Williams took top honours for the international comics.

Stephen Merchant, Jack Dee, Miranda Hart, Jason Manford and Jo Brand were among 100 comics who compiled a shortlist, which saw Connolly, nicknamed the 'Big Yin' triumph over Morecambe and Wise.

Victoria Wood was third, and the only woman in the top 10. Eddie Izzard came fourth, followed by Ben Elton, Peter Cook, Les Dawson, Lenny Henry, Sean Lock and Rik Mayall in tenth place.

Steve North, head of TV channel Dave, which commissioned the poll, said: 'British stand-up is there with the best in the world.

'It is great to see trailblazing stand-ups such as Billy Connolly and Robin Williams get the respect they deserve.

'Both Connolly and Williams have 
consistently pushed the comedy envelope and whilst they may have over 40
years of experience between them, they are still the funniest men on 
the planet.'

A total of 2,000 adults took part in the
poll, commissioned by TV channel Dave to mark Dave's Leicester Comedy 
Festival in February.
