Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have been provided with a chilling list of dos and don'ts explaining how to treat the thousands of sex slaves held in the terror group's prison-brothels.

A document issued earlier this month by the group's 'Department for Prisoners and Women's Affairs' explains in sickening detail exactly who can be made a sex slave, when a woman should be beaten, and under what circumstances it is justified to rape prepubescent girls.

Up to 5,000 kidnapped women and children are held as sex slaves in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq controlled by ISIS, many of them in the group's stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa.

The vast majority of the captives are members of the Yazidi religion who were kidnapped during the Mount Sinjar massacre in early August. The rules state that these women can be imprisoned and raped on a daily basis by militants who purchase them as slaves for as little as £27 each.

Supporters: Taking the form of a 'Slavery for Dummies' guide, the document is laid out in a notably simplistic question and answer format designed to assist even the least intelligent jihadi in his treatment of sex slaves

Slavery: This 15-year-old Yazidi girl - who did want to be identified for fear of retribution -  escaped ISIS militants by drugging and shooting the two 'husbands' who bought her as a sex slave

The document outlining the rules by which Islamic State militants can take and hold slaves was released by the terror group's 'Department for Prisoners and Women's Affairs' on December 3.

The department, headed by a militant known as Abu Suja, helps the terror group enforce policy decisions made by the Shura Council - a kind of religious advisory body appointed by leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to study the Koran and make rulings based on their interpretation of sharia law.

Taking the form of a 'Slavery for Dummies' guide, the document is laid out in a distinctly simplistic question and answer format designed to assist even the least intelligent jihadi in his slave treatment.

The U.S.-based Middle East Media Research Institute obtained an original copy of the document, and published full details of it on the  monitoring group's website.

Answers are provided to sickening questions such as 'Is it permissible to have intercourse with a female captive immediately after taking possession?', and 'If the female captive was impregnated by her owner, can he then sell her?'.

While ISIS' sale of oil on the Middle Eastern black market has long been known, far less has been written about the terror group's import taxes and sale of antiques.

ISIS is believed to generate several million pounds a day, with approximately £400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil. 

A further £250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services  and electricity production.

Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds.

Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged £500 per journey, plus a further £250 tax for electronic good and £200 for food parcels.

However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command.

For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned £23 million in early 2014 alone by selling £8,00 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus. 

According to the document, slave women are known as al-Sabi by ISIS militants, and can only be taken from 'ahl al-harb' - any group of people with which the terror groups considers itself at war.

It goes on to make detailed cases for why polytheists and 'People of the Book' such as Christians and Jews are permissible to take as slaves, but explains the Islamic State 'leans toward accepting the consensus view' among Islamic scholars that ex-Muslims are not allowed to be captured.

The rape of a female captive, the document explains, is perfectly acceptable even for married men.

It then uses a passage from the Koran, which says Allah rewards Muslims who are chaste with everybody other their wives and 'those their right hands possess'.

The ISIS guide claims the above 'right hands' statement is a reference to captured women.

One chilling passage in ISIS' sex slave document explains that virgins can be raped immediately after their 'owners' purchase them. 

Those who have previously had sexual intercourse must have their uterus' 'purified' first.

Another line says it is legal to have sex with a prepubescent child providing she is 'fit for intercourse.' 

There is no further explanation as to what such a horrific statement may mean.

The document was released as it emerged dozens of young British women are using social media to boast of joining the Islamic State's terrifying all-female police force – claiming to be doling out savage beatings, punishment lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of Yazidi sex slaves are imprisoned and raped daily after being sold for as little as £27.

Britons including privately-educated Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood, 20, and Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, are understood to have joined the Al-Khansa Brigade in ISIS' Syrian de facto capital Raqqa, helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes.

The group, which is largely made-up of educated Western women, operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. 

One woman notorious for the references to the Al Khansa Brigade is British national Umm Farriss, who also calls herself Umm Anwar.

Earlier this year she described a chilling encounter with a Yazidi 'slave girl'. Umm Farriss claims she entered a building in the city of Raqqa and greeted the entire room. She then described in sickeningly mocking tones how the abused Yazidi sex slave offered a 'salam' [hello] in response.

ISIS has attempted to justify the keeping of sex slaves by claiming that members of the Yazidi religion are devil worshippers - making them worse than so-called 'people of the book' such as Christians and Jews, who can escape imprisonment by paying a monthly tax known as jizyah.

A woman aged 40 to 50 - 50,000 dinars (£27)

A woman aged 30 to 40 - 75,000 dinars (£40)

A woman aged 20 to 30 - 100,000 dinars (£53)

A girl, aged 10 to 20  - 150,000 dinars (£80)

A child under nine - 200,000 dinars (£106)

Captured Yazidis - whose belief system mixes elements from a range of religions and whose central figure of worship is a 'Peacock Angel' - are not able to pay their way out of jail, however.

Men and boys are told to convert to Islam or face immediate death, while women and children are often transported to Raqqa, where the Al-Khansa Brigade force them into sex slavery.

Earlier this month a chilling document emerged purporting to show the 'price list' for sex slaves.

According to the document, obtained by website Iraqinews.com, just £27 will fetch a Yazidi or Christian woman aged between 40 and 50. Chillingly, a child between one and nine will fetch four times that.
