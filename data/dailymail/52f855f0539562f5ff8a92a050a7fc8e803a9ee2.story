Mugger: Mona Haj Youssef, 24,  laughed in the dock at her sentence for mugging the widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves

A callous young woman who heartlessly mugged the brave widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves - who died two years ago on Christmas Eve - burst out laughing in the dock as she avoided jail.

Mona Haj Youssef, 24, launched a terrifying attack on Maureen Greaves, 64, punching her in the face just two days before the widow had to face the ordeal of the start of her husband Alan Greave's murder trial.

In the shocking Christmas Eve murder, Mr Greaves, 68, was brutally beaten over the head with a hammer just minutes after he left his home in Sheffield on his way to play the organ at Midnight Mass at St Saviour's Church in 2012.

The former social worker suffered severe head injuries when he was attacked by two men with a pickaxe handle and a hammer in the unprovoked attack.

He died three days later.

The devoted family man had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time when he bumped into Jonathan Bowling, 22, and Ashley Foster, 22, who were out looking for a random target.

Mr Greaves, a grandfather and father of 
four, was found by a delivery driver a short time later with 
‘catastrophic’ head injuries.

Jonathan Bowling admitted to Mr Greave's murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years.

Meanwhile, accomplice Ashley Foster was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years behind bars for the motiveless attack which provoked shock and outrage across the UK.

But in a cruel twist of fate just days before Foster’s trial was due to start, his kind-hearted widow Mrs Greaves was attacked outside shops by Youssef leaving her shaken, bruised and with a cut cheek.

Youssef, a former university student whose studies fell apart because she became hooked on drugs was given a two-year probation supervision order, 12 months’ mental health treatment and ordered to pay £250 in compensation for the assault.

But when she realised she had avoided jail, Youssef laughed and shouted: 'Yeah, £250.'

However, Mrs Greaves told how she was happy with the outcome.

She said she hoped the former drug user would get the help she needed, adding: 'I am pleased this went to court because it means she will get some help.

'Not only did she hit me, she was extremely angry. I’m glad she is going to be supervised by the probation service and get some treatment for her mental health problems. Hopefully she will be able to be in society afterwards and not harm people.

'It’s for her own good as well as everybody else’s.'

Shortly after Mrs Greaves was mugged she said: 'It was very frightening. The worst thing was it made me imagine Alan being attacked and what he was feeling.'

Youseef, of Sheffield punched Maureen in the face on June 22 last year.

At her trial at Sheffield Crown Court, Martin Ward, prosecuting, said Youssef grabbed Mrs Greaves handbag and swore at her before striking her.

'She swung towards her, hit her across the face, and knocked her glasses off,' he said.

Mrs Greaves dropped to the ground to try to find her glasses, but Youssef continued to hit her. The attack stopped when Maureen’s son Peter, who was walking ahead, realised what was happening and ran to help.

Youssef was found guilty in her absence at an earlier hearing of assault by beating.

Lucy Hogarth, defending, said Youssef had mental health problems which stem from drug abuse, but described her current mental condition as ‘stable’.

The chairman of the bench told her: 'You started off life as an intelligent young woman at university - this is where drugs get you.'

In a statement read to the court, Mrs Greaves said: 'It brought about a deep sadness and fear which I have never felt before.'

Youssef was also sentenced for stealing £151 worth of items from Tesco in a separate incident.
