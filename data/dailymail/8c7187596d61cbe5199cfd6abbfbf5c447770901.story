Lying lifeless on the bleached grass of a South African game reserve is the latest rhino to fall victim to poachers in their ruthless pursuit of the creatures' valuable horns.

This grisly photographs reflect the damage wrought by increasing numbers of poachers eager to exploit demand for rhino horn - which now has a street value higher than gold in some countries.

The rhino, which was shot at the Nwanetsi picnic site on the famous game reserve, is the 203rd to be poached in South Africa this year alone.

A total of 60 poachers have been arrested in South Africa in 2013 - 36 of those in Kruger National Park.

South Africa, which is home to an estimated 21,000 rhinos, saw more than 660 of the creatures slaughtered by poachers for their horns last year - an all-time high.

The illegal trade in rhino horn - used for centuries in Chinese medicine - is being fuelled by demand in the Far East, where it now fetches more on the black market than its equivalent weight in gold.

Demand: Rhino horn is now more valuable than gold, sparking a boom in the increasingly lucrative illegal trade

Vulnerable: A total of 36 poachers have been arrested in South Africa's Kruger National Park this year alone

The problem is not confined to 
Africa; there have also been cases of wild rhinoceros horns being stolen
from European museums, galleries and auction houses.

The boom in the trade has prompted 
scientists at the Scottish Government's Science and Advice for Scottish 
Agriculture (SASA) to begin collating a rhino DNA database to help snare
poachers.

SASA scientists have announced they are to send out sampling kits to museums and zoos across the UK to 
collect rhino DNA.

The samples
will be analysed to create a DNA database, which will help trace the 
origin of any stolen rhino horn intercepted by the police or customs.

It
was discovered that even DNA from 100-year-old horns from museums can 
be used in the database after the National Museum of Scotland took part 
in a pilot study with SASA.

The
aim of the project is to protect exhibits and also rhinos in zoos from 
criminal gangs who steal and sell rhino horn for thousands of pounds on 
the black market.
