A shocking video has surfaced of a furious driver bounding from his car and striking an L-plater through his window.

The dashcam vision, which was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, shows the learner driver returning from a fishing trip in a four-wheel drive.

While passing down a rural road in Yatala on the Gold Coast, a white Hyundai Excel overtakes the learner, swerving across the road before pulling up on the kerb.

The learner driver continues down the road until the Excel driver swerves in front of him a second time, slowing down to box him in.

The Excel driver then stops in the middle of the lane, cutting off the 4X4 and scrambling to get out of his car.

The learner attempts to swerve around the obstructing vehicle, at which point the excel driver bounds from the car sporting an slouch hat and board shorts.

While the vision does not directly capture the attack, the description for the video said the driver smashes the window and strikes the learner in the face.

The video has already had more than 56,000 views on YouTube, and 854 likes on the DashCamOwners Australia Facebook page.

The video has also attracted almost 500 comments, with most users voicing their support for the L-plater.

Jean Emerson wrote: 'Take care around L platers. They are just trying to learn. We were all there once! The oxygen thief in the Excel should have his licence revoked!'

Some were more sceptical, such as Luke Jackson, who wrote: ‘Wouldn’t mind seeing 5 minutes before this video to see what the learner did to make this guy so p***ed. you must have done something first.’

Kelsey Jade Pruden said: 'It doesn't matter if you did anything, there is never an excuse for behaviour like this.'
