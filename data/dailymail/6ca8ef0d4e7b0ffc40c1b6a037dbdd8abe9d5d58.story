The 'cowardly' sons of one of Britain’s richest men who randomly attacked two off-duty policemen on a night out walked free from court today.

George, 26, and Costas Panayiotou, 24, whose father Greek-Cypriot property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou is believed to be worth £400 million, attacked the off-duty officers in London's Soho on November 30 last year.

The duo, who were out with brothers Yiannaki, 30, and Christoper 
Stavrou, 28, at the time repeatedly punched and kicked the policemen even after they had been floored, the court was told.

The court heard how the men, who are sons of property tycoon Andreas (centre right), approached the officers - raining down punches on them even when they were on the floor in the violent attack in Soho, London

One of the officers they attacked needed titanium plates in his cheek and eye socket following the unprovoked attack, Southwark Crown Court heard.

In court today, Recorder Christopher 
Heheir said: 'The facts of the case to which each of you should be 
really ashamed are offences all too common to the courts.

'There is one way to describe this attack - cowardly. All of you behaved in a thoroughly cowardly way.'

Costas Panayiotou was given a 15-month 
sentence suspended for 18 months after pleading guilty to affray.

His brother George received six months suspended for 18 months after also pleading guilty.

Stavrou received six months suspended for 18 months and his brother Christopher got nine months suspended for 18 months.

All wearing smart suits and
 ties, the gang smiled and glanced at 
family and friends when their sentences were read out.

The five off-duty officers were leaving their Christmas party at the Strawberry Moon club Soho when they came across both the Panayiotou and Stavrou brothers.

When one of the officers yelled ‘Oi, purple baseball cap!’ at George Panayiotou, the group ran across the road and began raining blows on the officers.

The court heard how the gang rounded on the officers while Costas punched another random man returning home from a nightclub with his girlfriend.

Michael Hall, prosecuting, described the violence, saying: 'Then he [Costas] punches the off duty officer Gavin Collins, knocking him to the ground and either the punch or his impact with the ground causes an impacted fracture of his cheek and eye socket that requires surgery and the fixing of titanium plates and screws.'

Yiannakis Stavros then ran across the road and punched another officer, Matthew Holland, from behind.

He was then joined by the other two - who also punched Mr Holland as he retreated backwards.

Mr Hall added: 'Matthew Holland is then set upon by all four defendants, punching and kicking him, at one point finding himself on the ground, where they continued to punch and kick him.'

He continued: 'Mr Holland describes 15 blows down Regent’s Street and another 15 blows when first put on the ground at the junction of Cuckoo Club and Swallow Street.'

They only stopped when door staff from nearby clubs stepped in, the court heard.

Costas had three previous convictions for similar offences of common assault in 2010 and 2012, it was revealed in court.

During mitigation, it was said that all four defendants feel 'real shame and remorse' following the random attack.

Property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou - who is thought to be worth £400million - stands outside court

Sentencing them, Recorder 
Heheir said: 'The facts of the case to which each of you should be 
really ashamed are offences all too common to the courts.

'It didn’t seem like much alcohol had been consumed by anyone which makes what happened even more unfortunate.

'Your
 paths crossed...I say your paths crossed, but you were on the opposite 
side of Regent’s Street which is where you should have stayed.

'You
 George Panayiotou called your companions and all four of you crossed 
Regent’s Street and all demonstrated that you were more than ready to 
engage in violence.

'You 
Costas Panayiotou started off by punching in the face an entirely 
uninvolved member of the public who was walking with his partner.

'That didn’t deter you, you didn’t give a thought to who he was.

'Another police officer, Gavin Collins, tried to stop and your response was to punch him in the face.

'He
 sustained severe fractures to his face which ultimately required 
surgery. Although the surgery was successful, he is still suffering the 
effects of what you did.

'As
 if that wasn’t bad enough with two people already punched all four of 
you joined in the attack on Matt Holland - he was repeatedly punched and
 kicked including when he was on the ground.

'There is one way to describe this attack - cowardly. All of you behaved in a thoroughly cowardly ways.

'This was demonstrated by the fact when bigger and stronger people came - bouncers from the club - you stopped.'

As well as their suspended sentences, they
 will all serve 200 hours of unpaid work and have a curfew between 9pm 
and 6am, while Costas will pay £3,000 compensation, £100 surcharge and 
£750 costs.

Christoper will pay £750 costs and £100 surcharge, while George and Yiannaki will pay the same costs but £80 surcharge.

Andreas Panayiotou is CEO of The Ability Group - a company he founded in the mid-Nineties

Heath Hall - one of the properties bought by the property tycoon. He put it up for sale for £65million last year
