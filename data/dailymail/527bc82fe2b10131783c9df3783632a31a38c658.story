Martin Skrtel may have suffered a nasty cut to the head during Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday - but that did not stop him enjoying a day out with his family at Winter Wonderland.

Skrtel scored an injury time equaliser for Liverpool to earn a point, but had earlier suffered a horrible wound which required eight stitches during six minutes on treatment on the pitch. 

The Slovakia defender suffered the injury after feeling the full force of Olivier Giroud's boot.

But he was all smiles on Monday as he posed for a picture at the Christmas themed attraction with wife Barbara Lovasova and son Matteo.

Skrtel was bandaged up by the club's medical staff and later revealed the eight stitches in his head wound on Instagram.

He wrote: 'Dissapoiting (sic) with the result but happy to scored that late goal and helped the team to get at least the point'.

Liverpool physio Chris Morgan tweeted on Monday morning that it was the 'biggest cut I've been involved in dealing with!!'

He added: 'Only Crouchy versus Sheff U in '07 comes close and he had to come off.'

That was in reference to a head wound that Peter Crouch suffered during Liverpool's 4-0 win against Sheffield United in February 2007.

Morgan also gave insight into how he managed to stop the bleeding from Skrtel's wound.

In reply to a question on the treatment, Morgan tweeted: 'those staples went in on the pitch mate..we also used a clotting powder..then the compression..was bleeding a lot.'

He later added: 'the staples alone didn't stop bleeding..luckily the clotting powder then kicked in.'

Skrtel had earlier disappointed with his defending as he was beaten in the air by Mathieu Debuchy for Arsenal's equaliser just before the break.

But after the Gunners took a 2-1 lead, the Liverpool defender popped up in the 96th minute to ensure his side avoided their eighth Premier League defeat this season.

Skrtel earlier told Sky Sports: 'Obviously we wanted to get the three points today but being down one goal and to equalise in the last minute is good, but we are disappointed we couldn't win. 

'It was a great cross from Adam and I had a header before, but I've been waiting quite a while for a goal so I'm really happy.' 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers hailed Skrtel for his bravery. He said: 'He is a strong character, a real warrior, and thankfully he stayed on and scored a great header.'
