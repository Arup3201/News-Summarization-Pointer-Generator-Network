Armani Exchange has launched a set of his-and-hers bracelets crafted from recycled illegal gun metal and bullet casings.

Created in partnership with Liberty United - a philanthropic jewelry brand which aims to reduce gun violence in the U.S. - each bracelet bears a serial number of an illegal gun it that Liberty United has recycled.

'Gun violence is rampant in the United States, but it doesn't have to be,' reads Liberty United's mission statement.

Turning violence into beauty: Armani Exchange has teamed up with Liberty United to craft a set of bracelets (pictured) for $98.50, made out of seized illegal firearms in the U.S.

The bracelet, which retails for $98.50, is available in men's and women's sizing, and 20per cent of Liberty United's profits from the collection will aid in funding programs aimed at reducing gun violence, according to Armani Exchange.

The ancient Torc twist design symbolizes unity, according to Peter Thum, founder of Liberty United, but also the 'tension' involved in addressing the difficult issue of gun control. The bracelets' unique serial numbers, however, are perhaps their most poignant characteristic.

'In the case of what we do, the serial number is the only thing that's left of that gun, so it's a thread back', Mr Thum says on the collection's promotion video. 'It's like a piece of DNA, and it goes back to the source, but the physical thing where it came from doesn't exist anymore.'

Detail: Each bracelet comes with the original serial number from the gun used to make it, its last remaining element, which appears on the steel end caps

According 
to Pew research, The U.S. has an estimated 283million guns in civilian 
hands, and more than 30,000 people are killed by firearms each year - a 
third of whom are under the age of 20.

Of those deaths, over 10,000 are listed as homicides. In Canada, that 
figure is around 200; in most parts of Europe, it's 150 and in Japan, 
its less than 50 per year.

'We
 focus very specifically on partnering with the police department, who 
give us illegal guns and bullets', says Mr Thum, adding that the bracelets are 
made exclusively in the U.S.

This range is an extension of Liberty 
United's wider collection of rings, bracelets and necklaces. The 
brand has also collaborated with jewelry designers Giles & Brother 
and Pamela Love, on pieces priced between $175 and $1,545.

Roots: Liberty United's mission was born a few years ago in Africa, where founder Peter Thum (pictured) was disturbed by the number of young kids who were armed with assault rifles

Hoards: Mr Thum collected up over 30,000 banned AK47's (pictured) around Africa and melted them down to make jewelery, the profits of which still go towards his aim of reducing gun violence

Liberty United's story began 6 years ago on a trip to Africa, when Mr Thum stumbled across worrying hoards of young children armed with assault rifles.

He started accumulating banned AK47's from around the continent, melting them down, recycling them and turning them into fine jewelry.

'Each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody'

The 
proceeds were churned back into the project of destroying guns - about 
35,000 of them in Africa over the last three years - simultaneously 
making a broader political statement about the problem at hand.

In the words of one of Liberty United's collaborating designers, Philip Crangi: 'Each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody'.
