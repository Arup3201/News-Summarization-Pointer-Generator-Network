Plea: A teary-eyed Monserrate Shirley appeared in court today accused of causing the fatal gas explosion which killed a couple and destroyed 33 homes in Richmond Hill, including her own

Three Indianapolis residents accused of 
causing a gas explosion, which killed a couple and destroyed 33 homes, in
order to fraudulently receive insurance money were held in jail today and could face the death penalty.

Monserrate Shirley, her boyfriend Mark 
Leonard, and his brother, Bob Leonard, were held without bond following a
short court hearing, Abcnews.com reported.

The trio stand accused of causing a 
raging blaze which not only led to irreparable damage of Shirley's home and 
32 others in Richmond Hill but also killed a husband and wife.

They deny the charges and pleaded not-guilty yesterday.

Shirley's neighbours, second-grade 
teacher Jennifer Longworth, 36, and her husband John Dion Longworth, 34,
an electronics expert, were killed on November 10.

Shirley and the Leonard brothers stand accused of their murder, arson and other counts following the incident.

Yesterday a Marion County judge entered not guilty pleas for all three as relatives of the Longworths and owners of the damaged properties watched in court.

John Dion Longworth's aunt, Pam Mosser, a psychiatric nurse, said: "Dion and Jennifer died suffering and screaming".

Court documents claim 47-year-old Shirley was heavily in debt owing $63,000 on credit cards and in bankruptcy proceedings, while her 43-year-old boyfriend is said to have lost thousands in a casino trip three weeks before the blast.

Accused: Mark Leonard, 43, Monserrate Shirley , 47, and his brother, Bob Leonard, 54, are on trial following the explosion. They pleaded not-guilty today and were held in jail without bond

Mark Leonard told the judge he 
couldn't pay for an attorney because all his cash was inside Shirley's 
house when it blew up, leaving him with about $500 in a checking 
account.

The home's original loan was for $116,000 and a second mortgage was taken out on the home for $65,000, the affidavit says.

The judge appointed public defenders for the Leonards. Those attorneys did not return phone calls seeking comment.

Randall Cable, Shirley's attorney, declined comment when reached by phone after the hearing.

'All my money, all of it, it's gone,' he said. 'I had money in the house and it's not there anymore.'

The three accused face two counts of murder as well as 33 counts of arson - one for each of the homes authorities now say are so damaged they must be demolished.

Shirley and Mark Leonard also face two counts of conspiracy to commit arson and Bob Leonard, 54, faces one conspiracy count. These relate to an attempted blast prosecutors claim they tried to carry out a weekend before.

Destroyed: Those who lost their homes in the Richmond Hill blast were in court yesterday to watch the three accused plead not-guilty

Abcnews today reported prosecutor Terry Curry will consider seeking the death penalty in the trial which is scheduled for March 4.

He will argue that the suspects removed a gas fireplace valve and a gas line regulator to fill Monserrate's house with gas. It is alleged that they then used a microwave, set to start on a timer, to spark the explosion.

Mosser

John Dion Longworth's aunt, Pam 
Mosser, a psychiatric nurse who attended the hearing on the back of a 
16-hour shift, said it is important for people to know how her family 
suffered while the suspects apparently gave no thought for their 
neighbors' lives.

'Dion and Jennifer died suffering and
screaming. It is unbelievable to me that someone could be gambling and 
drinking while their house blows up and people are dying,' Mosser told 
reporters after the hearing.

'I cannot forgive that,' she said. 'I think they should die a horrible death,' Mosser said. 'And it's terrible to have these feelings.'

Richmond Hills resident Barry Chipman said neighbours remained fearful of loud noises more than a month after the blast. He said he was driving with his teenage daughter recently when he popped the gum he was chewing and it 'made her jump.'

'Everybody's still jumpy,' he said.
