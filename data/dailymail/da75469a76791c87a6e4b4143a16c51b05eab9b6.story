A woman’s torso found floating in the water near Niagara Falls has launched a murder investigation according to police making the second grim discovery of body parts in Canada’s waterways in recent weeks.

Police estimate the woman’s body had been in the water for up to 10 days before spotted by a tourist near the base of the Falls before traveling near the Rainbow Bridge and removed by police on Wednesday afternoon.

Police said the latest case is not related to body parts found in Toronto earlier in August that are connected to a victim whose torso is still missing.

The murder victims have gotten extra attention because of the case of porn actor Luka Magnotta, who is accused of dismembering a Chinese student in Montreal and mailing his body parts to political parties and a school earlier this year.

Niagara Police Insp. Jim McCaffrey said the woman was a murder victim, but declined to reveal the cause of death. McCaffrey said authorities have asked police in New York and Ontario to review missing-person files.

Police say they are asking for help in identifying the body. A preliminary post-mortem indicated the torso belonged to a white woman between 20 and 40 years old and had a pierced navel and at least one cesarean section scar, the examination indicated.

McCaffrey said it's not uncommon to find body parts in the Niagara River. 'That's pretty fast moving water and it does have an effect on bodies in the water,' he said.

An emergency task unit, marine unit and the Niagara Parks Police high angle river team were being called on to search for the rest of the woman's remains, McCaffery said.

Niagara Police Const. Derek Watson said the search will not be easy.

'Given the unpredictable current and the bodies of water that flow into the Niagara River, it makes it impossible to even know where to start,' Watson said.

Police said the body is not connected to the recent murder of a 41-year-old woman whose body parts were strewn in two different parts of the Toronto area. Her torso is still missing.

Guang Hua Liu head, foot and hands were discovered in a river west of Toronto earlier in mid-August. A few days later, her two calves, a thigh and an arm were found in a creek in eastern Toronto. Her estranged boyfriend, Chun Qi Jiang, 40, was charged with murder last week.
