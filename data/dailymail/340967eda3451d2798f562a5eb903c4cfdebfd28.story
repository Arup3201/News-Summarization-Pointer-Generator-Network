He is on course to become Britain's first ever winner of the Tour de France tomorrow when the final stage of the gruelling three-week race ends on the Champs Elysee in Paris.

But despite Bradley Wiggins' incredible achievements on the streets of France this summer, a Twitter row involving his wife Catherine and the partner of teammate Chris Froome has exposed rumblings of discontent within the Sky Team camp.

In what has been dubbed 'the War of the Wags,' Mr Froome's partner Michelle Cound has Tweeted her disapproval at what she sees as the favourable treatment given to Mr Wiggins at her boyfriend's expense.

The blonde, South African sports photographer is upset that Kenyan rider Mr Froomes has been forced into a support role for his team captain as he continues his quest for glory.

Tensions first arose during stage 11 of the race, when Mr Froome was instructed to hold back so that Mr Wiggins could catch up and retain the leader's yellow jersey.

photographer tweeted: 'Team work is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.'

Mrs Wiggins quickly shot a Tweet back in response which praised other members of the Sky Team Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for 'genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism' -Â  but omitted Mr Froome.

This Tweet led to an immediate response from Ms Cound who replied: 'Don't think there are many

other pro-riders who's partners know more about cycling than Chris's precisely & I know what happened just then.'

'If you want loyalty, get a Froome dog a quality I value although being taken advantage of by others!'

Peta Todd, the partner of Mark 
Cavendish, another of Mr Wiggin's teammates - who won the 18th stage of 
the Tour yesterday - then weighed in to the row, apparently in support 
of Ms Cound.

The tension does not seem to have ruffled Mr Wiggins however, as he takes a lead of two minutes and five seconds  over his competitors into the final stage.

He
has expressed support for Mr Froomes who he said 'will have his day.' 
The 27-year-old rider is highly rated and tipped as a future winner of 
the Tour.

Mr Wiggins, a 32-year-old Londoner, has won three Olympic
gold medals on an indoor track, and is expected to increase that tally 
at the Games next month.

In his autobiography the cyclist has spoken movingly of his troubled relationship with this Australian father, who was also a gifted road racer.
