Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope could be used to find Mars-size alien planets capable of supporting life, it has been claimed.

Researchers at MIT say the telescope could look for small, rocky exoplanets orbiting strange 'failed stars' known as brown dwarfs.

Researchers believe the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life.

Most stars in the cosmos are too weak to even ignite thermonuclear fusion in their cores, thus they never visibly light up.

Instead they emit primarily infrared light, which the Spitzer can easily detect.

Astronomers refer to these 'failed stars' as brown dwarfs.

They also believe some dark matter may consist of dark celestial bodies like brown dwarfs, which do not produce optical light and are too faint to visibly detect from Earth.

'Our program represents an essential 
step towards the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial planets and
carries the compelling promise of studying the concept of habitability 
beyond Earth-like conditions,' the team wrote.

The
team is aiming for Mars-size planets because of their importance in 
planetary formation models, lead author Armaury Triaud told Space.com.

'Eventually these planet embryos, the
size of Mars, those would collide and form bigger rocky planets, or the
core of (gas giant) planets such as Jupiter,' Triaud said.

Brown dwarfs are brighter in the 
infrared – the wavelength in which heat radiates – and those we can see 
are relatively close to Earth, making it easier to detect the effect of 
any planets on their motions.

Spitzer is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space.

Its highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes, including dusty stellar nurseries, the centers of galaxies, and newly forming planetary systems.

Spitzer's infrared eyes also allows astronomers see cooler objects in space, like failed stars (brown dwarfs), extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds, and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets.

Astronomers will seek small planets crossing the face of these brown dwarfs to look for life.

The planets sought would orbit more 
closely than Mercury does to the sun, but the faint warmth of brown 
dwarfs could still make such inner regions habitable, researchers said.

In a brown dwarf's 'habitable zone' it's possible that a planet could pass between the brown dwarf
and Earth more than 50 times a year, providing multiple attempts to study them.

The scheme could also help find 
targets for the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope, which will be 
able to probe planetary atmospheres to look for traces of oxygen.

'Right now, there are no projects 
able to find an Earth-sized planet whose atmosphere can be studied with 
the James Webb,' he said.

The proposal is ne of several being considered to further extend Spitzer's mission.

Spitzer launched in August 2003, and ran out of coolant four years ago but is observing new targets (such as near-Earth objects) as part of an extended mission.
