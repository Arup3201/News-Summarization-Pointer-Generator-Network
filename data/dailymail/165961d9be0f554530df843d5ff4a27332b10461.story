As temperatures soared into the 30s on the third day of the Australian Open in Melbourne, the heat seemed to be taking its toll on players and spectators alike.

During the close match between Maria Sharapova and Alexandra Panova the women draped iced towels around their shoulders and sheltered in the shade between sets.

Sharapova looked flushed as she held the cool towel around her upper body, making sure that she cooled off the back of her neck and face too.

The world number two saved two match points before escaping with a 6-1 4-6 7-5 second-round victory over little-known Russian compatriot Panova.

Panova led 4-1 in the final set and then held a pair of match points in the 10th game, both of which Sharapova saved with clean forehand winners.

Buoyed by that narrow escape, Sharapova steadied to win in two hours and 32 minutes. Panova, 25, had not even won a match at grand slam level until she beat Romania's Sorana Cirstea two days ago. 

Sharapova is now unbeaten in six matches in 2015, having begun the year with victory at the Brisbane International. 

With the mercury rising well above 30 those there to watch the matches were also doing everything they can to avoid the heat of the sun beating down on them.

Many spectators came prepared with green and yellow umbrellas attached to their heads, while others went for the more traditional hand-held accessory.

Some lathered on the sunscreen as they should, while others chose to forgo shirts altogether in a bid to keep their temperatures down.

There were people lined up at the water vapor machines, with many over-heated members of the crowd pausing to taken in the cool spray being sent their way by giant fans.

While there has been no discussion of it so far this year, the Australian Open there is a Extreme Heat Policy which can be put in place when temperatures soar past 35 and the heat stress level reaches 28.

Implemented in 1998, the policy outlines that no new matches can commence for at least an hour after it is enforced.

However any matches in progress must be completed, while breaks between sets can be extended at the discretion of the umpire.

Rod Laver Arena and Vodafone Arena both have roofs which can be closed, but this is not allowed to take place mid-match.

Later on Wednesday Australians Nick Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic, Thanasi Kokkinakis, Sam Groth, James Duckworth and Marinko Matosevic will all take to the court, with at least one Aussie guaranteed to reach the third round given Kokkinakis faces Groth.

It is the first time since 2000 that so many Australians have made it beyond the first round in their home grand slam.

Meanwhile, pundits are speculating that this could be Lleyton's last Rod Laver Arena outing. 

Towels were used when hats and sunglasses weren't enough to keep off the sun
