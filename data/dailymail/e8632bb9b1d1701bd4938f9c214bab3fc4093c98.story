An angry wife who tried to return $1.4 million in goods her then-husband bought from a saleswoman who was allegedly his mistress has settled has settled her lawsuit against Neiman Marcus.

Patricia Walker, an Arkansas heiress living in University Park, Texas, wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband Robert Tennison had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper, Favi Lo, who received a steep commission on the purchases.

The store was unaware of the liaison, according to court documents, and said it had no obligation to accept the goods. The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident.

According to the Dallas News, the case has been settled but court documents relating to the case have been sealed.

The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time.

Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer.

The store called Walker’s claims 'nothing more than the ventings of a 
woman scorned by the infidelity of her former husband that have spilled 
over from her highly contentious divorce.'

Walker filed a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of fraud, deceptive trade practices and a violation of company policies which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame.

The store's returns policy was a weak point in Neiman Marcus' case. Neiman Marcus attorney Walter Herring claimed there was no written policy regarding in-store and catalog returns, saying that the decision was made at individual store manager's discretion.

According to the Dallas News, Judge Ken Molberg asked, 'How does the manager find out about this unwritten policy if it’s not somewhere? Is it just kind of word of mouth?'

'I believe that must be, Your Honor, because they say there is no written policy,' responded Herring.

'Boy,' replied Molberg, 'I find that totally incredible.'

Walker’s lawyer, Mark Ticer, took a printout from the Neiman Marcus website concerning returns that stated: 'You may return for credit, at any time, merchandise with which you are not completely satisfied.'

According to a witness called by Ticer, a Neiman Marcus loss-prevention official, the store had at another time provided a refund for a customer in Atlanta returning a four or five-year-old pair of worn shoes because she 'didn't like them anymore.'

Walker had only learned of the alleged 
affair in 2010, which was just a few months into the couple's divorce. 
She closed her account with the store immediately after she found out.

Ms Walker was a loyal customer; she had spent $100,000 per year at the store up until her accident.

Her husband's total purchases, which are described as 'like new' or in 'mint condition', outweighed her own by hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2007 and 2010.

In 2009, his purchases totaled $850,000. According to FD Luxe, after Walker's car accident, her husband took over much of the running of the household - including her Neiman Marcus account.

Walker, an heiress from Arkansas, married the already thrice-divorced Tennison in 2005. He had had some professional success but Walker was the financier of the marriage.

Ticer told ABC that the gifts, including a pair of earrings worth $30,000 and a pair pf pajamas worth $285, were items that his client 'couldn't wear and never really wanted'.

He said: 'The product of these sales is sex for merchandise.'

The store's return policy states: 'If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your 
timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise.

'Returned 
merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the 
same condition as when it was received. Used merchandise cannot be 
returned unless defective. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply.'

After Ms Walker had requested that the goods be refunded, the store sent staff out to inspect the merchandise.

Mr Ticer said 'the store never followed through or offered an explanation for not taking the items back'.

Location: The Neiman Marcus store in Dallas where Ms Walker's ex-husband purchased the large amount of goods. His mistress, the personal shopper who earned commission on the purchases, still works there

He expressed further disapproval over the company's choice to keep Ms Lo as an employer. She is still employed at the retailer's NorthPark Mall location in Dallas.

He said: 'The real villain in this case is Neiman Marcus. After 
learning of this affair, they decided they weren't going to do anything about 
it.'

According to FD Luxe, Favi Lo, along with three other Neiman Marcus staff members, met with Walker for mediation in April. Together they drafted a four-page, handwritten agreement and canceled the jury trial scheduled for this month.

A formalized version of the document, however, was contested by Walker, who refused to sign it.  According to court papers filed by Neiman Marcus, 'Walker has refused to sign the agreement - a document she last edited and approved — and she has not explained why.'

Walker and Neiman Marcus returned to court on June 20 to settle the case. The transcript and papers related to the case are sealed and neither party will discuss the terms of the deal.
