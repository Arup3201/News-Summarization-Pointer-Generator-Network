The bizzare friendship between the two species has been candidly caught on camera at the Exotic Animal Experience in Orlando. 

In the video, the playful best friends can be seen running around the farm, rubbing each other's bellies and embracing in headlocks.

An adorable video has appeared online showing an Irish Wolfhound puppy playing chase with a kangaroo

The odd couple, four-month-old Irish Wolfhound Keeva and one-year-old kangaroo Love Bug, have formed an unlikely friendship on the farm and can be seen in the video wrestling each other to the ground. 

Love Bug shows her obvious affection for the puppy as she plays with Keeva's head and ears and even attempts to give her a belly rub. 

At one point things appear to be turning nasty as Love Bug stamps on Keeva's head. However it all seems to be in jest as the two hyperactive animals continue to fool around  hitting out at each other.

The young kangaroo seems to be winning the fight at one stage, as Keeva falls to the floor in a slump. 

But the dog isn't going to let the kangaroo get away that easy and as Love Bug jumps off, Keeva is hot on her tail chasing her around the corner where horses are happily enjoying their lunch. 

At one point the loveable pair skip past J.R., another dog on the farm, who seems used to their playful antics.

The video ends with Keeva picking up the pace and chasing love Bug around the corner. 

The Animal Experience in Orlando regularly posts videos to their Facebook pages. 

They have previously uploaded a video of a kangaroo and a lemur playing tag. 

Facebook users were outraged at the video, which appears to show a kangaroo caged up along with a number of other animals in horrific living conditions. 

Many pointed to the fact that the highly active animals are caged together and should have their own space.
