Is it a bird, is it a plane?  No....it’s Jetman!

This was the amazing sight as Spitfire pilot Nigel Lamb teamed up with adventurer Yves ‘Jetman’ Rossy in the skies above Switzerland yesterday.

The intrepid flying man takes to the air using only a jet-powered carbon-fibre wing strapped to his back.

Death-defying formation: 'Jetman' Yves Rossy flew alongside an iconic British Spitfire flown by Nigel Lamb above the Swiss mountains for an airfield's annual 'fly-in'

He teamed up with warplane pilot Mr Lamb for the annual aviation festival at the Bex aerodrome near Geneva.

Mr Lamb, who is part of the Breitling 
Fighters display team, was flying the original wartime Spitfire MH343, 
which is based at the Imperial War Museum aerodrome at Duxford, near 
Cambridge.

In 2006, Mr Rossy, 53, a former Swiss 
Air Force fighter pilot, became the first person to successfully fly 
using just a  jet-powered wing. Since then he has powered across the 
English Channel at 186 mph and flown over the Alps and the Grand Canyon.

He said: ‘To fly in formation with this wonderful machine [the Spitfire] is an incredible experience.

‘Since my technology is getting more 
and more reliable I am very confident about these flights. I can relax 
and enjoy such a fantastic experience. Under my wing I am free. I have 
the perfect view.’

Jet pack: His custom made jet-propelled winged invention allowed him to fly close by the Spitfire

Sky high: Rossy used to fly fighter jets for the Swiss air force but now dons the 121lbs jet suit, completing many astonishing individual flights

Popular plane: The 1943 Spitfire has been a popular part of the annual 'fly-in' at Bex airfield since its first appearance at the event in 1976

It is the latest in a series of 
astonishing stunts mr Rossy, 53, has done in formation having flown 
alongside 1940s’ passenger aircraft Breitling Douglas DC-3 and also with
two L-39c Albatros Jets.

His custom made jet-propelled winged 
invention allowed him to fly beside the Spitfire at high speeds above 
the stunning Swiss mountains.

Operated by the Old Flying Machine Company, the original wartime MH343 is perhaps the most famous of all Spitfires still flying today. It was built in 1943 at Vickers, Castle Bromwich in West Midlands and is completely original and never fully rebuilt.

Rossy flew fighter jets for the Swiss air force for 17 years and since he created his flight suit in 2006 he became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing according to his website.

The suit weighs almost 121lbs and has a wing span of 6ft 6in.

What a view: Rossy said that the technology of his jet suit has become so reliable that when flying he can relax and take in the view

His invention has now been refined, so 'all he has is an altimeter for safety, and a tiny throttle control in his hand'.

Rossy’s
website said he 'has always dedicated all his free time to flight and 
experimented with all its forms', creating a harness with inflatable 
wing panels that he subsequently developed into a rigid wing with four 
engines.

Spitfire pilot Lamb is well known for flying in the Red Bull Air Race World Championships.
