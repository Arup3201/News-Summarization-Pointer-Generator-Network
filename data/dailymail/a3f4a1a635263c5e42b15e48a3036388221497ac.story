The catastrophic storm that tore through Moore, Oklahoma on Monday bears striking similarities to other powerful tornadoes that have killed hundreds of people and caused billions in damage.

Striking on May 3 - 14-years ago - outside Moore, the strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were registered as the massive twister barreled through at 318 mph.

The huge F5 category tornado, which is classified as 'incredible,' caused $1.1billion in damage and in total caused the deaths of 44 people.

Just like Monday's horrifying storm, the 1999 storm system developed at around 3.30pm. and touched down seven miles northeast of Medicine Park at 4.51pm.

Debris: The 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak that struck Moore, Oklahoma was a vigorous severe weather event that lasted from May 3 through 6 of that year

Deadly twister: The 2011 Joplin tornado, pictured, struck with almost the same intensity as Monday's storm in Oklahoma

During the tornado, 8,000 homes were  
damaged or destroyed and it caused $1.1billion in damage (adjusted for 
inflation), making it the most expensive tornado in U.S. history, a 
record since smashed by the 2011 Joplin tornado.

The Joplin twister struck with almost the same intensity as Monday's storm.

Both registered an F5 on the Fujita Scale, meaning they had sustained winds of more than 200 miles per hour.

While a firm number of casualties from Monday's twister is yet to be established, it has the potential to be as deadly as 
the Joplin tornadoes of April 2011, which killed more than 158 people.

The deadliest tornado ever recorded claimed the lives of 695 people on March 18, 1925, in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.

Loss of life: The second deadliest twister struck Tupelo, Mississippi in 1936, killing 216 people

Double trouble: A day after the Tupelo tornado, a second one that was just as deadly hit Gainesville, Georgia, killling 203

Behind it are two tornadoes that struck over two horrific days in April 1936 in Tupelo, Mississippi and Gainesville, Georgia, killing 216 and 203 people, respectively.

The 1999 Moore tornado prompted the National Weather Service to send out the first-ever Tornado Emergency, a severe weather message used only in extreme cases where a massive tornado is about to impact a densely-populated area.

A tornado emergency was issued today before the two mile wide tornado struck the town of Moore.

Because of the staggering wind speed recorded during the 1999 tornado Bridge Creek–Moore tornado, there was speculation that the Fujita Scale of measurement would be modified to include a F6 catergory for winds that exceeded 318 mph.

However, it was decided that the damage caused by an EF5 tornado leaves little room for any higher or more severe category.

The day after the outbreak, then President Bill Clinton issued a federal disaster declaration for Oklahoma and 1,600 people left homeless overnight of May 3 were put into emergency Red Cross shelters.

While there have been no casualty figures just yet today's storms have the potential to be as deadly as the tragic Alabama tornadoes of April 2011 which killed over 158 people in Joplin.

Before that the deadliest day of tornadoes nationwide since 310 people lost their lives on April 3, 1974.

The tri-state tornado remains the deadliest in U.S. history.

It crossed from southeastern Missouri, through southern Illinois and then into southwestern Indiana.

The tornado carried sheets of iron as far as 50miles away and obliterated entire towns and injured more than 2,000 people.

The tornado outbreak over two days caused millions of dollars’ worth of damage across the region.

The Tupelo tornado destroyed more than 200 homes, sweeping many into Gum Pond along with the residents. It killed whole families, including one of 13.

The following day the Gainesville tornado - a double tornado event - emerged. It destroyed the Cooper Pants Factory, killing 70 workers - the highest tornado death toll from a single building in U.S. history. 

The Woodward tornado is the most deadly to ever strike the state of Oklahoma.

It was almost two miles wide and traveled for 100 miles at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour.

More than 100 blocks in Woodward were levelled and over 1,000 homes and businesses destroyed.

The one-mile wide tornado was the third to strike the town of Joplin since 1971.

More than 1,000 people were injured and almost $3billion worth of damage was caused.

Local media reported that more than half of the 158 who died were killed inside their homes.

Most of the people killed were in rural areas.

Many historians believe the death toll was higher than official records state as many the deaths of many African-American may not have been properly recorded.

Both the Amite and Purvis tornadoes were rated as F4 - the second strongest possible - and injured hundreds of people. 

It is the deadliest tornado to strike Michigan and injured more than 800 people.

The Flint tornado, which traveled at speeds of 35mph, is rated as a F5 on the Fujita scale - the strongest possible.

Of the 116 people killed, all but three died on a four-mile stretch of Coldwater Road.

The Waco tornado killed 22 people as it destroyed the packed Dennis Building and a 12 died in cars crushed in the street.

Almost 200 businesses and factories were destroyed, causing $41.2million worth of damage.

The deadly tornado spurred the development of a nationwide severe weather warnings system.

The tornado leveled churches, as well as more than 200 homes and businesses.

Of those killed, 50 people died as they sought shelter in a black Methodist church in Goliad.

The tornado struck on Easter Sunday at about 6pm, with little or no warning.

It was so strong that steel train cars were later found pierced by pieces of debris from destroyed houses.
