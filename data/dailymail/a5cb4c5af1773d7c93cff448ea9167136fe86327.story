A man was struck and killed by a car while apparently tending to an injured rabbit on a two-lane highway, Wyoming Highway Patrol said today.

William Kieren, 79, of Laramie, died on Sunday at a hospital in Fort Collins. The accident occurred about 9pm on Saturday on Wyoming 230, about six miles west of Laramie.

A trooper says Mr Kieren had stopped his
vehicle along the highway and was on or near the center line when he 
was struck by an oncoming vehicle.

The patrol says the rabbit was still alive on the roadway and was eventually put down by a trooper.

According to the Star-Tribune, the driver who hit Mr Kiernen was another Laramie resident, Samantha Brown, 25.

She told officials that she saw Mr Kieren's car parked up and had changed 
lanes to pass it.

Miss Brown didn't see the elderly man in the road until she realized that she had hit something.

The 79-year-old died at the Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, Colorado.

Arrangements for Mr Kieren's funeral are pending with Montgomery-Stryker Funeral Home.
