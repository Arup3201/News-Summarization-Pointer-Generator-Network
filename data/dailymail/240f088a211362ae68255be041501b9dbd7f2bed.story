A man with one eye is locked in a battle with Specsavers over its 'discriminatory' insistence on charging him the same fee as people who need two eyes checked.

Mr Rainsford, who now has a glass eye, lost his right eye when he was 14 after being shot by a fellow pupil with an airgun at Newcastleâ€™s Heaton Manor Comprehensive.

David Rainsford now believes his fees should be slashed as it is unfair he is being charged the same rate as customers with two eyes.

Sight problems: One eyed David Rainsford disputes Specsaver's decision to charge him the same optician fees as people who require two eyes to be checked, saying the same rate is 'discriminatory'

The 44-year-old from Cramlington is locked in a battle with his optician to get the price reduced.

'It is discriminatory really how they charge the same for one eye as two,' said the father-of-two.

Mr Rainsford, who is an operations manager for Scott Sports, decided when he was due a test he would broach the subject of paying half.

The Cramlington Specsavers customer said: 'I have to look after the eye I have left, it is a very personal thing to me and important for the health of my eye that I have it checked properly.'

After approaching head office to see if they would consider a policy change.

He said: 'You cannot get a disease in a 
glass eye, there is nothing they are willing to consider. Back in the 
90s when I lived in Manchester I got consent from Vision Express for 
this discount.

He was told to contact his store, but Mr Rainsford, who lives with wife Helen, was told it was the same price to test one eye as it is for two.

'It is a simple request and it is a very successful business.'

Dr Nigel 
Best for Specsavers said: 'A thorough eye examination can take anywhere 
between 15 minutes and one hour depending on the nature of the symptoms 
the patient displays and the complexity of the problems.'

'In patients with an ocular prosthesis it is important to be comprehensive.'

Mr Rainsford claimed he received a discount for his single eye checks when he was a customer of Vision Express in Manchester in the 90s, but his local Specsavers has refused to budge on the issue

Dr Best added: 'A typical sight test 
will include an examination of the surrounding area as well as the eye 
itself. Without proper care, prostheses can result in eyelid irritation 
which would require a referral to an appropriate specialist.

'In
 patients who have been fitted with a prosthetic eye following a 
condition that caused a removal, there is a risk that the condition can 
often pose a continuing risk to the remaining eye, making regular, 
thorough examinations important.

'At
 Specsavers, patients not entitled to an eye examination funded by the 
NHS can be confident that irrespective of the time required to perform 
such an examination, a single fixed fee will be charged.'
