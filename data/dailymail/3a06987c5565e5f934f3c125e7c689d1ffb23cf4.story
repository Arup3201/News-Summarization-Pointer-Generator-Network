A dog who vanished from his Texas yard last year has been returned home after turning up in a central Indiana city 1,100 miles away.

Blue, a brown pit bull with a white spot on his chest, was reunited with JoeAnn Navarro of Galveston eight months after last seeing his owner.

Mrs Navarro, 69, said her two pit bulls, Blue and Maggie, were stolen from her backyard in May, the Galveston Daily News reported.

Mrs Navarro thought she'd never see either dog again, but the Kokomo Humane Society called her a week ago to say a stranger had dropped her year-old Blue off at its shelter about 40 miles north of Indianapolis.

A microchip implanted in Blue, who was just a few weeks old when he disappeared, wasn't registered, but the Indiana organization was able to find out that it had come from Texas and find Mrs Navarro.

However the dog-lover didn't have enough money to make the journey up to the Hoosier State, which is 34 hours roundtrip.

Three men, including two retired Galveston County sheriff's deputies Ricky Mitchell and Bobby Stanton, read about Mrs Navarro's story in their local newspaper and volunteered to drive to Indiana last week.

The team, which included Mr Mitchell's brother Bill Russell, gathered Blue's leash and bed  and headed out last week. The men brought Blue back to Texas on Saturday after stopping in Kentucky because of a snowstorm.

The grateful owner burst into tears when she was reunited with her long-lost canine, which jumped out of Mr Mitchell's pickup truck.

Children with welcome back signs stood outside the Galveston Humane Society alongside Mrs Navarro, who arrived at the center two hours before her dog arrived. 

'I don't have the words to describe what I am feeling,' she said. 'It is just a miracle. I prayed and prayed and I guess my prayers have been answered.'

The journey from Galveston, Texas, to Kokomo, Indiana, is 1,100 miles, which amounts to a 34-hour round trip car ride

More than 150 people got in contact with the Galveston Daily News to try and help Mrs Navarro reunite with Blue

Mr Mitchell said he plans on staying in contact with the dog and its owner.
