The BBC has spent more than £2million transporting staff and guests between London, Manchester and Salford in the past two years, it has been revealed.

The broadcaster paid for at least 24,000 train journeys and more than 500 flights between the capital and its base in the North West.

This is despite the corporation promising to employ more people who live near to its new MediaCity base in Salford.

Expensive move: The broadcaster paid for more than 24,000 train journeys and more than 500 flights between the capital and its new MediaCity home in Salford

It spent more than £1.84m of taxpayers' money on trains and nearly £77,000 on flights.

The corporation has shifted thousands 
of staff to its northern headquarters since last May as part of its relocation to the North West, with many temporarily
working from two different sites.

The bill for rail journeys increased by nearly 30 per cent between 2009-10 and 2010-11, according to figures released under Freedom of Information act and seen by the Daily Telegraph.

And they would have been even higher if figures included journeys paid for by individual staff and claimed back through the BBC’s expenses system.

In a separate FoI based on the period from May to December last year, spending averaged more than £100,000 a month. More than £640,000 was spent on rail journeys from London to Manchester, more than £45,000 on flights to Manchester and more than £160,000 on taxis.

Trips included a £1,502 flight from Dubai and more than 50 three-figure taxi bills - including one for £653.

Other journeys included £458.20 on air travel from Milan and a £712 flight to party hotspot Ibiza.

The corporation now regularly publishes expenses claims by senior members of staff. Three years ago, it was slated over extravagant spending, including a £2,000 bill for director-general Mark Thompson to fly back early from a holiday in Italy.

In January it emerged that BBC North director Peter Salmon had spent £1,115 on journeys between London and Manchester between April and June last year.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We are a major broadcasting organisation with production bases across the UK and a news operation that covers a constantly changing global news agenda, so some element of travel is inevitable.

'However, we are mindful that we spend public money and we work hard to keep this expenditure to a minimum. 

Long commute: BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid and Bill Turnbull 
are now working from Salford and are entitled to a full relocation 
package if they move

'Some of these costs will be bookings for multiple passengers as the information provided from our booking system does not detail the number of tickets purchased on each booking.'

BBC employees are required to take trains within mainline Britain unless there are time constraints or flights are significantly cheaper, according to its expenses policy.

Staff can use shuttle buses to travel between BBC sites and late night and early morning journeys to work - between 10.45pm and 6.30am - will also be paid for by the BBC where staff are travelling from within a 40-mile radius.

They will also meet excess costs of travel if workers are temporarily based somewhere other than their normal place of work - for example a London-based employee working from Salford.

The National Audit Office will carry out a 'value for money' review of the move to Salford Quays later this year.

Spending on travel from London to the North East

BBC Breakfast welcomed viewers to its new home in Salford today, with its usual presenters Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid hosting the show from the northern city for the first time.

Mr Turnbull previewed a news item on one in four people reportedly not knowing their neighbours by saying friends can now be made in other ways.

Ms Reid continued: 'Talking of making new friends, we are very glad you have joined us for our first morning from our new studio in Salford.'

Dr David Holmes, a psychologist at 
Manchester Metropolitan University, talked about the survey, while 
actress Connie Fisher - currently starring in the musical Wonderful Town
 at the nearby Lowry Theatre - was also due on the show.

Manchester-based human rights lawyer Pete Weatherby QC appeared to discuss the possible extradition of radical preacher Abu Hamza.

The corporation's flagship morning programme will be fronted by Mr Ms Turnbull, Reid, Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt, following the departures of presenter Sian Williams and sports presenter Chris Hollins.

As permanent members of staff, Ms Reid and Mr Turnbull are entitled to a full relocation package should they choose to reside in Manchester, but Ms Minchin and Mr Stayt are freelance employees, so any move would be at their own expense.

Forty-six percent of BBC Breakfast staff have relocated to Salford, but the BBC could neither confirm nor deny last night that Ms Reid would commute daily from London as has been reported.

The team join around 2,200 BBC staff who have moved to Salford during the £1.5billion move, including employees from BBC Sport and BBC Children, Radio 6 Music, Radio 5 Live and North West Tonight.
