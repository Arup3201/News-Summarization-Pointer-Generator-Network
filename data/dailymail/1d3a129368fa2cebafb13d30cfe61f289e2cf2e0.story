Chancellor George Osborne, who was out running in Westminster yesterday, could make an announcement on freezing benefits in December

Benefits are set to be frozen in the Government’s drive to save billions more from the welfare budget.

Government sources confirmed that the drastic move, which has previously been fiercely resisted by the Liberal Democrats, is being considered and could be announced by George Osborne in December.

Ministers are also examining the idea of ending the annual inflation-linked rise in benefits, though this would require legislation and is a longer-term prospect.

In recent years, inflation has risen at a far higher rate than average earnings, prompting growing controversy over annual increases in benefit rates.

Whitehall officials say £14billion could have been saved since 2009 if the increase had been pegged to earnings.

‘Earnings have not been rising and people working in both the public and private sectors have had to accept pay freezes,’ said one Government source. ‘Yet benefits have been rising. It should be addressed.’

In February, MPs agreed that the jobless would see their benefits rise by 5.2 per cent to protect them against ‘cost of living increases’.

The overall rise in welfare payments, which will cost taxpayers £6.6billion in the current financial year, was more than double the average pay increase of around 2.1 per cent which those in work can expect.

Tory MPs argued that the fact that 
those on benefits will see their income increase more than those in work
 made it harder for ministers to argue that they are making work pay.

The
 Chancellor is now seeking up to £10billion in extra savings from the 
welfare budget, but any move to freeze benefits will strain coalition 
relations and anger charities representing vulnerable groups.

The state pension would be unaffected, since the Coalition has introduced a ‘triple lock’, which means it will rise annually in line with either inflation, earnings, or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is the highest figure.

But it would be politically difficult to announce a blanket freeze on all disability benefits. Government sources suggested, however, that the Lib Dems have shifted on the issue and are ready to consider the move.

They are likely to try to insist that David Cameron reconsiders his refusal to consider means-testing some universal benefits, such as winter fuel payments and free bus passes for all – an argument being backed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

Downing Street failed to issue a denial on the suggestion that ministers are looking at a freeze and then an end to the link with inflation.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the decision on whether to increase benefit payments in line with inflation was made on an annual basis, usually in December, for the following year.

‘On some occasions thresholds are frozen or entitlements frozen,’ he said. Paul Jenkins, the chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: ‘This will come as yet another blow for many vulnerable people who are already struggling and who feel they are being unfairly targeted by cuts to the benefits system.

‘People with serious mental illnesses are being attacked from all sides as cuts to social care, the NHS and benefits all begin to bite at once.

‘People with illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, who are unable to work, deserve to be properly supported.

‘We urge the Government to consider how freezing benefits will affect the most vulnerable people in society, and to think again before making these changes.’
