Carlo Ancelotti has told Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United to forget about signing Sami Khedira.

The German World Cup star has only just returned to training with Real Madrid after being given an extended holiday following his country’s success in Brazil.

But Ancelotti has no intention of allowing Khedira, who started the Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in May, to leave.

The Real Madrid coach said: ‘He’s not leaving, he’s a Real Madrid player. He has a contract until June 30, 2015 and that’s all there is to say.'

Khedira has been heavily linked with a £24million move to the Emirates but it is understood his £150,000 a week wages could move problematic for Arsenal.

Khedira's fellow German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil - who swapped Real for Arsenal last summer - is the top earner on £140,000.

The 27-year-old has also been linked with a reunion with his former manager Jose Mourinho at Chelsea after Real - who are preparing to face Sevilla in the European Super Cup on Tuesday - signed Toni Kroos for £24m earlier this summer.

Khedira has one year left on his contract at Real and reports have suggested that he has turned the club's latest contract offer. 

If Real fail to agree a new deal with him then they risk losing him on a free transfer next summer.
