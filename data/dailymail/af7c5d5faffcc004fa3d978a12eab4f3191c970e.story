He did not say who will be receiving the donation.

Brees says he and his wife want to give back what's been given to them.

Their donation is equal to the amount pledged by the NFL and NFL Players Association, which was announced on November 1 in a joint press conference between league commissioner Roger Goodell and  NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith.

They say their foundation will also be donating $2million to various New Orleans organizations over the next several months.

On Sunday, President Bill Clinton visited the Rockaways as a part of his Day of Action campaign.

The former president met with area residents who suffered catastrophic damage to their homes and toured the devastation.

The Dream Foundation has donated millions in charitable donations since its inception in 2003.

Among its beneficiaries are the American Cancer Society, the GW Carver School of Dreams and the Second Harvest Food Bank.

On the football field on Sunday, Brees led the Saints to a win over the Oakland Raiders.

Brees threw three touchdown passes and Malcolm Jenkins returned an interception for another score to get the Saints back to .500 with a 38-17 victory.
