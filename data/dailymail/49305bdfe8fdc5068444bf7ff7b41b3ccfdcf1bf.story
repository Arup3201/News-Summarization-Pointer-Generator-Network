Murdered police officer Bryson Anderson’s family honours the man who was a much-loved husband and father of three.

After many months of denial, Fiona Barbieri, 47, and her 21-year-old son Mitchell cried and hugged in the dock as they prepared to plea to their roles in the death of Detective Inspector Anderson on December 6, 2012 as they were due to stand trial at the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Almost two years after he was stabbed to death in the neighbourhood dispute, Bryson’s widow Donna Anderson and their three children Olivia, Darcy and Cain could not wipe the smiles off their faces when they told fond stories of how Bryson was always the larrikin of the family.

Mitchell pleaded guilty to the officer's murder, while his mother pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of substantial impairment.

The 21-year-old now faces a mandatory life sentence for murdering a police officer in the course of his duty.

Justice has been served for the family of slain police officer Anderson, but the emotional scars still remain for them and will do for some time to come. 

Donna spoke to Channel Nine's ACA about the two very different sides to her husband who was stabbed to death after attending a neighbourhood dispute in Oakville in north west Sydney.

‘There was the policeman side to him which was incredibly serious – he took his job very seriously -but there was the family side of him where he was just the clown in every family gathering,’ she said.

Bryson's family described him as a joker who had a great sense of humour

Olivia, Cain and Darcy could not speak highly enough of their deceased father

Despite working in a stressful and demanding job in the police force for 26 years, Bryson always had the time for his children.

‘He just absolutely adored his kids,’ she said. 

‘He was a typical dad - he loved dad jokes and if he could embarrass the kids in front of their friends that was even better.’

His three children could not speak highly enough of their father.

‘He would totally just love life - it was awesome,’ his only daughter Olivia said. ‘Yes, he liked to embarrass us.’

His eldest son, Darcy said he was a great dad who was always a joker.

‘He photo bombed a lot – my first cricket game in my photo – he was in the background,’ he said.

‘Cricket is my life – me and dad built the pitch out the front in 2003 I think.’

‘We got tonnes of dirt and just rolled it and got it all padded down and I just keep mowing it in.’

'He was always a joker – he photo-bombed a lot,' his youngest son Cain said. 

While being dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to squeeze in volunteering with the Special Olympics, travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to children and also volunteering as a firefighter.

‘He would come home from the police sometimes he would only be there for an hours or so and then the bells would go off and he would go out to a fire call and he did that for nine years,’ Donna said.

But reminiscing on old funny stories will never take away the pain of losing their beloved father.

Detective Inspector Anderson's family said his killers' guilty pleas have brought them closer to the formal conclusion of the case.

But privately they continue to struggle with their loss, and it will be some time before they finally come to terms with the tragedy.

Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector Anderson's brother, Warwick, was flanked by police officers.

'Today we are relieved that the events have brought us closer to a resolution of the public phase of this matter,' he said.

'Privately there is still a significant way to go for our family as we try to come to terms with the senseless and tragic loss of Bryson.'

He said his family's 'thoughts, care and prayers' were with the colleagues who continued to suffer physical and psychological injuries as a result of his brother's death.

While dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to volunteer with the Special Olympics

Bryson also loved travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to the local children

During the committal hearing last year, a number of police officers broke down as they recalled the murder.

The court heard the officers were called to the Barbieris' Oakville property in Sydney's west following reports of a neighbourhood dispute.

Detective Inspector Anderson was killed while trying to calm the dispute. 

Police were called to the property after neighbours complained about arrows being fired into their yard from a cross-bow. 

Over the next two hours, 11 police who attended the scene were forced to take refuge behind a cordon as they fought off abuse, arrows, angry dogs and other weapons while trying to bring the situation to a peaceful resolution. 

Detective Inspector Anderson, 45, died after he was attacked and stabbed during the stand-off that ensued. 

At officer Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was greatly admired by his fellow officers

Anderson always showed 'initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance'

Constable Hannah Watson said she remembered seeing Mitchell Barbieri strike officer Anderson but thought the senior officer had just been punched.

Constable Ryan Mitchell told the court last year: 'When I saw there was a significant amount of blood on my colleagues, I knew what had happened was very serious.'

At Detective Inspector Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was admired by his fellow officers for his tenacity and determination, as well as his empathy and compassion.

'He showed initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance; dedication and humility; and, memorably, a ready smile and an engaging way.

'Bryson drew people to him, without guile and without effort.'

The Barbieris will return to court on November 12.
