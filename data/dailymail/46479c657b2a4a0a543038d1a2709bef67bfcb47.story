A transsexual former inmate of Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada who claims to have had a sexual fling with O.J. Simpson while in prison has revealed she is HIV positive and may have infected the disgraced football great.

Former prostitute Jazmena Jameson has described in detail the alleged one-off encounter she shared with 67-year-old Simpson while serving time in 2013.

In a new interview with Radar Online, Jameson said she got to know the former NFL star - who has been in Lovelock since 2008 following a bungled Las Vegas robbery - while working as the lead porter for the laundry room and would deliver clothes to his cell every other day.

Describing herself as exceedingly flirtatious and the 'closest thing to a woman' in the prison, Jameson said she and Simspon would often 'joke around and stuff'.

'Flirtatious': Jameson, a former transsexual prostitute, says she would openly flirt with Simpson while delivering his laundry, and that their relationship advanced when she exposed her breasts to him

'Finally one day he said, ''You have big t---ies. Are those implants or the hormone shots?'',' Jameson told Radar.

'And he wanted to see them - I don't mind showing anyone, you know, so I ended up showing them to him.

'He said, ''You better get up out of here!''.'

Nothing happened between them that day, Jameson maintained.

However when she was back in the cell about a month later, Jameson claimed she started to dance for Simpson, before making an advance.

'I walked up on him and said, ''You can stop me if you want to'',' she said.

'I knew he wasn't going to stop me.

'I ended up having oral sex with him.'

Jameson told Radar that Simpson ejaculated on his own stomach.

She also told the website that she is HIV positive. 

Scene: O.J. Simpson is currently serving 33 years - with a non-parole period of nine years - in the treeless Lovelock Correctional Facility in the Nevada desert 

There is little data that exists that calculates the risk of contracting HIV from giving or receiving oral sex.

However, according to HIV resource The Body Pro, a review published in 2008 and concluded that vaginal and penile oral sex pose a 'low but non-zero transmission probability'.

The alleged relationship between Jameson and Simpson was outed earlier this week by The National Inquirer.

Radar Online were then able to secure an interview with her.

Earlier this week it was revealed that American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy will be doing a TV mini-series based on the O.J. Simpson.

American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson will be based on Jeffrey Toobin's book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson, according to Entertainment Weekly.

The 10-episode series will look at the Simpson trial from the viewpoint of the lawyers. 

TV pundits are now buzzing with who might portray Simpson.

Simpson will be eligible for parole in 2017. 

In 2008 he was sentenced to 33 years prison with a non-parole period of nine years.

The case involved a Las Vegas hotel room confrontation over sports memorabilia in 2007.

Simpson said the items had been stolen from him and he had been trying to recover them.

However a jury found him guilty of 12 charges, including armed robbery and kidnapping.

In 1995 a Los Angeles jury controversially acquitted him of killing the 1994 murder of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.
