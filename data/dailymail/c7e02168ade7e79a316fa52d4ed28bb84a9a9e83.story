At first glance it might look as if these gentlemen have found an ingenious way of cleaning chimneys.

But in fact they are involved in the 26th Gamsbart Olympics today, pictured standing in front of the Karwendel Mountains near Mittenwald in southern Germany.

The Gamsbart - which translates as ‘chamois beard’ and was originally a deer hunting trophy - is a tuft of hair worn as decoration in the alpine regions of Austria and Germany on Trachten hats.

A chamois is a European mountain goat, and the tuft plume is made by enclosing the lower end of the tuft in a setting of metal or horn that allows the upper end to spread in a brush-like fashion.

A large Gamsbart is made up of 35,000 to 40,000 individual lower neck hairs from several chamois, which are selected in winter. It can take up to two weeks to be created, costing around £1,600.

The size and diameter of the Gamsbart are important signs of the wearer's pride. Participants of the Gamsbart Olympics came from the alpine regions of Bavaria, Austria, Italy, Slovenia and South Tyrol.

A Gamsbart is sometimes also sold after being made from the hair of badgers or deers.
