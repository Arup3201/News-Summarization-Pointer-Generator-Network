Matt Lauer has spoken out about Ann Curry's rocky departure from the Today Show saying that he purposefully tried to keep quiet in the aftermath even though many saw him as the reason for her departure.

The anchor said that while he was 'disappointed' by the way the ousting of Curry was handled publicly, he knew that there was nothing he could do.

'Does anyone want to see a person who’s making the money that the newspapers say I’m making complaining, “Woe is me, my life is terrible, and people are being unfair”? No one would’ve had any patience for that. I wouldn’t have any patience for that,' he told Esquire magazine.

Tense: Matt Lauer said that he was 'incredibly frustrated' over the past two years since he was largely blamed for the forced departure of his co-anchor Ann Curry

That was the only time he mentioned the anchoring upheaval specifically, though there were two other very clear digs at his former colleague.

In one, he said that if he were to offer up-and-coming broadcasters his career, they would all take it in a heartbeat. The interesting part of the anecdote came in the way that he described the offer, and in turn, his time at NBC.

He told the hypothetical newcomers: 'You’re going to have twenty years as host of the Today show, and eighteen of those years are going to be so unbelievably fantastic that you’re going to think you’re living in a fantasy world. And one or two of those years is going to be incredibly frustrating and challenging'.

There was no mention of his current co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, but he did circle back to Katie Couric, who was at the couch beside him in the 1990s through to 2006.

The replacement: Savannah Guthrie came in to take over for Curry in June 2011

Connection: Lauer said that his relationship with Katie Couric was more than just 'chemistry', it was a bond that came from covering stories like the attacks of September 11, 2001

'There’s a difference between good chemistry and a bond. Chemistry is something you have with somebody you meet — or you don’t. It’s an intangible. It may be superficial. It’s much harder to put your finger on than a bond. Broadcasting through 9/11 together, like Katie Couric and I did, creates a bond,' he said.

The interview, which came more in the form of a series of espoused wisdom than an article, included the 55-year-old's reflections on his father and mother, but most saccharine moment came when he spoke about his children.

'If I feel like I’ve done a great job during an interview with the president of the United States live in the Oval Office, it doesn’t give me a tenth of the good feeling of going to the school play and making eye contact with my kids as they’re onstage delivering their lines. Nothing compares with that moment of connection,' he said.

Doting: Lauer said that no interview is as good as a shared connection with his children- seen holding his daughter Romy's hand (he also has two sons named Jack and Thijs who are not pictured)

Ever since Ann Curry made her weepy departure from the Today Show in June 2011, and Lauer has tried to remain tight-lipped throughout it all.

He gave one interview to New York magazine in March where he said that he had not spoken to Curry since his departure because his mind was elsewhere.

'Because I’m concentrating on doing the show, not concentrating on spinning the damage and trying to end the negativity on a daily basis,' he told the magazine.
