One Direction’s Harry Styles has hit out at bandmates Louis
Tomlinson and Zayn Malik for their ‘reckless and stupid’ behaviour after MailOnline's exclusive footage of them smoking a ‘joint’.

Harry is said to be annoyed with them for potentially
jeopardising the band’s upcoming 39-date United States tour after the film showed them sharing a suspicious roll-up in Peru last month.

Louis, 22, and Zayn, 21, who did not mention the indiscretion during a sell-out concert in Sunderland last night, could be banned from the
United States by immigration authorities.

It has also emerged Harry has chosen to fly in a different private jet to Zayn because he does not like his smoking, a source said.

An insider told The Sun: ‘Harry is annoyed about the whole
debacle,' and revealed how the singer thought it was ‘stupid and
reckless’ of the pair to film their actions on camera.

Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band

Bandmembers Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson last night as they joined the rest of the group for a gig in Sunderland, but parents outside admitted their clean-cut image was now tarnished

Flying solo: Separate jets for Harry and his increasingly estranged bandmates this month. Does it mean that some members of the boy band can't stand each other?

The source also revealed how, despite
his reputation, Harry, 20, is in fact ‘professional and mature’ and does not approve of
such antics which he fears could now overshadow the band's success.

‘This should be one of the biggest weeks of the band’s
career with the launch of their UK stadium tour. Instead it has been taken over
by this controversy,' the insider added.

It comes as Louis’ father said he was ‘worried’ for his son
after watching the footage - which was filmed on April 27 as the pair were escorted
by car to a show at the Estadio Nacional in Lima, Peru, where they performed to
a 40,000-strong crowd.

Troy Austin, 45, said his son – who is a keen footballer who
once made an appearance for Doncaster Rovers – had previously vowed to never
touch drugs or get a tattoo.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘It seems the fame
and money have changed him. He’s a different person to that person three years
ago.

‘I do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll
on them. They need a serious talking to.’

'Joint
 lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up 
cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last
 month

Hit
 maker: Zayn takes a draw on the roll up. Before they began their 
journey someone can be heard asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband 
in this?'

Warm up: Louis can be heard joking that 'Mary J' is 'one
 very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up'

Happy daze: At one point during the video, Louis asks: 'How is it Zayn?' Pausing a beat before he exhales Zayn replies: 'Nice'. Zayn blows smoke at the camera and says: 'I know you like dat, bro'

Controversial: In
 MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting
 on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s 
green only, Nig.’

He also questioned One Direction’s management – which
includes their ultimate boss Simon Cowell – by saying they ‘should be
protecting’ the boys from ‘things like this’.

Cowell has been dragged into the row by fans who have bombarded him with messages urging him to take action.

As well as apparently smoking a ‘joint’ in the video, Louis has also been lambasted by fans and critics for using the word 'nig' - which fans say is a shortened version of the N-word.

In the video, Louis puts on an accent while speaking about drugs, then says: ‘It’s green only, nig.’

One
 Direction fans - as well as MPs and racism campaigners – have demanded 
apologies from the band in light of the video.

They suggested the boy 
band had abused their position as role models and risked encouraging 
their young fans to copy them.

Harry Styles arrived at Newcastle International Airport on a separate private jet to Louis and Zayn ahead of One Direction's performance in Sunderland yesterday

Liam Payne (left) and Niall Horan (right) arrived into Newcastle on the same £18million private jet as bandmate Harry Styles but the other members of the group, scandal-hit Louis and Zayn, boarded a different jet

But as the band played to a sell-out 52,000-strong crowd at Sunderland football club’s Stadium of Light ground last night, there was no mention of the recent controversy - let alone an apology.

The only reference made to the scandal was by Liam Payne, who joked about his skinny jeans then, in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd, added: ‘No more media attention, please.’

It is not known how the other bandmates - Liam and Niall Horan, both 20 - feel about Louis and Zayn’s video but it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band.

It is understood Harry and Niall already 
take separate ‘non-smoking’ private jets to the other members and last 
night the pair, joined by Liam, flew into Newcastle on a £18million 
private jet separate from their scandal-hit bandmates.

Upset: Some One Direction fans have said they have destroyed or sold tickets because they are angry about the video

Despite the controversy, thousands of fans turned out in Sunderland tonight to watch the band perform at the Stadium of Light

Parents Julie and Alan Huntington, from Peterlee, County Durham, whose daughter, Jessica, 14, was going to the gig with a friend, said they were concerned by the footage.

Mrs Huntington, 45, a customer service adviser, said: 'They look up to the band so when they see the boys doing this it is worrying.'

Mr Huntington, 41, an electrician, said: 'As parents we are always trying to tell our children that taking drugs is wrong and then you have the band they look up to taking drugs themselves. You're constantly fighting a losing battle.'

Lisa Loftus, 31, a teaching assistant from Seaham, Country Durham, who was taking daughter Aimee, 13, and her friend Sarah Harrison, 13, to the show, said: 'Our children look up to the band and by doing what they have done they are telling them it is ok to behave like that. When they have such young fans it is worrying. They should be showing their fans how to act as children are very influential.'

Michelle Anderson, 46, and her daughter Chloe, 12, from Newcastle, were also attending the gig. Mrs Anderson said: 'My daughter is 12 and she has her own mind so I know she wouldn't be influenced, but other younger children easily could be. If you are that way inclined and don't have parents telling you what is right and wrong then they think it is cool and could do it themselves.'

Laura Baker, 16, from South Shields, who was going to the gig with her friends, said: 'It is a bad example on younger fans but we are older so we know what is right and wrong.'

Harry was also spotted getting on a different plane at the weekend as One Direction travelled from Ireland following a gig.

News of a potential rift in the band will upset fans who have been divided since the footage emerged.

Some fans and their parents turned on the band in light of the controversy which several 'Directioners' ripping up, burning or selling their tickets for the upcoming gigs in the UK, Europe and America.

But others have said they 'still love' the band and accused critics of not being 'true fans'.
