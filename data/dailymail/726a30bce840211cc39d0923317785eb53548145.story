Colombia will wait until the last minute to decide whether to pick recuperating Falcao in their final World Cup squad, coach Jose Pekerman said on Saturday.

'I'll wait until the last day, until the last hour, the last minute, to give out my list of 23,' Pekerman said when he arrived in Buenos Aires with his squad.

Pekerman must name his final 23-man squad by June 2 for the tournament in Brazil starting 10 days later in which Colombia face Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan in Group C.
