To the untrained eye they look just as they are, a row of old garages ideal for storage space.

But to those experienced in playing the property market and investing in hidden gems, the innocuous buildings were too tempting to resist.

The six garages, in Parsons Green, London have sold for a staggering £700,000 - ten times their value, after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer.

The properties were sold by Auction House London, who had valued the row at £75,000.

This row of six garages in Parsons Green, Fulham in London has sold for £700,000 - ten times their £75,000 value

The garages, which each have a rental potential of £65 a month, were sold without planning permission for development.

But that did not deter interest, with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded 'a first'.

The anonymous buyer, who is understood to be a developer, secured the garages for £700,000 - four times the average English house price, and one-and-a-half times the value of a typical London property.

They will now have to submit proposals to planning chiefs at Hammersmith and Fulham council.

Auctioneer Andrew Binstock said: 'We price things very well and we're used to seeing £400,000 houses selling for a £100,000 premium but we're having to recalculate values.

'They had a guide price of £75,000 and ended up selling for £700,000. I've never seen anything like this before. It is a first.

'The garages were owned by a couple who inherited and they couldn't believe it, they were pleasantly surprised.'

The garages, which are off Fulham Road - where average property prices are around £615,000 - were sold to an anonymous buyer who is understood to be a developer. The properties came without planning permission

The sellers, who inherited the garages and had been renting them out, are understood to have carried out a feasibility study with a view to building two, two-bedroom townhouses on the site

Prior to the sale, the owners were renting three of the garages out for £65, £80 and £85 per month.

If they were to carry on renting at these rates, it would take more than 250 years to make £700,000 from them.

The auction house advertised the freehold terrace of garages as 'suitable for redevelopment subject to planning permission'.

It is understood the sellers had conducted a feasibility scheme to redevelop the site with a likely workable scheme of two, two bedroom townhouses.

Two-bedroom flats and houses in Parsons Green can reach between £550,000 to more than £1million, depending on the size of the property.

Property valuation site Zoopla estimates the average property price in the area, just off Fulham Road, is £615,714 - up nearly £60,000 in the last year.

Mr Binstock added: 'It was quite unusual and a very fun part of the auction. It is a prime part of Fulham, but it's also a gamble.

'The garages are clearly not worth £700,000 as they are so the buyer has obviously got a plan for it and it will be interesting to see what it is.

'It is a perfect storm of shortage of stock and strong market forces. It is an unpredictable market, but it is great for sellers.'
