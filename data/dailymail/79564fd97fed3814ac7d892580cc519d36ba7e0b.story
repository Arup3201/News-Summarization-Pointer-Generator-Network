Bob Godfrey, the legendary animator behind the classic children’s cartoons Roobarb & Custard and Henry’s Cat, has died aged 91, his family confirmed today.

Australian-born Mr Godfrey, who enjoyed a five-decade career, won three Baftas for his work as well as an Oscar for his short film Great, which looked at the life of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Cat and dog cartoon Roobarb was narrated by Richard Briers, who died on Sunday aged 79, and it became well-known for its catchy theme tune and cult animation.

Respected: Animator Bob Godfrey who helped create cartoon hits Roobarb and Henry's Cat has died aged 91

Mr Godfrey started his working life as a graphic artist before joining a creative studio and going into cartoon making. His last work was Millennium: The Musical for Channel 4 in 1999.

The animator, who was educated in east London, revealed in 2001 that he had one regret, saying: 'I'd love to have done a full-length feature but I can't seem to stretch myself to that length.

'When you look at my films, they appear 
to be a series of 30-second commercials cut together,' he told the 
Guardian. 'I'm a short distance man whether I like it or not.'

Aardman Animations studio founder Peter Lord said on Twitter: 'Dear old Bob Godfrey is no more. A great influence and inspiration to me and my generation of animators. Also a lovely bloke.'

Hertfordshire-based animator Will Brenton, creator of the Tweenies, said: 'Bob Godfrey has died, aged 91. Strange that the creator and voice of Roobarb leave us in the same week.'

And illustrator An Vrombaut, of London, who is behind the cartoon 64 Zoo Lane, added: 'Very sad to hear that Bob Godfrey, animation legend and all round lovely person, has passed away.'
