The descendants of a Jewish family who owned a chain of department stores in Germany that were seized by the Nazis have been awarded £40 million in compensation.

A Berlin court ordered that the payment should be made to the Schocken family, whose shops were lost during the so-called 'Aryanisation' of businesses in 1938.

The family was already paid almost £12 million in compensation in the 1990s for one of the buildings that was seized, but say other property their family owned was undervalued.

And the court ordered that the heirs to the business, who live in Israel and the United States should receive the additional cash.

The Schocken chain of department stores were founded by brothers Simon and Salman Schocken in the early 1900s with their first outlet in Leipzig.

Their business then went on to open 20 stores, mainly in the Saxony area of Germany.

Salman Schocken became the sole owner of the family firm when his brother Simon died in a car crash in 1929.

During the rise of the Nazis, Mr Schocken was politically forced to sell his department stores during the Aryanisation of German business.

At this time, the Nazis forced non-Aryans, which were mainly Jews to surrender or sell their interests in Nazi Germany business life in a bid to deprive them of their wealth.

Schocken's best known building in the eastern city of Chemnitz was designed by the architect Erich Mendelsohn and now houses the State Museum of Archaeology.

The family started to pursue their claim for compensation in 1994, meaning it took 20 years for them to be awarded full compensation.

Family lawyer Bernd Wilhelm Schmitz told Bloomberg his clients were delighted with the ruling.

He said: 'You find us very happy to finally have the Jewish victims compensated after almost a quarter of a century of legal battles.

'This hasn’t been a case like any other, moving us very much on a personal level as well.'

A spokeswoman for the German Finance Ministry said they would be reviewing the written judgement on the case when it is released before deciding whether they should appeal.
