He's better known to millions of viewers as the mild-mannered vicar Adam Smallbone who arrives in a tough inner-city parish from a sleepy backwater in the hit comedy Rev.

But now actor Tom Hollander is set to ditch his dog collar to play hell-raising, womanising poet Dylan Thomas in a new drama charting the weeks of drink-fuelled excess leading up to his death.

Hollander, 45, will appear opposite former Shameless star Anne-Marie Duff, who plays his fiery wife Caitli, in A Poet In New York. The 75-minute drama will be screened on BBC2 next year to mark the centenary of the poet’s birth.

Written by Andrew Davies, who adapted Bleak House and Pride And Prejudice for TV, A Poet In New York will focus on Thomas’s final weeks in 1953 when he was living a rock star-style existence while on a reading tour of the United States.

Davies said: ‘He was like a rock god in America and attracted huge audiences for his readings. There were lots of groupies and he loved the attention. But he was so self-destructive and reckless, and would often be up drinking until five in the morning.

‘He was a terrible man in lots of ways but almost everybody who met him just sort of loved him.‘There would be one-offs with groupies. People would find women for him for the night and they would be queuing up.’

The film will also explore Dylan’s tempestuous relationship with Caitlin and highlight his unconventional relationship with John Brinnin. The gay critic was besotted with the writer, who had an extra-marital affair with Brinnin’s assistant Liz Reitell.

Actor and comedian Griff Rhys Jones, whose production company is making the drama, said: ‘There is enormous tragedy built into this. Dylan escapes into a bohemian world to get away from his problems. He went on the razzle  in a big way to try to drown out some of his sorrows.’

Thomas was admitted to St Vincent’s Hospital in New York on the morning of November 6 after he became ill following a late-night drinking session. He died on November 9, aged just 39.
