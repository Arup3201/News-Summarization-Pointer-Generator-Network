The gadgets we are set to want (and some we aren't) are being unveiled at the electronics worlds biggest exhibition.

The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas sees almost every manufacturer (apart from Apple) unveiling their 2013 gadgets.

It opens officially tomorrow - but has already produced a smart fork that can monitor what you eat, a computer you can use as a table, and the 'phablet' - a combined phone and tablet experts say could become this year's must have.

However,
computer maker Lenovo has something it believes will get families back 
together - a PC the size of a coffee table that works like a gigantic 
tablet and lets four people use it at once.

The 'table PC', a 17.8-pound, 27-inch Windows 8 Pro
machine.

Called the IdeaCenter Horizon Table PC, should be 
available ‘beginning in early summer’ at a starting price of $1,699, Lenovo, the
company behind it said.

‘Horizon
makes personal computing interpersonal computing with shared, 
collaborative experiences among several people,’ said Peter Hortensius, 
president of Lenovo's product group, in a company press release.

‘Now
many people can enjoy different photos, music and video on the same 
screen, and they can play games with our special accessories that blend 
physical and digital interaction’ he said.

The Horizon Table PC takes advantage of Windows 8's touch-based features to support multiplayer gaming among other activities.

Final preparations for the CES show, which has 1.85 million square feet of exhibition space and attract 150,000 attendees. The show begins on January 8, although some manufacturers have already held their own events.

Experts believe a raft of manufacturers will unveil big-screen phones to compete with Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 (pictured) making 2013 the year of the 'phablet'.

Experts have predicted that the reign
of the tablet and the mobile phone may be over - with 2013 set to be 
the year of the 'phablet'.

Analysts
claim the emergence of so-called 'giant mobile' which blend tablets and
mobile phones, will lead to a whole new category of gadgets.

The
upshot is a market for phablets that will quadruple in value to $135 
billion in three years, according to analysts at Barclays.

Shipments of gadgets that are 5 
inches or bigger in screen size will surge by nearly nine-fold to 228 
million during the same period, though estimates vary because no one can
agree on where smartphones stop and phablets start.

But that's the point, some say.

'I
think phone size was a preconceived notion based on voice usage,' said 
John Berns, a Singapore-based executive who works in the information 
technology industry.

The Table PC will include plastic 
'strikers' for 'Air Hockey,' and joysticks that attach to the screen 
with suction cups for other games, including multiplayer shooter 'Raiding Company'.

It even comes with a virtual electronic dice so that board games can still be played.

The first 'Table PC': The 17.8-pound, 27-inch Windows 8 Pro machine, which is called the IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC, should be available ¿beginning in early summer¿ at a starting price of $1,699, manufacturer Lenovo says

The table PC can even be used as an air hockey table

It runs NVIDIA GeForce graphics as well as ‘heart-pounding’ Dolby Home Theater v4 audio, Hortensius said.

The computer can transform into a 27-inch desktop for those who want to use it for solitary purposes.

There is one trade-off for all of those features.

The Horizon Table PC contains only two hours of battery life when not connected to a wall-socket.

Lenvo
is also getting ready to market a Horizon Multimode Table that will let
users change the angle and height of the PC from lying down flat to 
facing the user like a normal monitor.

Hortensius
said Lenovo is also getting ready to launch new editions of more 
traditional computers, including new IdeaPad and ThinkPad touchscreen 
Windows 8 notebooks.

The downside: The Horizon Table PC contains only two hours of battery life when not connected to a wall-socket

Microsoft Corp. pioneered the 
idea of a table PC with the Surface, a PC with a 30-inch 
(762-millimeter) touch-sensitive screen released in 2008.

It was designed for store displays and other commercial applications.

The concept is now called PixelSense, as Microsoft started using the 'Surface' name for an unrelated tablet computer last year.

More recently, Sony Corp. released the Tap 20, an all-in-one PC that can also be laid flat.

But
it is smaller than the Lenovo model, at 20 inches (508 millimeters) 
diagonally, and doesn't have as much table-oriented software as the 
Table PC.

Smart cutlery that can monitor exactly how much you eat was also revealed.

The HAPIfork uses electronic sensors to monitor how much , and how fast a user is eating.

If they eat too quickly, the fork vibrates, and bright lights flash on its handle.

The fork also wirelessly connects to a user's phone to send their eating habits to a special app.

The
HAPIfork's makers claim that people only naturally feel full after 
about 20 minutes of eating, and so by diminishing the amount eaten in 
that period users will eat less and consequently lose weight.

The
project, which is set to be funded via Kickstarter, will sell for $99, 
also claims to reduce digestive problems and acid reflux.

The Hapilabs fork, which wirelessly transmits details of how quickly you eat to an app. Eat too quickly, and it vibrates and flashes.

'Most people eat faster than they should and do not realise that eating 
too fast ins’t a healthy behaviour, negatively affecting things like 
digestion and weight control,' said HAPIlabs’ US President Andrew 
Carton.

The fork will track the duration of a meal, the number of fork servings and the duration of each interval between servings.

The smart fork can monitor any food, and warn user's if they are eating too quickly.

'Eating too fast, and not chewing long enough leads to poor digestion and poor weight control,' the firm says.

'Every time you bring food from your plate to your mouth with your fork, this action is called a 'fork serving'.

The
HAPIfork also measures how long it took to eat your meal, the amount of
'fork servings' taken per minute and intervals between 'fork servings'.

The
HAPIfork also comes with the HAPILABS app plus a coaching program to 
help you eat better and change your eating behavior, and is expected to 
go on sale in April.

The fork is set to go on sale in April for £60 ($99)
