A Texas woman tweeted a photo of herself and NFL player Arian Foster - only to find out from Foster himself that the man in the photo was actually a celebrity lookalike.

Jenni Bazard posed with a man she thought was the Houston Texans running back at Pub Fiction in Houston on Saturday night, and shared the image the next day.

'Ran into @ArianFoster at Pub Fiction last night! So blessed to get a picture with one of my favorite #HoustonTexans!!' Bazard tweeted.

It wasn't me! Foster was quick to let Bazard know he wasn't actually the man photographed

Foster seemed touched by the post, but quickly let her know it wasn't actually him.

'Lol I appreciate the love but that's not me,' he tweeted at Bazard.

Though Bazard's mistake has already gone viral, she told KHOU that she is taking it in stride.

'When Arian Foster re-tweeted me and said that’s not him and then how many tweets I was getting after that, I was like "Oh what do I do? What do I do?"

'But I was in the car with my best friend and she was like, "You know there’s two ways you can do this. You can run and hide or you can go with it." Then I was like you know what, it’s really funny, really embarrassing, but really funny, so you know people are gonna take a stab at it anyway whether or not I take it down, it’s already up there.'

Final swing: Foster posted this humorous tweet in response to the fan's criticism

Foster's interaction with Bazard wasn't the only humorous exchange he had on Twitter this weekend.

On Sunday night, he tweeted an inspirational message that said 'Luckily knowledge doesn't go anywhere. It's always there for the humble and hungry.'

One of Foster's follwer's criticized the post, writing 'You're not a philospher bro. Seriously. You're a running back.'

Foster quickly wrote a witty reply making fun of the fan's request.

'Me run fast. All day long. Yards. Touchdowns. Me catch ball. Run with ball to square space on grass. Make big guys miss,' he wrote.
