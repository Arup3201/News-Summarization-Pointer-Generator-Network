A five-year-old boy became trapped between two walls in China after he fell when playing with friends.

Firefighters rescued the boy who was playing in China's central Hunan Province, local media reported Friday.

Firefighters put a rag over the boy's head to shield his face as they used an axe and circular saw to cut through the bricks.

The firefighters tried to calm the child as they pulled his head free.

Finally, the boy was escaped and except for a few tears, he didn't appear injured.â€™

A man shook the hand of the firefighters, thanking them for their hard work after the boy had escaped.

Just a few months ago a man got trapped between two walls, again in China.

After a night of heavy drinking in 
Zhuzhou, Hunan Province, he fell into a gap between the two walls of a 
building on as he made his way home.

Unable to free himself, he spent an uncomfortable night trapped in the tight spot.

Relief: The five-year-old looks shocked as he is finally safe and free from the walls

Care: A woman dusts the boy off and talks to him after he is freed

Thank you: A man shakes the hands of the firefighters, who had managed to stay calm under the circumstances

Quite why he was walking home along the rooftops is another question 
entirely, and one he didn't answer when explaining himself to the 
emergency services who came to his rescue the following day.

He simply said: 'I cried for a long time but no one heard me. Then I fell asleep.'

When he woke he began cry out for help and was heard by a passer-by who called the emergency services.

Stunned firefighters used a thick rope with which to pull the heavy-eyed and embarrassed-looking man free.
