Crash: Shante Hopkins passed away in a massive smash on Saturday when an 18-wheel tractor trailer hit her stationary Mazda - killing her, three of her children and her friend

Tragedy: The driver of the truck was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and police think that Hopkins may have run out of gas

'There is nothing I can do right now I can barely eat, sleep. I am scared to drive myself,' said Hutchison to KCTV5.

'At that time she was calling me and letting me know that she was still on the highway and she needed me.

'She needed my help, but i couldn't help her at the time.'

Hopkins, who police revealed was driving on a revoked license was on Interstate 435 at around 5pm when her Mazda came to a halt on the far right traffic lane.

Minutes after her last call to her fiancé, Hopkins car was smashed from behind by an 18-wheel tractor trailer - which killed two of the occupants at the scene while the other three died later in hospital.

The driver of the truck has tested negative for drugs or alcohol and has been cooperating fully with police.

Kansas City police have said that witness statements and an examination of the crime scene suggest that Hopkins inexplicably stopped in the lane of traffic, despite her car having no history of faults.

On Monday, investigators said they were looking into the possibilty that the Mazda suffered a sudden mechanical failure or if the car simply ran out of gas.

Speaking to KansasCity.com, Hopkins' parents, Paulette Kelley and Riccardo Smith said that they were beside themselves with grief.

Hopkins' parents, Paulette Kelley and Riccardo Smith said that they were beside themselves with grief

“When her car started messing up, she pulled on over to the side. She was in her big, red car,” Smith said to Kansascity.com.

“That was my daughter and my grandbabies. That 7-month-old had just had his first Christmas, and now he’s gone!”

Hopkins's fourth child, an eight-year-old son was with his grandparents when the accident happened.

Speaking to KSHB.Com, Paulette Kelley recalled her last memory of her daughter and grandchildren.

'I saw my grandbabies and they were like ‘Mama, I love you, I love you.’

Dominique Johnson, who also passed away in the crash, was Hopkins' brother's girlfriend.

'I just saw her and she was gone and the phone call said she was gone,” Dominique’s sister, Anjuena Johnson, said. “It's hard because she's my little sister, so it hurts a lot and we were so close.”
