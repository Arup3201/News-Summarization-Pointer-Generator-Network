The Twitter accounts of some of the world's top models have been hacked by what appears to be a diet pill company.

Posts last night from the accounts of Lily Donaldson, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn and Tori Garrn invited followers to click on an alluring link that would then download a virus on their computer.

Tweets read: 'Best diet supplement for losing some weight' and 'Shred [sic] a few pounds with this simple daily diet.'

Model scare: The Twitter accounts of models such as Joan Smalls (left) and Jourdan Dunn (right) were hacked last night by an alleged diet pill company

As each of the slim models are normally extremely cautious when promoting their dietary habits through the social networking site, they were mortified to learn they had sent such messages to thousands of fans.

At this stage, it is unknown which company was responsible for the serious breach of privacy.

Hot property: British model Lily Donaldson was also affected

Once Joan Smalls, a Puerto Rican model, had discovered her account had been hacked, she deleted the tweet immediately.

She tweeted soon after: 'Please do not re tweet… My account got hacked. I Do Not Diet.'

She showed a sense of humour not 
long after, tweeting: 'I hope the individual who Hacked my account and 
so many other to promote a diet pill gets Severe erectile disfunction. 
#Karma [sic]'

Other models were equally annoyed.

Jourdan
Dunn, a British model who was announced today as the new face of Burberry Beauty, tweeted to her followers: 'Sooo my twitter 
account has been hacked… what kind of foolishness!!!! [sic]'

Toni Garrn, a Victoria's Secret model from Germany, seemed extremely concerned about being hacked.

She
tweeted after she made the discovery: 'so sorry everyone!! i dont know 
what happened IVE BEEN HACKED! what do i do!?DONT OPEN ANY MESSAGES!

It is not the first time a celebrity has been targeted by hackers of the weight-loss variety.

Eric Stonestreet, an actor from ABC's Modern Family, reported unknown tweeting from his account in January.

The chubby actor later said: 'Apparently I was doling out weight-loss pills… I think there's some cruel irony there.'

Problem: Joan Smalls' Twitter page showed one alluring link

Variation: Lily Donaldson's, albeit the spelling error, showed an attractive tweet

Again: Jourdan Dunn's Twitter showed the same message as Lily Donaldson's

Ashton Kutcher, who has one of the most popular Twitter accounts with more than 10million followers, was hacked in January also.

The model-turned actor told his fans later that he would seek revenge on the unknown culprit.

He tweeted: 'Ok mr hacker, you only made one mistake. You hacked my Foursquare and I now know your address. Whoops...This is gonna be fun. [sic]'
