Your mobile phone could reveal a lot about your income, and even predict which part of town you live in, it has been claimed.

These new maps reveal that in the world's biggest cities, those in affluent areas are far more likely to own Apple's iPhone, while those in lower income areas almost always own an Android handset.

The maps echo findings from app makers and advertisers, who say that iPhone owners download and spend far more on apps than Android owners.

Created by analysing tweets, the maps reveal where phone owners tweet from. They show that in New York, affluent iOS owners (shown in red) are in Manhattan, while the suburbs are dominated by lower cost Android handsets (green).

According to analysis firm App Annie, app developers make twice as much money from iOS apps than Android apps for - despite sales of handsets being in Android's favour.

Games continues to be the top category in both Google Play and the iTunes app store, accounting for 40 percent of all app downloads.

According to the most recent figures, there have been 50 billion total downloads from the Apple App Store, still just ahead of Google Play’s recently touted 48 billion.

In recent years android has been adopted by many low cost handset makers, and is hugely popular in pay as you go handsets.

Apple, on the other hand, still charges a premium for its products - with even its 'cheaper' iPhone 5C being far more expensive than Android handsets.

Research has also found that Android users are far less likely to download and use apps.

Despite android having 80% of market share in some countries, app makers still say they make twice as much money from iPhone users than they do android users, with many Android users believed to simply use their handset as a 'dumb' phone, rather than take advantage of its capabilities.

According to the most recent figures, there have been 50 billion total downloads from the Apple App Store, still just ahead of Google Play’s recently touted 48 billion.

Flurry, a mobile firm, also claims its research shows that for advertisers, Android customer is worth a quarter as much as an iPhone user.

The maps were created by MapBox and Gnip.

'Mobile Devices is a map that reveals the information about phone brands that is stored when people use an official Twitter App and is hidden in the metadata attached to each tweet,' MapBox said.

Each brand of phone is a different color and can be independently toggled.

'The patterns of usage in each city often reflect economic stratification.

'For example iPhones, in red, are predominantly in wealthy sections of the city while Android phones, in green, have more coverage in poorer sections.'

The firm analysed over 3bn tweets to create the map.

San Francisco, where iPhone owners cluster in the city's most affluent areas, with the 'hipster' Mission district being almost solid red.

'This is a look at 3 billion tweets - every geotagged tweet since September 2011, mapped, showing facets of Twitter’s ecosystem and userbase in incredible new detail, revealing demographic, cultural, and social patterns down to city level detail, across the entire world,' they say.

'We were brought in by the data team at Gnip, who have awesome APIs and raw access to the Twitter firehose, and together Tom and data artist Eric Fischer used our open source tools to visualize the data and build interfaces that let you explore the stories of space, language, and access to technology.'
