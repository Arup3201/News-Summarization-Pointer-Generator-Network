Kellie Maloney received a rapturous reception as she entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on Monday night.

Maloney, formerly Frank who promoted and managed Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, explained her decision to change gender earlier this month.

And, having been joined by heavyweight Audley Harrison in the house, she has been installed as the favourite to win the show.

Maloney, 61, is understood to be the highest earner, earning £400,000. Along with Harrison, she will share the house with 10 other contestants, including Benefits Street star White Dee, Stephanie Pratt from The Hills and Lauren Goodger from The Only Way is Essex.

Maloney wore a black dress as she was introduced to the crowd and admitted she was ‘terrified’ before entering the house.

In her introduction montage, she said: ‘As a woman, I’m enjoying being myself. I have a great family around me who are supporting me.

‘I would describe Kellie as a baby really, I’m coming to terms with a whole new lifestyle; how to dress, how to wear make-up.

‘I may be having a gender modification but I’m not having a brain transplant. I hope there’s no backstabbing, no bitchiness. I don’t want Frank Maloney the boxing promoter coming out to play.’

Harrison, 42, was next to make his entrance in a bold red suit but he too received a warm welcome.

Having won Olympic gold in 2000, he became European heavyweight champion but lost his biggest fights to David Haye, David Price and Deontay Wilder.

He said: ‘I’m an alpha male so if there’s alpha males in there we’re going to clash but hopefully we can have some harmony. I think it’s going to be very important as a group to set some ground rules.’

On entering the house, Harrison embraced Maloney and said: ‘F***ing hell, Frank!’, before asking: ‘so do I call you Kellie?’Maloney retorted: ‘Only if you want to get paid for your next fight!’

The celebrities will spend up to three weeks in the house with the winner receiving a cash prize for a charity of their choice.
