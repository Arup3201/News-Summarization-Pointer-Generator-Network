When a camera trap set up on the banks of Australia’s Kimberley’s Margaret River went missing earlier this year, local rangers assumed it had fallen into the water.

Yet three weeks later the camera was found almost 65 miles upriver and the footage revealed it had actually been stolen by a sea eagle.

The wings of the eagle are shown flapping during the one-minute clip before the bird lands and pecks at the screen. 

A sea eagle, in particular the White-Tailed variety, is also known as an 'erne' or 'ern'.

The birds vary in size from around 6lb to almost 20lbs.

Their diets consist mainly of fish and small mammals.

The last British sea eagle was shot in 1916 and the species disappeared from the wild for over 50 years but they are now thriving.

Species are found across north America, Australia and Europe.

The Gooniyandi Indigenous Rangers, including Roneil Skeen, set up the trap to capture footage of saltwater crocodiles in Northwest Australia.

On a routine check of the traps, Mr Skeen noticed the camera had gone missing and assumed it had been washed away.

A passer-by called the rangers three weeks later to say they had found the camera around 65 miles upriver from where the trap was set.

Once Mr Skeen examined the footage he discovered that a juvenile sea eagle had picked up the camera, flown for around 20 seconds before landing and pecking the screen. 

The first shots show the wings of the bird flapping as it flies along the river, it is then placed on the rocks on the river bed before capturing the full face of the winged thief.

‘Unexpectedly our camera went missing,’ Skeen told ABC Kimberley, ‘we thought that it had fallen into the water but a juvenile sea eagle came and took-off with it.’

It is not the first time birds have been caught interacting with cameras in the wild. In August a colony of Gentoo penguins tried to pick up a GoPro camera that had been set up on the Falkland Islands.

One shot record the inside of the penguins beak as it reached for the camera.

Other conservationists recently strapped cameras to the back of gannets off the coast of Wales to learn more about what they get up to 300 miles at sea.

The gannet cam discovered that the sea birds circle at 30 metres high before diving for fish at speeds of up to 60mph.

Watching the footage revealed male gannets tended to feed more at trawlers than females, too.

Dr Votier said this difference may have conservation implications when a ban on discarding is implemented under reforms to the EU Common Fisheries Policy.
