Stan Kroenke leaped to the defence of his Arsenal regime in the face of a fierce attack from club shareholders.

The Gunners board, including majority
 shareholder Kroenke, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and chairman Peter 
Hill-Wood, came under scathing criticism from supporters at the annual 
general meeting.

Testing times: Arsene Wenger spoke at the AGM - less than 24 hours after Arsenal's home defeat to Schalke

Big blow: Arsenal were beaten at home by Schalke in the Champions League on Wednesday night

Supporters are disillusioned with the perceived lack of investment in the playing squad and the cost of tickets.

Kroenke said: ‘I am ambitious for the club. We have an exciting future and our goal is to win trophies.’

Not even the silver-tongued Arsene Wenger could keep the heat off Arsenal’s board at Thursday's stormy AGM.

The manager did his best to placate irate fans who arrived intent on venting their anger at the top table.

Heated: Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis had to call for order at the AGM

But no amount of smooth talking was going to prevent the Gunners’ supporters from making their feelings clear.

Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke was
 roundly jeered by shareholders when refusing to provide a definitive 
answer on whether he has plans to take a dividend percentage out of the 
club coffers.

Similar treatment was dished out to 
chief executive Ivan Gazidis as he reeled off reasons why Arsenal will 
be in a financial position to compete in the transfer market for the 
world’s best players in two years.

‘We’ve heard it all before,’ yelled  shareholders as Gazidis spelt out 
why the club’s self-sustaining financial model means on-the-pitch 
success will follow in the not-too-distant future.

It’s hard not to have a degree of  sympathy with Arsenal supporters. No 
trophy since 2005, two successive summers of losing their best players 
and a team 10 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea.

And if the heckling was not enough, there were even boos for the club’s 
76-year-old chairman Peter Hill-Wood, whose patronising behaviour 
towards supporters angered shareholders.

As ever, Wenger tried his best but even the Frenchman could not ignore 
the fact divisions are starting to appear, particularly among the club’s
 fan base.

‘There seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction, I can understand that,’ 
said Wenger. ‘But we have to be united. I accept every different opinion
 but it looks to me like the modern world produces little groups of 
little opinion.

‘The little communities need to live together for the common strength of
 our club, for the good of Arsenal. Sometimes you can forget that. But 
if everybody is devastated when we finish third in the league, I promise
 I won’t be here when we finish 15th in the league.

'Players ask: are you in the Champions League? A new player doesn't want to know if you have won the League Cup.'

If only: Arsenal supporters would love to see the likes of Ibrahim Afellay in an Gunners shirt - the Schalke played swapped jerseys at the end of Wednesday night's Champions League clash at the Emirates

Wenger was the only top-table speaker afforded a round of applause. And it is important to add that the vitriol was in no way 
aimed at him.

It was not long after the 11.30am start that supporters started to convey their growing displeasure.
Why are the tickets so expensive? Why do we keep selling our best 
players? Why do we not spend heavily in the transfer market? Why does it
 cost £13.90 for fish and chips? The probing  questions kept coming from
 supporters fed up with paying top prices without getting trophies in 
return.

There was a cringeworthy moment for Gazidis when around 15 hands went up
 as the meeting was asked if anyone did not agree with his re-election 
as chief executive for another term.

But Hill-Wood’s reaction to Gazidis’s naysayers was on an altogether 
different scale of discomfort as he mumbled into his microphone: ‘The 
same lot again.’

Yes, Peter, the same lot again. The same lot who are facing an eighth season without silverware and want answers.

Gone: Arsenal sold their best player - captain Robin van Persie - to Manchester United in the summer
