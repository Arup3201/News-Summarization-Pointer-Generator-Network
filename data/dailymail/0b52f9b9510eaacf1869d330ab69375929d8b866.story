It is the acclaimed White House drama charting the rise to power of the scheming politician Frank Underwood.

But with fans eagerly awaiting the release of the third series of House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, Sesame Street has come up with its own version - based on the fairytale 'The Three Little Pigs'.

The parody features Frank Under-wolf and his evil plan to blow down the straw house and the stick house before taking over the 'White-brick House'. 

Huffing and puffing: Sesame Street has released a parody of the House of Cards called House of Bricks - featuring Frank Underwolf (pictured)

In true Sesame Street style, the four-minute clip features a series of puns relating to the two stories and includes a number of maths lessons along the way.

Underwolf even delivers some classic Frank Underwood phrases reeled off in the fictional politician's South Carolina accent.

At one point, the pink wolf says: 'In this town, you have to know which way the wind is blowing - and right now it's about to get very windy'. 

Referencing the three pigs cowering in their house, he adds: 'Some people say there's too much pork in this town - I could not agree more.'

Rise to power: The entire 13-episode third season of House of Cards begins streaming on Netflix on Friday

The entire 13-episode third season of House of Cards begins streaming on Netflix on Friday.

Earlier seasons chart the ruthless politician's ascent to power and how he plots his way to becoming President of the United States.

The Sesame Street version - called 'House of Bricks' sees Frank Underwolf huffing and puffing his way towards the White brick House. 

But while the 'biggest, baddest wolf of them all' is sitting comfortably in the Oval Office - and having tapped the table twice with his hand just like conniving Frank Underwood - the three little pigs strike back by blowing the house down.

As playing cards flutter down around them, one startled pig says: 'It wasn't a house of bricks at all. It was just a house of - cards!'
