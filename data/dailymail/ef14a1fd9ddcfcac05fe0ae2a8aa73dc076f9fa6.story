When Labour's first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at a trust, his government waited over a year to order a probe

Labour stood accused last night of presiding over abuses and cover-ups on the scale of the Mid Staffordshire healthcare scandal at another trust.

A leaked copy of an investigation into the appalling neglect of an elderly patient found that a Welsh trust failed to hold a proper inquiry into the case, despite having told her family that it had taken place.

And when Labour’s first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at the trust, his government waited over a year to order a probe.

Eighty-two-year-old Lilian Williams died after a string of failings at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales.

She was denied life-saving medication, allowed to starve for days and left in agony because her prosthetic leg was not taken off at night.

Her son said the three years of cover-ups and delays put other patients at risk, because action to improve standards were not taken.

Dozens of other examples of poor care at the trust have emerged over the past few months – adding to fears of a Mid Staffs scandal in Wales. Three nurses have been arrested over the falsification of patient records.

The family’s lawyer said that the case was even worse than that of Mid Staffs because of the trust’s attempt to ‘suppress’ criticisms and cover up failings.

Lilian Williams, a mother of five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board.

In 2010, she was admitted to the hospital with shingles, but when her family went to visit they found her lying in excrement.

Her son Gareth, 54, said life-saving medicine was scattered on the floor, and she had spent the weekend without food or water.

The family was told that police and social services would be carrying out a ‘Protection of Vulnerable Adults’ inquiry, and that staff would be retrained to ensure the neglect did not happen again.

But two years later, when Mrs Williams was admitted to a different hospital run by the same trust, she had to endure ‘the same shameful neglect’.

When her son demanded to know why the improvements promised had not been implemented, the hospital admitted the inquiry had never taken place. ‘We’d been lied to,’ he said.

A POVA inquiry was finally held, which found that Mrs Williams’s dentures had not been removed at night, that nurses failed to administer prescribed medicine, and that they failed to care for her amputated limb.

The report, which has been seen by the Mail, concluded that it was ‘proved’ that the board had given ‘false statements and false assurances’ over the scope of the earlier inquiry, and that the family had been ‘misled’.

Under devolution, the NHS in Wales is controlled by Labour – not by the Coalition based in Westminster – and at the time of the failings, the trust’s board was chaired by a former Labour MP Win Griffiths.

Jeremy Hunt called earlier this month for a proper inquiry into failings of hospitals in Wales. It emerged last week that the Welsh NHS ignored warnings from NHS England that death rates at hospitals like the one in Bridgend were dangerously high.

The Health Secretary said: ‘These tragic examples of poor care in Labour-controlled Wales deserve proper public scrutiny. It is a total betrayal of patients in Wales to think the lessons of Mid Staffs somehow stop at the border.’

Mr Williams notified Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones of the case in June 2012, but it took until October 2013 for Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford to call a public review into standards at the trust.

Last night Mr Jones said he was involved in the case not as first minister but as Mr Williams’s local assembly member. He said: ‘It is simply not true to say that no action has been taken by myself. I met with him and made several representations on his behalf.’

Last night a source at the ABMU trust denied there had been a cover-up and said there had been a misunderstanding over what sort of inquiry was going to be held.

The source said that although there had not been a POVA inquiry with police and social services involvement in 2010, there had been an internal investigation.

Lilian Williams’s family only found out that an inquiry had not taken place into her appalling care in 2010 when she was admitted to hospital again two years later. 

When Mrs Williams, pictured, became ill in August 2012, she begged her son Gareth not to take her back to the Princess of Wales, so they went to the neighbouring Neath Port Talbot Hospital, part of the  same trust.

However Mr Williams said the standard of care at the second hospital was even worse than before. ‘We found her slumped in the chair amid pools of urine, tablets dropped and dissolved, bloody swabs hanging around,’ he recalled.

‘Two years on, we were finding the same shocking neglect. What this showed is that it was endemic throughout the trust; this culture of nonchalance and indifference.’ 

Later in the year she was admitted a final time. As her life ebbed away, the doctors withdrew treatment because they said she had pneumonia.

But the post-mortem examination showed she hadn’t had pneumonia at all. Her death was put down to a heart attack, probably due to the withdrawal of anti-blood clot medication.

After the POVA inquiry found that Mrs Williams had been treated badly, the police began to look at the hospital and have arrested three nurses for fabricating blood sugar records.

Mr Williams said: ‘Three nurses have been hung out to dry to protect management, to cover up that fabrication of records had been going on for years.’
