Not guilty: Susan Butt was cleared of fraud today at Guildford Crown Court

A jury took just 13 minutes to acquit a woman who was accused of stealing almost £250,000 pounds from the former wife of one of Britain's richest men.

Susan Butt was found not guilty today of stealing the cash from Joyce Harrison, ex-wife of multimillionaire computer magnate Sir Peter Harrison

The 48-year-old defendant wept as the
jury returned two 'not guilty' verdicts on charges that she had betrayed her relationship as the mother of Mrs Harrison's 
grandchild to steal the money after she had suffered a stroke 
in 2011.

Afterwards the Harrison family was accused of persecuting the defendant, whose 11-year-old daughter would return home from school and ask if she was going to prison.

Miss Butt, of Hookwood in Surrey, had been the live-in lover of Mrs Harrison's wayward son Nick, and had a daughter by him, the jury heard.

But she left him after suffering years of domestic abuse.

The trial at Guildford Crown Court heard she and Mrs Harrison forged a close relationship to escape from the super wealthy family, which was described by Miss Butt's defence counsel Justin Rouse as 'spectacularly abnormal' and 'violent'.

Mrs Harrison, who died last year aged 77, received £20 million after she divorced Sir Peter in 2005 following years of domestic abuse.

The trial heard Mrs Harrison bought Miss Butt a £650,000 house in Reigate, Surrey, and agreed to give her a further £249,000 pounds to set up a restaurant business with her current, boyfriend Andre Baker.

Sir Peter, who amassed a personal fortune of £300 million when he sold his computer business, hired a private investigator to probe the money his former wife had given away to Miss Butt

The evidence was passed to the police, who decided to bring charges of theft and fraud against Miss Butt.

But the jury cleared Miss Butt of any wrongdoing.

Miss Butt was too upset to speak to reporters after the case concluded today.

However, Mr Baker accused Sir Peter of 'persecution'.

He said: 'This was the right decision - justice has been brought. This case should never have come to court.

'This has been hanging over us now for two years. In that time, our business has gone to the wall and £250,000 pounds has been lost because of the persecution of this family.

'At the centre of all of this has been her (Miss Butt's) 11-year-old daughter, who has been coming home each day saying "are you going to prison mummy?"

'That's their granddaughter, for God's sake. How can they have done that do their own flesh and blood?'

Speaking outside court, Sir Peter said: 'I was here for justice for my former wife Joy, but sadly the jury did not see it that way.

'That is the way our justice system works, so I respect the decision of the jury.'

During her trial Miss Butt claimed she came to be regarded as a daughter-in-law by Mrs Harrison.

The court heard she left the volatile relationship with son Nick and was given money by Mrs Harrison to help her become independent.

Mr Rouse said Mrs Harrison and Miss Butt had forged a close bond due to their shared experience of domestic abuse in the Harrison household.

He said businessman Sir Peter was a domestic abuser and had a violent temper.

He told the jury: 'She (Joyce) was happy to be helping Sue to be independent of her son. 

'She did not care, you may think, how Sue decided to spend the money. She was happy to help her.'

The trial heard Mrs Harrison had given Miss Butt and Mr Baker £650,000 to buy a house, which was signed off by trustees of the Harrison family fortune.

But the prosecution claimed Miss Butt then wrote herself cheques from Mrs Harrison’s HSBC account to the tune of £237,500 to start a restaurant called Pacific Bar and Grill in Reigate, Surrey.

The blank cheques were alleged to have been fraudulently filled out by Butt between September 4, 2011, and February 9 last year after Mrs Harrison suffered a series of strokes. Mr Rouse denied this.

He descrbed the Harrison family as 'spectacularly abnormal', adding that Mrs Harrison’s son was 'estranged to her and was violent'.

In a damning statement, Mr Rouse said: 'This (Nick) was someone who had been inside. He had a cocaine addiction. He had an addiction to drink.

'He was someone who you may say had a feckless youth, and Peter Harrison wanted him to settle down.

'Peter Harrison is a shrewd judge of character and in this woman Sue Butt he found someone who brought stability.

'Essentially, she was a brood mare. She was someone who was going to bring him (Nick) a son.'

He added: 'You can’t be surprised Joyce Harrison wanted to bring some normality into that child’s life.

'The fact is Nick Harrison was given a great deal of money - it was referred to in interview as £80million - far too early.

'As someone once said: "If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to."'

Mr Rouse described Joyce Harrison as a 'lovely person' who found herself trapped in the 'clutches of the Harrison family'.

He added: 'After her divorce, she was a lady who was 70 and who went off with £20million pounds.

'She had escaped the Harrisons and how had she done that? She had done it with the help of someone she referred to as her daughter-in-law.'

The prosecution case had relied on a witness statement from Mrs Harrison written shortly before her death.

In it, the millionairess said she did not know about the Pacific Bar and Grill venture and felt 'betrayed' by Butt.

However, Mr Rouse said the statement was fiction.

He said: 'You heard crocodile tears from the prosecution about her not being here.

'It would have been catastrophic for the prosecution if she had been here because she would not have recognised that statement.'

Sir Peter, the former chairman and chief executive of Chernikeef and vice-chairman of Chelsea Football Club, was present throughout the trial. 

Miss Butt was also cleared of fraudulently attempting to cause a £12,000 cheque to be paid to the Pacific Bar and Grill on February 8 last year.
