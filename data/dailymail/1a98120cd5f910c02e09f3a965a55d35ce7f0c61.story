A baby gorilla being temporarily  raised by human surrogate parents is doing well while learning to roll over, sit up and nearly walk on all fours.

Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden primate specialists say two-month-old 'Gladys' is in good health, developing and growing quickly with loving care from 10 humans imitating a gorilla mom's behavior.

This week she began supporting herself on all fours.

Growing up: Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden Primate Team Leader Ron Evans lays with baby Gladys, seen here at just 2-months-old

Taken care of: Gladys is said to be in good health while in the loving care of 10 humans imitating a gorilla mother's behavior after her biological mother showed no interest in her

Life together: Mr Evans works on paperwork on a bed of hay as Gladys sleeps on his back cloaked in black hair meant to resemble a gorilla's

Gladys came to Cincinnati last month 
from Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, after she was born there 
Jan. 29 to a first-time mother who showed little maternal instinct.

It was decided to move her to 
Cincinnati's zoo because of its extensive experience in raising gorilla 
babies and its availability of experienced gorilla mothers.

'The next step, she'll be able to walk around by herself,' said Ron Evans, primate team leader, commonly now seen with Gladys on his back.

Growing strong, Gladys also is teething and has begun eating some cooked foods, such as sweet potatoes and carrots, besides being bottle-fed five times a day.

'She's at the age now where she really starts growing by leaps and bounds,' Mr Evans said.

Role model: Primate Keeper Ashley O'Connell carries Gladys, an endangered Western Lowland Gorilla on her back, in an effort to model other gorilla behavior

New home: Zoo specialists think she will be ready within a few months to be moved to the care of one of four perspective mother gorillas they believe will latch onto her

Support: Ms O'Connell, who just had her first child five months ago, cuddles with Gladys who flashes a bright pink tongue and wide, energetic eyes

Human surrogates dress in black, wear furry vests and kneepads and make gorilla sounds to help prepare Gladys for the transition to a real gorilla family. They have been showing her to other gorillas and letting them touch her.

‘I'm not gonna lie, she's waking up now too, it's fun, but, more importantly it's a big responsibility that we do not take the least little bit lightly,’ Mr Evans told the Cincinnati Enquirer while lying in a bed of straw. The little gorilla was seen nestled on his black back.

‘It's a privilege to get the opportunity to do it and despite how much we might like hanging out with Gladys,  the thing that we are looking most for in return is the day she goes in with a mother gorilla,' he continued.

It's especially important with western lowland gorillas being critically endangered in the wild.

Newborn: In February adorable photos of the baby being cared for at the Texas zoo after her birth were released

Left behind: The zoo said that after the baby was born in January its mother just walked away, showing no interest in caring for it

Cared for: Zoo workers immediately went to work making sure the newborn was bottle fed every two hours

Experts: The baby was later sent specifically to the Ohio zoo because of their experienced care with newborn gorillas

The Enquirer reports that zoo specialists think she will be ready within a few months to be transferred to a new mother. There are four potential adoptive moms among their gorillas.

'The gorillas have to decide who this baby's mom is going to be,' said Mr Evans.

'That will be the day that all this hard work pays off,' said primate keeper Ashley O'Connell, crawling around with the 9-pound gorilla riding on her back.

Ms O'Connell just had her own first child five months ago.

'I feel like I'm the mother of two right now,' she said. 'If I have to be away from my own child, this is where I want to be.'
