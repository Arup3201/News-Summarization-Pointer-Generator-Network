Ramiro Delcid, 20, shot dead his girlfriend, Dina Dicochea, 19, before calling the emergency services

A man shot his girlfriend dead with a gun he did not realise was loaded.

Investigators said the man, 20-year-old Ramiro Delcid, thought it would be funny to scare Dina Dicochea.

Deputies and medical staff arrived within minutes, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to deputies, Delcid shot Ms Dicochea in the chest after thinking it would be funny to scare her by pointing the gun at her.

He told officers he thought he had taken all of the bullets out of his revolver only to find out there was one left in it when he fired the shot.

The incident took place in a company truck just before 7pm on Monday in Florence, near Phoenix in Arizona, United States.

He called for the emergency services himself and has now been jailed for negligent homicide.

Sheriff Paul Babeu said: 'This case is a tragic reminder of how quickly a life can be taken by those who handle firearms irresponsibly.

'Ramiro took the life of his girlfriend because he thought it would be funny to scare her with a gun.

'His poor judgment and decision-making took the life of this young woman with her entire life ahead.'

Reyna Soqui, who is a neighbour of Delcid, believes it was an accident, and said he loved his girlfriend.

She told WNEM: 'I have known Ramiro my whole life. He's been a great guy.'

Ms Soqui said he had recently moved to the area and that the couple lived together.
