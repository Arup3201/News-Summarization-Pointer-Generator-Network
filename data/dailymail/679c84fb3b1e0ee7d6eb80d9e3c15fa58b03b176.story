Two long-standing political stalwarts who were expected to face defeat in primary elections held on to their seats in a night of unexpected turnarounds yesterday.

Six-term Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out tea party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel in a bruising, costly Republican runoff that pitted Washington clout against Tea Party values and an insistence on conservative purity.

In New York's Harlem and upper Manhattan, 84-year-old Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, a 22-term congressman and the third-most-senior member of the House, celebrated after leading the vote 47 to 44 per cent - but his challenger refused to concede.

Victory speech: Six-term Senator Thad Cochran won back the support of his party in Mississippi,  beating out tea-party challenger Chris McDaniel in a primary runoff on Tuesday

With 99 per cent of precincts 
reporting, Cochran had 51 per cent to McDaniel's 49 per cent, three 
weeks after McDaniel had beaten the veteran lawmaker in the initial 
primary round but had fallen short of the majority needed for 
nomination. In the three-week dash to the runoff, Cochran and his allies
 had highlighted his seniority while McDaniel had argued that Cochran 
was part of a blight of federal overspending.

In
 a brief speech, Cochran credited those who helped. 'It's a group 
effort, it's not a solo and so we all have a right to be proud of our 
state tonight.'

McDaniel savaged the Republican party on Tuesday night after his narrow defeat. According to the Huffington Post, he condemned Cochran for courting Democratic voters.

He told supporters: '[The GOP] was a party of principle at one point. A party of courage at one point. It was Reagan that said, ''We will be a party of bold colors, not pastels.'' And yet there are millions of people who feel like strangers in their own party.'

He continued: 'There is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary that's decided by liberal Democrats. So much for bold colors. So much for principle. I guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight by once again compromising, by once again reaching against the aisle, by once again abandoning the conservative movement.'

The victory for a stalwart of the Senate Appropriations Committee was a fresh blow to the tea party movement, which spent millions to cast aside Cochran, a mainstream Republican who won a U.S. House seat in President Richard Nixon's GOP wave of 1972 and has served in the Senate for more than three decades.

In another setback for the tea party, two-term Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma won the GOP nomination in the race to succeed Senator Tom Coburn, who is stepping down with two years left in his term.

In the solidly Republican state, Lankford is all but assured of becoming the next senator. Part of the House GOP leadership, Lankford defeated TW Shannon, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and the state's first black House speaker, backed by former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, two stalwarts of the right.

Despite Congress' abysmal public approval ratings, incumbents have largely prevailed midway through the primary season — with two notable exceptions.

Little-known college professor Dave Brat knocked out House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Virginia's Republican primary this month, and Republican Representative Ralph Hall, 91, lost in a Texas runoff to a younger Republican.

McDaniel declared as he voted Tuesday, 'We are here, we're going to fight for our belief system no matter what, and we're going to reclaim Washington, DC, one race at a time.'

But Cochran and his allies, notably former Governor Haley Barbour, promoted his Washington establishment credentials, focusing on the billions he funneled to his home state, one of the poorest in the nation.

In a last-ditch effort, Cochran reached out to traditionally Democratic voters — blacks and union members — who could cast ballots in the runoff. That possible factor in Cochran's victory is sure to be cited by critics in days and weeks to come.

In predominantly black neighborhoods of Hattiesburg's south side, an organized effort for Cochran was evident. Ronnie Wilson, a 50-year-old unemployed Hattiesburg man, said he had been encouraged by his pastor to vote for Cochran.

'They say the other guy is trying to cut food stamps and all that,' Wilson said. 'I'm trying to look after the majority of people not working.'

McDaniel had railed against the federal 'spending sprees' by Cochran but his calls to slash the budget unnerved some voters.

Frank McCain, a 71-year-old retired tax administrator from Mendenhall, voted for Cochran.

'I believe he is doing a good job,' McCain said. 'But mostly I'm more scared of the other candidate. He wants to do things like not taking school funding when everyone else is.'

The Mississippi contest was the marquee race on a busy June primary day that included New York, Oklahoma, Colorado, Maryland and Utah.

In a special House election on Florida's Gulf Coast, voters chose Republican businessman Curt Clawson to replace former Representative Trey Radel, who resigned in January after pleading guilty to cocaine possession.

In New York's Harlem and upper Manhattan,  84-year-old Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, a 22-term congressman and the third-most-senior member of the House, held a slight edge over state Senator Adriano Espaillat, bidding to become the first Dominican-American member of Congress.

With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Rangel had 47 per cent of the vote compared to Espaillat's 44 percent, according to the Associated Press.

Espaillat has refused to concede with votes still to be counted.

Rangel seemed content to celebrate his apparent victory at an election party in East Harlem. According to DNAinfo, he told the crowd: 'I think this election is historic. It shows the changes taking place in America.'

Rangel, the face of Harlem politics for generations, raised his arms aloft and smiled. There is not a Republican contender for the seat, all but assuring Rangel's 23rd term in Congress.

'This was your victory,' Rangel told the crowd. 'This is your congressman. And you can rest assured all I will be doing is thinking about you and bringing resources back home.'

Rangel, one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, drew criticism last month when he dismissed the 59-year-old Espaillat as a candidate whose only accomplishment was to be a Dominican in a majority Latino district.

Two years ago, Rangel prevailed in the primary by fewer than 1,100 votes.

In Mississippi, outside groups, from tea party organizations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, spent some $12million on the GOP Senate runoff.

Former Green Bay Packers quarterback — and Gulfport, Mississippi, native — Brett Favre called the 76-year-old Cochran a 'proven and respected leader' in one Chamber ad.

McDaniel, 41, an attorney and former radio host, had the strong backing of Palin and the tea party movement, which saw his political approach as a change from a Washington status quo of mainstream conservatives willing to compromise.

Kellie Phipps, a 42-year-old public school teacher from Taylorsville, voted for McDaniel. 'I think we need some new blood,' Phipps said.

In November, Cochran will face Democrat Travis Childers, a former congressman, in the heavily Republican state.

In Colorado on Tuesday, former Representative Bob Beauprez won the crowded gubernatorial primary that included 2008 presidential candidate Tom Tancredo, an immigration opponent.

That was welcome news to national Republicans who feared that Tancredo could be a drag on the GOP ticket in November. Beauprez will face Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper.

In Maryland, Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown won the Democratic primary for governor as the state chose a successor to outgoing Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid. If elected in the Democratic-leaning state, Brown would make history as one of the few African-American governors; Massachusetts' Deval Patrick is retiring.

Happy day: Former U.S. Representative Bob Beauprez won the Republican nomination to run for Governor in Colorado, pushing out competitor Tom Tancredo, a 2008 presidential candidate and strong immigration opponent

Bad news: Tancredo, pictured above at an election night gathering, won't be going on to face incumbent Governor John Hickenlooper
