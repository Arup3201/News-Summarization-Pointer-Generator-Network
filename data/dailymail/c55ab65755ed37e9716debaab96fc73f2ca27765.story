The behaviour of Chelsea’s players as they surrounded Bjorn Kuipers was nothing short of disgraceful, but it’s a sign of the way the modern game is going. 

Blue shirts swarmed around the Dutch referee and the pressure put on him by Jose Mourinho’s men certainly played a part in the harsh dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his challenge on Oscar, after replays suggested the PSG man pulled out. 

Chelsea are not the only team to harrass officials on a regular basis and it’s time we introduced a rule to put an end to it.

There should only be one player from each side allowed to approach the referee and that is the captain. 

This is the only way to combat it.

Chelsea were eliminated from the Champions League on away goals as they drew 2-2 with PSG, the tie finishing 3-3 on aggregate.
