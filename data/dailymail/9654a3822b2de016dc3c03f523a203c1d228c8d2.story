The Americans lived up to the hype and then some, winning their first Olympic gold medal in women's gymnastics since 1996.

Not only did Americans Alexandra Raisman, Gabrielle Douglas, Jordyn Wieber, McKayla 
Maroney and Kyla Ross win, but they won big.

Their score of 183.596 Tuesday night was a whopping five points ahead of Russia.

Romania won the bronze medal.

Some teenagers might find that pressure tough to bear, but the Americans reveled in it.Â 

'We knew we could do it. We just had to pull out all the stops,' said Miss Raisman, the team captain.

Miss Maroney added: 'There were a lot of rumors that we couldn't do this because we won worlds, and there were a lot of doubts,' We went out there to prove something and that's what we did.'

When they saw the Russians and Romanians peeking in the doorway during training sessions, they would add some extra zest to their routines, the better to intimidate the competition.

Miss Douglas said: 'It's crazy to think the U.S. hasn't won a 
gold medal since '96 . I was feeling so confident, 
though. You have to feel confident and believe in yourself and trust. If
 you can do that, everything's going to be OK.'

And when the gold was on the line, the Americans were simply spectacular.

Coach John Geddert, who is also Miss Wieber's personal coach, went a step farther.

He said: 'This is the best team all-time. Others 
might disagree. The '96 team might disagree. But this is the best team. 
Difficulty-wise, consistency wise, this is USA's finest.'

The team essentially won the gold medal with their first event, vault, putting on a fireworks show right in front of the Russians.

All of the Americans do Amanars, one of 
the toughest vaults in the world - a roundoff onto the takeoff board, 
back handspring onto the table and 2.5 twisting somersaults before 
landing.

It's got a start value - the measure of difficulty - of 6.5, a whopping 0.7 above the vault most other gymnasts do, and they ripped off one massive one after another.

World champion Jordyn Wieber went first and did perhaps the best one she's ever done, getting great height in the air with her legs locked together.

When her feet slammed into the mat on landing, she threw up her arms and smiled broadly.

Miss Wieber's triumph followed a crushing disappointment on Sunday, when she missed a shot at Olympic gold due to international rules that allow only two competitors per country in the finals.

She finished fourth in Sunday's
 qualifying round, but will miss a shot at Olympic gold because 
international rules allow only two competitors per country in the 
finals.

Her longtime coach, John Geddert, slammed the 'stupid' rule, saying it penalised countries like the United States.

'In
 this system it's a shame that the all-around champion doesn't get to 
compete in the finals at the Olympics because of a stupid rule,' Mr 
Geddert said.

But speaking today, Miss Wieber called her team's gold medal-winning performance 'redemption.'

The two-per-country rule has been in 
place in each of the last two games, designed to give gymnasts from 
other countries a chance to make it to finals.

Ms Wieber has only lost two all-around competitions in the last three years, both of them to teammates.

Following Wieber's performance today, Gabby Douglas went next and her vault was even better.

And then came McKayla Maroney, who 
let everyone know why she's a heavy favorite to add the Olympic gold to 
her world title in vault.

She
 hit the mat with tremendous force yet didn't so much as wiggle, 
triumphantly thrusting her arms in the air as she saluted the judges.

The Americans strutted out of the event with a 1.7-point lead, and never looked back.

With
 the Russians on the sidelines crying, the Americans stood at the center
 of the flow, clapping, cheering and basking in a golden glow.

When the score for captain Aly 
Raisman flashed, the Americans screamed and a chant of 'U-S-A! U-S-A!' 
rang out around the arena.

Emotions: Americans finished five points ahead of silver medallist Russia, who were in tears at the conclusion of the event

Second place: Team Russia, which took home the silver medal, was left stunned by the U.S. performance

The Americans had come into the last two Olympics as world champions, only to leave without a gold.

But this team is the strongest, top to bottom, the USA has ever had, and the rest of the world never stood a chance.

After the U.S. opened with a barrage of booming vaults, everyone else was playing for silver.Russia erased all but four-tenths of 
the deficit on uneven bars, where Viktoria Komova and Aliya Mustafina 
defy the laws of gravity, but the team began falling apart on balance 
beam.

Mustafina swayed and wobbled so badly
 on the landing of a leap it's a wonder she didn't fall off; Komova 
almost stepped on the judges on her dismount.

'We did everything we could,' Komova said.

The Americans, meanwhile, made the 4-inch slab that stands 4 feet in the air look like child's play.

Feat: U.S. gymnast Alexandra Raisman wows the crowd as she performs on the balance beam

Kyla Ross, the only American who 
wasn't on that world team last year (she was too young), looks like a 
ballerina with her long legs and gorgeous lines. She landed one 
somersault with her left foot curled over the edge of the beam, yet 
never flinched.

Douglas has struggled on balance beam
 all summer, with a fall the second day of the U.S. championships 
costing her the title. But she has been clutch in London, delivering the
 highest score in qualifying and again Tuesday night.

She whipped off a series of backflips as if she was still on the ground, a look of intense concentration on her face.

She had a small balance check on a 
leap, swaying slightly and waving her arms to steady herself, but it was
 a minor error. Her score of 15.233 would all but seal the gold for the 
Americans, and they strutted over to floor exercise eager to close out 
the night with a big show.

While the Russians struggled - 
Anastasia Grishina stumbled forward on one pass and botched another when
 she all but came to a dead stop in the middle of the floor, and world 
champion Ksenia Afanaseva landed her dismount on her knees - the 
Americans kicked off their victory party.

Wieber's bright smile grew as she danced and tumbled, the crowd clapping in time to her techno pop music.

Fans the world over are going to have
 the 'Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo' from the start of Douglas' music in their
 heads, and little girls are sure to be bouncing in their backyards 
trying to get as high as she does on her leaps.

Raisman closed it out with a 
rollicking routine to 'Hava Nagila.' While her teammates cheered, 
Raisman soared high on her tumbling passes yet she landed so securely 
she may as well have been stepping into a bucket of cement.

Coach Mihai Brestyan was jumping up 
and down as Raisman finished, the tears already starting to fall. But as
 she fell into her teammates arms, the tears turned to shrieks of joy.
