Killing: Michael Watkins, 42, confessed to shooting his mother with a gun and bow and arrow before stabbing her, telling police she stole his diamonds and gave his father cancer

Deputies from the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office  responded to a 2:48 a.m. call, after another homeowner reported a man was knocking over their Christmas decorations and shouting.

An officer approached the home next door and spotted the mother slumped forward on a couch through the front door.

According to the police report, Watkins exited the home with a large knife dangling from a sheath at his waist and pointed at his mother inside, telling deputies, 'You see that, that's death.'

The report stated that Watkins told cops his mother 'stole his diamonds and also gave his father cancer' and 'he had to kill her because she was trying to kill him.'

Watkins ignored repeated calls to get down on the ground, finally complying before springing back up and pulling the knife from his belt, according to police.

Deputies twice fired a Taser at Watkins. He was charged with murder and resisting arrest without violence.

According to the arrest report, Watkins had been unemployed for more than five years. It also listed his address as the same as his mother's. 

At the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Booking Facility, Watkins was asked if he knew why he was there and responded, 'Yeah, I killed my f------ mom,' the report stated.
