Sir Alex Ferguson was ridiculed by some for repeatedly turning up at Manchester United matches last season, but  Phil Neville, a coach during David Moyes' disastrous reign, says he actually wasn't there enough.

Moyes endured a torrid campaign as United boss before being sacked in April, and there were those who felt he was undermined by Ferguson's presence on the board and in the Old Trafford stands.

But Phil Neville, who played under both Ferguson and Moyes, has hit back at suggestions that the legendary 72-year-old was around too much last season.
