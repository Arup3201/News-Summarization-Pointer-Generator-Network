Their faces show the mixed emotions you might expect in a group of tourists about to embark on a thrilling holiday adventure.

Some smile and wave, while others look apprehensive as they prepare to take to the skies in a balloon over Egypt’s Valley of the Kings.

Minutes later, the craft was to explode and crash to the ground, killing all but two of the 21 people on board.

Video footage emerged yesterday of the preparations for the ill-fated trip, which was recorded by the flight organisers to sell to passengers as a souvenir.

While Mr Rennie and pilot Momen Murad, 
29, were able to leap to safety from 10ft in the air, the balloon then 
lurched to more than 1,000ft.

Everybody else on board, including Mrs 
Rennie, died as they either leapt from the burning craft or perished in 
the blazing wreckage on the ground.

Mr Rennie could only watch the disaster unfold as he screamed ‘My wife, my wife!’

He later described his wife as his ‘rock, my friend, my shoulder to cry on. She was my world’.

The
construction industry worker, who suffered only minor injuries, was due
to fly home yesterday after three nights in a Cairo hospital as 
pictures also emerged alongside the footage.

Standing by the Rennies are London auction valuer Joe Bampton, 40, who 
also died along with his girlfriend Suzanna Gyetvai, 34.

The pair, both artists, were described by their neighbours in Clapham, south London, as ‘a quiet, lovely couple’.

Ahmed Mohamed Al Yemeni, Luxor’s 
deputy public prosecutor  who is in charge of investigating the 
incident, said: ‘Investigators are searching for evidence of a technical
malfunction of a gas canister used.

'It appears likely the gas was 
largely responsible for the accident.’

Mrs Rennie joined the radiology department of Perth Royal Infirmary as an appointments officer in June 2006.

Radiology manager Douglas Mitchell said: ‘We are in shock at the sudden and tragic loss of Yvonne.

‘She
was a much-loved colleague who enjoyed her job and her tragic passing 
has had a huge impact on all of us who knew and worked with her.

'She will be sadly missed.’

Mr Bampton and Miss Gyetvai both worked for Lots Road Auctions in Chelsea.

They were described by their neighbours as ‘a quiet, lovely couple’.

Mr Bampton was originally from Merseyside before moving to London to become an expert valuer of rugs and carpets.

His Hungarian-born partner was also known by her artist name, Zsi Chimera.
