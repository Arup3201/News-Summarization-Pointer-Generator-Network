A horrific night at the movies revealed something far more terrifying than anything on screen, when Brisbane cinema-goers were disgusted to realise they had been sitting on soiled, mouldy seats.

Brisbane resident Aaron Parnell said the stained seats at Event Cinemas Garden City were covered in ‘grime and gunk’ – enough to make his ‘sick to the point of throwing up.’

Images show the discoloured chairs, covered in dust and wet patches. The four friends only became aware of the putrid chairs when the lights came on as the credits rolled after a two and a half hour stint in the seats.

After the movie was over, the four friends realised they had been sitting in the stained, mouldy chairs for two and a half hours at Event Cinemas Garden City

Mr Parnell's partner developed a rash on her arm and they all felt like they needed to 'scrub themselves thoroughly', concerned about what they'd been exposed to

On the Event Cinemas Garden City Facebook page, Mr Parnell explained that his partner had a skin reaction to the seats.

‘I mean it when I say that I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this in a " business establishment ". 

'Upon driving home, my partner developed a rash on her arm and we all had to jump in the shower and scrub ourselves thoroughly after being exposed to that.'

Event Cinemas Garden City replied to the Facebook complaint, explaining that the cinema had been affected by Brisbane's recent rain

The business replied to the post on Facebook, explaining that the cinemas were affected by water damage.  

‘Unfortunately due to the recent rain it seems we have developed some mould affecting some of the seats. Thankyou for bringing this to our attention. We have arranged for a special team of cleaners to rectify this problem today,’ Event Cinemas Garden City wrote in response.

However, Mr Parnell does not believe this excuse is true.

'It is quite obvious to see that this is not the result of anything recent, this has been left over time, excluded and not attended to,’ Mr Parnell wrote.

Mr Parnell argues that the damage is not recent, but has been 'left over time, exclused and not attended to.'

Mr Parnell and his friends took their phones out to photograph the disturbing facilities and posted the images on the cinema's Facebook page, to warn other patrons.

‘In the cinema there was rubbish on the floor, rubbish on the seats, grime and gunk and filth all over the floor, seats and the arm rests. It was disgusting,’ said Aaron Parnell. 

Further inspection of the Facebook page shows similar grievances from more than six months ago, with various cinema goers warning others about the unclean facilities and the ‘sweaty smell.’

‘Bad day at event cinema garden city gold class cinema 1 stank like sweat soon as we walked in the door changed seats 3 times because they also smell very bad and there flithy have they ever been cleaned ? Sure didn't seem like it not sure what the $25 ticket price is meant to cover it sure wasn't a nice time,’ wrote on member of the public.

Facebook posts on the Event Cinemas Garden City Facebook page reveal complaints from patrons from the last six months, expressing their distress at the unclean and 'stinky' state of the facilties.

‘Im sorry to say almost all my visits have been a disappointment due to unclean movie theaters (sic). movies are so expensive these days if you're going to charge so much at least have clean facilities (sic),’ wrote another.

Mr Parnell says it’s time Event Cinemas clean their act up, fearing the health of cinema patrons is at risk. 

'Mould is a big problem, especially with me with me I’m an asthmatic,' Mr Parnell told Courier Mail.

'God knows how many people have come into contact with it.'
