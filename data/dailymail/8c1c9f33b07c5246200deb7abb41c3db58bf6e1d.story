Green protesters have been accused of firing a flare at a police helicopter.

The aircrew said the flare appeared to come from the Barton Moss site, in Salford, police have claimed, but protesters at the camp have denied the claim.

Police claimed the incident, which happened around 12.15pm on Saturday as the helicopter came in to lane at Barton airfield, could have had 'catastrophic' consequences.

Police have said a flare was fired at a police helicopter as it came in to land at a nearby airfield on Saturday

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had executed a search of the site under a warrant issued by a local court.

Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is was an unbelievably stupid act of criminality which was extremely dangerous, not only for the police helicopter, but all other aircraft that use the nearby Barton airfields and the wider public.

'Had this flare caused an emergency situation it would not only have been catastrophic for the aircraft and its crew but potentially for numerous homes near the airfield, the M62 motorway and a childrenâ€™s residential facility.

'The protest camp appears to be a tight knit group who seem to be continually filming anything occurring on Barton Moss Road.

'If one of the protesters is responsible, I suspect their identity will be known to others and I would expect those reasonable members of the anti-fracking campaign to provide any information they have to the police.'

The camp was set up last month after gas company iGas received permission to start exploratory drilling for the controversial extraction process.

Protesters have denied the flare was fired from the camp and said anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave and report themselves to the authorities

Other incidents have seen protesters gluing themselves to gates and chaining themselves to vehicles.

A huge wind turbine blade was also used to block an access road.

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure to blast it open and release gas which is trapped inside.

Campaigners warn it is catastrophic for the environment, including causing earth tremors and contaminating the water supply.

One site in Lancashire was suspended briefly last year after the test drilling caused small earthquakes.

But the government supports exploring the divisive technique, saying it will boost the country's energy supplies at a time of uncertainty.

A statement in August said 'government policy seeks to increase security of supply', adding there was a 'continuing role for gas in the energy mix and support for shale gas exploration'.

The process is only at a test phase in Britain, but has already come under intense scrutiny.

Chief Supt Roberts added: 'An attack on the police of this nature has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not exploratory drilling is right or wrong.

'Whilst I recognise the genuine concerns of many of the protesters in relation to exploratory drilling, it is obvious that there is also an element of regular protesters from outside the Greater Manchester area who seem more interested in seeking confrontation with the police.

'GMP continue to balance facilitating peaceful protest with the rights of others to go about their lawful business, whilst minimising disruption to the local community and businesses.

'Because of the way the camp is set up we have to systematically search the site under a warrant issued by a local court.'

Protesters have denied the flare came from the camp.

Sophie Baxter, spokesman for Frack 
Free Greater Manchester, one of the groups protesting at the camp, 
dismissed the police's claims.

She said: 'The allegations are untrue. The camp has a safe space policy that includes no violence and no aggression.

'Anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave the camp and report themselves to the authorities.'

Fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex when exploratory drilling began last summer

She said it was the second time the police had wrongly accused protesters of firing a flare at a helicopter, the previous occasion being New Year's Eve.

She added: 'It's just an excuse to go into the camp.

'All along the behaviour of Greater Manchester Police has been outrageous.

'They have been really aggressive and removed people's right to protest from them.'

More than 40 per cent of Britain could be opened up for fracking as the hunt for shale gas gathers pace

Sacha Conway, who is currently living at the site, said: 'No flare was fired from this camp on Saturday or any other day.

'We would condem any such action as aggressive, violent and in breach of our very strict safe spaces policy.

'We are peaceful people who wish to stop the destruction of this land by IGas and all of the other fracking companies.'

Rachel
 Thompson, from Frack Free Greater Manchester, said: 'We refute this 
claim. Greater Manchester Police have refused to show any evidence of 
this alleged incident.

'The allegations are untrue. The camp has a safe space policy that includes no violence and no aggression. Anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave the camp and report themselves to the authorities'

'The behaviour of Greater Manchester Police has been outrageous throughout this whole campaign.

'In our eyes this is just another aggressive tactic aimed at isolating the camp from the community and to put them in a bad light.

'We have asked for a meeting with the Police Commissioner, Tony Lloyd to discuss the disgusting behaviour of his officers and have been refused.  This matter is now with our lawyers but we wish to make it clear that we stand by Barton Moss Community Protection Camp and we call for an inquiry into this alleged incident.'
