Misty Copeland managed to dance her way from a childhood spent living in a highway motel with a struggling single mother and five siblings onto the world stage as the second black woman in the history of the American Ballet Theatre to gain the status of soloist.

In her new memoir, Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina, Copeland reveals her improbably jounrney from poverty in San Pedro, California, to the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, according to extracts in the NY Daily News.

Copelandâ€™s mother, Sylvia DelaCerna, had six children she could barely support.

After several marriages and other failed relationships, the family ended up living in at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, a roadside motel neighbored by liquor stores and taco stands.

Now 31, American Ballet Theatre dancer Misty Copeland has experienced a significant rise since first starting ballet at the age of 13

Humble beginnings: Copeland lived with her mother and five siblings at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, a suburb of LA, when she was first discovered as a dancer

At the age of 13, Copeland was discovered on a basketball court at a local Boys & Girls Club of America by Cynthia Bradley, a former dancer and instructor who was starting a program with the club to bring in students on full scholarship who might not be exposed to classical ballet.

Copeland was selected to be one of them and, despite being at a late age to start dancing, proved herself to be a natural.

She was a fast learner and could execute movements without difficult or hesitation.

Bradley became so close to Copeland during their tutelage that she brought her protege to live with her, with Copeland returning to her mother on weekends.

However the arrangement ended in a sensational court battle in 1998 after Copeland filed for legal emancipation from DelaCerna so she could live permanently with Bradley.

DelaCerna accused Bradley of brainwashing Copeland and successfully fought to regain custody of her daughter.

Despite the legal drama, Copeland was signed to the American Ballet company as a student at the age of 17.

But as her body matured, she was told her curves distracted from the classical line a ballerina should present.

She was told her body needed 'lengthening', which is ballet speak for losing weight.

Adding to the adversity was her growing awareness that many in ballet didn't welcome a brown.

However at 19-years-old she was signed to the company full-time through sheer determination and hard work.

'ABT, seeing how hard I had worked, how well I was performing, eventually stopped asking me to lengthen,' she wrote in her book.

'They came to see things my way, that my curves are part of who I am as a dancer, not something I need to lose to become one.'

Misty Copeland's memoir is a about how she battled poverty and racial bias to dance her way to the top

Copeland went on to perform with Prince and TLC, appear in commercials for Coach and Dr. Pepper and develop her own line of sportswear.

However she considers her biggest achievement to date as becoming first black woman to ever play the Firebird, which she did in 2012.

Making the performance even more triumphant was the fact she did it on a leg riddled with stress fractures that dealt her unbearable pain.

'I was transformed. For the next ninety minutes, I fluttered and darted. I was the Firebird,' she wrote.

And I felt no pain. All the training, all the practicing, all the nurturing had come together for this climactic moment.

'They were all there with me, everyone who had sustained me. And so many more.

'This is for the little brown girls.'
