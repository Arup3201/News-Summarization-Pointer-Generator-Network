Multi-millionaire footballer Jamie O'Hara sparked a Twitter fury earlier today after he wrote on the social networking site about his hard life as a professional footballer.

The Wolverhampton Wanderers player - who is thought to be paid about £35,000 a week - posted a tweet where he appeared to bemoan his life situation, longing for 'easier' days on £100 a week.

Jamie O'Hara, 26, who married former Miss England Danielle Lloyd, 28, in a lavish ceremony in May, wrote: ‘Things were so much easier when I earned 100pound a week on wts #stress’.

The tweet referred to his days on the Youth Training Scheme, and it did not take long before his followers' angry reactions came flooding in.

And after an angry backlash from followers, he caused even more fury by hitting back with: ‘Why do people think cos I earn good money I don't have bills to pay we all pay tax an we have mortgages to pay, some people are deluded.’

Dozens of people bombarded Twitter with mocking tweets, accusing the footballer of being out of touch with the lives of ordinary people.

Christian Wainwright tweeted: 'Feel sorry for Jamie O'Hara, must be so stressful doing a few training sessions and playing 2 games a week for £1000s a week. #getagrip.'

Meanwhile Nick Daniels tweeted: ‘Must be so hard being Jamie O'Hara , great career, beautiful wife, nice family, rich, Saturdays off and still he is stressed! #prayforjamie.'

Defence: The torrent of hateful tweets saw Mr O'Hara post further messages defending his original one

And Graeme Wallace tweeted: ‘Wish I had a hard life like professional footballer Jamie O'Hara.’

But O'Hara, who has two children 
Archie, two, and Harry, one, with his wife Danielle hit back with 
references to his charity work.

He tweeted: ‘I wonder how many people are
doing hospital visits this Xmas or giving clothing to the homeless this
winter, or setting up a charity to raise money for hospitals Southey 
can buy equipment that save people lives, u can talk on here but what 
are YOU doing.’

But his tweet further angered Twitter users who called him a spoiled millionaire.

Aaron Ingham tweeted: ‘I see Jamie O'Hara's banging on about how charitable he is....after his disgusting tweet about life being easier when he earned £100 a week.’

Later O'Hara continued his rant, 
tweeting: ‘I'm not saying I'm not privileged I'm so lucky to have what 
I've got but trust me when I was 17 on wts it was a lot more easier.

‘Many peeps hating about me earning good
money that show how jealous u are, instead of realising the tweet was 
about how hard life gets.’

Mr O'Hara posted that he wished he could reveal to his followers the real reason behind the original tweet but that there were 'too many a******** on twitter' and that 'people should worry about their own lives'.

The midfielder has been injured and unable to play for his team since August but returned to full training yesterday.

In July O'Hara was involved in a Twitter spat with Leon Knight after the ex-Chelsea player called his wife a ‘raging s**t bag’.

His own words: Jamie O'Haras twitter biography where he describes himself as a hard worker who will never 'forget where I've come from'

Enraged O'Hara retaliated: ‘If at @leonknight82 has got a problem he should give me a call instead of giving the bigun on twitter to a women with two kids.

‘And follow me and I'll direct message you my number, anytime mate, your a disgrace to your name go and do something with your life.’

Wolverhampton Wanderers FC was contacted by MailOnline but declined to comment.
