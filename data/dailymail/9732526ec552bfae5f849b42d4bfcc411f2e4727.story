Labour Health Secretary: Andy Burnham was sent a list of hospitals that recorded suspiciously high death rates but did nothing about the information, said Sir Brian Jarman

More than 20,000 deaths in NHS hospitals could have been prevented if Ministers had not ignored repeated warnings about high mortality rates, a leading health adviser has claimed.

Professor Sir Brian Jarman, director of the Dr Foster research unit which monitors death rates, has revealed that in 2010 he sent the then Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, a list of hospitals which had recorded suspiciously high numbers of deaths. However, he says, no action was taken.

Many of those hospitals are among the
14 now subject to an urgent Government review in the wake of the 
Stafford Hospital scandal.

Sir
Brian said his figures – separate from Government data – revealed that 
as many as 20,000 patients may have died unnecessarily at the 14 trusts 
involved in the review. 

Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme 
yesterday, Sir Brian said Mr Burnham told him he had passed the 
information to the hospitals regulator, the Care Quality Commission – 
but that the regulator ‘did not find that there was anything to worry 
them’.

He added: ‘It’s a pity they didn’t 
because, as we have seen at Mid Staffs and other hospitals, when they 
have actually gone in and looked, they have been able to reduce the 
death rates.’ Sir Brian suggested the review should be widened.

Warning: Sir Brian Jarman said that he passed his study to the hospitals regulator, which ¿did not find that there was anything to worry them¿

He said: ‘It’s only looking at 14 of the 140 trusts – there are likely to be others where they have numbers that exceed the national value. I think there must be at least tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.’ 

The review follows the publication of a highly critical report into appalling care standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust.

Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 as nurses and doctors were put under pressure to put targets ahead of basic patient care.

Sir Brian also repeated his call for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to stand down over  the revelations.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘I think he should go. He represents everything that’s wrong with the NHS at the moment.’

Mr Burnham, who was Health Secretary between June 2009 and May 2010, insisted he took action when Sir Brian contacted him.

Now Shadow Health Secretary, Mr Burnham said: ‘I passed the data to the independent regulator and

I also invited Brian Jarman on to a working party to look at this very issue.’
