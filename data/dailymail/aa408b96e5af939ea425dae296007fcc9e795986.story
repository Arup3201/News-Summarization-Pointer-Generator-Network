These  images show the disgusting squalor of a pensioner's flat where 31 cats were kept in such appalling conditions that many were seriously ill with cat flu.

Carol Sheridan, 67, kept the 15 kittens and 16 cats in 'extremely unsuitable' conditions at her home in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester.

She was taken to court by the RSPCA after a raid on her home, which discovered 16 of the animals were suffering from the respiratory disease, but had not been taken to the vet.

Filthy: These images show the disgusting squalor of a pensioner's flat where 31 cats were kept in such appalling conditions that many were seriously ill with cat flu

Carol Sheridan, 67, kept the animals in filthy conditions in her flat in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, including having no electricity or running hot water

One cat even had an eye condition because of the illness.

Images released by the RSPCA show the horrific conditions in the flat, which had no electricity or running hot water.

All the animals were taken into care by the RSPCA after they were found, but it was said to have cost the charity thousands of pounds to give them the appropriate treatment.

The pensioner, who lived alone in the £90,000 home, has now been banned from keeping any animal as a pet for five years.

A total of 16 pets were said to be suffering from the respiratory disease, but had not been taken to the vet

The RSPCA has since spent thousands of pounds caring for and re-homing the animals  

There are still believed to be five cats in the pensioner's home. One cat (right) even had an eye condition because of the flu

Sheridan (pictured) was found guilty at trial of two charges under the Animal Welfare Act 

She initially denied two charges under the Animal Welfare Act but was found guilty by a district judge after a trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

Sheridan, who is in receipt of benefits, was ordered to surrender ownership of the cats, along with five others still thought to be at the address.

She was also sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work and must also pay £330 costs.  

David McCormick, prosecuting, said it has cost the RSPCA thousands of pounds to look after and care for the cats after they were removed.

Some already have new homes, and others are in the process of being rehomed, he added. 

Mr McCormick said: 'It would be in the defendant's own best interests if a ban was imposed. Fourteen of the cats are still in the society's protection.'

The court heard Sheridan was an 'animal lover' who started caring for other people's cats, but had soon become 'overwhelmed' with the number. 

The court Sheridan has no previous convictions and does some charity work.

John Mitchell, defending, said: 'She is a lady aside from this of previous good character.

Sheridan, who is in receipt of benefits, must also surrender ownership of the cats, along with five others still thought to be at her flat (pictured) 

'This is a lady who is an animal lover. She tells me that her animals are her life.'

District Judge Mark Hadfield said he accepted that Sheridan had the best interests of the cats at heart but that the number involved had 'overwhelmed her'.

He said the house had no electricity or hot running water and added: 'It was clearly filthy. The conditions in your home were appalling, even for you.'

Speaking after the case, a RSPCA spokesman urged anyone with an ill pet to seek immediate veterinary care or contact the charity.
