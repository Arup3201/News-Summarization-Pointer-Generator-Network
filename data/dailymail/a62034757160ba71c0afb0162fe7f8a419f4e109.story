They say the apple never falls far from the tree. And it's clear from stunning photos of Georgia May Jagger posing for the Fashion Targets Breast Cancer poster campaign that she's inherited all of her mother's good looks - and more.

The 18-year-old daughter of Jerry Hall and Mick Jagger has teamed up with Pixie Geldof to help launch a nationwide campaign to battle breast cancer - the same cause for which Jerry Hall posed in lingerie and a T-shirt six years ago.

The pair are supporting this year's Fashion Targets Breast Cancer campaign, a nationwide initiative that set to run for six weeks to raise funds for charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer through the sale of products including clothing, accessories and other items from high street chains including M&S, Laura Ashley and Debenhams.

The drive, started by Ralph Lauren in 1994, aims to unite the fashion world to help fight the disease and this year M&S, River Island, Warehouse, Topshop, Coast, Laura Ashley, Daisy Jewellery, my-wardrobe.com, Debenhams and Shavata have designed pieces for the collection.

The items, which have a best of British theme, tying in with the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee, range from £2 to £150 and all carry a minimum 30% donation, organisers said.

Pixie Geldof: 'Join me in saying "Buy It. Fight It. Wear Your Support"'

Georgia May Jagger, whose supermodel mother Jerry Hall fronted the campaign for the 10-year anniversary in 2006, said: 'Every year Fashion Targets Breast Cancer brings women and fashion together for this vitally important cause, and I'm thrilled to be part of it.

'I'd love every woman to join me - Buy It. Fight It. Wear Your Support!'

Pixie Geldof added: 'Fashion Targets Breast Cancer is all about British retailers and British women standing together in the fight against breast cancer.

'Check out the collection at www.fashiontargetsbreastcancer.org.uk. Join me in saying "Buy It. Fight It. Wear Your Support!"'
