This is the moment two giggling girls danced with death as they peaked over a clifftop amid treacherous gales.

The tourists were captured posing for photos and jumping around barely a metre from the crumbling edge of the Birling Gap in East Sussex just days after a neighbouring cliff collapsed into the sea.

Coastguards have now closed access to the beach and warned visitors of a significant risk to life.

But the women weren't alone as dozens of families were today captured hiking up to the perilous summit despite numerous safety warnings during the stormiest winter since 1969.

Stupid? Two tourists creep towards the crumbling edge of the clifftop in East Sussex despite numerous safety warnings from the Met Office and the coastguards

Just along the clifftop - locally dubbed the 'Seven Sisters' for its seven peaks - three semi-detached homes are on the brink of tumbling into the English Channel.

Nonetheless, the walkers calmly gazed at the lashing waves below.

It is the latest in a number of stunts branded 'idiotic' by the RNLI during the stormiest December since 1969.

Floods have left all access roads to Muchelney under 3ft of water for four days, and Dorset residents have been warned imminent floods pose a 'significant risk to life'.

The Met Office issued a 'be aware' yellow warning for gusts as strong as 70mph set to hit the west and south-west coast of Britain today.

On Saturday, the RNLI were called to rescue 21-year-old student Edward Laxton who was trapped on a jetty in Aberystwyth, Wales, after taking photographs of the ferocious waves.

An inshore rescue team launched and rescued the first year Aberystwyth University student from the end of the platform.

Pictures show the solitary figure standing at the far end of the pier as the water threatens to engulf him.

Video taken by a passer-buy shows the waves have cut the man off from the shore and he is stranded at the end of the jetty.

Rescue crews used their dinghy to get close to the him then strapped a lifejacket on him and brought him ashore.

Not alone: The girls were followed by numerous country walkers who hiked up to the summit. This group gazes calmly over the blustering wind at a house about to fall

Despite repeated warnings to the public to stay away from the coastline, the man had walked to the end of the wooden jetty got get shots of the waves crashing over him and onto the street.

But the fierce weather left him stranded.

Police and coastguard teams were unable to reach the man, and the Aberystwyth RNLI 85 Class lifeboat 'Spirit of Friendship' was launched to assist, reaching the man from the sheltered lee of the harbour.

A young father and his daughter came perilously close to being swept away this morning as they bounded towards 15ft-high waves on the sea edge in Cornwall.

Perranport, near Newquay, has one of the worst-hit parts of Britain this week, with some of the biggest waves in a decade swamping the town.

But a breathtaking video captured a young family standing on the sea front as the wind and water raged.Â

The scene was caught on video by local Mark Thomas who was stunned when he saw a man edging closer to the edge with what appeared to be his daughter aged around six or seven.

Another man can be seen standing right on the edge of a slipway as an enormous wall of water over 15ft-high is thrown up just feet away.

It is the stormiest winter to hit the UK since 1969 and depression from the Atlantic coupled with 70mph winds has caused mayhem in Cornwall.

The pair, with another man, were dressed to brave the waves in the far south west of the UK, where storms have led to numerous emergency rescue missions

Footage captured this morning shows the group advancing towards a ramp down into the water as the waves crash higher
