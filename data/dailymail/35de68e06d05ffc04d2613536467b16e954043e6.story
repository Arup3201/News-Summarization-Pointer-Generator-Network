Gwyneth Paltrow has had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of a fundraiser that the actress is holding for the president on Thursday evening.

The signs, including one featuring an image of Paltrow with the phrase 'Obama drone' on it, are the work of an artist called Sabo who creates street art with a clear Republican slant under the name Unsavoryagents.

The 42-year old actress got full view of the posters as she arrived home on Wednesday. They’ve been plastered to electricity boxes and hung over the road for everyone to see around her upscale neighborhood of Mandeville Canyon, Brentwood.

Happy to be home? The actress didn't look best pleased to discover that her L.A. home has been surrounded by highly critical posters of her and President Obama

Another poster depicts an image of the President that has been ripped down the middle to separate him from the American flag and features Gwyneth's infamous phrase 'conscious uncoupling' on it.

The @unsavoryagents Twitter account tweeted a picture of the Paltrow poster earlier this month along with the text: 'Party at Paltrow's place!!! God I wish we would do somethign to shut this thing down.' 

On Tuesday Sabo also tweeted that he was seeking ‘a face painter who’s willing to work for free ASAP for the Paltrow project.’

A section of Sunset Boulevard will be closed for Thursday's high-profile event, which is slated to attract some of the entertainment industry’s most prominent names.

President Obama boards Air Force One prior to departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to  travel on a three-day trip to California for economic events and to attend fundraisers such as that being held by Paltrow

The President was pictured leaving the White House earlier on Thursday to fly to California. He is scheduled to spend the next three days in the state attending economic events and Democratic National Committee fundraisers. 

Ticket prices for the event at Paltrow's home range from $1,000 to over $32,000.

Sabo’s art is reminiscent of acclaimed street artist Banksy and Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster, although Unsavoryagents’ artwork has a very clear Republican message.

For the last 15 years, the L.A-based artist says he has been creating works in an effort to be 'the other voice.'

'The left is constantly telling people that anyone (who is not left) is bigoted or misogynist,' he told Fox News. 'All of the voices (at art school) are leftist… The Republicans have a great story with no one to tell it.'

Statement: The posters have been put up to coincide with a Democratic fundraiser happening at Paltrow's place on Thursday

According to the Unsavory Agents Facebook page, the company’s mission is not only to 'let the art world know that the left-wing will no longer hold art hostage' but to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts.'

'Our art is politically minded, right-wing centric, brutal, street level, and hard edge,' the page reads. 'Our means are achieved by any creative means necessary.'

Previous targets have included Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin.

Paltrow is a long-standing Democrat supporter and was even an active member of Democrats Abroad when she lived in London with ex-husband Chris Martin.

She previously hosted a re-election fundraiser for Obama in 2012. 

Is this Sabo? According to his Facebook page his mission is to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts'
