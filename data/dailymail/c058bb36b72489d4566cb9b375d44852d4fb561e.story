The last thing you want when transporting a dead body is to do yourself an injury.

And now, Britain's only tandem bicycle hearse has
gone on sale... because its owner fears it could seriously damage his
health.

Reverend Paul Sinclair, 46, of Motorcycle Funerals
created the unique mode of funereal transport but found he was not fit enough
to operate it.

The company's faster alternative transport services include a Harley Davidson, Suzuki Hayabusa and Triumph - all with hearse sidecars - for motorcycle enthusiasts.

Now Rev Sinclair and his wife Marian, 46, are
selling the tandem as a going concern and inviting offers in excess of £2,250.

Ideally, they would love to keep it but have struggled to find local people willing to take up the job on a casual basis - and they don't want it to end up in a museum.

The reverend said: 'We're simply not fit enough to
ride it. We are bikers, not cyclists.

'It's seen some lovely funerals but we're
always wrecked afterwards.

The tandem hearse cost £2,250 to develop and build and will be on view as part of Return to Sender - a special zone at the Christian Resources Exhibition in Exeter, Devon, covering bereavement services and the church. Also pictured is one of the company's motorcycle hearses

'We beg people who book it not to go too far - we even have to ask if the cemetery is at
the top or bottom of a hill.'

At one church, St Petroc's in South Brent,
Devon, the tandem was ridden right down the aisle to the front of the church.

And at the end of the service, the cycle-loving
deceased was pedalled out of the church to his final resting place.

'We used a sidecar racing engineer to do
it,' explained Paul. 

'It
is so strong, we could fit it to a motorbike.'
