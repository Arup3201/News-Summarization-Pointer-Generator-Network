Horrifying: Dwayne Ward, 17, is fighting for his life following the attack in Turkey

A British teenager is still fighting for his life 
after he was stripped naked and 'stabbed 17 times' for kissing a local girl in a Turkish bar.

Dwayne Ward, 17, was found soaked in blood in a garden in the Tepe district of Marmaris, by locals after a night out with his older brother on Tuesday. 

A police report revealed Dwayne said: 'I was having fun while I was out and I kissed a Turkish girl at the bar I was in.'

'I went to another bar and that was when they hit me in the head with a hard object.'

He then added, according to The Sun: 'I don't remember the rest.'

The teenager, from Middlesbrough, Cleveland, was on holiday with his brother Darren, 32, and their mother Doris. 

He was found at 7.30am with injuries including cuts to the throat, chest, groin, legs and back.

The teenager was taken to the intensive care unit of the Marmaris State Hospital - he is reportedly in a critical condition.

Attila Dincer, 26, who works cleaning 
cars in the area near to where Dwayne was found, is now being questioned in 
relation to the incident.

He was arrested in the early hours of
 Thursday morning and shortly after Ismail A, 24, from Aksaray, was 
arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles away.

Using information believed to have 
come from Dincer, Turkish police in Mugla liased with other forces 
across the country - tracking Ismail on a bus heading for his home town.

Ismail was taken from the bus at Konya and is being transferred back to Marmaris to undergo questioning.

Marmaris police immediately launched a major investigation into the 
alleged attack andall leave was cancelled as they desperately tried to track down the attackers.

Within 48 hours police had checked 217 cameras covering the town's Bar Street and surrounding areas.

Careful
 examination of the camera's showed Dwayne leaving Bar Street and then a
 few hundred yards further on two men were seen following him and taking
 hold of his arms.

According
 to police and hospital reports Dwayne had been stabbed more than a 
dozen times including twice in the throat and several times in the 
chest. It is said to have pierced his heart.

It is said he had also been stabbed in the groin, legs and back and his arms had been slashed with a razor.

Today family and friends today spoke of their horror after the 'quiet, decent' football-loving teen was attacked.

Carolyn Ward, a relative of Dwayne's,
 said: 'It has been a massive shock to the family, his dad Wayne is due 
to fly out out to Turkey soon.

'From what we understand his 
condition has improved slightly and we are hoping that proves to be the 
case. He's such a nice, quiet young lad, it's hard to believe he's been 
set on like this.'

Dwayne's uncle, Vincent Ward said: 'It's hit everyone very hard, his Dad's in bits about it but is going out there tomorrow.'

Wayne Hand, 17, a former school friend at Middlesbrough's Macmillan Academy, which Dwayne left last year.

Wayne said: 'He's a really nice genuine lad and definitely not the sort to go looking for trouble.

'If he got into bother it will have come to him because he's just not one of those people who invites it.

At school he was quiet and well liked.

'After leaving MacMillan he moved on 
to Middlesbrough College and that's where he's studying now, I think 
it's something sports based.

'He's a good footballer and loves 
sport of all kinds. There have been loads of people on Twitter and 
Facebook this morning talking about him as word has spread of what's 
happened.

'He's a very popular lad and we're all totally shocked. We just want to see him him recovered and home as soon as possible.'

Neighbours at the family's neat semi 
detached home were also shocked by the news that Dwayne had been left 
fighting for his life.

One neighbour said: 'He is a 
respectable, decent lad from a nice family. He is certainly not the sort
 of kid who would have gone looking for trouble.

'He spent most of his time kicking a football around at the back of the house either on his own or with his mates.

People on Belcekiz beach called paramedics after noticing that a body, believed to be that of Anthony Gissing, was floating in the sea without moving

The attack took place after the young 
man and his older brother, had been out drinking in the 
town's Bar Street on Monday night.

The brothers had reportedly become separated among the crowds and Darren had returned to their hotel alone.

The
 brothers are believed to be on holiday with their mother- staying at 
the privately run Ali Baba Otel close to the town's busy market place.

Speaking
 from the Ali Baba Otel, yesterday morning his mother said: 'Dwayne's 
facing another operation this morning. His dad's flying out from the UK 
to be with him.

'I'm too distressed to talk about it.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed hospitalisation of the teenager.
