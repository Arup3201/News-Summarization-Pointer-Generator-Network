Peter Fincham has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers

He is the first to admit he is guilty of being besotted with chasing a youth audience. 

But ITV executive Peter Fincham has now confessed ‘the simple truth, not be resisted’.

It is the older age group who drive viewing figures and they need to be given programmes they have an appetite for.

From the BBC’s hit drama Last Tango in Halifax, a love story between elderly Celia and Alan, played by Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, to the box office smash hit film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which tells the tale of pensioners looking for a warm place in India to retire, are recent examples of the tremendous value of the Grey vote. 

Now ITV is to follow suit with the launch of it’s new family entertainment show Amazing Greys which will be hosted by 69-year-old veteran presenter Angela Rippon. 

The programme will see young contestants take on some of the country’s most talented pensioners and the decision to commission the show is a reflection of how important it now is to TV bosses that they are seen to embrace older viewers. 

A point not lost on Mr Fincham as the director of programmes for ITV he is regarded as the arbiter of what the nation views and has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers. 

In an interview for the Radio Times he said: ‘The simple truth, not to be resisted is that as people go through life they watch more television. There’s no point in swimming against the tide. So we make programmes that appeal to that audience – though not at the expense of others. ‘

Mr Fincham admits there was a point when television was once fixated with youth.

He said: ‘It looked as if it was the way TV was going. But it was never going that way, to be absolutely honest. And all those people who watched yoof TV  - an expression you never hear these days – are probably watching gardening programmes now because they are no longer young.’

According to statistics most of the people (54 per cent) watching BBC1 are over 55. BBC2’s audience is even older – 59 per cent over 55. ITV1 is broadly the same, though they are less public with their figures.

Mr Fincham’s views are echoed by presenter Michael Burke. 

The former newsreader said he had also noticed a turn in the tide for elderly presenters and stars. 

He said: ‘Older presenters were cut down in droves, much as you would prune the raspberries to make way for new growth. Fair enough, in my view, though many cried "Ageism!" and several went to tribunals.

ITV is to launch a new family quiz show Amazing Greys which will be hosted by 69-year-old veteran presenter Angela Rippon

'Presenter, in any case, is a very recent job description dreamt up to describe somebody who fronts a programme without any special reason for being on it.

'And if you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can’t see why you should keep it when you don’t.

'As the wonderfully acerbic Anne Robinson said, "The viewers don’t want to watch ugly.

'She seemed to say it through gritted teeth, or at least a flawless but strangely taut face – a sign perhaps that she had taken her own advice to stop complaining and work on staying attractive.

'But now – again suddenly, again when I was looking the other way – the media worm has turned. We’re trendy – sorry, cool – again. 

‘Mary Berry, 79, is the new Jamie Oliver, David Dimbleby, 75, will front the next election for the BBC in preference to the not-so-young pretender Huw Edwards, 52, and I defy you to switch on any programme, on any channel, without coming face to face with Angela Rippon, 69.

'The old faces are back on TV, and not because they’re facing historical sex offence charges.’

'It’s turned around on a sixpence,' sayS Sue Ayton, the veteran agent with many of those older faces, as well as quite a few young ones, on her books.

'A couple of years ago, if you went in with an idea for a show with older presenters aimed at older people, they would laugh like hyenas and show you the door. Now that’s all changed. They’ve realised they’ve been ruling out programmes people want to watch.'

Miss Rippon, one of her clients, agrees: 'I wake up every morning thinking how extraordinary it is – to be 69 and still working on TV.

'Television has at last realised you need maturity and experience alongside youth and beauty. It’s finally come of age.'
