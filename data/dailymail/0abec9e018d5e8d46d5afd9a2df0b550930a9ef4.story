A family brawl that broke out between neighbors in Oak Hill, Florida on Sunday ended with one man being bitten not just by a pit bull, but also by the dog's owner.

Volusia County sheriffs say that Peter Lynch and his wife Kelly were on one side of the scuffle with their 60-year-old neighbor John Hendry, his daughter Jessica and their 1-year-old pit bull Ellie May on the other.

By the end of it, the women were at each others throats down on the ground and both Mr. Hendry and Ellie May had sunk their teeth into Mr. Lynch's flesh.

According to the News-Journal Online, it all began with the dog.

Mr. Lynch, 52, claimed to police he was out playing basketball with his sons when the ball was stuck in a tree at the edge of the Hendry's property.

When the boys went to retrieve it, they say Ellie May appeared and came charging at them aggressively.

Mr. Lynch then kicked the canine and told the boys to run away.

Responding to what she said were Ellie May's screams, Jessica Hendry, 29, approached Lynch and told him to back off her dog.

According to the blow-by-blow police report, Hendry then struck Lynch in the head.

As Lynch shoved the woman to the ground, two things happened: John Hendry emerged to defend his daughter and Kelly Lynch, 44, came from her home to come to her husband's aid.

Mutual injuries described by police 
indicate that the women scratched at one another and wrestled on the 
ground as the two men came to blows, as well.

Ellie May stood by, police say, and became progressively agitated.

But before the dog could bite Lynch, Mr. Hendry allegedly did it for him.

Ellie May followed suit and at one point Hendry's teeth were in Lynch's hand as the canine's were in his leg.

After Lynch dislodged both attackers, he called 911.

However,
 notes the News-Journal, the dispatcher had to ask to speak to Mrs. 
Lynch after she was unable to understand the situation through Mr. 
Lynch's loud obscenities.

'I'm
 bleeding to death,' he screamed as Mrs. Lynch took the phone and 
explained that it was, in fact, the second time her husband had been 
bitten by the dog.

Police arrived to find all parties seething but none had serious injuries.

'The only time she’s ever bitten him is when he was fighting with me,' Hendry maintained. 'She’s a sweet dog.

'That
 guy next door is always standing outside yelling at people who drive 
by. He yells at his wife and his children. It’s terrible.'

However, after questioning, it was the Hendrys who went to jail.

John Hendry was charged with one count of battery causing bodily harm, while Jessica was charged with two.

They were both out on bail by early Monday.
