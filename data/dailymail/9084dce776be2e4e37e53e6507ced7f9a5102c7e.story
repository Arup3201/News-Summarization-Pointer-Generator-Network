The Prime Minister was yesterday accused of preventing his deputy from cracking down on moves to open pubs on motorways.

Nick Clegg is backing a move by Liberal Democrat Home Office Minister Norman Baker to close a loophole in the law which allows pubs on some major routes.

But Lib Dem sources say David Cameron is vetoing the measure – even though Home Secretary Theresa May and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin have given it the green light.

David Cameron has been accused of blocking moves to stop pubs from opening on major routes, like the Weatherspoon pub on the M40 in Buckinghamshire

JD Wetherspoon opened the first motorway pub at Beaconsfield services on the M40 in Buckinghamshire in January and it is believed more are planned by other companies.

As the Minister responsible for alcohol, Mr Baker is determined to stop them, but Lib Dem sources say No 10 has indicated it will veto the plan.

Mr Baker told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘We have made good strides over the years in tackling drink- driving, but we can’t afford  to send out a message that implies drinking and driving is in any way acceptable.

‘Legislation introduced in 2003 was meant to ban pubs on the motorway network, but it doesn’t affect private land.

‘This anomaly was highlighted by the heavily criticised decision of JD Wetherspoon to open a pub on the M40. I am keen to close this loophole, but it is being blocked by Conservatives at the centre of Government.’

A Lib Dem source said: ‘It has been made clear to us that Cameron will not allow this.

‘His intervention seems extraordinary after neither May nor McLoughlin ex-pressed any opposition.

‘It is well known that the drinks companies have been long-time supporters and donors to the Conservative Party. Road safety is far  more important.’

JD Wetherspoon’s decision to open the Hope and Champion pub was attacked by road safety charity Brake.

It said motorway pubs were a ‘dangerous temptation’ for drivers, while the RAC claims surveys show motorists are against them.

However, others said it was no different from pubs on main roads.

Last month, the prospect of a network of motorway pubs appeared to move closer when roadside services chain Roadchef, which runs services at 20 sites, said it was considering launching its own pub.

A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon said that although sales at the Hope and Champion were strong, alcohol accounted for less than 20 per cent of takings.

He added there were no current plans to open more.

In April, the Prime Minister over-ruled Mr Baker’s plan to refuse to let pubs stay open late so drinkers could watch England’s World Cup match against Italy.
