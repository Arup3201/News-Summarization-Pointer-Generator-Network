A fast food chain has been forced to apologise for a franchise’s ‘racist’ sign referring to the Washington Redskins being ‘scalped and sent to a reservation’.

The sign, referring to a football game between the Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs read: ‘'KC CHIEFS' WILL SCALP THE REDSKINS FEED THEM WHISKEY SEND - 2 - RESERVATION’

A photograph of the signboard outside a Sonic Drive-in in Belton, Missouri, was posted on Twitter and it did not take long before the storm was in motion.

'Racist sign': The sign, referring to a football game between the Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs, was put up outside a Sonic Drive-in in Belton, Missouri

The sign outside the Sonic Drive-in built was condemned as 'shockingly racist' and 'hateful,' by a professor at Columbia University, while others took to Twitter to air their views.

‘A Sonic in Missouri is run by racist idiots? You don't say,’ tweeted user Chet G, as another wrote: ‘Disgusting. Well another restaurant just hit my "do NOT eat there" list.'

Several others vowed not to return to the fast food chain as a result of the sign.

Sonic Drive-in was quick to apologise 
for the sign, which was swiftly taken down, tweeting: ‘Please know that 
the sign posted today is something we do not condone, and we are so 
sorry for how it has hurt so many.

And
 added: ‘The racist remarks on the sign at that 1 drive-in were beyond 
wrong & NOT a part of our brand values. So sorry for hurt caused.’

Sorry: Management at Sonic Drive-in immediately apologized for the sign and took it down from outside the franchise

Controversial: The Washington Redskins's name and logo has long been deemed racist and offensive, but the club's boss has vowed 'never' to change it

A company representative explained that the sign was put up by a ‘creative’ employee, and that the sign was in ‘poor taste’

'The remarks posted on this message board were wrong, offensive and unacceptable,’ Patrick Lenow, vice president of public relations at Sonic, told NBC News

'In a misguided effort to support his football team an independent franchise owner allowed passion to override good judgment.

'The owner has reinforced with his employees the boundaries of what is acceptable and unacceptable. On behalf of the franchise owner and our entire brand we apologize for the offensive remarks.'

Washington Redskins have long been 
embroiled in a battle with Native American organisations who claim the 
name 'Redskins' and the team’s logo are racist and offensive.

Just
 days ago, 61 faith leaders in the Washington area signed a letter 
urging the owner of the football team Dan Snyder to change the name as 
'redskin' is seen as a derogatory term.

Sunday, the Washington Redskins lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in Landover, Maryland. Dan Snyder has said he will ‘never’ change the name of the team which he sees as a ‘badge of honour’.
