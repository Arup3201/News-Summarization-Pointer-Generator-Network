A New York City club for Republican women is being torn apart by a vitriolic fight after one member accused of board member of saying 'we don't want' lesbians at the exclusive 95-year-old league.

Marilyn Thomas sent an email to the 1,000 members of the  Women's National Republican Club accusing 72-year-old Irene Marmott of scoffing at the membership of lesbian Republicans.

According to Page Six, Ms Thomas accuses Mrs Marmott of declaring: 'We obviously can’t say that but, of course, we don’t want them here.'

The Manhattan club was founded by suffragists in 1921 as a way to educate female voters 

Mrs Marmott denies making the remark. A lawyer for the club told the Post: 'She has no recollection of saying anything that could be construed as inappropriate.'

The club on West 51st Street in Manhattan, charges at $544 initiation fee and $822 a year in dues. 

Founded in 1921 as a suffragist organization to educate female voters, it lists former First Ladies Barbara Bush, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan as honorary members - though it refers to them on its website as Mrs George H.W. Bush, Mrs George W. Bush and Mrs Ronald Reagan.

Ms Thomas, who works in film, also says Mrs Marmott had scorn for Republican commentator Margaret Hoover, a frequent speaker at the club who is also a prominent gay rights proponent within the GOP.

'Irene said that she had no idea that Margaret was "wrapped up in something like that,'" according to the email. 

Club dues are $822 a year and the initiation fee is $544. The club on West 51st Street has frequent speakers, a bar and a hotel

Club officials say that the organization is open to all and that there are currently lesbians members. Men are allowed to join as associate members

Ms Thomas called on Mrs Marmott to apologize and resign from the board.  

The Women's National Republican Club says it has no policy - in fact or in deed - to discriminate against lesbians - or anyone else. 

'This club has been in existence for 90 years and welcomes people regardless of creed, color and sexual orientation. We have members who are gay,' Daniel W. Isaacs, the attorney for the organization, told the Post. 

Men are allowed to join the club as non-voting associate members.  

Mrs Marmott did not immediately return calls from Daily Mail Online seeking comment.
