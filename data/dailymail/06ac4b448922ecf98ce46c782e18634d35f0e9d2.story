Most Britons have ‘lost any real connection with the land’ and many are ‘increasingly suspicious’ about farming, Prince Charles has warned.

While people still treasured the countryside, he said, they should not take it for granted or benefits such as landscapes and local food could be lost.

In a foreword for Country Life magazine to mark his 66th birthday this week, the prince wrote: ‘Unlike in most parts of the continent of Europe, many people in the UK are now four or more generations removed from anyone who actually worked on the land – and it frequently shows in their attitudes.

The Prince of Wales, who says that many Britons have lost any real connection with the land'. He was pictured last night visiting an exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London 

The Prince urged people to value and protect the countryside or risk losing its landscapes and local foods forever 

‘They have only a vague understanding of what farming is or does; and – as outsiders looking in – they are increasingly suspicious of it.’

On a more positive note, however, he maintained that people still treasured the countryside and urged them to value and protect it or risk losing its landscapes, farmers, village pubs and local foods forever.

The prince wrote: ‘One of the things that strikes me most forcibly is the extent to which the majority of the population has lost any real connection with the land.'

Charles also warned that if people continue to take the countryside for granted the nation risks losing an irreplaceable part of its landscape, community and economy.

Charles also warned that if people continue to to take the countryside for granted, it would affect the economy 

He added: ‘The rich, natural tapestry that is the countryside we value so highly does not just happen by itself. But that delicately woven tapestry is facing unprecedented challenges.

‘Start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed, and is very difficult to put back again - no farmers, no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls; no thriving rural communities, no villages - or village pubs; no local markets, no distinctive local foods ... Somehow, we need to find a way to put a value on our countryside, with all its facets.’

And he once again highlighted the importance of farmers, insisting: ‘I simply cannot see a viable future for the countryside that does not have the farmer - and the family farmer is a vital element in this - as food producer, at the front and centre of the picture.

The Prince makes the comments in a foreword he wrote for the new edition of Country Life magazine, which marks his 66th birthday 

‘It would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land, it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long term.’ The prince is one of the few royals to personally put his money where his mouth is.

His Prince’s Countryside Fund, which was established in 2010, has provided £4.4 million in grants to those who care for the countryside, helping more than 80,000 people and 140 communities.

Mark Hedges, editor of Country Life, said: ‘We are delighted that the Prince agreed to mark his 66th birthday by writing a powerful leader on the importance of preserving the countryside and its way of life.

‘The Prince has a deep understanding and connection with every aspect of people working and living in rural Britain, from highlighting the hardship facing hill farmers who, last year, earned on average £8,000 to the 60,000 new entrants needed in the UK farming sector to secure its future, to the importance of preserving village schools, pubs and shops at the heart of country communities.’

A Defra spokesperson said last night said the department agreed with the future king.

‘Prince Charles is right that we need to value our countryside and protect it for generations to come,’ they said.

‘The rural economy is worth £210 billion and that’s why the government is improving the environment and providing better broadband so we can add to the almost 10,000 new countryside jobs we’ve already created.

‘Our £100 billion food and farming sector is a powerhouse of the economy, employing one in eight people.’
