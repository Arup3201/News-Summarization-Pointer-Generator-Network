'I just want everybody to know about Alyssa, she was a very loving 
mother,' Elsa Munoz, Allyssa's mother-in-law, told KHOU. 'This was a cowardly 
act.'

The accident occurred around 2:30am Saturday on a freeway feeder road in the southeast part of the city. Houston
 police say a white Chrysler was speeding and ran a red light, hitting a
 blue Chevrolet at the intersection of Woodridge Drive near the South Loop.

Six teenagers were inside the of the Chevrolet when it spun on
 impact, hitting a light pole. Police say the teens were on their way 
home from a party.

Police late Saturday night arrested Raquel Vasquez-Hernandez, 23, in connection with the wreck. According to ABC13, she has been charged with three counts of failure to stop and render aid to a fatality. Police also said that the suspect is a flight risk.

Police have not ruled alcohol use out as a factor. They say the occupants of the Chrysler fled on foot, and are still searching for the other occupant of the white Chrysler.
