A Michigan man phoned police this week to complain an online prostitute had hiked her price unexpectedly after she accepted the agreed-upon fee for sex.

Police in Ann Arbor report that they fielded a complaint of a robbery-in-progress around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday at a home on Packard Avenue.

But when they arrived at the location in the southeastern portion of the state, they discovered 
something other than your typical hold-up or heist.

AnnArbor.com writes that police discovered a 45-year-old man haggling with an obstinate 19-year-old Ohio woman whom he had contacted over the InternetÂ  about the price they had initially agreed upon for the illicit act.

According to investigators, the hapless john informed them that once the woman took his cash, she suddenly said told him she was upping her fee.

'So, she was arrested,' Ann Arbor police Lt. Renee Bush told AnnArbor.com.

The man was not arrested, according to the website, which reports that it will now be up to Washtenaw County prosecutors whether to file charges against him.

Meanwhile, the accounts rendered by both the prostitute, as well as the 45-year-old man, wildly differed in substance, according to Bush.

There was no word on how much the john had agreed to pay the alleged prostitute, or through what website he had contacted her on the Internet.

The incident still is under investigation, Bush said.

The story unfolded after a police fielded a call of a robbery taking place at a home on the 2700 block of Packard Avenue in the southeastern Michigan city of Ann Arbor
