As the world lurches from one crisis to another, one thing is reassuringly certain - President Obama will be playing golf and usually with his 'Secretary of Swing', Marvin Nicholson.

The two men have played golf together an astonishing 140 times over the past six years, drawing envious gazes from Washington politicos, who are desperate for any priceless 'face-time' with the leader of the free world.

Indeed, so close are they, that the president was comfortable enough to step away from the Situation Room to play cards with Nicholson during the now legendary Navy SEAL's raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Golf partner: Marvin Nicholson has played on the links with President Obama 140 times since he first joined the staff in 2008 for his successful bid for the presidency 

Hiring the Ferris Bueller-loving Nicholson away from John Kerry for his 2008 campaign, Obama has become firm friends with the man the Secretary of State dubbed 'Chief of Stuff' for his tireless carrying of bags during his own failed attempt at the presidency in 2004.

Profiled in a New York Times portrait over the weekend for which Obama allowed himself to be interviewed, Nicholson is portrayed as a man the president can relax with while Valdimir Putin tests the resolve again of the US again, or ISIS sets the Middle East ablaze.

Having grown up in Canada, the congenial Nicholson, 42, has played golf with the president more times than anyone else.

'Every president needs a space where he can be quiet and let loose and feel normal,' said Obama to the New York Times.

'And when I’m with Marvin, we can talk the same way we would if we were just a couple of guys having a beer and whacking a ball around.'

Reggie Lover, the president's former personal aide prior to Nicholson recounted the story of the bin Laden card game during a 2013 talk at the University of California in Los Angeles.

He told those gathered that on the very day of the raid, while the president's top generals, spy chiefs and administration members such as Hilary Clinton were in the Situation Room, the president excused himself.

The president 'was like, 'I'm not, I'm not going to be down there, I can't watch this entire thing,' said Love.

Feeling the weight of the most significant decision of his presidency weighing him down, the Commander in Chief left the nerve-center of the operationto go to a private dining room where he , Nicholson and Pete Souza, the White House photographer 'must have played 15 hands, 15 games of Spades.'

Potentially wielding great influence because of his closeness to the president, Nicholson is trusted apparently because he 'has no agenda.'

The New York Times spoke to Nicholson's ex-girlfriend, Alyssa Mastromonaco for their piece, and the president's former deputy chief of staff was efusive with praise for her former partner.

'When you just need someone who is going to be nice ot you, that's Marv,' said Mastromonaco.

While the president himself has admitted he shouldn't have played golf immediately after he addressed the beheading of American journalist James Foley and spoke with his family last month, he defends the frequency with which he hits the links in the piece.

'It is the only time I can get four or five hours outside, and I don’t have the option to take long walks through a city,' Obama said to the New York Times.

This goes a long way to explaining why the president rarely conducts business out on the greens, as Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton were known to do.

However, when the president does talk shop out on the course, Nicholson is there.

When the president played with Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and vice president Joe Biden, Nicholson, who plays off a handicap ten lower than the president's 18, was in the cart behind.

Asked why he seems to get on so well with Nicholson, the president pointed to the man's breadth of knowledge.

'He has lived a quirky, adventurous life,' said Obama.

'But that means that he knows a lot about a lot of stuff.'

While Nicholson himself refused to be interviewed for the New York Times piece, his friends from Canada did.

'He was always the life of the party, 100 percent,' said Jeremy Petzing, an old school friend.

'He wasn’t a position-taker. He would never really take sides. He was so easygoing, and the chicks just loved him.'

Yes, the New York Times interview praises Nicholson's manliness, with his ex, Mastromonaco claiming she looked forward to speaking to him on the phone because he 'sounds like a man'.

She also lifted the lid on his softer side, claiming that he paints and also his more robust skills at DIY.

He is very close to Mastromonaco too, playing golf, obviously, with her husband and chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday.

Nicholson's relationship with John Kerry is described as 'more father-son than brotherly' and the article reveals that he and the Secretary of State dined together recently.

He requested Kerry's blessing to take on his role with the Obama team, after Mastromoncao recommended him to the then Illinois senator.

Currently single, Nicholson is known for his love of the cult classic movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.' wrote Nicholson in his senior yearbook in Canada 

The piece comes as the president tried to explain why he played golf on the day he confirmed James Foley was beheaded by ISIS in August.

'Part of this job is also the theater of it,' he told NBC News' Chuck Todd. 'Well, it's not something that always comes naturally to me. But it matters. And I'm mindful of that.'

He added: 'I should have anticipated the optics' of playing golf.

Obama, who was on vacation at the time of Foley's murder, was heavily criticized for heading to the golf course at Martha's Vineyard where he was vacationing on August 21.

He said he was 'heartbroken' over Foley's death and that it was hard for him to hold back tears while speaking with his family.

Obama blamed the contrasting images partially on how the press follows him everywhere, even while he is 'supposed to be on vacation'.

He said there's always potential for bad news to occur, and sometimes it'll happen while the president is on holiday.
