After graffiti artist Banksy argued last week that New York has lost its edge, a new book by photographer Tod Seelie is a poke in the eye to all those critics who claim the city has become too corporate and mainstream.

Bright Nights: Photographs Of Another New York compiles a decade and a half of Seelie’s adventures exploring the city’s rich underbelly of alternative and underground culture.

The New York documented by Steelie is 
one where people regularly climb bridges, party in railroad tunnels, and
sail homemade rafts on the Hudson River.

Steelie fell in love with the city and all its wild possibilities after moving from Rocky River, Ohio. Although the city he documents is a far cry from the picture postcard version on sale to tourists in Times Square. 

His New York is an underground haven for people at society’s edges, who come alive at night to party in abandoned spaces, to make music and art and noise and mess.

‘I hope what happens is when you take in all these images and the subject matter and the aesthetic and you pile them together, you get a sense of this world that's kind of swirling right underneath a lot of people’s feet in New York,’ Seelie told Slate.com.

He moved to the city to 
attend the Pratt Institute in 1997 and became immersed in Brooklyn’s 
burgeoning art and music scene.

Although many of the DIY venues he once frequented have now closed due to rising rents, Seelie believes it remains possible to enjoy an alternative lifestyle in New York - even if you need a regular pay-cheek to help fund it.

‘Some people may think that to do some of the stuff you see in the photos you have to have no job, never work. In fact, the opposite is true.

'A lot of the people in the photos have day jobs, and this is what they do at night. It's really about what you're passionate about, what you do, what you like to make happen on your own,’ he said.

A lot of Seelie's photographs involve a high degree of risk as safety is often questionable and the police are never too far 
away, but for Steelie it is simply a matter of weighing 
risk and reward.

‘I try really hard not to get caught. It's just one aspect of life where you have to evaluate it for yourself. Maybe something's too dangerous, something's too risky, or something's just too stupid - but maybe it's totally worth it,’ he said.

Many people will view Seelie’s adventures as things they simply wouldn’t dream of doing – or perhaps are too scared to try – but it is somehow reassuring to know that somewhere out there in the night there are people crowd surfing in high heels or playing in a mutant brass band.

Seelie's photographs prove that the city that never sleeps is still there, it's just that if you want to find it you might need to look a bit harder and travel a bit further to the outer boroughs than some of those people so quick to say that New York isn’t as good as it once was.

Bright Nights: Photographs Of Another New York by Tod Seelie is available to buy now.
