Her sitcom is a massive hit  adored by millions, but Miranda Hart has revealed she has been so crippled by self-doubt that she turned to the late Eric Morecambe for inspiration.

‘I got to a point a year ago possibly when it was all a bit too much,’  the 41-year-old admits on today’s edition of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. ‘It was quite lonely and I  was struggling.

‘I thought is it worth it? Because you are not doing it for yourself. You are doing it for an audience.

And are they out there laughing? And is comedy a noble, worthwhile career?

‘That was the key question I would have asked Eric and I hope he would have said, “Yes, it’s worth it.” ’

She adds: ‘Then you find ways to manage your life that means you are not in that place – which I am not now. I feel a lot happier, and more confident and celebratory of what I have achieved.’

Eric Morecambe, who died in 1984, is best known as one half of legendary comedy duo Morecambe and Wise

Morecambe, who died in 1984, was the subject of a documentary made by Hart that was screened on BBC1 earlier this year, and she describes the late star as ‘simply my hero’.

She added: ‘If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have launched into getting into comedy. He gave me the licence to be silly and think grown-ups can do that.’

Hart also says she is far more introverted in real life than her persona in her sitcom.

She says: ‘She is my clown .  .  . my on-stage licence to be silly and enjoy life and admit where life  is awkward and the real me is  an introvert really.’

She also says she finds it difficult to cope with the public’s affection for her alter ego.

She says ‘I think they think she is their best friend, which is lovely and that is what I wanted to do with the character.

'But I never expected the sitcom to be a success so I didn’t expect that I would have to deal with the fact that I have got that expectation to meet.’

Hart, whose song selections for Desert Island Discs include the Morecambe And Wise theme Bring Me Sunshine, also reveals she was thrilled to be offered the part of Chummy in the drama Call The Midwife. She returns to play the role in the Christmas Day edition  of the show.

‘It didn’t feel like a risk,’ she says. ‘It felt like just the most wonderful opportunity. Jennifer Worth, who wrote the Call The Midwife books, sent me a copy of it and said, “You remind me of my friend Chummy. I’d love you to play her.”

‘I read it and I thought I have to play this character. It wasn’t too much of a leap .  .  . Sitcom Miranda  is Chummy now – admitting and showing vulnerability. If someone says how are you and you say “I’ve had an awful day” .  .  . the relief on people’s faces because we are all keeping up a pretence.

‘The minute you get a character like Chummy who shows her vulnerability, everyone identifies with her and wants her to win.’

Earlier this year, Miranda made a documentary about Eric Morecambe, and says that learning about him helped her learn how to manage her life better

Hart’s father, a former Royal Navy commander, was aboard the destroyer HMS Coventry when it was sunk during the 1982 Falklands War. And she tells Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young that she was in her 20s when she finally realised how close he had come to death.

She says: ‘He didn’t speak at all when he got back. He put everything on tape and then when I was in my early 20s he allowed me to type them all up, which was amazing and quite emotional listening to his voice going through it so close to the event.’
