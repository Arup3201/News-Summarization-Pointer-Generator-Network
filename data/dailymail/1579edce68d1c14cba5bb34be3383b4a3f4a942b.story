The future shape of Britain if Scotland goes independent has been glimpsed in a piece of KFC chicken.

The bizarre discovery was made by Terry O'Neil when he pulled out a breaded piece of fillet and noticed it looked just like a map of England and Wales - but no Scotland.

It comes hot on the heels of the appearance of a cloud in the shape of the UK with Scotland removed.

Bizarre: This piece of chicken looks like a map of the UK without Scotland, according to the man who found it

Mr O'Neil made his finding when he ordered a bucket of KFC while on holiday in Sussex with his family.

The 55-year-old from the Isle of Wight said: 'I picked this one piece out and I thought it looked like the map of Britain, but then I realised Scotland was missing.'

He added: 'I didn't notice it at first, but the closer I looked the more it just looked like the UK - well, England and Wales - but with no Scotland.

'I don't know whether it's an omen for the outcome of the Scottish referendum, but I wouldn't be surprised if Scotland vote Yes.' 

Earlier Gillian Begnan, a Scot who lives in England, took a picture of a cloud which she says looks like a map of the UK with Scotland removed.

She now believes the odd sighting could be an 'omen' about Thursday's vote - though sceptics may dismiss it as nothing more than coincidence.

'Omen': Gillian Degnan took this photograph of a cloud which looks like the UK without Scotland

Mrs Begnan, 44, grew up in the village of Fairlie in North Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland, but has lived in Nottingham for 20 years and so is not able to vote in the referendum.

She captured the photograph of the distinctive cloud while on holiday with her family in Sardinia.

'I was on my sun lounger when I spotted it in the sky,' she said. 'I thought it was a bit weird.

'The referendum is the talking point between everyone at the moment and I started to wonder whether it was an omen about how the vote is going to go.'

Mrs Begnan added that she supports a No vote - but does not resent the fact that she is unable to cast a ballot.

'I would vote no,' she said. 'I think Scotland would be too small on its own.

'A split would have a negative impact on the rest of Britain as well. I think it would cause a huge disadvantage to everyone, financially and politically.'

Close battle: The Yes and No campaigns headed by Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling are now neck-and-neck

The engineer continue: 'I have been away so long now it has to be a decision made by residents, it's not going to affect me directly.

'Most of my family still live in Scotland so we discuss what is happening with them.

'My daughters are 13 and 16, but my oldest thinks that 16 is too young to vote and she feels like if she had a vote she wouldn't be ready to decide.

'But my youngest is quite interested in it all and she says she would vote Yes if she could.

'Whatever happens I think it's going to have a big impact on the UK as a whole.'
