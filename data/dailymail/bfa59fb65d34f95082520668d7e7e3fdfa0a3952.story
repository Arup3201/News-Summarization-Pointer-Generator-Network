Hundreds of visitors have flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, after the face of Jesus appeared after a landslide

Now some local landowners are cashing in by charging visitors to view the holy image, according to a local newspaper.

'If you believe in Jesus, you will see your image,' Ximena Rosero Arango told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo after visiting the site to photograph the hillside.

The image has also been making the rounds on social media since Saturday. But not everyone was impressed with the 'miracle'.

There was some debate on social media whether it was the face of Jesus as one Twitter user Magui, under the handle ‏@AdasOz, said: 'Congratulations to those who can see the face of Jesus in landslide in Putumayo.

'I just see a mountain of earth surrounded by trees.'  

It certainly is not the first time that Jesus has turned up somewhere unexpected.

The face of Christ has appeared on everything from Marmite lids, tacos and naan bread, to tree stumps and laundry.

In 2012 the image of Jesus was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire

In 2012, the son of God was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire.

Sam Dalby discovered the divine countenance on a roughly plastered section of wall.

His face has also been spotted in household items and even stains.

Nurse Alex Cotton, 38, found an image of Jesus in a drainpipe at her home in Coventry, West Midlands which was dubbed 'the Second plumbing'.

Bank worker Toby Elles claimed he was saved by divine intervention when he woke to find a burning frying pan on his cooker.

On further inspection of his singed bacon snack he also found the face of the Son of God burnt to the bottom of the pan.

They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said.

In the U.S., Mary Jo Coady, a medical secretary from Massachusetts made a similar discovery burned on her iron while doing housework.

The 44-year-old said the image immediately renewed her faith in God.

Drinkers at the Tanners Hall pub in Darlington, County Durham, were stunned to see the face of Christ in the foil top of a Bulmers cider bottle.

And mother-of-three Claire Allen, 36, found the Saviour's friendly features in the lid of a jar of Marmite which was smeared with the yeast-based spread.

She said: 'I opened the Marmite jar and the lid caught my eye. Immediately I thought, that's Jesus.

'It wasn't a new jar, but I'd never noticed that before.'

Ms Allen, of Ystrad, Rhondda, South Wales, showed the lid to her older boys Jamie, 14, and Tomas, 11.

'They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. 

Sarah Crane, from Orpington, was stunned when she hung her laundry out to dry and discovered the face of Jesus staring back at her from a crumpled sock.

Miss Crane was so impressed by the clarity of the face she even built a shrine to the holy image. 

'I'd left the washing out to dry overnight - and it had probably been sitting there a bit too long when I noticed the face in the sock,' she said.

'I called my boyfriend over straight away - we could both clearly see the face of Jesus in the sock. There is a straight-on face, and a side profile too - we couldn't believe it. 

'We think it's a bit of a sign - but for what we don't know.' 

An image of  Jesus Christ also appeared on a tree stump in a Belfast cemetery.

The tree, which was felled at Belfast City Cemetery in west Belfast, appeared to show the face of a bearded man resembling Jesus on the remaining stump beside a grave.

While in Texas, a man found the holy image in the middle of breakfast and the revelation came in his bacon and egg taco.

Ernesto Garza, 80, says he was busy munching away when he realised that Christ was staring back at him -- his face visible in the burn marks of the tortilla.

It's a blessing from God,' Mr Garza told KTVB news.

A Texan found a picture of Jesus in the middle of his breakfast bacon and egg taco which he was hoping to frame and save

Churchgoers in Russia began worshipping at a tree after this image of Jesus appeared in the bark 

Mr Garzo was hoping to keep the taco and eventually figure out how to preserve it so he can frame it to hang on his wall.

While in Russia, churchgoers have begun worshipping at a tree after claiming that religious icons with the faces of Jesus and the saints appeared on its trunk.

The images began to appear on the birch tree in the village of Burmakino in central Russia's Kirov Oblast last month in the places where gardeners had trimmed off old branches.

Villager Valentina Naumova explained: 'We thought nothing of it until the tree started to form these arched shapes, just like church icons.

'Then the faces of Jesus and his disciples began to appear in them and we realised this really must be God's work.' 

Now whole congregations of people gather in front of the tree to pray and give thanks.
