A mother who cheated to get her daughter into a good school has been fined £500 and sentenced to community service in a ground-breaking case.

Lura Pacheco, 34, forged a tenancy agreement in an attempt to persuade high-performing schools she lived closer than she really did.

But the mother-of-two, who works for an international recruitment company, was caught out when the property’s real owner received an offer and charged with forgery.

Havering Council, which brought the prosecution, said the case was the first of its kind and others could follow.

It was brought against a backdrop of rising numbers of suspicious school applications that are prompting investigations by councils across the country.

Latest figures suggest that council probes into potentially fraudulent applications have soared 11-fold in five years.

Five years ago Mrinal Patel became the first parent to be prosecuted for allegedly lying over school places but the charges were later dropped after running into legal problems.

In the latest case, Pacheco, a Portuguese national, had been desperate to get her 11-year-old daughter into a secondary school in the London borough of Havering because she believed they had a better reputation than comprehensives nearer her home in Chadwell Heath, Barking and Dagenham.

Magistrates heard how a friend of Pacheco offered to produce a forged tenancy agreement for a home in Hornchurch, within Havering borough, using the fake firm Easy Property Services.

The move could have secured a place for her daughter at either Brittons Academy, Chafford School, Frances Bardsley School for Girls, Sacred Heart of Mary Girls School or Bower Park Academy.

But town hall investigators uncovered the forgery when the offer of a place was sent to the property’s real owner, who alerted the local authority.

After admitting one forgery offence - committed on December 13 last year – Pacheco was ordered to pay £500 and sentenced to 100 hours’ community service.

Sentencing at Barkingside magistrates’ court, presiding magistrate Michael Peacock said: ‘You are obviously a very good and conscientious mother and like all good mothers you want your kid to go to the best school available.

‘I think the public are very aware of the lengths people go to to try and secure that. We hear of people buying expensive houses in expensive streets and so on in order to get into a certain catchment area. But whatever you do it’s got to be within the law.

‘What you did was dishonest. It was cheating, cheating the system. It was unfair to people who would have wanted that place if you had succeeded.’

Pacheco was ordered to pay £500 and given 100 hours’ community service at Barkingside magistrates' court (pictured) after admitting forgery. Presiding magistrate Michael Peacock said she had 'cheated the system'

Speaking after the hearing, Pacheco told the London Evening Standard: ‘Mums just want the best for their children, they want the best education for them possible. I am still shaken by this experience.’

Giles Morrison, representing Havering council, said: ‘She wanted her daughter to get into a Havering school as these are generally better and she was aware that at this time her address was covered by Barking and Dagenham.

‘It [the offence] is, I am told, something Havering council is very concerned with in the borough and there might be a number of other prosecutions that might happen in the future. But this is thought to be the first of its kind.’

Damian White, deputy leader of Havering council, said: ‘Creating false documents, no matter what the reason, is fraud and ultimately takes away places from those that were entitled to them.’

The case follows suggestions that councils are toughening up on parents who try to cheat the system to secure their chosen schools.

Tactics include using false addresses lying about siblings and even impersonating family members.

But councils are becoming increasingly alert to possible ruses and demanding more rigorous proofs of residence.

Sanctions include withdrawing places refusing applications in or in extreme cases, prosecution.

In 2009, Harrow Council accused 41-year-old Mrinal Patel of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School.

She faced up to a year in jail or a £5,000 fine after the council used the Fraud Act 2006 to prosecute her over the school application for her five-year-old son Rhys.

Mrs Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates’ Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation.

But two months later the council withdrew its action after being advised that the Act may not apply to her case and could be open to challenge.

At the time, Mrs Patel told the BBC that Harrow’s decision not to launch the ‘disproportionate’ action against her showed she was innocent.

In 2009, Harrow Council accused 41-year-old Mrinal Patel (pictured) of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School. She claimed she had lived at the address for 14 years

But she admitted she had said on the application form that she had lived at the address for 14 years, when in fact she had stayed there for only four weeks.

The mother-of-three claimed she wrote this figure because her mother had been living at the address for 14 years. She had been ‘under a tremendous amount of stress’ at the time.

Her mother’s home was walking distance from the school that was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and received more than 400 applications for 90 places.

However, council action has sometimes crossed into over-zealousness.

In 2008, Poole Borough Council mounted an extraordinary covert surveillance operation targeting businesswoman Jenny Paton, her partner Tim Joyce and their three children.

The family were followed for three weeks by council officials who wrongly suspected the family of lying to get into a good school. The investigators filled out detailed surveillance forms, describing the family's car as a 'target vehicle'.

Using powers available under anti-terror laws, the council surveillance team made detailed notes of the family's whereabouts on 21 occasions.

But the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which heard a complaint from the family in 2010, concluded the council's operation was an improper, unnecessary and unlawful use of the surveillance powers.
