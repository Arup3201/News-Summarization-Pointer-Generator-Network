Liverpool have moved a step closer to receiving the go-ahead to increase the capacity of Anfield from 44,000 to 54,000 as their proposal has been recommended for approval by council planners.

The Premier League club will know if their request to Liverpool City Council has been given the all clear on September 23.

Liverpool plan to begin development on their Main Stand at the end of December or early part of January 2015.

This is what the new Anfield could look like when it has been redeveloped  

Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for Reds fans

44,689 spectators saw Liverpool take on Aston Villa in the Premier League at Anfield on Saturday

The redevelopment of Anfield is likely to take an estimated 20 months to be fully completed if members of Liverpool's City Council give the club the proverbial green light.

Liverpool hope they can eventually expand Anfield to 58,800 once the first phase of improvement to the Main Stand has been completed. 

The north-west outfit's domestic and European home games will not be affected by plans to improve Anfield's Main Stand.
