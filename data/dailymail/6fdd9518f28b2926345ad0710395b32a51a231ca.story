Imagine the full stop at the end of this sentence was a camera.

It might sound unbelievable, but that’s exactly what U.S. technology company Rambus have built - an incredibly tiny device no bigger than the tip of a pencil.

In reality though, it’s not really a camera but rather a tiny chip embedded in a piece of glass that converts the light it receives into an algorithm to create pictures.

The researchers behind the project, David Stork and Patrick Gill, say their lensless invention could hypothetically allow almost any device to contain a camera.

Now you see it: The lensless camera (left) is tiny compared to a traditional smartphone camera (middle) and pales in comparison to the size of a coin

It works by using a
 tiny chip known as a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) 
embedded in a paper-thin piece of glass.

As light hits the glass, the imager processes the light into an algorithm.

Etched patterns on the glass then refract the light in different ways as it passes through.

At
 this point the image is unrecognisable but, ultimately, the algorithms 
reconstruct the light into a recognisable image that mimics the real 
object.

At the moment the 
images are relatively blurry at a resolution of just 128x128, but as the
 technology is advanced it’s likely its capability will get better and 
better.

The technology is still in its infancy, but this prototype shows just what could be achieved by this sort of technology in future.

Without requiring a lens, future gadgets like smartphones could be made smaller and smaller while still possessing picture-taking abilities.

Further down the line it’s possible the technology could be embedded into everyday items like clothes, mirrors and toys to give us entirely new methods of interactivity.

A traditional camera (top) relies on a multitude of equipment to take a picture, but the lensless camera (bottom) can create the same image with a paper-thin chip

‘These sensors are so small they should find use in endoscopy, medical sensing, machine inspection [and] surveillance,’ Stork and Gill write in their research paper on the device.

They go on to add that the device is ‘so inexpensive’ that it should find use in ‘a number of single-use scenarios, for instance in surgery and warfare.

Imagine: Here, John Lennon's face has been recreated by the lensless camera by processing the light from a picture of the famous Beatles star

Similarly the Mona Lisa has been processed by the camera here. Although a bit blurrier than the original for now, the technology is still in its infancy and highlights the possibilities of such a device
