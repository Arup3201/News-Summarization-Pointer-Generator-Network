A father-of-three suffered horrific burns after pouring petrol onto a lit barbecue to 'keep it going'.

John Woof, 32, doused the grill in petrol from his lawnmower but was immediately engulfed by an ‘eight-foot fireball’.

His fiancee and friends rushed to cover him in water and wrapped his wounds in cling film.

Grin and bear it: John Woof, 32, of Bamber Bridge, Preston, doused his barbecue in petrol from his mower to liven it up but was engulfed by an 'eight-foot fireball'

At least seven children were at the scene when the horror incident unfolded, but escaped unhurt.

Today - as Mr Woof was recovering in hospital with burns to his face, shoulder, arms, chest, stomach and his left leg - fire bosses warned people of the dangers of using flammable liquid on barbecues as temperatures continue to soar.

A photo showed him smiling from a hospital bed with bandages on his left-hand side.

Mr Woof, who works as an engineer, had invited neighbours and their children to his home in Bamber Bridge, south of Preston, for a barbecue, when the coals appeared to be dying down.

As youngsters played in the garden he poured petrol on to the already lit barbecue, which sent a fireball rolling across his body at 7pm on Thursday.

His fiancee Naomi Molyneux, 22, who works as a care assistant in a nursing home, said: 'I was just about to go inside the house to make my neighbour’s kids a drink and I saw it blow up.

Concerned: Today medics at Royal Preston Hospital (pictured) were concerned Mr Woof's airways may be blocked due to the extent of his burns

'I noticed his chest first, and then I got him inside and soaked him in towels on his face and chest and hand, before running him a cold bath and kept pouring cold water over him.

'I work in a nursing home, so I knew to do that and I rang one of my friends who is a qualified nurse, and she said to put cling film on him.'

Today, medics at Royal Preston Hospital were concerned Mr Woof’s airways may be blocked due to the extent of his burns.

Barbecue-related injuries have risen in recent years.

According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), almost 2,000 people are rushed to A&E units each year having had an accident involving a barbecue.

The most common types of injuries are burns or scalding relating to the flame.

 General Safety

Make sure your barbecue is in good working order.

Ensure the barbecue is on a flat site, well away from a shed, trees or shrubs.

Keep children, garden games and pets well away from the cooking area.

Never leave the barbecue unattended.

Keep a bucket of water or sand nearby for emergencies.

Ensure the barbecue is cool before attempting to move it.Charcoal Barbecues

Use only enough charcoal to cover the base to a depth of about 50mm (2 inches).

Only use recognised fire lighters or starter fuel and only on cold coals – use the minimum necessary and never use petrol.

Never put hot ashes straight into a dustbin or wheelie bin – they could melt the plastic and cause a fire.Gas Barbecues

Make sure the tap is turned off before changing the gas cylinder.

Change cylinders outdoors if possible or in a well ventilated area.

If you suspect a leak to the cylinder or pipe work, brush soapy water around the joints and watch for bubbles – tighten to fix but do not overtighten.

After cooking, turn off the gas cylinder before turning off at the controls to ensure any residual gas in the pipe work is used up.

Ms Molyneux said it was lucky he had not been more severely injured.

She said: 'It was horrible, it just seemed to blow up into a big flame.

'I did not go outside again I was just concentrating on helping John.

'It (barbecue) was not hot enough, so he decided to try to be clever and put petrol on.

'We have a petrol mower and he thought he had only put a bit on, but he had put quite a lot on.'

The couple’s garden was full of children and Ms Molyneux  has warned others not to use petrol on barbecues.

She added: 'We will just be cooking food in the oven and bringing it outside from now on.'

Witnesses who were at the barbecue spoke of their shock at seeing their friend engulfed in flames.

Neighbour Emma Holt, 37, who was with children Evin, 10, and Jake, 14, said: 'There was just a ‘whoosh’ and then he was straight into the bath.'We had flannels and cold water on him. It could have been a lot worse.

'I was just worrying about getting the kids out of the way.

'I rang the ambulance and the fire engine turned up, then a rapid response ambulance.'

Another neigbour Lucy Davis, 32, also of The Crescent, was also at the party with Maddison, four, Megan, 11, and six-year-old Ryan.

She said: 'I was stood right next to it.

'I was not looking but when I turned he had poured the petrol on and it went about 8ft up in the air.

'He just ran - I went into the kitchen and I saw his skin was peeling.'

Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Steve Boyne, based at Bamber Bridge station, who attended the incident, said: 'This highlights the dangers of igniting barbecues.

'People should only use the correct items for igniting.

'Clearly petrol is not the right fluid to be using. I think the barbecue was already lit but he wanted to get it going better so he lobbed petrol on it.'

Over the past few weeks, there have been several incidents with people suffering burns while using a barbecue.

At the weekend a Hampshire father and his three-year-old daughter were taken to hospital with burns after petrol was used on a barbecue and in Peterborough one person had to be taken to hospital and another was injured after a barbecue fire spread out of control.

Last week in Stockport a man suffered severe burns while trying to start a barbecue. 

Believing the fire was failing to ignite, he went to the garage to get some flammable liquid.

But the fire took off while he was gone and set fire to the garage door.

He became trapped inside and suffered serious burns. In recent years, barbecue-related injuries have risen.

According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), almost 2,000 people are rushed to A&E units each year having had an accident involving a barbecue.

The most common types of injuries are burns or scalding relating to the flame.
