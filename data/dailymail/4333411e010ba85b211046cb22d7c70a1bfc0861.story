A man who claims he was sexually abused by Jimmy Savile’s chauffeur says he has been cheated of justice by David Smith’s suicide.

The former driver for the BBC was found dead on the day he was due to stand trial for sex crimes uncovered as part of the Savile inquiry.

The convicted paedophile had been charged with two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency and a fifth charge of rape involving a 12-year-old boy in 1984.

Smith, chauffeur to Savile and other celebrities during the 1980s, denied the offences and was due to stand trial on Monday

Smith, chauffeur to Savile and other celebrities during the 1980s, denied the offences and was due to stand trial on Monday.

But he failed to show up at court and a warrant was issued for his arrest. His body was found at his home in Lewisham, South London, following an apparent suicide.

In a separate case to those charges, a 45-year-old man who had an abuse claim pending against Smith, spoke out yesterday to say the 67-year-old’s death has cheated him and other alleged victims.

The man, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ‘I am bitterly disappointed that Smith will not now face trial after committing suicide.’

The victim’s solicitor Alan Collins, of law firm Pannone, said: ‘My client is angry and frustrated that Smith will not face his accusers. Victims often take a great deal of time to psychologically prepare themselves to come forward and confront their abusers. They have a desire to be vindicated.’

Smith was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree

He added that Smith’s death may have the effect of making his client and other alleged victims feel cheated of justice.

Smith had a string of previous convictions for sexual offences against boys, dating back to 1966.

The revelations will raise questions over why he was ever permitted to work for the BBC.

Smith was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree, the investigation begun after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Savile.

He was due to be the first of those arrested under the operation, which was launched last October, to face a jury.

In the case that Smith was due to stand trial for on Monday, it was claimed that he met his victim at a swimming pool and invited him back to his flat, where he sexually abused him.

He also took the boy on a visit to the BBC studios at White City in West London. The boy claimed he was indecently assaulted during the journey. The alleged victim’s partner contacted police after seeing his response to the ITV documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, aired on October 3 last year.

At a court appearance in July, Smith pleaded not guilty to all offences and was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court.

But he failed to show and initially it was thought he may have been held up due to transport delays as a result of the St Jude storm.

When there was still no sign of him by 2pm, Judge Alistair McCreath issued a warrant for his arrest. Neighbours described how police used a battering ram to get into Smith’s top floor council flat before discovering his body.

A woman said: ‘They got in through the door, smashed it right down, there was a terrible bang, like a wrecking ball. They were in there for a while. Then the ambulance came. They took his body out, it was all covered up.’

Another neighbour Jamie Cochran, 28, described Smith as a loner. He said: ‘He was quiet, kept himself to himself. He never seemed to want to chat. Now I know why – he was hiding something. He was a typical loner.

‘It is awful. He lives next to two primary schools. I thought if you were on the sex offenders’ register you couldn’t live right next to where kids go to school.’

Smith had been a full-time carer for his 95-year-old mother. It is understood that she was not at the flat at the time police made the discovery. She was told of her son’s death on Monday night.

Another neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘His mum was very old, but she will still have enough about her to realise what has happened. What a terrible thing to happen to a person in the last years of their life.’

Judge McCreath yesterday ordered that the file on the case be closed. He heard from Detective Constable Michael Wallace, the officer who identified the body, that it was the same man as charged in the indictment.

Two men were arrested yesterday on suspicion of sexual offences as part of the Yewtree inquiry. The men – aged 64 and 74 – were taken into custody from separate addresses in South London. Detectives have run Yewtree in three strands – allegations involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others. The claims against both men arrested yesterday are being dealt with under the ‘others’ strand.
