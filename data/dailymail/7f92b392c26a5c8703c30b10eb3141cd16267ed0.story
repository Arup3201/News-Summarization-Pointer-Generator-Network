She was the 60's beauty famous for her epoch-defining music, wild ways and a passionate love affair with Mick Jagger but Marianne Faithfull has revealed that she didn't actually like men - or enjoy sex - at all.

Faithfull, now 66, is to appear on BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are and in the show explains that the rape of her mother and grandmother at the end of World War II left her with a horror of men that lasted more than 30 years.

Her mother, Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso, who hailed from Austria, was attacked by Red Army soldiers as they liberated Vienna in 1945.

Tragic: The rape of Marianne's mother left her unable to enjoy sex without drugs forÂ  three decades

'My mother particularly, and my grandmother, naturally enough, really hated men,' the singer said, according to a Sunday Times report.

'It twisted them both. My grandmother turned away from my grandfather, who adored her. And Eva never got over that and always hated men.

'She then passed that on to me, actually. It took me years, until the time I got to 50 or so, before I could be in a relationship and love; and not have to take drink or drugs to have sex.'

After ending her relationship with Jagger in 1970, Faithfull struggled with drug abuse for much of the following decade.

At one point, her heroin addiction became so acute, she spent two years living on the streets of Soho, battling with her drug dependency and anorexia.

'I think my mother, and her unconscious and unspoken loathing of men, had a huge effect on me,' she added.

'It was a big problem for me in the Sixties, especially as I had to pretend that everything was wonderful, wild and sexual. But it really wasn't.'

She also talks of her relationship with Jagger, which began while she was still married to first husband John Dunbar, during the programme, saying:

'He loved me and I loved him.

'I just walked away. I don't really know why. I had to move on.

'Of course it was very painful, and very very hard because I loved him.'

The documentary, which is to be broadcast on the 18th September, also delves further into the story of Faithfull's mother and her Jewish grandmother, Flora.

Although the Nazis insisted Flora change her name to Sara in order to make her more easily identifiable as Jewish, both Flora and her daughter escaped deportation to concentration camps.

Others were not so lucky: more than 60,0000 Viennese Jews died in Nazi camps during the war.

After the defeat of the Nazis, the women remained in Vienna before Eva met and married Major Robert Glynn Faithfull.

Marianne was born in 1946 but the marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce in 1952.
