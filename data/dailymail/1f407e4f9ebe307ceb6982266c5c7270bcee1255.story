A eight-year-old boy has died after he was hit by a bullet fired at his Detroit home as he slept.

Jakari Pearson was sleeping in his upstairs bedroom when a gunman fired several times at the house, striking the youngster in the chest at around 1.15am on Wednesday.

The boy was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Jakari's mother was also shot and was taken to a hospital, but her condition is unknown, WWJ reported.

Neighbors said they heard about five rapid shots early on Wednesday and several bullet holes were visible in the bricks and a window of an upstairs bedroom at the home.

Sources told WWJ that the shooting came after a domestic situation between the boy's mother and a man other than Jakari's father.

B'atrice Spears, who lives nearby and has young children who played with the boy, left a teddy bear on the porch next to a superhero-themed bedsheet and called him a 'sweetheart'.

'Hearing the gunshots and I heard his mother screaming, so I ran around here,' Spears told The Detroit News. 'Seen him in the middle of the street, and I seen his mother in the middle of the street, also. Police were already here, they were just waiting on an ambulance.'

Police Sgt. Michael Woody said investigators have a 'good idea' of who they're looking for and are working to track that person down.

'We hope the community continues to talk to us and feeds us information so we can track this individual down and get him into custody very quickly,' Sgt. Woody said.

Details about a suspect weren't immediately released and police said others are being questioned.

A candlelight vigil will be held at the complex at 9.30pm on Wednesday to honor Jakari's memory.
