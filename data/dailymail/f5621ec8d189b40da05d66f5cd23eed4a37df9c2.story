Hull KR have given two-year contract extensions to back-row forwards Aaron Ollett and Steven Holker, two products of their academy system.

Ollett, 21, made his Super League debut last June and has appeared in six of the Robins' last seven matches.

'It's a weight off my shoulders to sign a new deal and now I want to kick on and have another strong season next year,' Ollett said.

'I've been pleased with the amount of games I've had at the back end of this season and I feel as though I've been able to prove my worth to the club.

'It's now up to me to cement a regular first team spot next season.'

Holker, 18, has yet to play Super League having spent most of the season on the injury list.
