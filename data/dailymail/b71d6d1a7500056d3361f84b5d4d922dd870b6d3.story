The oldest continuously operating farm in the United States – dating back almost 400 years – has been sold.

The 132-acre farm in Dover, NH, sold last month to Massachusetts farmer Matt Kozazcki for just over $1million after being on sale for three years. It was in the Tuttle family since 1632.

Originally listed for over $3.35 million, according to Fox News, the farm sold for much less than the Tuttles expected.

Mr Kozazcki plans to restore the farm, renamed Tendercrisp Farms,  to its colonial glory, he told the Foster’s Daily Democrat.

‘It’s a lot of heritage,’ he told the paper. ‘We’re trying to make it as much of a farm as possible.’

Mr Kozazcki has installed a fence made from hand cut and split New Hampshire cedar, removed flood lights in the parking lot and painted the barn since assuming the historic plot, he told the newspaper.

What once was a fruit and vegetable farm until the Tuttles, according to Fox News, will soon sell meat, fruits, vegetables and eventually have an orchard, said Mr Kozazcki.

The farm will eventually have about 20 cows but meat will come from another farm he owns in Newbury, MA., he told the paper,

Mr
 Kozazcki expects the farm’s store to open in December, he said, adding 
that he will install a memorial plaque in honor of the Tuttle’s near the
 entrance.

Farming since 1986, the old hand wants to help keep the industry alive as best he can.

‘It’s sad that farms keep going out of business,’ he told the Daily Democrat, ‘I know what it’s like to start with zero.’

According to the New York Times, the farm was started when there were no more than 10,000 colonists in America.

It is this longevity, and the history brought with it, that has seen the farm’s 125 acres put under a conservation easement – which protects it from being developed, according to the Daily Democrat.
