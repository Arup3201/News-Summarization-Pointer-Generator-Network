Brits fighting in Syria face being charged with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg said they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers.

The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences occurred on British soil. 

The government warned Syria is now a 'breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11.

Government sources suggest around 2,000 Europeans fighting in Syria, including at least 200 already known to the British security services.

It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad.

Tackling the problem has become a top priority for MI5, MI6 and counter-terror police.

In today’s State Opening of Parliament, the Queen announced details of a new Serious Crime Bill to ‘tackle child neglect, disrupt serious organised crime and strengthen powers to seize the proceeds of crime’.

It includes new powers to ‘reduce the potential threat posed by UK citizens and residents returning home after taking part in the Syria conflict’ the government said.

Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'The police and security services are working to detect and disrupt terrorist threats from Syria and will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security. 

The Serious Crime Bill has been drawn up by Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured walking to listen to the Queen's Speech with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna

'This Bill would extend the reach of the Terrorism Act 2006 so that UK-linked individuals and those who seek to harm UK interests, who travel overseas to prepare or train more generally for terrorism, can be prosecuted as if their actions had taken place in the UK.

'Syria is a dangerous place and the UK advises against all travel to the country. 

'Even people travelling for well-intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk, including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups. 

'The best way to help Syrian people is by donating to UK-registered charities.' 

Anyone convicted of preparation of terrorist acts abroad can be jailed for life, while a conviction for training for terrorism currently carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, under the Terrorism Act 2006.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has previously warned that the number of UK fighters returning from Syria of ‘serious concern’.

In February Charles Farr, the head of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, said the work of the security services would be dominated by the fall-out of the  Syrian conflict for a long time to come.

He added: ‘Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11 — because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict.

‘The agencies and many others involved here in counter terrorist work will be occupied with this for the forseeable future.’

The government has warned against any travel to Syria and ministers have the power to strip suspects of their passport or their right to stay in the UK. In today’s speech the Queen added: ‘My ministers will strive to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria, to reduce violence and promote a political settlement.’

The government set out three priorities on Syria: Supporting efforts to find a political solution to the conflict; alleviating humanitarian suffering; and protecting UK security by tackling extremism and getting rid of Assad’s chemical weapons.

The government said: Ending the conflict is strongly in our national interest. It poses a growing threat to UK, regional and international peace and security.

'Syria is a dangerous place and the UK advises against all travel to the country'

‘Syria is a breeding ground for terrorists. Eliminating the threat from Assad’s chemical weapons will benefit us all.

'The world also continues to bear the financial costs of the conflict as we attempt to alleviate the intense humanitarian suffering.’

The Serious Crime Bill also includes a US-style anti-mafia law to prosecute lawyers, accountants and couriers who work for crime lords but currently 'keep their hands clean'.

Paedophiles who download manuals on how to groom their victims are to be treated like terrorists who possess bomb making guides under a new offence of 'possessing paedophile manuals'.

There will also be tougher laws to tackle sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation, while a Cinderella Law will target parents who starve their children of love and affection.

The Bill will also extend the reach of the offences in the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 so that they apply to habitual as well as permanent UK residents.

The aim is to help legal officials to track, disrupt and bring to justice criminals who target vulnerable women and children.

Up to 23,000 girls under the age of 15 years could be at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female circumcision or female genital cutting, each year and nearly 66,000 women are living with its consequences, according to a study based on 2001 census data in England and Wales.

Population growth and immigration from practising countries since 2001 mean the impact could be even greater given that it is often a hidden crime.

It is a form of child abuse, largely carried out on children aged between the five and eight years old, which can have devastating physical and psychological consequences for girls and women, the NSPCC notes.

Efforts are also being made under the Serious Crime Bill to sharpen the tools that the National Crime Agency (NCA) and other crime fighting organisations have to try and tackle criminals. This includes new powers to seize detain and destroy criminal substances suspected of being used as cutting agents for illegal drugs.
