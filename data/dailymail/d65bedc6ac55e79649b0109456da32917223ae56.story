A man has been ejected from the Republican National Convention after throwing peanuts at a black camerawoman and shouting 'this is how we feed animals.'

Republicans fear the alleged racist incident, which took place at the Tampa Bay Times Forum in Florida yesterday afternoon, will further dent the party's support among African Americans ahead of the presidential election.

At least one poll has shown the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has less than one per cent support among black voters

Outrage: Twitter users have voiced their anger over the alleged racist incident at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida

Damaging: The alleged incident could further damage support among African Americans for the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (pictured at the convention)

Support: Republicans were out in force to support Mr Romney at the convention centre

The 'attack' - reported to have been on a
CNN camerawoman - has led to a furious response on Twitter, with some users claiming it could undermine Republican support.

The incident could not have come at a worse time for Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney, who was officially unveiled as the party's candidate on Tuesday.

Mr Romney has struggled to shake off his 'stiff' image among voters - with some commentators claiming he does not have the charisma needed to win the race for the White House.

His campaign received a big boost yesterday when his wife Ann took to the podium at the Republican convention.

Hope: Ann Romney tried to shake off her husband's 'stiff' image when she spoke at the convention yesterday

Wearing a simple, flame-red dress and looking a 
little nervous initially during what Romney advisers had described as a 
high-stakes speech, the would-be First Lady described her marriage before her 
husband became a multi-millionaire venture capitalist.

Her heartfelt address was designed to 
highlight the softer, personal side of her husband, who has often been described 
as stiff and uncomfortable.

She described her 'real marriage' to the 
former Massachusetts governor hours after he was officially confirmed as the 
Republican candidate to take on Barack Obama in November's 
election.

Following Obamaâ€™s negative ads 
portraying Mr Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat, Mrs Romney sought to paint him 
as an ordinary man and theirs as an ordinary life.

Affection: The Romneys thrilled the convention crowd when they shared a kiss

Polls immediately before the convention showed his favourability rating among voters was down to 35 per cent.

CNN reportedly said it is working with 
convention officials to address the matter but has 'no further 
comment.'
