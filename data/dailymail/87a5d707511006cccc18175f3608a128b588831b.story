A student has privately prosecuted the man who harassed him after filming evidence of the abuse on a video camera hidden inside a pair of sunglasses.

Haresh Mehta, who lives in Southampton, bought the surveillance glasses in a bid to document the abuse he was suffering at the hands of his tormentor.

The 20-year-old student says he complained repeatedly to the police about insults and intimidation he suffered from the man. 

Haresh Mehta, 20, from Southampton, mounted a private prosecution against his tormentor by using footage which he obtained through his surveillance sunglasses (file pic of Google Glass)

He claims he called officers over the incident five to ten times but no action was taken.

So Mr Mehta, a student at Southampton University, decided to take matters into his own hands.

He bought a pair of sunglasses - similar to Google Glasses - which contain a covert video recorder in the frame. He then went about collating evidence which could be used against the man in court.

Once he had evidence of the man swearing at him on camera, Mr Mehta brought his own charge against the man under the Public Order Act 1986.

The landmark case - believed to be one of the first of its kind - may lead to more private prosecutions of this kind.

The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court.

Mr Mehta alleged the defendant's conduct involved 'threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour' which caused him 'harassment, alarm or distress'. 

As the defendant pleaded guilty, the way in which the video evidence was obtained was never scrutinised.

He spent one day in prison, after being given the option by magistrates of paying a £500 fine or spending the day in custody.

Mr Mehta told The Guardian: 'It was like having a camera between your eyes.' 

After Mr Mehta contacted a lawyer for advice, a lawyer for the defendant wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service asking it to take over the case, according to the paper.

The CPS wrote back saying there was a realistic prospect of conviction but decided not to intervene. 

It said it was satisfied that both sides were represented and there was no need for an independent prosecutor. 

Gareth Jones, a solicitor with the London law firm Rustem Guardian, who gave Mehta advice about the case, told the paper: 'This is very rare. This is the first time we have done a case like this.

'If it was the CPS themselves doing it, it might have cost them a lot of time on a not very serious case.'

A CPS spokesperson said: 'We decided that there was no need for the CPS to take over this prosecution and therefore the private prosecution should be left to continue.' 

Earlier this year, Google Glass went on sale in the UK, costing around £1,000. 

Similar to a pair of spectacles, the hands-free device is equipped with an optical display which shows digital information and allows users to access apps using voice commands and movement.  

MailOnline has contacted Hampshire Constabulary for comment.  

The right to bring a private prosecution dates back to the earliest days of the legal system. Under UK law, anyone has the right to bring a private prosecution in front of the criminal courts. 

Cases have historically been rare due to the high costs involved in investigating and pursuing such cases.

Legal aid is not available for private prosecutions, meaning they have to be paid for by the alleged victim.

There are a number of organisations that regularly prosecute cases before the courts but do so as private individuals, using the right of any individual to bring a private prosecution. One example is the RSPCA.

According to CPS guidance, there is nothing wrong in allowing a private prosecution to run its course through to verdict and sentence.

There is no requirement for the CPS to take over a private prosecution. The fact that a private prosecution succeeds is not an indication that the case should have been prosecuted by the CPS, it says.

However, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has the power to take over private prosecutions and there will be times when the CPS will exercise this power. 

There has been a growing trend towards private prosecutions in the past few years, raising concerns about a divided justice system, which could only allow private companies or wealthy individuals to seek justice.

The most high-profile private prosecution was by the family of Stephen Lawrence in 1996. It was made against five suspects - only three of whom made it to trial - after three years of failed police investigations.

All the defendants were acquitted on the orders of the judge.
