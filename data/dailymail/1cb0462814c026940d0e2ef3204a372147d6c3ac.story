A gifted triathlete has died after being hit by a car while taking part in a cycling race.

Junior Heffernan, 23, died on the third lap of 10 in the Severn Bridge Road Race in Gloucestershire, which was abandoned immediately.

His bike collided with a car heading in the opposite direction close to the village of Elberton yesterday but he died despite receiving emergency treatment at the scene.

Mr Heffernan, from Yelverton, Devon, 
had written of his 'renewed enthusiasm' for the sport at the start of a 
new cycling season just two days before he died.

He
posted a picture of his new team kit on the blog, called 'Ride with The
Heff', and said he would follow it up 'with some (hopefully) good news 
after the weekend!'.

Tributes were paid today to the talented sportsman who was competing in his first race for Team Herbalife-Leisure Lakes.

British
Cycling president Brian Cookson issued a statement following the news, 
saying: 'This is a tragedy which will profoundly sadden everyone 
associated with cycling in this country.

'My thoughts are with Junior's family and with his friends.'

Organisers of the event the Bristol Road Club described the incident as a 'terrible tragedy'.

As well as competing for his new team, Mr Heffernan also ran with Plymouth Harriers and swam with Plymouth Leander.

Jon
Rudd head coach of Plymouth Leander swimming club said Junior was a 
member for just a year but he described him as 'very committed, very 
hard working.'

He said: 'He wasn't really into triathlons at that time - he was more interested in being a swimmer.

'But I think the triathlon came out of that swimming, it being a third of the discipline.

'He was a very pleasant lad with a very nice family who were exceptionally supportive. It's a massive tragedy - such a shame.'

Karen Eccles, chairman of Plymouth Harriers said Junior often ran with the group and had made many friends amongst its runners.

She said: 'We saw him as a fellow Harrier because he's always done extremely well for us as a club, winning races.

'There was quite a few people who knew him and the news is quite a shock to us all.I had a couple of calls from members who were really close friends with him and they're really broken up.

'He was very keen and enthusiastic young man and enjoyed whatever he did, running or cycling.'

His training partner Plymouth-based triathlete Steve Ferguson added: 'He was such a talented athlete and bike rider. Hearing this news is like having my stomach torn out.

'His dad did everything he could for him to advance in sport.

'He even had a two lane, 50 metre long pool built in their back garden and we would train together.'

Mr Heffernan is said to have become a keen sportsman during his time at Kelly College in Tavistock competing for several teams at school.

He would often train on Dartmoor and is said to have travelled to Ethiopia to train with some of the world's best runners at altitude.

The race is regarded as one of the top races on the early UK cycling calendar.

Around 80 riders, some professional, complete 10 laps of the 6.6 mile circuit around South Gloucestershire.

Mr Heffernan is said to have been doing well in the race when he was killed.

Witnesses say that many of Mr Heffernan's fellow riders were visibly shaken when they returned to the race headquarters following the crash.

Avon and Somerset Police interviewed riders, officials and spectators in a bid to establish exactly what happened.

Officers are still appealing for information and no arrests have been made.
