Concerns have been raised that Egypt could descend into an Algerian-style civil war after thousands of people took to the 
streets to protest at the delayed result of the country's first
free presidential election.

Officials were supposed to declare a winner in Egypt's disputed election today. However, the President Election Commission said it needed more time to review complaints by the candidates.

But critics of the ruling military fear the Muslim Brotherhood - who most independent observers believe won the election - is being targeted by Egypt's generals to keep it out of the presidency.

The delay has sent political tensions soaring as the country awaits its first new president in three decades and sparked fears of a military coup.

Some observers have noted the similarity with Algeria 20 years ago when a
military-backed government blocked another Islamist group's ascent to 
power through the ballot box.

It led to the deaths of more than 150,000 Algerians during the 1990s.

But Saad al-Katatni, speaker of the short-lived democratic parliament dissolved by the ruling military council last week, said: 'What happened in Algeria cannot be repeated in Egypt.

'The Egyptian people are different and not armed,' the 
61-year-old microbiologist said.

'We are fighting a legal struggle via the establishment and a popular 
struggle in the streets.

Protest: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters chant slogans and one carries a poster with a picture of presidential candidate, Mohammed Morsi and Arabic that reads 'Mohammed Morsi, president for Egypt, revival is the will of the people'

'This is the ceiling. I see the 
continuation of the struggle in this way.'

He demanded the army recognize democracy but also offered conciliatory 
words: 'Everyone must submit to popular will.'

Last weekend's runoff election was long touted as a landmark moment - the choice of Egypt's first civilian president to take over from the generals who have ruled since Hosni Mubarak's removal on February 11, 2011.

The Algerian Civil War was a bloody conflict throughout the 1990's which is estimated to have cost more than 150,000 lives.

Many observers believe its beginnings were similar to the current 
situation in Egypt between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military 
rulers.

It began in 1991 when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party became popular among the people of Algeria.

This resulted in the National Liberation Front cancelling elections after the first round because it feared the FIS would win.

The president Chadli Bendjedid was forced from office and Algeria's military took control of the government.

This led to the FIS being banned and thousands of its members were arrested.

As a result Islamist guerrillas started an armed campaign against the government.

The conflict ended with the surrender of the Islamist Salvation Army and the defeat in 2002 of the Armed Islamic Group.

In total more than 70 journalists were assassinated during the conflict.

Instead, it has turned into a confrontation between the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and the entrenched elements of Mubarak's old regime - including the military.

Thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters camped out last night in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the birthplace of last year's uprising.

They were protesting against the 
delayed election result and also  denouncing new amendments to the 
constitution which gave The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) 
new powers last week.

The
Election Commission did not say when it would announce the winner of 
the runoff between the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Mohammed Morsi, 
and Mubarak's former prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq.

Both candidates claim they won, and the commission was supposed to declare the top vote-getter today.

But
its secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram 
that the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday.

Adding to the confusion and 
uncertainty were reports about the health of Hosni Mubarak, who is 
serving a life sentence for failing to stop the killing of protesters in
the uprising that ousted him last year.

At
one point on Tuesday, he was said to be near death, while some believed 
the report was a pretext by sympathetic allies of Mubarak to transfer 
him out of prison to a more comfortable facility.

The
commission said the announcement was postponed because a panel of 
judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by 
both campaigns.

The Brotherhood says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency, and that even if Morsi is declared the victor, he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern. 

After two days of voting that ended on Sunday, the group declared Morsi won 52 per cent of the vote.

Shafiq's camp on Monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote.

A group of independent jurists known as the Judges For Egypt said Morsi was the winner along with most newspapers.

Foreign and local election monitors say the runoff was not marked by enough serious or large-scale irregularities to question its validity.

In a series of swift moves last week, the generals cornered for themselves sweeping powers that effectively subordinate the next president and severely limit his capability for independent action.

A court order dissolved parliament, which was led by the Brotherhood, and the military issued a constitutional declaration that makes the generals the nation's legislators and gives them control of the budget.

They will dominate the security system after reshaping a key National Defense Council to keep it under their control. The generals will also oversee the process of writing Egypt's new constitution.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. expects the military to 'support the democratic transition, to recede by turning over authority.'

'The military has to assume an appropriate role, which is not to try to interfere with, dominate or subvert the constitutional authority,' she said.

Privately, U.S. officials have expressed concern that a Shafiq victory could have dangerous fallout, with protests and ensuing instability that could lead the military to take even stronger measures.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

While the Brotherhood and secular revolutionary groups have denounced the military's moves, some Egyptian liberals see the steps as a way to prevent an Islamist takeover by the 82-year-old Muslim Brotherhood, or ensure that its hold on power is difficult and temporary. 

'I see the military council at this point as a protector of the identity of the state against the Brotherhood, who are not a purely Egyptian party, but an international one,' said Emad Gad, a member of the liberal Free Egyptians party.

He cited celebrations in Gaza Strip ruled by the Palestinian Islamic Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, when news broke of Morsi's victory claims. 

Anti-Islamist figures and others seen as backers of the military were escalating rhetoric against the Brotherhood on TV talk shows, accusing the group of seeking to set up a 'parallel state' or of forming armed militias.

Others defended the military, saying the generals had to protect Egypt from destabilizing changes.

Further raising the tone and sense of confusion, rumors circulated on social media sites and even some state-run media of tanks moving on the outskirts of Cairo, although the reports could not be confirmed. 

'It is clear that there is sharp polarization between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood,' said Islamist Montasser el-Zayat, a prominent rights lawyer and activist. 'It suggests that the next few days will probably be difficult for Egypt and the Egyptians.'

Uncertainty: Adding to the confusion were reports about the health of former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. At one point on Tuesday he was said to be near death

The Brotherhood has warned that a win by Shafiq, widely seen as an extension of the Mubarak regime, could only be the result of fraud and that it would send its supporters out onto the streets.

Still, the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Khairat el-Shater, sought to defuse fears that the group would resort to violence if Shafiq is declared the winner, saying the Brotherhood will use peaceful means, 'not through violence or terrorism.'

Shafiq's campaign sought to appeal to the international community, holding a news conference in English for foreign correspondents to send a message that it will accept 'whatever the outcome.'

Basil el-Baz, an adviser to Shafiq, said the campaign was confident he was the winner. But he added, 'At the end of the day, candidate Shafiq is willing to accept the results regardless of the outcomes.'

'In the event that candidate Morsi is indeed successful and victorious in the elections, the first phone he will receive will be from candidate Shafiq,' el-Baz said.

Adding to the electoral limbo has been the murkiness over the state of Mubarak's health.

The 84-year-old former leader has been said to be in poor health since his ouster, even appearing at his trial in a hospital bed.

On Tuesday, state media reported he had suffered a stroke and was put on life support. Security officials said Wednesday that he was in a coma but off life support and that his heart and other vital organs were functioning. 

Security officials said he had been moved from his prison where he has been kept since his June 2 conviction to a military hospital overlooking the Nile in Cairo - a transfer that could stir up anger among opponents of the regime.

Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was at his bedside in the hospital. The security officials said a team of 15 doctors, including heart, blood and brain specialists, was supervising his care.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The conflicting reports raised suspicions among some of Mubarak's opponents that the rumors were intended to justify the move to hospital - something his lawyers have sought.

'There are attempts to spoil the political scene,' the Brotherhood's el-Shater said, citing 'a fierce campaign of black rumors all across the country.'
