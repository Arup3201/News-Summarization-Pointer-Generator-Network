Double FIFA Women's World Player of the Year Mia Hamm and Boston Bruins president Cam Neely have been nominated to Roma’s board of directors.

Serie A club Roma is traded on the Milan stock exchange and the nominations were made at a club shareholder meeting.

Hamm, 42, helped the United States to two World Cup titles, including the inaugural edition in 1991 in China.

Neely, 49, was an ice hockey forward for Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins, before becoming the Bruins’ president in 2010.

Roma was bought by a group of four Boston executives three years ago and Richard D’Amore, a member of that group, rejoined the board. Former club president Thomas DiBenedetto and New York lawyer Joe Tacopina, who recently became president of second-division club Bologna, left the board.

American investor Stanley Gold was also nominated. 

The 13 board members serve three-year terms.
