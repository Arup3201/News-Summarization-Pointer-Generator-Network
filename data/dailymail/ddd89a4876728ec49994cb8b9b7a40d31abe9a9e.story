His films taught us that - provided you can put up with a car chase, a swim in an eel-infested pond or a mad dash along London's Southbank - love, actually, will always find a way.

But Richard Curtis has revealed that he felt compelled to write his happily-ever-after romantic comedies because of a personal heartbreak - and named the woman at who caused it.

The director, whose works include Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings And A Funeral, said his student girlfriend Carolyn Colquhoun 'broke my heart spectacularly, as a result of which I wrote about unbroken hearts for ten years'.

Muse: Richard Curtis, left, with Carolyn Colquhoun

Miss Colquhoun - now Mrs Carolyn Morton-Hooper and married to solicitor Anthony Morton-Hooper who represented Lord Archer during his 2001 trial for perjury - met Curtis at Oxford University where they both studied in the 1970s.

Curtis - who is now promoting his latest film About Time - was reading English Language and Literature and Miss Colquhoun was studying history.

She also dated Rowan Atkinson, who has since appeared in several of Curtis's films - although it is believed this was before her 12-month relationship with Curtis.

Curtis, who now lives in Notting Hill with his partner, the broadcaster Emma Freud, told Time Out magazine that Miss Colquhoun was the fourth girl he fell in love with.

'I owe her my movie career,' he said.

Now 56, also admitted to having his first crush when he was eight years old - perhaps inspiring the younger love birds in his films such as Sam in Love Actually (played by Thomas Sangster), who falls deeply in love with an American girl at his school.

This was the first time that Curtis has named his muse, although he previously mentioned a student heartbreak.

'I fell in love, and that dominated my second year; and then I got heartbroken and that dominated the next year,' he said.

Curtis, who is now promoting his latest film About Time, said he had also been besotted with actresses Julie Andrews and Sylvia Kristel.

The now father-of-four - Scarlett, 18, Jake, 16, Charlie, 11, and Spike, nine - said that losing 'the girl who you couldn't get to love you quite enough' had inspired him to write films that made 'love affairs turn out right, to try to make up for what happened'.

Mrs Morton-Hooper - who has four children aged between 21 and 26 - yesterday refused to disclose why she had broken up with the budding director, adding: 'I could tell you lots of anecdotes but I won't'.

The 59-year-old admitted that she had not spoken to Curtis for years and had no idea that the break-up had affected him so deeply, saying: 'I'd quite like a word with him now.'

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I think I was Richard's first girlfriend and you always remember your first love because it's very special.

'But I don't know about breaking his heart. We were young, just students at the time.

'Richard was always a star, even at university. His career was always going to be successful. I don't think I can take any credit for kick starting it.

Now a history teacher, Mrs Morton-Hooper enjoyed a brief acting career, appearing in several television shows between 1983 and 1992 including an 
episode of Blackadder. 

She also played roles in Agatha Christie’s 
Poirot, The Bill, and TV adaptations 
of Anthony Price’s Cold War Killers and The Alamut Ambush.

Her husband is a partner at legal firm Mishcon de Reya.

Her son William, 23, said: 'My mum, Rowan and Richard were at university together, but Rowan had nothing to do with their break-up. In fact I think she dated Rowan before Richard.'

Mrs Morton-Hooper's youngest son Freddie appeared in Handmade Tales, a play for children, this summer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - where Curtis and Atkinson had their break in 1979.

Penning a review of the show online, Mrs Morton-Hooper wrote: 'I am totally biased, having a son in the show, but it was fantastic.

'Full of energy, each member of the cast was ideally suited to their roles and although child-friendly, the play was thought-provoking for any age.'
