Elderly people in care homes are being treated roughly and suffering 'worrying bruises with no explanation', according to the chief inspector.

Andrea Sutcliffe, of the Care Quality Commission, said that 'some truly awful care' was being uncovered 'week in, week out' during inspections.

She revealed that her inspectors had discovered patients with dementia who had life-threatening dehydration and malnutrition because staff were not helping them.

Elsewhere, residents were being dressed in someone else's clothes that did not fit because care workers were too busy to find the right ones.

This week the watchdog will begin inspecting all 25,000 care homes in England using a new system which will see them given Ofsted-style ratings. Teams of inspectors, including experts in dementia care, will grade them as outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate. The worst could be closed down.

Miss Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the commission, has told inspectors to apply the 'mum test' when evaluating homes: would they leave their own parents there?

She added: 'Week in, week out, our inspectors discover some truly awful care which should not be happening. Sometimes it is abuse – older people treated roughly, worrying bruises that have no explanation.

'Sometimes it is neglect – people living with dementia not supported to eat and drink so they end up with malnutrition or life-threatening dehydration. Sometimes it is a shocking lack of respect for people's dignity – dressed in someone else's clothes that don't fit, men not having a regular shave because staff are too busy, no one taking the time to find out what makes you happy or just talk to you.

'It can all add up to a thoroughly miserable and frightening experience for people often in the most vulnerable of circumstances.

'One person told us, 'I find it a terrible place: it's a diabolical place. It stinks.' '

She added: 'Too often we find services that need to change but the people using those services are putting up with awful care and say 'it's not perfect' or 'the staff are very good; you get the odd one but you can't help that'.

'We have to be clear that putting up with poor care is not what anybody is expected to do.

'And let's not forget, it doesn't just affect the individual – it affects the whole family. Sometimes, the worst part of the letters I read is the distress and guilt the family feel when they discover the service they trusted had betrayed the people they cared about. It can be truly heartbreaking.

'These examples of failing care and their impact just reinforce my determination to make sure we call time on poor care.'

The Care Quality Commission said that its new inspections system is designed to ensure inspectors are 'consistent when making judgments' and would 'help care providers understand' how ratings are being awarded.

Miss Sutcliffe added: 'Ratings characteristics are an important part of our new approach to inspecting and rating adult social care.

'They will allow our inspectors to really get under the skin of adult social care services so that providers know what we are expecting and how we will consistently rate their services. I am sure that this will mean people can be confident in the judgments our inspections will make.'
