Cardiff Blues have announced that Wales international centre Owen Williams continues to make progress after suffering a serious spinal cord injury in June.

Blues player Williams, 22, has been at the Welsh Spinal Injuries and Neurological Rehabilitation Unit since early July, where he continues his long-term recovery and rehabilitation.

In a statement, the Blues said: 'Owen is now tolerating periods of time sitting up in a wheelchair, allowing him the chance to spend short periods of time outside the hospital.

'He is also starting to use the gym at the hospital for early upper limb rehabilitation.

'It remains very early in his recovery, but support for the £StayStrongForOws campaign worldwide has been a huge inspiration for Owen, his family and friends.

'Over 14,000 £StayStrongForOws wristbands have now been sold and fundraising continues, in association with the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, to support Owen.'

Williams, who has won four Wales caps, was hurt during the first-half of the Blues' defeat against Asia Pacific Dragons in a World Club 10s play-off game in Singapore.
