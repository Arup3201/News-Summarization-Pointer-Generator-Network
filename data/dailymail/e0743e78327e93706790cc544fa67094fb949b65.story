The arrival of your first baby is a massive moment for any mother.

For Lara Carpenter-Beck, the enormousness of it was all too plain to see.

Her baby bump swelled to 55 inches, she piled on 6st 9lb, shot up five dress sizes… and even feared she would be crushed by the weight when she lay on her back.

Lara gained an astonishing 6 and a half stone whilst pregnant with her first child but lost the entirity of her weight within the first year

‘At just 
12 weeks people were asking me when I was due – I was that big,’ the 
29-year-old artist said yesterday. ‘And my bump just kept growing and 
growing.

‘It was my first pregnancy so I had no idea what to expect but I knew it wasn’t normal to grow at the rate I was.’

Average
 weight gain in pregnancy, inclusive of the baby, the fluid around it 
and the enlargement of the womb, is between one-and-a-half and two 
stone.

Mrs
 Carpenter-Beck is 5ft7in and a size 12. She was diagnosed with type 1 
diabetes – which occurs when the body fails to produce insulin and is 
not linked to obesity – in 2011 a week before marrying property agent 
husband Chris, 38.

Lara says that her bump was so big that people were asking her due date at just 12 weeks

She
 knew that diabetes sufferers are prone to gaining weight in pregnancy 
but even so was shocked at just how big she became as she was careful 
about her portion sizes. At 32 weeks, a nurse told her that her baby 
already weighed 6lb – not far off the average weight of a full-term baby
 (7lb 6oz for girls) even though she was still eight weeks away from her
 due date. ‘It was really hard carrying around all of the weight when I 
wasn’t used to it,’ she said.

‘Even
 sleeping was a problem and my bump was so big I couldn’t lie on my 
front, and when I lay on my back I felt like I was being crushed under 
the weight.’

At
 36 weeks she weighed 18st and had to wear size 22 clothes because 
normal maternity wear would not fit around her huge bump, which then 
measured 55 inches in circumference. When her waters suddenly broke she 
was rushed in to hospital for a Caesarean section. She and her husband 
were relieved when daughter Savannah was born healthy – at a bouncing 
9lb 5oz.

Mrs
 Carpenter-Beck, from Bristol, said she worried about regaining her 
figure but lost the weight in a year with the help of Slimming World. 
She shed a stone in the first week after the birth and another in the 
second. She added: ‘I couldn’t believe how big I became, but it hasn’t 
put me off having another one. It’s all worth it to have a healthy 
baby.’

Lara's weight gain meant that baby Savannah was born slightly heavier than the average baby girl at 9lbs 5oz

Lara is delighted to be back to her svelte size 12 figure and is looking forward to hitting the high street

Lara says that her weight gain during her first pregnancy has not put her off having another child and says the discomfort was entirely worth it

Lara says that even if she got twice as big as last time she would do it all again for another baby
