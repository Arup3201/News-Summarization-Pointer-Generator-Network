A businessman, his wife and their four children were killed on Thursday when their small plane crashed into a swampy area of central Florida.

Ron Bramlage, 45, his wife, Rebecca, 43, and the 
couple's children - Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and 8-year-old 
Roxanne - were killed as they were heading home to Junction City, Kansas from the Bahamas.

Ron Bramlage, who owned Roadside Ventures LLC, was piloting the 2006
Pilatus Pc-12/47, a single-turboprop, fixed-wing 
plane, when it broke 
apart and went down about 12.30pm in the Tiger Creek Preserve.

Sad: The couple's children Brandon, Boston, Beau and Roxanne also died as the family headed home to Junction City, Kansas from the Bahamas

Deputies reached the area by 
helicopters, but it was clear there were no survivors, the sheriff's 
office said.

The cause of the crash was not immediately known, and parts 
of the plane were found nearly three and a half miles away, investigators said.

Word quickly spread to the family's hometown where the family was known for their charitable work and always having a house full of neighborhood kids.

'It's just a horrific loss,' Junction
City Mayor Pat Landes said, adding that the couple supported many local
projects and provided college scholarships. The family was well known 
in town and at Kansas State University, where the basketball arena is 
named for Ron Bramlage's grandfather.

At least two dozen bouquets of flowers 
lined the black wrought-iron fence surrounding the family's ranch-style 
home by Thursday evening. A trampoline sat in the front lawn, and a 
hammock hung between two large trees in the wooded yard.

Standing in his front yard across the
street, Rick Bazan said he had been friends with Ron Bramlage since 
childhood. He said his friend would often help local families 
financially, such as paying for kids to go to wrestling camps if their 
parents couldn't afford to send them.

'Long time': The community where the family lived said it will be difficult to deal with the loss as they were known for their charitable work and always having a house full of neighborhood kids

He said Rebecca, who was president of the local school board, 'never stopped working. She was tireless.' She would be embarrassed by the outpouring of support now at her home, where at least a half-dozen friends of the couple's children were always running around, Bazan said.

'It's going to be a long time getting over this one,' he said as he watched the family's neighbors and friends gather outside.

Bella Omann, 14, who went to middle school with the two younger boys, said Beau 'was really the funniest kid I've ever met.'

She had an advanced geometry class with Boston, whom she said 'loved reading books. We would always talk about our favorite books,' including the Harry Potter novels. He read so much, she said, that their teacher wouldn't allow extra material on students' desks to keep him from reading.

Another neighbor, Joann Williams, recalled driving by the home and seeing the children bouncing on the trampoline. 'They were just a beautiful family. They were just so together, cohesive,' she said.

The couple were graduates of Kansas State University and members of the K-State Alumni Association, President's Club, Foundation Trustees and Ahearn Fund.

'The Bramlage family holds a special place in the history of Kansas State University and K-State Athletics, and Ron and Becky have been loyal supporters and great fans of K-State. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bramlage family during this difficult time,' University President Kirk Schulz and Athletics Director John Currie said in a joint statement.

Ron was the grandson of the late Fred Bramlage, a 1935 graduate of K-State and Junction City businessman. Fred Bramlage was the lead contributor to the construction of Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that opened in 1988 and is home to the K-State men's and women's basketball teams.

A library in the city is named for Ron Bramlage's grandmother, Dorothy Bramlage.

Unclear: The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, and parts of the plane were found miles away

Ron Walker, superintendent of the local school district, said the family was down-to-earth despite their wealth and famous name. He said Rebecca, along with heading the school board, was a board member of the local school foundation.

'I've been here about 10 years now. She and Ron, they were among the first people to greet me. I didn't even know they had any wealth at all for about five years. It was just, "How can we help you, how can we serve?'''

The 4,900-acre Tiger Creek Preserve about 50 miles southwest of Orlando contains hardwood swamps, hammocks, scrubby flatwoods, pine flatwoods, sandhill and longleaf pine/wiregrass habitat, according to its website.

The crash site was only reachable by helicopters and all-terrain vehicles. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation, which the Federal Aviation Administration said would take a long time. The family had stopped for customs in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had taken off half an hour before the crash.
