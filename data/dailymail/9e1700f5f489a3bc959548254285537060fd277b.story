Liverpool players ramped up their preparations ahead of the crucial top-four showdown with fierce rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday. 

The Reds are currently fifth in the Premier League table with 54 points, just two behind United in fourth.

Having both spent heavily in the summer transfer window, both teams are under huge pressure to secure Champions League football next season and while previous meetings between the two sides may have been contested higher up the table, this year's encounter still has plenty at stake, given the broadcasting revenue linked to Europe's top club competition.

All too aware of what is at stake is Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge, who believes that three points and momentum in the race for a top-four finish will render the local bragging rights associated with the fixture as incidental.     

He told Liverpoolfc.com: 'Of course, it's a rivalry, but it's another three points and we'll just approach the game as we always do - that's the most important thing.

'It's going to be a big game for us. We're going into the game looking to win it, as we always do, and we're looking forward to it.

'We'll go into this game with the right mentality, we'll look to play our football and to try to go out there and win the game.

Meanwhile, Sturridge was full of praise for attacking dynamo Philippe Countinho, whose development this season have been central to an upturn in form for Liverpool, who have not lost in their last 13 league games, since the 3-0 defeat by United in December.

On Coutinho, Sturridge said, 'He's great to play with. He's very skilful, sees a pass and scores very nice goals, also, so it's a pleasure to play with him.

'He's quite chilled, he's not too loud. He has a little bit of a joke, but he's just a relaxed, calm guy. He comes in and does his work and is humble, just like everyone else is.

'I think it's down to him to work as hard as he possibly can to get to where he wants to be - and I am sure he wants to aim for the stars.

'That's very possible with the attributes he has, so as long as he continues doing what he's doing, I'm sure he'll go a long way in the game.'
