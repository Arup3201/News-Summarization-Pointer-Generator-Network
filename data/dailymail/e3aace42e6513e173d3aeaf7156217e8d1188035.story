An inmate at a notoriously lax open jail was caught trying to smuggle a rabbit inside to keep as a pet.

The prisoner at Hollesley Bay open prison in Woodbridge, Suffolk, is thought to have found the animal while outside on day release.

He was able to bring the rabbit back inside the prison - nicknamed Holiday Bay because its laid-back regime - where convicts managed to build it a hutch and started treating it as a prison pet.

Prison wardens eventually found and confiscated the rabbit, then gave it to a rescue centre.

The inmate is thought to have found the rabbit roaming wild, as opposed to taking it from a previous owner. It is unclear whether the pet was kept in one prisoner's room or elsewhere in the jail.

He has since been disciplined for the breach, which took place several weeks ago.

A Hollesley Bay spokesman said today that it 'wouldn't be hard' for an inmate to smuggle an animal into the prison.

She said: 'This is the country, there are dozens of brown rabbits sitting all round the prison as well as other animals like muntjac deer.

'If someone wanted to pick one up and take it back to their room it wouldn't be hard but as soon as it would have been found it would have been moved swiftly along.'

Dennis Driver, Chairman of Hollesley Parish Council, said: 'The prisoners seem to just walk in and out as they like.

'They aren't allowed sharp items or animals but who knows if they are checked. The security does seem to be a bit lax. I'm sure all sorts of stuff is smuggled in there.

'I think the prisoners would just do it for a laugh. Rabbits come up to you and they probably just picked it up and took it in there. 

The rabbit fiasco is the latest in a string of embarrassments for Hollesley Bay, which last week the target of a bizarre theft.

Low security: The jail in Suffolk is mocked by inmates because of its lax regime

An audacious thief broke into the jail, slipping through a skylight to steal £3,000 of tobacco meant to be sold to inmates.  

The cache was stolen from the prison's main storeroom in a late-night raid before it could be sold to convicts. Police hunting the culprits are understood to have found a shoe print near the scene.

The tobacco was taken between 4.30pm on Monday, June 16 and 8am on Tuesday, June 17.

Suffolk Police said up to 300 packets were taken.

A prison spokesman said: 'Earlier this month a quantity of tobacco products was stolen from HMP Hollesley Bay. This is now a matter for the police.'
