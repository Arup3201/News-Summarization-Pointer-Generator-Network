Deadly accident: Rosa Irene Ayala-Gaona, 52, suffered multiple traumatic injuries and extensive trauma to her torso

The passenger killed while riding a Texas roller coaster was ejected from her seat and plummeted about 75 feet before striking a metal beam, a coroner has revealed.

The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office released additional details on Tuesday about the death of 52-year-old Rosa Irene Ayala-Gaona.

She was found dead on Friday night at the Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in suburban Dallas.

The official cause of death remains pending, but the office said the Dallas woman's body was found atop a ride tunnel for the 14-story 'Texas Giant' rollercoaster.

The coroner said Ayala-Gaona was ejected from her third-row seat as the ride began a steep descent along the track's first large hill.

An autopsy showed she suffered multiple traumatic injuries and extensive trauma to her torso.

The accident happened on the ‘Texas Giant’ ride at the Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in Arlington at around 6.45pm on Friday.

The Putman family, from Rockwell, were stood in line for the ride behind Ayala-Gaona and her family.

‘They were laughing and talking,’ John Putman recalled.

The
Putmans did not see the accident, but Darlene Putman said the woman’s 
son, a man in his 20s, was clearly distraught after the roller coaster 
returned to the loading platform.

‘He was saying, “She fell! she fell!”’ Mrs Putman recalled.

According to the witnesses, the frantic son attempted to race to the tracks, but was stopped and turned away by park employees.

Dallas Morning News reported that on his Facebook page, Mrs Ayala-Gaona's grownup son, Amado Esparza, described his late mother as adventuresome and said that she had been having a good time at the amusement park Friday, which was her first - and last - visit there.

‘I’ve never discovered a day as long as this one. It’s very sad that I lost my mom, but I’m happy that I was able to enjoy her to the maximum while she was alive,’ Amado wrote.

Neighbors in the Oak Cliff neighborhood told the paper that the woman lived with her husband, Antonio, and their children: Amado, a teenage son and at least one daughter.

Maria Padron said that Mrs Ayala-Gaona was very devout and held bible study classes in her home. 

One witness told The Dallas News that the woman had gotten on the ride with her son and that they believe she mustn’t have been strapped in correctly.

Witness Carmen Brown told reporters, 'they didn't secure her right. One of the employees from the park - one 
of the ladies - she asked her to click her more than once, and they were
like, "As long you heard it click, you're OK."

'Everybody else is like, "Click, click, click." Hers only clicked once. Hers was the only one 
that went down once, and she didn't feel safe, but they let her still 
get on the ride.'

Witnesses who saw Mrs Ayala-Gaona tumble from the ride directed paramedics to the location of her body.

'She
goes up like this. Then when it drops to come down, that's when it (the
safety bar) released and she just tumbled,' said Brown, of Arlington. 
Brown said she was waiting in line to get on the ride when the accident 
happened.

A witness told Fox DFW
that she saw the safety bar secure normally before the ride began and 
that when it returned it was in the normal down position. Officials have
not yet determined if the restraint came loose, causing the woman to 
fall.

People waiting in line for the roller coaster said park employees asked them to get out of line after the accident. The park closed an area of Six Flags around the area of the accident.

'The cars came in and there was a man and a woman in the front," Gabe Flores told CNN, 'the man was saying, 'let me out, let me out, my mom fell off.'

'There's a turn that's pretty steep, and the person behind her empty seat said she... just flew out,' Flores added.

Officials at Six Flags have not yet revealed details about the woman's death, but released the following statement: ‘We are deeply saddened to share that earlier this evening an adult woman died in the park while on the Texas Giant.

‘Park medical staff and local paramedics responded immediately. Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation,’ said Sharon Parker, communications manager for Six Flags Over Texas.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends during this difficult time.’

Emergency crews had to use a ladder truck to reach the victim's body, according. Once recovered, her body was taken away by a 'funeral home vehicle.'

The Texas Giant roller coaster 
debuted as an all-wooden ride in 1990, and reopened in 2011 redesigned 
with a steel track during the theme park's 50th anniversary. The ride's 
tallest height is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet.

This
is the park’s second fatality. In 1999, a 28-year-old Arkansas woman 
died and 10 others were injured when a boat capsized on the Roaring 
Rapids ride.

In 2006, 
nine park patrons were injured on the Texas Tornado when one of the 
mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned.
