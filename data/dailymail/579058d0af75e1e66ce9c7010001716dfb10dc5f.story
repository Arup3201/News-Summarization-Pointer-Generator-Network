Missing millionaire Guma Aguiar left his wedding ring behind following a fight with his wife before  boarding his speedboat for trip that ended in his apparent death, it has been revealed.

New evidence shows that Aguiar removed the band and his watch but took religious texts - which coast guards noted he did not usually carry - with him when he went for a ride on his 31-foot boat.

The oil tycoon vanished on June 19 and is at the center of a controversy over whether he is really dead or faked his death to avoid losing his $100million fortune.

His estate is now at the center of a legal battle between his wife and his mother, who believes he may still be alive.

'I can only speculate that when he 
left the house, he was upset and took things that gave him solace,' 
Aguiar's mother Ellen told the Sun-Sentinel.

The Coast Guard logs, which were made public via a Freedom of Information Act request, included a partial note saying the mogul was 'not in a good frame of mind due to financial... [sic]' when he left his house on the evening of June 19.

One of the other poignant notes in the files was 'Argument w/ wife over divorce… left watch, wedding ring'.

Police warn that such personal details are not considered facts in the case, but were pieces of evidence compiled through various interviews during the Coast Guard's search for the missing man within the first 48 hours of his disappearance.

One other fact noted in their findings was that all of the personal flotation devices typically stored on the boat were accounted for when the boat, named the T.T. Zion, was found having run aground on a Fort Lauderdale beach with the lights on and its engine on full throttle.

The authorities focused largely on the
 logistical evidence that they have to work with based on the GPS data 
recorded by his boat before it crashed.

It was barreling northeast around 
31mph for around half an hour before abruptly slowing down to about 
0.6mph and making an about-face, new GPS data show.

The data, released by detectives after
 they closed their active investigation, reveal Aguiar’s last journey 
before his disappearance, showing that the boat the magnate was 
driving never came to a complete stop, which has led officials to speculate 
that he could have jumped onto another boat.

According to ABC News, the GPS data 
begins tracking Aguiar at 7.29pm after he had left the inlet by his 
house. He travelled northeast for nearly 30 minutes at high speeds into 
the open ocean.

At 7.56pm, the 31-foot vessel suddenly made an ominously abrupt turn, slowing to speeds below 3mph.

Certified marine surveyor Henry Pickersgill told MailOnline that Aguiar’s disappearance is still a mystery, though the GPS data does divulge several interesting bits of information.

‘There are some trends, there’s a pattern we can see with the boat,’ he said. ‘I think he got off. The path shows tracks north, some jags here or there, then there was an abrupt drop off in speed, according to the data.

‘The longitude on the data shows pretty static movement for about two minutes. There’s a drift pattern on the boat. And if he got off, that’s where he would have gotten off.’

The T.T. Zion, the boat that Guma Aguiar was thought to be piloting when he went missing is now being held at a police warehouse in Fort Lauderdale

Though Mr Pickersgill is not directly involved in the investigation, he called the millionaire’s path unusual, adding: ‘I don’t think it’s inconsistent with his profile. It’s a little bit unusual, but I don’t think it’s inconsistent with his profile. We’re looking to apply some good guesses to hard data.’

Fort Lauderdale police still do not suspect foul play, though facts revealed about Aguiar following his disappearance show he had had a difficult few months.

In addition to battling with her son's wife for control of his estimated $100million fortune, Aguiar's mother hopes that her son may still be alive, wandering the streets of Fort Lauderdale after experiencing a nervous breakdown.

In a petition filed to a Florida court to seize his $100million fortune, Ellen Aguiar stated that her son 'may be in a delusional state or be suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.'
