Georgina Martin, 46, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, claims her daughter's father is Jimmy Savile after he abused her when she was a teenager

A 29-year-old woman fears she could be Jimmy Savile's secret daughter after her mother was sexually abused by the paedophile DJ.

The woman, who has not been named, claims her mother - Georgina Martin – was abused by the former Radio 1 DJ when she was just 13-years-old.

Ms Martin, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said disgraced Savile had sex with her more than 20 times over a three-year period but ended the relationship when she discovered she was pregnant.

The now 46-year-old conceived her daughter when she was 16-years-old and, despite having sex with another boyfriend during the same period, believes Savile could be the child's father.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I have carried the terrible secret that my child is likely to belong to Jimmy Savile for three decades.

'Now I have found the strength to speak out because we need to have a test to draw a line under this for her sake.'

Ms Martin's daughter grew up with bright blonde hair, dark eyes and distinctive cheekbones – bearing some resemblance to Savile.

She has now been given the news by her mother that she may well be Savile's child – and is demanding a DNA test to try and determine the true identity of her father.

She told the newspaper: 'I want to know the truth, but I hope to God I was not fathered by that man.

'It would be the worst nightmare imaginable to find out Jimmy Savile was my dad.'

The mother and daughter have now asked detectives from Operation Yewtree for help in obtaining DNA from Savile's family to try and aid their paternity test.

Ms Martin claims she was groomed after first being approached by Savile outside Leeds railway station in February 1982.

She said she 'instantly recognised' him from Jim'll Fix It and Top of the Pops and said the former DJ asked her if she fancied a cup of tea.

She said he later asked for her phone number, which she handed over, and called her three weeks later to enquire about meeting up.

After agreeing, she was collected by a man she claims was called 'Vince' – the name of Savile's older brother – and was taken to a penthouse flat on the outskirts of Leeds.

Ms Martin claims she was approached by the former DJ outside Leeds Railway Station when she was 13-years-old and later invited to his three-bedroom apartment (above), where they had sex on several occasions

Ms Martin said she was driven to the luxury apartment block in Leeds  where Savile once lived (pictured) and it was there that he had sex with her in the bathroom. They went on to meet up  20 more times in three years

She said the pair discussed his charity work at the three-bedroom flat, which was 'cluttered' and full of framed pictures of himself with other high-profile faces such as Prince Charles. They did not have sex on this occasion.

Ms Martin claims she was then called by Savile a few weeks later, just before her 14th birthday, who said she should meet up with him to celebrate her upcoming birthday.

She said she was again picked up and taken to his flat, where she was allegedly plied with alcohol before Savile had sex with her in the bathroom.

The liaisons went on for more than three years, until March 1985 when Ms Martin informed Savile that she was pregnant.

She said: 'At the time I was seeing Savile as well as a boyfriend closer to my age. I did have sex with both of them in the same month but I always knew it was Savile's child.'

She gave birth in the December of that year and put her boyfriend's name on the birth certificate.

However, she said she always made it clear that he was not her daughter's real father.

In response, the boyfriend – who is now aged 52 and lives near Pontefract, West Yorkshire – said he believes he still is the father and claims he had 'never heard that she even knew Jimmy Savile.'

A report published last summer charted how Savile became the most prolific sex attacker in living memory.

The mass of NHS reports into his crimes revealed how the DJ boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes which he had removed from their bodies.

The paedophile also gloated to others that he enjoyed 'posing' with the corpses and said that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds General Infirmary.

Savile was revealed to be the most prolific sex attacker in living memory following his death in October 2011

Investigators discovered that the late TV presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75.

Starstruck NHS workers allowed Savile free reign to sexually abuse patients and hospital staff 'didn't want to hear or believe' what his young victims were saying, the report said.

They detailed his 50-year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital.

The reports outlined in unprecedented detail the sordid crimes he committed between 1962 and 2009.

They revealed how he used his charming and manipulative personality to open the doors of hospitals and access their most vulnerable patients.

He also used his fundraising activities as a cover to further his predatory sexual attacks, which targeted men and women, staff and patients.

Since his death in October 2011, dozens of victims have come out to say they were abused by the disgraced television presenter and several investigations have been carried out to determine how his abuse went unknown for so long.
