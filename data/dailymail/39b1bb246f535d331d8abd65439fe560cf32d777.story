Most of England gathered in prayer to help mend David Beckham’s metatarsal in 2002 - now the whole of Colombia is willing star striker Radamel Falcao to make his own miracle recovery from injury.

Colombia has been waiting for Falcao’s knee to improve since he damaged ligaments playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January.

A final decision on whether or not he will go to the World Cup will not be made until Sunday, when the team’s Argentine coach Jose Pekerman finalises his 23-man squad.

Star man: The whole of Colombia are praying Radamel Falcao will recover from injury in time for the World Cup

Setback: England gathered in prayer back in 2002 after David Beckham broke his metatarsal playing for Manchester United against Deportivo La Coruna in the Champions League following a tackle from Aldo Duscher

Falcao, who scored nine goals in 13 
matches as Colombia finished  second to Argentina in the South American 
qualifying group, said: ‘The reaction in Colombia to my recuperation 
really made an impact on me. It has reminded me how important I am for 
the country. I wouldn’t say it has put more pressure on me. It’s more a 
case of an extra motivation - wanting to do things not just for me but 
for all the people who willed me to get fit.

‘The closer the World Cup gets, the more I am thinking I don’t want to be just watching in Brazil. I have worked hard to make sure that is not going to be the case but with an injury it’s not just how hard you work, it’s also how patient and calm you can be.’ 

England fans will continue to watch his recuperation carefully. If Colombia emerge from Group C, which features Greece, Japan and Ivory Coast, they could face Roy Hodgson’s team in the second round.

It would be a repeat of the 1998 World Cup group game when Glenn Hoddle’s England brushed aside one of Colombia’s best-ever teams in the Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens. 

‘I remember watching the England game with my dad,’ said Falcao. ‘Darren Anderton scored and David Beckham scored with a free-kick and we were going home early again. 

‘We have paid the price in the past for not being as advanced in many areas of the game as other  countries. That has left us poorly prepared for big tournaments but now, with so many Colombian players playing in big clubs all over the world, that has changed. We have improved our mentality.’

If his knee stays strong, Falcao could benefit from being sidelined for so long. 

‘I don’t come into the tournament with the weight of a long season in my legs so that could be an advantage,’ he said. ‘Providing my knee is fine, the rest of me is well rested and fresh.’

To get out of the group Colombia may have to get past the Ivory Coast and one of Falcao’s striking references, Didier Drogba. ‘It’s no surprise that he is still there at the top,’ said Falcao. ‘If you are as professional as he has always been and you look after yourself you extend your career at the top.

‘We have a real chance in this group because it’s even.’

Not that Falcao believes Colombia merit their shorter odds than England going into the tournament.

‘You underestimate yourselves,’ he said. ‘I see England as favourites with Germany and Spain in terms of the European contenders and obviously Argentina and Brazil from South America. I would put England ahead of ourselves in terms of favourites. 

‘You have one of the best leagues in the world and it’s extremely competitive, so the players who play in it are elite players. Maybe they would benefit from a little emigration as well, to experience other leagues.’

Falcao shunned the Premier League for a lucrative contract at Monaco last summer, but the 28-year-old says he will end up in England one day.

‘I hope to be playing for many more years in Europe and I want to play in the English league at some time,’ he said. ‘I watch the Premier League and I see how competitive it is and how teams are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition’s goal. The football is very physical; it’s a very interesting league.’

Time will tell if it is attractive enough to tempt Falcao; next season he will be playing for Monaco in the Champions League. ‘It is very important to be playing in this competition. I know that people want to see me competing in the Champions League,’ he said. 

He also understands why people questioned his decision last year to move to a club who average crowds of under 15,000. He scored 52 goals in 67 games for Atletico Madrid but justifies the switch to Monaco, saying: ‘Everyone decides what he wants for his own life. Everyone has to do what they think is best for them. When you are a professional sportsman you always want to win regardless.’ 

There must have been some regret at witnessing Atletico enjoy such a superb season.

No regrets: Falcao says he was overjoyed to see former club Atletico Madrid win La Liga and reach the Champions League final this season

‘I’m a little bit surprised at just how well they played and I’m overjoyed at what they have achieved,’ he said. ‘Diego Costa had an incredible season. He was decisive when he needed to be in the league. People say we are similar because we played the same position in the same team but they forget we also played together last season. He can play wide when necessary. He prefers to go out wide to look for space, I prefer to stay central.’ 

Costa looks set to move to Chelsea if Jose Mourinho does not act on his long-standing admiration for Falcao, who believes the magic will remain at Atletico as long as Diego Simeone stays. He was coached first at River Plate and then at Atletico by the manager who Fifa neglected to put in their top 10 coaches last season.

‘I think they forgot him,’ said Falcao. ‘He is one of those coaches who has everything. He knows how to motivate players but it’s a lot more than that. People think it’s all inspiration but there is an awful lot of work done, too. He knows how to analyse the games and he knows where to take advantage of the opposition’s weakness.’

It's been a while since we've seen Colombia. Where have they been?

After success in the 1990s with midfielder Carlos Valderrama and his wonderful hair, Colombia have failed to reach the last three World Cups.

They have a colourful past...

Colombia were highly fancied for the 1994 World Cup but finished bottom of their group afterAndres Escobar’s own goal.

On his return to Colombia, Escobar was shot dead.

How did they qualify this time?

Impressively. Colombia had the best defensive record in their group. They thrashed Uruguay 4-0 and got as high as third in the world rankings.
