When it's a hot, sunny and you are really feeling the heat there is nothing better than a cooling shower.

But this giant panda at Yantai Zoo in eastern China seems to be finding attempts to cool him down a little too bracing.

Keepers at the zoo decided to spray down giant male panda Hua Ao with a hose as temperatures in the town hit 30c.

Hosing off: Hua Ao backs off and raises his paws as keepers give him a cooling soak in his enclosure

But Hua Ao found their attempts a little too direct, raising his paws to block the cool water and backing away.

At one point the giant panda, with its famous black and white fur, lost its footing as it attempted to get out of the firing line.

The gorgeous bear can be seen falling into a barrel roll as it decides staying dry is better than cooling down.

The panda also takes to a wooden platform, peeking out from behind a post to see what's coming his way next.

Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.

They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat.

They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.

The rare bears usually live in cool forests and have thick fur so need help to stop over-heating
