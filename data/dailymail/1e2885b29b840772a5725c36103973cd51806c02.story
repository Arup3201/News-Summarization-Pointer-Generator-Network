Gender stereotypes are not yet a thing of the past as a new survey reveals that many people still have strong opinions on which jobs are suitable for men and women.

Two-fifths of Britons believe there are some jobs which women should never do, including soldier, mechanic and surgeon.

A similar proportion think that men are unable to do some jobs properly, such as beautician, florist and nurse.

The survey of 2,000 British adults carried out by mobile payment service WorldPay Zinc revealed that two-thirds of people think men make better plumbers, mechanics and electricians than women.

Just three per cent think that women are better pilots and surgeons than men, even though there is no evidence for this.

And women are just as likely to stereotype their own sex as men are - only two per cent think they are better at technical jobs than men, with 21 per cent saying men are better.

Conversely, men are assumed to be worse at traditionally 'feminine' jobs such as primary school teaching.

Some 64 per cent of Britons say women are better florists, 76 per cent say women are better nannies, and only three per cent believe that men make better nurses.

Charlotte Keene, 25, from Egham, Surrey, who has been a gas engineer for six years and has now started her own company, Gas Girl, said: 'There has been a lot of gender discrimination in my career so far.

'Training was tough and people assume I won't be as good as a male engineer. I've been so stressed about this at times that I nearly threw the towel in.

'But instead of giving into the stereotypes, I saw a gap in the market - lots of women feel safer letting me into their home than they would a man.

The study was carried out on November 4 by research agency Vision Critical which conducted an online survey of 2,026 British adults from consumer panel Springboard UK.

It found that many people said they would not trust a professional because of their gender, with 19 per cent insisting they would not trust a male nanny, 18 per cent would not trust a male beautician and 16 per cent would not trust a man working as a midwife.

Meanwhile, while five out of six Britons would be happy being treated by a male nurse, 11 per cent would feel uncomfortable and five per cent would demand to be seen by a female nurse instead.

17 per cent of people said they would be annoyed to see a female mechanic working on their car - and two per cent would leave the garage in this situation.

Shockingly, three per cent of Britons said that if they found out that they were about to fly on a plane piloted by a woman, they would refuse to board, get off the plane or make an official complaint.

Geraldine Wilson, managing director of WorldPay Zinc, said: 'We're disappointed to see that their lives may still be blighted by these outdated stereotypes.

'Our service is designed to help businesses of every sector, whether they are run by men or women.

'And while our study suggests there is still a way to go before we are able to achieve equality in the workplace, attitudes are changing for the better.'
