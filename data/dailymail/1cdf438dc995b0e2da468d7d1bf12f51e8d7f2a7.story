We've all taken a few holiday snaps  that we're proud of, but they have never looked anything like this.

These incredible images snapped by Russian photography group AirPano depict some of the world's most iconic cities as round planets.

Using a pioneering method of aerial photography, plus some skillful manipulation in Photoshop - known in the trade as 'stereographic projection' - each location can now be seen at a full 360-degree angle, with jaw-dropping results.

The sweeping panoramas were taken over the space of eight years using helicopters, airplanes, dirigibles, hot air balloons, helium balloons and even  radio-controlled drones to capture the images from staggering heights.

Images of San Francisco, Berlin, Venice and Sydney are among the collection, which show hundreds of miles of landscape in some instances.

Sergey Semenov, the 32-year-old coordinator behind the project, said: 'To make these images, firstly we create aerial spherical panoramas, but this is not an easy task.

'We often photograph from a drone, but we also photograph from helicopters, airplanes, dirigibles, hot air balloons and helium balloons.

'Since the beginning of the project, AirPano team has created panoramas of the most interesting and significant places and cities of the Earth.

'The only problems we have are with permission usually, in some places, like Stonehenge, it's strictly forbidden to fly near the monument.

'We plan to visit many more cities yet, including the likes of Indonesia, Japan and Great Britain in the next three months.'
