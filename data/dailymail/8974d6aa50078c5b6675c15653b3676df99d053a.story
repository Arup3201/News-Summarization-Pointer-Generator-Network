At least two music fans have been killed and 23 injured after a suspected drunken driver fleeing police crashed through barricades at the South By Southwest festival in Austin in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Police in Austin, Texas, say the motor crashed through temporary barricades that were set up for the festival and into the throng of people at around 12.30am killing a man on a bicycle and a woman on a moped.

Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference that the motorist - Rashad Owens, 21, of Killeen - crashed and tried to make a getaway on foot, but a police officer shocked him with a stun gun and took him into custody.

The victims were a woman from Austin 
and a man from the Netherlands, Acevedo said. A man who was on the moped
 is in good condition, he said. No names have been released.

The
 driver, whose name also has not been released, faces two counts of 
capital murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault with a vehicle.

Acevedo said it was an ‘intentional act,’ and that the suspect has been booked and formal charges will be filed this afternoon.

Two
 people were in critical condition Thursday morning with 
life-threatening head injuries and three patients remain in serious 
condition, said Dr. Christopher Ziebell, the emergency department 
director at the University Medical Center-Brackenridge said. He also 
said the driver was treated for minor injuries.

‘The
 most critical patients I have a great deal of concern for,’ Ziebell 
said. ‘We are going to do our best for them, but these are some of the 
worst injuries that we see and not everybody with these kinds of 
injuries is going to survive.’

The
 annual music, film and interactive conference draws tens of thousands 
to Austin each year, and the toll could have been much higher. The 
street had been packed with revelers just minutes earlier, but officials
 had cleared the area to create a fire lane.

‘We
 had a large crowd,’ Acevedo said earlier on Thursday morning. ‘I just 
thank God that a lot of the folks had already been pushed on the 
sidewalk or this could have been a lot worse.’

Austin
 police shut off traffic to about a square mile of downtown for five 
days during the festival, turning normally busy roads into a large 
pedestrian mall to help festival-goers reach dozens of music venues.

Police
 said the incident started when an officer on a drunken-driving patrol 
tried to stop the silver Toyota sedan at a gas station a few blocks 
away. The car took off, weaving between parked cars then driving at high
 speed the wrong way down a one-way street.

The
 driver rammed through police barriers - three wooden pieces held up by 
metal poles - set up on Red River Street on the northeast edge of the 
entertainment district near The Mohawk nightclub, where multiple acts 
were to perform Wednesday night.

The bands X and TEEN had just wrapped up, and rapper Tyler the Creator was scheduled to perform at 1 a.m.

An officer had to jump out of the way of the driver, Acevedo said at Thursday's news conference.

‘We
 will review our procedures always, we always look at that. But 
understand something, when somebody acts intentionally, it's very 
difficult to stop. You have a car here. You have a police officer that 
was forced to jump out of the way,’ he said.

Scott
 Jakota, a musician from Indiana in town to play SXSW, told the Austin 
American-Statesman he was one of the first people hit outside The 
Mohawk. He said the driver ‘gunned’ the car.

‘I was thrown up in the sky,’ Jakota said.

Overlooking
 the street, 28-year-old Ally Hulton from Los Angeles, was on a balcony 
of her friend's apartment when she saw the car driving ‘at full speed’ 
before hitting someone.

‘About 10 bodies went flying,’ Hulton told the newspaper.

The
 festival will continue because of the thousands of visitors in town, 
SXSW managing director Roland Swenson said Thursday morning. A 
spokeswoman for the festival said there would be schedule and venue 
changes.

‘It would cause more problems for people to show up and be turned away than to carry on,’ he said.

A
 crime scene unit was still investigating the crash, and Acevedo said 
earlier on Thursday there were no plans to change safety protocols at 
the festival due to the accident.

‘We
 do these events very well, but you cannot stop a person who rather than
 face drunk driving charges decides to speed at a high rate of speed, go
 around a uniformed officer forcing him to run out of the way, then at a
 high rate of speed show total disregard for the sanctity of human 
life,’ Acevedo said.

Acevedo asked witnesses and those who may have taken video to contact police rather than post it on the internet.

As events were unfolding downtown, two of music's biggest 
stars Kanye West and Jay Z played a two-hour show at the Austin Music 
Hall.

The popular South By Southwest festival, known as 
SXSW, brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to Austin, Texas every 
year. Earlier, Debbie Harry was among those to take to the stage.
