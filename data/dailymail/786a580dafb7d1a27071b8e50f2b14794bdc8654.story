Sydney councils have been accused of going soft on smokers who disobey smoking bans on some of the regions most popular beaches, sparking outrage from environmentalists.

Some local councils have informed rangers patrolling the areas to either not inforce the ban or to not issue a fine for the breach, which could set smokers back between $110 and $200.

Bondi, Manly and Coogee rangers have allegedly been instructed by council to not fine people who flout the ban, and Randwick and Waverly councils also do not enforce the penalty.

Under the NSW Smoke Free Environment Act, many public areas such as playgrounds, pools, and bus stops are smoke free.

However, many Sydney beaches are either smoke 'friendly', or are under the authority of lenient smoke-free laws enforcement.

A cigarette butt collection study revealed that Bondi Beach had more than one million discarded cigarette butts left in the sand, reported The Daily Telegraph.

'This noxious material is blowing all over the place and there is legislation to stop it on the beaches,' said Clean Up Australia head Ian Kiernan. 

Mr Kiernan said local councils needed to be firmer on smoking regulations, but Waverley mayor Sally Betts said that the area used education campaigns and no-smoking signs as deterrents.

Ms Betts said that most locals tended to obey the no-smoking ban, but that the main barrier came from tourists who didn't understand the regulations. 

'There is a ­language barrier and many are used to being able to smoke anywhere they want in their own countries. Our rangers are continually saying to people ‘this is a non-smoking area, please don’t smoke’ and people usually apologise and say ‘we didn’t know’,' said Ms Betts.

Emma Richardson, an English backpacker who had been photographed smoking on the beach, said that she had not seen the no-smoking signs and was not aware of the ruling. 

Randwick council took a hardline approach to the issue when it recently banned smoking on it's beaches, which councillor Katherine Nielson said followed on the no-smoking ban in other public areas such as playgrounds and bus stops.

'It's not just [about] the passive smoking, which is bad for all of us, but the butts are also very difficult for the cleaning mechanism machines to pick up,' Councillor Nielson said.

'We've already got the signs, it's just a matter of adding a [no-smoking] symbol to the signs,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

'We didn’t want to make it a money-making exercise because I think most people, if asked by a lifeguard not to smoke, will ­apologise and put the cigarette out,' she told The Daily Telegraph.
