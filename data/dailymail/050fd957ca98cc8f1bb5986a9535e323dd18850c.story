A father stabbed his wife and children to death in their beds and stayed in the family home with their bodies for days before hanging himself, it was revealed today. 

Jitendra Lad, 49, is believed to have murdered  Daksha Lad, 44, and their daughters, Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, at their detached house in Clayton, Bradford, days after celebrating Diwali as a family.

The motive for the killings remains a mystery and MailOnline understands that police have not yet found a suicide note in the house. 

West Yorkshire Police believe Mr Lad, a 'respectable' council worker and school association chairman, stabbed his family to death as they slept over the weekend.

After several days in the family home alone he hanged himself in one of the empty four bedrooms on Monday.

Investigation: Police forensic teams arrived at the house but they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths

In mourning: Tearful friends of the dead teenagers have for days gathered at the home today to pay their respects 

Hours later a worried neighbour called the police because the Lads had not left the house since Friday, and officers broke in to find the dead bodies. 

Police said last night a post mortem examination performed on Mr confirmed  he died from 'by hanging' and  'the examination suggested Mr Lad died on Monday'.

But the autopsies on his wife and daughters revealed their fatal stab wounds 'are thought to have been sustained at an earlier point during the weekend'. 

To friends and family the Lads were regarded as 'the nicest family in the world' and the father of the family was 'protective' of his 'very clever' daughters and he and his wife were inseparable.

One family member said: 'We had just had a great time of celebration. It had been Diwali and everyone had been happy. It is so sad and we just don't know why this happened or if something was wrong.'  

Friends and neighbours were unaware of any problems in the family and had heard no arguments.

Both parents had good jobs as clerical officers with the local council and were keen to climb the career ladder.

Trisha was in her second year at Leeds University studying for a degree in biochemistry and Nisha was at sixth form.

Forensic officers are still scouring the house as detectives began researching the family for a motive to the horrific murder.

Police said again today they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

The parents and Nisha were seen heading to work and school as normal at around 7.30am on Friday, saying their usual cheerful hello to the newspaper delivery man. However, police said the bodies 'may have been in the property for some time' and neighbours could not recall seeing the family over the weekend.

Mr Lad and his wife married in Bradford 23 years ago. The Hindu couple worked at Bradford Council, Mr Lad in revenue and benefits while his wife was an administrator.

Shop manager Niraj Patel, 49, a friend of Mr Lad, said he was stunned to be told he may have murdered his family. 'He was a very happy, easy-going chap, always a smile on his face,' he said. 'I'm totally shocked. You'd never believe he would have an ounce of violence in him.'

Upset: Neighbours and friends of the family have been visiting the home, with some laying flowers

Tributes: Shocked and emotional Bradford residents arrive at the house to lay flowers in memory of the family

Upset: Neighbours said today there were no clues that a tragedy like this would engulf a 'lovely' family

Susan Hawkins, 34, a support worker, said: 'They were the nicest family in the world and the last family you would ever expect this to happen to. I used to see the mum in the playground when the kids were younger and she had a gorgeous smile, she was a real doting mum.'

Mr Lad's parents were being supported by family at their home less than half a mile from the scene yesterday.

A relative, who did not want to be named, said: 'They are very, very shocked. They don't know what exactly has happened, they are waiting for the police to tell them.'

Neighbours at the family's previous address in Clayton, where they lived for 14 years, said the couple sold up to move to a better area and a better home.

One said: 'You could call them aspirational. She wanted to be head of planning or something like that.'

Jessica Garside, 18, who used to catch the bus to school with the girls, said: 'Trisha was really clever and always had a nice word to say about people.' 

Chris Sampson, the headmaster at Thornton Grammar School, where Nisha Lad and her sister Trisha both studied, said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by these tragic deaths. Our thoughts are with the family's relatives and friends. We will be helping the police with their inquiry in any way we can.' 

Tributes: Leeds University biochemistry student Trisha, 19, left and right, was called the 'one of the sweetest and kindest people' by friends today

The University of Leeds confirmed Trisha was in the second year of a biochemistry degree.

A spokesman said: 'This is dreadful and shocking news and our thoughts are with Trisha's friends and loved ones.

'Staff are working with the University's counselling and chaplaincy services to help students who are affected by this tragedy and we will do all we can to support them.'

Melissa Taylor, president of the Faculty of Biological Sciences Society at the university, said on Twitter: 'Heartbreaking to hear about the death of Trisha Lad, such a lovely, well-liked person. Rest in Peace.'

Steph Mapplebeck said: 'Trisha Lad was one of the sweetest and kindest people I have met whilst studying at Leeds. What a heartbreaking loss. Rest in peace.'
