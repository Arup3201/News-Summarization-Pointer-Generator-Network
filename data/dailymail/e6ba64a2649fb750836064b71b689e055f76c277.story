England's Jazmin Sawyers claimed an unexpected silver medal in the long jump final at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The 20-year-old leaped a personal best 6.54m to land a podium place at Hampden Park. 

She was overjoyed by her final jump - which secured her medal - and she rushed across in joy to celebrate with her coach.

Leap: Sawyers set a new personal best of 6.54m as she jumped to Commonwealth Games silver

Meanwhile, a thigh injury put paid to Shara Proctor's hopes of long jump glory at the Commonwealth Games.

The British record holder was amongst the favourites for gold at Hampden Park, but was unable to top the podium like England team-mate Greg Rutherford managed in the men's event.

Proctor pulled up during her first sprint down the run way, grabbing her left thigh in clear pain - an injury which forced the 25-year-old to withdraw and puts her place at the upcoming European Championships in doubt.
