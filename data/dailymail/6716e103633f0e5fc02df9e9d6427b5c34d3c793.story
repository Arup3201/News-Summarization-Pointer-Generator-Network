A 24-year-old male baby sitter from Florida was arrested in California Friday, eight days after the death of a baby boy who was in his charge.

Joseph Lamay was wanted for questioning in connection to the sudden passing of 4-month-old Lorenzo Hernandez September 26, but police say at this point he is not a suspect.

Lamay, who has an extensive criminal record, was taken into custody on a probation violation. Investigators in Palm Bay, Florida, will determine if the male nanny will face charges in the infant’s death.

Police responded to an apartment complex in Palm Bay at around 1am September 26 after getting a call about a child in distress,ClickOrlando reported. 

Baby Lorenzo was rushed to Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center, where he passed away a short time later.

According to detectives, Lamay was babysitting Lorenzo, his girlfriend Chastity Cintron's son, and was the only person in the infant's presence after the child's biological father tucked him in at around 10.30pm.

Sometime after midnight, Lamay called 911 saying that the baby in his care was not breathing after hitting his head in a fall from a couch, according to WESH-TV.

After the boy's death, Lamay was interviewed by police and let go. He was described as being cooperative at the time.

Police in Florida believe the 24-year-old boarded a bus and made the 2,500-mile cross-country trip to Garden Grove, California, where the local police flagged him down Friday.

WFTV reported that an autopsy will be performed on baby Lorenzo to determine the cause of death, but the child’s family believe he died from a brain hemorrhage.

‘My daughter right now is completely lost, she doesn't know what to think,’ Lorenzo’s grandfather, Frank Cintron, told the station. ‘She tells me that the guy was good to her and kind to her kids but sometimes you don't really know anyone.’

Joseph Lamay has a troubled past, including convictions for heroin possession and domestic violence.

In April 2013, he was arrested in Palm Bay on charges of felony battery and damage to property.
