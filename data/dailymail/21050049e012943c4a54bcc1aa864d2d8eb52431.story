Incredibly deceiving images of what can easily be mistaken for snow-covered Australian mountains  have been released.

But do not be fooled. Instead, what the pictures really show are stunning pyramids of plain, white salt.

These were taken five years ago, when Emma Phillips was on a mission to find the perfect location for her final assignment to wrap up her photography course.

Incredibly deceiving images of what can easily be mistaken for mountains of snow have been released by Melbourne-based photographer Emma Phillips

For the first time, the photographer has published the photos in her book 'Salt' which shows the vastly treeless landscape of the Nullabor Plain

Phillips spent two months in the Nullabor Plain out in the Western Australian desert to find the perfect location for her final assignment for her photographer course five years ago

Her vision was to capture images of an industrial location near the city of Melbourne but this proved to be quite an arduous process.

Instead, she left her hometown and spent two months in the Nullabor Plain out in the Western Australian desert.

There she came across an abandoned salt refinery and found exactly what she was looking for.

Phillips was particularly impressed with the way 'the buildings seemed to disappear and the way the salt shimmered in the sun'

The whole experience was 'desolate, eerie and beautiful', the 25-year-old told Daily Mail Australia
