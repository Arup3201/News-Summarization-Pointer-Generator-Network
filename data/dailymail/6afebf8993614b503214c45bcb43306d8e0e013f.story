A gas station clerk from Arizona has been hailed as a hero for helping rescue a baby girl who police say was kidnapped by her own grandmother.

Carolyn Ferguson, 57, was arrested Wednesday night in a Phoenix suburb for allegedly abducting 6-month-old Laylani Mosley from her parents’ home in Huntington Beach, California.

The baby's disappearance had sparked an Amber Alert, which ultimately helped police track down the infant and her grandmother. According to authorities, the woman has a history of mental illness.

Hero: Gas station cashier Karin Atkins has been credited with helping save baby Laylani by contacting 911 and stalling her grandfather until officers arrived

Police say Carolyn Ferguson snatched Laylani from her crib at around 9am and drove 300 miles to Tonopah, Arizona, where her 2007 PT Cruiser broke down.

The 57-year-old called a tow truck, which dropped her off at Shell gas station where she went to seek help.

Cashier Karin Atkins, who has a 2-year-old boy of her own, immediately suspected that something did not add up about the middle-aged woman cradling an infant in her arms, the station CBS5 reported. 

Atkins noticed that the baby was wearing a diaper too big for her age, and she saw Ferguson filling the child's bottle with cappuccino from the coffee machine mixed with strawberry milk.

When Atkins approached Ms Ferguson, the woman claimed to be Laylani’s mother but could not tell her the girl's date of birth or middle name.

Red flags: Atkins (left) noticed that the child was wearing a too-big diaper, and it seemed odd that the older woman who presented herself as Laylani's mother could not remember her date of birth

Saved: Sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene and whisked the abducted child to a hospital for a check-up

In custody: Ferguson, 57, has been extradited to Calfirnia to face kidnapping charges

Suspecting foul play, Atkins called her supervisor, who looked up online 'Amber Alert baby' and found out that an infant matching Laylani’s description had been kidnapped in California.

'It's a mom thing. If it wasn't her baby, it would kill me if I let her walk out that door and know later on that it wasn't hers and I could've done something at that moment,' Atkins told ABC7.

Atkins immediately called 911 and occupied Ferguson while awaiting officers to arrive. She changed the baby’s diaper and even found some formula for her. 

Unstable: Ferguson's family told police the woman is bipolar, and she has been ranting about the end of the world before the kidnapping

Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies converged on the gas station at around 7pm and arrested Ferguson, who was described as acting disoriented.

Baby Laylani was taken to a hospital where doctors determined that she was in a good condition.

She was reunited with her parents early Thursday morning – more than 12 hours after her mother woke up from a nap and discovered that her daughter was gone. 

This afternoon, Carolyn Ferguson was extradited to California to face charges of child abuse and endangerment. She is being held on $50,000 bond.

Her relatives told police the grandmother was suffering from a bipolar disorder and was off her medication.

In the days before the alleged abduction, Ms Ferguson’s mental state reportedly has taken a turn for the worse, with the woman raving about the end of the world, according to NBC Los Angeles.CBS 5 - KPHO
