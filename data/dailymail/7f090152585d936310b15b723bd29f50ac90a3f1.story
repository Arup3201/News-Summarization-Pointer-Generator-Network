Casey-lee Hull, 17, passed away after her car smashed into a tree at Shellharbour on Friday night

A 17-year-old girl has died after the car she was driving in an alleged drag race smashed into a tree, trapping her inside.

Police are currently investigating whether Casey-lee Hull, from Albion Park in New South Wales, was participating in a drag-race with several other cars on the 50 kilometre per hour sign posted road in Shellharbour on Thursday night when she lost control of her car at about 7.45pm.

'It appears the teenager has lost control of the Suzuki as she tried to negotiate a left hand bend,' a NSW Police spokesperson said.

'The car started to rotate and mounted the western kerb before striking a large tree.'

Tributes have started flowing in for the girl who died in hospital on Friday, in which she has been described as an inspirational person.

'Rest In Peace beautiful girl. We will miss you so much. You always brought so much happiness and positivity with you, wherever you went. You lit up a room like no one else could. So much love,' one person wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to Casey-lee.

So far the page, RIP Casey Lee Hull, has been liked almost 2,500 times since it was created on Friday night.

'Such a beautiful, talented and inspirational young woman! Loved by all those who knew her. She will never be forgotten and remains in everyone's heart. Fly high up in the sky you beautiful angel and may we all remember you for being the amazing and beautiful seventeen year old girl you are xx love you lots,' another heartfelt tribute said.

A 22-year-old man from Warilla believed to have been participating in the race and driving a Ford Falcon XR6, returned to the crash site in an attempt to help her.

At the scene of the crash, emergency workers had to free her from the car after she became trapped in the wreckage

However the teenager was trapped in the wreckage and was not freed until emergency services attended the scene.

She was airlifted to St George Hospital for immediate surgery and was in a critical and unstable condition for some time before she died.

The man has been questioned by police at Lake Illawarra Police Station and was released pending further inquiries.

The girl's black Suzuki Swift has been seized by police and will undergo mechanical inspection.

Investigators are appealing to the public who may have any further information.
