Forget in-flight entertainment!

They turned a moving walkway into a makeshift stage so that everyone could catch a glimpse of them in action.

Footage shows the girls stretching their legs into high kicks and performing body ripples in sync. 

Music is heard booming away in the background.

The female acrobats and tumbling team had been in California for a meet with Azusa Pacific University.

To date, the video of them in action at the airport has garnered more than 300,000 hits on Tumblr.

High-tech: The routine was apparently something one of the girls learned from watching an Instagram video

Jalen Kirkland, one of the dancers, said she has been shocked by the response.

Recalling the chain of events, she told Yahoo News: 'After being told that the plane wasn’t quite ready to take off, the team (and everyone else on the plane) got off the plane and headed back into the airport.

'After 13 hours in the airport, we decided to have some fun, and that’s how that video was made.'

Kirkland says that the routine was something that her teammate Nicole Seybold learned from watching an Instagram video.
