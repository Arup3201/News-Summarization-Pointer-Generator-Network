Child murderer Mark Bridger was spotted driving up a remote country lane on the night April Jones disappeared, it has been revealed.

The former abattoir worker, who has been jailed for the rest of his life for killing the five-year-old, refuses to reveal what he did with her body.

But the sighting could hold the key to where he left her remains, it has been reported.

Hotel owner Gordon Holt, 58, has said he believes he spotted the killer driving up a remote lane towards woodland

Hotel owner Gordon Holt, 58, has told the Daily Mirror he believes he spotted the killer driving up a remote lane towards woodland as he returned home towards Corris, near Machynlleth, at about 11pm that night.

He said: 'When I looked over I identified it as a blue Land Rover, and from what I could see it appeared to be a left-hand drive which I thought was strange.'

Mr Holt said at the time he spotted the car he was not aware April was missing. He found out she had been taken the following morning.

He said: 'But it was not until we heard the description of Bridger's vehicle that I put two and two together that it could have been him.'

Mr Holt said he then told the police about what he had seen.

Dyfed Powys Police has confirmed the sighting was investigated at the time.

Mr Holt said the lane, which winds back to Bridger's cottage, leads to a dense forest with hidden wartime bunkers.

April's parents Coral and Paul Jones last week begged Bridger to reveal what he did with her body.

Bridger's friends have revealed the oddball killer would often camp alone near his home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, with only a crate of super strength lager Special Brew or cider for company.

And they told The Sun that Bridger regularly liked to discuss where he would conceal a body.

'He did know the woods and hills around here very well because he'd spend all his time in the wild,' they said.

Mark Bridger leaves Mold Crown Court after he was given a whole life sentence for the abduction and murder of schoolgirl April Jones

The murderer was described by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court last week as a 'pathological and glib liar' and a 'paedophile who for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls' as he was given a rare whole life sentence.

Justice Griffith-Williams also asked him to reveal what he did with April's body for the sake of her parents.

On October 1 last year Bridger snatched and murdered April, five, on the Bryn-Y-Gog estate, in Machynlleth, Powys, before 'lying through his teeth' by claiming he accidentally hit her with his car and was so drunk he did not know what happened to the body.

But after a five-week trial it took the jury just four hours to decide Bridger was a fantasist, obsessed with child murder and child pornography, who had lured disabled April into his car, before killing her.
