Alan Pardew is considering an emotional return to Crystal Palace as manager.

Newcastle boss Pardew scored the winner for Palace in their 1990 FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool and while it seems incredible that he would walk out on such a big club, he has privately maintained that he wants the chance to manage Palace.

Palace co-chairman Steve Parish is considering Pardew — along with Hull chief Steve Bruce and other British managers — as a replacement for Neil Warnock. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is the £5million compensation fee in Pardew’s contract.

And Pardew did not face the press after his side's 3-2  win over Everton on Sunday, fuelling speculation he could be set for a move.

Bruce is another surprise name on Palace’s list, which also includes Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy and Alan Curbishley.

Bruce’s position has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a poor run of results has left Hull in danger of relegation.

Palace are keen to explore the possibility of a move for Bruce, who was a target in the summer following Tony Pulis’ shock departure.

The Palace hierarchy, who are keen to appoint a British manager with a proven Premier League track record, have huge admiration for the job Bruce has done at Hull and want to find out if luring the former Manchester United defender is a viable option.

There are fears, though, that Bruce’s appointment could spark a backlash from supporters.

Bruce left Selhurst Park in controversial circumstances during the 2001-02 season, when he left to take charge of Birmingham City.

And a section of Palace fans have never forgiven the 53-year-old, targeting Bruce with abuse, particularly when he comes back to Selhurst Park.

There would be similar issues with a move for Curbishley given his links with fierce south London rivals Charlton.

Bruce’s current deal expires in the summer and he is yet to agree an extension, which has cast a further cloud over his reign at Hull.

Fulham tried to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding his future earlier this season, but failed in attempt to lure him to Craven Cottage as they appointed Kit Symons instead.
