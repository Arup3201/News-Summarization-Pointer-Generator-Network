A married father-of-three who was trying to dig around a 6,000lb boulder in his yard became pinned under the rock and died on Monday.

Paul Comeau Jr, 47, had been working on extricating the boulder over several months in his yard in Raymond, New Hampshire, police said. 

He was digging around the rock in an attempt to free it. While he was working on it on Monday, the boulder became dislodged, causing him to be pinned between it and the wall of a ditch.

His wife came home and could not locate him so called his phone and found it in the home which was unusual. She then discovered her husband in the back yard, according to WMUR. 

First responders discovered Comeau was not conscious and was not breathing. 

A tow truck was needed to lift the boulder off him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Comeau leaves behind his wife and three children.
