Georgia Salpa is officially one of the globe's sexiest women being listed in FHM's World's Sexiest Women earlier this year.

The 29-year-old model scooped 25th place and ever since has been keen to show off her bikini body posing for several revealing lingerie shoots.

The Greek-born Irish glamour model, was unveiled as the face and body of Alexis Smith Lingerie in May, replacing TOWIE'S Jessica Wright, modelling a range of the brand's steamy swimwear range and since embarked on several other campaigns with the company.

In her latest shoot Georgia models a luxurious autumnal collection in sumptuous silks in rich jewel colours such as deep purple and ivy. 

Launched in 2010, the Alexis Smith brand caters for women with big busts and small frames, like 30F cup Georgia, who was signed as the new face of the brand in May 2014 . 

Georgia, 28, has the kind of body that most women could only dream of possessing but she sure works hard for it, often posting selfies at the gym or wearing skimpy sports kit.

Georgia, who often uploads snaps of herself wearing skimpy gym wear to Instagram, shot to fame after a stint on Celebrity Big Brother where she was the third housemate evicted.

The 28-year-old model appears in two jewel coloured sets of matching briefs and bras 

As well modelling Georgia has made other several TV appearances on shows such as Celebrity Salon and Catwalk to Kilimanjaro. 

Georgia Salpa has recently been showing some skin for a good cause when she modeled a range of pink lingerie in aid of Breast Cancer Awareness month.

Georgia was photographed in a limited edition set from Alexis Smith underwear created to raise money for the charity Against Breast Cancer during October.

Alexis Smith, the woman behind the lingerie says that she is thrilled to be helping the charity once again. 

'It's great to be working with the Against Breast Cancer charity again. We have worked with them in the past and wanted to support them again this year throughout Breast Cancer Awareness month. 

'25% of all sales from our limited edition pink satin set will be donated to the charity throughout the month of October. I hope that sales of the limited edition pink set will help raise vital funds for the charity that carries out pioneering research at the University of Westminster in London.'
