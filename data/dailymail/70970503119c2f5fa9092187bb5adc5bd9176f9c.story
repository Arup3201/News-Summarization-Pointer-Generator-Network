The story of Bonnie and Clyde has been told so often, most famously in the 1967 film starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty; creating an original story based on the couple is seems almost impossible.

And yet, a new mini-series charting the lives of the gun-toting pair not only breathes new life into their legacy, it also demonstrates that the pair have as much appeal now as they did in their own lifetimes.

As rising British star, Holliday Grainger, who plays Bonnie in the new series, remarks, 'It’s one of those stories that has so many layers of intrigue to it. It’s just endlessly fascinating.'

So who were the famous outlaws? Most agree that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were two gangsters who criss-crossed their way around 30s America, looting banks and embarking on a two-year killing spree that resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people, including seven police officers.

Had they been imprisoned for their crimes their fame might not have spread, but instead they died in a hail of police gunfire – Bonnie was just 23 and Clyde 25 – thus cementing their fame for good.

Countless books, songs and even musicals have immortalised the couple’s crimes, but it’s the Arthur Penn-directed film, which saw both Dunaway and Beatty earn Oscar nominations, that the new series will be compared to.

'Well,' says Grainger, 'I can’t ever live up to Faye Dunaway! But our script seems quite different. We have four hours to tell a story, so we really get to know the characters, their motivations and the reasons for their actions, which stem from their childhoods. It’s just very different.’

The mini-series, which also stars Emile Hirsch as Clyde, is indeed very different – the most notable difference coming from Grainger’s portrayal of Bonnie Parker, dubbed The Cigar-Smoking Gun Moll at the height of the couple’s fame.

While Dunaway exuded a worldly sexuality in her portrayal of Bonnie, 25-year-old Grainger (whose previous roles include Estella in the 2012 film adaptation of Dickens’ Great Expectations) plays her at times with a wide-eyed innocence, which somehow makes Bonnie’s crimes seem even more horrifying. 

During her research for the role, Grainger read Bonnie’s letters and diaries and admits that, ‘While in the script she’s sassy and confident, in her diary she comes across as a lost little girl who just needed to be loved.

Memorable: According to Granger, Bonnie and Clyde continue to fascinate

As a child she would cry for her mother whenever the pair were separated, and even when she married at 15 – to small-time criminal Roy Thornton – her mother ended up moving in with them.

'She was terrified of thunderstorms and didn’t like insects, so I liked the idea of this little girl who needed love and recognition. That was why she sought fame so much.’

The latest version tells the tale as a contemporary fable about Bonnie’s desire for recognition. In one scene she reads a newspaper account of one of the couple’s heists and frets endlessly about the unflattering photo of her, rather than about the shopkeeper they’ve just killed in cold blood.

‘Bonnie’s almost like a reality TV star in the way she wanted to be up there on the screen,’ says Grainger.

‘The real Bonnie was an aspiring actress but never made it. Back then in cinemas they used to show newsreels of Chicago gangsters before they played the movies.

'That was the reality TV of the time, and for Bonnie the next best thing to being a glamorous actress was a life of crime. Today it would be Big Brother.’

Born in Texas in 1910, Bonnie Parker was just four when her father died and her mother Emma, played by Holly Hunter, raised her and her two siblings alone.

But if her upbringing was poor, Clyde Barrow’s was even bleaker. Living in the slums of Dallas, Clyde began his life as a petty criminal, stealing turkeys before progressing to holding up stores.

By the time he met Bonnie at a party in 1930, he had already had great experience of a life outside the law, yet because he had nice clothes ‘and fancy cars’ as she told friends later, she wasn’t too concerned with his criminal tendencies.

As she wrote in her diary, she wasn’t ‘going to sit back and let the world sweep by’. The couple fell in love, in spite of her marriage, but within months Clyde was in jail.

When he got out he resolved never again to go back to prison and hit the road, taking Bonnie with him.

Over the next two years the couple rampaged their way across America’s south-central states as part of the Barrow Gang – a group which also included Clyde’s older brother Buck and Buck’s wife Blanche – and the public became increasingly enthralled by their exploits.

When a roll of camera film was discovered by police in one of the couple’s abandoned hideouts, it featured a shot of Bonnie smoking a cigar, a gun nestling against her hip – the 30s version of the ‘selfie’.

The image scandalised and titillated the public in equal measure, and saw Bonnie feature not only on the covers of true-crime magazines, but also more glamorous publications. The fame she’d craved was hers at last.

Their spree ended when Clyde and Henry Methvin, another member of the Barrow Gang, murdered two highway patrolmen in Southlake, Texas on 1 April 1934.

Even though Methvin later admitted the killings, his father alerted police to the whereabouts of Bonnie and Clyde in exchange for leniency towards his son.

The couple were lured onto a deserted road outside Gibsland, Louisiana, and on 23 May 1934, they came to a bloody end after being ambushed by six officers. They were shot more than 50 times without firing a round in return.

Some may criticise the continued glamourisation of the pair, but, says Grainger, 'Bonnie and Clyde were glamourising crime themselves – Bonnie would be on the run with her furs and heels.

'But the ending is such an intensely gruesome and definite ending that it diminishes any glamour.'

She adds: 'Bonnie was incredibly single-minded in her need for recognition and she trampled on everyone to get that. But there’s a lot of vulnerability to her as well, so the juxtaposing of those two elements was interesting.

'The tale of Bonnie and Clyde has a Romeo and Juliet love story, it’s got rebellion, it’s got everything. It’s a story that people never seem to tire of watching.’
