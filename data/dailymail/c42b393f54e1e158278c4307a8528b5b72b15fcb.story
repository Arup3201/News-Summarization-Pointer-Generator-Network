A former U.S. Secret Service agent has launched a stinging attack on the Clinton administration staff he used to protect - branding them arrogant and claiming that ex-First Lady Hillary Clinton was aloof.

Breaking from tradition, Dan Emmett has laid bare a series of anecdotes about the inner workings of the White House in a controversial book.

He tells how Mrs Clinton, now Secretary of State, never said 'thank you' to agents, unlike her husband, Bill, and their daughter, Chelsea.

Aloof: Hillary Clinton (pictured in 2008) would never say 'thank you' to the Secret Service agents who protected her during her husband's presidency, according to a former member of the protection unit

Ungrateful: Her demeanor was colder than that of Mr Clinton and their daughter Chelsea (centre)

This trait, he added, was found in 
even greater measure among the young White House personnel, whom he said
displayed 'fundamental traits of rudeness and arrogance' which, at 
times, bordered on dangerous.

'Most
of these youngsters were from wealthy families and many viewed Secret 
Service agents as the hired help,' he wrote in the autobiography Within
Arm's Length.

One unnamed Clinton employee treated a Russian KGB agent on one 
presidential visit 'as if he were dealing with a Wackenhut security 
officer in Toledo.'

He also 
accuses Mr Clinton of putting his own life and those of his agents at risk by insisting on a 'totally pointless photo op' on the North 
Korea-South Korea border.

During the trip in 1993, he said the 
former President went too far along the bridge separating the two 
nations, according to the Washington Examiner.

'No-one seemed to know if President Clinton grasped how potentially dangerous this stop on the bridge was,' he writes.

'The Secret Service obviously believed this move unwise'

He added: 'Nevertheless, he was POTUS and he wanted to stand on the bridge, so stand on the bridge he would do.'

In another account, Emmett said Mr Clinton 'dealt us this nightmare' by insisting on jogging in public.

Agents tried to change his mind and even went as far as building a quarter-mile track inside the White House confines.

But
Mr Clinton was unpersuaded and asked the presidential protective division
to come up some routes outside the grounds, it was reported on Chicago 
Tribune News.

'The worst 
thing for the Secret Service is to take a sitting president into public 
when no one has been swept and anyone could be out there,' he said.

Emmett,
who also served under George H.W. Bush and now works as a teacher, has 
been criticised by the service for publishing his tell-all.

Secret
Service spokesman Ed Donovan told the Washington Examiner: 'It causes 
concern because we donâ€™t want to erode the trust that we have with our 
protectees.'
