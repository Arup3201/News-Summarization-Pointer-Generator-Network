It was in a radio interview in November when Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, tired of managers pushing their players under his nose saying he should ‘call up this one’ or ‘take a look at that one’, said: ‘Why does no-one ever ask me about Adrian the West Ham goalkeeper?’

A slightly surprised silence among studio presenters gave way to a consensus that amounted to: good question, why does no one ever talk about Adrian? Two months later and more people are talking about the West Ham goalkeeper than ever before.

Jose Mourinho, not prone to agreeing with Del Bosque, said after Adrian’s performance against his team on Boxing Day: ‘He was marvellous, just as he was marvellous last season’.

Spain stays glued to the Premier League during La Liga’s winter break and Adrian’s performances only enhanced his chances of becoming No 3 behind Iker Casillas and David de Gea when the next squad is announced in March.

‘I heard what Del Bosque said and it’s honour,’ he says at West Ham’s training ground. ‘It’s not just that he spoke about me but that he was the one who brought my name up. No-one asked him.’

Another famous Spain No 3, Pepe Reina, is one of the major reasons why a 28-year-old from Seville is now plying his trade in east London. ‘I know Pepe very well and I spoke with him before I signed for West Ham,’ Adrian says.

‘He told me: “Do it, don’t hesitate. The Premier League is a great opportunity and you’ll enjoy it hugely just as I enjoyed those years at Liverpool”.’

He doesn’t regret taking the advice. ‘It wins you over more with every game. There is never a match when it seems one of the two teams believe they can’t win. There are times in Spain when you have a team playing one of the big sides and because they have so much respect for them the attitude is “let’s defend and not lose by too many”. Here everyone goes for it. Everyone is brave.’

Not that switching from Spain to the Premier League was easy. As with De Gea, there were adjustments for Adrian to make.

‘The play is a lot more physical here, there are a lot more high balls into the area and the refereeing is different,’ he says. ‘In Spain the slightest push on the keeper, especially if he goes down, the referee will blow. You have to watch the flight of the ball and dodge the challenges.

‘That’s the biggest difference but I have adapted well. I was good in the air in Spain and I’m big enough to cope so that has helped.’

There were other adjustments to make. Spanish goalkeepers are more prone to punch than catch and tend to be more comfortable using their feet. You can’t imagine Sam Allardyce favours a punching playmaker between the posts.

‘It’s true that here they don’t like you to punch,’ Adrian says, ‘but sometimes when the area is crowded and you try to catch you can get a nudge from someone, the ball gets away, and if they don’t blow for a foul it’s a goal. Sometimes a good punch will clear the ball very effectively so you have to mix it up. With passing the ball out from the back you can’t be taking unnecessary risks, but if you are decisive then there shouldn’t be a problem.’

Adrian was a late starter, not taking up the gloves until he was 11 and not breaking into the Real Betis first team until 25.

‘I was an outfield player before I was a goalkeeper,’ he says. ‘I played up front until I was 10 and I loved to score goals but when my Under 11 team CD Altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked: “Who wants to go in goal?”

‘I said I didn’t mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on I’m still in goal!’

Since making his Premier League debut, no goalkeeper has made more saves than West Ham's Adrian

Adrian was called 'marvellous' by Jose Mourinho after his recent performance at Stamford Bridge

He stayed at Betis for 16 years but had to wait for Pepe Mel’s arrival to graduate to first choice in 2012.

‘An obstacle always seemed to crop up. Three years ago I tore my cruciate and the following year I started as third keeper but the first keeper wasn’t playing well and the second keeper had problems after saying something in an interview that the manager didn’t like so my chance came and I took it.’

He’s bright too, picking up the language despite starting from zero. ‘You have to launch yourself into it without worrying about sounding like a fool. You need basic phrases immediately. You can’t be thinking how do I say ‘away’ or ‘man-on’ when you are in the middle of the game.

‘I have my own English teacher because my girlfriend speaks excellent English. Deciphering accents can be the biggest problem and there are plenty in the dressing room.’

There are also plenty of Spanish speakers at the club, though Big Sam is not one of them. ‘I think he knows “tapas” and “cerveza”,’ says Adrian. ‘But the coaching staff are taking Spanish and French classes.’

Adrian’s family knew all about West Ham from Diego Tristan, a former Betis youth player who played for the club. And Adrian adds: ‘They also signed Manuel Almunia. I was only a kid but when Spanish players come abroad — especially a goalkeeper — you notice which club he has signed for.’

Adrian was aware that former Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia had played for the Hammers before him

His references also go back to the club’s finest keeper. ‘Don’t worry, I also know who Phil Parkes is! I know he is a legendary keeper for this club and everyone loves him.’

Parkes was in goal the last time West Ham won something, lifting the FA Cup in 1980. Adrian believes the team is moving in the right direction after a good summer in the transfer market.

‘There is a change of style,’ he says. ‘The signings have brought a lot more variety and more options, and now the manager can make decisions and think “how do we approach this game?” We now we have plan A, B or C.

‘You can really build from midfield when you have a player like Alex Song who will always show for the ball and move it on. That helps the team to build from the back and not always play the long ball.’

The one thing Adrian oozes is enthusiasm for the game.

He doesn’t overplay it, but having seen two young team-mates lose their lives — Miki Roque and Dylan Tombides both to cancer aged 23 and 20 — it can only have made him more aware of the speed at which not just a career but also life itself can pass a player by.

Adrian said the Premier League has grown on him and he thoroughly enjoys life in the competition

‘I had played with Miki from the youth team,’ he says. ‘We were very close friends because we had come through the youth system together. You never imagine it can happen to a team-mate. Everyone has to die some time, but not someone like Miki who was so young and in the best moment of his life.

‘We have to make the most of life and make the most of times when things are going well. When these tragic things happen you are reminded of what life is about — enjoying being alive.’

He does that mantra justice with his goal celebrations that have endeared him to West Ham fans. ‘You can feel a bit isolated in goal so when the team scores I love to celebrate,’ he says. ‘I can’t go running to the other end of the pitch so I celebrate with the supporters.’

A festive dip in results and the failure to win at Everton in midweek have pegged back expectations. But Adrian still feels West Ham are moving forward.

‘Maybe last season we would always hit teams in the same area so in the end they put a wall there. Now we can vary the approach to get around that. We can really compete.’

As long as Adrian’s wall holds firm at the other end, they will have a chance.
