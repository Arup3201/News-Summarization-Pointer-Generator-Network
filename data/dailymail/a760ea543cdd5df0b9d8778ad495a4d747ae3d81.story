An overzealous fan who accidentally smacked Andy Murray in the eye with a programme was today identified as an autograph-hunter who set up a business selling mementoes on eBay.

Ifran Ahmed struck the Wimbledon champion during a scrum for his signature as he left an upmarket restaurant in Mayfair last night.

The World No. 2 was being ushered through the crowd of well-wishers when a brochure bearing the words 'winning serve' was waved near his face.

However, in his desperate bid to get the 26-year-old's attention, Mr Ahmed misjudged the angle and caught him straight in the face.

Mr Ahmed set up a business selling autographs and memorabilia from an account called 'pieceoffame' on eBay in 2002.

Among the items currently listed on the site is a Formula 1 helmet signed by various drivers including champions Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton on sale for £5,000.

Others include a guitar signed by 
Rolling Stones star Keith Richards for £750 and a giant tennis ball 
signed by Murray and Wimbledon finalist Novak Djokovic on offer for £500.

However, it is understood that Mr Ahmed no longer runs the business himself or makes money from the items placed on the account.

Mr Ahmed has also posted pictures on his Twitter account posing with stars such as Olympic diving star Tom Daley, Tour de France winner and London 2012 gold medallist Bradley Wiggins and wrestling icon Hulk Hogan.

On his TwitPic profile, he says: 'My business is selling autographs and memorabilia!!! I also obtain autographs. So I am gonna share my experiences with you of meeting these guys!'

Ouch! The 26-year-old was celebrating after becoming the first British men's winner of Wimbledon in 77 years 

Murray had just enjoyed a quiet dinner with girlfriend Kim Sears at Nobu Berkley ST restaurant when he smacked in the eye as he left for 
home.

He screwed up his face before covering his eyes with his hands and climbing into a waiting car.

Dressed
in a navy suit and blue shirt, the double Grand Slam champion had just 
finished dinner with his girlfriend of seven years, who wore an 
embellished black dress and oversized clutch.

The
pair were joined for dinner by Murray's 
mother Judy, who all left together before he was hit in the face.

It was an unceremonious end to a day 
filled with celebratory interviews for the Scot that included a trip to 
meet children at a tennis court in Lambeth, south London.

The day of media commitments - after just two hours sleep - culminated 
with a trip to Downing Street where he was greeted by David Cameron, Ed 
Miliband and Nick Clegg.

Asked how he managed to keep going after such an exhausting fortnight, the 26-year-old replied: ‘Adrenaline.’

Murray successfully dodged questions about whether he is planning to propose to his long-term girlfriend.

This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby asked if 'popping the question' could be among his list of upcoming challenges.

But Murray replied with a smile: ‘I only met you like ten minutes ago so I wouldn’t be telling you first.'

Just a day after the historic victory, Murray later revealed he is already looking forward to stepping onto Centre Court next year as defending Wimbledon champion.

He said: 'I just cannot imagine what that experience will be like.

'There will be a lot of pressure and nerves but I don't think it can be as bad as it has the last few years.'

He suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Andy Murray in the Wimbledon men's final on Sunday afternoon.

But Novak Djokovic seemed to have put his loss behind him as he hosted a star-studded gala dinner in aid of his Novak Djokovic Foundation on Monday night.

And the 26-year-old tennis star's stunning girlfriend Jelena Ristic proved he is still very much her champion as she proudly posed alongside her man on the green carpet at London's Roundhouse venue.

Proving she is every inch the doting 
girlfriend, Jelena worked the star-studded crowd like a true 
professional, chatting to stars from the worlds of showbiz and sport 
with ease.

And the event certainly pulled in a 
stellar crowd, with the likes of Hollywood actress Kate Hudson, 
supermodel Naomi Campbell, actor Gerard Butler and retired tennis 
champion Boris Becker turning out to do their bit for the charity.

The inaugural foundation dinner was 
even given the royal seal of approval with Sarah Ferguson and her 
daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie also putting in an 
appearance.

The Serbian sportsman looked every 
inch the dapper gentleman as he arrived at the gala dinner, wearing an 
immaculately tailored black suit, which he teamed with a crisp white 
shirt and bow-tie.

But Jelena was the one who truly 
commanded attention on the green carpet, opting for an eye-catching navy
and white strapless gown, featuring a nipped-in waist and full skirt.

The swimwear model wore her honey 
blonde locks swept up off her shoulders into a stylish up-do, and 
accessorised with glittering diamond drop earrings and a navy clutch 
bag.
