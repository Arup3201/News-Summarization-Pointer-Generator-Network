A teenager was terrorised for five years by his own 'evil' mother who locked him up and treated him 'like a dog' after she met a gypsy fortune teller, a court has heard.

Andrew Clappison, 18, told a jury how his mother Linda Clappison, 46, prevented him from going to school - forcing him to work for gypsies on market stalls instead.

The teenager told Hull Crown Court how she had been a caring mother-of-four until his father left the family home when he was 10-years-old.

The jury heard his mother's behaviour then started to change and she subjected him to abuse over the next five years until he was 16.

He said his mother started routinely locking him in his room straight after school - forcing him to eat his dinner in the dark without a light bulb and no heating.

Clappison allegedly made him work for travellers on a market stall in Whitby or at Hull Fair instead of going to school.

Her son claimed he would have to work from midday to midnight unpaid and his mother would punish him if the gypsies complained about him.

The jury was told his mother punched, slapped and kicked him. The teen added that his mother had once hit him with a leather belt and on another occasion banged his head against the wall.

The court heard the young boy's worst punishment was being given a cold bath with his mother holding him under the water.

Andrew Clappison, 18, told a jury at Hull Crown Court that he was 'scared' of his 'evil' mother who he alleges stopped him going from school and forced him to work on a gypsy market stall

He told a jury: 'I was locked up in my bedroom every time I was at home. I was not able to walk the house.

'I was scared of her. I had to have my tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs.

'When
I wanted to go to the toilet, I had to ask by knocking on the door and 
asking to leave. It was the same if I wanted a drink of water. I was 
treated like a dog basically.

'The cold bath was the worst. It was a bad punishment and she knew it was. She is an evil person.'

Mr
Clappison said in January 2010 his mother removed his bed and blankets
from his bedroom making him sleep dressed only in underpants and he got
frost bite.

He claimed she then removed the mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm underneath it.

Mr
Clappison told the court: 'I was sleeping in the cold all the time. 
The boiler was working because it was in my room but I had no radiator.

'I used to wake up with blue feet I was that sick. My feet got frost bite.'

He
was treated for frost bite in all of his toes on his left foot and his 
big toe on his right foot at

Crown
barrister Mark McKone said Andrew Clappison’s attendance at school fell
to just 43 per cent during the period of abuse between the age of 10 and 16.

He said 
despite requests for her to attend school Mrs Clappison never answered 
the phone and Andrew Clappison never went on school trips.

Clappison of Keyingham Marsh, Keyingham, denies two counts of assault, neglect and abandonment of a child.

The trial continues.
