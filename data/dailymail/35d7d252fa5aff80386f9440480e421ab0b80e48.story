Angelina Romero-Alvarez, 50, was shot dead in a parking lot outside her home in Houston, on December 5

A grandmother who was gunned down for her purse by two men in a random attack did not even have any money to steal.

Angelina Romero-Alvarez, 50, was found dead in a parking lot outside her home in Houston, on December 5, by a neighbor.

Now, investigators believe the men responsible for her murder may also be involved in nine other robberies on the city's south side in the past month. 

Mrs Romero-Alvarez had been about to enter her car outside the Wilcox apartment complex in the 2400 block of South Loop West near Kirby at around 7am when her purse was taken and her attackers then shot her dead. 

But her family that she was murdered for no reason - as she had no money on her when she was killed.  

Her son Jose Gonzalez said the death has not only damaged his family, but also the community, Click2Houston reported.

He said: 'My mom was a great woman, a hard-working person.'

Sergeant Warren Meeler, of Houston Police Department, added: 'This senseless act by this cowardly individual is horrible, and we want justice for her family.
