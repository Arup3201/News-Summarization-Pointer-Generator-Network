The eighth green at the Matterhorn Golf Club in Taesch, Switzerland, is known for its hazards.

But golfers will need more than a nifty trick shot to find the hole now, after a giant boulder landed right on top of it.

The two-metre-tall rock tumbled down a mountain and onto the course on Saturday during a heavy thunderstorm, planting itself squarely on the green.

It was among a handful of large rocks and pebblesÂ  that fell on the course from about 1,000 feet up a nearby mountain in the heart of the Swiss Alps.

It is the first time such a rock fall has occurred in the town of Taesch for 200 years.

Fortunately nobody was hurt, other 
than perhaps a few scorecards, and today plans were already being laid 
to destroy the unwelcome intruder.

But
it is unclear what course officials plan to do with the giant crater 
left in its wake. Locals say the easiest solution would be to just fill 
it with sand to make another bunker.

Not the right hole: A huge crater not lies where the rock landed on the fairway and bounced across the course
