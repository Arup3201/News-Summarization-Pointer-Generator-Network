At least 50 people were injured when two trains crashed into each other in Switzerland today  - with a passenger claiming one had jumped a red light.

The crash happened in Rafz, north of Zurich, during the early morning rush-hour.

A high-speed train from Zurich collided with an RER suburban one, causing it to derail.

'The accident happened at 6.45am,' said a Zurich police spokesman. 'It's serious.'

Ambulances and a helicopter rushed to the crash site, as all services on the line between Bulach and Schaffhausen were suspended.

An 18-year-old passenger on the RER train told local media that he thought his train, which had just left Ratz in the direction of Schaffhausen had 'passed through a red light'.

He added: 'A fast train from Zurich came up behind us and brushed against the side of our RER. 

'The Intercity service derailed.' 

Lars Fehr, 20, meanwhile told the Blick daily he had been sitting in the Rafz station waiting room when the crash occurred.

'Suddenly there was a loud bang,' he told the paper, adding that both the trains had been heading in the same direction. 

Fehr said a woman had called the police and some people had headed out to the derailed train to help.

'The conductor got out of the locomotive, put on a safety vest and helped passengers out of the train,' he said.

The Swiss are Europe's top rail users, and their network is normally envied abroad for safety and quality.
