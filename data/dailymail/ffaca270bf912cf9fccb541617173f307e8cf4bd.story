A man who has been the Kansas City Chiefs' mascot for more than two decades was in stable condition after being seriously injured this weekend while rehearsing a zip line routine at Arrowhead Stadium.

Dan Meers, of Missouri, who is married with three children, was injured due to apparent human error, his attorney said today.

The 46-year-old, who has played the KC Wolf since the mascot's inception in 1989, was seriously injured Saturday while practicing for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers in Kansas City, Mo.

No description of Meers' specific injuries was available, but a longtime friend said Meers suffered a serious back injury.

'The injuries appear to be related to the manner in which a third-party company secured the riggings,' his attorney, Tim Dollar, said. 'However, an investigation is pending.'

Kansas City Chiefs spokesman Ted Crews acknowledged Meers' injury on Monday but declined to give details about the accident or his condition.

While Meers doesn't perform the zip line routine every game, Dollar said, he was scheduled to do a slight variation of an entrance he'd done earlier this season.

Being the mascot is a full-time job that involves making community appearances on a daily basis, Dollar said.

Meers is part of a close-knit church community that's helping the family, Dollar said.

'They recognize the need to preserve evidence so that it can be investigated and prevent this thing from happening again,' Dollar said.

'Therefore it was necessary to hire counsel to take over that role while they attend to Dan.'

Meers is listed as an executive committee member of the Newark, Del.-based Mascot Hall of Fame. According to its website, Meers previously performed as Fredbird, the St. Louis Cardinals' mascot, and the University of Missouri's mascot Truman the Tiger.

'Dan is one of the greatest guys on the Earth,' said Rod Handley, a Lee's Summit minister who has known Meers for 24 years. 'He has a beaming smile always on his face. He's one unbelievable guy.'

Handley said Meers is a board member for Handley's ministry, Character That Counts.

About 25 friends and church members were at the hospital Sunday when Meers had back surgery, Handley said.

'These are not minor injuries,' Handley said. 'This is very serious.'
