A nurse has recalled the astonishing moment she unzipped a body bag and found the woman inside - apparently killed by a tornado that flattened her home - was still alive.

She recounted the story exactly a year after storms ravaged the South, flattening homes and killing residents - many of whom ended up in body bags in a make-shift morgue in a Trenton, Georgia.

Dana Culpepper was working at the Dade Health and Rehabilitation Center in Trenton when one room was closed off for the dead bodies.

Saved: Glynis Lawson, left, was caught in a tornado that ripped off her nose and ear. Paramedics thought she was dead and put her in a body bag, but Dana Culpepper, right, heard her moans and found her alive

Dana carried out her rounds amid the chaos - and was certain she heard a moan as she neared the morgue at the end of the building.

'I kept hearing something moan, but I really couldn’t tell 
because there was so much noise,' she told My Fox Atlanta.

With another nurse, she started towards a door where the bodies were being stored. She added: 'We heard another moan and that’s when I 
said, 'Let’s look in the body bag".'

Unzipping the bag, they were stunned to discover Glynis Lawson, barely alive but still breathing.

Friends: Glynis was saved by Dana's quick thinking and multiple surgeries. They see each other every week

Culpepper added: 'When we opened it up, I know half of her nose was gone. Her ear was off and just a lot of blood.'

Unperturbed by the gruesome sight, they immediately got to work and started an IV drip to try to stop the bleeding. 'We just did what comes natural,' she said.

Speaking to Channel 3, Lawson said: 'I'm just glad that they were there that night and heard me.'

She recounted hiding in her closet as the severe weather began to batter her home. 'By the time that it had got to my area,
it was too late for me to go anywhere,' Lawson said.

'Just as I shut the [closet] door, 
that's when everything started - the hitting, the roar, and the house 
started breaking apart.'

She was found in a ditch under the debris of her home and taken to the center where she was later found alive.

Ruins: The tornadoes in April 2011 hit the South, the Midwest and the Northeast. A Tuscaloosa, Alabama street shows the aftermath of the 300 tornadoes that hit the area, leaving 238 in the state dead

Wiped out: In total, more than 300 people were killed by the tornadoes. In Georgia, 14 people lost their lives

Debris: A scene from Trenton, Georgia. Glynis was sheltering in her home when the tornado tore it apart

The storm completely flattened the house. She has now rebuilt it and undergone surgeries to heal.

'I really didn’t think that she would live, to even to make it to the hospital. None of us did,' Culpepper told Fox. 'It’s a miracle. I look at her and I think she’s a miracle.'

Lawson returns to the centre every week to visit Culpepper and the other staff who saved her.

She said she believes she was kept alive to take care of her father, who was suffering from dementia. 'I guess that was God's way of keeping me here, to make sure daddy was okay,' Lawson said.

The tornadoes between 25 and 28 April last year swept across the South, Midwest and Northeast, claiming more than 300 lives. Fourteen died in Georgia, while Alabama lost a staggering 238 people.
