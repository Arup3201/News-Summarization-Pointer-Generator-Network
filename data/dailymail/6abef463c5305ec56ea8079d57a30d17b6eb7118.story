Soldiers struggling to cope with the horrors of war are behind a shocking toll of violence back in Britain, a report has found.

One in eight service personnel has attacked someone in a rage after returning from the battlefield. Wives and partners are often the victims.

Academics confirmed a strong link between psychological trauma and aggressive behaviour at home.

One in eight soldiers has attacked someone after coming home, a new study has found

The findings are especially worrying because British forces have seen a decade of intense conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Thirteen thousand troops were 
questioned for the study, which was  led by Deirdre MacManus of the 
King’s Centre for Military Health Research in London.

Nearly 13 per cent admitted being 
violent in the weeks following their return from a war zone. The figures
were twice as high for combat troops.

And those who experienced multiple 
traumatic events on the battlefield – including handling bodies, aiding 
the wounded and seeing comrades maimed or killed – were four times more 
likely to lash out violently.

‘Army personnel returning home often 
find it difficult to adapt to civilian life after deployment,’ said Dr 
MacManus.

‘Violence was more common among those who showed aggressive 
tendencies before joining the Army, but even when we took that into 
account, there was still a strong link between exposure to combat and 
traumatic events during deployment and violence on return home.'

Earlier this month Aaron Wilkinson, 
24, was jailed for shooting dead his landlady Judith Garnett, 52, at her
farm in Leeds just weeks after serving in Afghanistan with the 
Territorial Army.

The killer, who was convicted of manslaughter, had 
been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder but was not monitored
or treated.

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the 
Army, said: ‘The whole issue of psychiatric injury, which in its extreme
form expresses itself in PTSD, is going to be expressed in domestic 
violence,’ he added. ‘The scale needs to be quantified and more action 
needs to be taken.’

Retired colonel Tony Gauvain, a 
qualified psychotherapist and chairman of the charity PTSD Resolution, 
said soldiers were conditioned to live in a state of hyper-vigilance and
heightened awareness to cope with the dangers of battle.

‘When they get home they are still on this wavelength,’ he said.

Col Gauvain added: 'Many find for days, weeks, months and years that their families and people around them don't understand what they have been through.

'There is an immediate communication gap and this becomes a catalyst for temper and anger.'

Dr Walter Busuttil, director of medical services at Combat Stress, said: 'We aren't surprised by these findings. Studies from abroad have found instances of violent behaviour in returning troops.

'We know from veterans that anger management issues can ruin their lives. Veterans and their families need to make sure they seek help as soon as possible - not years down the line or after their relationships have suffered irreparable damage.'

The Ministry of Defence said it was putting in place measures to improve mental health support for soldiers.

Members of each unit are trained in trauma risk management enabling them to recognise signs of stress in their comrades.

Anyone identified as being at risk is interviewed to check how they are coping with their problems.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are determined to make the mental health services our armed forces receive the best in the world.’
