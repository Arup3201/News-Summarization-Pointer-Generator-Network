Owen Farrell starts his first game in more than a month on Friday as the Saracens and England fly-half attempts to prove his fitness ahead of the autumn internationals.

The 23-year-old was  named by Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall on Wednesday for the tough European Champions Cup clash with Munster in Limerick as they look to build on last week's opening Pool One victory over French giants Clermont at Allianz Park.

England coach Stuart Lancaster has indicated that — fitness permitting — Farrell will be his starting fly-half against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8, but any recurrence of the quad injury which has seen him play just four minutes in the past month would be a major setback.

Lancaster insists he is unconcerned about Farrell's lack of game time.

He said: 'I trust Owen, he'll be ready. We've never been afraid to put players in for the first game, but you have to get the balance right when you're playing the All Blacks. Cohesion and experience is important to us and, of the fly-halves we have, Owen is our most experienced.'

Victory in Limerick would put last season's beaten finalists in pole position to qualify from the group and McCall has named a powerful-looking side which includes second row George Kruis, who was also named by Lancaster in his 33-man squad.

Kruis has impressed this season and got his first England call up following injuries to Leicester locks Geoff Parling and Ed Slater.

'I've been pretty lucky with the opportunity,' Kruis said. 'Other guys who were well in the mix have been injured, but I've got the chance and I have to take it.'

Out-of-favour wing Chris Ashton, who scored two tries against Clermont last week and has been in prolific form this season, starts on the right wing with David Strettle on the left. Both men have a point to prove after being overlooked by England.

McCall said: 'Both wingers have been outstanding for us over an extended period of time.'

Alex Goode, Billy Vunipola and Brad Barritt also start for the north London outfit in their final club game before England take on the world champions.

McCall added: 'History suggests Munster are particularly good at lifting their performance for these home games in Europe. We have to be ready for that and be prepared to match it.'
