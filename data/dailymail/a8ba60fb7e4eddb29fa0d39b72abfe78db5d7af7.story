When he was admitted to hospital following a fall at his home, old soldier Ken Perkin expected to be treated with dignity.

Instead, the 86-year-old was left bristling with anger by staff.

For not only did a nurse forcibly shave off his moustache – a fixture for nearly 70 years – they then told him he was ‘lucky’ to be receiving care at all.

Complaint: Nurses at Kingston Hospital forcibly shaved off Ken Perkin's moustache

The former Grenadier Guardsman claims the nurse pointed at his moustache and said, ‘We’ll have that off while we’re doing it’.

He replied: ‘No you’re not, I’ve had 
that since the war and I want to keep it.’ But the nurse went ahead, 
saying: ‘We’ll make you look about 17 again.’

His son Ian was furious to see that 
the widower’s moustache had been shaved off, leaving his face red raw,  
when he visited him in Kingston Hospital, South-west London, on April 3.

He raised his concerns with the ward matron, but claims his father was then threatened.

‘My father told me a nurse said, “You are lucky we are still caring for you after your son complained about us”,’ he said.

‘He was shocked and distressed. I’ve never seen him without a moustache until that point.

‘You hear the Health Secretary 
saying it is important elderly patients are treated with dignity and 
respect. Well that definitely is not the case at Kingston. If I did that
to somebody, I’d probably get six months in jail.’

The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has highlighted the poor treatment of pensioners in the health service.

Mr Perkin, who has now begun to 
regrow the moustache that he has worn with pride since he was called up 
aged 18 in 1944, was admitted to hospital in February.

He had injured himself in a fall in the annexe where he lives at his son’s house in Worcester Park, south-west London.

He was taken first to St George’s 
Hospital in Tooting, south-west London, before being transferred to 
Kingston two weeks later. He was meant to be moved to nearby Tolworth 
Hospital but spent five weeks in Kingston because of hospital infections
he acquired there.

Mr Perkin, who after the war was a 
sergeant major in the Army Reserves and whose late wife Iris worked at 
the secret code-breaking base at Bletchley Park, was finally discharged 
on Monday.

Care: Kingston hospital have said that they will look into the case and provide Mr Perkin with a full response

Social services told his son the nurse was South American and hadn’t understood she was not meant to shave him completely.

A spokesman for Kingston Hospital 
said investigations established that the incident had been ‘an innocent 
and unfortunate mistake’ by a nurse.

‘The nurse wanted to tidy and clean 
him up and did not shave his moustache off intentionally,’  she added. 
‘We are all truly sorry  for any distress this has caused  Mr Perkin.’

The hospital said there was ‘no evidence’ Mr Perkin was denied any care as a result of the complaint.
