Russell Brand was held to task by mothers up and down the country this afternoon, after taking part in a Mumsnet webchat. 

The comic was propositioned several times from members of the parenting website, with some of the women even offering to run away with him. 

The conversation covered everything from custard creams and spray tans to feminism and the problem with the voting system.

But he was also hung out to dry for his previous treatment of women, including using prostitutes.

At one point Russell did appear to be confused by the types of conversations he appeared to be having. 

When one user asked what he had imagined Mumsnet to be like, he responded: 'I thought there'd be a lot more mums and people with prams and more breastfeeding.'

Several of the women posting questions made their affections for the star very clear, one said: 'I'm totally up for it btw,' while another wrote: 'Thank you for regularly popping up in my dreams ;-) #mumsnetfilthbench.' 

 One lady went as far as to openly ask Russell about whether he was attracted to older women. 

The user Grey Gardens wrote: 'Do you have a soft spot for dark-haired, sultry, older women who also support West Ham?' 

Russell replied: 'Yes –very much. I'm forever blowing bubbles, West Ham forever. Let's run away from all this.'

The 39-year-old also tackled some of his biggest gripes about the current ruling party, but not before disclosing his feelings on the perfect biscuit.

Despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country's elite, Russell (pictured here at Occupy Wall Street) admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished 

When asked what his favourite biccie was, he said: 'I know this a sensitive issue - I would say Penguins and Wagon Wheels, although some would say they are not biscuits as they are individually-packaged. 

'I also quite like a Custard Creams. 

'I am against Rich Teas - you might as well eat a communion wafer.' 

On a more serious note, Russell Brand claimed that David Cameron and the fellow members of his Conservative government were stunted from their privileged childhoods, which saw many educated in private boarding schools.  

Russell was on he site top promote his new book Revolution 

He said: 'I think that's really significant and an overlooked aspect of it. 

'We are being governed by people who have been brought up in compassion-less paddocks and inculcated in solipsism.'

Russell, who has been on the promo trail with his new book Revolution in recent weeks, went on to claim that there was more of a point in voting in television talent shows like the X Factor than in a local or general election.

He said: 'When we vote for One Direction or Chery Cole, it makes a difference - if you vote for David Cameron, it doesn't.'

But despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country's elite, Russell admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished. 

When asked if we needed the royal family, he said: 'No... I'm conflicted. Because I love the pageantry, the outfits, the ceremony. 

But I know in my heart that it's a symbol of elitism and the hierarchy - how could it be anything else.'

Russell also used the conversation to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women.

In his earlier years of fame, he would often sleep with a different girl every night and once bragged of  having sex with nine girls in one evening. 

He has also spoken openly of using sex workers during his teenage years and went into detail about one experience with a Filipino prostitute during a television show earlier this year.

The women on the site attacked him often for his past use of working girls and many claimed that he was a misogynist.

He replied: 'I hope I was never a misogynist. 

'Complicated, being a man: primal drives, compassion, spiritual awakening, need for status - a tangled, knotted mess of threads, when unraveled all lead to..... not misogyny I hope. 

Russell also used the conversation on the parenting website to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women. The comic has admitted to using prostitutes when he was younger - before he met his ex-wife Katy Perry 

'Sometimes, I said things that were a bit sexist, I think it's the same way my nan was a bit racist, she was a product of her time and environment, her natural compassion rebuffed and redirected by the culture of Dagenham. 

'With reflection, and contemplation, we all arrive at a place of non-judgement.

'In the past I have done things that are regrettable. 

'I was a heroin addict, a criminal, selfish, egotistical. 

'Obviously, I'm still not perfect, I'm travelling in the right direction. 

'If we preclude the possibility for change and improvement, then who among us isn't f****d?'  

As well as admitting regret over his past, Russell was also keen to join the likes of Nick Clegg and Ed Milliband in claiming himself a fan of the feminist cause.  

When asked by one reader if he was a feminist, he said: 'I don't know what the requirements are. I certainly support equal rights regardless of age race and sexual persuasion. 

'I also think a good many of the problems we face in society are because of a gender imbalance because women have been unrepresented for centuries.' 

Since returning from Hollywood, Russell Brand has been getting increasingly involved in politics. Here he is alongside Tessa Jowell and Boris Johnson on an episode of Question Time 

As well as promoting his new book Revolution, Russell also  revealed that he would be concentrating much of his literary efforts on extending his range of children's books.  

He said: 'I started writing for children because I think fairy stories are important moral and ethical codes and I think a lot of the problems we face now are because we're trying to live without a map - we've lost touch with religion and spirituality. 

'And by talking directly to children, there's a possibility of communicating directly with the thing in all of us that understands what it is to be good, and aligned and compassionate, before we get muddled up by adulthood.

'I am planning on writing some more children's books, including Rumpelstiltskin.' 

Despite his regular speeches on the wicked elite and appearance at anti-capitalism protests here in the UK, Russell does maintain that there are several aspects of the country that he is still proud of.

When asked what he loves about Britain, he said: 'Everything. 

'Loads of things: our sense of humour, our language, our football teams, our sense of fairness and justice and our willingness to embrace new cultures.'  

The star had a slightly shorter list when asked what he missed about his birth county of Essex, he said: 'The people. And the spray tans.'
