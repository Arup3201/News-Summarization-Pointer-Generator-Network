Monday morning commuters had to deal with ‘utter chaos’ on the railways yesterday after a computer fault wiped station information screens.

Passengers all around the country complained of missing trains or getting on the wrong ones as live train information went out of sync with arrivals or disappeared from platform screens altogether.

The glitch also caused smartphone apps which track live train arrivals to show incorrect times – with many falsely saying trains were significantly delayed.

Network Rail said a ‘server crash’ was responsible for the problem, which started in the middle of the morning rush hour and took at least two hours to resolve. Some passengers were still complaining of problems at 1.20pm.

Several train companies asked commuters to tweet them for live travel details as complaints about a lack of announcements or information from station staff flooded social media.

Commuter Steve Grant, who was trying to get a train from East Croydon, said the station was in ‘utter chaos’ with information boards saying ‘nothing’.

‘Marc’ wrote on Twitter: ‘Should be a fun commute. The station info boards and audio announcements are broken so no one has any idea what train is arriving or when.’

Domenic Donatantonio tweeted: ‘Back to 1995 today. Neither Southern Rail app, station display or station worker can tell when train will arrive.’

A Twitter user in Scotland wrote: ‘@ScotRail you’ll be pleased to know I missed my train due to bad information and having to check’, while a passenger in Sheffield complained no one knew which platform they were supposed to get as the information boards were blank and there were no announcements.

Others complained the lack of information meant they were not told about changes to services.

Joseph Thompson wrote: ‘7:53 Denmark Hill to Dartford platform changed, passengers only told 5 mins after it left, everyone missed train.’

Another Twitter user said: ‘The 8:39 came before the 8:30 but they said it was the 8:30 not the 8:39 so now I’ve missed my train and all the others are delayed.’

Sam Hind tweeted Northern Rail saying: ‘You might want to sort your app out @northernrailorg, giving incorrect info meaning I missed the train. Six mins late but quoted 20. Great job.’

A message from the South West Trains official Twitter account said station staff were ‘also affected by the same problem’ so could not provide any more information to passengers.

Network Rail said servers which provide information to display screens crashed and had to be restarted, meaning it took some time for them to catch up.

A spokesman said: ‘We experienced some problems with our servers which a caused a loss of data to train operators’ information systems.

‘The server was restarted and all data feeds are now processing as they should. There was some delay whilst the systems processed the backlog of data.

‘We apologise to any passengers whose journey was disrupted by this malfunction.’
