A 16-year-old accused of opening fire in an ice rink in Manhattan's Bryant Park grinned, laughed and cursed at reporters as he was led by police to a court arraignment on Monday evening.

'F*** all you n******,' Corey Dunton yelled as two detectives from the Midtown South Precinct station ushered him into a waiting car before driving to the court.

Dunton is accused of shooting two people at the ice rink on Saturday night, including Adonis Mera, an innocent 14-year-old who may be paralyzed from the waist down.

The shooting was reportedly over a 'biggie' jacket.

But, according to the New York Daily News, the Bronx teen told reporters, smirking: 'It wasn't over a jacket. It was over your mother, n*****.'

Dunton was charged with attempted murder on Sunday after he allegedly shot at skaters and then seemed to confess to the crime on Facebook.

During an hour-long standoff at his Bronx apartment on Sunday morning, Corey Dunton, 16, wrote on the social media website: 'Feds trien [sic] kick down my door its over were do i go from hereeeee...[I don't know] wat to do i f----ed up.'

Minutes later, he added: 'These n----s gunna have to take me out take my life … I aint goin to jail i reather [sic] take my life!!'

He is suspected to be a member of the Bloods gang.

When police began banging on his door at
 around 8 a.m., he posted: 'Feds at my door Im goin out with a 
bang!!!!!!! take my soul.'

Detained for questioning: Corey Dunton is suspected by the NYPD of carrying out the shooting at Bryant Park skating rink that left two people hospitalized

When he finally emerged, he was taken
 to the Midtown South precinct house in Manhattan after he was arrested 
but he refused to answer questions and demanded a lawyer.

The teenager allegedly fired on 
Javier Contreras, 20, of the Bronx, but in doing so hit Mera
 of Manhattan.

Police
 believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth 
'biggie' jacket he was wearing and was shot in the hand and the hips.

A source with the NYPD confirmed that Contreras and Dunton knew each other.

The arrest of Dunton comes after the distraught family of 14-year-old Mera expressed their fears he will never walk again.

Currently being held in Bellevue Hospital in a critical but stable condition, Mera's brother Jorge Arias told the New York Daily News he visited his injured sibling.

'I didn't really try to get him to speak,' Arias, 24, said. 'I just wanted to see his face. He's a baby. He's a little kid.'

Contreras was approached by the gunman and asked to hand over his jacket. When he refused the shooter left the rink but returned minutes later to unleash three gunshots - hitting both Contreras and Mera.

This is not the first time the puffy 'biggie' jacket has become a source of problems in New York.

The jacket, which costs $600, is believed to be the source of a scuffle in the Lower East Side earlier this year which led to Raphael Ward, 16, being shot in the chest over the coat.

The coat was discontinued by Paragon Sports last year and as such has become a desirable and rare piece of fashion.

The shocking incident happened just 
after 11pm Saturday, on the skating rink in the heart of the popular 
midtown park located at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue.

Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene.

'People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn't run,' said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park's second-floor restaurant Celsius.

'People were scared they didn't know what was going on,' he said.

Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter.

He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room.

'We didn't know anything. The shooter could've been a lunatic with a machine gun,' he said.

A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire.

In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks.

A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, 'My brother just got shot in front of my face.'

Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was his friend Adonis Mera.

Mera's friend who witnessed the shooting said the teen told him he could not feel his legs

According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice.

On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!'

Shortly before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people.

Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. 

Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.'

NYPD officers 
converged on the park after receiving reports of shots fired and 
quarantined some 50  skaters, who were later released after being 
questioned by police.

Joe
 Carella, a spokesman for Bryant Park Corporation, the not-for-profit 
company that privately manages the park, said the public area is virtually 
crime free.

In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers.

The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a 'small miracle.'

Quarantine: Police secured the rink and questioned the park goers before letting them leave

These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months.

In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.
