An Ohio father of four is being hailed as a hero after he drowned saving a girl he didn't even know from Lake Erie.

Peter Radke, 43, was at a birthday party for one of his teenage daughters in Huntington Beach, Ohio, Saturday night when he noticed a 14-year-old girl who was caught in rough water.

Mr Radke dived into the chilly waters and pushed the teen onto a rock outcropping, where others could pull her to safety.

Mr Radke's friends and co-workers said they were not surprised when they heard that had selflessly jumped in the water to save a stranger

Moments later, Mr Radke disappeared beneath the swells as his children watched in horror

Rescuers found his body three hours later in shallow water near the beach.

'This man is a hero. He went into help a young woman and lost his life in the process,' Chris Lyons, the fire chief of nearby Bay Village, told WJW-TV.

Mr Radke's friends said he was a strong swimmer. They wonder whether he hit his head on a rock before sinking beneath the water.

The loving father was active in his church and worked as a social media specialist at an Akron advertising firm.

No one who knew him was surprised he put himself in danger to help a stranger.

The teenager was taken to the hospital, but is expected to survive.

'He gave his life for hers. There’s a passage of scripture that jumped to my mind right away. In talking about Jesus, it says "There’s no greater love that a man has than to lay down his life for a friend" - that’s what you’re looking at. A guy who gave his life for a kid,' Jeff Bogue, the senior pastor at Mr Radke's church, told the Akron Beacon-Journal.

'While we never expected to lose him so soon, we take comfort in knowing Pete's final moments were spent saving the life of another,' his family said in a statement.
