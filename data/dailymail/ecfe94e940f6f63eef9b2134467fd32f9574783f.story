Jennifer Hudson warned her sister not to marry the man who is suspected of murdering her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew, it has emerged.

Police interviewed the Oscar-winner shortly after the murders at her 
mother's home in the Englewood neighbourhood of Chicago in 2008.

Ms Hudson said she knew something was wrong on the morning of October 24, 2008, when she couldn't reach her mother - whom she spoke to daily - according to documents filed by prosecutors last week.

Murder trial: William Balfour is the estranged husband of Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia. He is accused of killing her mother, brother and nephew four years ago

Hudson’s mother Darnell Hudson Donerson, 57, and older brother Jason, 29, were found dead at the family’s home on Chicago’s south side in 2008.

The singer then offered $100,000 for her missing
nephew Julian King's safe return. The child's body was found three days later in a
 vehicle on the city’s west side with multiple gun shot wounds.

Ms Hudson is on the witness list for the trial of her sister's estranged husband William Balfour who is accused of killing her family.

However the Chicago Tribune reported that prosecutors haven’t yet disclosed whether Hudson will actually testify at Balfour’s trial, which is slated to begin April 9.

Balfour, the estranged husband of Hudson’s sister Julia, had a known history of violence and a criminal record.

In 2008, detectives interviewed Ms Hudson at a 
hotel in downtown Chicago after she flew from Miami with 
her fiance David Otunga to help identify the bodies.

Ms Hudson told 
investigators she had known Balfour since childhood and had been against her
sister marrying him.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Ms 
Hudson told police there was tension in her family over her sister's 
relationship with Balfour as he treated her badly.

Her family 
hadn't known of her sister's marriage to him in late 2006 until 
months later.

Balfour allegedly once threatened to kill her sister because he thought she was having an affair with a colleague, Hudson told police.

Balfour's trial is set to begin on April 9 although witnesses would not take the stand until two weeks later.

There
 is likely to be heightened media attention in Balfour's trial because 
of Hudson's celebrity.

Defense lawyers want to quiz potential jurors as 
to how much they know about Hudson's music career or films before the trial, according to
 the Tribune.

The 
Dreamgirls actress, who found fame as a contestant on American Idol, has
 previously referred to her heartbreak over the murders but never in great detail.

It
 emerged last year that she had signed a $1million book deal to 
chronicle her dramatic 80-pound weight loss after the birth of her son in 2009.

Her
 memoir I Got This: How I Changed My Ways and Lost What Weighed Me Down 
was published last month.

It was rumoured at the time that publishers 
were shying away from any book by the WeightWatchers spokeswoman 
which didn't focus of her family's murders, according to radaronline.com.
