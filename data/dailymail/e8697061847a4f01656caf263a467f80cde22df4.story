'Generation rent' could lead to the Conservative Party losing crucial support as home ownership becomes a 'relic' of the 1980s, according to experts.

The number of 25 to 34-year-olds with a home of their own has fallen from two million to 1.3million in only a decade, the latest figures from the 2011 census show.

Levels of home ownership have slumped to just 64 per cent overall, its lowest since the mid-1980s when Margaret Thatcher declared that she wanted more people to be able to buy a house.

The number of 25 to 34-year-olds who own their own home fell from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in the 2011 census

Only 40 per cent of young people owned their home in the 2011 survey of households compared with 58 per cent a decade earlier.

Two million young adults rented their property compared with 1.5million in 2001.

More than 8.3million of the overall population of England and Wales rent their homes - the highest number since 1961 as rising house prices outstrip incomes.

Those renting from private landlords or letting agents were up 1.7million to 3.6million compared with the 2001 census, while those in social housing fell by about 100,000 to 4.1million.

Nick Faith, of the think tank, Policy Exchange, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Research shows that private renters and people living in social housing are less likely to vote Tory.

'That is why the Government needs to have an honest conversation about the need to build more quality housing, especially in urban and suburban areas. That’s where younger people tend to want to live.'

The Office for National Statistics said the new figures, the first to show how many in each age group are renters or homeowners, suggest a decline in the number of first time buyers.

The age group with the highest number of homeowners was the 65 to 74-year-olds, where 76 per cent have bought the house they live in.

Emma Stone, of the Joseph Rowntree 
Foundation, told the newspaper that a million people in 'Generation 
Rent' may not be able to buy their own homes until 2020.

She
 said: 'Margaret Thatcher’s vision for a property-owning democracy 
increasingly looks like a relic from the 1980s — unless we address the 
chronic shortage of homes to improve affordability and supply.'

The breakdown of renters and homeowners came as it emerged that the average UK house price has risen to £168,941, with the London average at an all-time high of £318,214 - 5 per cent above the previous pre-credit crunch peak in 2007.

House prices have seen their fastest 
rise in almost three years, with a recovery experienced in ten out of 13
 areas of the country.

Nationwide, which released the figures, said Government efforts to 
kick-start the market, as well as a lack of available homes to choose 
from, helped to bolster prices.

Official figures last month showed the number of 
grown-up children living at home, who are also known as the ‘boomerang 
generation’, has jumped by 20 per cent since 1997.

The
 ONS estimates 1.8million men and 1.1million 
women between the age of 20 and 34 are living with their parents.

Homeless
 charity Shelter told the Telegraph it would take 12 years for a young 
family to save for deposit on their first home, double the time for a 
child-free couples in their twenties.

Over the past year, prices rose 1.9 per cent, pushing the country¿s average to £168,941

Chief executive Campbell Robb said the Coalition had 'missed an opportunity' in this week's spending review to invest in more affordable housing across the country.

He said: 'For successive governments, politicians have claimed that home ownership is a central theme, important for people and communities.

'The trouble is that the rhetoric and reality are further apart than they have ever been.'
