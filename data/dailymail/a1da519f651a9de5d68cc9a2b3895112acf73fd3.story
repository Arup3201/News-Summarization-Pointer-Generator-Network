Arran Tosh, 13, from Sudbury, Suffolk, died on June 7, just five days after being diagnosed with a brain tumour

A 13-year-old boy who launched a solo mission to raise £1,000 for a cancer charity has died from a brain tumour - just days after it was detected through a routine eye test.

Arran Tosh had no idea he was critically-ill until he visited the opticians in his home town in Sudbury, Suffolk, less than two weeks ago.

The optician spotted pressure behind his eye and Arran was sent to hospital for further tests, where he was diagnosed with a slow-growing tumour.

But despite having emergency surgery that same week, the young boy died - just five days after being diagnosed.

Arran's diagnosis came just months after he had set up a JustGiving page to raise money for Cancer Research UK.

Arran was inspired to set up the page after his auntie Kerry was diagnosed with breast cancer. He vowed to shave his head if he reached his £1,000 target.

Donations have now poured in to Arran's website from all over 
the world. The total amount raised through the page, which was at £750 when Arran died, had reached £11,500 this morning.

His mother Alison, 43, said her son would be stunned by the generosity of the donations.

She said she and the rest of Arran's family were now hoping to set up a permanent trust in his name.

She said: 'Arran hoped to teach music, drama or 
history one day, but in the meantime, he just wanted to do as much as he
 could for charity.

'He 
said if he could reach the £1,000 for Cancer Research he would then 
raise money for HCPT - The Pilgrimage Trust - which takes children with 
special needs on pilgrimage to Lourdes in France.'

Arran's diagnosis came after he went for a routine eye test on May 31, where the optician detected some 
pressure behind his eyes.

The optician booked Arran in for an MRI scan and
 further eye tests at West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, three days later.

Those tests showed Arran had been living with a slow-growing brain tumour. Arran was then rushed to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, for surgery.

But surgeons were unable to remove all the tumour and Arran was put on a life support. He died five days after his diagnosis, on Saturday, June 7.

Mrs Tosh told the Cambridge News: 'He came round, he 
was quite sleepy. But then there were complications with not being able 
to remove all of the tumour.

'Because
 the tumour was slow-growing and had been growing for years he could 
have been busking, playing football, with his friends or on his own with
 no family around him and just collapsed.'

Arran’s sister Abbie, 18, said the family was so proud of what Arran had achieved.

She said: 'He is my little angel and I am so 
proud of everything he has achieved, not only after his passing but when
 he was with us too.

Arran, pictured here with his sisters, his mother Alison
 and his father Stephen, had recently set up a JustGiving page to raise 
money for Cancer Research UK. He planned to shave his head if he raised 
£1,000 for the cause

'Arran
 would light up any room as soon as he walked into it and his smile was 
contagious - this is something that will carry on happening through his 
spirit.

'Although my little 
brother is no longer with us, I will forever love him and miss him, and I
 will always be proud of the young man he was.'

Donations have poured into the JustGiving page since Arran's death. His 
mother Alison, pictured above with her son, said he would be stunned by 
people's generosity

Arran, a keen footballer, had recently busked outside the Cancer Research charity shop in Sudbury to raise money for the cause.

His
 auntie Tracy Milligan said: 'Arran was tirelessly raising money for 
Cancer Research, inspired by his other auntie and a family friend who 
suffered the terrible disease.

'Then out of the blue last Monday morning, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

'With his family by his side, he calmly and bravely went into battle on Tuesday morning with that huge smile of his and a determined attitude.'

Mrs Tosh, along with his sisters Abbie and Chloe, 20, and his father Stephen, are now hoping to set up The Smile of Arran to continue with the teenager's fundraising mission.

Mrs Tosh said: 'Although Arran had so much ability and was so talented, he was never arrogant.

'He had a wonderful sense of humour and all he ever wanted to be was someone who made people happy - and he wanted to make other people’s lives easier.'

Arran loved singing and played the guitar with his band, The Stopclocks.

He was also an enthusiastic sportsman and aspiring actor.

Supporters left heartbreaking messages as they contributed to Arran’s cause on his JustGiving page.

The Keep family of Leavenheath, Suffolk, said: 'We weren’t lucky enough to have known you Arran but your story has touched our hearts. God bless and sleep tight x'

Lez said: 'Heard about this darling boy from a friend on twitter and it broke my heart. I am in Australia. God love you forever Arran.'

Hilary Scott said: 'In tears even though I did know Arran or his family. No words just respect for this brave little man.'

J Rout said: 'Such a blessing to have taught Arran at Hedingham. My prayers are with the family. Heavens choir has gained a wonderful soul. Keep them all in tune up there Arran!'

Amelia & Edward O’Connell said: 'Life won’t be the same without you. Your cheery smile will always be remembered. I am so lucky to have met such a great person. Our thoughts are with you and your family. Rest in peace Arran xxx'
