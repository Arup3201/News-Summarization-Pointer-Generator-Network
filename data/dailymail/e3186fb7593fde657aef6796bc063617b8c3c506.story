An ex-publicist and lawyer for the rap duo Insane Clown Posse has sued them and their recording company, saying she was sexually harassed and asked to perform illegal acts.

Andrea Pellegrini, 32, filed the lawsuit on August 23 in Oakland County Circuit Court in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac.

The defendants include group members Joseph 'Shaggy 2 Dope' Bruce and Joseph 'Violent J' Utsler and Psychopathic Records.

The Associated Press left phone and email messages Tuesday night for group spokesman Jason Webber.

The complaint says Pellegrini was 'subjected to constant and pervasive harassment' at the company, including being given a large sex toy and a product with Kegel-like qualities, The Detroit News reported.

It says she was asked to obtain automatic weapons for a photo shoot.

According to The Detroit Free Press, the lawsuit describes her experience at the 2012 Gathering of the Juggalos as 'a living hell,' including being relegated to using bathrooms 'often full with naked male strangers.'

Pellegrini worked at Psychopathic Records in 2009-2012, then was fired.

The 86-count complaint also names William Dail, president of Psychopathic Records, as well as Psychopathic Records employees Robert Bruce and Dan Diamond.

According to Marko, Pellegrini was instructed by executives at the record label to deceive government investigators from the U.S. Department of Labor during an investigation.

She said she refused and reported the sexual harassment and was subsequently terminated.

Howard Hertz, an attorney for Pyschopathic and ICP, told The Detroit Free Press on Tuesday: 'The allegations are untrue. Ms Pellegrini was terminated for poor job performance. I can't comment further because the matter is in litigation.'

Pellegrini initially didn't want to file the complaint for fear she'd be blacklisted in the industry, her lawyer said.

He said she has since got another job but it pays 'a lot less.'

'We're asking for a substantial amount of money to compensate her for what sheâ€™s gone through and is continuing to go through,' said Marko, adding that the woman had undergone counseling.
