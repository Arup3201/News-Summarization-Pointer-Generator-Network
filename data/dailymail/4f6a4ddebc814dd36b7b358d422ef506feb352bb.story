Proud father: Jason Robert Bell has spoken about birth of son Ajax

They spent weeks grooming the media for the maximum publicity they could get.

But now it appears that the 
performance artist who gave birth in front of a gallery audience has 
become rather shy of the attention she is receiving.

Marni Kotak said that she did not expect the amount of interest for her ‘work’ and that she is finding it hard to cope whilst nursing her first child.

Her husband Jason Robert Bell 
revealed she is ‘totally afraid’ whilst their friends claimed she feels 
like there is a ‘bounty on the picture of her first child’.

Mr Bell confessed that ‘artists like attention because it pays the bills’ but denied that their motivation was to be famous.

He also revealed that his and Miss 
Kotak’s families had a ‘mixed’ reaction to their plans and that none of 
them had even been informed by them when it was happening - so none 
attended the event.

Ajax Bell was born at the tiny Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York weighing 9lbs 2oz on Tuesday at 10.17am.

Miss Kotak - who said giving birth is
 the 'highest form of art' - had set up a home-birth centre at the 
gallery and turned it into a brightly decorated bedroom with ocean blue 
walls and photo-imprinted pillows, along with a shower.

According to those who attended, the 
space was ‘steamy’ and after Ajax was born the placenta was put in a 
bowl that had been lying around.

Among the invited onlookers and ‘art friends’ were a couple expecting a baby who wanted to see what a birth would be like.

Mr Bell revealed that the entire 
process lasted around 24 hours - he and Miss Kotak, 36, arrived around 
5pm on the Monday and left at 6pm or 7pm on the next day following the 
morning birth.

Around 20 people were there for the 
Ajax’s arrival and they helped to clean up and bring food to the new 
mother - including a Chinese takeaway dinner of sesame chicken with 
broccoli.

A midwife they had hired was present 
but there were no medicines and it was a natural birth which caused Miss
 Kotak ‘the worst pain in her life’.

Mr Bell, 39, said the couple hardly slept on the first night of having their child at home and were exhausted.

He added that his wife was ‘very 
surprised by all the attention’ it had received - even though the event 
had been featured extensively in the media.

Shuttered: The gallery was closed Wednesday after Tuesday's 'exhibit', titled The Birth of Baby X, and it's website said it would reopen with normal business hours on Thursday

‘Marni has been doing things like this for years and no-one has cared,’ he said.

‘Restaging funerals and doing all 
things that were very public/private and stuff.  Things that she thought
 would be crazy.  She’s a performance artist, she went to school for 
performance art, she’s been doing performance art for over 10 years.

‘Artists like attention because it 
pays the bills. There’s much easier ways to get attention than give 
birth in public, that’s pretty crazy doing it for that reason.

‘If you were doing this would be you 
doing it in some lackadaisical silly manner? Would you be doing this 
just to seek attention? That’s kind of monstrous to do that.

‘My wife has integrity. There’s a 
history of people that do stuff like this in galleries and what’s 
interesting in all the past one, it’s like: ‘This guy shot a dog in an 
art gallery’, this guy got shot by someone in an art gallery, but this 
wasn’t somebody getting hurt in a gallery, this was a positive thing.

‘That’s the difference.’

Scene of the birth: The Microscope Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, turned into a makeshift maternity Tuesday ward when Marni Kotak gave birth to her son Ajax, in front of a crowd of 20 non-relatives

He added that some people said some ‘really nasty stuff’ on the Internet which had upset them.

He said: ‘Now she (Miss Kotak) is 
totally afraid because she didn’t understand it was going to be in the 
news. She didn’t understand it was going to freak people out.’

Speaking from his home in Brooklyn near to the gallery, Mr Bell described himself and his wife as ‘just two Bohemian artists’.

He admitted that both his and his wife’s family only found out about their plans through news reports and not from themselves.

He said: ‘The family did not express an interest in being there but they were interested afterwards.

My brother said afterward: ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’

‘Overall there was a mixed reaction. My mum thought it was pretty cool that the birth of her grandson was international news’.

Mr Bell said he chose the name Ajax 
as an ‘intelligence test’ to see if people how people would react:  - if
 they said the detergent instead of the Greek God then he knew they an 
idiot

If Ajax had been a girl he would have been called Xara.

All set: Marni is now terrified of the media attention but her painter-artist husband Jason Robert Bell spoke briefly Wednesday

Among those who saw the birth was 
Katarina Hybenova who wrote on bushwickdaily.com that Miss Kotak 
experienced the 'unforgettable moment' surrounded by a 'handful of 
randomly chosen participants'.

She said: 'I was one of the lucky 
ones attending, and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical. I believe
 that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional, raw 
and true 'piece of art'.

'I feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with Marni, using the commonly created positive energy.'

Araceli Cruz, of the VillageVoice blog, said she just missed out on witnessing the birth.

She also revealed, in a post that the baby measured 21 inches long.

She said: 'We first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery.

'Although we were one of the select 
few to attend the live birth, an art performance/installation by Marni 
Kotak, we, unfortunately, didn't arrive in time.

'What we did find when we entered the
 steamy space, which the artist converted into a birthing centre, was 
Kotak calmly eating a banana, the placenta in a bowl and the baby's 
father, Jason, holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel.

'The beautiful baby boy was 
wide-eyed, and as quiet as could be, staring blankly into the camera and
 video lenses that hovered above him.

A video of the birth will be added to
 forthcoming exhibition at the gallery, and forms the start of an 18 
year project which called Raising Baby X, where Miss Kotak will document
 her child's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts.

She launched the exhibition on 
October 8 and the gallery's opening hours were extended so that she 
could develop a rapport with members of the public.

The Microscope gallery  is a scruffy building located in a downtrodden part of Bushwick in Brooklyn.

The one storey structure appears to be an extension of the house next to it and has a flat roof crudely fashioned out of metal.

On the front are three black metal shutters and a black metal bench sits outside.

On one side is a photographer’s 
studio space and on the other a coffee shop which has been covered in 
graffiti, but over the road is what appears to be a car dump being 
guarded by an elderly man and his dog.

Further down the road is a small patch of wasteland whilst round the corner is a Family Dollar discount store and a KFC.

Whilst Miss Kotak’s friends have been unsurprisingly supportive, not all of those living close to the gallery were behind her.

Ari Sneider, 26, who lives very close
 to the gallery and runs a moped shop down the road, said: ‘This is just
 exploiting the child for the benefit of his parents.

‘Nobody had heard of their small gallery in Brooklyn before this, and now everyone knows where it is.

‘The baby did not have any say in how he came into this world – how do we know this is what he would have wanted.

‘Kids can be really mean and if there is anything different about them they get teased, and this kid is going to get teased.

‘By the time he gets old enough to understand it then he won’t be old enough to care, but then it will be too late.

‘I think it’s attention seeking and, even in our age of sharing everything on the Internet, a step too far’.

Ready: The gallery has been converted into a birthing room for Marni

But Henry Glucroft, 26, one of the 
owners of the Little Skips cafe next door to the Microscope Gallery, 
said that he knew Miss Kotak and respected what she did.

He said: ‘I think it is challenging our idea about where we can be born and how it takes place.

‘If this had happened in the Upper East Side (of New York) there would be uproar, but people here are different and accepting’.

He also admitted that in a gallery 
was ‘not where I want my child to be born’, but that he thought the 
attention was ‘good for our neighbourhood’.

A friend of Miss Kotak said that the 
couple did not really understand the mess they were getting into and may
 have done things differently in hindsight.

The friend said: ‘She feels like there’s a bounty on the first picture of her child

‘Perhaps she should have, could have thought about this a bit more and realised what would happen after the birth.

‘She and Jason are now finding it 
very difficult to cope with all of this attention whilst dealing with a 
newborn baby. They’ve had enough’.

The friend denied that Miss Kotak was
 being hypocritical, but admitted that ‘they might not have fully 
realised what they let themselves in for’.
