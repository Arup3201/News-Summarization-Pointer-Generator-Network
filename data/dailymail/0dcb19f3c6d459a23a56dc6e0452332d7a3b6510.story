A policeman who sexually assaulted an innocent man with a broomstick handle in the toilets of a New York police station has secretly married his 'childhood sweetheart' in prison - 13 years into his life sentence.

Justin Volpe married Caroline Rose DeMaso in a simple ceremony at Florida's Federal Correctional Complex on May 13 this year, according to reports.

But it will be a long wait before the couple 
can consummate the marriage as conjugal visits are banned in Federal 
prisons and Volpe is not due for parole until April 3 2025 at the 
earliest.

Volpe was jailed for 30 years in 1999 after he admitted dragging Haitian Abner Louima into the toilets of a Brooklyn police station and torturing him with the wooden implement following his arrest outside a nightclub.

Volpe then emerged from the bathroom holding a pair of blood-soaked leather gloves before declaring: 'I broke a man down.'

But while the horrific and humiliating attack shocked America, sparking racial tensions across New York, Ms DeMaso could not let it cloud her love for the disgraced lawman.

According to the New York Daily News, an unnamed source said the couple, who are both originally from Staten Island, had been childhood sweethearts but followed different paths.

She then married a Brooklyn police officer, now with the city's mounted police division, who she later divorced.

The couple were married in his Florida jail, registered by the federal Bureau of Prisons, on May 13 this year,  witnessed by Volpe’s mother, Grace, and a relative of the bride, the newspaper claimed.

And far from the usual attire of top hats and tails, Volpe was forced to say 'I do' wearing his khaki prison clothes - emblazoned with his inmate number 49477-053 - and standard-issue training shoes.

He was, however, allowed to wear his new gold band back to his cell when the ceremony was over.

'It’s happened, thanks be to God,' the Reverend Thomas Devery, who presided over the nuptials, told the Daily News. 'They’re very happy, and that’s it.'

Evidence: This photograph of Louima, introduced as evidence by the prosecution in Volpe's trial, was allegedly taken by police shortly after Louima was brutalized

Volpe was jailed for a minimum of 30 
years for the attack that left Louima with multiple injuries for which 
he was hospitalised for two months. He later received an $8.7million 
payout by the city.

At first Volpe denied the assault, and even called on a colleague Charles Schwartz to testify on his behalf. Schwartz was convicted of perjury over the cover up and sentenced to serve five years.

Volpe later admitted during his trial that he targetted Louima in retaliation for a punch thrown at his head in a brawl outside a nightclub in Flatbush. It later emerged another man had thrown the punch.

Jailing him for 30 years Federal Judge Eugene Nickerson told the court: 'Short of intentional murder, one cannot imagine a more barbarous 
misuse of power than Volpe's.'

Volpe has since apologised for the assault which sparked a wave of racial tension in the city, again throwing the spotlight on the issue of racism within the force.

Volpe claimed the attack was not racially motivated, pointing to the fact that he was at the time in a three-year cohabitational relationship with a black woman.

Father of three Louima had moved to New 
York from Haiti seven years before the attack. He used some of the 
payout to pay for schooling for children in his homeland.

He would not comment on the marriage.
 His lawyer, though, told the Daily News: 'What’s important is for 
police officers throughout the country to be reminded of his 30-year 
prison sentence, which demonstrates police officers will be held 
criminally accountable for perpetrating criminal acts against innocent 
victims.'
