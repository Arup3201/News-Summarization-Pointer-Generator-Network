After the implosion at the Stadium of Light ended the chaotic reign of Paolo Di Canio, Sunderland’s target was Premier League survival.

As hope has replaced resignation with improved performances, a new and welcome objective has appeared which may bring the club’s first major trophy since their famous FA Cup victory in 1973.

Five months ago, when Gus Poyet took over as head coach, cup competitions were a distraction.

When his side face Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday he is acutely aware of what a triumph against the odds will mean to the club and their success-starved fans.

Poyet knew that his first job when he was appointed in October was to build bridges after the Di Canio regime had managed to create so many chasms.

The Uruguayan became the first Sunderland manager for more than a decade actually to live in the city. He is constantly out and about and meeting the fans.

Emotions: There was never a dull moment on the touchline when Paolo Di Canio was in charge of Sunderland

At the club, he made it a priority to rebuild the links between the playing and backroom staff. He knows the name of every cleaner, chef and office worker. He shakes their hands, gives hugs, high fives and smiles.

He was the same at Chelsea, Tottenham and Brighton. Poyet quickly set about unpicking some of the more troublesome Di Canio diktats.

For instance, the Italian ordered his players to eat in specific groups but the only meal Poyet wanted his players to attend, with their partners, was in their first full week together.

What happened in the Sunderland restaurant called Romanos stayed in Romanos but a decision was reached never to mention you-know-who again. And it’s the one name you will not hear uttered by the players this weekend.

Jack Colback, one of a handful not on international duty, remembers Poyet’s first day. ‘I was looking forward to his company,’ the midfielder said. ‘There was relief in the dressing room.

‘I remember playing against his Brighton team and we didn’t touch the ball for the first 20 minutes.

‘I knew that was the sort of manager he was and it wasn’t a style of football I’d been involved with before so I was looking forward to it.

‘Gus is very detailed in what he does. He looks for things and angles you might not have thought of. He’s serious when he needs to be but calm at other times and relaxed when he wants to be.

‘He brings a spirit and camaraderie into the squad and it’s a good mix. His staff are the same as well. He has got an angry side and rightly so at times. There have been times we’ve not played well and he lets us know about it.

‘When he first came in everyone wanted to impress and he just said “Relax”. He didn’t try to come in and change everything but he tried to change things slowly.’

The drills emphasise  passing, the training-ground matches encourage passing, even shooting practice is based on passing. There are smiles and laughter in the sessions, but a hardworking environment.

And, when Poyet wants a word, he takes the player for a little walk and a chat round the pitches.

There is no shouting and screaming and no former pro in his forties, showing off his torso, or how it should be done. Players are treated like adults again.

While Poyet’s influence has been remarkable, he would be the first to praise the initial work done by Under 21 coach and former captain Kevin Ball, who was called on by owner Ellis Short to step in after Di Canio departed with just one point from the first five league games.

Caretaker: Sunderland initially turned to Kevin Ball when Di Canio was sacked

It was Ball’s job to repair the damage, install a more realistic code of conduct and restore some belief, fitness, confidence and even enjoyment on the training ground.

Ball’s team, with Lee Cattermole at the heart of midfield, beat Peterborough 2-0 in the second round of the Capital One Cup. It followed the 4-2 first-round win over MK Dons, notable for a Jozy Altidore goal and being Di Canio’s only victory in six before he was sacked.

Sensing this was his opportunity to stake a claim to manage a club close to his heart, Ball approached the job as if it was his already.

Cattermole, like Phil Bardsley, was ostracised by Di Canio and while their recall and welcome back into the first-team dressing room was an obvious decision, it was still a significant one.

Ball, who was in the last Sunderland team to reach a Wembley final in 1992, said at the time: ‘The players are professional and know we’re disciplined and work  hard and won’t tolerate things we feel are unacceptable, so there’s not a great deal of change. They’re all going to be treated as individuals and as men.’

Poyet had watched every Sunderland game after Di Canio’s departure. He saw a change in body language and commitment and was impressed by Ball’s obvious influence. His first meeting after being appointed was with his Under 21 coach.

Ball’s disciplinary changes merely needed tweaking, leaving Poyet, coaches Mauricio Taricco, Charlie Oatway, goalkeeping coach Andy Beasley and fitness coach Antonio Pintus to concentrate on making a real difference on the training ground.

One player who has benefited from Poyet’s calm hands-on approach is Adam Johnson, now back in the form of his life and on the fringe of the England squad.

‘It was just like having a chat with one of my friends talking about football,’ the winger said. ‘That’s the type of guy he is. That’s why we’re benefiting.

‘It was more just having a chat with me to see how I was. I don’t think it was really, “You’ve got to do this, you’ve got to do that”. He just wanted me to play with  freedom and confidence. Fans at every club I’ve been at have loved me. It’s more the managers having the trust in me playing.

‘I just wanted to play and have a manager who had trust in me. The gaffer came in, tweaked the way we’re playing so I get the ball a bit more and it seems to work.’

The major achievement of Poyet’s reign at Sunderland was the dramatic penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the semi-finals.

Triumph over City on Sunday would elevate Poyet to the same status as Bob Stokoe — and end the club’s 41 years of hurt.
