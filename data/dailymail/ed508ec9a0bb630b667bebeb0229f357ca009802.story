An 18-year-old freshman who was shot dead outside his friend's party may have been trying to break up a fight, it has been revealed.

Reginald Terry, a gifted footballer, died after he was gunned down in the street in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.

He had stepped outside the house where the party was being held when he was shot at around 1.15am.

Now, Mr Terry's friends and coaches have said he may have been trying to break up a fight between partygoers when he was killed.

Meanwhile, officials have agreed that an 'altercation' likely took place outside the event in Hasley Street, according to nj.com.

Football coach Christ Stromolo described the New Jersey City University student as a gifted athlete and a positive role model for younger players.

'He was one of the last kids you'd expect to be killed on the 
street,' said Mr Stromolo, assistant coach at Central High School, where Mr Terry used to play as a fullback.

'He was a positive kid and a kid who made a difference. He was 
all heart.'

Head coach Julius Montford added: 'Reggie was such a leader with his demeanor, work ethic and smile.

'He touched a lot of lives without even knowing he touched those lives.'

Mr Terry - who also represented the university's bowling team - was shot near the intersection of Washington street and Market 
street - just metres away from his friend's party.

Police are yet to make any arrests, but 
investigators are looking into the possibility that the freshman was not
 the shooter's target, according to Kathy Carter of Essex County 
Prosecutor's Office.

In a personal statement on a college recruiting website, Mr Terry had previously described football as his escape - adding: 'I 
choose to look at myself in the mirror and say "I will not be like 
everyone else" and choose my own destiny to be successful.'

Mr Terry was not the only person to be shot dead in Newark on Saturday.

Altariq Kornegay, 21, died after being shot multiple times in Avon Avenue at around 9pm.

He was taken to University Hospital, but was sadly pronounced dead at 9.45pm.

The Essex County Sheriff's CrimeStoppers scheme has offered a $15,000 (Â£9,174) reward for information leading to an arrest in connection with both killings, said Ms Carter.
