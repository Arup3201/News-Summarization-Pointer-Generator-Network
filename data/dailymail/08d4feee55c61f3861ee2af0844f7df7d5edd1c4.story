A nude model arrested last year in Times Square won a handsome settlement from city officials.

Zoe West, 22, was taken into custody last August after stripping down to naught but body paint, handcuffs, and a wry smile.

The model had been carefully painted by famed local body painter Andy Golub in a stunt that drew onlookers ranging from shocked tourists to bemused office workers.

Her attorney, Ron Kuby, told the New York Post: ‘The beauty of New York City is a naked girl can win a nice suit.’

Mr Kuby said that Ms West plans to settle her case against the city today, to the tune of $15,000.

Ms West told the Post that she holds 
no ill-will to New York’s finest, saying the false arrest ‘put me on the
map in a positive way.’

The model, who is on Model Mayhem, a 
social networking site for models and artists, wrote that she is only 
interested in ‘tasteful, artfully done nude work.’

Likewise, Mr Golub deemed her settlement as a ‘fair’ according to the Post.

But not everyone had enjoyed the spectacle.

On the evening of the body painting last year, several NYPD officers showed up and took the woman into custody, binding her with handcuffs and hauling her off in a police van.

Ms West said there was nothing against the law about her modelling.

She told the New York Post last year: 'I don't believe there is truly anything wrong with what I did and with what he was doing.'

Ms West, whose ModelMayhem.com profile promises she would do 'NO EROTIC NUDE WORK EVER,' said the charges were later dropped.

Mr Golub is no stranger to gawkers in Times Square either, as he’s been there to perform his art several times over the last few years.

He was charged with public lewdness in a similar stunt last month with two other models.

The 45-year-old told the Post that Miss West was aware of the risks and posed for him anyway.He said: 'I explained all this to my model, so she was completely aware.'
