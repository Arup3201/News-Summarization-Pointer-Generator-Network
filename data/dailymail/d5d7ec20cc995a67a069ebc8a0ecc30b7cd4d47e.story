Missing: Kyron Horman holding a teddy bear before he mysteriously vanished in 2010

The divorced parents of a 10-year-old boy who went missing in 2010 have appeared on television together for the first time in three years.

Dr Phil dedicated the hour-long programme to an interview between Desiree Young and Kaine Horman, whose son Kyron Horman mysteriously vanished from his school.

They questioned each other over events which led up to disappearance of the boy, who was seven years old when he failed to arrive at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon.

The boy's mother accused Horman, his father,  of ignoring signs he was unhappy. But Horman said Kyron was struggling to deal with 'split households'

Young said: 'I don't blame Kaine for Kyron's disappearance. I want to make that very clear.'

But she added: 'Things were happening in the year prior to Kyron going missing.

'It was just ignored. I feel like in that we failed Kyron. We didn't protect him.'

Kyron's mother also said she had concerns Horman was 'ignoring signs', referring to the behavior of his wife, Terri Horman, Kyron Horman's stepmother, who took him to school on the day he disappeared. 

Desiree Young filed a $10 million suit against Terri Horman last year, alleging the stepmother kidnapped Kyron Horman.

But the case was dropped, with Young saying it could not move forward without information from the police, who withheld evidence because of the ongoing investigation.

Kyron was reported missing in June 2010 after failing to turn up to Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon.

He was taken to school by his stepmother, Terri Horman, who then stayed with him while he attended a science fair.

Terri Horman states she left the school at around 8:45am but Kyron was not present in his first class of the day and was marked down as absent.

Three years on, no arrests have been made in the case, despite an exhaustive search by local police and the FBI.

During the interview Young also talked about Horman's infidelity while they were married, saying: 'I was seven months pregnant, Kaine was having an affair.'

Horman apologised for cheating on her with Terri Horman, who he married around six months after Kyron's disappearance. 

Allegations: Desiree Young also talked about Horman's infidelity, accusing him of having an affair when they were married and when she was pregnant with Kyron

Horman, did not respond to the allegations, focusing on Kyron throughout the conversation.

He said the seven-year-old acted out while he switched between Horman's house in Portland and Young's in Medford which is 273 miles away. 

Young said Terri Horman would call her, asking if she could come and collect Kyron when the boy's father was away on business trips.

She recalled one time when she came to pick him up and said 'He was crying. There was something going on. He wanted to live with me. He didn't want to be there.'

Horman reacted and said the reason Kyron was upset was because he was just struggling to 'deal with split households' and said he also cried during journeys to Medford.

Play: Dr Phil's audience were shown clips of Kyron before he disappeared, including this one of him playing with his mother

Desiree Young filed a $10million lawsuit against Kyron's stepmother Terri Horman, accusing her of kidnap, but she dropped the case in July this year

'He didn’t want to come see you. I never told you that before.'

Both Horman and Young repeated believe that Terri Horman is implicated in Kyron's disappearance.

She took him to Skyline School that Friday morning and she is the last known person who saw him.

'I believe she's involved in this. I think she is the one who has all the answers.'

A cloud of suspicion has hung over Terri Horman, who is now living with her parents in Roseburg. But she's not been charged and was only named as a prime suspect in a civil law suit filed against her.

Young said Terri Horman had put everything in writing, saying she and Kaine Horman had been up arguing until 3 a.m, just hours before Kyron disappeared.

Young said Terri Horman wrote that her marriage to Kaine Horman was over and that she planned to return to Roseburg the day the boy vanished.

No stone unturned: Authorities have searched more than 28,000 hours for Kyron since his 2010 disappearance. Here, recovery workers take to the water

Volunteers: Desiree Young organised a new search earlier this month and said she had unearthered new evidence

Kaine Horman denied the allegations saying they did not fight at all.

Multiple searches have been done but the authorities have never turned up any solid indications of what happened to the boy.

Both Young and Horman said they believe he is alive somewhere.

'I will until the day that I die. I still believe that he's going to come through the door.'

Horman said he thinks the fact that no clues have turned up only increases the likelihood that Kyron lives.

Earlier this month, Young organised a new search in Multnomah County, Oregon, and said that she had unearthed new evidence.

She said that the two-day search, which was carried out by 60 volunteers, and 10 search dogs, was successful but she would not be specific about exactly what they found, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

The items were handed over to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office and officers were examining  whether they hold any significance to the case.

Hope: Desiree Young (picture with Kyron) said she still believes her son is going to walk through her door alive
