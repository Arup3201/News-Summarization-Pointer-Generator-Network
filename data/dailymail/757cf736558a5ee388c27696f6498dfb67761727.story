A fishing boat, a football and even a Harley Davidson motorcycle have been sifted from the debris that has continued to wash up on the shores of the western United States more than a year on from the devastating Japanese tsunami.

But one Japanese man hoping his own lost property will be recovered over 4,000 miles away on an American beach could be being a tad optimistic.

The 77-year-old has written to the mayor of a small city in Washington, U.S., asking him to keep his eyes peeled for his missing library cards.

Debris: This 70ft dock washed ashore on a beach in Oregon - the largest item in the stream of debris that has ended up on U.S. shores after the Japanese tsunami

Bill Simpson, mayor of Aberdeen, Washington, received a postcard from a Mr Saito inquiring whether he had been 'observing the floating materials'.

'The man felt compelled to write us, looking for what he lost,' Mr Simpson told local newspaper theÂ Daily World.

Surprise: Bill Simpson, the Mayor of Aberdeen, Washington, received the postcard from a hopeful Japanese man

The neatly written postcard, addressed to the mayor's office in Aberdeen, explained that the writer had lost his 'collected surveyed amounts library cards'.

The man, who hails from Japan's Sapporo ward, wrote: 'To your seashore areas, have you been observing the floated materials?'

The 77-year-old said he had read about how 'lost packaged tools/house woods are arriving to the USA's Pacific Ocean seashores'.

'If you find some, please let me know any news,' he wrote, adding: 'I don't use any electric tools now here, so please, to me by air letter!'

Mr Simpson said he initially thought the postcard, which cost 70 yen, was a joke.

'But, then I got to think about it, and I think it's real,' he said.

A year and a half after the 
devastating wave hit Japan in March 2011, a continuing stream of 
detritus from destroyed Japanese communities has been washing up on the 
shores of Washington, Alaska, Oregon, and parts of Canada.

Around
1.5 million tons of debris is expected to reach the U.S. as a result of
the tsunami, which was triggered by an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean 
off Japan on March 11, 2011.

Experts say it could be another two years before the dregs of the disaster cease to be spat out on to U.S. beaches.

And the delayed impact the destructive wave is having on the western U.S. is fast becoming an economic catastrophe for the region.

Coastal states, already feeling the effects of severe budget cuts in the wake of the financial crisis, are having their finances strained even further by the pressing need to fund the clean-up of their beaches - which could cost up to $200million.

A 70ft metal dock washed up on a 
beach in Oregon earlier this month, while a Harley Davidson motorcycle 
ended up on Canadian shores after an epic journey across the ocean.

A
football recovered on Middleton Island, around 70 miles from mainland 
Alaska, was eventually traced back to a school in a tsunami-hit area of 
Japan.

As western states 
struggle to cope with the clean-up, Alaskan senator Mark Begich has 
introduced a bill which would earmark $45 million in federal aid to help
cover the costs, arguing that the emergency should be considered on a 
par with an earthquake or a tornado.

But federal officials have previously said that no additional money will be made available.

Trash: 1.5million tons of debris is though to have been swept off the coast of Japan in last year's tsunami

Danger: A damaged fishing boat had to be destroyed when it was found floating off the coast of Alaska
