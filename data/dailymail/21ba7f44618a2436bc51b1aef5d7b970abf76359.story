Boston 
Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did not seem nervous or 
agitated in the days after the deadly attack and slept soundly, his 
former college roommate testified Tuesday during the trial of a Tsarnaev
 friend accused of obstructing the investigation.

In
 the few days after the April 2013 bombing, Andrew Dwinells said, 
Tsarnaev spent much of his time the same way he always did: sleeping, 
texting and going on his computer.

'He slept a little bit more, but that was it,' Dwinells said.

Dwinells'
 testimony came during the trial of Azamat Tazhayakov, who is accused 
with another friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, of removing items from Tsarnaev's 
University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room three days after the 
bombings and hours after the FBI posted video and photos of Tsarnaev as a
 suspect.

In this courtroom sketch, defendant Azamat Tazhayakov, left, a college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is depicted listening to testimony by FBI Special Agent Phil Christiana, right, during the first day of his federal obstruction of justice trial Monday, July 7, 2014 in Boston

Also on Tuesday, FBI agent Sarah Wood said on the stand in US District Court in Boston that the two college friends jointly decided they should throw out a backpack with fireworks after learning that Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, had been killed in a shootout with police days after the bombing, according to the Boston Globe.

His
 description of Tsarnaev's behavior after the bombings was elicited by 
Tazhayakov's attorneys during cross-examination and appeared designed to
 underscore the defense's contention that none of the people who knew 
Tsarnaev - including Tazhayakov - had any idea that Tsarnaev was a 
suspect in the bombings until after the FBI released his photo.

During
 questioning by prosecutors, Dwinells said he and Tsarnaev shared a room
 but didn't talk much and never socialized together.

Dwinells
 described the night of April 18, 2013, when prosecutors say Tazhayakov,
 Kadyrbayev and another friend went to Tsarnaev's dorm room after 
Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev and said they could 'take what's there.'

Dwinells said a man he later learned was Kadyrbayev 'said he needed to get into the room to get something.'

After
 getting a small bag of marijuana out of a desk drawer, Kadyrbayev 
continued to look around the room for another 10 minutes, but Dwinells 
said he did not see any other items being taken.

Dwinells said the other men - Tazhayakov and Robel Phillipos - sat down and watched TV while Kadyrbayev searched the room.

Prosecutors
 contend that Tazhayakov agreed with Kadyrbayev's plan to take a 
backpack containing altered fireworks and to throw away the items to 
protect Tsarnaev.

Tazhayakov's
 lawyers insist that he sat passively in the dorm room while Kadyrbayev 
took the backpack and did not participate in the decision to throw it 
away.

Two bombs placed near the marathon finish line killed three people and injured more than 260.

In
 other testimony Tuesday, an FBI agent said Tazhayakov initially denied 
knowing what was in Tsarnaev's backpack but eventually said he saw 
fireworks that appeared to have been emptied of powder.

Agent Sara Wood said he told her he said 'I agree' when Kadyrbayev suggested throwing away the backpack.

During
 cross-examination by Tazhayakov's lawyer, Wood acknowledged that 
Tazhayakov told her it was Kadyrbayev who actually took the backpack and
 threw it away.

Tsarnaev is awaiting trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Authorities say he and his older brother, Tamerlan, planted the bombs made from pressure cookers.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a shootout with police several days after the bombings.
