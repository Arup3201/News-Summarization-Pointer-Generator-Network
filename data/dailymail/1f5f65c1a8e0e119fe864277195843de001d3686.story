When Nouha Dicko clambered off the bench at the break, he clearly had a point to prove. Not starting for the first time in the league this season, the young striker was the driving force behind Wolves coming away from the Valley with a point.

Kenny Jackett’s side struggled with the intensity of the hosts - drilled by the charismatic Bob Peeters - until the 22-year-old’s half-time inclusion.

Dicko was pushed up alongside lone target man Leon Clarke - his pace frightening Charlton and tenacity yielding the corner from which Danny Batth equalised after Andre Bikey’s 25th minute opener.

The Addicks were rattled by Dicko’s ability to run in behind and Wanderers went back to the Midlands with more than had earlier looked likely.

Talking of the change, Jackett said: ‘It really helped us. Dicko gave us a little bit of pace in behind their back four. We tried to get him in the game and it raised the fans.

‘I am disappointed for the players, they played very well. There was a great tempo to us. There is promise going forward and their goalkeeper has made three fantastic saves.’

Peeters, on the other hand, has already galvanised Charlton and they sat top of the Championship for a portion of the night. They press high and attempt to force mistakes in front of vociferous support.

It does mean the football is helter-skelter at times, but they are being entertained on a weekly basis. Results have been consistently positive and there is a manager who is changing the club’s ethos. August’s mantra of mere survival will not do.

‘Every time we broke I felt we could score,’ Peeters said. ‘They brought on Dicko and he caused us a lot of problems.’

It had looked very promising indeed earlier. Igor Vetokole - a revelation since joining from FC Copenhagen - won himself a corner he had no right to, with Jordan Cousins’ resulting centre helped beyond Carl Ikeme at his near post by Bikey. The trademark somersaults ensued, and they should have been celebrating again seconds later.

Almost straight from the kick-off, Vetokole - who trapped a nerve in his arm late on and has been assessed by club doctors - picked Lee Evans’ pocket in midfield before sliding in George Tucudean, but the Romanian skewed his shot wide. It was a very presentable opportunity and one in which he ought to have finished, much like earlier in the half when the striker could only send a free header wide from eight yards.

They were almost made to pay for those misses by George Saville, but the Wolves midfielder could only find Stephen Henderson’s right-hand post from the edge of the box. It served as a warning sign for the Addicks, who saw Evans twice flash long-range efforts just wide.

Wolves passed the ball competently but lacked real endeavour in the final third. Saville, Evans and Kevin McDonald are imposing in midfield but weren’t able to manufacture the ball wide to James Henry or Bakary Sako nearly enough.

They improved significantly after the inclusion of Dicko. Clarke twice swept efforts wide before Sako’s fierce strike was brilliantly tipped over by Henderson.

Jackett’s switch at the break had worked, if only Clarke could find the net. He again couldn’t hit the target, this time missing his kick after Dicko’s intelligent pullback.

But the equaliser wasn’t far away and it was all down to Dicko’s tireless work. He chased down a lost cause, winning a corner, and central defender Danny Batth bundled home. The healthy travelling contingent in the Jimmy Seed Stand went wild, and it was just reward for their team’s efforts after the break.

The manager looked fired up on the touchline, so too his players. James Henry rattled a post and they weren’t able to force a winner - even when Dicko was put clear in the stoppage time. On this basis, neither side will fall away from their lofty Championship positions anytime soon.
