Charged: Maria Espinoza-Perez was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday after police officers found her 3-year-old daughter dead at the family home on Sunday

A 3-year-old girl was discovered beaten to death at her family's Chicago home over the weekend and police believe the toddler's 24-year-old mother is to blame.

Maria Espinoza-Perez wore sandals, jeans and a black t-shirt as she appeared in bond court Wednesday morning after being charged with first-degree murder. 

Espinoza-Perez listened through a Spanish interpreter as the judge ordered her held without bail considering the 'horrific allegations' she brutally murdered her toddler-daughter Ashley Mendoza.

Ashley was in good health when her father, Espinoza-Perez's boyfriend, left work work on Sunday at 12:45pm.

The little girl spent all day with her mother before Espinoza-Perez called her boyfriend at 8pm to say someone had broken into the house and their daughter wasn't breathing.

Twenty minutes later, Espinoza-Perez called police to report that two men had broken into her home and injured her daughter before fleeing.

When police showed up, they found the toddler dead on the kitchen floor with injuries on her forehead, bruising on her hands and legs, scrapes and abrasions on her neck, missing teeth and 'possible fractures to several bones'.

No blood was found on Ashley or in the kitchen, but investigators found blood spatters in the bathroom and in the girl's bedroom  - even on her stuffed teddy bear.

There were no signs of a break-in.

The Cook County Medical Examiners Office reported that Ashley died from injuries sustained from child abuse and her death was ruled a homicide.

After her arrest, Espinoza-Perez admitted in videotaped statements that she made up some parts of the home invation and cleaned up Ashley's blood after causing one of the injuries. She said she alone caused the girl's injuries and had been abusing her daughter for years.

The 
Department of Child and Family Services say they are investigating 
allegations of child abuse against Espinoza-Perez, but that they had no 
prior reports on the family. 

They had lived in the apartment for about three years.

However, neighbor Anita Padilla says the family was often loud and so noisy that they would shake the walls.

'There was a lot of yelling, but it was mostly between the husband and wife,' Ms Padilla told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Ms Padilla says the arguments were in Spanish so she never understood what the couple was fighting about, but that police never showed up before.

She says the father of the toddler seemed to be a good dad.

'When he would leave every day (for work), she would stand by the window, and he would stand by the car blowing kisses and giving air hugs,' Ms Padilla said.

But fellow-neighbor Steven Kispetik told WLS that the couple were peaceful.

'They're a very quiet couple. THey never interfere with anything, you know? I have no explanation,' Mr Kispetik said.
