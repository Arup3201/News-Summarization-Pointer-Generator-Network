There's no beating around the bush, this baby cockatoo was born ugly.

With its patchy black and white feathers barely covering its fleshy pink skin, and a beak that looks too big for its body, it could look better.

But despite that it was the subject of fascination today as it was presented at Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic.

A baby of palm cockatoos, also known as the Goliath Cockatoo, is presented at the Zoo in Prague, Czech Republic

The chick is the child of palm cockatoos, also known as the Goliath Cockatoo, is believed to be the first born in Europe since 2010.

It came into the world on October 1 and remains nameless until the gender is known.

And when it grows up, it will eventually spread its wings as a beautiful large smoky-grey or black bird.

In the wild, this species, the largest of all parrots, is normally found in Australia and New Guinea.

It can live in most habitats, but is mostly seen in lowland areas and foothills, but occasionally they are seen in heights up to 1,350m above sea level.

They choose large trees for nesting and roosting and mainly eat leaf buds, seeds, and fruits.
