Earnings: Convicted paedophile Ian Watkins will earn £147,497 in assets after Lostprophets disband and more than £100,000 in royalties

Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins will earn more than £150,000 while serving a 29-year jail sentence for child sex offences.

The singer's conviction forced his former band, the Lostprophets, to break up - and distribute their assets worth more than £700,000, it has been revealed.

Watkins, who is currently jailed in top-security Wakefield prison, is contracted to take £147,497 in the deal.

And music experts claim the convicted molesterer will earn more than £100,000 in royalties during his sentence.

The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty to three counts of child sexual assault at a trial in Cardiff Crown Court last month.

But today it emerged Goonies Touring Company, which handles Lostprophets' finances, will distribute the earnings, as instructed by the other four members.

A source told the Daily Star Sunday: 'Watkins is entitled to the money because it is cash earned by the band before this scandal.

'It is not money earned from criminal enterprises so it can't be confiscated by the state.'

Music lawyer Craig Brookes explained that as the band's lyricist, Watkins will be in line for a big cut of any fees generated.

'The biggest income stream will almost certainly be publishing which, even if radio play has stopped, will still be pretty big,' he told Wales on Sunday.

'This is because PRS and their equivalents in different countries allocate money on a spot-check basis.

'So you're going to get money for plays in gyms and hairdressers and on juke boxes and all that stuff.

The group split up following Watkins' (second right) arrest. The other members have attacked his actions, saying they all feel 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted'

'They will say, "This is how much music is in the market place so it is likely you are due this amount."'

Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

His former bandmates have turned their back on him - saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his sex crimes and have urged more of his victims to contact police.
