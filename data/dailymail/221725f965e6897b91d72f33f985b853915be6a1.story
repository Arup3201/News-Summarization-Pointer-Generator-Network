An Ohio inmate put to death for murder was tortured by his unusually slow execution, the man's daughter said on Friday, as she announced plans to file a lawsuit over her father's death.

Dennis McGuire's daughter, Amber, referred to the 'agony and terror' of watching her father as he appeared to gasp in his final moments on Thursday, during a previously untried execution method.

'It was the most awful moment in my life to witness my dad's execution,' she said. 'I can't think of any other way to describe it than torture.' Ohio could face a number of legal challenges over the method.

The execution violated Dennis 
McGuire's constitutional right not to be treated or punished in a cruel 
or unusual way, said defense attorney Jon Paul Rion, representing 
McGuire's adult children.

McGuire's attorney Allen Bohnert called the killer's death 'a failed, agonizing experiment.' He added: 'The people of the state of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in their names.'

McGuire, 53, was put to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of a pregnant newlywed, Joy Stewart.

He made loud snorting noises 
during one of the longest executions since Ohio resumed capital 
punishment in 1999.

Nearly 25 minutes passed between the time the lethal
 drugs began flowing and McGuire was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m.

This is the longest execution in Ohio since the state resumed capital punishment 15 years ago, records show.

The next-longest execution was the 22 minutes it took killer Reginald Brooks to die in 2011, according to an AP analysis of the timelines of the 53 Ohio executions since 1999.

Brooks received a lethal dose of a different drug.

During the execution he opened and shut his hands as if waving to his son, 
daughter and daughter-in-law sitting a few feet away and a full minute 
later he stood up and told them, 'I love you, I love you.'

Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method

Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death

Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections.

Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s.Â 

The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties.

Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine.

An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath.

The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations.

Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred.

As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution.

McGuire was then still for five minutes before 
emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for
 several minutes.

His stomach rose and fell several times as 
he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth, making what the Columbus Dispatch described as 'deep, rattling sounds.'

His family sobbed as they watched him slowly die. 'Oh, my God,' Amber McGuire, said as she watched his final moments.

A
 coughing sound was Dennis McGuire's last apparent movement, at 10:43 
a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. McGuire as first injected 
with the drugs at 10:29 a.m.

The convicted murderer's attorneys had 
argued against using intravenous doses
 of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone, claiming 
the combination would cause 'air hunger.'

This medical phenomenon describes where someone experiences 
immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution.

The new method was adopted after supplies of
 a previously used drug dried up because the manufacturer declared it 
off limits for capital punishment.

McGuire's
 snorts and gasps, and prolonged death, suggest he may have indeed 
suffered 'air hunger' and could prompt Ohio officials to 
review using the drug cocktail.

Executions under the old method were typically much shorter and did not cause the kind of sounds McGuire made.

What was particularly unusual Thursday 
was the five minutes or so that McGuire lay motionless on the gurney 
after the drugs began flowing, followed by a sudden snort and then more 
than 10 minutes of irregular breathing and gasping.

Normally, movement 
comes at the beginning and is followed by inactivity.

It's
 almost certain lawyers will use McGuire's execution to challenge Ohio's
 plans to put a condemned Cleveland-area killer to death in March.

A
 few minutes before McGuire was put to death, Ohio prison director Gary 
Mohr said he believed the state's planning would produce 'a humane, 
dignified execution' consistent with the law.

Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant

Ohio prisons spokeswoman JoEllen Smith had no comment on how the execution went but said a review will be conducted as usual.

McGuire's
 attorney called on Republican Gov. John Kasich to impose a moratorium 
on future executions, as did a state death penalty opponent group.

The
 move will likely echo across the country as other states contemplate 
new drug methods, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death 
Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.

'Judges
 will now realize that the warnings being raised about these untried 
procedures are not just false alarms,' he said in an email.

'States will now have more of a burden to show that they are using a well thought out best practice. '

In
 pressing for the execution to go ahead, state Assistant Attorney 
General Thomas Madden had argued that while the U.S. Constitution bans 
cruel and unusual punishment, 'you're not entitled to a pain-free 
execution.'

U.S. District 
Judge Gregory Frost sided with the state. But at the request of 
McGuire's lawyers, he ordered officials to photograph and preserve the 
drug vials, packaging and syringes.

McGuire,
 strapped to a gurney in the death chamber, thanked Stewart's family 
members, who witnessed the execution, for their 'kind words' in a letter
 he apparently received from them.

Tragic: In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life

'I'm going to heaven. I'll see you there when you come,' he said.

Stewart's
 slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an 
unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told 
investigators he had information about the death.

His attempts to pin the crime on his brother-in-law quickly unraveled, and he was accused of the killing.

More
 than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he 
acknowledged his responsibility in a letter to Kasich last month.

The
 death row inmate's lawyers argued McGuire was mentally, physically and 
sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him
 prone to act impulsively.

'We
 have forgiven him, but that does not negate the need for him to pay for
 his actions,' Stewart's family said in a statement after the execution.
