A thrill-seeker has become the first person to be fined for 'tombstoning' off a notorious bridge where a 22-year-old died last year.

Michael Sharkey, 24, was spotted jumping several times from the 30ft-high Devil’s Bridge in Cumbria.

He was fined £170 after admitting breaching a local bylaw, and officers said his prosecution was the first of its kind in the county.

It is the same spot where Darrell Teal, 22, of Manchester, died in July last year.

Taking action: A court in Cumbria has issued its first fine to a tombstoner who was repeatedly jumping from a bridge where a young man died last year

Devil’s Bridge is notoriously dangerous because there is only a small area of deep water to jump in to from the bridge in Kirkby Lonsdale.

The 14th Century bridge has been used for decades by people ‘tombstoning’ into the River Lune, but after several injuries over the years, signs have been erected warning people not to.

Fatal spot: It is the same spot where Darrell Teal, 22, of Manchester, died in July last year

Police said that the hot summer this year had led to an increase in people jumping, despite Mr Teal’s death last year.

Sharkey, of Gressingham Drive, Lancaster, was fined after pleading guilty at Kendal Magistrates’ Court for the offence.

Two other men, both from Rossendale, Lancashire (aged 24 and 33), are also in the process of being prosecuted.

Inspector Paul Latham said: 'It is simply crass stupidity to jump from Devil’s Bridge.

'There are a number of risks associated with jumping off a bridge including hitting rocks, misjudging the depth of water and sudden immersion in cold water.

'This prosecution is the first one I am aware of and certainly the first one in relation to Devil’s Bridge.

'We have actually seen an increase in people jumping this year, because of the hot weather.'

He said that Sharkey was prosecuted when a local councillor spotted him repeatedly jumping from the bridge in August.

The police were called and Sharkey was pointed out to officers. He was issued with a court summons and pleaded guilty to breaching the bylaw.

Inspector Latham said: 'There is a problem at the bridge because thrill seekers say that you should be able to do what you want and that the police are being party-poopers.

'But it is very dangerous to jump there. We have to think of the consequences and the impact that jumping has had on the family of the man who died there last year.

Devil's Bridge has been a popular tombstoning spot for decades

Taking action: After numerous incidents, the local council put up signs banning people from jumping off the bridge in line with a byelaw

'This fine shows we do take this 
activity very seriously, and work closely with South Lakeland District 
Council to tackle the dangers. If someone jumping is reported to us we 
will attend and take further action as appropriate.

'However,
the responsibility for keeping each other safe falls on the entire 
community. Police cannot be there all the time and we encourage members 
of the public to either report anyone seen jumping, or to speak to them 
and advise them of the risks in jumping.

'There is also personal responsibility people need to take to protect their own health and safety. It is an incredibly dangerous activity and I would ask anyone who is considering jumping to think about the risks and effects it will have on family should anything untoward happen.

The warning hasn't prevented thrill-seekers from continuing to launch themselves from the bridge into the river where they must aim for a small deeper channel

During the hot summer, the adrenaline-pumping past-time has attracted young thrill-seekers and spectators to the river

'Jumping from the bridge is particularly common during the summer months, and we will continue to work with the local community next summer to reiterate the dangers.'

John Barwise, Neighbourhood Enforcement Officer for South Lakeland District Council, said: 'The fine imposed on the male who contravened the SLDC byelaw that prohibits jumping off Devil’s Bridge into the River Lune was a direct result of a joint enforcement operation carried out by SLDC`s Enforcement Team and Cumbria Police during the summer of 2013.

'The prosecution sends out a clear message that SLDC and Cumbria Police will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of members of the public who contravene the byelaw and risk death or serious injury by jumping off the bridge.'

Tombstoning is also popular among youngsters in Plymouth

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police told the Mail Online he was not aware of any fines issued for tombstoning, and officers would advise against it as opposed to prosecute

A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'Jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous.

'What was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by tea-time due to tidal conditions - and you don't know what other hazards might be under the surface.'

In the past eight years, this perilous pursuit has claimed the lives of 20 people and left more than 60 seriously injured, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

These figures include two suspected tombstoning incidents last year, where Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping into the River Lune from the 40ft-high Devil’s Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria.

A few days later 15-year-old Daniel McCullagh drowned after he was swept away by strong currents as him as his friends tombstoned off a 20ft-high bridge over the River Nene at Woodford Lock near Kettering, Northamptonshire.

This year there have not been any deaths from tombstoning, but there have so far been three reported injuries to date.

In the last eight years there have been 74 reported injuries from tombstoning, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

2007 claimed the most lives to tombstoning within this period, with six people dying doing the sport.
