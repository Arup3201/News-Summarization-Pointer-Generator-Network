As many as 1.5million people are working from home during the Olympics in what experts warned could prove a damaging blow to the capital’s economy.

Thousands of civil servants who would normally be at their desks in Whitehall have taken advantage of an offer of ‘flexible working’ while the Games are on.

And many big blue-chip firms, including the taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have allowed staff to stay away from their offices following apocalyptic warnings of travel chaos.

Trade hits rock bottom: Small businesses and sole traders vent their anger after messages to stay away from the capital have led to a slump in takings during the Games

Now that it is clear the transport 
network is coping with Games visitors, there are calls for both the 
public and private sector to rethink ‘work from home’ policies.

Retailers
are warning that key parts of London have been turned into ‘ghost 
towns’ as workers who would normally be buying lunches, taking taxis, 
doing some lunchtime shopping or having an after-work drink stay away.

Economists
said many staff would be less productive while working from home – 
particularly with the temptation of the Games on TV.

More
than half of employers are making changes to their working practices 
during the Olympics to enable staff to work more flexibly or to allow 
them to watch key events at work, according to the Chartered Institute 
of Personnel and Development.

Almost three in ten employers are accommodating requests by staff to work from home. Some 17 per cent said they were extending flexible working opportunities, allowing staff to vary hours, while 13 per cent are actively encouraging staff to work from home.

The London Chamber of Commerce estimated that 1.5million of the 5million people who work in London will work from home at some point over the next two weeks.

Chief executive Colin Stanbridge said: ‘Eighty per cent of companies offer some form of remote working, and I think up to a million and a half employees will take advantage of that at this special time.’

An estimated 800 Ministry of Justice staff are working from home, while around 400 London-based Department for Work and Pensions staff have relocated to offices outside the capital.

In total, more than 4,000 civil servants normally working in London – around six per cent of the total – are thought to have taken advantage of the offer to work from home.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Indications are that less than six per cent of civil servants are working from home and that many more are choosing to do their bit by adapting their commute, with some changing their choice of transport or route and others the times at which they travel.’

Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, revealed that 40 per cent of its 8,500 staff based in Canary Wharf are working from home – 3,400 individuals.

The bank said it was acting on the advice of Transport for London and the Olympics Committee to reduce congestion at some of London’s key Tube stations during the Games.

A spokesman rejected claims that staff will be tempted to slack off.

He said: ‘People work harder from home. Lots of our staff have a one and a half hour journey to and from work.’

Other firms and institutions to have let workers avoid the chaos that has failed to materialise include the Bank of England, BP and British Gas.

Worrying: Restaurants in Covent Garden, normally rammed with tourists, are suffering a downturn in trade as customers stay away from the area

Barely a soul in sight: This was the scene at London Bridge earlier this week. Many workers have been given the option of working from home during the Olympics

Workers on the Woolwich Ferry are the latest transport staff to receive a lucrative bonus simply for doing their job during the Olympics.

The Unite union said all 106 workers on the service, which operates between Woolwich and North Woolwich, will get ‘at least £400’. They will also get a better overtime rate on particularly busy days which will be worth double their standard hourly pay. 

It is the latest in a long line of Olympic windfalls worth up to £1,100 for transport workers in the capital.

Lloyds, one of the main Olympics 
sponsors, said some of its staff are working from home. The state-backed
bank said this includes ‘non-customer facing’ staff who have to commute
from outside the capital.

Hundreds of staff at taxpayer-owned RBS are also expected to work from home and the Bank of England confirmed some staff are also doing so.

Drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, based in West London, said staff have been encouraged to work from home. However, analysts warn that many staff will be less productive than if they were in the office.

George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The risk is that you can’t or don’t do as much from home, so while people may report similar hours worked their output – and therefore productivity – will be lower.’ Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said: ‘The TV coverage of the Olympics will presumably be a big distraction.’

Pierre Williams, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘A lot of small businesses are feeling very hard pressed: not only are they facing the ongoing recession, declining consumer confidence and demand, they are now seeing the expansion of working from home in the public sector.’ 

Rebecca Clake of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: ‘Employers should communicate very clearly what their policy is, for example, whether employees are allowed to keep track of the Games online or whether they take a zero-tolerance approach.’

Despite the concerns of business 
chiefs, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said today that having the Olympic
Games in London is 'the best possible gift you could ask for' if you 
run a tourism business.

The cabinet minister said people 
needed to take a longer-term view after claims that the 2012 Games have 
turned the capital into a 'ghost town', with commuters and non-Olympic 
tourists avoiding the city.

After figures showed that footfall in 
the theatreland and shopping focal point of the West End was down almost
5 per cent and mayor Boris Johnson admitted that the Games were having a 'patchy' effect on some businesses, Mr Hunt told ITV’s Daybreak that the
Olympics had given the city a global 'cachet' that would boost 
long-term tourism.

'I think we have to take a slightly 
longer-term view on this - if you have a business in London, 
particularly a tourism business - a theatre or restaurant or hotel - 
then having the Olympics in London is the best possible gift you could 
ask for because that has given London a profile on a global stage,' he 
said.

'London is already a well-known city, 
it has become absolutely iconic because of these Games and that opening 
ceremony has given London a cachet that makes people really want to be 
here and come here.

'We have a plan to get four million 
additional tourists here over the next four years. It may be a bit up 
and down over the next few weeks but it is going to be terrific for 
London businesses.'

Meanwhile, it was announced today that Westfield Stratford City shopping mall, the gateway to London’s Olympic Park, will be shut at the weekend to people without tickets for the Games to try to manage the crowds.

The centre’s stores will still be open to ticket holders but regular shoppers will be turned away between 9.30am and 4pm on Friday and Saturday, the Australian developer.

'We’ve always been working with the Games organisers on crowd management plan for the Olympic Park so it’s always been one option,' a Westfield spokeswoman said. 'We still expect it to be busier than our non-Olympic trading days.'

Tomorrow and Saturday are expected to be the Olympic Park’s busiest days when the Olympic Stadium opens up for athletic events. Up to 80,000 more spectators are expected to travel to and from the Olympic Park on Friday alone. 

The centre, Europe’s biggest urban shopping mall, will be reopened to all visitors outside these hours, Westfield said. It will also be open as normal on Sunday.

Westfield does not disclose footfall numbers but the 1.9 million square foot shopping centre, which opened in September last year, is expected to be one of the big winners from the Olympics due to its proximity to the main venues.
