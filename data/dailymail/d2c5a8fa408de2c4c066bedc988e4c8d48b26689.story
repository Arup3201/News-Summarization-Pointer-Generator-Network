Big pay out: Former Kent County Council chief Katherine Kerswell got a £589,165 pay off from 
Kent County Council

A council chief who lasted just 20 months in her job was given a £589,165 pay-off, the local authority has been forced to admit.

Katherine Kerswell left Kent County Council in December.

The council had refused to disclose 
details of the settlement, saying it was subject to a confidentiality 
agreement. But it was forced to declare the sum under new transparency 
rules on executive pay.

Its Conservative administration 
insisted at the time that her departure was part of a cost-saving 
reorganisation. 
But there was also speculation she had fallen out with colleagues and 
councillors.

It is thought to be one of the highest
ever remuneration packages for a council manager, and is more than four
times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary.

The statement of accounts for 2011-12 
revealed that Mrs  Kerswell, 49, received £139,806 of her £197,000 
salary, £420,000 in redundancy payments and a £29,359 pension 
contribution.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the 
TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the council had shown ‘scant regard’ to value 
for taxpayers’ money.

He added: ‘Councils may have a legal requirement 
to make a redundancy pay-out, but this is staggeringly excessive.

‘Councillors need to scrap the overly 
generous contracts that make these deals possible before any more money 
is blown on gargantuan redundancy pay-offs.’

Expensive business: Kent County Council headquarters. A total of £10.08million has been paid in 'exit packages' to staff between 2011 and 2012

Mrs Kerswell had a £197,136 salary in 
her previous job as chief executive of Northamptonshire County Council. 
She had defended the pay deal by saying it was equal to only 29p for 
each person in the county.

She was also lampooned at the time for
her ‘Taste the Strawberry’ campaign – management speak that was meant 
to represent the overall ‘flavour’ of the council’s services and help it
to improve its performance.

She moved to Kent in March 2010 and oversaw
a shake-up of the way the county council was run under its ‘Change To 
Keep Succeeding’ programme, which involved a cull of senior directors.

Kent County Council, which needs to 
make savings of £97million this year, paid out £10.8million in so-called
‘exit packages’ to about 1,000 staff in 2011-12. This included £172,000
to the authority’s former finance director, Lynda McMullan, who left in
September last year and now works for the National Audit Office.

History: The council gave the chief executive who Ms Kerswell replaced a £200,000 pay off

Council leader Paul Carter said: ‘Removing chief executive posts is what more and more councils should be doing.

‘Employment law and contractual 
obligations mean we have to pay significant redundancy costs, but it 
will save a fortune in the long run. Our council is now being guided by 
officers who have worked their way up and know what life is like from a 
Kent taxpayer’s perspective.’

Last year it emerged that Phil Dolan, 
the former chief executive of South Somerset District Council, which has
just 162,000 residents, had received a redundancy package of almost 
£570,000.

The transparency rules which forced the council to reveal Mrs Kerswell’s pay were introduced by the Coalition government.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps
last night criticised Mrs Kerswell’s pay deal as ‘deeply concerning’. 
He said: ‘I find dipping into the public purse to make such an 
eye-watering pay-off unacceptable.’
