A family in Pooler, Georgia, are desperately trying to raise enough money to adopt a special needs child from Eastern Europe who they hope to save from probably death within the next five years.

Christie and Raymundo Orta, together with their daughter Laura, are on a mission to raise $35,000 to adopt Evan, a two-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who lives in an orphanage.

Evan was abandoned by his parents as a one-month old and has been lying in a crib with little medical care, and no opportunity for education or therapy for the past two years.

The Orta family from Pooler, Georgia, are on a mission to raise $35,000 so they can adopt Evan, right, a two-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who is currently languishing in an orphanage in Eastern Europe

If Evan isn’t adopted by the time he is five years old, he will be transferred to an adult institution where he isn’t expected to live beyond a year or two at the most.

While the life expectancy for a child with Down Syndrome in the United States is 60 years old, in much of Eastern Europe it is 6-8 years old.

Christie Orta, a special education teacher, told WTOC that she feels it is her calling to save Evan from his likely fate.

‘It is something I do every day with my job, and I had always thought that it takes a special family to raise a child with a disability.’ she said.

The family found out about Evan via Reece’s Rainbow, an organization which seeks to find families for orphans with Down syndrome and other special needs.

The family’s fundraising efforts have so far including a cookie sale by daughter Laura and there is a Zumba fundraiser on December 6 in Pooler.

‘Evan needs us....we need him!! The only mountain standing in our way is that it will cost about $35,000 to bring Evan home....which is an UNBELIEVABLE amount of money...but when you fall in love, you set out to do amazing and miraculous things,’ Christie Orta wrote on her GoFundMe page.

‘We know that God has moved our hearts to pursue this adoption. We also have faith that God will help us to raise the amount of money needed to rescue Evan and ultimately save his life.’
