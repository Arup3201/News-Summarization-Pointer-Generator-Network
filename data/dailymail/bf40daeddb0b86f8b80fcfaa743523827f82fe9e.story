A fake TV producer who boasted of friendships with Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lopez is alleged to have cheated businesses out of thousands of dollars to fund a lavish lifestyle.

Jessie Alexander, of Miami, Florida, told business owners in Palm Beach that she worked for FOX 29 and was making a TV special that would get them publicity for a one time fee of $3,500.

The 41-year-old allegedly spent the cash she raised on spa treatments, staying in luxury hotels and shopping sprees.

She was arrested on Tuesday and charged with fraud but was released from jail on Wednesday.

Alexander has previously faced charges including burglary, prostitution and battery, dating back to 1990, according to the Sun Sentinel newspaper

Investigators said Alexander claimed she was making a show called Best of Palm Beaches to air in May 2013 - but no such program ever aired on TV.

On her LinkedIn page Alexander claims to have worked on national TV shows with actors such as Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lopez.

None of the claims could be verified by police who arrested her after complaints from several business owners.

THe 41-year-old is from Miami, Florida, but conducted her alleged scam in Palm Beach

Police said the scheme was unusual and elaborate.

'This was not a low-caliber scam,' said Palm Beach police spokesman Fred Hess.

'This was somebody who was going after the big bucks.'

According to police Alexander, who uses other aliases, claimed she was a producer from the local Fox 29 TV station and working for a PR company.

She charged businesses $3,500 to appear in her TV special.

At least eight companies paid the money, and although short videos appeared on YouTube, none were featured on TV.

When they approached Alexander for a refund they were told the TV shot had been pushed back due to scheduling conflicts.

One woman who contacted the PR firm she claimed to work for, Love PR, was told more time was needed.

Police began investigating after complaints from business owners. Fox TV confirmed Alexander did not work for them.

A review of Alexander's bank account showed the money had been spent on spas, shopping sprees and hotels.

Alexander has refused to comment after being released from jail having been charged with fraud.

Police believe there could be other victims who hare too embarrassed to admit they have been conned.

Jessie has previous records of prostitution, burglary and battery
