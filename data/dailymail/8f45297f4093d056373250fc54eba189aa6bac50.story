A convicted sex offender who had been on the run for two months was found in a hidden room that he apparently built at his wife's Illinois home.

Shawn Lipsey, a 40-year-old father, was convicted in November of six counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and two counts of indecent solicitation of a child.

He was released on bail but failed to appear at a January sentencing hearing, The Aurora Beacon-News reported.

But this week, authorities received a tip that he was at his wife's home in Newark, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. He was taken into custody following a SWAT raid on the home.  

'It was wild,' said Kendall County sheriff's Deputy Bryan Harl. 'Lipsey was located in the home, hiding in a specially constructed room. He made a fake wall, and it had hinges. He was hiding behind it.'

The room looked lived-in, Harl said. Deputies don't know how long Lipsey had been hiding inside the home, which is on a rural road near just a handful of other houses.

'Once we located him, Lipsey surrendered and was taken into custody,' Harl said. 'There was no resistance. There was no fighting.'

On the run: Lipsey had been convicted of multiple sex offences in November but then went into hiding

Hidden: Lipsey was kept inside a home on this quiet street in Newark, Illinois, but it is not clear for how long

The team looking for him included officers from the Kendall County Sheriff's Office, the county's Cooperative Assistance Team and U.S. marshals. 

He remains in custody on a no-bond warrant and faced a hearing on Friday afternoon.

His wife, Raissa Jarosz-Lipsey, 40, was also charged with obstruction of justice, concealing or aiding a fugitive and filing a false police report for allegedly knowing where he was when she reported him missing.

Her bail has been set at $500,000 and she remains in custody.
