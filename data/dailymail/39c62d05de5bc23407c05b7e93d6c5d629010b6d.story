A Tunisian newspaper publisher has been freed on bail after printing a racy photo of Real Madrid football player Sami Khedira covering the breasts of his model girlfriend, Lena Gercke.

Nassridine Ben Saida, publisher of the daily newspaper, Attounissia, was arrested on February 15  after publishing the cover of GQ along with the editor and one of the paper’s journalists.

He was released by the Primary Court of Tunis earlier today and his trial on charges of violating public decency has been postponed until March 8.

The controversial photo showed the German-Tunisian football 
player Sami Khedira dressed in a tuxedo with his hands 
covering the breasts of his naked German model girlfriend, 
Lena Gercke.

During yesterday's hearing he sought to violate moral decency by publishing the photo in the newspaper's February 15 edition.

'I had no intention of infringing moral decencies. This is about a well-known footballer and in addition, the photo had an artistic dimension,' he said.

One of his lawyers, Abderraouf Ayadi, told the court that 'there is nothing to justify the arrest of my client, especially since the copies of newspapers were quickly recalled from the stands.'

Another lawyer, Chokri Belaid, said the arrest was a 'political decision.'

'We know that at the moment in Tunisia, there is a combat between those who defend freedom and those who want to repress it,' he said.

'This trial is a major test for 
Tunisian justice, which we call on to show its independence and prove 
that it is not just applying any instructions,' he added.

Footballer Sami Khedira is popular in the Islamic state because his father is Tunisian, but
the arrest has sparked a national debate in the country about the limits of
freedom of expression and how the government should decide on issues 
they regard as immoral.

‘I heard about the matter on Thursday 
evening and find it very, very sad and unfortunate that such a thing 
happened,' the 24-year-old Khedira told German newspaper Bild.

'I respect the different religions that exist and also the faith that 
people have, but I cannot understand that people cannot express 
themselves freely.'

Several of Nassridine Ben Saida's colleagues showed up in the packed court to support him.

Tunisian national figures including Constituent Assembly member Salma Baccar and Hamma Hammami, head of the Tunisian Communist Party, as well as human rights activist Radhia Nasraoui.

Mokhtar Trifi, a renowned Tunisian human rights activist and lawyer, called the arrest illegitimate and said that the detention occurred due to orders from above.

He deemed the trial a test case for the Tunisian Judicial system.

Last week, The Union of Tunisian Journalists expressed its disappointment over the decision of the preliminary court against the release of Mr Ben Saida.

After his arrest, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement demanding his immediate release, in which they called Mr Ben Saida 'the first media executive to be jailed in the post-Ben Ali era.'

RSF expressed their concern with the fact that Tunisian journalists may face a prison sentence for a newspaper article, stating that the threat of imprisonment sends an extremely disturbing signal to all those who defend freedom of expression.

'This is a hypocritical reaction because photos of this kind often appear on the cover of foreign magazines sold in Tunisia,' RSF said.
