A Liberal Democrat candidate said he 'regrets' using a selfie he took in front of a crematorium furnace as his profile picture on a mobile dating app.

Josh Mason took a photo of himself posing at the Kirkleatham Memorial Park and Crematorium near Yearby, North Yorkshire, and later uploaded it to Facebook and dating app Tinder. 

The 26-year-old, who will stand as the party's parliamentary candidate for Redcar in the General Election in May, said today he 'deeply regretted' any offence he may have caused.

But he stopped short of apologising for the photograph, which has been branded as 'disrespectful' by political opponents. 

The photo was first published on website Political Scrapbook, who claimed it was taken by Mr Mason while he was on a guided tour of the crematorium at its official opening last June.

It shows Mr Mason, who is deputy leader of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, pulling a face  in front of the furnace. Roughly 400 cremations had already taken place there at the time.

Mr Mason uploaded the image to Tinder, which finds potential matches based on a user's location and Facebook information.

Users then decide whether they want to make contact with any of the suggested dates - based mainly on the photos on their profile. 

Mr Mason's photo has been slammed as 'insensitive' by one  opponent, who called on him to apologise.

Anna Turley, Labour's candidate for the seat, said: 'I am surprised that he would be so insensitive to families who have lost loved ones and show so little awareness of how his actions could offend.'

'I think he should apologise'.

In a statement, Mr Mason said: 'Being born and bred in Redcar and Cleveland, I imagine that one day, Yearby Crematorium will be my own final destination.

'My visit there was a stark reminder of our shared mortality. Indeed, I have already said a last 'goodbye' to a number of family friends and colleagues there.

'Nevertheless, I deeply regret any offence I may have caused.'

Mr Mason hopes to replace Redcar's current Lib Dem MP, Ian Swales, who is standing down in May.
