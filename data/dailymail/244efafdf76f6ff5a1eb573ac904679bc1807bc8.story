Riots: Hundreds of Chelsea football fans have gone on the rampage in Paris, France - smashing up cafes and shop windows and hurling abuse at opposing fans - ahead of tonight's UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg

'We're trying to contain the violence but it's spreading,' said one officer on the scene, as riot units arrived on mass.

Flares were let off, and the small, packed streets was soon filled with thick black smoke.

'It's terrifying - I just want to get out of here,' said Sarah Avel, a 16-year-old French student. 'We could hear the chanting all afternoon but we didn't expect fighting.'

The fans had been drinking for most of the afternoon outside the Frog and Rosbif pub before they moved across the road to The Thistle.

It was there that the fighting started, as some of the fans could be heard chanting English Defence League songs in front of black Parisians.

A group of around 100 fans then ran down the Rue St Denis, towards the Seine river, smashing up anything in their path.
