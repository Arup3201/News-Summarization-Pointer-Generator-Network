Critical care nurse David Hadfield, 54, allegedly struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead

A nurse repeatedly headbutted an elderly patient in his care who was struggling to breathe, a court has heard today.

Critical care nurse David Hadfield, 54, allegedly struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead leaving him with three cuts while he was being treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire. 

Mr Bretherton had been admitted after being diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and was 'confused' and struggling to breathe when he was attacked, Preston Crown Court heard.

He died shortly after the alleged attack, although the prosecution stresses this was in no way related to the incident.

Hadfield denies wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding.

Tim Storrie, prosecuting, said: 'Thomas Bretherton was struck more than once causing wounds to open on his head after he was repeatedly headbutted.

'The prosecution say that the manner of the attack, coupled with the knowledge of how sick Mr Bretherton was, means that this attack manifested an intention to cause harm. Not just harm, but really serious harm.'

Mr Bretherton went into hospital in August last year and was required to wear a CPAP hood - a clear soft plastic helmet with a continuous supply of oxygen designed to help patients who have problems breathing.

The victim was also known to be very distressed and confused because of medication he was taking, the jury heard.

On August 6, Mr Storrie said Hadfield, who was assigned to look after Mr Bretherton, decided it was necessary to change his sheet.

The court heard from Lucy Wood, one of Hadfield's colleagues, who has worked as a critical care nurse for 13 years.

She told the court she and another nurse had been asked to help him with his task.

Miss Wood said: 'David asked us to try and be quiet, not to talk to the patient much because he had been unsettled earlier in the day. So we tried not to disturb him much.'

The witness said that after changing the sheet, Mr Bretherton woke up.

She added: 'He was startled. He said words to the effect of 'get away from me'.

'He did not know what was going on. He was kind of flailing his arms around.'

During the incident, Miss Wood's finger was bent back and she had to let go of Mr Bretherton's hand as she screamed out in pain, the court heard.

Mr Bretherton also managed to pull a monitoring machine off his finger and broke it.

The jury heard how Hadfield decided it was necessary to administer the sedative Haloperidol to try to calm the patient down and as he tried to find his canula, their heads collided.

Miss Wood said: 'David was close to the bedside trying to give the medication. The patient sat up and caught him.

'David said 'come on then' to the patient. It felt like he was inviting the patient to do that again, to hit him in the face.

'The patient was still agitated. David lunged forward.

'It was like they were both lunging forward at the same time, clashing heads again.

'It all happened quite quickly, but I was stunned that David retaliated against a patient who was obviously confused instead of trying to calm him down.'

The witness told jurors that after the third clash, Hadfield asked for somebody to get a doctor to see Mr Bretherton and was 'concerned' about how he was.

Simon Nichol, for the defendant, of Oldham, said Hadfield had become unbalanced because of the way he was trying to hold Mr Bretherton's arm steady so that he could give the medication.

He told the court: 'Each time the patient brought his head forward towards David, David was pulling his head down to avoid being hit again in the face.'

Miss Wood replied: 'It did not look like he was avoiding the patient. It seemed like he was making a focused movement towards the centre of his head.'

Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although Mr Storrie stressed that his death was not related at all to the incident.

Hadfield claims that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheet and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him

Hadfield claims that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheet and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him.

But giving evidence at court, his colleague Leanne Whittaker, a staff nurse, said: 'This was a very poorly patient. He wouldn't have had the energy to move himself forward.

'I was stood at the nurses' station and I was alerted that there was shouting.

'It got louder and then I heard something like 'shut up and lie down'.

'It was a man's voice. I put the monitor on so I could see what was going on and it looked like Hadfield threw himself forcefully into the patient.

'He did this three times and made contact three times with the patient's forehead.

'I shouted out "that is absolutely disgusting" and everybody was shocked.

'When I went into the room, Hadfield seemed agitated and the sister asked him to leave.

'I took over his care after that.'

The court heard that Mr Bretherton had been 'calm and sleeping' when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheet.

Another colleague, Caroline Piper, who had been standing 40 feet away, also turned on her monitor when she heard shouting coming from the room.

She told the court: 'The patient was lying at a 45 degree angle. 

'There was one nurse on one side of him and two on the other. 'His hands were being held and so he was trying to sit forward.

'He did lunge forward with his head but he did not make contact with David.

'He wasn't near enough to make contact. David then lunged with his head towards the patient and I saw their heads clash.

'David lunged towards him three times. 'I was stunned and baffled by what I saw and I couldn't make sense of it.'

Hadfield, who wrote down his account of what happened in his staff notes the night of the incident on August 6, 2013, said that Mr Bretherton became 'abusive' as he tried to reposition him. 

He said: 'It was evident that he was confused and paranoid when he was advised that he was in hospital.

'He started to hit out and we avoided his blows. He gripped my hand and had my elbow locked.

'He then headbutted me. He had my elbow trapped and pulled me towards him.

'He then headbutted me two further times before I could free myself.

'His head was bleeding and I called out for help.'

The trial continues.
