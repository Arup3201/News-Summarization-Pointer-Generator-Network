Causing a stink: Birmingham councillor Graham Green has accused binmen of believing they have a 'God-given' right to finish work before noon and 'put their feet up'

Binmen believe they have a 'God-given' right to finish work before noon and 'put their feet up', a councillor has claimed.

Graham Green, a Conservative councillor in Birmingham, launched the astonishing attack as union leaders revealed plans for a five-day strike among refuse teams in the city.

The walkout, over planned changes to working arrangements, threatens to herald a return to the scenes of the start of this year, when bin bags festered in the streets for up to six weeks during an earlier dispute.

Mr Green said: 'They need to come into the real world. I'm sure they're going to upset a large number of residents again.

'I listened to their union representative the other day and he seems to think they have a God-given right to start early in the morning, wake half the city then finish at 11.30am and put their feet up for the rest of the day.

'We all have to live in a different world where every penny is accounted for.'

Mr Green also said that strike action could ultimately lead the council to seek a private contractor to deal with the city's rubbish.

Binmen staged a one-day strike and imposed work-to-rule measures last December in a row over the loss of bonus money said to average out at Â£4,000 per worker.

Union officials said the latest dispute essentially involved issues from the last industrial action which had not yet been settled.

Steve Foster, of Unite, would not be drawn on Mr Green's comments about binmen 'putting their feet up'.

But he said refuse workers wanted to work with the council to avoid the strike, earmarked to start on November 28.

Mr Foster said: 'This is a knock-on of issues from the past dispute. They (the council) came out with a reorganisation that could result in less pay and less posts.

The workforce has had to say "enough".

'We've said we're prepared to meet 
the council any time, any where, to solve the dispute and have been 
invited to a meeting on Wednesday and we hope that is to start resolving
the dispute.

'We don't want to end up in a dispute, our members won't get paid for five days.

'Workers want to go out and do their jobs but it's frustrating for them having to be in a dispute.'

Figures
showed just 141 of around 700 Unite and GMB members employed at 
Birmingham City Council voted in the strike ballot, with 106 in favour 
of the action.

A city council spokesman said: 'The 
council will make every effort to ensure contingencies are in place 
should any action occur.

'It
must also be remembered that industrial action can take many forms and 
does not necessarily mean employees going on strike.'
