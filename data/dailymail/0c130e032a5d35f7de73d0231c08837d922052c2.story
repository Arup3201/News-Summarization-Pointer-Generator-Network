After a career working with some of European football’s top clubs, Jose Mourinho has experienced the highs and lows of management.

On Friday, as he raised his right arm high into the air to emphasise his point, Mourinho wanted it made clear to Graeme Souness and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher that he remains at the top of his game.

It was a low blow, calling the Sky Sports analysts out because they dared to criticise Chelsea’s players for surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers during the Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

Mourinho came up with another famous quip: ‘Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man'

Mourinho claimed they were envious of his success as a coach, claiming the former Liverpool players have short memories after their careers at the top of the sport.

The Chelsea manager said: ‘Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. It’s about life.

‘The difference between me and Souness is this: Souness as a player, up there (raises arm). Jose as a player, down here. Jose as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there.’

With that the Chelsea manager pulled one of those faces that suggested the pair do not even belong on the same planet, let alone Souness having the right to pass comment on his team. It did not end there.

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful'

Mourinho added: ‘I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. He was a fantastic player. I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players.

‘You know the world is a bit strange — maybe with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, memories are getting shorter.

‘When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it’s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago.

‘I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I’m a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh.’

Souness managed Benfica for two years, between 1997 and 1999; Mourinho was the Portuguese club’s coach for a short spell between September 2000 and December 2000.

Chelsea’s manager was spiky on Friday, confrontational at times as he attempted to put a positive spin on a negative result in the last 16 of the Champions League.

The guard dropped again when he claimed Chelsea would definitely win the Barclays Premier League and he went on to make a case that they should be ‘eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 points’ clear of Manchester City.

In public he is supporting his squad, although he was less than keen to divulge details of the 30-minute team meeting held at the training ground the day after their elimination.

‘Nobody was shy,’ was about the most he was prepared to say after he called his players together for a cathartic exercise that you can imagine ended with the squad accepting the blame.

They certainly take responsibility for ill-discipline, with Mourinho revealing that his players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee.

Chelsea were fined £30,000 by the Premier League after they were charged following the behaviour of their players towards Jonathan Moss on February 11.

Mourinho, preparing for Saturday's clash with Southampton at Stamford Bridge, added: ‘If they surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine.

‘We have, in this moment, I think eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once. We paid for that. It’s simple. Go to the Premier League and see how many teams were charged and how many times. Chelsea were charged once.

‘Everybody would love to be in our position. We closed the chapter on the Champions League, but we still have the book to write.

‘If you want to talk about the Champions League, speak with Wenger or Pellegrini. We have 11 more matches to finish the book. Let’s see if the last page of the book is with the Premier League trophy in their hands.’
