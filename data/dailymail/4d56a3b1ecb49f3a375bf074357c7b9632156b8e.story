School reforms risk creating ‘exam robots’ who can pass tests but struggle to succeed in life, the business leaders have warned.

John Cridland, the head of the CBI, warned Michael Gove’s focus on ‘rigour’ in education risked squeezing out the skills needed by employers.

And he hit out at teachers with no experience from outside the classroom who do not see the value of pupils doing work experience.

Mr Gove, Education Secretary, has ordered an end to almost all GCSE coursework and a return to make-or-break exams at the end of two-year courses of study.

He argues an overhauled national curriculum ‘embodies rigour and high standards’, with renewed focus on grammar, spelling and punctuation.

But Mr Cridland said businesses want school leavers to also have creativity, curiosity, tenacity and good manners.

Plans to teach more dates and facts about history risk turning children off the subject, the authotu of Horrible Histories has warned.

Terry Deary told The Times 'History should be peoplecentred, not fact-centred.'

He added: 'W.B. Yeats said "education isn't about filling buckets, it's about lighting fires".

'That should be written on parchment, rolled up and stuffed down Mr Gove's throat.'

He told The Times: ‘Employers want young people who are enthusiastic, confident, creative and resilient, not just exam robots.

‘It has got more difficult for schools. I think what [Mr Gove] has done is necessary but not sufficient

‘He should talk about rigour and we should be more rigorous and he has my vote to do that. If all you do is talk about rigour then the rounded and groundedness gets squeezed out.

‘When I walk into a really inspirational school there is a whole education experience and all the components of that school contribute to that educational experience.’

Mr Cridland will use a speech today to urge headteachers to do more to prepare young people for the world of work.

He suggests Ofsted inspectors should look at everything schools do, including spot, clubs and extra-curricular activities, and not just their academic performance.

Mr Cridland added: ‘It would help if more teachers and head teachers had experience outside the classroom.

‘We should try to encourage that, so they don't go from school to university, teacher training, back into the classroom without having stepped out of the education world into the world they are helping to serve.’
