Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has never been afraid to stand out from the crowd.

The former Spain international is a triathlon addict, who took to watching training sessions at Roma and Celta Vigo from a homemade scaffolding tower because it improved his view of his players.

And now the lid has been lifted on another of his distinctive features – the sunglasses he wears at every Barcelona training session.

The 
44-year-old coach suffers from Pterygium – a growth of fleshy tissue 
that covers the white of the eye and is also known as surfers’ eye 
because it more commonly affects people who spend a lot of time out of 
doors, and frequently surfers.

The
 slow-growing complaint does not usually end up affecting vision or 
needing surgery and sufferers can ease the condition by wearing  
sunglasses.

So
 while the aforementioned scaffold tower will not be in evidence at 
Barcelona’s Joan Gamper training ground because, says Enrique: ‘the view
 is just fine from the stands that look out on to pitches’, the 
sunglasses are here to stay.
