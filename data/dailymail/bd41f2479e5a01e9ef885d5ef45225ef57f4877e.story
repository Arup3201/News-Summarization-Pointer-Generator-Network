A man who was so fat he stopped breathing up to 80 times a night has shed 17 stone after doctors warned him he would die within two years. 

Kayes Uddin, 32, weighed 30 stone and was so obese he developed sleep apnoea, which caused his windpipe to close every time he dozed off.

As a result, the father-of-three from Newham, London, had to wear a mask at night to keep his airway open while he slept.

Kayes Uddin lost 17 stone after gastric bypass surgery. He dropped from 30 stone (left) to 13 stone (right). Before his weight loss, he had severe sleep apnoea and had been given just two years to live

The council project manager underwent gastric bypass surgery on the NHS and lost a massive 17 stone. He can now sleep without fearing he will never wake up.

Now 13 stone, he said: ‘Being diagnosed with sleep apnoea was my lowest point. To be told my breathing was stopping at night because I was so fat was terrifying.

‘I was scared to sleep in case I never woke up.

‘Now I’m so fit I’ve cured the condition and don’t have to wear a mask in bed every night.’

Sleep apnoea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep.

It occurs when the muscles and tissue in the throat collapse causing a blockage of the airways.

Due to his sleep apnoea, Mr Uddin had to wear breathing apparatus during the night to stop his airway closing up. He no longer needs it now he has lost so much weight

Mr Uddin (pictured before his weight loss surgery) had such bad sleep apnoea that he stopped breathing up to 80 times a night and he feared he would die in his sleep

It is associated with being overweight and some patients have to wear a mask at night to prevent their throat closing.

Mr Uddin finally sought help from his GP in 2011 after a life long battle with his weight.

Thanks
 to a diet of curry, junk food and fizzy drinks, by the age of 15 he 
weighed 15 stone and had to wear a customised school uniform.

Mr Uddin has revolutionised his diet and his sleep apnoea has disappeared. He says he is now able to play with his children without becoming exhausted

He said: ‘I stood out a mile, but it was easier to hide the pain and carry on eating than try to diet. It seemed impossible.’

By the time he left school, he was more than 17 stone and continued to grow after getting married and starting a family.

He explained: ‘With each baby that came along my wife and I both put on weight. We were eating a typical Asian diet with lots of fat as well as take outs, sweets and junk.’

Before:

Breakfast: Full fry upBreakfast two: Pastry, biscuits and coffeeSnack: Crisps, chocolate, fizzy drinkLunch: Kebab or chicken and chips, fizzy drinkSnack: ChocolateSnack: Coffee and more chocolateSnack after work: Cup of tea and biscuitsDinner: Chicken curry and rice - two platesSnack: Ice cream with flake and syrup

Now:

Breakfast: Water, Weetabix or porridgeSnack: Yoghurt or apple and bottle of waterLunch: Chicken or fish with salad or soupSnack: Yoghurt blended with fruitDinner: Either fish or chicken with vegetablesSnack: Bottle of water

By his mid-twenties Mr Uddin weighed 30 stone and had to wear specially ordered 7XL size clothing.

He said: ‘I couldn’t walk without getting out of breath. Playing with the children left me exhausted and I knew I had to do something but didn’t know where to start.’

Then he started waking with pounding headaches and suffered unexplained tiredness.

He said: ‘It didn’t make sense because I was going to bed at the same time but woke feeling like I’d stepped out of the boxing ring.’

Then his wife Lufta, 30, noticed he was waking with a start throughout the night.

It got worse and he started leaping out of bed gasping for breath before falling asleep and doing the same again.

Tests confirmed he was suffering with sleep apnoea. It had been triggered by his weight and was caused by fatty tissue at the back of the neck blocking his airway as he lay down to sleep.

The only solution was to sleep with a mask on that regulated his breathing.

He said: ‘It looked like a gas mask. I felt so old and useless before my time but it was keeping me alive.’

Mr Uddin’s GP eventually referred him
 for gastric surgery on the NHS. The operation in July 2011 meant he 
could only consume tiny portions.

Mr Uddin said: 'Being diagnosed with sleep apnoea was my lowest point. To be told my breathing was stopping at night because I was so fat was terrifying. I was scared to sleep in case I never woke up'

Mr Uddin said: 'I couldn't walk without getting out of breath. Playing with the children left me exhausted and I knew I had to do something but didn't know where to start'

Within the first five months he lost nine stone, curing his sleep apnoea and meaning he could stop wearing the mask.

He said: ‘It was a great feeling to go to bed without it. It’s fair to say it had been a passion killer.’

Earlier this year he reached his target weight of 13 stone – losing 20 inches from his waist, which went from 50 inches to 30 inches.

Now he walks to work every day and runs three miles most evenings.

His sons, Fahim, 11, Farhan, nine and daughter, Maisha, three, love having a new fit father to play with.

Mr Uddin says that his weight loss has changed his whole family's lives as they have started eating more healthily and taking more exercise

Mr Uddin said: ‘The whole family has benefited. We have all adopted a totally healthy new approach to our eating and fitness. I can easily keep up with the children now and they love having the fit dad they deserve.

‘The operation was the starting point, but I’ve enjoyed success because I’ve been committed and worked with it to get the best results.

‘It’s not the quick fix people think it is, but if you commit to healthy eating and exercise, the results can be amazing.’

Sleep apnoea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep.

It occurs when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a blockage in the airway.

When this happens, the person tends to wake up momentarily while their breathing returns to normal.

When they slip back into a deep sleep they often stop breathing again.

Many people with sleep apnoea snore and they often feel tired during the day as their sleep is interrupted.

It is associated with being overweight. Other risk factors include having a large neck, taking sleeping pills, drinking alcohol and smoking.

Sleep apnoea affects about four per cent of middle aged men and two per cent of middle aged women in the UK.

It can affect people of any age but it most common in middle aged people.

Some cases can be treated through lifestyle changes - such as losing weight - but people with more severe cases may require breathing apparatus to keep their airway open.

If left untreated, sleep apnoea can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and diabetes.
