It's hardly the usual sort of family heirloom handed down to generations.

But this hot cross bun that was baked in 1821 is a cherished treasure that has been passed down through five generations.

The Easter treat was baked on Good Friday in 1821 and still has a cross on the top.

The fruity bun, which has even retained its smell, was made by Nancy's great, great, great grandfather, William Skinner, who owned a bakery in London

Nancy said: 'It's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every Good Friday'

Nancy Titman cradles the 192-year-old bun - which shows no trace of mould

Nancy Titman, 94, keeps the 192-year-old bun in a box and, although undoubtedly past its sell-by-date, still shows no traces of mould.

The
fruity bun, which has even retained its smell, was made by Nancy's 
great, great, great grandfather, William Skinner, who owned a bakery in 
London.

It was made in the same year as Napolean died, George IV was crowned king, poet John Keats passed away and John Constable painted his famous Hay Wain picture.

'It's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every Good Friday,' said Nancy.

'It is rock hard like a fossil and the currants have disintegrated, but it still smells and looks like a hot cross bun, with the cross on the top.'

Nancy was given the bun, which has the date March 1821 on the base, by her mother.

Now she plans to hand it down to her own daughter, Anthea and her 10-year-old granddaughter, Hannah.

'My mum said our ancestors worked in a baker's shop and they believed buns baked on Good Friday didn't go mouldy, which this has proved,' added Nancy, from Deeping St James, Lincolnshire.

'I think it was kept as it was made on 
Good Friday, which was a very special day. It has been preserved in a 
box for nearly 200 years now.

The practice of eating special small cakes during Spring dates back at least to the ancient Greeks.

The English custom of eating spiced buns on Good Friday was perhaps institutionalized in Tudor times, when a London bylaw was introduced forbidding the sale of such buns except on Good Friday, at Christmas, and at burials.

English folklore suggests that sharing a hot cross bun would ensure friendship throughout the coming year.

If taken on a voyage hot cross buns are said to protect against shipwreck.

If hung in a kitchen they are thought to protect against fires and ensure that all breads turn out perfectly.

'It's a rather unusual family heirloom, but I'm proud of it and we still get the bun out of its box every Easter.'

Hot cross buns with their combination of sweet, spicy and fruity flavours first became popular in Tudor times and have long been an Easter tradition, with the pastry cross symbolising the crucifixion.

In the 19th century many people believed that hot cross buns baked on Good Friday would not go mouldy and had special healing powers.

They thought the buns could be used as a cure for medical complaints such as indigestion.

Some people even grated fossilized remains of the Easter snack on wounds to help them heal or mixed it with water to make medicine.

The preserved bun has astonished bakers, who can't believe it has survived so long.

Fresh hot cross buns usually only last for a few days before they start to go off.

Conrad Taylor, owner of Holmelea Bakery, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, said: 'It's quite amazing that it has survived for so long and extremely unusual.

'I've been told that you can varnish buns to keep the air out and stop them going mouldy, but I haven't heard of bakery products surviving without that.'
