Facelifts can be the object of derision - with many people seeing them as vanity, even if they do have the desired rejuvenating effect. But for Jackie Phillips, the operation represented the closing chapter in her battle with skin cancer which ate away part of her cheek and half  of her nose.

The 67-year-old feels transformed after state-of-the-art surgery took years off her appearance.

Not only has her jawline been tightened  but her face, which was left lopsided despite reconstructive surgery, has been evened up, with fat suctioned from her tummy, then injected into her cheeks.

Jackie Pillips, 67, feels transformed after state-of-the-art surgery took years off her appearance

Recalling the terrifying hours before surgeons first operated to remove the cancer, Jackie says: 'They said they didn't know whether they would have to remove half or all of my nose.

'I'm not proud of my looks but I challenge anyone to be told this and not feel desperately worried. I know I was one of the lucky ones - when I woke up from the operation, at least I was alive. You draw your reserves from that. In the end, I felt huge relief that they hadn't taken my whole nose.'

Jackie was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a slow-growing form of skin cancer, in her right nostril after her dentist expressed concern about blistering inside her nose.

What Jackie had thought was a small, painless blackhead - which had been there for  six or seven years - started to bubble up and blister. Her GP referred her to a private consultant, who immediately recognised it  as a sign of cancer.

Like most skin cancers, BCCs are triggered by sun exposure, and Jackie believes she  and her 73-year-old husband Howard's hobby of travelling the world in open-top cars may have been to blame.

The couple, who now live on the Isle of Man, retired in 1997 after selling their business, a firm that designed and manufactured food-processing equipment.

BCCs don't respond to chemotherapy, so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options

After a six-hour operation to remove the cancer at Winterbourne Hospital in Dorset, surgeons discovered the carcinoma had burrowed upwards through the muscle and fat in her cheek, beside her nose, and the main root was found dangerously close to the outside corner of her right eye.

BCCs don't respond to chemotherapy, so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options.

'A round hole more than 1in in diameter on my cheek was taken away,' says Jackie. 'They stretched skin from my cheek over to close it up. The lower portion of my right nostril was removed and I had further work carried out the following year to improve this.'

She was initially pleased with the cosmetic result. But the right side of her face had a tighter appearance than the left, and she  lost the normal groove down the right-hand side of her nose.

As time went on, her face began to appear more and more uneven. 'I hated having my photo taken and even avoided looking in the mirror as much as possible,' Jackie adds.

Last year she sought help from Kevin Hancock, who works at the Private Patient Unit of the Noble's Hospital in Douglas on the  Isle of Man.

He says: 'Jackie had been left with a significant deformity. She asked me to improve the symmetry of her face, but we can do better than that.'

Mr Hancock began by releasing the scar tissue from Jackie's original operation to make it less tight and carried out the lower facelift, making several incisions starting in the hairline above her ear and going down around her ear.

Then about 150ml of fat was suctioned from Jackie's abdomen, and centrifuged to remove blood and oil. The remaining 50ml of fat was injected into her cheeks.

Mr Hancock says: 'Traditional facelift surgery tightens and pulls up but doesn't restore volume lost in the face. Fat filling creates a fuller, younger-looking face.'

Jackie says: 'I looked like a Cabbage Patch Doll when I first came round, but Kevin had warned me that this would be the case.

'They put in twice as much fat as you really need because your body absorbs a lot of it, so I was very puffy and bruised.'

Demand for cosmetic procedures has increased but for cancer patients, survival is the priority

Three weeks later, her face had settled down and Jackie was delighted. 'It's a massive turnaround from thinking I would always be unhappy with my appearance to feeling like I look the best I ever have,' she says. 'My husband is just happy that I'm happy.'

Because of the extra time, equipment and expertise involved, Jackie's procedure costs about 25 per cent extra on top of the price of a normal facelift, and patients can expect to pay about £7,000 or more for the surgery.

The latest figures from the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons showed that demand for cosmetic procedures, including facelifts and fat-filling like Jackie's, increased by more than ten per  cent in the past year. But for patients in the immediate aftermath of a cancer diagnosis, survival is the priority.

'We'd never carry out this sort of facelift surgery at the same time as removing a cancer as we wouldn't want to compromise the cancer treatment,' says Mr Hancock, who also carries out facial reconstruction for  skin cancer patients on the NHS.

'With skin cancer it's obviously important  to cut it out completely and leave a safety zone around it to make sure it doesn't  come back.

'With someone's back or tummy you have loads of slack, but if what you're cutting out is on someone's face, you're going to leave a  big hole.

'The most important thing is to treat the skin cancer properly. But it's important that patients know it isn't simply a choice between survival and being left disfigured.'
