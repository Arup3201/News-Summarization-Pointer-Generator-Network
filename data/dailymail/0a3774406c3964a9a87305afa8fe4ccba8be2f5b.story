The anesthesiologist who was among the three physicians attending to Joan Rivers during the botched throat procedure that led to her death has finally been named.

Dr. Renuka Reddy Bankulla, 46, was up until Sunday the sole unnamed doctor at present at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy during the August 28 procedure.

Her identity was revealed Sunday as Rivers' daughter Melissa gears up to file a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the Upper East Side clinic.

Named: Dr. Renuka Reddy Bankulla, 46, the anesthesiologist who was among the three physicians attending to Joan Rivers during the botched throat procedure that led to her death has finally been named

Dr. Bankulla, who was educated in India and trained in New York City, is no longer employed at the clinic, the New York Post reports. 

Not only has Dr. Bankulla declined to speak to the press, she refused to cooperate with investigators from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service during their probe into the matter.

She said only that she administered 120 milligrams of the anesthesia drug propofol and not the 300mg indicated in medical records. 

Bankulla claims she simply double clicked while entering the data to a computer, causing the error.

According to the Post, she also failed to indicate Rivers weight, which is a vital bit of information for choosing the amount of anesthesia to administer.

Rivers could have been saved following her medical procedure gone wrong if doctors had headed signs the comedian was going into shock, claims the investigation's report.

Rivers' doctors ignored her dropping blood pressure and pulse and even failed to call 911 for 10 precious minutes as they attempted to resuscitate her once they realized she was dying, according to Page Six.

Prior to that, insiders, outside experts and the findings of a federal report revealed that Drs. Lawrence Cohen and Gwen Korovin--along with Bankulla--carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with Rivers.

But something was wrong at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28 and the trouble started after 9am, when Rivers was put under with normal vital signs.

Fifteen minutes later, Rivers started showing signs of shock as her blood pressure  dropped to 92/54 and her pulse fell to 56.

'At this point, something has gone wrong, the procedure must come to an end, and she needs to be resuscitated,' a veteran paramedic not involved in the case told the Post.

The doctors failed to act when Rivers' vital signs dropped even further, reports the Post.

Instead, with the 81-year-old's blood pressure at 89/44 and her pulse at 54, the doctors administered propofol--the powerful anesthetic that led to the death of Michael Jackson.

'That doesn’t make any sense,' said Page Six's paramedic. 'You’re sedating someone who’s going into shock.'

Even as she began coding, with her bp at 84/40, and her pulse at 47, the examination reportedly continued.

That was at 9:28am, 12 minutes after Rivers' vital signs should have first caused concern. Still, the examination continued, with just an increase to her oxygen flow.

Two minutes later, the examination was stopped and records show the doctors began trying to resuscitate Rivers with life-saving drugs.

They wouldn't call 911 for another ten minutes. And records indicate they did not administer CPR as they awaited the paramedics.

By the time they arrived at 9:47, paramedics found Rivers' turning blue form lack of oxygen.

A state report released early in November said the clinic 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention.'

Scene: The tragedy unfolded at Yorkville Endoscopy on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in August. Dr. Bankulla is reportedly no longer employed at the clinic
