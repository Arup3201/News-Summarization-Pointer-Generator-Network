Police Federation chairman Steve White said many victims of crime do not call police because they feel 'nothing will be done' 

Many victims of crime do not bother to call the police because they feel ‘nothing will be done’, a top officer admitted yesterday.

Thousands of offences are going unrecorded as people ask themselves ‘what’s the point?’ said Police Federation chairman Steve White.

Mr White, who represents more than 130,000 rank-and-file officers, said forces are not sending out police ‘as they once would’. 

And he said repeated Government claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar.

He also condemned comments made by the head of the police watchdog this weekend that police may pursue offences that ‘matter most to people’ above offences such as shoplifting. 

In an unusually outspoken response, Mr White branded Sir Tom’s comments as ‘disgustingly offensive’ and ‘extraordinarily ignorant’.

He said they are founded on the mistaken belief that there are fewer crimes for police to deal with and that forces will inevitably shrink.

‘Crime isn’t falling,’ he said. ‘Many people don’t report crime now because they feel nothing will be done and they are right. What’s the point? I have every sympathy with them.

‘Forces have to decide on their local priorities because they don’t have the resources or time to deal with everything.

‘That means officers are not being sent out to deal with incidents as they once would have been.

‘Officers are being forced not to turn up to crimes because they have no time to deal with them. This is not what they signed up to do.

‘And while I do agree, some crimes are less serious than others, this is not the case for the victim. It is disgustingly offensive to suggest that one victim deserves a better service than another.’

Mr White has personal experience of the phenomenon of unrecorded crime after his daughter, a university student in Manchester, was robbed before Christmas.

She did not dial 999, despite being targeted by a cycling robber who snatched her bag, as she knew others had also been targeted and police seemed powerless.

Mr White said: ‘She told me: "It happens all the time around here. They [the police] can’t do anything. I didn’t get a look at the man and there is no CCTV so what’s the point?"

‘The point is that unless you record the crimes the police do not know what has happened and they cannot do anything about it.

He said repeated Government claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar (file picture) 

‘This is something that is reflected not just among students and universities but up and down the country from shed break-ins to vandalism.’ 

Sir Tom described Mr White’s comments as ‘regrettably intemperate and wholly misconceived’.

Defending his understanding of the pressures on police, the watchdog denied suggesting some victims deserve a better service than others.

He said: ‘It is important that the police service, policing institutions and those who represent police officers work together to ensure that policing is improved.

‘That requires a debate conducted in a dignified and intelligent fashion.’

Sir Tom, who was knighted in the New Year honours list, also said police facing stringent budget cuts will need to ‘work smarter’. 

The Chief Inspector of the Constabulary suggested forces must analyse demand and target more serious crimes such as drugs, violent offences and the sexual exploitation of children.

Mr White also branded comments made by Sir Tom Winsor (pictured) as 'disgustingly offensive'

He said: ‘Any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously, however there are crimes that are more serious than others.

‘Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people …’

The row comes as forces continue to feel the impact of substantial budget cuts which led to them shedding more than 30,000 officers and staff.

Further job losses are expected as chief constables warn they have stripped back administrative and other costs to the bone.

Last month Lincolnshire Chief Constable Neil Rhodes said his force will effectively go out of business within three years if funding is cut further.

In November forces covering nearly half the population of England and Wales were criticised for failing to investigate crime properly.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said forces are stuck in the past, using out-dated methods to deal with modern-day offences such as cybercrime.

The watchdog said investigations are sub-standard in 18 of the 43 police forces covering 28 million people including cities such as London, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.

The failures were laid bare a week after forces were criticised for ‘indefensible’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappear from official figures.
