The medals of an RAF pilot who downed 22 Nazi fighters during World War II are expected to fetch £50,000 when they are auctioned by his son.

Group Captain Mike Stephens was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for carrying out one of the most incredible acts of bravery during the war when his plane was badly damaged and on fire.

With injuries to both feet and much of his engine and half his cockpit shot away, he was preparing to leap from the burning wreckage.

But when the Luftwaffe pilot who had attacked him flew on ahead, he calmly climbed back inside his Hurricane fighter-bomber and shot the enemy Messerschmitt down.

It was only then that he jumped to safety and by that stage he was on fire himself.

He beat the flames out as he parachuted to the ground before landing just 300 yards from the German front line.

He hobbled towards friendly lines in the Western Desert before being picked up by Polish troops.

The action, in December 1941 over Acroma, Libya, was one of many acts of heroism carried out by the 'ace' who bagged an estimated 22 enemy craft during the war.

The episode for which Grp Cpt Stephens received the DSO was identical to one carried out by legendary Wing Commander Eric Nicolson, who received the Victoria Cross for it.

As well as the DSO, he won the Distinguished Flying Cross with two bars.

The distinguished pilot died in 2004 aged 84, and now his medals and other mementos are set to go under the hammer. His log book, photographs and a flying helmet with oxygen mask are among the other items set to be sold off.

They are expected to sell for £50,000 at the Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London.

Grp Cpt Stephens’ war record is among the finest in the RAF - and he ranks among the top dozen pilots for skills, but the speed with which he achieved them is astonishing.

His career was also unique because he was admitted to three informal RAF ‘clubs’ for wartime pilots.

They were the Caterpillar Club, for those who baled out with a parachute; the Goldfish Club, for those who baled out into water; and the Flying Boot Club, for those who came down in the desert and had to walk to friendly lines.

David Erskine-Hill, of Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'The remarkable wartime career of Mike Stephens epitomises the sustained gallantry displayed by the young pilots of Fighter Command.

'It was a career encompassing several hundred combat sorties and the award of four decorations for gallantry - only 15 airmen received the combination of a Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross with 2 Bars in the 1939-45 War.

'A fighter ace three times over and, on account of having to take to his parachute on two occasions, once over water, he was also a member of the Caterpillar, Flying Boot and Goldfish Clubs.

'Most notable of his wartime combats was the occasion on which he was wounded when his Hurricane was set ablaze by an attacking Messerschmitt 109 over the Western Desert - as he was in the process of baling out his adversary overshot his crippled aircraft.

'So Stephens regained his cockpit and shot it down, before taking to his parachute in burning overalls, a remarkable act of gallantry witnessed by Polish troops on the ground.

'A little over a year earlier, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Flight Lieutenant Nicolson had been awarded the VC for an identical act of bravery, though on this occasion Stephens was rewarded with an immediate DSO. He was just 22 years of age.'

Grp Cpt Stephens graduated from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, in 1939 and was posted to France where he was quickly in the thick of the action, shooting down enemy planes.

Returning from his final sortie in France he had six inches shot off one of his propeller blades but landed the unsteady machine at the airfield.

He was told that he couldn’t take off with the propeller damage and the plane would have to be destroyed.

But the pilot had six inches taken off the other end of the propeller and made it back to Britain.

Grp Cpt Stephens then went to Turkey and north Africa where he continued to shoot down enemy planes and survive close shaves himself.

In October 1942 he volunteered to go to Malta and remained lethal in the skies but came close to death.

He wrote in his logbook: 'Squirting 109 good and proper, got him smoking when a Spit (Stead) pulled up in front of me, so had to stop. Shot the port wing off another at 7,000, then later was bounced by a 109 who damaged my engine.

'Flew on a little way and then had to bale out. Trouble with dinghy, picked up after 3 hours. Moral - know your dinghy drill!'

What he didn’t add was that the dingy operation was made difficult because he kept his left hand in the air throughout because he was wearing a watch his parents had bought him and didn’t want to break it.

In May 1943 Stephens was awarded his third DFC and returned home and saw no further action.

He retired from the RAF in 1960 and worked in the aero-engines division of Rolls-Royce in Paris.

He retired with his late wife Violet to the south of France before they returned to live out their days in Britain.

The auction takes place on June 27-28.
