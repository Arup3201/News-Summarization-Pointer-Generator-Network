A 15-year-old grammar school pupil threw herself in front of a train after sending a text to her friend to say 'I'm sorry, I love you,' an inquest heard.

Jade Emily Kosanlavit, from the Wirral, Merseyside, had been receiving treatment for depression for two months following a previous suicide attempt when she jumped in front of a train just minutes from her family home.

The Wirral Grammar School for Girls' student, who was described by her teachers as a 'talented and hardworking pupil', died just before 10.30am on November 10 last year.

An inquest into her death at the Gerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool yesterday heard from British Transport Police officers who described seeing the schoolgirl running towards an oncoming  train.

The driver applied the emergency brake but it took 40 yards for the train to stop, the coroner heard.

The teenager suffered multiple injuries, including spinal fractures, and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The talented schoolgirl's mother, Wanpen, arrived at the station a short time after the incident, having heard the tragic news, and confirmed it was her daughter.

A mobile phone and handwritten note were found in Jade's pocket.

Details of the note's contents were not read out in court as to preserve Jade's privacy but British Transport Police said it expressed her wish to die.

A text message sent to her friend at 10.12am - about 10 minutes prior to her death - said: 'I'm sorry it has to end this way, I love you'.

The court heard that Jade had been prescribed  a form of antidepressants following an earlier incident on September 30 last year.

Concerns were raised by her family about the medication, which has been linked to suicides in the past, but Mr Rebello said he could not say if Jade's death would have happened had she not been taking them.

He added that he was satisfied the medication was prescribed in accordance with what is expected in child and adolescent psychiatry across England.

Mr Rebello said notes and drawings by Jade were 'poignant' and difficult reading.

He said the investigation goes far broader than what would be appropriate to share in court, adding that Jade's wishes for privacy should be respected.

He said: 'What happened to Jade is very difficult to get your head around - this very young life ending in this way.

'Jade suffered from a mental health depressive illness which had manifestations of intentional self-harm. She had been prescribed [anti-depressants] and supportive therapy. 

'I am satisfied that Jade intentionally took her own life while suffering from a depressive illness.'

Mr Rebello said it was important that Jade be remembered for who she was and not to let her tragic death 'overshadow the beauty of her life'.

Jade, a Year 11 pupil at Wirral Grammar School for Girls (pictured), was described as 'hardworking and talented'. The school said she had a strong friendship group and would be 'remembered as a gifted musician'

Following the inquest, John Johnson - Jade's mother's former partner - said: 'I absolutely adored her, I loved her so much and was so proud of her.

'I brought her up like she was my daughter, I just hope she rests in peace now.'

Following Jade's death, teachers and friends from Wirral Grammar School for Girls paid tribute to popular student.

Headteacher Elaine Cogan said: 'It is with great regret and sadness that we learned of Jade's death, she was a talented and hardworking pupil at the school.

'Jade was an articulate and gifted Year 11 pupil, popular with both pupils' and staff alike. Jade had a strong friendship group at school and received strong and unwavering support at home.

'She had a great love of music and will be particularly remembered as a gifted musician.

'Jade was an accomplished player of three instruments, took an active role in school recitals and music evenings, and recently toured Austria to perform with music department.

'There is a strong sense of loss across the whole school.'
