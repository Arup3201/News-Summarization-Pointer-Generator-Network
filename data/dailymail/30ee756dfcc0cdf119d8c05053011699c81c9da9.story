It may not be very politically correct, but a Melbourne company scared the daylights out of their counterparts in Los Angeles during a Skype conference call by making it sound as if their office was under an air attack as sirens blared in the background. 

After the LA office of Luma Pictures pranked their Melbourne office by pretending to be in the middle of an earthquake during a Skype call, their Australian co-workers in Melbourne decided to retaliate by acting out an air raid during one of their regularly scheduled digital meetings.

'We’re a VFX studio that works a lot over Skype giving notes and reviews due to the geographical location and the time difference,' a spokeswoman for Luma Pictures in Melbourne said. 

It seems like just another day at work in the Luma Pictures office in Melbourne. But suddenly air sirens can be heard

'The Melbourne team decided to pull the prank the very next day - not much preparation involved. Just finding a sound recording of an air raid signal and having everyone in the studio in Melbourne in on the prank.' 

'This is our retaliation, exacted the very next day,' a message read on the video before the mayhem took place.

 'All sound is exactly as recorded and would've been heard on Skype. Nothing has been altered.'

The scene shows staff from each company having a Skype conversation before air raid sirens start blasting out in the background.

It takes a few seconds for the workers in Luma's LA office to latch on to what is happening, but their puzzlement soon turns to outright fear as screams can be heard and the camera being used in the Skype call is knocked over.

'What the f***!?' one shocked member of staff says, while another grabs his phone and races from the room.  

Staff in Luma's LA office are soon reaching for their iPhones, frantically calling and texting to try and find out what was going on.

Going by their reactions it's likely that staff members in LA thought they were witnessing a terrorist attack, which heightened the tension even more.

However, after a few minutes of pandemonium calm was restored as the Melbourne office workers revealed it was just a prank to the obvious relief of those who had witnessed it all in Luma's LA office.

They even proved to be good sports and gave a round of applause at the end for being duped so successfully.
