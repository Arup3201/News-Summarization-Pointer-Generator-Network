British expats in South Sudan have described their daring rescue by RAF pilots as the African nation teeters on the brink of civil war.

Hundreds of Brits packed onto the runway at Juba airport desperately waiting for the C17 Globemaster to spirit them to safety while the distant sound of gunfire grew louder.

But minutes before the 266-tonne plane was due to arrive, a Sudanese passenger jet crash landed on the tarmac making it impossible far any other plane to touch down.

Dave 
Stanley, who was waiting for evacuation, said the nose undercarriage of 
the Boeing 737 appeared to have collapsed with the sound of an explosion
 as it landed completely blocking their only escape route.

Stricken: The South Sudanese Boeing 747, owned by Nova Air, crash landed on the runway blocking the British RAF Globemaster from landing

Relief: Hundreds of British expats packed onto the plane after the daring landing as they fled the country that sits on the brink of all-out civil war

Above them circled the Globemaster, which had completed a nine-hour, 3,500-mile journey from Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire, as air chiefs in Britain prepared to call off the mission and try again tomorrow.

But by a stroke of luck, a crane belonging to the United Nation happened to have been left in a nearby yard and
 the Sudanese jet was eventually towed out of the way, allowing the 
pilot of the Globemaster to make what the Ministry of Defence 
described as a 'daring, precision landing' on the cleared runway.

Globemaster: The C17 (pictured) is designed to carry out high-angle, steep approaches at relatively slow speeds, which allows it to operate into small airfields with short, narrow runways in difficult conditions

Mr
 Stanley, from Ashton in Kent, told Radio 4's Today programme that
 until Sunday, Juba had seemed calm with 'no warning of any trouble'. 
But on Monday morning, he was told not to leave his hotel.

'We
 were hearing gunshots,' he said. 'But things really picked up quite dramatically 
after about 9 o'clock in the morning when there were gun battles pretty 
much all around Juba, as best we could tell.

'There
 was shooting close to the hotel and it was actually closer the 
following day, but we couldn't tell who it was. We were told it was 
government soldiers fighting rebels or insurgents, whatever you want to 
call them.'

Of the rescue, he added: 'It was 
chaotic, because we arrived at the airport before 10 o'clock in the 
morning and we had to wait to try to find out what was happening.

'One
 of the Sudanese airlines, Nova Air, came in with a flight - it may well
 have been a charter flight for evacuation - and on landing we heard an 
explosion and we subsequently saw the aircraft and the front landing 
gear had collapsed. Whether a tyre had burst or whether it was the 
collapse of the landing kit I don't know, but it left the Boeing 737 
stuck in the middle of the runway.

Fears: As the British expats waited for the C17 Globemaster to spirit them to safety, the distant sound of gunfire echoed from the streets of Juba, growing louder

Power struggle: On Sunday President Salva Kiir (pictured) said that troops loyal to his ousted Vice President Riek Machar opened fire on a government meeting in an attempted coup

'We
 were told that the RAF plane was going to do a fly-past to look at the 
runway. Obviously their intention was to see if they could land on what 
remained of the runway. They did that and decided that they couldn't 
land, in fact. Then there was an announcement on the ground that the 
flight was going to be delayed until the next day, which caused some 
other problems.

'But at that
 point, while the aircraft was still there, they managed to find a crane
 from the UN and move the damaged aircraft off the runway. Fortunately, 
the RAF plane was still circling and was able to land very quickly.'

Dangers: US President Barack Obama has warned that South Sudan's 'great progress' towards breaking the cycle of violence in the country could be undone by this latest spate of fighting

The
 commanding officer of the RAF's 99 Squadron, Wing Commander Stuart 
Lindsell, said: 'We practise short landings in training but getting down
 on a runway with a crashed aircraft taking up a large part of it would 
really concentrate the mind and is way outside what we would normally 
expect.

'I think it's fair 
to say that this C17 captain and his crew have had one of the toughest 
days anyone on this squadron has had since we were stood up 12 years 
ago. It's not just the air crew but the RAF regiment who provided 
protection on the ground, the movers who helped get the passengers on 
board, the medics and the engineers - all of them have all performed 
brilliantly and I'm extremely proud of them.'

On
 board the RAF aircraft were medics, force protection and air movements 
personnel, and Foreign Office officials whose job was to assist people 
wanting to leave the country. Some 182 Britons and Commonwealth and EU 
citizens were evacuated to Entebbe, 350 miles away in neighbouring 
Uganda, but some had to leave their luggage behind at the airport.

'They
 told us that normally on one of these RAF C17 transporters they can 
take 132 passengers,' said Mr Stanley. 'In the end they just filled it 
up as much as they could. People had to leave their luggage pretty much 
on the runway at Juba airport and they put on everybody they could. The 
final number was 182, which they said was a record for this kind of 
operation.'

Since the fighting started Kiir has imposed a night time curfew and has arrested ten former ministers

The 
C17 is designed to carry out high-angle, steep approaches at relatively 
slow speeds, which allows it to operate into small airfields with short,
 narrow runways in difficult conditions. Within the last year it has 
used these capabilities delivering aid to typhoon victims in the 
Philippines and transporting military equipment to Mali and the Central 
African Republic.

Fighting has 
spread through the newly formed East African state, which gained its 
independence in 2011, following a reported coup attempt in the capital 
at the weekend.

The conflict in South Sudan began on Sunday when 
troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire 
at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir (pictured) from
 power.

Machar was sacked 
along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he 
was going to contest the 2015 general election.

Fears that fighting could spread into 
all-out civil war stem from the fact that Kiir is from the minority 
Dinka ethnic group, while Machar is a Nuer.

Around
 20,000 South Sudanese are now sheltering in UN camps, with the Akobo 
base being attacked yesterday with the possible death of civilians.

As
 well as drawing the attention of the US President, the conflict has 
also concerned neighbouring African states including Ethiopia, Kenya, 
Uganda who have sent mediators to attempt to find a resolution.

In
 a statement on Thursday, Kiir said he was willing to talk to anyone who
 would listen, but that he was unsure what the possible outcome could 
be.

The Foreign 
Office has strongly advised all remaining British nationals to leave the
 country amid fears it could prove difficult to get out if there is any 
further deterioration in the situation.

'The
 UK plans to send a second flight to South Sudan to evacuate British 
nationals who wish to leave from Juba airport on Friday December 20, 
following the evacuation of some British nationals on December 19,' a 
Foreign Office spokesman said.

Meanwhile,
 President Barack Obama has said South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' 
of civil war as conflict in the country enters its sixth day.

The
 US has sent 45 troops to the young state to protect its embassy in the 
capital of Juba, which has seen at least 500 people killed in violence 
so far.

In a statement the President said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people.

'In recent years, against great odds, 
South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of 
violence that characterized much of its history.

'Today,
 that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent 
fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its 
past.'

The State Department 
has issued a warning to US citizens in the country that they should 
leave immediately, and has evacuated all non-emergency government 
personnel.

Elsewhere South 
Sudan government officials have said that rebels are in control of the 
town of Bor, 125 miles north of the capital, and that the military is 
using heavy artillery.

British
 nationals seeking to leave South Sudan were urged to contact the 
Foreign Office in London for advice on +44 207 008 1500 or by emailing 
crisis@fco.gsi.gov.uk.
