A judge in Brazil has been suspended from a trial after being caught behind the wheel of the chief suspect's Porsche.

Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza was dismissed from the high-profile case of Eike Batista, a former multi-billionaire tycoon who is accused of insider trading.

Officials said Mr de Souza was deemed unfit to continue sitting the trial because he was caught driving home in Mr Batista's Porsche Cayenne, estimated to be worth £100,000.

Luxury: Judge de Souza was caught behind the wheel of the £100,000 Porsche Cayenne - similar to the one pictured - that he had ordered to be seized from former billionaire Eike Batista 

The judge claimed that police had no appropriate place to park the car - which was confiscated after an order that he issued - so he decided it was for the best if he took it home for safe keeping.

Mr de Souza's decisions in the case have now been annulled, meaning a retrial is now required.

A new judge is now expected to be appointed in the case, which began last November.

Mr Batista was once Brazil's richest person, with an estimated £20 billion fortune.

He is accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies. 

The 58-year-old made his fortune in mining, oil and gas exploration. He was listed as the seventh wealthiest person in the world as recently as 2012.

He has denied any wrongdoing at the case being heard in Rio de Janeiro. If convicted, he faces up to 13 years in prison.

Last month, police seized 11 vehicles, including a Lamborghini Aventador as well as the Porsche, from Mr. Batista’s homes. 

They also removed expensive jewellery, a grand piano and a fake Fabergé egg as guarantees to repay investors if the entrepreneur is eventually found guilty.

The cars were to be sold at auction and the proceeds held by a third-party until the conclusion of the trial, an action which is allowed under Brazilian law.

The piano, which was being kept at the apartment of one of Mr de Souza’s neighbours, along with one of the seized cars have been returned to Mr Batista, said a court spokesperson.
