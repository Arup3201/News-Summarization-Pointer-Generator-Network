A Tory MP’s housekeeper has spoken of her horror as she saw her gentle pet labrador savagely attacked by a pack of 10 vicious hounds at her employer's orchard. 

Grandmother Debbie Bower, who works at the Somerset home of MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, was terrified that Dozer had died from his injuries during the horrific 25-minute ordeal.

He was mauled so viciously, that he was minutes away from death and only just pulled through a three-and-a-half hour operation to save his life.

Vicious attack: Dozer, seen here immediately after the brutal attack, was mauled so viciously, that he was minutes away from death and only just pulled through a three-and-a-half hour operation to save his life

Terrifying experience: Dozer, had been playing in the garden with his owner's grandchildren, when the animals, which weren't on leads, charged towards Ms Bower's grandson before attacking him for 25 minutes

Now Ms Bower, 46, is calling for a change in the law to make dog-on-dog attacks illegal and wants to enable dog owners to be punished if their pets attack other animals.

Her employer, Mr Rees-Mogg is backing her case and has pledged to raise the issue in Parliament if Ms Bower raises 1,000 signatures on a petition outlining her proposals.

The bloody attack took place on March 18 at the constituency home of Mr Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset, in West Harptree, Somerset.

Dozer, a six-year-old labrador, had been playing in the garden with Ms Bower’s grandchildren when a pack of 10 dogs, which were being walked by a local man, jumped over the garden fence from a public footpath, which runs alongside Mr Rees-Mogg's land.

Campaign: His owner Debbie Bower, is now calling for a change in the law to make dog-on-dog attacks illegal and enable dog owners to be punished if their pets attack other animals

Recuperating: Dozer is still recovering from his ordeal and Ms Bower said 'We have to go into the garden with Dozer now because we're scared it could happen again'

Made up of Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Jack Russells and Whippets, the pack - none of which were on leads - charged towards Ms Bower’s grandson before cornering the labrador in a prolonged attack that lasted nearly half an hour.

Dozer was left with such horrific injuries that Ms Bower was sure her beloved pet had been killed.

Support: The bloody attack took place at the constituency home of Mr Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset - he has pledged to raise the issue in Parliament enough petition signatures

She said: 'His leg was bitten down to the bone, he had bites all over his head - he is lucky to be alive, I thought he was dead.

'His instincts kicked in and he played dead, I think that is the only thing that saved him. He had to undergo a three-and-a-half hour operation under anaesthetic.

'The dogs should have been kept on a lead. One of the dogs ran at my grandson first before going at Dozer - my grandchildren were hysterical and terrified.

She said that although the owner of the vicious dogs did try to intervene, he should not have been walking 10 dogs at one time, without them all being on a lead.

'It’s not the first time these dogs have attacked.I saw a woman walking her dog with a pitchfork in fear of them. People aren’t feeling safe because of the animals,' she added.

She said that she now has to accompany Dozer into the garden because "we’re scared it could happen again."

Mr
Rees-Mogg, who was elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, has 
spoken of his shock.

He said: 'The event happened in my garden and I was shocked and very concerned about it. My children play in that garden.

Investigation: Avon and Somerset Police are investigating Ms Bower's complaint, but as yet no charges have been brought against the owner of the dogs

'The owner of the dogs has expressed his concern at the event and he has recognised his responsibility. He says he will now walk his animals on a lead.

'It is important dog owners keep their dog under control and take responsibility for the way they behave.

'The Dangerous Dogs Act deals with dogs who are a risk to people but I think owners have a duty of care towards other dogs too.

'If Deborah gets a petition signed, I will present it in Parliament.'

Avon
and Somerset Police are investigating Ms Bower’s complaint, but as yet 
no charges have been brought against the owner of the dogs.
