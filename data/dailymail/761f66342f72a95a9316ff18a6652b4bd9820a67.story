Warning: Planning minister Nick Boles has said that the amount of developed land may increase by a third to ease the housing crisis

Up to two million acres of green fields may have to be sacrificed for housing, the planning minister warned last night.

In comments that will alarm conservationists, Nick Boles said the amount of developed land may have to increase by up to a third to tackle the growing housing crisis.

He told BBC Two’s Newsnight that ministers would protect the Green Belt - but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing.

And he hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development.

‘We’re going to protect the Green Belt but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land,’

Mr Boles said: ‘In the UK and England at the moment we’ve got about nine per cent of land developed. All we need to do is build on another two to three per cent of land and we’ll have solved a housing problem.’

The UK land mass covers about 60 million acres. Using another three per cent for housing would mean concreting over 1.8 million acres of undeveloped land.

Mr Boles’s figures suggest that tackling the housing shortage may mean building homes on every square inch of a county the size of Devon, which has 1.65 million acres.

Ministers believe the public would be more willing to accept new housing if people realised how much of the countryside remained undeveloped.

Sources at the Department for Communities and Local Government last night insisted that Mr Boles was ‘highlighting the scale of the problem’ rather than setting out a new Government strategy to concrete over the countryside.

But Mr Boles said some urban areas were 
more attractive than the countryside, adding: ‘The built environment can
be more beautiful than nature and we shouldn’t obsess about the fact 
that the only landscapes that are beautiful are open - sometimes 
buildings are better.’

Mr Boles also declared war on the ‘pig ugly’ housing estates built by some developers in recent decades. He said it was vital that future developments were more attractive to make them more acceptable to the public.

He will develop the theme further in a speech to planners tomorrow, telling them: ‘We are trapped in a vicious circle.

‘People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful. Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly.

‘Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality.

‘Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans.

And this drives the cost of development 
land up to stratospheric levels.’ Mr Boles singles out the Harrisons 
Wharf development in Purfleet, Essex, describing it as an ‘overbearing 
and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community
it borders’.

He urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development, but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.’

Mr Boles told Newsnight that the right to housing was ‘a basic moral right, like healthcare and education. There’s a right to a home with a little bit of ground around it to bring your family up in.’

He said he was determined to take on so-called Nimbys who oppose local development, saying: ‘It’s my job to make the arguments to these people that if they carry on writing letters their kids are never going to get a place with a garden to bring up their grand kids.

'I accept we haven’t been able to persuade them. I think it would be easier if we could persuade them that the new development would be beautiful.’

He urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development, but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.’
