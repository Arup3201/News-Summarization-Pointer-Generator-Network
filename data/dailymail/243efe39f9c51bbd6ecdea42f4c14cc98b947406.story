Seeking to ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Barack Obama said the United States levied news sanctions on Monday on Russian individuals and companies in retaliation for Moscow's alleged provocations in Ukraine.

Targets of the sanctions include Russian government officials and high-technology exports to Russia's defense industry.

'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' Obama said. 'The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.'

President Barack Obama announced on Monday that the United States was levying news sanctions on Russian individuals and companies in retaliation for alleged the country's alleged provocations in Ukraine

In a statement sent to reporters on Monday morning, the White House clarified that the Department of the Treasury would be imposing sanctions on seven Russian government officials, 'including two members of President Putinâ€™s inner circle.' These officials will have their U.S. visas banned and their assets frozen.

Meanwhile, 17 companies linked to Putin will have their assets frozen. Of those 17 companies, Treasury will further sanction 13 by disallowing exports from the U.S. to those companies.

The statement did neither specified which government officials nor Russian companies would be sanctioned.

The Departments of Commerce and State will also begin denying export applications for any 'high-technology items that could contribute to Russiaâ€™s military capabilities.' Existing export licenses in that category will be revoked, according to the White House's statement.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the U.S. is prepared to 'impose still greater costs on Russia if the Russian leadership continues these provocations.'

Future sanctions could affect individuals and businesses working in Russia's financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering and defense industries.

In a statement to CNN, Russia's deputy minister 
for foreign relations Sergey Ryabkov called the sanctions 'meaningless, shameful, and disgusting.' 

'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' Obama said. 'The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.'

Obama announced the sanctions during a news conference in the Philippines, his final stop on a four-country Asia swing. The president has been building a case for this round of penalties throughout his trip, both in his public comments and in private conversations with European leaders.

The new sanctions are intended to build on earlier U.S. and European visa bans and asset freezes imposed on Russian officials, including many in Putin's inner circle, after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine last month.

White House officials say they decided last week to impose additional penalties after determining that Russia had not lived up to its commitments under a fragile diplomatic accord aimed at easing the crisis in Ukraine.

But the U.S. held off on implementing the sanctions in order to coordinate its actions with the European Union, which could also announce new penalties as early as Monday.

The failed diplomatic agreement reached in Geneva just over a week ago called on the Kremlin to use its influence to get pro-Russian insurgents to leave the government buildings they have occupied in eastern Ukraine.

But those forces have not only balked at leaving those buildings, but have also stepped up their provocations, including capturing European military observers who were paraded by the militants before the media Sunday.

Despite the deteriorating situation, Obama said Russia still has the opportunity to resolve the Ukraine crisis through a diplomatic path. But he voiced pessimism about whether the new sanctions package would be enough to change Putin's calculus.

'We don't yet know whether it's going to work,' he said.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters during her daily 
briefing on Monday that the U.S. had not seen any signs from Russia that it would begin abiding by the Geneva agreement.

The EU is Russia's biggest trading partner, giving it much 
greater economic leverage over Moscow than the U.S. has. However, the EU
 treads more carefully in imposing sanctions since Russia is also one of
 its biggest oil and gas suppliers.

European diplomats were set to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss slapping asset freezes and travel bans on more officials associated with Russia's actions on Ukraine.

The EU has so far sanctioned 33 individuals over the Crimea annexation.

The EU was likely to add another 15 individuals to its sanctions list at the meeting and discuss further steps, a diplomat from a major EU country said.

The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official decision had not yet been announced, declined to elaborate on which officials would be targeted.
