Defence officials have secretly started examining plans to move Britain’s nuclear-armed submarines from Scotland to Wales, the Daily Mail can reveal.

The Scottish Nationalists, on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at May’s General Election, insist they want the Trident fleet removed from its base on the west coast of Scotland.

David Cameron refused to allow any contingency planning for Scottish independence to take place before last September’s referendum, not wanting to give the impression that the UK Government was even contemplating defeat.

As polls revealed the SNP may have the power of king-maker after the general election, Parliament has begun drawing up plans to move the nuclear deterrent to Wales (pictured, HMS Vanguard at the Faslane base)

But now, despite the ‘no’ vote in the referendum, pollsters say the SNP is on course to win dozens of Commons seats and may hold the balance of power at Westminster after the Election. 

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s new First Minister, has made scrapping Trident a condition of entering any sort of power-sharing deal with Labour. 

The Ministry of Defence insists it has no intention of moving the nuclear deterrent from the Faslane naval base on the River Clyde and is committed to maintaining a continuous, submarine-based missile system to protect the UK.

But sources have disclosed that work has now begun on the practicalities of shifting Britain’s nuclear defence systems to Pembrokeshire, should that prove necessary. 

Labour’s First Minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, is understood to have indicated he would be prepared to see Trident relocated to Milford Haven, a natural deep water port.

Britain has four Royal Navy Vanguard submarines, based at Faslane, which can deploy Trident ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.

One well-placed source said political leaders in Wales were keen for the Ministry of Defence to ‘look at Welsh sites – not just Milford Haven’.

The source said it would be negligent not to prepare for all contingencies, given the SNP surge in Scotland and the possibility of the party holding the balance of power.

Mr Cameron said this week that the prospect of a Labour government being ‘held hostage’ by Scotland’s former First Minister Alex Salmond, who is running for a Westminster seat, was ‘genuinely frightening’.

Ed Miliband has been forced to restate his commitment to replacing Britain’s nuclear weapons, after failing to vote against an SNP Commons motion calling for Trident to be scrapped last week.

The Labour leader’s spokesman said: ‘Our position on Trident is clear and unchanged. 

'Labour believes Britain should be leading international efforts for multilateral nuclear disarmament while maintaining a minimum, credible independent nuclear deterrent.’

However, one pro-nuclear Labour MP accused Mr Miliband of ‘trying to be cute’, adding: ‘He wants to carve a different position to that of the Tories but it’s a dangerous game.’

The SNP yesterday welcomed a YouGov poll showing that, when ‘don’t knows’ are removed, 53 per cent of people in Scotland agree that the UK should give up nuclear weapons.

Across the UK, however, only 25 per cent of voters want Britain to give up Trident when it reaches the end of its useful life in 13 years. 

British fighter planes could return to Afghanistan to tackle the Taliban months after the last troops were withdrawn.

Defence chiefs are examining plans to send a squadron of Tornados to bomb militants following a series of major Taliban attacks. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are looking at sending Tornados back.’

But resuming combat operations would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years of fighting.

Tornados could return to Afghanistan in the wake of several Taliban attacks, but resuming strikes would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years in the country

As British soldiers pulled out late last year, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said they would not go back ‘under any circumstances’. 

But despite his confidence, 2014 was the deadliest year of the conflict, with the Afghans losing more than 4,500 men – more than Nato forces lost in 13 years.

However, the country is still said to be three years away from having an air force.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We do not expect to send fighter jets to Afghanistan. There is nothing in train on this.’
