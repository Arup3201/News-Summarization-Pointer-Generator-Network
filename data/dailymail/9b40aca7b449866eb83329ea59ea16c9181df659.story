Barcelona will look to continue their challenge for the La Liga title when they welcome Rayo Vallecano to the Nou Camp on Sunday, but have to make do without Neymar.

Neymar trained on Saturday morning with his team-mates ahead of their match against mid-table Vallecano as manager Luis Enrique looks to put pressure on leaders Real Madrid.

But the Brazilian is suspended  after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season against Granada at the end of February, and is set to be replaced by 27-year-old forward Pedro.

Neymar will be a miss after his two goals against Villarreal on Wednesday helped Barca to a 3-1 win and 6-2 victory on aggregate in the Copa del Rey semi-final.

Pedro has recently been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp at the end of the season, but Enrique insists he still has a role to play at Barcelona.

'He is a top player with great individual ability to score goals and open up the opposition,' Enrique told a press conference. 'He is also a team player and works hard. He would like to have more chances but he has always helped us when he has played.' 

Carlo Ancelotti's Real can go five points clear at the top with a win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening, but it may only be temporary until Barca's game the morning after.
