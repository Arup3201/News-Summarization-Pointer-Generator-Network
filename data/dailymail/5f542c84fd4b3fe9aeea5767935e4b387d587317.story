A Texas teacher has resigned after allegations that he recited a sexually explicit poem to freshman high school students during class.

The poem references the biblical story of Adam and Eve and includes sexual innuendos. It was read to students at Nederland High School in Nederland, 80 miles east of Houston.

The teacher's name has not been released by officials from the Nederland Independent School District, and his resignation was accepted Friday morning by the superintendent.

Angry parents and students in the freshman class said they made complaints about the teacher, according to 12NewsNow.

'They're there to get an education. This is not educating them,' said parent Jerry Windham.

He added: 'Children already know enough without him needing to push it. It's just not right.' 

Steven Beagle, the principal of Nederland High School, said the teacher used inappropriate language in class and that district officials first learned of the incident on Wednesday

Parent Roseanne Lalko said the teacher does not need to teach anymore or ever.

She said: 'It's awful what's happening with the morals.'

Steven Beagle, the principal of Nederland High School, said the teacher used inappropriate language in class and that district officials first learned of the incident on Wednesday.

He said that immediately after they learned of the incident, he conducted a thorough investigation of the complaint along with other administrative staff, according to Beaumont Enterprise.

Beagle also said that he assures parents that the district takes complaints of this nature very seriously. 

 

In the Garden of Eden,

As everyone knows,

Lives Adam and Eve,

Without any clothes.

 

In this garden,

Were two little leaves,

One covered Adam's,

One covered Eve's.

 

As the story goes on,

Never the less to say,

The wind came along,

And blew the leaves away.

 

At the sight,

Adam did stare,

There was Eve's treasure,

All covered with hair.

 

And wonder came,

Under Eve's eyes,

As Adam's thing,

Started to rise.

 

They found a spot,

That suited them best,

A nice big tree,

Where they began to rest.

 Her legs spread wider,

And wider apart,

While thrill after thrill,

Came into her heart.

 

The head of Adam's thing,

Peeked into the hole,

And filled her with passion,

Beyond her control.

 

Backward and forward,

His thing did slide,

And Eve's treasure,

Was all wet inside.

 

The joy was good,

She wouldn't let loose,

Until Adam's thing,

Was all out of juice.

 

Then down through the years,

People did screw,

And now it is time,

For me and you.

 

So pull down your pants,

And lay in the grass,

Cause I'm in the mood,

For a piece of that ASS!
