For men who love to sniff out a bargain while keeping the woman in their life happy, this may seem like the perfect Christmas gift.

A £4 Lidl perfume smells almost exactly the same as a £70 scent from Chanel, according to a money-saving expert.

But for those considering smuggling the cut-price bottle into their other half's Christmas stocking, beware – the plain packaging could prove something of a giveaway.

Bargain expert Martin Lewis revealed Lidl's Suddenly Madame Glamour is virtually indistinguishable from Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle.

But while the more expensive scent is endorsed by actress Keira Knightley and housed in a luxurious box, its budget alternative comes in a rather less inspiring plain bottle.

Mr Lewis said there were many other 'smell-alike' perfumes on the market that simply reeked of luxury but would not break the bank.

At first sniff, for example, Next's £14 Just Pink is almost identical to the £50 Ralph Lauren Romance.

In an interview with the Radio Times, Mr Lewis warned: 'When you buy perfumes and aftershaves, a lot of the cost goes into the branding and the marketing.

'However there are a number of 'smell-alikes' out there. We've done tests and most people can't tell the difference. It's important to be clear we're not talking about buying knock-off copies here.'

Mr Lewis also urged families trying to cut down their spending this Christmas to avoid giving unnecessary gifts. 'Many people hate the ever-growing, creeping list of presents,' he said.

'We do tit-for-tat giving, and the end result is I buy you one, and you buy me one. We end up giving stuff that people will never use.

'Say to people, 'I won't buy one for you, don't buy one for me'. Keep your gifts for children and very close family.'

Lidl and Next are not the only high street retailers to sell budget perfumes with a whiff of luxury. Superdrug launched a range in September last year with prices starting at £4.

Simon Comins, its buying director, said: 'Fragrance doesn't have to cost the earth.

'Of course many people love the sense of luxury that comes with wearing a designer perfume, but a savvy shopper is happy to wear an amazing fragrance that doesn't come with the designer bottle and luxury price tag.'
