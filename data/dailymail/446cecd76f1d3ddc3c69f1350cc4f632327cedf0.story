He has been the star of the Royal Tour Down Under so far, but Prince George may soon have to share the spotlight with a sibling, according to the Duke of Cambridge.

In an unguarded comment on a walkabout in the small New Zealand town of Cambridge, William dropped the biggest hint yet that he and Kate plan to extend their family.

On day six of their tour, they braved drizzly conditions to greet well-wishers including Briton Cynthia Read, who was commissioned by the New Zealand government to make a merino wool shawl for George. The Duke thanked Mrs Read for the gift before telling her: ‘You might have to make another one soon!’

Mrs Read, who emigrated from Newcastle-upon-Tyne eight years ago with her husband Ken, said: ‘The way William said it was like he was  letting me in on a secret.’

Given her history of severe morning sickness – Kate spent three days in hospital while carrying George – it is likely the Duchess would be advised not to fly or undertake an arduous tour while in the early stages of a second pregnancy.

However, Royal insiders point out that George was conceived just weeks after the couple returned from their Far East tour in September 2012, and it is possible they plan to start trying for another child once they have finished this trip.  

William and Kate arrived in Dunedin this morning as their tour of New Zealand continues. Despite their hectic schedule the couple seem to be enjoying themselves

Certainly baby talk has dominated the tour, with eight-month-old George enjoying the same star billing as his parents – although he apparently refuses to eat his greens. The Duchess yesterday revealed she ‘had to mash up’ her son’s vegetables to  disguise them.

William and Kate’s decision to take George with them has given the world its first proper chance to see the Duchess as a busy mother. But it’s clear from the compassion she has demonstrated with other children that her maternal feelings extend beyond her own family.

She melted hearts at the Rainbow Place

Children’s Hospice in nearby Hamilton 
where she met Bailey Rupe, whose mother has terminal cancer. The 
Duchess sat down with Bailey, six, and asked: ‘How is mummy doing? Do 
you find it difficult sometimes? I’m sure you do but you’re a very brave
 girl.’

As The Mail on Sunday revealed last week the Duchess is on a crusade to turn the international spotlight on palliative care for sick children, so her hour-long visit to the Rainbow Centre was a crucial engagement in her tour diary. She has also been asked to become patron of a new hospice, Hummingbird House, which due to open in Queensland, Australia, this year.

During their trip to Hamilton, the couple also officially opened the National Cycling Centre at the Avantidrome. William played the role of starter for a race and grimaced as he fired a pistol to get the event under way. Tomorrow the couple will spend their first night away from George and fly to Dunedin for a church service before attending a rugby match. From Dunedin they will fly to Queenstown for a wine-tasting session at the Amisfield Winery, and enjoy a thrilling jet boat ride on the Shotover River. The couple have worked their magic throughout the trip, prompting New Zealand’s Olympic gold medal rower Hamish Bond to say in Hamilton: ‘We can relate to them and they can relate to us. They represent a new era of Royals.’

In demand: The Duchess acknowledges the crowds yesterday and bends down to listen to a well-wisher's soft toy
