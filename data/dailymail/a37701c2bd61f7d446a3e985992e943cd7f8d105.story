A grieving pensioner was ordered to pay a carer £3,500 for ‘unfair dismissal’ because he cut her hours when his wife died.

George Lomas, 77, was told he breached Jayne Wakefield’s contract by not giving notice that her hours would decrease after his wife Rose’s death.  Mrs Wakefield had cared for  Parkinson’s sufferer Mrs Lomas for five years, with her wages paid by the council.

When his wife died, Mr Lomas offered to pay the carer himself – for fewer hours than before – to help as he coped with his loss.  She sat next to the pensioner at Mrs Lomas’s funeral, holding his hand and wiping his tears.

But the very next day, she resigned by letter, demanding redundancy pay.

Grieving: Pensioner George Lomas, 77, has been forced to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to his carer who sued him for constructive dismissal when her hours were cut after the death of his wife Rose

Trusting: Mr Lomas said that wife Rose, who died earlier this year, would have been 'turning in her grave' if she had known about the request for money

Yesterday, the ‘devastated’ 
grandfather of one said: ‘How was I supposed to give her notice? You 
don’t have notice when your wife is going to die.

‘My wife would be heartbroken because she trusted Jayne. We never thought she would do that.

‘At Rose’s funeral, she was telling 
everyone she was going to look after me, then the next day she was 
asking for redundancy money.

‘It’s unreal – we treated her like a daughter and she has betrayed us.’

Mrs Wakefield, 55, took Mr Lomas to an employment tribunal.

A judge rejected her claim, but on 
appeal she was awarded £3,568, including redundancy pay and compensation
for constructive unfair dismissal and breach of contract.

Last night, her husband Leslie, 59, 
said: ‘She’s been given the redundancy money which she is entitled to 
and that’s the end of the story.

‘People die. Husbands die, children 
die, wives die – it happens, I’m afraid. Mr Lomas was Jayne’s employer, 
it is as simple as that. I don’t think it’s a large bill – he’s sitting 
on loads of premium bonds anyway.’

Even though Mrs Lomas’s care was 
funded by Cheshire East Council, Mr Lomas will have to pay the whole 
compensation sum from his own pocket. That is because he is legally 
classed as Mrs Wakefield’s employer after paying her privately for just a
few days after his wife’s death.

The retired accountant said he does not know how he will cope and accused the council of ‘washing their hands of the issue’.

Not responsible: Cheshire East Council said that as Mr Lomas was not in receipt of adult care services from the council it was not liable for claims made via the tribunal

He said: ‘I’m on a company and state pension, but I just haven’t got the money to pay for this.’

Mr Lomas said he offered to pay the 
carer for 16 hours a week, when she had previously put in 30 hours a 
week caring for Mrs Lomas.

But Mrs Wakefield told the tribunal in Birmingham that she quit because there was no written offer.

Mr Lomas added that the incident had taken its toll on him and he had since suffered a minor stroke.

He said: ‘It’s ruined my health. My doctor told me it has been brought on by the stress of this case.

‘To contact me the day after I lost my wife is disgusting.

‘And when she pushed a letter through the door saying she was suing me – my world fell apart.

‘I will never forgive her,’ he said, speaking from his home in Scholar Green, Cheshire.

Both Mr Lomas, and Ms Wakefield live in Scholar Green, Cheshire (pictured). Mrs Lomas's care had been paid for by East Cheshire Council, but these funds were stopped when she died

Mr Lomas started caring for his wife 
of 51 years, a retired quality controller, when she was diagnosed with 
Parkinson’s almost 25 years ago.

As her condition grew worse, Mrs Wakefield, a neighbour of the couple at the time, came in as a carer.

At first, the council paid Mrs Wakefield directly, but later Mr Lomas received a grant to cover the cost.

His son Adrian, managing director of a digital agency, said: ‘All this has really upset dad.

‘One day she was sitting in the front
row of the church holding dad’s hand at mum’s funeral, the next there’s
a letter pushed through his door.’

Entitled: Jayne Wakefield's husband Leslie said that the carer had been given the redundancy money she was entitled to

The 44-year-old said pensioners who pay for care should be careful.

‘Once the council stopped paying for 
care direct, people like Dad were made to employ people themselves and 
then pay them out of the money the council gave them,’ he said.

‘That means they have a responsibility for PAYE, holiday pay and even redundancy payments.

‘But no one made this clear to my father. He had never employed anybody in his life.

‘This has been a real kick in the 
teeth for all of us, especially dad. Legally I understand why the appeal
was upheld, but morally there’s something very wrong about this.’

A council spokesman said: ‘Mr Lomas has not been in receipt of adult care services from Cheshire East Council.

‘His care arrangements, therefore, 
were a private matter and the council is not liable for claims made via 
an employment tribunal.’

Mrs Wakefield was not available  for comment.
