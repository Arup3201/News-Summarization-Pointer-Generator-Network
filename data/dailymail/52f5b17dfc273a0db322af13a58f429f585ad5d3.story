A Sheriff's deputy has been killed after his cruiser was hit head-on by a woman who had just been released on parole for methamphetamine.

Jesse Valdez III, 32, a single father-of-one, was a couple of hours into the graveyard shift when his vehicle was hit by a Ford Explorer on the east side of Harris county, Texas. 

His vehicle was hit so hard it spun into a drainage ditch and was so badly damaged rescuers needed to cut him out of the wreckage. He died in hospital about an hour later.

Fallen hero: Sheriff's deputy Jesse Valdez III, a single father-of-one, was killed after his car was hit  a Ford Explorer driven by 29-year-old Kelly Jo Ivey who had  just been released on parole

The driver of the Explorer, 29-year-old Kelly Jo Ivey, was charged her with possession of a controlled substance after methamphetamine pills were found hidden in a perfume bottle.

She had a blood sample taken after officers reported signs of impairment at the scene.

Ivey had been released from jail on parole on October 2. 

She had been sentenced in March to two years for a methamphetamine charge. She has previous convictions for theft and forgery.

Authorities are awaiting the results of toxicology tests before determining whether any additional charges should be filed.

Deputy Valdez's cruiser was hit so hard it spun into a drainage ditch. Authorities needed use extraction tools to remove Valdez from the vehicle.

He was taken by Life Flight to the Memorial Hermann Hospital where he was pronounced dead at around 1am.

Ivey was taken by ambulance to the same hospital and was released that afternoon into the sheriff's office custody, authorities said. 

An unidentified man in the passenger seat of the Explorer was treated on scene. Authorities said he has not been charged at this time.

Last night Harris county Sheriff Adrian Garcia paid tribute to Deputy Valdez - an 11 year veteran and father to a 10-year-old boy.

He said: 'Today we mourn a comrade, a friend, a brother.

'There are many hearts grieving tonight and my heart is heavy for his family.'
