A man arrested in connection with the theft of Michael Schumacher's medical files has been found hanged in his prison cell.

The suspect, a helicopter rescue worker, was found dead on Wednesday, 24 hours after he was detained.

Schumacher's medical file, which held details of his surgical procedures following his skiing accident, were stolen and offered to the media for £40,000 in June.

Shock: The man arrested on suspicion of leaking Michael Schumacher's medical files has been found dead

Accident: Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a ski accident in the French Alps late last year

The seven-time Formula One champion suffered major head injuries sustained last December and he was kept in a medically-induced coma for six months.

From there he was transferred from Grenoble Hospital in France to Lausanne, Switzerland.

The man arrested worked for Rega, the helicopter company which dealt with Schumacher's transport from France to the University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud, 20 miles from the German's family home on the shore of Lake Geneva. He denied any wrongdoing.
