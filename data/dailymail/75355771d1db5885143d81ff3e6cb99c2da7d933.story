Enquiry: The new investigation into princess Diana's death found there was no evidence to support Soldier N's claims

Extraordinary claims that the SAS was involved in the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, were officially dismissed last night.

Scotland Yard said there was ‘no credible or relevant evidence’ that members of the elite unit were linked to the tragic car crash in Paris 16 years ago.

In a letter to the Queen and Prince Charles, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there were no facts to substantiate rumours of Special Forces involvement.

As a result, the criminal inquiry will not be reopened and the matter will not be referred back to coroner Lord Justice Baker, he said.

The decision will come as a relief to senior members of the Royal Household, who have been frustrated at the controversy surrounding the outlandish claims.

In August, police were passed material from an SAS sniper, known as Soldier N, via his former parents-in-law.

They said he claimed members of his regiment assassinated Diana seconds after her Mercedes smashed into an underpass pillar.

Seven detectives were given access to Special Forces Directorate records and took statements.

They liaised with colleagues in other forces as well as with the Royal Military Police and the Ministry of Defence.

In a letter to the Royal Household, the coroner and Mohammed Al Fayed – whose son Dodi also died in the crash – Mr Rowley said they found contradictions over whether the claims were or were not made against the SAS.

Credibility: Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there was no basis for a homicide investigation to be opened

In a copy of the letter passed to Sky 
News, he wrote: ‘The conclusion the investigative team has reached is 
that, whilst there is a possibility that the alleged comments in 
relation to the SAS’s involvement in the death may have been made, there
 is no credible or relevant evidence to support a theory that such 
claims had any basis in fact.

‘I am satisfied that there is no evidential basis upon which therefore to reopen any criminal homicide investigation.’

A
 summary of the Scotland Yard inquiry enclosed with the letter said the 
nature of the tragedy means ‘there will have been those who, for 
whatever motivation, will have sought to demonstrate particular inside 
knowledge, or to claim some form of kudos or recognition’.

Since
 the crash on August 31, 1997, millions of pounds have been spent on 
inquiries by Scotland Yard and French police and an inquest.

The inquest
 found that the blame lay with the negligent driving of drunken 
chauffeur Henri Paul, who also died, and the distraction caused by 
pursuing paparazzi.

But 
Diana’s death remains the subject of conspiracy theories. Some argue she
 was murdered because she had become a thorn in the side of the Royal 
Family.

Last night, Scotland
 Yard refused to release the letter or confirm the findings of its 
inquiry, which are due to be released today.
