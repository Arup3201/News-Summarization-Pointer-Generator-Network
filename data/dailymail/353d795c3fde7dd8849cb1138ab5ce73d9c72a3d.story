For the last couple of years, females have been performing increasingly better in exams than males.

But it now appears their success on paper may be affecting their love lives.

The latest Census results show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for women to find a man with the same level of education.

Sarasota, Florida, is now the worst in the country with 18 females college graduates to every male with a diploma aged under 35.

Seattle is the most balanced city, yet there are more than eight graduated women for every seven graduated men, The Atlantic reports.

These statistics are echoed, to a slightly lesser degree, across America. In 2011, 36.1 per cent of women aged between 15 and 19 had a degree compared to 28.4 per cent of men in the same age bracket.

The discrepancy is the worst between white men and women with  43 per cent of white women having at a bachelor's in 2011 compared to just 35.5 per cent of men.

The number of black men with a bachelor's in 2011 was 17 per cent compared to 22.9 per cent of black women.

Meanwhile, only nine per cent of Hispanic men had bachelor's compared to 16.8 per cent of women.

Jordan Weissmann, associate editor at The Atlantic, analysed the impact this will be having across the country.

He wrote: 'Of course, Sarasota is just an extreme example of what's true all over America. The number of college-educated women now far outstrips the number of college-educated men, which in turn has diminished their options in the dating pool.

'One of the great social narratives of the past half century is that Americans have been self-segregating into cultural and class enclaves, in part by marrying people more and more educationally like themselves.

'But that's not really the whole tale. As Stanford sociologist Michael Rosenfeld documented in a 2008 paper, contemporary women are less likely to marry a fellow bachelor's degree holder than they were in 1960, and about 11 percentage points less likely to than today's men.'

This explains why there is now far more competition for females to find a mate on the same educational scale as themselves.
