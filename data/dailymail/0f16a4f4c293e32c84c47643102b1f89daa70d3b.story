The Guinness International Champions Cup heads towards a conclusion this weekend as the eight teams involved play their last group fixtures.

Louis van Gaal's Manchester United take on Real Madrid in Michigan while Group A's other fixture sees Italian rivals Inter Milan and Roma go head to head in Philadelphia.

Over in Group B, leaders Liverpool face AC Milan in North Carolina in a repeat of the 2005 and 2007 Champions League finals in North Carolina, while Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City take on Olympiacos in Minnesota.

On tour: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are one win from the Guinness International Champions Cup final

On the march: United are top of Group A after beating Inter Milan on penalties at FedEx Field

All four games take place on Saturday and the winners of each group will meet in the final at Miami's Sun Life Stadium on Monday.

Despite the television coverage around the world, large crowds in big stadiums and the tournament format, this competition is just a part of new-season preparations for the eight European teams involved.

And while the prospect of a Liverpool-United showdown or a Manchester derby in Miami looms, new Old Trafford boss Van Gaal wouldn't mind a defeat by Real Madrid at 'The Big House' in Ann Arbor.

Rivals: Either Liverpool or Manchester City could face United in the final in Miami on Monday

Setting: The tournament has been played at some of America's best venues - including Yankee Stadium

Should United beat the Champions League winners, they will top Group A, face another long flight from the north America to the south east for the final, be forced to stay Stateside for a few more days, and play another match on this pre-season tour which Van Gaal has dismissed as a 'commercial activity'.

After two games, United sit top of Group A with five points. They were awarded three for their 3-2 win over Roma in Denver, and two for a penalty shoot-out victory against Inter at FedExField.

A draw will probably be good enough to see United into the final, but either Roma or Inter could still pip them to top spot in Group A.

Both Italian teams have three points, Roma through more conventional football methods with one win, 1-0 over Real Madrid, and one defeat, 3-2 by Manchester United. Inter, meanwhile, picked up two points after beating Real in a shootout, and one for a loss on penalties against United.

Effectively, United need two points to be certain of their place in the final, which means they could afford a draw against Real Madrid in Michigan so long as they win the penalty shootout.

Meanwhile, in Group B, only AC Milan are out of the running for a place in the final as Liverpool and Manchester City sit best placed to make the final.

Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side are top of the group with five points, three for their 1-0 win over Olympiacos in Chicago and two for their shootout win over City at Yankee Stadium.

But with City just one point behind with a much better goal difference, Liverpool need a win to guarantee themselves a place in the final.
