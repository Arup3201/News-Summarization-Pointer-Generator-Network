Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj continue to show the world they are not just teammates but also best mates.

The Manchester United and Belgium duo both posted pictures of themselves out at a restaurant on Monday night ahead of their game against Newcastle on Wednesday

Januzaj poses in the middle of Fellaini and a friend looking like somebody who failed to receive the memo about it being a Jackson 5 themed night.

The disco effect in the background adds to the theory, but Januzaj doesn’t seem to mind as they later pose on the dance floor with other friends.

United haven’t had too many reasons to have a song and dance this season so it seems they may be hitting the discotheques as another form of release.

However, victory against Newcastle on Wednesday would leave manager Louis van Gaal at least tapping his toes as they continue to fight for a Champions League spot this season.
