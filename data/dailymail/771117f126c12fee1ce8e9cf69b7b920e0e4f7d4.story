Lotus have claimed they are ready to return to the pinnacle of Formula One after enduring a season-to-forget in 2014. 

The Enstone-based team finished a miserable eighth in the constructors’ championship after accumulating just 10 points last term. 

But the team, who released, the first images of their new concept on Monday – the E23 Hybrid which will be powered by Mercedes – expect to be much more competitive this season.

Lotus are hugely optimistic that they will be in a position to improve on last year's miserable campaign 

‘The E23 Hybrid represents a massive step forward for us. It’s no secret that we struggled with last year’s car so we’ve targeted every area that caused us an issue,’ said the team’s technical director Nick Chester.

‘We’ve made strong progress in the wind tunnel as well as in areas such as packaging and cooling. We expect the E23 to perform far, far better than its predecessor. 

'In terms of what’s new, obviously a massive change for us is a new Power Unit supplier. We made this change as it looked and looks to be the one area of the car which could bring us the greatest performance gain. It’s not just performance, but reliability and driveability as well as packaging and cooling, too.

Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado will form Lotus' driver line-up for the second consecutive season 

Lotus' CEO Matthew Carter has said 'it is time to put the disappointment of last season behind us' 

'We know we’ve made a big step. We won’t know how our car will fare in relative terms until we’re out in action at a Grand Prix, but we certainly expect to be much more competitive than last year.'

Romain Grosjean and the much-maligned Pastor Maldondao will form Lotus’ driver line-up for a second consecutive season.

Briton’s reigning GP2 champion Jolyon Palmer was unveiled as their reserve driver earlier this month.

'As a team we are confident that the new car coupled with additions to the race team will enable a huge leap forward and we are full of optimism going into the new season, said the team’s CEO Matthew Carter.

'It is time to put the disappointment of last season behind us and benefit from 12 months of hard work; we are ready to return to our rightful place at the pinnacle of the sport.'
