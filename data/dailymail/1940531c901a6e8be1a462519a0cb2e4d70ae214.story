A loveable horse dedicates it's time to cheering people by giving them KISSES.

Scooby Boo visits hospitals, schools, rehab centres and retirement homes to give out kisses and cheer people up.

The 12-year-old therapy horse, who works in Tampa in Florida, USA, was discovered by owner Robin Bidwell, 54, on Craigslist four years ago.

Robin said the picture on the listing were low quality and when she came to pick him up she realised he'd been neglected for around two years.

Nursed back to full health, Robin then discovered Scooby's love for kissing people on the lips.

She said the horse loved their reactions to a slobbery kiss - as people would often giggle or smile after he had done so.

So Robin decided to teach Scooby how to kiss on demand and even built him his own kissing booth for charity events.

The money raised from the booth goes towards a children's cancer charity called CureSearch.

He's a lover! Robin says one of Scooby Boo's greatest traits is his trust in humans

The majority of the horse's time is spent making people feel better about themselves - such as helping students to de-stress during exam times and cheering up those in hospital.

Because the floors at places Scooby visits are slippery he wears a pair of fashionable trainers to stop him from slipping.

Scooby now averages between four and six therapy visits every week.

Before each visit, the horse is washed and groomed, which takes about an hour.

Robin believes his greatest traits are his playfulness, gentleness and how he shows a great deal of trust in humans when they are around him.

She said: 'We literally hadn't had Boo a month before I thought about doing therapy with him.

'Other people did it with dogs his size and bigger, so why not a horse? 

'After his first day in an assisted care facility, I knew he found his calling. 

'We have been visiting for about four years now and we average four to six visits weekly. 

'We visit hospitals, schools, rehabs, and many other facilities.

'He's a stallion so it is very unusual that he is so kind, playful and easy-going.'
