Fancy a cheeky beer? Pirulo Rojas, from Santiago, in Chile, can open a bottle of beer using just his backside

Friends and family call on him to perform his party piece and he laughs as he agrees. 

After the encouragement, the 31-year-old is seen inserting a bottle between his bum cheeks - with his jeans still on.

After closing his legs tightly and squeezing hard as he levers the bottle, a popping sound is heard as the cap comes off. 

Mr Rojas then proudly produces the foaming bottle to raucous cheers and starts pouring it out for his hysterical friends.
