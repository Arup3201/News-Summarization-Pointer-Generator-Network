Elizabeth Truss said the UK should take steps to speed up the development of GM crops in the UK

Genetically modified food should be grown in Britain because it is more ‘eco-friendly’, the Environment Secretary claimed yesterday.

Publicly backing the controversial technology for the first time since she was appointed six months ago, Elizabeth Truss said the UK should take steps to speed up its development.

Her claims were furiously rejected by campaigners, who are concerned that so-called Frankenfoods can alter ecosystems and create ultra-invasive superweeds.

Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, Miss Truss also backed plans to weaken EU laws that have so far kept commercial GM crops out of Britain.

‘I think GM crops have a role to play here,’ she said. ‘If you look at what has happened in the US, crops are being grown in a more environmentally friendly way with less water usage and less pesticide usage. I would like us to have that opportunity. Our farmers need access to technology that will help them work in world markets.’

In voicing her support, Miss Truss is following in the footsteps of her predecessor Owen Paterson, who was a staunch backer of GM crops.

However Peter Melchett of the Soil Association described her facts as ‘extremely outdated’, adding that overall pesticide use on GM crops such as maize and soya in the US has actually increased.

Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘Half of US farms have superweeds due to blanket spraying of [herbicide resistant] GM crops with weedkiller.’

And Liz O’Neill, of GM Freeze, added that it was ‘sad but hardly surprising’ to hear the ‘same old rhetoric’ from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

‘We need to learn lessons from the US experience,’ she said. ‘UK farmers don’t want to repeat those mistakes and UK consumers don’t want to eat GM.’

If passed next week, the new EU law will repatriate decisions for GM technology to member states, meaning Britain could decide to grow the crops commercially.
