Tea Party favourite 'Joe the Plumber' has taken a union job and four days into the role claims he was bullied by a colleague who called him a 'tea-bagger'.

Conservative Joe Wurzelbacher, from Ohio, became famous in 2008 during the U.S. presidential campaign when he questioned then-candidate Barack Obama's tax plan in an encounter which went viral.

He was dubbed 'Joe the Plumber' by John McCain's campaign, and Samuel 'Joe' Wurzelbacher was held up as an example of an American worker who would be hurt economically by Obama's election.

Then-candidate Barack Obama speaks to Joe Wurzelbacher as he canvasses a neighbourhood in Holland, Ohio in 2008. The encounter led to him rising to fame as an 'everyman' and conservative campaigner

After his five-minutes of fame he wrote a book and even made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. 

But he's recently raised eyebrows by taking a union job and four days into the role at Chrysler Corporation he claims he was bullied while he was taking a cigarette break by a colleague who used a term meant as an insult to Tea Party members.

New job: Joe Wurzelbacher has recently taken a role at Chrysler Corporation and claims he was bullied on day four

At the firm all workers must be United Automobile Workers union members.

He wrote in a blog post on JoeforAmerica.com: 'I had three days of orientation, and 
now I’m 'on the job' over here at Chrysler and on Day 4, I’m outside on a
 break smoking a cigarette and right on cue – some guy calls me a 
'teabagger.'

'Now, I 
would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Democrats and liberals, who are
 supposed to so tolerant and enlightened regarding homosexuals have for 
three or four years now, have been using a gay slur to describe people 
who they think are associated with the Tea Party.'

'Tea
 Bagger' has traditionally been a derogatory slur used to discriminate 
against usually gay men. It is also a word which refers to a sex act.

Mr Wurzelbacher added:
 'Decorum prevents me from describing it - they got this thing called 
'Google' now for that - but suffice it to say that the double-standard 
for what Democrats can say and what conservatives can say continues 
unabated, but still I thought to myself, did this guy think I’m gay, or 
was he making a statement of my political affiliation?

'I tried talking to him, but he went off about how he was a 'journeyman' and started walking away.'

On the controversial union 
issue, he wrote: 'Most union workers have not been mean, and quite a few
 asked me questions and talked with me and are cool with me.'

He also added that he opposes public unions because 'taxpayers are never properly represented at the bargaining table.'

As
 for private unions, he wrote that 'it's an American worker's right to 
unionize for sure, but that being said, don't expect me not to point out
 when or if union leadership takes advantage of union members.'

Mr Wurzelbacher's reputation suffered after his five minutes of fame when it was revealed the 
tradesman was not, in fact, a licensed plumber. He ran for a U.S. House seat in 2012 but lost in the general election. 

U.S. Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain is joined by Mr Wurzelbacher in 2008. The Ohio man even ran for presidency in 2012

However, he has
 spoken at conservative gatherings and has worked with a veterans' 
organization in Alaska that provides outdoor programmes for wounded 
soldiers.

He has been 
an icon for many anti-establishment conservatives. He drew cheers at a 
tea party rally in 2007 in Cincinnati when he told the crowd not to let 
'a bunch of liberal pansies' take away their rights.

Last
 year he sparked outrage with an online comment piece claiming 'America 
needs a white, Republican president' and assured readers that wanting a 
'white Republican president doesn’t make you a racist, it just makes you
 American.'
