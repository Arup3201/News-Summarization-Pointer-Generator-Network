War hero Ben Parkinson has vowed to take another step on his incredible path to recovery, with the help of a new set of bionic legs.

Lance Bombardier Ben is the most seriously injured soldier to survive the conflict in Afghanistan, where he lost both legs, broke his back and suffered brain damage in a blast from an exploding Taliban mine in 2006.

Against all the odds, the 27-year-old survived, and he is now determined to confound expectations once again by walking unaided on his state-of-the-art Â£60,000 artificial legs.

Hero: Ben Parkinson - the most severely wounded soldier to have survived the Afghan conflict - wearing his computer-assisted prosthetic legs

The computer-assisted legs were created for Mr Parkinson, from Doncaster, by Rehab Prosthetics in Coalville, Loughborough - the same firm that enabled Paralympic gold medallist Johnny Peacock to race to glory in the 2012 Games.

Each of the legs - paid for by the Ministry of Defence - contains a micro processor which senses movement and responds by bending the 'knee', allowing Ben to walk.

Under the guidance of physiotherapist and former Naval officer Robert 'Shep' Shepherd determined Mr Parkinson is making huge progress, and has pledged to walk on his new legs without assistance.

'You don't say "no" to Ben, you don't say "can't",' Mr Shepherd said.

'I struggle to keep up, I no longer make a plan of what to do in the day because he moves so quickly.

'The legs now are just wonderful,' he added.

Mr Parkinson said: 'I don't believe I'll walk again, I know I'll walk again.'

Building confidence: The 27-year-old is having intense physiotherapy to help him grow accustomed to wearing the false legs

Inspiration: Lance Bombardier Ben carried the Olympic Torch in his hometown of Doncaster during the relay leading up to the Games

The soldier spent three months unconscious in a military hospital after sustaining horrific injuries when a mine exploded under his Land Rover in Afghanistan in 2006.

He had to learn to speak again and has been left with co-ordination problems similar to those associated with stroke sufferers.

In June, crowds of people cheered Ben on as he battled for 27 painful and exhausting minutes to carry the Olympic Torch through his hometown of Doncaster in the lead-up to the Games.
