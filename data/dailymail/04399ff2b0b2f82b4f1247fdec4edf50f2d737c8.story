Andy Murray's success in China may be nudging him towards a place in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals but he maintains securing a qualification place for the London showpiece could not be further from his mind.

Murray begins his campaign in the Shanghai Masters against Georgia's Teymuraz Gabashvili on Tuesday having moved up to ninth place in the race to reach the Finals, after following up his tournament win in Shenzhen with a semi-final loss to Novak Djokovic in Beijing last week.

Only the top eight in the standings at the end of the regular season are guaranteed a place at the O2 Arena next month, with Murray currently trailing eighth-placed Milos Raonic by 175 points. Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have already qualified.

9. Andy Murray (GBR) - 3,565

10. David Ferrer (ESP) - 3,535

11. Grigor Dimitrov (BUL) - 3,405 

Murray said: 'My schedule was going to be dictated more how I felt and what I wanted from the end of the year rather than just trying to play to get into the Tour Finals, because I don't think that's necessarily the right way to go about it.

'But the reason I came here (to China) was to try to get some momentum, try to win some more matches, get into the latter stages, play against the best players, and get used to playing at that level consistently again between now and the end of the year.

'But if I play well, I'll give myself a chance at getting to the O2. When I step on the court, that really shouldn't be something I'm thinking about.'

Murray and his rivals will have a number of further chances to ensure qualification, culminating in the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris at the end of this month.

Despite his shock first round loss to Tatsuma Ito in Tokyo last week, Stan Wawrinka remains best-placed to join the big three in London while US Open finalist Kei Nishikori is also in a strong position after winning successive titles in Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo. 

Seventh-placed Tomas Berdych and eighth-placed Raonic are also in Shanghai while, behind Murray, David Ferrer and Grigor Dimitrov also still harbour realistic hopes.
