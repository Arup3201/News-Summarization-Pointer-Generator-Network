Almost two million soldiers lost their lives fighting for Britain in the two world wars.

Over the course of ten years, death struck every city, town and village across the nation... except for 13.

Incredibly, the handful of settlements known as the 'Doubly Thankful Villages' welcomed home every single one of their boys safely - twice.

Memories: A headstone in the graveyard of St Michael's church in the 'Doubly Thankful' village of Catwick, Yorkshire - the only reminder of those who survived both wars

Soldiers: This photograph taken during the First World War, shows Private Herbert Medlend (front row, second left) who was from the village of Herodsfoot, Cornwall

Family: Tony Collett (left) holds the service medals that belonged to his father George Collett, in the 'Doubly Thankful' village of Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire.  Pictured right is the family in the 1940s, including Tony (right), his father George (second right), grandmother Margaret Bell (front), sister Peggy Collett (second left) and a housekeeper. 

The communities span the length and breadth of England and Wales - from Herodsfoot in Cornwall to Catwick in Yorkshire.

But though some were struck by bombs - losing a house, shop or church - they did not lose one human life.

Many still live in the same village.

Former boy soldier Robert Payne, who signed up to serve in the Second World War aged just 15, still lives in the Doubly Thankful village of Langton Herring in Dorset.

A
 century on, Remembrance Day is a discreet affair in the villages such 
as Langton Herring in Dorset and High Toynton in Lincolnshire.

As
 the rest of the country - and the entirety of Scotland and Ireland - 
mourns the millions that paid the ultimate sacrifice, the Doubly 
Thankful residents quietly celebrate their gratefulness.

The name for the villages was first coined by celebrated writer Arthur Mee, who used 'Thankful Village' as a category in his 1933 encyclopedia titled The King's England.

He wrote that a Thankful Village was one which lost no men in the Great War. His list featured 32.

In 1945, the list was revised and it was found that 13 of the 32 had once again celebrated the return of every resident.

Each troop from Scotland and Ireland lost a soldier in the First World War.

The
 villages are: Herodsfoot in Cornwall, Langton Herring in Dorset, Upper 
Slaughter in Gloucestershire, High Toynton in Lincolnshire, South Elmham
 St Michael in Suffolk, Woolley in Somerset, Catwick in Yorkshire, 
Middleton-on-the-Hill in Herefordshire, Nether Kellet in Lancashire, 
Flixborough in Lincolnshire, Herbrandston in Pembrokeshire and 
Stocklinch in Somerset.

Never forget: A roll of honour with names of men who returned safely from World War One hangs in St Michael church in South Elmham, Suffolk, and (right) a dedicated plaque hangs on the wall of All Saints Church in Woolley, Somerset

Two million British soldiers died fighting in First World War and Second World War, but none from 13 villages

Writer Arthur Mee coined the phrase' Doubly Thankful Villages' to categorise them in his encyclopedia of Britain

The villages span the entire nation, from Dorset and Suffolk to Lincolnshire to Yorkshire and Lancashire
