Sir Bradley Wiggins had to settle for second best on his track comeback on Thursday, when his  England team were thrashed by Australia in the men’s team pursuit final.

But on an evening when he effectively confirmed he would never again ride in any of cycling’s grand tours, including the Tour de France, Wiggins insisted defeat was part and parcel of a process that he hopes will end in Olympic glory on the track in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Wiggins, who quickly removed his silver medal after the ceremony, said: ‘I’m disappointed we came second here, but in hindsight we’ll look back and think this is a start point for us now.

‘Rio is the goal and we’ve got to work back from that.’

The Australian quartet, spearheaded by Jack Bobridge, pulverised Wiggins, Steven Burke, Ed Clancy and Andy Tennant, taking gold in a Commonwealth Games record of 3min 54.851sec. England trailed in on 4min 0.136sec.

Wiggins, a four-times Olympic gold medallist, 2012 Tour de France winner and Knight of the realm, said: ‘It takes four people to be on par and firing on all cylinders to succeed (in the pursuit) and (this team) all had different preparation this year. So there’s a lot of positives to take from it.’

He added: ‘I don’t want to sound like (England manager) Roy Hodgson, but we’ve definitely got some work to do.’

Wiggins said there was no doubt in his mind that he still  has the ability to be competitive on the track at world level.

‘I certainly have answered the questions on whether I can still do it or not, but I still think there’s room for improvement and it’s going to take a lot of dedication to the track,’ he said.

‘We were all just on different levels. And the strategy was that if I could go longer and ease the strain off, that’s what team pursuit is about, getting the four riders to the finish. It’s not going to be easy. The  Australians set the standard again.

‘We’ve been in that position before and it’s not a bad position to be in. We’ve done two world-class rides from four weeks together.’

Wiggins has been surprised by the warm welcome the England team have had north of the border. ‘The buzz around the city has been incredible. You get free coffees and everything,’ he said. ‘I think it’s surprised all of us especially being from England.’

This was his first and only event of these Games and he will not compete in another. ‘I rode [in my first Commonwealth Games] 16 years ago, so I won’t be riding in another,’ he said. ‘But the atmosphere of it. I really enjoyed it.’

He revealed further grand tours on the road will be ruled out because ‘heavier, more explosive’ road riding will not be compatible with the track regime he will need for Rio. ‘I don’t think the road will complement it,’ he said.

Same again: English trio (from left to right) Kian Emadi, Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes also won silver in the team sprint

After Wiggins silver, England’s men’s sprint team — Jason Kenny, Philip Hindes and Kian Emadi — were also beaten to the gold, by New Zealand — who ended a  12-year Kiwi gold drought in track cycling in the process. But there was some good news for English cycling as teenager Sophie  Thornhill took the first para-cycling gold medal of the Games by  winning the tandem sprint for blind and visually-impaired athletes.

The 18-year-old from Cheshire, riding with pilot Helen Scott, 24 today, has a form of albinism that gives her only nine per cent vision.

The pair were thrilled to top the podium at the Chris Hoy velodrome by beating Scots Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston in the final.

‘We’ve only been together three months this time, but we were together for four months before and it has just fallen into place,’ Thornhill said.

Para-cycling is in the Commonwealth Games for the first time, and she added: ‘Now we’ve put on a good show perhaps it can feature in future Games.’

On winning in Scotland, she said: ‘I’m not gonna lie, it feels really good, it feels like a home Games.’
