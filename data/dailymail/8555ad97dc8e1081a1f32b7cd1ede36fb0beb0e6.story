A New Hampshire judge has caused fury in a small New Hampshire town after announcing that he plans to reduce the sentence of child molester who was convicted of sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl to just five years. 

Carroll County Judge David Garfunkel initially ordered Joshua Baud, 31, sentenced to 10 to 20 years - with a minimum of seven and a half years behind bars. He announced on September 30 that he had a change of heart and wanted to cut the sentence to just five years.

More than 50 furious residents of tiny Ossippee, New Hampshire, packed Judge Garfunkel's courtroom Tuesday morning to protest his decision, Ossippee police Sergeant Robert King told MailOnline.

Change of heart: Carroll County Judge David Garfunkel has come in for intense criticism after announcing his plan to shorten the prison sentence for a convicted child molester

Baud was a close family friend of the girl's mother and allegedly abused the 7-year-old when her mother left him to babysit

The protesters, along with the victim's mother, from the town of 5,500 people wore t-shirts with the name of a sexual assault and domestic violence charity to show their support for the girl, who is now 15. A group called Bikers Against Child Abuse also came out in force. 

Even the Ossippee Police Department spoke out against the judge's decision, writing on the department's Facebook page: 'This is an astonishing and unheard of move by a Judge, especially without any motion or petition by the defendant or defense counsel.'

'We just felt that, in talking to the chief, that we were so outraged by this professionally and personally that we had to do something,' Sgt King said. 

'We felt in our department that we have the responsibility to make it known this was this process was going on.'

On Tuesday, the number of protesters seemed to sway to judge - at least a little. The hearing was originally scheduled for him to reduce Baud's sentence. Instead, he decided to postpone the decision and hear arguments from prosecutors and Baud's attorney over the sentencing. 

Supporters of the victim, all wearing t-shirts for a sexual abuse support charity, showed up in force to protest the judge's re-sentencing

Carroll County Attorney Robin Gordon argued that the judge did not have the power to shorten the sentence. She also argued that the hearing put even more stress on the victim, who has had to testify against her attacker twice already.

Sgt King said Bauder was a lifelong friend of the victim's mother. He assaulted the girl seven years ago when she left him at home to babysit her children. The girl testified that he fondled her after her mother left. 

The girl kept the abuse a secret for more than five years before coming forward in 2012.

The first case resulted in a mistrial and she had to testify again at a second trial. 

The girl's mother said she's having the relive the horror of her abuse all over again as the judge decides whether to shorten the sentence. 

'This has had a big backlash on my daughter. She was hoping for it to be over,' she said.  

'I think he's wrong. If he could just consider what my daughter's been through. I think this man deserves even more than he got.'
