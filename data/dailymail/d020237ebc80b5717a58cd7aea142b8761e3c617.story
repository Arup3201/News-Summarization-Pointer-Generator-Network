England crashed out of the World Cup on Friday, but manager Roy  Hodgson has remarkably been assured that his job is safe until the 2016 European Championship.

Despite Costa Rica’s 1-0 win over Italy sealing England’s embarrassingly early exit in Brazil, FA chairman Greg Dyke insisted that Hodgson is the right man to lead the country.

When asked if Hodgson — whose earnings of £3.5million a year make him the second highest-paid manager at the World Cup — would remain in his job until the end of his contract in 2016, Dyke said: ‘That is the view of myself, of everybody else here in Brazil and of others in the FA.

Staying: Roy Hodgson will remain in charge of England until 2016

‘We’re supportive of Roy Hodgson, we’ve asked him to stay as manager. Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship. We do not see any value in changing.’

England have lost 2-1 to both Italy and  Uruguay in Brazil, failing to qualify from the group stage for the first time since Sweden in 1958, but Dyke said: ‘Everybody thought we played really well in the first game against Italy and narrowly lost. In the second game it could have gone either way. We were not humiliated. They were narrow defeats, but it is for the football people, not for me, to identify why we did not win.’

Dyke has targeted victory at the 2022 World Cup. When asked if that target was attainable, he said: ‘Yes, but it means lots of changes in English football. There is a real chance that we can develop and win in 2022. That is the aim.’

Hodgson himself admitted he and the team had let the nation down. He said: ‘We’ve failed. We had really big hopes we were going to make the nation proud by going far in the tournament and we haven’t done that. So any words are pretty empty at the moment.

‘I’m very low. So are the players. We had high hopes, we thought we could make an impact. But unfortunately we haven’t won the games.’

It is the first time England — who bow out of the tournament against surprise Group D leaders Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday — have lost their first two games at a World Cup finals.

But Hodgson added: ‘I believe the team going forward will be a very good team. I think there are good young players. Even against Uruguay we saw some good individual performances and the young ones that came on did quite well.

‘But results colour everything. We played a very tough-tackling and strong defensive Uruguayan team. I don’t think there’s any need to have any doubts this group of players will go on to do good things in the time ahead.

‘I think the team are evolving.  I’m proud of the way they’ve approached this tournament and everything they put into it. At the moment I’m just devastated they got nothing out of it.’

Goalkeeper Joe Hart claimed Hodgson has the backing of the England dressing room.

He said: ‘We are proud to play for Roy Hodgson. He’s a great manager, he’s a very passionate man and someone that I’ve got an awful lot of respect for and I hope to continue playing for.’ 

Asked if he thought the team had progressed in two years since Hodgson took control from Fabio Capello, Hart replied: ‘Saying yes sounds like a stupid thing to say, but I do. 

‘We’ve got bags of quality, bags of people coming through, great leaders and great experienced players and we’ve just come up short in two games. I’d imagine some people will say we’re simply not good enough but we don’t feel that inside the camp. 

‘It’s hard to take but we’re at a World Cup and if you don’t get results then this happens. We’ve committed our lives to this tournament and we’ll continue to do that until the end of the group stage, whatever happens.’

Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA director of football development who is retiring after the tournament, believes England can win the World Cup in Russia in 2018 or the European Championship two years later.

‘It will be an exciting time in the next four to six years in English football,’ said Brooking. ‘I think 2018, 2020 is the time when quite a few of our younger players will have lots of good experience.

‘Roy has done really well to include some of those in this tournament. Just the fact he  has had five or six weeks to  work with them will augur  well going forward.

‘There is a really good young nucleus in the squad.’
