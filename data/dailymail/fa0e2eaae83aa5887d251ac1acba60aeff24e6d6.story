Irish tourist Barry Lyttle will be allowed to live with his girlfriend  who has rushed from Ireland to Australia to be by his side after a magistrate agreed to change his bail conditions this morning.

Mr Lyttle, charged with reckless grievous bodily harm after allegedly striking his brother Patrick in Sydney’s Kings Cross nightclub district, appeared at Downing Centre Local Court with his blonde partner Patricia and father and Oliver.

The 33-year-old learned he may face harsher penalties if he is convicted with the assault as the Director of Public Prosecutions will prosecute his case in the District Court.

Family and friends were out in force to support Mr Lyttle for his court appearance on Tuesday

His brother woke up late last month and his father, Oliver Lyttle, today told reporters he is speaking and improving. ‘He’s coming along very well,’ Mr Lyttle said.

A magistrate today amended Mr Lyttle’s bail conditions, allowing him to move from Blacktown, in Sydney’s west, where he has been living with his aunt, to a location closer to St Vincent’s Hospital with his partner.

The decision came after family lawyer Chris Watson told the court: ‘It would be convenient if he could move closer to St Vincent’s Hospital.’

Mr Lyttle and his partner have not yet decided on where they are going to stay and they will have to notify police 24 hours before they move. Police did not oppose the decision.

Barry Lyttle appeared composed in court, accompanied by his father and holding his partner’s hand. He is unable to return to his native Ireland to be with his partner because of his bail conditions.

A court earlier ruled he must not approach a point of departure from Australia and he had to hand his passport over to authorities.

Mr Lyttle arrived in Australia on December 29 with his father. The pair were visiting Patrick, who had been travelling around the country for months previously.

The case continues on February 17.

Since the incident Barry and his father Oliver have been keeping a vigil at Patrick's bedside. Patrick, 31, has since regained consciousness and is now ‘stable’ at St Vincent's Hospital in Darlinghurst.  

Patrick was rushed to hospital on January 3 and spent almost a week in an induced coma in a critical but stable condition.

The 31-year-old woke up on January 9 after his brother, Barry, appeared in court charged over the one-punch attack. 

Patrick had bleeding at the back of his skull and swelling of the brain, a source close to the incident told The Sunday Telegraph.

The Irishman had to have surgery to relieve the pressure on his brain. 

Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Darlinghurst - have told the family it was too early to tell if he would make a full recovery from his serious injuries.

'The only way they will know that he’s not going to recover fully is if his progression stops,' the source told News Corp.

Along with the long anxious wait ahead for family, police will also have to do the same to find out what happened on the night of the alleged attack.

Right now, Patrick  is on strong medication and remains in a state of grogginess.

The source said he was only able to exert his energy for a short period of time and spends most of his time sleeping. 

Barry Lyttle, 33, was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm and was granted bail on January 5

The brothers' father, Oliver, arrived at court to support his older son while Patrick lay in a coma. Oliver and Barry have maintained a near constant presence at Patrick's bedside

Previously, Barry spoke to Daily Mail Australia exclusively, saying: ‘The way things are, we are just taking each day as it comes.

‘He seems to be improving, (we’re all) taking each day as it comes.'

Hours after his brother woke up in hospital on January 9, Barry Lyttle posted a photo to his Facebook page with his brother Patrick, and their father Oliver standing in front of the Sydney Opera House.

Within minutes messages of support were flowing in from friends and family.

'Barry. great picture... great family!!! everything is gonna [sic] workout mate!' wrote one friend.

Another wrote, 'stay strong cuz [sic]! You will all get through this!! Here's to good times ahead, as before!'

The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross - in Sydney's inner-city

Following the January 3 incident, Barry spent a weekend in police custody and was granted bail. 

After Barry's initial court hearing on January 5, a tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters his sons had loved each other since they were children.

'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 

'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 

'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went [in court today] and their sympathy.'  

Patrick Lyttle was treated by paramedics at the scene in Sydney's inner city, where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit

Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life

As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities. He is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol.

He is required to live with his Australian aunt at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day.  

Barry and Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. 

Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument on January 3, causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath.
