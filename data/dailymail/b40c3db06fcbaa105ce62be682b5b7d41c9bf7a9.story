Gareth Bale is being linked with a move away from Champions League winners Real Madrid as the former Tottenham forward continues to face criticism from the club's supporters. 

Manchester United and Chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world's most expensive player back to the Premier League.

Sportsmail asked Manchester United fan Dave Ford of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to Old Trafford.

Given the opportunity, there's not a club in the world who wouldn't want to sign Gareth Bale and Manchester United are no different. The Welshman is the future of football.

United are showing signs of life again. We've picked up our form under Louis van Gaal, sit in the Premier League's top four and beat Liverpool at Anfield prior to the international break. Big money was spent last summer and it will be this year too. It's all systems go in terms of firing us back to the top of English and European football.

However, while the attack is starting to click into gear, something is still missing. Some kind of X-factor. Most of us have confidence that Angel Di Maria will come good, but we still want more. Bale is what we want.

Having two former Real Madrid stars in tandem at Old Trafford is the stuff of dreams. Sure, we'd love to have Cristiano Ronaldo back too, but our former No 7 has just turned 30 and dare we say it - his best days may be behind him. A 25-year-old Bale is the man to pin the hopes on.

It's not all plain sailing for the boy from Cardiff in Spain. He has been criticised in the Madrid press for not pulling his weight, he went missing in last weekend's Clasico and his car even got a boot up the backside from a supporter in the fallout. Real Madrid fans are historically fickle and Bale is their latest scapegoat.

Rest assured that it'll be his head on the chopping block next time Real lose a game. He doesn't deserve to be treated like some children's toy - picked up when loved and thrown down to the ground when not. Bale should seek a club where his talents are appreciated.

Manchester United are prepared to offer an escape route and the subsequent affection he needs. Unfortunately, Bale is still a big part of Florentino Perez's plans and the player himself feels like he still has so much to prove. United are not an option that Bale wants to take just now, but the offer will always remain on the table.

His potential signing is not a case of need. After all, no club is going to spend £86m on a player if he isn't considered some kind of luxury. Bale is a player that can lead us to our former glory. You'd only have to look at the effect he had on Tottenham before leaving for Spain for proof of his influence.

However much he'd cost, Bale would be a worthwhile investment.

His ability to play on either flank or through the middle make him a great option, given he can fit around the likes of Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney in whatever system suits. Heck, he could even play alongside Marouane Fellaini. Any move might unfairly consign the excellent Ashley Young back to bench-warmer, but football has a habit of not being fair.

Nevertheless, don't expect the move to happen this summer. Bale has a lot left to prove in Spain and he's too proud a person to walk away from his dream club just yet. But if there's ever a return to the Premier League on the cards for Gareth Bale, we will be waiting with open arms.
