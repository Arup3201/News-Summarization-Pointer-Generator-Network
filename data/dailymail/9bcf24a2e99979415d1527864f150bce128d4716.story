Some predicted death from ‘sulphurous’ fumes, others that the capital would collapse. Many warned of ruinous costs which would never be recouped (they weren’t wrong on that point).

But thanks to a handful of indefatigable, high-minded Victorians, one of the most ambitious engineering projects in history not only went on to shape London, it has since been copied by almost every major city on the planet.

More than that, the London Underground has become part of the DNA of Britain, a symbol of national creativity and resilience. In war, it protected hundreds of thousands. In peace, it created the suburban dream for millions of families.

A Victorian steam train, typical of those used in the Tube, was driven through Baker St Station to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first London Underground journey in January this year

And, tomorrow morning, an international crowd of VIPs will assemble to recreate the very first Tube journey as the Underground marks its 150th birthday.

Led by Mayor Boris Johnson, they will board an original London Underground train — leather and velvet in first class; benches in third — and travel three and a half miles from Paddington Station to Farringdon Street.

But what makes it an even more historic journey is the workhorse at the front — an original Undergound steam locomotive. There hasn’t  been a steam-powered passenger journey on the Underground since Edward VII reigned.

Of course, anyone who has actually used the Tube — and a record 1.17 billion people did so last year — will immediately ask themselves the same question: how on earth did the Tube cope in the age of steam? It can be fetid enough today in a modern electric carriage.

Funnily enough, it is not that unpleasant. There’s plenty of white wispy smoke, of course, but I’d rather breathe this than the exhaust fumes at a busy road junction.

I have managed to secure a seat for the trial run ahead of tomorrow’s big occasion. Clouds waft in through the open windows of my eight-seat compartment, but there’s just a scent of bonfire. I have shared Tube carriages with more objectionable takeaway meals. What is overwhelming, though, is the atmosphere.

It is getting on for 2am. Transport for London can only test all this renovated rolling stock on an empty network. So the only onlookers are a few diehard steam enthusiasts. None of them has seen anything quite like this, though.

What a gloriously incongruous feeling it is to chuff-chuff through familiar London landmarks, past advertisements for airlines and wi-fi and mobile phones, in a maroon first class carriage built for Victorians, with adverts for soap and day trips to Middlesex.

By day, these stations are heaving. Now, they are closed, half-lit, eerily silent. It’s as if a ghost train from Dickensian Britain has sneaked back to revisit old haunts. We trundle through Baker Street. The very same lightwells which poured daylight and fresh air down on that original Tube line are still in the walls. Pure Sherlock Holmes.

We clatter through Euston Square — or Gower Street as it was called back then — and on through King’s Cross. Shiny signs on shiny walls direct passengers to Eurostar trains heading for the Continent. Yet the Battle of Waterloo was still in living memory when this track was built.

Here and there, maintenance workers stop to give us a standing ovation or film it on their phones. The capital is fast asleep but the driver of Metropolitan Steam Locomotive Number 1, Geoff Phelps, 45, cannot resist the odd blast on his whistle.

‘You’d have to be completely heartless not to be excited by this,’ says Sir Peter Hendy, London’s wide-eyed Transport Commissioner, as we stop at Moorgate to take on water and check the dials. It’s taken years to restore this train.

Some of the volunteer helpers have been invited along for the ride, so excited they can hardly speak.

At around 3am, a whistle orders us all back on board for the return. I sit next to Sam Mullins, director of the London Transport Museum and co-author of ‘Underground’, an absorbing new history of the Tube.

Tonight’s speed is around 20mph but Sam points out that everything was much slower on opening day, 1863: ‘It was chaos and the journey took about two and a half hours.’

The story of the Tube is full of pioneers and crooks, but it had a nobility of purpose from the start. For that, we can thank Charles Pearson, the City of London’s solicitor, who argued passionately that the lot of the ordinary Londoner would be much improved with a subterranean railway (he died before he could see the result).

Another Tube author, Emily Kearns, recounts hostility to the idea in her new book, Mind The Gap. ‘The forthcoming end of the world will be hastened by the construction of the railways burrowing into infernal regions and thereby disturbing the Devil,’ wrote the Rev Dr John Cumming in 1860.

Yet there was only one notable absentee from the euphoric opening on January 9th 1863. The Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, explained that, at 79, he would prefer to remain above ground a little longer.

The new Metropolitan Railway was an instant hit. Opened to the public, it carried nearly 40,000 on its first day. But with so many steam engines operating in a confined space, the cumulative effect was alarming. That same day, a porter was hospitalised due to the ‘vitiated atmosphere’ and several people were left ‘insensible’ from fumes.

Still, a rival soon emerged. The Metropolitan District Railway — known as the District Line — started taking shape from Westminster to Kensington. Eventually, the two railways linked up to create the ‘Inner Circle’ around central London, while both companies furiously maintained their independence.

As they stretched further out to London’s rural fringe, an explosion of housebuilding followed. But another player really shook things up in 1890.

The new City and South London line, running under the Thames to link the southern suburbs with the City, had only one class, to the dismay of papers like the Railway Times: ‘We have scarcely yet been educated to that condition of social equality when lords and ladies will be content to ride alongside Smithfield butchers’. More important, the new line ran on electricity.

The death knell for steam was the dazzling new Central Line, opened  in 1900. It had snazzy new electric carriages, a fixed fare and it opened up London’s great shopping and theatre districts. It also had the Daily Mail to thank for an immortal phrase — ‘the Twopenny Tube’. Thereafter, the entire Underground would be known, for ever, as ‘the Tube’.

Everyone wanted to be a part of the new line. When American retailer Gordon Selfridge opened his Oxford Street store in 1909, he fought — in vain — to get Bond Street station renamed ‘Selfridge’s’.

By 1905, the Metropolitan and District Lines had surrendered to electricity. There would be no more steam-powered passenger trains —until this week (although some steam engines continued to haul goods). Within a year, the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines completed a huge Edwardian electric network.

But it was still something of a disjointed mess until the arrival of one of the most pivotal figures in British transport history. Frank Pick was the master of detail who gave the Tube its own identity, from station design to lettering to posters to its eternal symbol: the red and blue ‘roundel’. He also paid ten guineas to a draughtsman called Harry Beck for a new map.

The result, first printed in 1933, remains a masterpiece. In a 2006 BBC poll, the Beck map was beaten only by Concorde as the greatest British design of all time (and Concorde was half-French).

Yet Beck’s name was removed from the map in 1959 and he died a bitter man in 1974. There is an equally unhappy ending to the Frank Pick story. At the outbreak of war, he was masterminding  London’s evacuation strategy but fell out with his colleagues and with Winston Churchill and left. He died from a brain haemorrhage two years later.

The war was, arguably, the Tube’s finest hour. Yet, at the start of the Blitz, the management tried to stop people sheltering from bombs, fearful that they would never leave and frustrate the Underground’s sacred duty: keeping the capital moving.

By October 1940, the authorities relented. Beds, sanitation and refreshments were introduced. At its peak, there were 177,000 sleeping in the Underground. Tragedies were glossed over: 79 blown apart at Sloane Square, 68 drowned at Balham after a bomb ruptured a water main. Worst of all was a crush at Bethnal Green which killed 173, mostly women and children, in 1943.

With peace came nationalisation, decay and division. It took the 1987 King’s Cross fire to reverse the long-term culture of decline. The advent of the London mayoralty and colossal public/private partnerships would help revivify the network to the point that it is busier than ever, carrying 4 million a day, double the 1982 number.

It remains an endearing paradox. We love to complain about the Tube. And yet, we love it dearly. We’re like an old married couple, bickering yet devoted. ‘You’re not running a rail network,’ says managing director Mike Brown as we chug along. ‘You’re looking after an institution.’

It’s been quite a journey. Happy 150th, you smelly old thing.
