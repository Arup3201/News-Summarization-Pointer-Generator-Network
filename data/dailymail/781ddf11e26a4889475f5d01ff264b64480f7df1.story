I may have looked like a petrified pterodactyl, but inside I felt like a fledgling sea eagle finding her wings.

I was taking a turn at simulated skydiving on the new cruise ship Quantum of the Seas - and it wasn't just the most exhilarating thing by far that I have ever done on a ship, it was the most extraordinary experience of my life.

I've often wished I could fly like a bird - but I wouldn't dream of jumping out of a plane, so I never expected to feel the sensation of soaring and swooping through the air in a vertical wind tunnel with no strings attached.

And the thrills kept on coming.

Inside North Star, a glass pod on a long arm, I was raised upwards and outwards over the side of the ship, 300ft above the waves. Swaying in the wind, the pod rotated to show me people moving like ants around the blue postage stamp of the swimming pool on the deck far below. Next was a spin in the bumper cars, racing around the ship's huge SeaPlex indoor arena until I was giddy. 

None of these exciting activities has been offered on a cruise ship before and I was among the first to have a go on a pre-inaugural mini-cruise aboard Quantum, which has just started her winter season of Caribbean cruises. Good news for British holidaymakers is that identical sister ship Anthem of the Seas, with all the same wow factors, will be based in Southampton from next spring.

Shades of the future: Quantum of the Seas is being marketed as the world's first 'smartship'

Quantum of the Seas makes the most of new technology.

A few taps on a tablet computer and my order for a cocktail was being mixed by one of two robots with bionic arms. They couldn't be trusted with real glasses, though, nor were they able to pop in a paper parasol, so my ungarnished drink slid towards me in a plastic cup.

I saw a mesmerising show in the Two70 lounge, which has floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows by day that turn into a curved screen 100ft wide and 20ft high, creating an eye-popping backdrop for singers and acrobats.

Even the musical in the main theatre was highly sophisticated by cruise-ship standards: a live orchestra in the pit accompanied the cast in a full-length version of West End hit Mamma Mia!

Another 'screentastic' treat is in store for occupants of inside cabins. They get virtual balconies that have a vast screen showing the real-time view from the side of the ship.

Among the score of restaurants is the first at sea for Jamie Oliver.

Jamie's Italian offers the home-away-from-home comfort of the same menu as his chain on dry land. Another celebrity chef, American Devin Alexander, author of The Biggest Loser Cookbook, has created the Devinely Decadent restaurant, serving 'healthy yet indulgent' dishes that are far less calorific than they appear.

Speed, efficiency and the end of queuing for the 4,900 passengers are promised thanks to online check-in, an app for everything, waiters taking orders on tablets, smart wristbands that do away with signing for all those extras, and the ship's own satellite providing internet connection that's as fast as broadband at home.

Royal Caribbean (www.royalcaribbean.co.uk, 0844 493 2061) offers an eight-night cruise to the Bahamas on Quantum of the Seas from £1,499 per person. This includes return flights from Heathrow, one-night hotel stay, transfers and full-board cruise departing on March 13, 2015 from Cape Liberty (New Jersey).

Anthem of the Seas will start no-fly cruises from Southampton in spring 2015.
