A further 2,000 troops, including raw Army recruits, could be drafted in to protect Olympic venues if the security shambles gets worse.

The Armed Forces were told last week to provide an extra 3,500 personnel for the Games after security group G4S failed to provide enough civilian guards.

But military chiefs have begun urgent work on identifying more soldiers who could be deployed in an emergency, and it is understood that a decision on whether to put 2,000 troops on 'notice to move' will be taken tomorrow.

Desperate measures: Soldiers patrol the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. Ministry of Defence officials are making emergency plans to deploy a further 2,000 troops

The security crisis puts an added burden on the military, which already has 48,000 soldiers committed to the Olympics, Afghanistan and other operations across the globe.

The plans emerged after G4S chief executive Nick Buckles admitted to MPs that he did not know how many security guards his company would be able to provide when the Games start next week.

The firm signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, but Mr Buckles told the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday that it had a set a revised target of 7,000.

Preparations: A soldier attends the Ministry of Defence camp in Hainault Forest Country Park, where soldiers drafted in for the security operation will stay

Defence secretary Philip Hammond, has confirmed that 2,500 of the additional military personnel already committed to the Olympics operation are to be housed in an exhibition centre at Wapping in east London.

Tobacco Dock is a grade 1-listed, converted 19th-century warehouse.

The remaining 1,000 troops are to be housed in temporary accommodation in Hainault, Essex and on military bases.

Ministry of Defence planners contacted units this week to find out whether they could spare any more personnel.

The RAF and Royal Navy are understood
to have indicated they have no one available, but the Army and Royal 
Marines will have personnel on standby.

Personnel
earmarked for the roles include up to 150 recruits from the Infantry 
Training Centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire. Instructors could also be
called up.

The recruits will have completed only 26 weeks of training.

The
majority of the emergency force is expected to come from 7 Armoured 
Brigade.

Troops could also come from 20 Armoured Brigade, which only 
recently returned from Afghanistan.

Royal Marines from 3 Commando Brigade have been put on standby.

Sky News quoted an unnamed Home 
Office source as saying: 'The decision to put another 2,000 military 
personnel on notice to move will be taken tomorrow.

30 New bridges built inside the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London

200 Number of buildings that had to be demolished to accommodate the site

587 Acreage of Olympic Park

200,000 Total workforce needed

700,000 Total capacity for all venues

4billion People expected to watch the Opening Ceremony

9.3billion cost in pounds sterling of staging the Games

'This
comes after very intrusive examination of G4S management and while we 
are confident that the recruitment targets will be met, it is prudent to
make contingency plans of this kind.

'If this decision is taken, it will mean that the personnel will be told to be ready to move, but will not be moved.'

A
Home Office spokesman said: 'We have not asked the military to deploy 
any more military personnel beyond the 3,500 already agreed.

'We are constantly reviewing the 
extent of the G4S shortfall and if it becomes necessary to increase the 
size of the military contingent, then this is something we will 
consider.

'There are currently 11,000 military personnel assigned to venue security, alongside G4S staff and accredited volunteers.

'The
Government has committed £553 million for venue security and we remain 
confident that we will deliver a safe and secure Olympics within that 
budget.”

An MoD 
spokesman said: 'As the Defence Secretary made clear at the weekend, 
should there be a requirement for additional military personnel the MOD 
will do whatever possible to make them available.

'At
the present time no further requests have been received but, as people 
would expect, an ongoing programme of prudent planning continues.'
