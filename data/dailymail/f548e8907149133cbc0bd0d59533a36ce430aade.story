Of all the endurance rallies around the world, Dakar is known as the deadliest, most dangerous - and many say, most fun.

It has the largest following of all, and more than 80 per cent of competitors are amateurs who pay handsomely for the privilege of taking part. And they know they might not even make it past the first stage.

Terrains are much tougher than at any other rally. Beastly off-road vehicles struggle to pass even the first stage, battling with salt, mud, dunes, rocks, and sky-high altitudes. 

Every year the pictures that emerge from the spectacular event look more dramatic, more dangerous... and more enticing. But what is it really like on the road with the daredevils and petrol heads who love nothing more than challenging themselves across some of the world's most extreme terrains?

The 9,000km route changes every year and organisers ensure competitors are pushed to their limits. But if it was easy - if it was feasibly doable - it wouldn't be a Dakar.

Serious competitors spend many months leading up to the race preparing for the toughest parts of the course: getting fit spinning at the gym, wearing oxygen masks for high altitude, and trying to figure out the route. 

All the information they're allowed to navigate them through the race is a rolling paper guide connected to the wheels detailing kilometres and direction. Many don't stand a chance, but they can't get enough.

As ex-sponsored female competitor Florence Migraine-Bourgnon, stunning and fearless, who's completed four Dakars, says: 'I don't really like cars. I just f****** love Dakar.'

Who says it's a man's world?

I joined five-time reigning champions Mini for the first few days of the world's most dangerous rally raid. Luckily for me, I started at the first section, taking me from a glamorous launch in Buenos Aires up to rough and tough racing in San Juan, in the west of the country.

On the day of the launch, main roads were closed and people lined up behind the metal barricades to catch a glimpse of the parade

Locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars, various street food stations had popped up everywhere

On the day before the launch, busy and bustling Buenos Aires fell silent as locals stayed at home. Main roads were closed and lined with metal barricades. In a huge city centre, this is something only really seen at sporting events with the grandiose of Tour De France. And the following day,  the city came alive.

Locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars (most of them self-styled) soak up their glory. Entire families piled along every barricade and barrier, eagerly awaiting their arrival; it was clear the Argentine like cars just as much as football.

A parade was due to start, ending in the town square where each of the 414 bike, quad, car and truck competitors were to mount the podium. First are those who paid to take part (about 80 per cent; fees start at £11,000 just to register a bike), then, last year's sponsored and professional competitors, and finally the 2014 winners.

Dakar merchandise and party paraphernalia sellers lined the pavement, various street food stations had popped up everywhere. The atmosphere is like London's Notting Hill Carnival x 10 - and the showgirls are the sort made of ten tonnes of steel with sponsor logos slapped across their shiny bits, hooting for attention.

The race is in its sixth year starting in South America after terror threats in Mauritania drove it out of its African home. The only 'Dakar' left in the race is the Dakar Village, a meeting place for the competitors (located in Buenos Aires).

But while there may no longer be threats of terrorism putting drivers at risk, the race course remains as dangerous as ever, changing vastly each year, with challenging altitudes and extreme terrain putting the baddest cars to the ultimate test.

Watching the event unfold first hand was heart-stopping. On the very first day Nani Roma, 2014 Dakar champion, a firm favourite to win again, broke down after 10km. 

But Mini were still in the lead with several drivers in the top 20 of the car category. The Mini off-road rally car has been developed and redeveloped for years now; and has been customised by genius engineers into somewhat of a transformer. A beast almost impossible to better.

Mini driver Nasser Al-Attiyah led the race throughout and was crowned overall 2015 champion when the rally ended two weeks later, on January 17.

We witnessed the drivers battle it out in the desert close up and in astounding luxury on our tour.

Owned by the French ASO (Amaury Sport Organisation) - Dakar was devised by a Frenchman after all, with the start point being Paris, back in 1978 - the VIP Dakar tours are run by sister company VSO, Dakar's very own travel agent.   

I joined one such three-day VSO tour at the start of the rally taking me from Buenos Aires to San Juan and back again.

It was VIP luxury and up-close action all the way - somewhat of an oxymoron - including a fascinating tour of a bivouac.

The ginormous mobile service station and base camp is where all weary heroes head for food, rest, and to fix up their ride. 

Hundreds of huge trucks full of mechanics and spare parts are stationed nearby daily along each stage of the race. 

Two bivouacs are built at any one time and take three days to erect. We were lucky enough to get to look around and see car doctors mend the machines and even dine with the drivers.

While car nuts do come on VSO tours, their main customers are cash-rich sponsors. Dakar sponsors such as Red Bull and Total make up 45 per cent of customers while competitor sponsors such as Mini make up 38 per cent. Friends and family of those competing, plus 'passionate people', as Florence says, make up 15 per cent. It's a flat fee for everyone.

Of 350 VSO guests each year, there are about 10 who are unrelated to the race, so it's still a small pool for adventurous travellers.

Florence has competed four times - three of those in Africa - and now makes an absolute dream 'tour guide' of sorts with VSO, her second career, with whom she's worked for the past two years. She knows the Dakar from the inside out.

On day three of the tour we went off-road in 4x4s, to sample Dakar like the competitors do.

Eventually, we arrived at what resembled an idyllic mirage: A pop-up gourmet restaurant in the middle of the desert

Champagne on arrival (and throughout our three-hour stay) was followed by a three course meal of empanadas, stew and fruit pudding

Vehicles zoomed past just metres away. We could all witness them so closely and cheer on our competitors; a dream for a keen photographer

We made our way riding for three hours along rocky desert terrain listening to classic rock, before arriving at the checkpoint where all those competing would pass. 

VSO tours start from $290 + tax (£193 + tax) per person per day.

Per two to three-day segment prices start from £1,114 up to about £3,000.

When we arrived we were greeted by what resembled an idyllic mirage. A pop-up gourmet restaurant in the middle of the desert. White tables and chairs beneath a gazebo, kitchen and drinks stations nearby. 

Champagne on arrival (and throughout our three-hour stay) was followed by a three course meal of empanadas, stew and fruit pudding, as bikes zoomed past just 10 metres away. Buggies, cars and trucks followed, and we could all witness them so closely and cheer on our competitors.

Medical staff, race directors and TV journalists closely followed in choppers, while assistance trucks with food, water, medical and mechanical supplies followed behind.

It takes supreme effort to transport an entire pop-up garden party to the middle of the Argentinian desert, in a remote, off-road location. 

It is an unusual adventure trip to take, but with the energy and excitement of Dakar on your doortsep the whole way round, you feel like a racing star from start to epic finish.
