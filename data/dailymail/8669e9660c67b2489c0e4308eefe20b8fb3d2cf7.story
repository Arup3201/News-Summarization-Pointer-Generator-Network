Samantha Stosur labelled fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic ‘pig-headed’ after he accused Andy Murray of political correctness for hiring Amelie Mauresmo as his coach.

Matosevic said he ‘couldn’t do it since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game’, prompting Stosur to hit back after her 6-1, 6-3 win against Christina McHale at the Ageon Classic in Edgbaston.

The world No 17 said: ‘I think that’s just pig-headed. He obviously doesn’t think much of women’s tennis, which is a shame.’

Stosur is coached by Miles Maclagan, who used to work with Murray, but did not rule out a female coach.

She added: ‘I thought, “Good on Andy.” He believes that Amelie has something to add to his game. He had the guts to do it and I hope it goes well.’
