Twinkling city lights, raging wildfires and colorful auroras are lit up in new dazzling nighttime views of the Earth.

They show Britain's major cities bathed in light, with London and it's sprawling suburbs clearly visible.

They incredible images were taken from a newly-launched NASA-NOAA satellite that's equipped with a sensor to observe the planet at night.

The incredible images from Nasa show the UK on the night of March 27, 2012. The image was made possible by the new satellite's 'day-night band' which can spot lighting more accurately than ever before

Nasa's Suomi NPP camera uses aÂ  new technique to capture night images.

Unlike a normal camera that captures a 
picture in one exposure, the day-night band produces an image by 
repeatedly scanning a scene and resolving it as millions of individual 
pixels.

Then, the day-night band reviews the 
amount of light in each pixel.

If it is very bright, a low-gain mode 
prevents the pixel from oversaturating. If the pixel is very dark, the 
signal is amplified.

This allows the instrument to capture images on 
nights with or without moonlight, producing crisp views of Earth's 
atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces.

The satellite, Suomi NPP, was launched on October 28, 2011.

It's latest images show the Nile River bathed in city lights, while a map of the United States shows the heavily populated East Coast illuminated.

Light from fishing boats can also be pinpointed.

'For all the reasons that we need to 
see Earth during the day, we also need to see Earth at night,' Steve 
Miller, a researcher at NOAA's Colorado State University Cooperative 
Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, said in a NASA statement.

'Unlike humans, the Earth never sleeps.'

Miller added: 'It's like having three simultaneous 
low-light cameras operating at once and we pick the best of various 
cameras, depending on where we're looking in the scene.'

'The night is nowhere as dark as we might think,' Miller said.

And with the VIIRS day-night band helping scientists to tease out information from human and natural sources of nighttime light, "we don't have to be in the dark anymore, either.'

'The remarkable day-night band images from Suomi NPP have impressed the scientific community and exceeded our pre-launch expectations," said James Gleason, Suomi NPP project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

'The instrument can capture images on
nights with or without moonlight, producing crisp views of Earth's 
atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces.

The satellite also captured the glow from natural sources including moonlight, northern lights and naturally-occurring fires.

After Superstorm Sandy made landfall in late October, hard-hit New Jersey, lower Manhattan and the Rockaways appeared dark in the satellite images compared with surrounding areas - the result of widespread power outages that plagued the region for days and weeks following the storm.

Mitch Goldberg, program scientist for NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System, said: 'NOAA's National Weather Service is continuing to explore the use of the day-night band. The very high resolution from VIIRS data will take forecasting weather events at night to a much higher level.'
