A care assistant who drunkenly drove the wrong way along a motorway for four miles has been spared jail.

Katy Homer, 27, admitted drink driving and dangerous driving and was told she had committed a 'very serious driving offence' which passed the custody threshold.

But when sentencing her judge Michael Dudley handed her a four-month jail term, 
suspended for 12 months.

Katy Homer, 27, leaves Wolverhampton Crown Court after receiving a four-month jail term, suspended for 12 months and a driving ban of three years

A lorry driver is forced to swerve out of her way after drunk Katy Homer joined the southbound carriageway and started heading north

Footage of the incident shows oncoming drivers flashing their headlights and moving out of the way.

She was given 180 hours of unpaid work and a year’s 
supervision by probation services for the dangerous driving offence.

For driving with excess alcohol she was 
given a month in prison, also suspended for 12 months, to run 
concurrently, banned from driving for three years, and ordered to pay 
£200 costs.

Footage of the 
incident played in Wolverhampton Crown Court showed oncoming lorry 
drivers flashing their headlights as Homer drove her Vauxhall Astra 
north on a southbound section of the M5 in the West Midlands.

Alka
 Brigue, prosecuting, said one lorry driver later told police of the 
moment he saw the headlights of Homer’s car approaching him at speed and
 head-on along the slip road.

She said: 'It left him feeling scared.

'It
 was his daughter’s birthday - he envisaged that somebody would be 
killed, and that he might never see his wife and daughter again.'

Ms Brigue said that, at the last moment, Homer 'swerved' across to the hard shoulder, avoiding a collision.

Traffic
 police stopped Homer after she eventually exited the M5 in West 
Bromwich in the early hours of December 4 last year, having joined the 
motorway at the previous junction in nearby Oldbury.

Officers
 were dealing with a crash when they spotted Homer, of Halesowen, West 
Midlands, leaving the motorway, busy with HGV traffic, using an entry 
slip road.

Ms
 Brigue said the police first tried to wave her down as she twice went 
the wrong way around the roundabout junction, and eventually halted her 
by stepping out into the road and flashing their torches.

Ms Homer was sentenced after she pleaded guilty to charges of drink driving and dangerous driving

Homer,
 her eyes red, was breathalysed and later blew a reading of 79 
micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, which is more than 
twice the legal limit of 35mcg.

Malcolm Fowler, in mitigation, said his client was of previous good character and was 'deeply, bitterly ashamed' of her actions.

He said friends, family and her GP all attested to the behaviour being 'wholly out-of-character' for the single mother-of-three.

However,
 he added Homer had been dealing with a depressive illness which may 
have been affected by a 'disastrous relationship' with a former partner.

He
 said: 'Everything indicates that against very considerable personal 
adversity the defendant has kept in very reasonable work and been an 
extraordinarily good mother to her three children.'

Mr
 Fowler said it was 'these pressures, with the under-tow of depression' 
that went some way towards explaining why she got in her car drunk and 
drove the wrong way along the motorway.

He
 added the impact on Homer, whose driving licence was previously clean, 
had hit 'very hard' and he claimed had led to one of her children being 
bullied at school.

Homer’s 
father, who was in court supporting his daughter, was 'a professional 
driver', Mr Fowler added, and the crimes had no doubt therefore brought 
particular 'dishonour and shame'.

Speaking after sentence outside court, a remorseful Homer said she was 'sorry' for her actions.

Her
 father, who gave his name as Robert, added: 'She’s sorry for what she 
has done and she just wants to put this behind her now and focus on the 
children'.

Commenting on the
 case, Inspector Dave Southam, of West Midlands Police, said: 'There is 
no doubt how serious this incident could have been.

'CCTV footage from the time shows other vehicles having to move out of the way.

'Thankfully,
 due to the time of day, the motorway was not as busy as it otherwise 
might have been and so no significant harm was caused to others.

'Ultimately
 driving whilst under the influence poses a risk to both the driver and 
others on the road - regardless of whether it is on a motorway or a 
quiet side street, and this case will hopefully serve as a warning to 
others who make the dangerous mistake of getting behind the wheel after 
they’ve had a drink.'
