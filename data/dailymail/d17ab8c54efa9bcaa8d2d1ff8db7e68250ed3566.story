Home prices have fallen for a third straight month in nearly all major U.S. cities, with the latest drop steeper than expected and highlighting the hurdles still facing the economic recovery.

Prices dropped in November from October in 19 of the 20 cities tracked by a home price index out on Tuesday, with the steepest declines in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan.

Prices in Atlanta; Las Vegas, Nevada; Seattle, Washington; and Tampa, Florida, fell to their lowest points since the housing crisis began. Phoenix, Arizona, was the only city to show an increase.

‘We are braced for a more bumpy picture over the next few months,’ analyst Sean Incremona said. ‘A lot of expectations probably ran away or got a little too lofty coming into the end of the year.

‘We are still in a very modest recovery, and we do see consumption slowing this quarter, and data like this supports that picture,’ added Mr Incremona, an economist at 4Cast Ltd in New York.

The S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of single-family home prices declined 0.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was a bigger drop than the 0.5 per cent economists expected.

‘The trend is down and there are few, if any, signs in the numbers that a turning point is close at hand,’ said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Standard & Poor's index committee.

The decrease added on to the 0.7 per cent fall in October from September. A separate Conference Board report said its consumer attitudes index fell to 61.1 in January from 64.8 the month before.

Americans are clearly turning gloomy 
about the job market and their income prospects. The data frustrated 
expectations for an increase after sharp gains in November and December.

The economy grew at its fastest pace in one and a half years in the final months of 2011, but early 2012 could see weaker growth, thanks to a tired housing market and lacklustre consumer spending.

Separate data showed business activity in the U.S. Midwest slower than expected in January. Wall Street erased gains following the data, leaving stocks trading flat at mid-morning.

On a seasonally-adjusted basis, 17 out of 20 cities racked up monthly home price declines, and average national prices were around levels seen in mid-2003, according to S&P/Case-Shiller.

Prices in the 20 cities also steepened their year-over-year decline, falling 3.7 per cent compared to a 3.4 per cent decline in October. Previous data lead to optimism that the housing sector is healing.

Some economists believe prices will find a bottom this year, but the recovery is expected to be a lengthy one as the market is hampered by an excess amount of homes for sale and weak demand.

‘The most likely scenario in the U.S. is that in 2012 prices will bob around a bit, with one month's gain being reversed the next month,’ Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said.

The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer slid to 60.2 from 62.2 last month, shy of expectations for 63. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy.

As politicians aim to rein in the deficit, the U.S. is believed to be on track for a fourth straight year with a $1 trillion-plus budget deficit as a sluggish economy holds down corporate tax revenue.

However conditions are improving for those in a position to buy a home. Job growth is up, prices are down, mortgage rates are at record lows and rental prices have risen sharply since the housing bust.

Still, many are left scratching their heads as they can't afford to buy or even qualify for mortgages. Some people in position to buy are holding off, worried that prices could fall even further.

‘In the fourth quarter there were a few indicators suggesting the economy was shifting into higher gear but in January we've gotten a lot of data to suggest the opposite,’ analyst Christopher Low said.

Many economists say the U.S. could be 
experiencing what happened in Britain in the 1990s, when it took four 
years for home prices to rise again after falling prices left homeowners
with little equity.
