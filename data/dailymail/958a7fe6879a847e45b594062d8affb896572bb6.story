Real estate tycoon Donald Trump brought an aggressive if vague platform to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, but raised eyebrows with his continued questions about President Barack Obama's birth certificate.

He hammered Hillary and Bill Clinton, saying the former president would soon face new troubles related to his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Clinton is a 'nice guy,' Trump said, but 'he's got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island' where Epstein entertained his wealthy and famous friends – allegedly with sex parties featuring underage girls.

The former U.S. president took a trip there in 2002.

Donald Trump insisted Hillary Clinton was the first birther but said he still has questions about where President Barack Obama was born

THE DOCUMENT: The White House released President Barack Obama's long-form Hawaii birth certificate on April 27, 2011 as 'birther' conspiracy theories swirled

Trump's return to birtherville came at the tail end of his star turn at CPAC, the annual cavalcade of conservative catnip that serves as a vetting ground for potential presidential contenders.

He said he still wonders 'whether or not it was the real birth certificate' that the White House released in 2011.

'I certainly question it. ... We have to find out whether or not it was real,' he told a near-capacity crowd in a Maryland resort ballroom.

After his speech, Trump told Daily Mail Online that 'the positive response today at CPAC was enormous.'

He noted that Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity brought up the birth certificate during a Q&A session. 

The U.S. Constitution says only a 'natural born citizen' can become president, making questions about a candidate's birthplace red meat for opponents.

Trump has floated a variety of theories explaining why he thinks the president has hidden the circumstances of his birth, At one 2014 press conference he suggested that Obama might have lied about his birthplace in order to get preferential treatment in university admissions.

When he flirted with a run in the 2012 presidential contest he offered a $5 million charity bounty for the release of the birth certificate, the president's college records, and his passport applications.

The birth certificate – but nothing else – followed.

'I'd still like to see his college records,' he said at CPAC on Friday. 'I think it's important.' 

FIRST BIRTHER? The idea that Barack Obama wasn't born in the US, and is therefore ineligible to be president, originated with Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential primary campaign – which was later defeated by Obama's

He also reminded the crowd that Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign was the first to suggest Obama was born outside the U.S., saying that it would make him ineligible to run.

That came as the two were locked in a Democratic primary slugfest. Eight years later Mrs. Clinton is the Democrats' heir apparent, attracting shots from all Republican quarters – including Trump's.

'As far as his birth certificate, Hillary wanted his birth certificate,' he jabbed at CPAC. 'Hillary is a birther.'

He told Daily Mail Online that both 'Hillary Clinton and John McCain were birthers – but failed birthers.'

'I was able to get him to release the document or whatever it was that he released,' he said. 

'He didn't do it for them; he did it for me.'
