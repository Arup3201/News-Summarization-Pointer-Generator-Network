Rooney and Co. were given the chance to meet fans of the Premier League giants before making their way to training ahead of their first pre-season friendly.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal's first game in charge of the club will come against LA Galaxy during the early hours of Thursday morning (BST) - before the Red Devils take on Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid in the States.

Van Gaal may have some fresh faces in his squad before Manchester United return to England at the beginning of August as chief executive Ed Woodward has decided to return to Old Trafford.

Woodward is said to have flown back to England 'for general business' - which could be related to Manchester United's interest in Borussia Dortmund centre-back Mats Hummels who has been linked with a £16million move to Van Gaal's side.
