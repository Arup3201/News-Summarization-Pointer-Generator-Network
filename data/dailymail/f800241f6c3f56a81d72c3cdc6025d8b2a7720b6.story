An atheist campaign to ban the historic practice of saying prayers at council meetings yesterday found its way to the High Court.

Former councillor Clive Bone, backed by an anti-religious campaign group, claims the tradition breaches his human right to freedom of belief.

Mr Bone said he was ‘disadvantaged and embarrassed’ when Christian prayers were said in the council chamber.

Non-believer: Councillor Clive Bone outside Bideford town council offices. He has complained about the prayers

Backed by the National Secular Society, 
Mr Bone wants prayers to be ruled out of the formal agenda of any local 
authority meetings.

His case reached the High Court yesterday at the culmination of a three-year campaign.

Success could open the way for a drive to force Parliament to abandon saying prayers as part of Commons and Lords business.

The NSS has based its legal challenge on the claim that Mr Bone, as an 
atheist, should not be subjected to religious ritual, and that to do so 
breaks his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

However it was revealed yesterday that he is no longer a councillor in Bideford in Devon. Town clerk Heather Blackburn confirmed: ‘Mr Bone did not stand for re-election in May 2011.’

The Society said yesterday: ‘The NSS is taking Bideford Town Council to court after receiving a complaint from one of its councillors, Clive Bone, that he was disadvantaged and embarrassed as a non-believer by the saying of prayers as part of council business.

‘He has either to sit through them or
leave the room without leave of the Mayor. The Council even rejected a 
suggested compromise period of silence.’

Backing for prayers: Communities minister Eric Pickles

Its lawyer David Wolfe, told Mr 
Justice Ouseley in the High Court: ‘The claimants challenge the town 
council’s practice of holding religious prayers.

‘We say the conduct of holding prayers within the formal part of the meeting is an unlawful practice.’

Bideford council has voted to keep 
its prayers. Similar decisions have been taken by other town councils in
Devon when the argument has been raised over the past three years.

The council’s legal defence is being aided by another pressure group, the Christian Institute.

Mike Judge, of the Institute, said: ‘The Council have debated this several times. They’ve debated it, they’ve sought advice, they’ve held special meetings and they’ve voted on it.

‘And the majority of them said, actually we would like to continue with this practice. It cannot be unlawful for the Council to say prayers if it has democratically chosen to do so.’

Ministers yesterday indicated support for the council.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he could not comment on the issues before the High Court, but added: ‘This Government recognises and respects the role that faith communities play in our society.

‘Prayers are an important part of the religious and cultural fabric of the British nation. While the decision on whether to hold prayers is a matter for local councils, we believe they should have the freedom to do so.’

Mr Bone, a management consultant, is in his 60s and describes himself as ‘semi-retired’. He is a regular contributor of letters to newspapers on subjects ranging from engineering to the forthcoming remake of the Dambusters film.
