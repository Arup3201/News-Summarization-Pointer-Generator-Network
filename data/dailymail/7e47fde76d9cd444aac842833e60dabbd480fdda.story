She simpered, smiled, flicked her hair; he beamed, they leaned in closer... never mind the clothes and supermodels parading past them, Harry Styles and Sienna Miller only had eyes for each other at the Burberry Prorsum show yesterday.

The 19-year-old One Direction star flirted outrageously with actress Sienna, 31, as the pair sat next to each other on the front row at what has become the hottest show at London Fashion Week.

Styles was wearing a leopard print T-blouse by the label: It would have been churlish not to, given the free clobber he receives from the brand (a fact we revealed in these pages yesterday, and which meant I was barred from seeing the show live).

Sweet nothings: The pair were seen whispering into each other's ears as they chatted away animatedly

Sitting next to Styles and Sienna, 
looking like the proverbial third wheel, was singer Paloma Faith, with 
wild orange hair.

Also on the front row was US Vogue editor Anna 
Wintour, in a powder-blue cowl neck coat and a wild expression (she 
doesn’t do rain), actress Naomie Harris and models Arizona Muse and Suki
Waterhouse, wearing respectively a beanie hat and a shearling coat; 
remember, these girls have no fat to keep them warm.

Samantha
Cameron made an entrance in a bright orange skirt under a black woolly,
fresh from her first LFW presentation for Smythson on Sunday, an event 
at which I was told in no uncertain terms I was not welcome.

That's my girl! Harry Styles only had eyes for Cara Delevingne as she rocked the runway at the Burberry Prorsum spring/summer 2014 show in London's Kensington Gardens on Monday afternoon

Not now, Sienna: Despite the best efforts of Sienna Miller to avert his eyes from the catwalk with her flirty chat, the 19-year-old pop heartthrob looked utterly spellbound

Her role as
champion of this country’s second biggest employer of women, the 
fashion industry, still doesn’t want you, dear reader, to see exactly 
what she’s been up to.

The 
front row was glamorous, certainly, but a smidgen less star-studded than
in recent years.

Last year the premier pew saw actress Alice Eve, gold 
medallist Victoria Pendleton, burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, legendary
snapper Mario Testino and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sitting 
side-by-side.

Supermodel strut: Harry looked impressed as he saw his rumoured love interest strut her stuff in front of the great and good of the fashion world

There she goes: The One Direction singer only had eyes for Cara, and immediately rushed backstage to be by her side as soon as the show drew to a close

Front row crew! Harry sat alongside Paloma Faith, Sienna Miller, Suki Waterhouse, George Barnett and Naomie Harris

Ladies' man: Paloma, Sienna and Suki were clambering over each other to talk to the pop hunk

And what of the clothes? I was amazed at the 
understatement: No trenches seemingly made from Quality Street wrappers,
no super-chunky biker jackets made from python and fur.

It was all 
rather soft and floaty and easy: Diaphanous pencil skirts embellished 
with petals beneath a slouchy jumper.

Voluminous summer coats with 
bracelet sleeves in blush pink and pistachio, and lilac worn over bare 
skin. There was lots and lots of sheer, so you could see the mint 
knickers beneath each outfit.

Dapper dude: Harry looked slick in a black wool coat, skinny jeans and a printed jumper as he attended the London Fashion Week showcase

Mr popular: Harry enjoyed a seemingly incessant stream of female attention from his fellow celebrity attendees

Up close and personal: Sienna, 31, seemed to be paying particularly eager to chat with the teen idol as they waited for the show to start

Tickled pink: Harry appeared to be entertaining Sienna with his no-doubt hilarious anecdotes

Funnyman: Worlds away from her usual cool, calm and collected exterior, the actress couldn't help but erupt into a fit of giggles as she chuckled away on the front row

Keeping up with the cool crew: Paloma, Sienna, Harry and Suki made for a very stylish group as they sat on the front row

Effortlessly chic: Sienna rocked a teal midi-skirt and a fur coat as she posed for photographs before the Burberry show

(So that’s why designers use so much 
sheer: To stop that all-important, hugely expensive front row from 
dozing off).

There was much less of the bling that has seen the brand 
garner success in the Far East and Russia, but which has simultaneously 
made it less cool and covetable here.

Cara
Delevingne, unable to refrain from smirking in Styles’s direction, 
emerged near the end of a very long show seemingly enveloped in cling 
film, perhaps to keep her fresh given she has walked for almost every 
designer so far.

Oh, how the fashion crowd applauded at the end, free 
bags at their feet.

Expect 
to see the new iconic print – a splodge – on Victoria Beckham, Harry et 
al in the coming days.

You could click and buy items from the show the 
moment it ended, even as Miss Wintour was being rushed through the exit 
by black-suited bouncers (I always wonder what she thinks a bunch of 
fashion editors are going to do to her).

Until September 30, each piece 
can be handmade to order, and even comes with a personalised gold 
nameplate.

What’s the 
betting that those celebrities who prostituted themselves in the cold 
London drizzle in front of paparazzi banked outside the Burberry marquee
will have personalised sets winging their way over to them already? 

Ever the joker! Cara looked hilarious in a black balaclava as she and Jourdan Dunn left the catwalk show in the back of a car

Quirky: The model of the moment joked around with photographers as she continued the rounds of London Fashion Week
