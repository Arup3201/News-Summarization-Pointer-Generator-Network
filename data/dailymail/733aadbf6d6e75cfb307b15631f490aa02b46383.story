Betty Williams, 86, has reserved every table at a local pub so that lonely people can enjoy a festive dinner together this Christmas

A widowed former school teacher has hired out a pub to lay on a Christmas lunch for 50 strangers - likely to cost £1,000 - just so they won't feel lonely over the festive season.

Betty Williams, 86, who lives in West Hill in East Devon, has reserved every table at the Lamb and Flag pub in Ottery St Mary and will foot the bill for the traditional turkey dinners and bottles of wine.

The pensioner, who was originally going to keep her identity a secret, lost her husband 12 years ago and has found herself along over the Christmas period in recent years due to a lack of close family and an inability to travel.

And this year, determined not to eat by herself again, she made the reservation and extended an open invite to people who would otherwise be on their own.

The former Italian and French secondary school teacher said: 'I've been watching programmes on television about food banks and people by themselves being in trouble.

'Every time my post comes there is a request for money, and I thought rather than send the money abroad, why not help local people? 

'I just thought it was the sort of gesture I could make to people in the local community who might be in trouble. That was my only intention. It has completely snowballed.'

Mrs Williams, who doesn't have any children, has since received donations of more than £1,000 from as far as America and Holland after her news of her plight went international.

The Oxford University graduate added: 'I don't have any close relatives at all. I was an only child, my husband was an only child, and we live miles away from other relatives.

'My nearest relatives at the moment are in Derbyshire or Kent - a long way away.'

She first approached the town's mayor, Glyn Dobson, to see if he thought the idea was reasonable and after little persuasion he stepped in to help organise the event. 

He said: 'It's a very kind gesture. I think it is because she has been on her own.

'It is people who wouldn't be having a Christmas lunch or spending it alone. Most of them are local people and they are mostly elderly.'

He added that the lunch on Tuesday, December 23, for those who live in the parish will start at 12.30pm.

The Lamb and Flag pub in Ottery St Mary will host the Christmas lunch, set to cost around £1,000 on Tuesday

Along with a full dinner with all the trimmings, the generous pensioner has also ordered two bottles of wine for each of the 12 tables.

At the full price, such a spread will cost £21.95 per person for food and £14.95 per bottle of wine - a total of £1,097.50 if 50 people turn up. However, the pub is offering an undisclosed discount.

Cllr Dobson added:  'The pub are very happy. They thought it was lovely. In the town, it's all been very positive.

'She [Mrs Williams] hopes to come but she said don't count on it. If she does come, I will say the generous lady is here and we will give her a round of applause.'

And the generous benefactor will not be spending Christmas Day alone in her £490,000 house in the small village either.

'I have been invited out by some friends to go to their house [on Christmas Day] and by other friends on Boxing Day,' she said.

'I thought I was going to be on my own with a tin of soup.'
