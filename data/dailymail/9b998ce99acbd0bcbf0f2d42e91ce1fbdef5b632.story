More than 100 puppies who were kept in such squalid conditions they were going deaf have been saved - after dog lovers raised more than $200,000.  

The spaniels were set to be auctioned off to puppy millers who planned to breed them for profit.

But volunteers from Alabama launched a rescue bid and after donations from across the globe in just 11 days, 108 dogs have escaped the clutches of breeders.

The pups, who were covered in fleas and their own waste, were crammed into cages and due to be auctioned off in in Wheaton, Missouri.

Conditions were so poor that many were blind and deaf. 

But a group of Cavalier Spaniel owners, who call themselves 'the Cav Ladies'  launched 'Operation Cavalier' to raise funds and buy out the puppy sellers - and raised more than $220,000 from 2,050 donors.

Organiser Angie Hubbard Ingram said: 'Our group had to do something to help these dogs. At this point, we had all become emotionally invested with the welfare of these dogs and had to find a way to save them.'

Mrs Ingram and her daughter Kara as well as fellow dog lover Crys Carnes from Inverness, Alabama, formed groups to bid against the breeders on November 22.

PR guru Amanda Ruisi, Lisa Thompson, Brittney Wilk, Lacelliese King, Crys Carnes, Kara Ingram and Angie Ingram also helped raise awareness and funds.

But a group of dog lovers from Wheaton, Missouri, called 'the Cav Ladies', pictured, rescued them after raising $220,000 from donations 

After they were saved by the kind volunteers, the dogs were transported to a vet to be treated

But with just three hours left, Mrs Ingram ran out of money, sparking an international plea for more cash to save the pups.

Mrs Ingram said: 'We made a pact before ever going to the auction that we would spend every dime and do everything within our power to leave no pup behind. 

'When we ran out of money after purchasing 30 or so dogs, I was devastated.

'We were in communication with all the volunteers and they put out a plea for money. Within thirty minutes, I was back in, bidding again and I had a minimum of $75,000 that had been dropped in to my PayPal account.'

The donations saved 96 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, seven Shiba Inu as well as two Cocker Spaniels, a Shih Tzu, a French Bulldog and one Yorkshire Terrier.

The dogs were then treated by vets from nearby Caldwell Mill Animal Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama.

And the volunteers have now launched a huge operation to find permanent homes for the dogs and hundreds of dog fanatics have offered to bring them home for Christmas.

Mrs Carnes said: 'When it was all over, the emotion was so overwhelming. 

'Angie and I were so relieved that we didn't know what to do.'
