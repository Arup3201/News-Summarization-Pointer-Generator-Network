Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic has signed for Atletico Madrid from Bayern Munich.

The 28-year-old striker lost his place at Bayern with the arrival of Robert Lewandowski, and Atletico have moved quickly to offer Mandzukic a new start.

'The incorporation of Mario Mandzukic is great news because he has the features we were looking for to cover this position,' Atletico sports director Jose Luis Perez Caminero said on the club website.

'He's a winner, a player used to winning titles. He'll contribute very much.'

Mandzukic scored 33 league goals for Bayern in the two seasons that followed his transfer to the Bavarian giants from Wolfsburg in 2012.

Although his goals helped the club win an unprecedented European and domestic treble in 2013 and a double last season, the Croatian has been deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern.

Bayern vice chairman Jan-Christian Dreesen said: 'We thank Mario Mandzukic for two great years here in Munich. In this time we won seven titles and his goals were often decisive for them. We wish him all the best.'

Poland striker Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last term, is set to lead the attack next season after joining from Borussia Dortmund.

Mandzukic is Atletico's most expensive signing since Radamel Falcao moved to the club from Porto in 2011 and his task will be filling the void left by Diego Costa - Atletico's top scorer last season - who is joining Chelsea.

Atletico are expected to make another move for a striker in the summer to replace New York City FC-bound David Villa, and are believed to be interested in taking Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku on loan.

However, their signing of Mandzukic means that they are expected to end their pursuit of Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who is valued at over £25m.
