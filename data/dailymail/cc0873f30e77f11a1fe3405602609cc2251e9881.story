Most little girls would be absolutely thrilled at the prospect of having a baby sister.

But  this feisty two-year-old  was none too pleased to learn that her newborn sibling was on the way home - and she certainly wasn't shy to show it.

The adorable girl, named Piper, was filmed by her father launching into an incredible temper tantrum and steadfastly refusing to have anything to do with her sister.

The father is heard asking 'Hey Piper do you like your baby sister?', to which he gets the curt response 'No!'

As Piper slams her dummy up against a door and stamps her feet in defiance her father  asks 'Do you want to give your baby sister a hug?' Again he gets a firm 'no!'

The father then changes tactic asking  Piper to come over and give him a hug. But this goes down even worse and the little girl slumps to the ground kicking her legs in fury.

The video has since gone viral picking up over 400,000 views on YouTube in just three days.
