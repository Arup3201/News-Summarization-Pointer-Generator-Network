For most people, Christmas is a time for loosening their belts and indulging in calorific treats.

But for those wanting to watch their figure over the festive season, one chef has created a guilt free Christmas lunch, which contains fewer calories than a bag of nuts.

Gurpareet Bains has come up with the three-course meal called the 'Guilt-Free Gala' by replacing traditional ingredients with superfoods, meaning it only contains 930 calories, around one third of a classic lunch.

It includes turkey with roast potatoes and all the trimmings, a lobster and vegetable starter, and a rich fruit pudding with mascarpone cheese for dessert.

And not only is the meal gluten free, it also contains 11 portions of fruit and vegetables, more than double the government's recommended five-a-day and is said to taste 'exquisite'.

A normal Christmas dinner, with fat-soaked spuds, sugar-coated parsnips, Christmas pudding and canapes, would weigh-in with an average of 3,200 calories, 2.5g of salt, and anything up to 90g of fat - more than a woman's entire recommended daily allowance of 70g. 

The banquet includes a starter of butternut squash and pear soup with lobster (150 calories), a main of turkey breast poached in mulled wine spices with blueberry sauce and all the trimmings (470 calories) and a dessert of superfruit Pudding with green tea and chia seeds (310 calories). 

To keep the calorie content lower nutritionist Mr Bains replaced traditional, oily ingredients with healthy superfoods to reduce its calorific content by 71 per cent.

The entire meal contains just 19 grams of fat - the equivalent of three mince pies or a single serving of cheese and biscuits.

By comparison, a 200g bag of Tesco salted mixed nuts contains 1,300 calories and 116g of fat.  

Mr Bains, an award-winning Anglo-Indian chef and bestselling cookery author, first hit the headlines in 2009 after creating a cancer-fighting curry.

His fans now include a host of celebrities including DJ Chris Evans and designer Vivienne Westwood, and the Royal Family.

Mr Bains, who has been perfecting the Guilt-Free Gala since 2012, says that he understands that people want to indulge over the festive period but he says this can be done without ruining your waistline. 

'Christmas is a time for indulgence and for enjoying the finer things in life. But that enjoyment doesn't have to come at the expense of your waistline or cholesterol levels.

'It's incredibly easy to go overboard at Christmas, but this meal means that we can still eat indulgently and try new flavours without worrying about the waistline.

'I set out to create a traditional Christmas dinner with a twist, and one that is not just better for you than classic lunches but that is actually good for you.

'The Guilt-Free Gala is the culmination of two year's efforts and, I'm very pleased to say, my testers say it is exquisite.

According to research, Britons will unwittingly consume a shocking 7,000 calories on Christmas Day alone, with some exceeding the daily recommended allowance before sitting down for dinner. 

The endless supply of chocolate, snacks, mince pies and festive drinks also means the average British person will gain 6lbs in the eight days between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.

Butternut Squash and Pear Soup with Lobster

Ingredients:

Method:

Place the butternut squash, diced pears, chopped onion and stock cube in a large saucepan. Cover with 1 litre boiling water, and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until the butternut squash is soft, stirring occasionally. 

Blitz the soup until smooth. Place the cumin seeds in a non-stick frying pan and heat on a medium heat until the seeds start to sizzle and pop - this should take no longer than 2 minutes. Mix the cumin seeds through the soup and reheat to serve. Garnish with the lobster meat and dill. Season to taste with black pepper.
