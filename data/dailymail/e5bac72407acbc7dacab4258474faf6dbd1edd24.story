The
 feud between Theresa May and Michael Gove reflects an increasingly 
bitter battle behind the scenes over who should succeed David Cameron as
 Conservative leader.

A
 recent poll showed Home Secretary Mrs May has overtaken Boris Johnson 
as favourite among the party faithful. But  Mr Gove, who denies he 
wants the job himself, claiming he is ‘too ugly’, backs an increasingly 
confident George Osborne.

Buoyed
 by the economic revival, and with a new slimline image after going on a
 diet, the Chancellor is now seen as a serious contender to take over. 
Tory critics of Mr Gove claim that he is behind moves to  crush anyone 
who poses a threat to Mr Osborne.

leadership battle - with Mrs May as the favourite to succeed David 
Cameron

Government
 sources said the Home Secretary and the Education Secretary would each 
be interviewed by Sir Jeremy and asked to account for their conduct and 
that of their advisers.

The
 Mail on Sunday revealed in March how Mr Johnson was enraged after 
learning Mr Gove told a private dinner party that the London Mayor had 
‘no gravitas’ and was ‘unfit to lead the nation’.

The Education Secretary  has had a series of similar confrontations with Mrs May.

He went for the jugular last year after she made a speech on his pet project, free schools, without asking his permission.

Mr
 Gove saw it as part of an attempt to promote her No10 ambitions and 
during a  Cabinet session a few days  later, he spoke of his ‘shock at 
seeing some around the table participating in leadership speculation’.

Mrs
 May sat in silence, glaring at him. Her friends say she regards Mr Gove
 as ‘a wild-eyed neo-con’ and ‘out of step with mainstream 
Conservatism’.

Mr 
Gove’s friends claim she is ‘dull and uninspiring’ and ‘lacks the 
intellectual firepower and quick wits’ to be Prime Minister.
