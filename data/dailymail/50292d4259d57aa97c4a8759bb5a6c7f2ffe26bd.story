The Norwegian boy who told police he was a dwarf who had forgotten his licence when he was caught taking his parent’s car for a joyride last week, has done it again.

This time, the boy, aged ten, liberated his aunt of her car and drove from Fagernes to Tonsåsen, a trip of about 20-25miles, before he was stopped, his parents said today.

As soon as the parents realised their son was gone – along with his aunt’s Opel – they called police.

Good excuse: A boy drove off a snowy road in Norway, after he stole his parents car. When police found him he told them he was a dwarf who forgot his driver's licence

After finally being stopped on national highway 33, it emerged that the boy had been driving at least 11miles on motorway E16.

‘It
 was my sister's car that he took. The keys were in the ignition, so 
unfortunately, it was easy for him to to get hold of them,' his mother 
told Verdens Gang.

After the
 last time, the young boy had promised his parents that it would never 
happen again, but his mother said she assumes the temptation was too 
great.

'He is a boy who likes adventure and excitement, that's all there is to it,' she added.

The boy caused a stir last week when he put his 18-month old sister in the family car while his parents were still sleeping.

Returned safely: The town of Dokka, north of Oslo, where the 10-year-old boy is from

The boy set out from his hometown 
Dokka, located some 65miles north of Oslo to take his sister to visit 
their grandparents in Valdres, 37miles away.

He
 managed to drive nearly 7miles (11kilometres) before veering off the 
road, where he was found by a snowplow driver who alerted police.

‘The
 parents woke up and discovered that the children were missing and that 
someone had taken off with their car. They were pretty upset, as you can
 imagine,’ said Baard Christiansen, a spokesman for the Vest Oppland 
police district said at the time.

‘The boy told the snowplow driver that he was a dwarf and that he had forgotten his driver's licence at home.’

Police said the children were not injured and the car was not damaged, and that no charges would be filed.

‘We
 have talked to them, and I'm pretty sure they're going to pay very 
close attention both to their children and to their car keys in the 
future,’ Christiansen said.
