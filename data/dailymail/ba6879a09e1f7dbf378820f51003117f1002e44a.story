A North Dakota neighborhood is under siege by jackrabbits the size of small dogs.

Residents of the community in South Fargo awake each day to  herds of up to 50 of the dead-eyed critters swarming area lawns and playgrounds like something out of a Hitchcock film. 

While the jackrabbits, which can weigh as much as 9 pounds, gobble up gardens, lawns and even some trees, residents are at a loss about how to control them.

They're heeeeere: A North Dakota neighborhood has been besieged by wild jackrabbits, a ravenous and fast multiplying hare species

Creepy: Like something out of a Hitchcock film, the 9-pound jackrabbits congregate by the dozens in area yards and playgrounds

'Every day, I feel like the crazy rabbit lady chasing them out of the yard where they're having a hay day,' area resident Kayla Straabe told. 

'There's at least 40 to 50 everyday, and they're in our yards and by a children's park.' 

Straabe posted a photo to Facebook in early December, around the time the jackrabbits first appeared, that showed countless paw prints in the snow outside her home alongside the sad remnants of some flower bushes.

'Can anyone tell that there have been a million rabbits eating all of our perennials this past week?' she wrote.

Kayla Straabe says she now sees some 50 of the jackrabbits at a time. When she contacted animal control, they said there was nothing they could do

Since they showed up, the rabbits have grown in numbers. And with their ability to have four litters per year of as many as nine offspring, their numbers will undoubtedly grow if nothing is done. 

Straabe said she contacted local animal control department, who said there was nothing they could do. 

The hares, they said, are wild animals and not under their jurisdiction.

However, the officials apparently weren't above doling out tips on how to control the hares.

'I was told we should poison them, which I will absolutely not do,' Straabe told ABC. 

In addition to the concern over laying poison near a playground, the jackrabbits are close to a dog park.
