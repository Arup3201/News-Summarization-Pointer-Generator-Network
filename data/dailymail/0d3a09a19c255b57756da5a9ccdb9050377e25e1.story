Zimbabwe's cash-strapped national airline has suspended all of its flights to Britain after one of its planes was impounded at Gatwick over unpaid bills.

Air Zimbabwe bosses today announced that the state-owned company will no longer serve London or Johannesburg, South Africa, amid a crippling financial crisis that has engulfed the company.

The move comes after one of the struggling airline's 767s was last month seized at Gatwick airport over an outstanding Â£780,000 ($1.2million) debt with a U.S. parts supplier.

The impounded aircraft was held at the London airport for more than two weeks before it was finally released after the debt was paid on Christmas Day.

The seizure followed the impounding of a second Air Zimbabwe plane earlier in December in Johannesburg over a separate unpaid bill.

Airline bosses have since confirmed the company has temporarily ceased flights to both destinations amid fears its aircraft could be targeted again by its creditors.

Local media reported that Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe personally ordered the move after he was apparently forced to charter a jet for his Christmas holiday when his usual plane became stranded in Britain.

The Radio VoP news website reported: 'The Minister of Transport and Communications, Nicholas Goche, has issued a circular to stop Air Zimbabwe management from flying its aircraft to South Africa and the United Kingdom where one of its long haul Boeing 767 aircraft was recently impounded over an outstanding debt.'

Sources at Air Zimbabwe told Radio VoP that the minister took the drastic action last week after he got a tongue-lashing from Mugabe

The president nearly missed his annual holiday to the Far East after the long-haul plane that he normally uses to travel on outside trips was impounded in London.

The grounding of flights between Zimbabwe and London, and Zimbabwe and Johannesburg, is expected to last until at least January 15.

The nationalised airline, which used to one of the most successful in Africa, operates a fleet of seven planes and is based in the country's capital Harare.

However, years of financial mismanagement and political interference has left the company swamped beneath a mountain of debt.

The government has said it would work to resolve the crisis and the airline is due to contact its debtors this month to discuss its finances.

Air Zimbabwe is continuing to operate routes from Harare to other African destinations including neighbouring Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

However, Radio VoP reported that the temporary closure of routes to Britain and South Africa could prove financially catastrophic as the destinations provide a significant proportion of the airline's income.

The current crisis follows a turbulent year for Air Zimbabwe, which was grounded for several weeks during 2011 after its staff went on strike.

Local media has previously reported that the national flag carrier suffered last-minute changes to its schedules after its aircraft were commandeered by Mugabe.

The 87-year-old leader has no presidential private jet and instead reportedly demands to charter one of the airline's planes at his whim when he decides to travel.

By doing so, the company has been forced to repeatedly cancel or postpone flights, destroying passenger confidence it its timetable.

Mugabe's Christmas holiday is at least the ninth time the tyrant has travelled to Asia in the last year.

It is believed several of his previous visits were to receive treatment at a private hospital amid reports he is suffering from cancer.
