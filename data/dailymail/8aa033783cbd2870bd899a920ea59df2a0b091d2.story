Criticism: Business Secretary Vince Cable took aim at the Bank of England for curbing lending to businesses

Furious Vince Cable has accused the Bank of England of behaving like the ‘Taliban’ in imposing strict lending rules which have held back the economy.

The Business Secretary said tough restrictions imposed on banks to build up stock piles of money was choking off lending to small firms.

In a further escalation of the row between the government and the Bank of England, a Treasury source slammed the ‘jihadist’ tendency in Threadneedle Street towards the banks.

Mr Cable’s outspoken intervention comes ahead of figures tomorrow which are expected to show a sharp return to economic growth by up to 0.6 per cent for the last quarter.

But the minister suggested the recovery could have come sooner if the Bank of England had encouraged more lending to businesses to help them expand and hire more staff.

Mr Cable said: ‘One of the anxieties in the business community is that the so called “capital Taliban” in the Bank of England are imposing restrictions which at this delicate stage of recovery actually make it more difficult for companies to operate and expand.

‘It is clear that the main banks are failing to support good British companies in key areas like exporting and innovation,’ he told the Financial Times.

Mr Cable has expressed similar views before, but the strong language of his latest intervention comes less than a month into the tenure of new Bank governor Mark Carney.

It remains to be seen whether his remarks will persuade policymakers to soften their stance or simply harden their resolve.

Chancellor George Osborne was reported to share Mr Cable's views. One Treasury official told the FT that it was hoped that Mr Carney would rein in the ‘jihadist’ tendency of the Bank of England in imposing tough rules on lenders.

The Bank's new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has ordered Britain's five biggest lenders to raise £13.4 billion to plug a £27.1 billion gap in their finances.

Tensions: The public attack will heap pressure on new Bank of England governor Mark Carney to shift policy

Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society, was reportedly left with a £1 billion hole.

Two weeks ago it announced that it had been able to meet the PRA's demand for it to strengthen its leverage ratio - a key measure of financial strength - to 3 per cent from 2 per cent, without raising extra funds from investors.

The fear is that in order to meet the new targets, banks and building societies will cut back on lending to households and small businesses.

Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think Vince Cable is quoting other people, rather than trying to use the word himself.

‘But there clearly is concern in various parts of the industry about the pace at which they're required to raise their capital ratios.

‘The trouble at the moment - and indeed for the last five years - is that we've had this massive increase in capital amongst banks of £165 billion during a time of low economic growth.

‘Across the banking sector as a whole, there clearly is a correlation in the short term between requiring banks to massively upgrade the amount of capital they have and the amount of lending and the amount of economic growth.’
