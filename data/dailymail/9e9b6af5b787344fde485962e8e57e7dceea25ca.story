A second Army officer has resigned his commission to publish a harrowing, warts-and-all account of the human cost to the British Army of the war in Afghanistan.

Earlier this week Oxford-educated Territorial Army captain Dr Mike Martin, who was commissioned by the MoD to write a book about the war, quit when Whitehall later attempted to block its publication.

Now former reserve Captain Christian Hill has resigned so he can publish what promises to be a highly-embarrassing account of his time serving with the Army's Media Operations Group.

Former reserve Captain Christian Hill has become the second Army officer to resign in order to publish a warts and all account of the Afghanistan war

Mr Hill's role in Afghanistan was to promote positive coverage of the war in the UK media, creating the impression that the campaign was having a positive effect and that the Army was in control.

But according to his book Combat Camera, due to be published next week, that was often far from the case.

Mr Hill, who now works as a journalist for the BBC in Nottingham, said he would regularly witness soldiers being brought back to camp with limbs blown off by IED explosions.

He told the Independent: That was never something we were going to shout from the rooftops to the press but I grew uncomfortable with the fact people back home were not really being made aware of this.

He added: 'Lie is too strong a word for it. Our key message was that we were in the process of helping Afghanistan.

'I wasn't exactly Goebbels but I was conscious of seeing a number of guys getting badly injured - you never heard so much about that in the press.'

In total, 448 British lives have been lost in Afghanistan, including (from top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley and Private Anthony Frampton, with (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford. An inquest heard that the six soldiers were killed when a bomb destroyed their vehicle in Helmand

After being handed a copy of Combat 
Camera in December last year, the MoD told Mr Hill that his book would 
be subject to a 35 day clearance review which would be handed to top 
brass who could block publication.

When
 he failed to get a response to a request for clarification on any 
possible national security breaches he decided to step down.

Mr Hill said he was not surprised that Dr Martin resigned in light of the fact he waited for almost a year without feedback from the MoD.

Dr Martin's criticism of intelligence blunders and the failure of commanders to
 understand the conflict is said to have embarrassed officials.

The MoD has asked for his book to be pulped, allegedly claiming it 
breaches the Official Secrets Act and uses classified material uncovered
 by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, which Dr Martin and his publisher 
deny.

The MoD denied claims it had tried to block the book using the Official Secrets Act.

A
 statement on the MoD's website said the Army accepted classified 
documents referred to in the book were from public sources so the final 
decision not to approve publication was not based on the act.

It said: 'The MoD is not in any way attempting to prevent the book's publication.

'The
 Army simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to 
publish a book that is so heavily critical of the Army, the MoD and our 
allies.

'The existing 
policy on publication of books and articles by serving military 
personnel is clear and exists to ensure that our operational security 
and the personal security of our people is protected. It is also 
designed to protect the hard won reputation of the Armed Forces.'
