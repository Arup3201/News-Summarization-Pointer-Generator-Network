Four of the Royal Family's armed bodyguards are being investigated over claims that weapons seized from visitors to Buckingham Palace have gone missing.

Three sergeants and one police constable from the SO14 Royalty Protection squad - the highly-trained police squad which shadows royals around the globe - are being probed over allegations of 'mishandling property'.

One of the sergeants has been placed on restricted duty while officials from Scotland Yard's internal standards team investigate the claims.

Four police officers from the highly-trained SO14 squad, which protects the Royal Family, are being investigated over allegations of 'mishandling property' from the weapons disposal bin at Buckingham Palace, where 'weapons' seized from visitors to the Palace are stored

One palace source said the claims - which centre around the 'weapons disposal bin' used during security checks at the Palace - had sent 'shockwaves' through the Palace.

They told the Sunday Mirror: 'These officers are highly trained and highly trusted to protect Her Majesty and other senior royals.

'Any suggestion that they have been involved in wrong doing at the Palace will be very embarrassing for Scotland Yard.

'It beggars belief that apparently quite dangerous items have gone missing.'

The probe involves allegedly missing items from the 'weapons disposal bin', where visitors to any royal residence, including VIPs and other royals, are made to go through security checks.

Visitors must leave any property which could be considered as a weapon, including knives and scissors, in the bin.

The SO14 unit looks after royals both in the UK and abroad, 24 hours per day. Three sergeants and one police constable are under investigation

Some of the more bizarre items which must be left behind include long umbrellas, alcohol and aerosols.

The bin in relation to this investigation is reportedly located at Buckingham Palace, although a Met spokesman said he could not confirm this.

SO14 is the unit of armed police officers which is responsible for personal protection for the Royal Family, both domestically and internationally.

Around 50 officers from the 400-strong unit look after 20 members of the Royal Family, 24 hours a day, funded by the taxpayer.

Officers, who are plain-clothed and licensed to carry firearms, usually carry a Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun and a Glock 17 nine-millimetre semi-automatic handgun.

The unit is also responsible for looking after London's palaces, Windsor Castle and Balmoral, the Queen's Scottish estate.

A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Officers from the Directorate or Professional Standards are investigating an allegation of mishandling of property from the weapons disposal bin by SO14 officers.

Four officers, three sergeants and one PC, are the subject of the Directorate of Professional Standards investigations. One sergeant has been placed on restricted duties.'

The spokesman added that none of the officers had been suspended and that no arrests had been made.

The Met spends more than Â£300,000 every day protecting high-profile people from royals to senior politicians and visiting dignitaries.
