Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment a £300,000 Lamborghini crashed in London - with the supercar taking off on impact as it clips a car that pulled out in front of it.

The deafening sound of the Lamborghini Aventador's V12 engine is heard as a Mazda 2 pulls out onto the road.

At this point, the 217mph supercar comes into frame and hits the Mazda, the force lifting off the ground.

In a split second the young driver loses control of his exotic motor and hits a stationary BMW 3 Series before coming to a halt.

A passerby then rushes over to the passenger's side (right-hand side) and opens the door to help a young lady out of the car.

The driver then gets out to see parts of his 700bhp Lamborghini strewn over Sloane Street in Chelsea.

The
 accident, which happened on Sunday afternoon, was filmed by stunned 
onlooker Thomas Melsens and obtained by the supercar website Shmee150.

was the absolute last thing I ever imagined I would end up witnessing.’

'From YouTube videos he enjoys to drive it fast and rev the engine to create exhaust flames.

‘It's a very nice example of the Aventador so I wonder whether we'll see it on the road again.

‘The owner seemed young and was with a group of friends after the crash who all seemed relaxed bearing in mind the wreckage on the road.

‘I have never seen a Lamborghini in such a bad way, and couldn't really believe my eyes or ears when I heard about this crash.’
