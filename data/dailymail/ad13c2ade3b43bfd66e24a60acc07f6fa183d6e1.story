The cause of death for Philip Seymour Hoffman was an acute mixed drug intoxication of heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine, it was announced today.

The Oscar-winning actor, 46, was found dead on February 2 in his $10,000-a-month West Village apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes.

Hoffman's tragic death came less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab for his addiction after being clean for 23 years.

According to the New York medical examiner on Friday, acute mixed drug intoxication was the cause of death.

One of the drugs found in Hoffman's system was benzodiazepine - a psychoactive drug with sedative and muscle relaxant properties that can be used to treat anxiety disorders. 

The other prescription drug found in Hoffman's system amphetamine was an 'upper' - such as  Adderall - and can be used to give an enhanced feeling of wakefulness and focus.

Mixing the heroin and cocaine together is known as 'speed-balling' and is the same deadly combination that claimed the lives of actors River Phoenix, John Belushi and Chris Farley. 

The star 
reportedly fell off the wagon during the wrap party for his 2012 movie 
The Master and entered rehab in May of last year.

The Capote star was found at dead at his home early on the Sunday morning by friend David Bar Katz when he didn't show to pick up his children.

Police had been investigating his death as a suspected drug overdose.

Investigators
 have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a total of 
$1,200 inside a supermarket near his home on the Saturday night before his death.

The New York medical examiner announced on Friday that Philip Seymour Hoffman's death was caused by an acute mixed drug overdose of heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine.

Speedball (also referred to as power-balling)  refers to shooting heroin or morphine in the same syringe. Some also use it with two syringes, one in each arm.

The term can also be applied to use of pharmaceutical opioids - benzodiazepines or barbiturates along with amphetamines.

The cocktail of drugs can cause a strong physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, and is extremely deadly.

Three
 people were later arrested during the investigation into the source of 
the drugs, including a long-time friend and 'drug dealer' Robert 
Vineberg.

Struggling jazz musician Vineberg, 57, was arrested on February 4 in his apartment in the pricey Nolita district of Manhattan and charged with drug possession after hundreds of bags of heroin were found at his home.

Before his death, Hoffman separated from costume designer 
Marianne 'Mimi' Oâ€™Donnell, the mother of his three children, as he battled addiction. 

Hoffman moved into an apartment close to where Ms O'Donnell lives with the children in their $4.2 million apartment.

The actor leaves Ms O'Donnell and their three children - son Cooper, 10, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa.

The actor, who won an Oscar for Capote and also starred in The Hunger Games, The Master and Moneyball, was considered one of the leading talents of his generation.

He was remembered at a funeral on February 6 for 400 people at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The service at attended by his 
family and close friends in Hollywood including Cate Blanchett, Meryl 
Streep, Ethan Hawke, Amy Adams and Joaquin Phoenix.
