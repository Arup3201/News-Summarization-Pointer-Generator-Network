When Kellie Wells crossed the finish line of the 100m Hurdle Olympic event yesterday, she won more than the bronze.

Miss Wells finally accomplished what she set out to do when she was just a teenager who turned to the track to find herself and overcome the tragedies that befell her.

As a high school sophomore, she left home after her mother's fiancée raped her - a difficult decision for anyone - but it was compounded by a horrific accident a month later in which both Jeanette Wells and Richard Gomes were killed.

She has used her position in the world 
of sports to promote empowerment for survivors of abuse, saying 
confidently 'I always tell people you don't have to be a victim.'

'I haven't slept. And I can't. I'm still floating!' she tweeted. ' I did it. I got medal. Omgg!'
