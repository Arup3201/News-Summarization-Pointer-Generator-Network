Former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Al Gore, PGA golfer Tiger Woods and rapper Kanye West are among the newest high-profile victims today of a group that claims to have hacked 23 politicians, public figures and celebrities.

First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Beyoncé and Kim Kardashian are also on the list.

Phone numbers, addresses, credit scores, and even car payments and cable bills are all part of a document dump posted online by an unknown group of hackers.

The bombshell security breach first revealed on Monday has left Los Angeles police, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals struggling with how to respond - after the leaders of all three agencies were also targeted.

Sensitive information: Personal and financial information was posted for all of the celebrities on the list, including golfer Tiger Woods

Hacked: The Social Security number and credit reports that allegedly belong to First Lady Michelle Obama have been posted online by hackers

Power couple targeted: Beyonce and Jay-Z are among the celebs whose financial information has been posted on the website

Twenty three celebrities and public officials have been targeted in the hacking attack, since the website was revealed on Monday.

The updated list follow:

Also on Wednesday, the Twitter account associated with the hackers was suspended. 

FBI Director Robert Mueller, U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia Hylton and LAPD boss Charlie Beck weren't alone. Michelle Obama, VP Joe Biden and former 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had their addresses and other sensitive information posted online.

Beyoncé, Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian were also exposed by the site - although it is unclear  how the information was
obtained or why these individuals were selected.

Social Security numbers allegedly belonging to Mel Gibson, Jay-Z and 15 others matched records in public databases.

Ashton
Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Donald Trump and Attorney-General Eric Holder 
also had their personal details made public in the mass dump of 'secret 
files', known as being 'doxxed'.

There has so far been little comment 
from representatives of the public figures targeted in the cyber attacks
as to the accuracy of the information revealed.

A Secret Service spokesman told MailOnline that the agency is looking into the matter but will not comment further due to the ongoing investigation.

The site, which bore an internet 
suffix originating in the Soviet Union, remained active on Tuesday and 
bears a quote from the TV show Dexter as the tagline: 'If you believe 
that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his 
sleeve.'

It appears as if the site is continuing to reveal the details of yet more famous people today.

The names of Sarah Palin, Hulk Hogan and Arnold Schwarzenegger were added to the list on Tuesday.

Michelle Obama's on the other hand is
largely positive featuring an 'I Love Michelle' sign and the message: 
'Blame your husband, we still love you, Michelle. <3'

The existence of the hacker's website was first reported on Monday by TMZ. The site reported that both the LAPD and the FBI are investigating the hack.

Los
Angeles police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said the LAPD was investigating the 
posting of chief Charlie Beck's information and would also investigate 
the posting of information on any celebrities who live in the city and 
request an inquiry.

Bold hack: Information posted on Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not include credit reports but included addresses and other sensitive information

Store cards, car loans and cable bills are among the sensitive information that has appeared on the web. 

Several of the purported credit 
reports appear to have been generated last week. Many of the pages 
featured unflattering pictures of the celebrities or government 
officials whose information was posted.

Forbes reported that some of the credit unions involved were investigating.

He said confidential information on top police officials has been posted online at least twice before.

'People get mad at us, go on the Internet and try to find information about us, and post it all on one site,' Smith said.

'The best word I can use to describe it is creepy,' he said about the practice. 'It's a creepy thing to do.'

Socialites: The social security numbers and credit reports of Kim 
Kardashian and Paris Hilton were also exposed by the elaborate hack

The
site's page on LAPD chief Charlie Beck includes a taunting reference to
former police officer Christopher Dorner, who was killed in a shootout 
after killing four people over several days last month.

Beck reopened Dorner's case and ordered a
review of the LAPD disciplinary system after the black ex-cop's online 
manifesto accused the department of racism and bias in his firing and 
vowed to get even with officers and their families

Dorner
killed four people, including two police officers, in his rampage 
before he committed suicide during a fiery shootout in a California 
mountain cabin two weeks ago.

Beck's
page on the hackers' site included the message 
'#YouCantCornerTheDorner' and an image of a woman protesting police 
corruption.

Out in the open: Information belonging to Two and a Half Men star Ashton Kutcher and singer Britney Spears were also revealed by the website

The hacker group Anonymous had threatened a cyber-attack in retaliation to Dorner's death last month.

While government officials often have to disclose details on their finances - and celebrity divorces sometimes feature public financial data - the information posted online exceeds those disclosures.

Social Security numbers are rarely included in public records anymore because they can be used for identity theft.

In December, a man who hacked email accounts belonging to A-listers including Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera was sent to prison for a decade.

Christopher Chaney, 36, pleaded guilty to nine felony counts earlier this year - including identity theft, wiretapping, and unauthorized access - after he leaked nude and revealing photos of the women online.

Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested in 2011 as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'.

The depth of his hacking - which kept the unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - enabled him to witness exchanges between celebrities, their family members and their doctors.

In all he was accused of illegally accessing the private information of around 50 stars with virtually no technical computer training. The 36-year-old also admitted to being privy to information about male stars who were hiding the fact they were gay for the sake of their careers.

Prosecutors said Chaney illegally accessed the email accounts between November 2010 and October 2011.

Nude photos Johansson had taken of herself were later posted on the Internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, her ex-husband who is now married to Blake Lively.
