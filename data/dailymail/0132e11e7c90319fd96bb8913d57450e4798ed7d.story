The Danish royal family are enjoying a break from official duties with a family ski holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, this week. 

Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Crown Princess Mary headed to resort with their four children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven, and four-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. 

The royals looked to be having a great time as the posed up for photographers at the resort this morning.

Australian-born Mary, who met Frederik at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and relocated to Denmark three years later, raced her husband down the slopes in a plastic toboggan. 

The 43-year-old looked radiant in a royal blue quilted jacket, black salopettes and a stylish pair of designer sunglasses. 

Frederick was dressed in a simple navy blue jacket and khaki salopettes but unlike the rest of his family, he steered clear of snow boots and wore a functional pair of hiking shoes.

The children were dressed in a range of primary colours and the twins continued with their tradition of matching jumpsuits, with Vincent in blue and Josephine in red.

Princess Isabella squealed with delight as she took charge of a racer toboggan 

Its is their second trip to Verbier in as many years - the royals all decamped to the resort last year in exactly the same week for some fresh mountain air and a week's skiing. 

The family will have enjoyed a quiet few days on their own after a busy Christmas that saw them celebrate with the Greek royal family.  

Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, her two children and their families joined Princess Benedikte and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and their families at Fredensborg Palace on the Danish island of Zealand.  

Mary and Frederik co-ordinated their ski looks with chic shades of blue 

Christian took a tumble on the slopes after taking a corner at high speed 

Mary was on hand to bring Josephine back to the top of the children's slopes 

Mary's son Vincent was dressed in a similar shade of blue to his glamourous mother
