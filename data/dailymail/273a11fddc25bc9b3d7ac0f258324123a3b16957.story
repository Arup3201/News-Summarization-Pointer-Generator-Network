It's the winter spread that was meant to be a feast for the senses.

Instead, Australian Gourmet Traveller's August edition picked an interesting choice of garnish for their potato, onion and bacon tart - a fly.

The photo for the tart recipe was shot outdoors in Tasmania where editors unfortunately missed the mini insect nestled amongst the crispy bacon.

But the error was picked up by sharp-eyed reporters at mUmBRELLA.

The magazine's 'Greater Taters' feature includes several jazzed-up potato classics such as the 'rebooted shepherd's pie' and 'baked spuds uptown with crabmeat stuffing'.

Unfortunately for the savoury tart, which was selected for a double-page spread, it was ironically listed as a recipe with 'top-notch topping'.

It was a take on Mike Eggert's recipe, from Sydney's fancy Pinbone restaurant.

Daily Mail Australia contacted the magazine, owned by Bauer Media Group, for comment but did not receive a response.
