Nepal has announced a cut in the price of climbing Mount Everest, despite concerns that attracting more mountaineers will add the to huge deposits of rubbish blighting its natural beauty.

The current fee for climbing the mountain is £15,000 per person - though discounts are available for groups. This regime will be replaced with a flat fee of £6,600 for every climber.

Madhusudan Burlakoti, the head of Nepal's Department of Mountains, said the previous system was dangerous because it encouraged climbers to team up even if they had never climbed before and had different levels of experience.

He said: 'We hope to attract more climbers and also at the same time better manage the climbing teams. This will allow the smaller teams and individuals more freedom when they climb Everest.'

But the increase in footfall on the mountain this may bring could result in even more refuse accumulating on the slopes of Everest.

The vast quantities of food wrappers, climbing gear and oxygen cylinders - leading some to dub Everest the 'world's highest garbage dump' - is so bad it has led to calls to close down the mountain while a clean-up takes place.

Italian climbing legend Reinhold Messner, among others, has said the mountain needs time to recover, but the government, which collects £2million a year in climbing fees, has refused.

Tens of thousands of Nepalese hoteliers, trekking guides and porters also depend on climbers and the money they bring.

Nepal, which has eight of the 14 highest mountains in the world, is also reducing fees for its other peaks, which were much less expensive to begin with.

Ang Tshering, who chaired a government committee which reviewed mountain tourism, said new plans are in place to make sure climbers bring their rubbish down with them.

He said: 'Our focus has been on minimizing the negative impact on the environment in the Everest region.'
