The oldest person to climb Mount Everest today announced that he will not make any further attempts to scale the world's highest peak - even though his new record may soon be in jeopardy.

Yuichiro Miura, who reached the 29,035ft (8,850m) peak at the age of 80 on Thursday, said: 'I think three times is enough.

'At this point I could not think of anything but rest.'

Miura said he will try again despite his rival Min Bahadur Sherchan planning to beat his record

Miura was meant to leave the mountain yesterday but only left today because of poor weather

However, Miura's record may be short-lived as his 81-year-old rival, Nepalese climber Min Bahadur Sherchan, is preparing to climb Everest and is at base camp.

Sherchan held the record for five years until Miura's climb last week.

Miura was only able to leave the mountain today - a day later than planned - because of poor weather conditions.

The Japanese former extreme skier, who today flew to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, said of his rival: 'I hope his success is good news. I wish him best of luck.'

Miura, however, insisted that Sherchan 
back up any claim of scaling Everest's peak with clear photographs of 
the climber showing his face at the summit.

Miura had climbed Everest in May 2008 at age 75, but Sherchan did the same a day earlier at 76.

The Japanese climber  conquered the mountain again on Thursday, alongside his son Gota, 43.

His feat is even more remarkable as he underwent heart surgery in January for an irregular heartbeat,
 his fourth heart operation since 2007.

He also broke his pelvis and left thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident.

Miura became famous when he was a young man as a daredevil speed skier.

He skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to break his descent, which was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, 'The Man Who Skied Down Everest.'

He has also skied down Mount Fuji.

It was not until Miura was 70, however, that he first climbed to the top of Everest. When he reached the summit again at the age of 75, he claimed to be the only man to accomplish the feat twice in his 70s.

After that, he said he was determined to climb again at age 80.
