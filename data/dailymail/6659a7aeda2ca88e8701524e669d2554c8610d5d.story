He is without doubt the most fashionable bunny in Britain – and his antics are followed by thousands on social media.

But supermodel Cara Delevingne’s pet rabbit Cecil almost came to an unfortunate end last week after he was let loose in the offices of Mulberry, home of the designer handbag.

Miss Delevingne released Cecil, giving him free rein of the room, while she sat at a table with executives before a photo shoot.

A source said: ‘He was happily eating the celery out of the Bloody Marys and just hanging with everyone.

‘He was hopping around into everyone’s lap and then Cara put him down on the floor so she could take a few pictures. It was then that he saw his moment.’

Cecil is said to have spotted an air-conditioning pipe poking out of the floor.

‘Before anyone could do anything he had launched his back paws and scuttled over to it,’ the source said.

‘The last thing anyone saw was the disappearing tail. He didn’t get very far because he got stuck under the floor.’

Horrified staff called for the urgent assistance of maintenance men, who were forced to remove a number of floor vents so the pet could be rescued – much to Miss Delevingne’s relief.

The 21-year-old supermodel, who has posed for Burberry, Mulberry and Chanel, is known for her rather eccentric habits. Lately these have included carting Cecil to meetings in a bunny box.

She introduced ‘Cecil Bunny Delevingne’ to the world last Wednesday. He has since been photographed with his famous ‘aunties’ – her sister Poppy Delevingne as well as her friend, the singer Rita Ora. He has also been pictured frolicking around the streets of London, sitting in front of a computer keyboard and showing off his taste for Chanel.

The supermodel and her famous friends are known for their obsession with social media. Cara has 5.38million followers on the photo-sharing website Instagram.

On May 14, she sent a tweet that said ‘Meet my new bunny @cecildelevingne.’

He has also been pictured frolicking around the streets of London, sitting in front of a Mac keyboard and showing off his taste for Chanel.

At the Cannes film festival last week Miss Delevigne - who is also an aspiring actress - arrived at the De Grisogono dinner party at Hotel du Cap-Eden Roc, in a Roberto Cavalli dress showing off a new intricate tattoo on the back of her neck.

She made her debut as Princess Sorokina in Anna Karenina in 2012, and has already starred in three films which are due for release in 2014 - Kids in Love, London Fields and The Face of an Angel.

After the Mulberry meeting Delevingne went on to a rehearsal for sister Poppy’s wedding at St Paul’s Church in Knightsbridge, London which took place later that week.

Tweeting celebrity pets do not have a good track record in terms of their own mortality.

Cecil’s dash for freedom had similarities with the sad passing of Alan, the in-house dachshund of magazine Tatler in central London.

Last year it had become distracted by a passing jogger and make a dash for it, through a revolving door, but sadly, it didn’t make it through to the other side.

This despite the best efforts of two fire engines and 10 firemen.
