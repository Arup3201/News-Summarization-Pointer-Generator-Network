If a wealthy American golf fanatic fancies having 'The Whitehouse' as their home address, their dream could soon come true... but they'd have to relocate to Scotland first.

The remarkable 16,000sq ft property, in Gleneagles, Perthshire - on sale for £8million - has failed to find a buyer after seven months on the market.

Now, U.S. golf aficionados have been invited to purchase the 'Gatsby style' newly built property, which works out at £500 per sq ft.

The huge mansion lies in the grounds of
Gleneagles Hotel and is just a stone’s throw away from the 
world-renowned PGA Centenary golf course, which is hosting the 2014 
Ryder Cup.

American golf fans are being urged to buy their own Whitehouse as the most expensive newly built home in Scotland failed to be sold after seven months on the market

The remarkable 16,000sq ft property, in Gleneagles, Perthshire is on sale for £8million

The Whitehouse, which is expected to be fully furnished by next summer, is part of the exclusive gated community of Queens Crescent - known as 'Millionaires' Row' - a street that has an average house price of £1.18million

And if it goes for the asking price, it will make it the most expensive home in Scotland.

Smiths Gore has advertised the mansion in stateside golf magazines as a 'relative bargain' and the 'ideal' Ryder Cup home that will make the new owner the 'envy of all their friends'.

John Coleman, of Smiths Gore, revealed 
that their advertising campaign was starting to pay dividends after a 
big response from buyers across the pond.

Once completed, the Whitehouse will have three living rooms, six en-suite bedrooms, a swimming pool, cinema, gym, orangery and staff accommodation

He said: 'The five-star award-winning Gleneagles resort attracts visitors and celebrities from all around the world to play its famous golf courses and playing host to the Ryder Cup in 2014 has enhanced its appeal.

'Since the Ryder Cup last month, we have received dozens of phone calls from prospective American buyers.

'We now need to see if they will actually follow up and come over here to view for themselves.'

Once completed, the Whitehouse will have three living rooms, six en-suite bedrooms, a swimming pool, cinema, gym, orangery and staff accommodation.

Also thrown into the bargain is a two-year family membership to the Gleneagles Golf and Leisure Club.
