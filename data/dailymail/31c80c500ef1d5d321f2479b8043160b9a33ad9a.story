Apple has faced criticism over the past week for copying many Android features on its larger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but it appears this imitation goes both ways.

Just days after Apple added encryption by default to iOS 8, Google has announced its next-generation Android software will equally prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information.

As with Apple’s security tool, only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running Android L will be able to access the files on it.

Google is set to release its Android L software (pictured left) next month. Once installed, it will encrypt data by default, and only people with the device or smartwatch's (Moto 360 pictured right) password will be able to access the files - preventing the police and governments getting access to it using a search warrant

As with Apple, this means that if search warrants are served on Google for the customer's information, it won't legally be able to get hold of it.

Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of Android Jelly Bean.

Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature on Android Jelly Bean. 

However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed.

To enable encryption on devices running Android KitKat or Jelly Bean, plug the phone or tablet into charge.

Make sure the device remains connected to the power cable throughout. 

Go to Setting, Security and select Screen Lock. 

Choose a PIN or password and follow the steps. 

Select the Encrypt option when prompted.

Encryption can take up to an hour, depending on how many files are stored on the device. 

However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed.

Any devices that upgrade to Android L next month will have this tool turned on by default, but it can’t be disabled.

‘As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on, ’ said Google’s director of global communications and public affairs Niki Christoff.

‘For over three years Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.’

Earlier this week, Apple launched a new Privacy page, and the firm's chief executive Tim Cook wrote an open letter to customers. 

Mr Cook said: ‘At Apple, your trust means everything to us.

'We’re publishing this website to explain how we handle your personal information, what we do and don’t collect, and why.

‘A few years ago, users of internet services began to realise that when an online service is free, you’re not the customer. You’re the product.

‘But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn’t come at the expense of your privacy.’

According to Apple's new privacy site, on devices running iOS 8, personal data including photos, messages - including attachments - email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders are placed under the protection of a user’s passcode.

‘Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,’ continued the firm.

‘So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8.

In March, Google published a video that detailed the process it takes when responding to search warrants from law enforcement officers and governments (screengrab pictured). Under the new rules, Google will be able to legally decline requests for any information protected by a passcode, by default

The reference to competitors is believed to have been an attack on Google, which the firm has countered with its Android L encryption announcement today.

The rollout of new software to Google devices, however, is significantly slower than Apple.

Apple can push updates to every device because it owns the hardware, but Android runs on the devices of multiple manufacturers, which will have to roll out Android L individually.

This could take months, if not years.  

And data stored on Google Drive, as with iCloud, is not encrypted automatically, so could still be retrieved with the appropriate warrant.
