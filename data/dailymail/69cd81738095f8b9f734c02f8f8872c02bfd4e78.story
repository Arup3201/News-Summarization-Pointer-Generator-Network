A stalwart of British entertainment it may be, but a ratings grabber?

Radio 4 has steamed ahead of Radio 1 for the second time in six months in quarterly Rajar listening figures.

The refined BBC station is trading on familiar names such as Today, Woman’s Hour and The Archers to edge in front of the more populist Radio 1.

Before this year, the station had not lost out to Radio 4 for a decade.

A key battleground is the flagship breakfast slot, where Radio 4’s Today show continues to perform well.

At Radio 1’s Breakfast Show, a bid to draw young listeners saw Chris Moyles, 39, dropped in favour of 29-year-old DJ Nick Grimshaw last year.

Since taking over, the presenter has lost more than 1.1million listeners, leaving him 1.2million behind Today.

The show’s audience has slumped to 5.6million, the lowest in a decade.

Grimshaw also trails Radio 2 rival Chris Evans by 3.8million listeners – four years ago the shows were almost neck and neck.

Radio 4’s average listener is 55, and it has 10.9million listeners a week.

At Radio 1, the average age is 32, but it had an audience of just 10.8million a week in the last quarter.

Radio 2 still has the UK’s biggest audience at 14.94million a week.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘While Radio 1’s audience has held up through the biggest set of changes for a generation as it focuses on younger listeners, Radio 4 has seen its popularity reach new heights.’
