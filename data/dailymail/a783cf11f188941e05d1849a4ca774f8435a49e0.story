Southampton are preparing to offer England's man of the moment Nathaniel Clyne a new deal as part of a contract renewal drive.

The Saints want to tie Clyne, as well as Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez, down to fresh contracts.

Clyne and Rodriguez's deals expire at the end of next season and the south-coast club are understandably keen to secure the England duo's long-term futures.

Right back Clyne has been one of the club's star performers so far this season; his form culminating in his first two England caps against Slovenia and Scotland.

The ex-Crystal Palace defender impressed in both matches, leading to calls for the 23-year-old to be installed as Roy Hodgson's first-choice right back.

Southampton have long viewed Clyne as their long-term right back; their decision to sell Calum Chambers to Arsenal in the summer was testament to that.

Formal talks over a fresh terms are yet to begin, but the Saints intend to show their commitment to Clyne by initiating discussions in the coming weeks.

Clyne is likely to attract interest from rival clubs next summer, with Liverpool understood to be monitoring his progress.

But Southampton want to avoid any uncertainty over his future by signing the England international to an improved deal.

Likewise, Southampton want Rodriguez to sign a new five-year contract as they seek to keep him from Tottenham's clutches in January.

Mauricio Pochettino has made Rodriguez - who hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury - a priority signing once the transfer window reopens.

Morgan Schneiderlin is among high-flying Southampton stars the club is keen to make a fixture  

Jay Rodriguez, who hasn't played since April, is top of Mauricio Pochettino's list at Tottenham

But the Saints want the striker to snub his former boss and commit to a new deal.

Extending Schneiderlin's contract is not as urgent for Southampton given his current deal does not expire until the summer of 2017.

Nevertheless, the France international will be offered an improved deal on his existing £30,000-per-week terms.

Arsenal and Tottenham have both shown a firm interest in the 25-year-old, but Southampton hope they can persuade Schneiderlin to commit his future to the club he joined in 2008.
