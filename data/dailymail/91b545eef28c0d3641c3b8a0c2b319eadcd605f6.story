They are, of course, there to help raise money for charity. But some of the stars of this year’s Children in Need have been accused of also using it as a convenient opportunity to raise their own profiles.

Viewers have criticised a string of singers for ‘shamelessly’ promoting their albums and tour dates during the BBC1 fundraising appeal last Friday.

The programme was watched by 8.3 million and raised a record £32.6 million for disadvantaged children and young adults.

Viewers have criticised a string of singers, including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (pictureD) for ‘shamelessly’ promoting their albums and tour dates during the BBC1 fundraising appeal last Friday

It featured performances by One Direction, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Katherine Jenkins and the recently reformed pop group S Club 7 – all of whom have new singles, albums or tours to promote. 

The musicians’ appearances prompted derision online, with viewers accusing them of hiding their self-promotion ‘behind a veil of charity’.

Mrs Fernandez-Versini, 31, performed her new single Only Human, while One Direction performed Night Changes, released that very evening. 

One Twitter user wrote: ‘One Direction using Children In Need as a shameless plug for their new single #ShameOnYou.’

Miss Jenkins, 34, sang a track from her new album Home Sweet Home. 

Two days after their Children in Need appearance, the seven S Club 7 band members (pictured) announced a comeback arena tour that will take place next year

She also used a pre-performance interview to plug the record, gushing: ‘It’s my tenth album. I’ve no idea where the time’s gone and why I’ve been lucky enough to make ten. 

'It’s kind of like a full circle - it is paying tribute to Wales but also going back to my classical roots.’ 

Gary Raymond tweeted: ‘Nice to see Katherine Jenkins taking a moment on Children in Need there to plug her new album #classy.’

Another primetime spot went to Noughties pop act S Club 7, who reunited to perform a medley of their greatest hits.

Two days after their Children in Need appearance, the seven band members, including former Strictly Come Dancing star Rachel Stevens, 36, announced a comeback arena tour that will take place next year.

Dan Cooper wrote online: ‘This is why I hate Children in Need. S Club 7 hiding behind a veil of charity to shamelessly expose and promote themselves for a tour.’

It wasn’t just the singers who were accused of underhanded tactics, either – for one of the night’s presenters came under fire, too. EastEnders actor Shane Richie was accused of using his influence to promote his son Jake Roche’s band Rixton.

The group performed their new song Wait On Me on Friday, prompting one viewer to tweet: ‘Thought Children in Need was about raising money for children’s charities, not an excuse for Shane Ritchie to plug his son’s band!!!’

Deirdre Halliwell asked: ‘Is there anyone on Children in Need this year who isn’t promoting something?’

A third viewer suggested that the charity drive was now an event ‘when all the “generous pop bands” give up their time to shamelessly plug their latest records’.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are incredibly grateful to all the celebrities who took part in Friday’s show, giving their time for free to help raise millions of pounds for disadvantaged children across the UK.

‘This year’s night of fundraising raised a record-breaking £32.6 million; everyone who played their part should be proud knowing that they have made a difference.’
