He sees you when you're sleeping and knows when you're awake. 

But Santa Claus didn't spot the secret camera that was set up to film him as he delivered presents to one young American boy and his family. 

Seven-year-old Evan readied the small device to capture what happened in his living room once everyone had gone to sleep on Christmas Eve. 

Christmas miracle: Seven-year-old Evan, right, can't believe what the camera captured after he went to sleep

The next morning, after presents were opened, he and his family gathered around the computer to see whether Santa Claus had visited - with a second camera recording Evan's face as he watched.

A clip of both videos - played alongside each other - was posted online by a member of Evan's family.

The video starts with Evan's older brother setting up his GoPro camera in the empty living room. 

The seven-year-old becomes increasingly doubtful when nothing appears as the camera speeds through hours of footage from the room.

Jingle bells: The boy's face lights up as he hears what sounds like hooves and footsteps on the roof

Magic: Evan's eys are fixed on the screen as a kitchen light switches on and a cloud of smoke appears

One family member suggests that perhaps the camera didn't capture anything, while another says that Santa Claus needs to be sure that everyone is asleep. 

But then Evan hears the distant jingle of bells and stomp of reindeer hooves. 

He looks around excitedly and claps his hands - in disbelief that Father Christmas is so close. 

And just as his family start saying that maybe it was only sound that was captured, the man in the red suit appears in a burst of magical smoke.

Snack time: He giggles with his family as they watch Father Christmas munch on cookies left out for him

Wish list: With a click of his fingers, Santa makes the presents appear under the tree in a cloud of sparkle

Evan squeals with delight as he watches Santa enjoying the milk and cookies left out for him.

Santa then turns towards the Christmas tree and snaps his fingers - making an impressive pile of perfectly-wrapped presents appear in a cloud of sparkle. 

Just after Evan remarks that Santa Claus hasn't noticed the camera, the man turns to face the camera, snaps his fingers, and the screen goes dark. 

The seven-year-old can hardly contain his glee - high-fiving his family and talking excitedly about what he just saw. He adds that he hope Santa doesn't put them on the naughty list for filming him.
