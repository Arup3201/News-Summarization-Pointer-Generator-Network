He has battled raging ocean storms during a solo and unaided 2,700 mile voyage across the Atlantic and became the first disabled person to sail single-handed around Britain, all while confined to a wheelchair.

Having never let his disability get in the way, Geoff Holt was appalled when a guard told him he could not board a train because his electric wheelchair would damage the floor.

Furious Mr Holt, 45, said he could not 
recall the last time he was so upset and angry after the incident on the
Island Line's three-minute Ryde Pier to Ryde Esplanade service on the 
Isle of Wight on Saturday.

Triumphant: Geoff Holt contended with storms and ferocious seas during his solo 2-700 mile voyage across the Atlantic ocean

To his horror, he said, ‘in typical British fashion’, no passenger came to his aid as he argued with the guard.

The
unnamed guard has now been suspended pending an investigation and a 
senior manager has apologised, the ‘horrified’ train operator has 
confirmed.

British Transport Police also said they were investigating after Mr Holt reported suffering cuts when ramp stored on the train was thrown onto the platform, hitting his foot and leg in the process.

Writing
on his blog, the award-winning sailor, who champions disability issues 
and was awarded an MBE in 2010, said: ‘I can't recall the last time that
I was so angry and upset I was physically shaking, emotion choking my 
voice, a sense of genuine rage.

‘So
why the rage? Quite simply, a guard on the train, specifically "Guard 
1003" as he reluctantly identified himself when pressed, refused to let 
me board the 4.45pm train - the same journey I had made nine hours 
earlier.

Record-breaker: Geoff Holt became the first disabled person ever to circumnavigate Great Britain in 2007

‘Why? To quote Guard 1003, pointing at
my wheelchair, “those things aren't allowed on these trains, they will 
damage the floors”.

‘I couldn't quite believe what I heard and asked him to repeat it, which he did.

‘Reminding
myself this was 2012, not 1912, this was public transport and this was 
the year the Paralympics were coming to Britain, the red mist was 
descending.

‘Expanding his 
fictional list of reasons why I could not travel, he then said, if he 
got me on this train, there was no guarantees I could get off three 
minutes later (at) the same station I had successfully travelled from 
earlier that morning.

‘Trying
to intimidate me, he said I might have to stay on the train to 
Shanklin, over 12 miles away.

'When I said I had made the journey hours 
earlier, he said, and I quote: “Rubbish, you would not have been allowed
to board the train”.

‘Eventually,
after several minutes of his posturing, huffing and puffing, Guard 1003
lifted the tiny ramp stored on the train and, quite literally, threw it
on the platform, hitting my foot and leg in the process (when I got 
home, I found it was grazed and bleeding, I did not know this at the 
time because I can't feel it).

Determined: Geoff Holt competed in the Round Britain Adventure in a Challenger Trimaran despite being disabled in a swimming accident that left him handicapped

‘And with that simple, easy manoeuvre, which took him only 10 seconds, I was on the train, Guard 1003 snarling at me like some prison guard. All the other passengers looked on in disbelief but, in typical British fashion did nothing.’

Mr Holt has been in a wheelchair since a swimming accident 28 years ago in the Caribbean and he completed his 2,700-mile transatlantic sail in 2010 finishing at the site of his 1984 accident.

The father-of-one added: ‘He had publicly humiliated me, he had publicly degraded me and he had made me feel like a worthless piece of dirt... it was quite simply the most disgusting way to treat another human being, let alone a disabled one.’

Island Line refused to confirm that 'Guard 1003' - as identified by Mr Holt - had been suspended.

But a spokesman said: ‘We are absolutely horrified at the events Mr Holt has described. We welcome electric wheelchairs on our services and it is very important to us that all of our passengers feel welcome on our network.

‘We are taking this matter very seriously and have already launched an investigation. A senior manager has contacted Mr Holt directly to apologise.

‘We can also confirm that one of our employees has been suspended while our investigation is under way.’
