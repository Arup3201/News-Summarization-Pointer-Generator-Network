A tiger is recovering from dental work at a zoo after breaking three of his front teeth.

Nine-year-old Amir, a rare male Sumatran tiger, had to have the chipped teeth filled in at Howletts Wild Animal Park near Canterbury, Kent.

The tiger, who weighs more than 20 stone, was sedated and transported to the on-site hospital for treatment by dental surgeon Peter Kertesz.

Ben Warren, head of the carnivore section at Howletts, said it was decided to fill the affected teeth, including Amir's right upper canine, to prevent any pain occurring.

He said: 'Amir is a lovely tiger and although the broken teeth weren't causing him any discomfort, we knew that a filling would be the best course of action to prevent any deterioration.'

Jane Hopper, head of veterinary services at Howletts, said: 'This is a difficult procedure in a tiger as the canine tooth's root can be six times longer in a tiger than a human.'
