It was one of the most thrilling cliffhangers in modern television.

Now the man behind the BBC's hit revival of Sherlock Holmes, has added to the suspense of how the detective faked his own death at the end of the last series by giving three clues about the new run.

In a speech at the Edinburgh TV Festival, show creator Steven Moffat announced three words which are hints about series three.

Elementary? The creator of BBC's hit revival of Sherlock Holmes, 
starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson, 
has left a tantalising clue as to how the detective faked his own death

He said: 'These three words might be a title, it might be a clue. They are Rat. Wedding. Bow.'

The
show, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Watson is one of the BBC’s biggest hits 
but the cryptic ending to series two has kept viewers guessing.

Mystery man: The show's writer Steven Moffat

Millions watched the series back on BBC iPlayer to try and uncover clues as to how Holmes was able to fake his own death.

Moffat
has repeatedly added to the suspense by posting comments and hints on 
Twitter such as telling fans that a clue is in the fact that Holmes did 
'something out of character”.

He added: ‘So many people theorising – and they missed it.’

One
fan wrote on his blog Barefoot on Baker Street: ‘Moffat has revealed 
that fans have ‘missed a vital clue’ – which has made us all turn to BBC
iplayer, Sky Plus etc and watch the whole thing again in the hope of 
being the one to solve the mystery, a mystery worthy of the great 
detective himself.

The 
episode, entitled The Reichenbach Fall, was based on the 1893 Arthur 
Conan Doyle book The Final Problem, in which the author famously killed 
off the eccentric detective.

Viewers watched Holmes view his own 
funeral from a distance after minutes earlier appearing to leap to his 
death from a tower block.

Within
minutes social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook were 
flooded with fans offering conspiracy theories and explanations.

Many admitted they had watched the episodes repeatedly to try and work out how he could have survived.

Although more than eight million watched the programme on television, the average number of iPlayer requests across the series topped 2 million per show, making it one of the most requested shows on the service.

Last year Moffat released three words to give hints about series two, they were Adler, hound and Reichenbach - relating to the key plots of each episode.
