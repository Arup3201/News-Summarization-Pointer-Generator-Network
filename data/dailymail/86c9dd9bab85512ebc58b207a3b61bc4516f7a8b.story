Two British medical students were stabbed to death in Malaysia yesterday following an argument in a bar.

Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22, were reportedly knifed by a mob of local men who were high on drugs and had accused the Britons of being too noisy.

The fourth-year Newcastle University students had been due to fly home tomorrow following a six-week placement caring for patients at a hospital in Kuching on the island of Borneo.

Malaysian police said they were pounced on in the street after being tailed by a car as they walked home following the bar row.

Last night, as tributes poured in for 
the ‘highly committed’ aspiring doctors, officers said they had arrested
 three suspects who could now face the death penalty. A fourth was still
 at large.

The devastated families of Mr Brunger and Mr Dalton were informed of their deaths yesterday.

They had been staying at the 
£4-a-night Singgahsana backpacker hostel and putting their medical 
studies into practice during the summer secondment to Sarawak General 
Hospital.

The attack happened at 4.15am local 
time following a row in a city centre bar over the students being too 
noisy, said Sarawak deputy police commissioner Chai Khin Chung.

The tropical island paradise of Borneo is the third largest island in the world, and the largest in Asia.

Control is divided between Malaysia and Brunei in the north and Indonesia in the south. 

Surrounded by the South China Sea, 
its varied scenery including mountains, beaches and rainforest make it a
 prime spot for diving, trekking and encounters with endangered 
wildlife.

Cheap and direct flights from all 
over central Asia have put it firmly on the tourist trail, and around 
450,000 Britons visit each year.

In 2012, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the island during the Jubilee tour.

Kuching is the third largest city, 
with a population of about 600,000. It is located in the Malaysian 
controlled province of Sarawak.

British tourists have been warned 
by the Foreign Office to avoid travel to certain parts of Borneo, 
following clashes between militants and Malaysian armed forces in the 
Sabah region. But outside this, crime levels on the island are low.

‘The four suspects came in [to the 
bar] and sat nearby,’ he told a press conference. ‘The two foreigners 
were quarrelling amongst themselves, and very noisy.

‘So these four are sitting nearby and 
then they told the two gentlemen not to be so noisy, and then the fight 
started. After that the two foreigners left the pub, the four followed 
from behind with a car.’

One of the men, a 23-year-old 
fishmonger, then got out and began stabbing the victims in the chest and
 back, Malaysian media reported.

He and his accomplices fled, leaving the students lying in the street.

Police were called by a restaurant 
owner who witnessed the attack. Officers raided the homes of three 
suspects, seizing a car and a knife less than two hours later.

The suspects, aged 19, 23 and 29, all 
reportedly tested positive for drugs. They have been remanded in custody
 for seven days. A police spokesman described the case as ‘solved’.

Before attending university, 
high-flying Mr Dalton achieved four A* grades at A-Level in maths, 
chemistry, physics and general studies, at Belper School in Derbyshire.

He was also a keen cricketer and had 
played for Belper Amateurs for several years. Family friend Sue Bartley,
 50, said: ‘He was very self-motivated and you would often see him 
running and cycling.

‘He really was the brightest, the 
best, the most intelligent and self-motivated. He had always said that 
he wanted to be a doctor, and he studied very hard. He was a true 
gentleman.’

The murdered medical students went to Borneo to spend their summer holiday treating hospital patients.

They were among a group of seven young medics from Newcastle University keen to put their studies into practice.

Their trip, which it is likely they would have had to fund at least partially themselves, came after four years of learning medical theory in lectures and tutorials. It was a golden opportunity to get hands-on practice while also helping to treat people in a developing country.

Professor Jane Calvert, Dean of Undergraduate Studies for Newcastle University Medical School, said of Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger: ‘They were doing what thousands of medical students do every year, they were on an elective to experience clinical practice in a different setting, to learn from that and enhance their practice when they came back.

‘I didn’t know them personally but they were well-known by the programme director and teachers on the course and we are all so shocked and saddened by this.

‘For all our students going on elective, all the risks are looked at and we’re very careful not to let them go to places that are known to be of high risk. Where they were working is a very nice place – I was there myself earlier in the year and I was especially shocked to hear it had happened there.’

Students doing work experience at a hospital in a developing country are often given more responsibility than they would expect to get in the UK. Organisations involved in arranging similar medical work placements for students say it is a challenging but greatly rewarding experience.

One such company tells students looking to apply: ‘Working in a hospital overseas is a great experience, not only because of the close up clinical experience you will receive.

‘It is also a great way to learn about healthcare in other countries and to observe the ethical dilemmas doctors face day-to-day in less well-funded hospitals around the globe.

‘The cases you will observe will also differ from what you would generally see at home. Typhoid, dengue fever, tuberculosis and malaria are all a good contrast to what you might find in your local hospital.’

After a placement, students are usually free to travel around and explore whichever country they are in.

The family of Mr Dalton, whose father is thought to be a teacher, were too upset to speak yesterday.

His former headmaster at Belper School, Martyn Cooper, said: ‘Neil was always a fully engaged and promising student.

‘Our memories of him are of a vibrant and interested young man, who enjoyed his studies and made contributions to many events.

‘He was a particularly-able mathematician, winning several awards during his school years.’

Mr Brunger lived with his mother and 
stepfather who runs a local car dealership in Gillingham, Kent. 
Neighbours said the news has ‘shocked the entire street’.

One, who did not want to be 
identified, said: ‘He was such a lovely little boy, just about to start 
his life in such a meaningful way.’

Professor Jane Calvert, of Newcastle 
University Medical School, said: ‘They were excellent students. They 
were doing really well with their studies.

‘They were highly committed and coming
 back next year to work as doctors. Aidan was aspiring to do some 
medical research on his return, Neil was going straight in to his final 
year. It’s such a tragic thing to occur.’

A third British medical student, Niall Durkan, 23, was with the group in Sarawak but not present when the attack happened.

A relative said the student called 
home ‘in a bit of a state’ in the early hours. She added: ‘Niall called 
his mother and told her that he wasn’t with the two boys at the time.

‘Apparently Niall and some of the 
others left the two victims in a club or somewhere, and from there they 
went on to this bar where the attack broke out.

‘The first Niall knew about it was 
when the police knocked on his door. They were looking for an iPad, 
presumably belonging to one of the victims.

‘He asked why they wanted it and they just told him it was in connection with their murder investigation.

‘Niall had been having a great time out there before this happened. I think they were finishing at the hospital this week.’

The Foreign Office said it was aware of the deaths and providing consular assistance to the students’ families.

In May British accountant Gareth Huntley disappeared from his lodgings on Tioman Island, off the Malaysian peninsula.

The 34-year-old, who was working as a 
volunteer on a turtle conservation project, vanished after setting out 
to walk a jungle trail.

It took more than a week for the authorities to find his body. His throat had been cut.
