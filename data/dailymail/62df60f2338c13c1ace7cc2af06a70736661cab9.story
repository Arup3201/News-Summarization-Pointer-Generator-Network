A £900billion bailout for the crisis-torn eurozone was unveiled yesterday in a last-ditch bid to kick-start growth.

The European Central Bank outlined a massive money-printing programme known as quantitative easing as it stepped up the fight against deflation and stagnation.

The central bank will create nearly £46billion of extra cash every month between March this year and September next year – a total of almost £900billion.

The landmark decision – which will see the ECB buy government and corporate bonds across the 19 countries of the single currency bloc – is intended to cut borrowing costs and boost lending to families and businesses.

The prospect of billions of euros flooding into the system sent the euro tumbling on the foreign exchange markets – a move the ECB hopes will boost exports by making goods produced in the eurozone cheaper for foreign buyers.

Sterling quickly hit a seven-year high against the euro, with £1 buying 1.32 euros. This makes European holidays cheaper for British tourists, but it also makes British exports to Europe more expensive, so less competitive.

The health of the eurozone is crucial to Britain because it is the UK’s largest trading partner and can have a huge impact on confidence on this side of the Channel.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, George Osborne said it was ‘welcome action’ from the ECB ‘but not sufficient for a European recovery’.

Calling on European governments to grasp the nettle, the Chancellor added: ‘We want to see this accompanied by clear plans to make the European continent more competitive, to back business in Europe, to create jobs and to make sure public finances are in order.

‘Now we have all those ingredients in the UK and that is why our economic plan is delivering a strong economic recovery. 

'We want to see all those ingredients in place on the European continent so that the whole of Europe recovers.

‘The fact that the ECB had to take this drastic action shows the European economy is much weaker than the UK economy and it’s also a warning to Britain of the risks that lie ahead if we were to abandon our long term economic plan.’

ECB president Mario Draghi (pictured) described the QE programme as ‘very large’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent

Unemployment is already stubbornly high at 11.5 per cent in the single currency bloc compared with 5.8 per cent in the UK.

Around a quarter of Greeks and Spaniards who want work cannot find a job including half of those under the age of 25.

This crisis has sparked fears of a ‘lost generation’ in the eurozone and experts believe it risks a rise in extremist parties – such as the radical Left-wing, anti-austerity Syriza party, which is leading the polls ahead of elections in Greece on Sunday.

Eurozone leaders hope that by kick-starting growth the QE programme will prevent a repeat of the riots that have been seen in Greece, Spain and elsewhere against austerity measures, which were introduced to try to tackle the debt crisis

Germany has long opposed QE in the eurozone amid concerns in Berlin that it amounts to bailout for spendthrift countries and could encourage governments to renege on economic reforms.

What is quantitative easing?

QE is the method used by central banks to stimulate growth in an ailing economy when all else – including slashing interest rates – fails. 

It involves the creation of new money to be injected into ailing economies to stimulate growth. It is sometimes called printing money but no hard cash is actually printed. Transactions are largely electronic.

How does it work?

The central bank uses its newly-created ‘money’ to buy bonds from banks and other institutions, increasing the amount of cash in the financial system. 

In theory this inflow of money encourages cash-rich banks to lend more to business and individuals, enabling companies to expand and people to spend more. This should generate more jobs.

Who’s done it before?

The Bank of England launched a £375billion QE programme in March 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis and the US Federal Reserve has bought bonds worth $3.7 trillion (£2.4 trillion) since starting QE in 2008.

Both have now wound down the programme because their economies have improved.

Has it worked?

It depends who you ask. The Bank of England estimates that its QE programme helped increase the UK’s annual economic output by between 1.5pc and 2pc. Homeowners have benefited, as mortgage rates have fallen to record lows. 

But QE has been a disaster for millions of pensioners because it has pushed down savings and annuity rates, which determine their annual retirement income. Banks have also hoarded much of the money they have received instead of lending it.

What about the eurozone?

The European Central Bank’s new QE plan – which will pour around £900billion into the eurozone’s banking system over 20 months – is intended to prevent deflation and address appalling levels of unemployment and economic growth. 

Deflation – or negative inflation – is when prices fall year on year. This usually leads to a fall in incomes and thus tax revenues. 

Deflation also means debt becomes more expensive to service and people are reluctant to spend money, believing prices will fall further.

Will it work in Europe?

It should help, but some experts fear its impact may be limited when the £900billion is spread across 19 countries. 

The cash might also cause troubled economies such as France and Greece to delay reforming their labour markets and cutting borrowing and debt.

How does it affect the UK?

The pound is likely to strengthen significantly against the euro. This is good for holidaymakers, but bad for exports because UK goods and services will become more expensive abroad. 

In the long run it should help Britain if the eurozone – our biggest export market – is shaken out of its torpor.

Eurozone countries will have to apply to the ECB if they want to take advantage of the stimulus package. 

The amount of new money available to each nation is yet to be calculated, but the ECB has stipulated that it will not buy bonds equivalent to more than one-third of a country’s debt.

ECB president Mario Draghi described the QE programme as ‘very large’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent – raising the prospect of it lasting beyond September next year.

‘We believe that the measures will be effective, will raise medium term inflation expectations and will address the economic situation in the euro area,’ he said at the ECB’s headquarters in Frankfurt.

But British business leaders warned that Mr Draghi’s proposals could be ‘too little too late’.

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The ECB’s QE programme is unlikely to solve the fundamental challenges facing the eurozone, which needs sweeping structural changes to return to health.’
