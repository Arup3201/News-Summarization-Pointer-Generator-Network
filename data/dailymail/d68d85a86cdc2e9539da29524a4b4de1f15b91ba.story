One of Diana, Princess of Wales's favourite dresses is to go on show as part of a glittering display of ballgowns at the V&A.

The South Kensington museum is set to unveil the new exhibition, charting six decades of lavish British style, later this month.

Ballgowns: British Glamour Since 1950 will feature more than sixty designs created for glittering social events over the past 60 years, from all sorts of events, taking in private parties, Royal balls, state occasions and star-studded premieres.

History: Diana dubbed this Catherine Walker dress the 'Elvis'. Studded with 20,000 pearls, Diana loved it so much that she wore it on a tour of Hong Kong in 1989, then shortly afterwards to the British Fashion Awards

The exhibition, to be located in the V&A's newly renovated Fashion Galleries, is a stunning display of
beautiful ballgowns worn by Royal debutantes, show-stopping red carpet 
dresses that sparked a thousand flashbulbs, and high fashion catwalk 
creations.

Eveningwear comes from designers past
and present, and is set to include pieces from the archives of 
Catherine Walker, Hardy Amies, Victor Stiebel and Zanda Rhodes.

Visitors will be able to see a pink silk
gown from The House Of Worth, a couture house established in Paris in 
1858 by Charles Frederick Worth, and considered to be the original and 
founding couture house.

The company, who also had the offshoot 
Worth London, created refined garments for a mainly English clientele 
for the London social season, with subtle shades of champagne and rose 
their trademark.

Elsewhere, there is work 
from Jonathan Saunders and Hussein Chalayan, and fresh from the catwalks
will be works from the breathtaking collections of Alexander McQueen, Giles Deacon, Erdem and Jenny Packham.

A selection of royal ballgowns will 
be on display, including the white pearl-studded gown designed by 
Catherine Walker for Diana, Princess of Wales. Diana dubbed the garment,
studded with 20,000 pearls, the 'Elvis Dress', thanks to the fact it 
was inspired by the late singer's stage costumes.

She loved the dress so much that she 
wore it twice, once on an official tour of Hong Kong in 1989, and 
shortly afterwards to the British Fashion Awards in London.

Elsewhere in the royal collection is a
Norman Hartnell gown designed for Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and gowns
worn by today’s young royals.

Ballgowns: British Glamour Since 1950
will also include dresses worn by actresses and celebrities including 
Elizabeth Hurley, Bianca Jagger and Sandra Bullock, and a stunning 
metallic leather dress created especially for the exhibition by 
innovative designer Gareth Pugh.
