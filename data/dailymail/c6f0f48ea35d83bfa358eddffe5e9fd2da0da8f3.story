The opening weekend of the NFL season concludes with a Monday Night Football double bill as the Detroit Lions entertain the New York Giants at Ford Field before the San Diego Chargers visit the Arizona Cardinals.

New York Giants at Detroit Lions

The London-bound Lions will be hoping they can finally win the NFC North. Last season, Detroit were in pole position to clinch the division, only to lose their final four games and miss out.

The addition of Golden Tate in free agency gives the Lions a legitimate target to go with of star wideout Calvin Johnson. Outside of Johnson, either a running back or tight end has posted the next highest total of receiving yards for the last four seasons (Joique Bell, 547 yards in 2013, Brandon Pettigrew 567 in yards 2012, 777 yards in 2011 and 722 yards in 2010). A potent passing game is complemented by the backfield duo of Reggie Bush and Joique Bell, who combined for 1656 rushing yards as well as 1053 receiving.

Questions remain over the secondary, with the passing defence surrendering an average of 246 yards per game. Any short comings in the secondary could be masked by the guys on the line. Both Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley have the talent to dominate, but either are prone to imploding mentally. Second year defensive end Ziggy Ansah is one to watch throughout the season, as the Lions look to improve on their pass rush.

The Giants bolstered their defense during the off-season with the addition of cornerbacks Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Walter Thurman, along with a fully fit Jason Pierre-Paul. Eli Manning will be looking to put behind him the struggles of last season, during which he threw a league leading 27 interceptions. Following the retirement of Kevin Gilbride, new offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, will look to reinvigorate Manning. However Eli has struggled to grasp McAdoo's system after several poor performances during pre-season.

Running back David Wilson was forced to retire during the off-season, and new addition Rashad Jennings is expected to carry the load, complemented by fourth round draft pick Andre Williams, who's caught the eye with some stout performances during pre-season.

San Diego Chargers at Arizona Cardinals

On a career upsurge: Philip Rivers

Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers enjoyed a career season last year in regards to his completion percentage. His 69.5% completion rate, tops his prior career best of 66% which came back in 2010. Add to that the 32 touchdown passes thrown, which was Rivers' highest total since the 2008 season (34) and for those keeping track his interception total also fell, down by four to 11 (lowest total since 2009). Keenan Allen was sensational last season, posting 1046 yards and eight touchdowns. Hype seems to building around young tight end Ladarius Green. Combine all that with the splash play ability of Malcom Floyd, the evergreen Antonio Gates along with the backfield of Ryan Mathews, Danny Woodhead and Donald Brown and the Chargers possess a deceptively explosive offense.

Defensive improvements have been made via the draft, with the addition of first round pick cornerback Jason Verrett, as the Chargers look to bolster a passing defense that short changed star safety Eric Weddle, giving up an average of 257.8 yards per game. The return of linebacker Melvin Ingram following a torn ACL is another huge boost for the defensive unit.

The Cardinals have been hit by a mixture of injury and free agency losses within this talented defense, resulting in many people believing that the team is set to decline in 2014, that would be foolish in my eyes, as the Cardinals made a couple of stout moves by acquiring both corner back Antonio Cromartie and left tackle Jared Veldeer via free agency. With one of the games premier shutdown corners Patrick Peterson and the return of Tryann Mathieu from an season ending injury the cards possess an excellent secondary.

Offensively, Carson Palmer is a solid veteran who has the potential to take the team to the play-offs. Bold statement I know but consider the weapons at his disposal, Larry Fitzgerald has looked like Super Bowl XLIII Fitzgerald during the pre-season, fellow wideout Michael Floyd is set for a breakout season, Troy Niklas a second round pick in this year’s draft is an excellent blocker and could prove to a vital outlet for Palmer. Another rookie to watch this season is the third round pick John Brown out of Pittsburgh State, his blazing speed gives the team not only a legitimate deep threat but an excellent weapon in the return game.
