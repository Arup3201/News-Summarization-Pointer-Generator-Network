Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear crew may have broken the law by switching number plates on his Porsche during their controversial trip to Argentina.

The TV show's presenters' convoy was attacked by locals armed with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles amid claims the H982 FKL number plates were a reference to the 1982 Falklands war.

Clarkson, 54, has insisted the plates' apparent reference to the conflict were an unfortunate coincidence and were changed as soon as it was noticed.

But the scandal engulfing the show deepened today when it emerged that by attaching the vehicle's previous number plates, Clarkson and his crew may have broken the law.

Argentine officials and newspapers took offence to Clarkson's number plate, which they said was a 'provocation' and a 'very big offence'. They claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 Falklands conflict

Records show the car - which last changed hands in August, weeks before the ill-fated trip - was registered as H982 FKL to the Porsche 928 featured in the show in 1991.

But it was later changed to H1 VAE - the registration plate later attached to the car in Argentina - by a previous owner in 2001, before being changed back.

Records suggest that the H1 VAE plate is now registered to another car in a UK, a Porsche 911 Turbo, and has been since 2006.

The DVLA today confirmed that it is an offence to drive a car 'in this country or abroad' under a plate assigned to a different vehicle.

A spokesman said: 'The UK rules are clear – a vehicle can only display a registration mark that is currently assigned to that vehicle.

'Failure to comply with these rules can result in a fine of up to £1,000 and enforcement of this offence would be a matter for the police.

'We would always advise motorists planning on taking a vehicle abroad to check the vehicle registration rules of the individual registration authorities.'

The BBC has said it is looking into the controversy but is unable to comment on the issue at present. 

It came as Clarkson claimed that Argentina allegedly told Chilean officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from the angry mob. 

Clarkson said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the Falklands War

The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road in Argentina before they fled across the border to Chile

The presenter said  they faced difficulty crossing into Chile when the Argentinians ordered that they were stopped.

He told The Sun: 'Their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally.

He added: ‘'Luckily for us, we’re really popular in Chile and they love the British so the official refused. In fact his direct quote was, “I told them, f*** you!”.’

Clarkson described the official as a ‘real hero’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into Chile.

He also accused the Argentinians of taking advantage of their visit for 'political capital' and said the violent protest was 'state-organised'.

‘The more I think about this, the more I’m convinced we were set up by the local government,’ he added. 

The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina. The crew later fled over the border to Chile

Jeremy Clarkson (pictured after landing at Heathrow) said the number plate was a complete coincidence

The drama unfolded when the Top Gear convoy was attacked with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the BBC motoring show.

Clarkson said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted: ‘This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'.

They were eventually forced to flee Argentina under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to 'kill' them. 

The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said.

The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991.

FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered.

The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA.

Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner.  

Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. 

They faced a gruelling six-hour journey to the Chilean border in a collection of hired 4x4s, trucks and the three 'star' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘car football match’ for the show.

They eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road, but a river, and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country.

Earlier, Clarkson took to Twitter to confirm that he, along with the rest of the Top Gear team, had not meant to cause offence with H982 FKL plate.

He wrote: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it.

'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths.

'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed.

'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong.

'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.'

Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman has told the Guardian: 'Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme,.

'To suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue.'

Clarkson took to Twitter upon returning to the UK to clarify that no offence was intended to be caused

April 2007 - Referring to a car made in Malaysia, he said it was built by 'jungle people who wear leaves as shoes'.

October 2009 - Claimed TV producers were obsessed with having 'black Muslim lesbians' on screen.

January 2012 - He compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004.

January 2012 - Clarkson mocked the clothing, trains and food in India, as he ridiculed the country's sanitation by driving a Jaguar fitted with a toilet through slums. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC about the comments.

March 2013 - The presenter joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had a 'slope on it'. The BBC later apologised but said it was not aware of the racist term at the time. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson had deliberately used racist language, but the BBC did not take action against him.

April 2014 - He took to Twitter to introduce his new dog - a black terrier he named Didier Dogba after the Ivory Coast and Chelsea footballer, Didier Drogba.

May 2014 - Clarkson was caught in a clip reciting the rhyme: 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe' before mumbling what sounded like 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Clarkson initially denied the incident but then backed down and said he was 'mortified' and 'horrified' when he realised it 'did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure'.
