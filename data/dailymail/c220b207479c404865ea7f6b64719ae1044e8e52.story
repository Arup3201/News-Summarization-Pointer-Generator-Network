Cleared: Chindamo, seen here after his release in 2008 for the murder of headmaster Philip Lawrence, has been acquitted by a jury for robbery

The killer of headmaster Philip Lawrence is set to spend at least another two years in prison, despite being cleared of robbery yesterday.

But Learco Chindamo, 31, will not be deported when he is finally released.

An immigration tribunal has ruled that Chindamo, who was born in Italy, could not be forced to leave because it would breach his human rights, in particular his ‘right to family life’.

This means the murderer will continue to be a drain on the British taxpayer.

Chindamo was controversially freed on licence in July last year after serving 14 years for the 1995 knife killing of Mr Lawrence.

Just four months later he was recalled to prison following his arrest for the alleged robbery.

He cannot be released from the recall until a decision by the Parole Board in the next few months.

However insiders believe he will be kept in prison for at least another two years because of breaches of his licence conditions, including associating with a former member of his Clockwork Orange-style gang, being on the streets in the early hours and drinking heavily.

At his trial Chindamo was accused of boasting about Mr Lawrence’s death to frighten 20-year-old David Sexton into handing over £20 he had just withdrawn from a cashpoint in Camden, north London. 

The thug claimed Mr Sexton ignited the row with drunken taunts of ‘killer’.

The clash, captured on CCTV, spiralled into a seven-minute argument which ended with Mr Sexton handing over £10 as a peace offering to Chindamo and his two  co-defendants, defence lawyers told the jury.

Chindamo was cleared of robbery with 
32-year-old Gregory Jananto, the ringleader of Chindamo’s gang which 
terrorised north London in the mid-1990s.

Jananto, of Shepherd’s Bush, west 
London, received an eight-year jail term for the near-fatal knife 
mugging of John Mills, husband of the then Director of Public 
Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, six months before Mr Lawrence’s murder.

While on bail for that offence, 
Jananto led a mob attack intended to terrorise a witness during 
Chindamo’s murder trial. For this he received an extra seven-year term.

Chindamo and Jananto hugged each 
other in the dock at London’s Blackfriars Crown Court after being 
cleared yesterday. The third defendant, Saeed Akhtar, 32, of King’s 
Cross, north London, was also cleared of robbery.

During his trial Chindamo spoke about
the murder of Mr Lawrence, 48, outside St George’s Roman Catholic 
School in Maida Vale. He said: ‘I know what I’ve done was a terrible 
thing. A horrible thing.’

Mr Lawrence’s widow, Frances, said: ‘I only wish Chindamo a happy and more productive life ahead.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said that Chindamo should remain in jail for the rest of his life.

He said: ‘Life should mean life for 
murder. Learco Chindamo didn’t have any concern for the family life of 
the Lawrence family when he killed Philip Lawrence.

‘He should never have been released from prison, and if released only so that he could be kicked out of the country.'

Learco Chindamo, seen here after being arrested for the headteacher's death in October 1996, has not been able to forget his reputation

Learco
Chindamo may have been cleared of robbery charges, but his name 
continues to stir feelings of anger among many who never knew him.

According to his peers, the murderer 
of headmaster Philip Lawrence is regularly recognised and insulted for 
the crime which shocked the nation in December 1995, bringing him 
instant notoriety at the age of 15.

Back in court at the age of 31 - 
after nearly 14 years behind bars - prosecutors painted a picture of a 
cold and calculating bully who used his conviction as a chilling weapon.

Sitting in the dock, the Italian-born defendant cut a cool and intense figure, showing no emotion.

There, he was reunited once again with Gregory Jananto - his co-defendant and former fellow gang-mate from their teenage years.

Back then, Chindamo was already a well-known figure.

A violent truant, he had managed to avoid an education almost completely and carried a knife as a matter of habit.

Instead of attending school, he preferred to live within his gang which roamed the burger bars and arcades of west London.

They modelled themselves on Triads and called themselves the Wo Sing Wo, or Street Warriors.

On Friday December 8 1995, at the age
of 15, he and other members of the posse found themselves at the gates 
of St George's School, where they planned to attack a boy who had 
quarrelled with a Filipino pupil.

Mr Lawrence saw what was happening 
and went to the 13-year-old's aid, bringing him face to face with 
Chindamo, who responded with kicks and punches.

He was stabbed fatally in the heart with a single blow of Chindamo's knife.

Within hours of the attack, the 
teenage aggressor was back at one of his regular haunts, an amusement 
arcade in London's West End, boasting about what he had done.

At the same time, Mr Lawrence was in hospital. He died at midnight.

The contrast between the 48-year-old 
teacher - a pillar of his community and a widely-respected 
educationalist - and his killer could hardly have been more striking.

Mr Lawrence prized discipline and 
took a fierce pride in the standards of St George's Catholic School in 
Maida Vale, west London, and the achievements of its students.

As a teacher and headmaster, his life was dedicated to ensuring his pupils were given every opportunity.

Privately, he was first and foremost a
family man, devoted to his wife Frances, also a teacher, and their four
children, and played an active role in the life of the Catholic parish 
at his home in Ealing, west London.

After his death, Mrs Lawrence was to say she had been deprived of her 'rock'.

Chindamo, who came to Britain aged 
six, was jailed indefinitely for the murder in 1996 and ordered to serve
a minimum term of 12 years.

In 2007 the youth, whose mother is 
Filipino and father Italian, became the subject of further outrage when a
court ruled he could not be deported on release because he had family 
in London.

Official papers handed to the courts at around the same time revealed he posed a 'genuine and present risk' to the public.

Mrs Lawrence protested strongly 
against the decision and said she faced a campaign of intimidation to 
warn her against speaking out.

She went on to say the authorities 
would not inform her where Chindamo was living and felt his rights 
seemed to be put above hers.

Chindamo, who always claimed he was the victim of mistaken identity, walked free from jail last July.

He was recalled to prison on licence 
after he was arrested at his home in Catford, south London, on suspicion
of robbery on November 24 of which he has now been acquitted.
