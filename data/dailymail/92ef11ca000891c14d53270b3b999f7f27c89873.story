It was a momentous occasion earlier this month when nine-year-old Giant Panda Yuan Yuan successfully gave birth to a baby girl cub named Tuan Tuan.

The panda was born at the Taipei Zoo after three years filled with seven failed pregnancies for the mother. Natural pregnancy among pandas is relatively rare.

Now a few weeks older, baby Tuan Tuan is growing fast and has doubled in weight.

The cub is still being cared for behind the scenes at the zoo, and visitors won't get to see the baby until she is three-months old. To update Tuan Tuan's admirers, the zoo released a new set of photos of the growing cub hamming it up for the camera.

 named the animals Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, which together means 
'reunion.' Opposition politicians and other Taiwanese skeptics have 
warned China could use the pandas to advance its unification agenda with
 self-governed Taiwan.

But the pair has remained the most 
adored animals at the zoo. Yuan Yuan's anticipated pregnancy has been
