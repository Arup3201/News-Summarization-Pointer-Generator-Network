Nick Clegg backed Tory plans to strip the under-25s of benefits if they refuse to take a job or training yesterday saying young people should not be allowed to simply ‘cross their arms and sit on the sofa’.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would block any ‘blanket removal’ of handouts based simply on age.

Amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners, Mr Clegg said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s.

Support: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave David Cameron's plans to scale back on benefits for the under 25s his backing on LBC radio yesterday

Mr Clegg also voiced support for proposals by David Cameron to extend ‘conditionality’ to welfare payments.

The Prime Minister used his speech to the Tory conference to say that everyone under 25 should be ‘earning or learning’.

Aides said that would mean taking away JobSeeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit from those who refuse a job, a training place, an apprenticeship or a further education place.

At the moment, JSA can be slashed if the jobless refuse to take work, but the Tories want to extend that to include Housing Benefit too. 

Crackdown: Mr Cameron layed out his plans in his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference this week

Mr Clegg told London radio station LBC: ‘I think everybody agrees that if you can help it, you don’t want youngsters on benefits, you want them either being active or earning or learning.

‘So I’m all for making sure there’s better conditionality so that the incentive to just rely on benefits is minimised.’

Concessions: Mr Clegg said that he would not accept a blanket ban on handouts because of age

He added: ‘Here’s the big thing - and this is already in the rules by the way and I’m a big supporter of this - if you don’t take those opportunities up, don’t expect you can go back home and just sit on benefits.

'You can’t just say: “I’m going to cross my arms, sit on my sofa and not try”, let’s look at that.’

Mr Clegg said he would need to examine the detail of the Conservative proposals and he rejected a previous Tory plan to simply strip Housing Benefit from everyone under the age of 25.

He said: ‘I’m not in favour of just blanket removal of people just because they happen to be a certain age.

‘What if you’re a youngster from Lincoln who’s trying to make his or her way in Manchester and you’re trying really hard and then suddenly you’re having the rug pulled from under your feet.’

Treasury minister Sajid Javid sowed further confusion about what the plans would actually entail when he said the benefits crackdown would apply to ‘all under-25s’.

He said: ‘It will affect all under-25s. This is Conservative policy, something we plan to put into our Conservative manifesto.

‘For under-25s, there’ll be two options, which is earning or learning.

'And that’s not just because it’s the right thing to do for those individuals concerned, but it’s also right for hardworking taxpayers that are paying for these benefits through their taxes.’

Trouble ahead? But amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners, Mr Clegg said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s

A senior Tory source said: ‘We’re not talking about a blanket ban. We’re talking about conditionality if people refuse to take a job or a training place.

'We’ve said there will be exemptions for people emerging from care and for the disabled. We are also examining what to do about single mothers with young children.’

Mr Javid admitted: ‘There’s a lot of detail to work out. This is something we’ll flesh out over the coming months to get it ready for our manifesto.

‘But our intention is clear - that young people, too many of them, thousands each year slide into a life on benefits when they leave compulsory education.

'That’s not acceptable - it’s not good for them, and it’s not good for taxpayers.’
