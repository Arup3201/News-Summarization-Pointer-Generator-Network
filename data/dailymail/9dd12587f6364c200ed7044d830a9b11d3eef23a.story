Victim: Virginia Messick, now 21, was raped by her trainer while she was in the Air Force in 2011

A female Air Force recruit who was raped by her trainer has broken her anonymity to speak out about how she was left with nowhere to turn after the violent attack.

Virginia Messick was 19 when she was raped by Staff Sgt Luis Walker at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. When the attack was over, he told her it was fun and they should do it again.

Afterwards, he demanded she keep quiet or face being kicked out of the Air Force, and knowing he was the one she would report any wrongdoing to, she felt cornered.

'He told us that he was God, that the 
Air Force wasn't going to believe anything we said over him,' she told the New York Times. 
'That we were never going to get anywhere - especially the fact that we 
were women.'

Ms Messick, who is now 21 and has 
left the military, is the first of Walker's 10 victims to publicly talk 
about the man who gained her trust and then attacked her.

Walker,
a married father of two young boys, was found guilty last July of 28 
counts, including rape and sexual assault, and is now serving a 20-year 
prison sentence.

He was the
first Lackland Air Force Base officer to face a court-martial; in total, 
62 trainees were victims of assault or other improper conduct by 32 
instructors at the base between 2009 and 2012.

Walker
singled out Ms Messick, who moved to Texas from a rural Florida town, 
just weeks after her arrival and invited her to his office so she could 
send emails to friends, which is against military code.

Attacker: Staff Sgt. Luis Walker is now serving 20 years in prison for attacking 10 female trainees at the base

During one visit, he groped her and she demanded that he stop, the New York Times reported, and he assured her it would not happen again.

But five
weeks into her training in April 2011, Ms Messick had just finished 
cleaning a dorm for new arrivals and was putting towels in a 
room, unaware that Walker had been hiding behind a door.

'He closed the door behind me and that's 
when he proceeded to rape me,' she said. '[He] told me I was going to do 
what he wanted me to do or I was going to get kicked out of the Air Force.'

She was unable to move or scream, and she was left with overwhelming shock that she had been assaulted by the man the Air Force had entrusted with her life, the Times reported.

Nowhere to turn: Ms Messick said she did not report the attack in fear of losing her job in the Air Force

Threats: Walker had told her that she had no chance getting officials to believe her as she was a woman

'[He said] if
I would have said something about it I
would've been putting my own career in jeopardy,' she said. 'So I 
didn't report it. I didn't say anything. I didn't talk to anybody.'

She
blocked out the attack and continued to train with him for nearly 
another month, aware that the person she was supposed to report the 
attack to was the person who had attacked her.

She also married a friend in the Air Force in a bid for 'some kind of protection' but they divorced months later.

She told only one friend that she had 'sex' with Walker, and months later she was approached by Air Force investigators who hauled her into a room for an interview.

'I was so numb to it I didn't even want to talk about it,' she told the New York Times. 'On top of that, it was two strangers. I don't want to talk to two strangers about that.'

She eventually gave them a lesser version of what had happened, still fearful of losing her job.

Trial: Walker, right, as he arrived for the fourth day of his trial at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio

None of the victims at Lackland told 
officials about the attacks, and they were only revealed when a female 
trainee who had not been assaulted went to senior staff.

Even
though Ms Messick went on to testify in his court-martial that Walker had raped 
her, because she did not say this in earlier interviews, he was only
charged in her case with engaging in an unprofessional relationship involving sodomy and sexual intercourse.

But he was eventually found guilty of 28 counts involving 10 trainees.

Ms Messick said she has decided to speak out now because she thinks it will be therapeutic. She left the military in 2012 with an injury and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder.

A military lawyer arranged for her to 
take a therapy program at a nearby Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital and last December she married again.

Scene: Lackland Air Force Base is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year

But she is still bitter about the military and how they have failed to care for her.

'They haven’t come to me or any of the other 
girls to ask them what to change,' she said. 'They basically have left me to fend 
for myself.'

Of the  Air Force instructors who carried out sexual attacks on women trainees, seven have faced a court-martial, including Staff Sgt. Luis Walker.

Eight more court-martial cases are pending, while 15 other instructors are under investigation, and two senior officers have been relieved of command, the Times reported.

As an increasing number of cases emerge, the military has been accused of failing to resolve a key issue: Women being too afraid to report the attacks because of repercussions for their careers.

Moving on: Ms Messick has now left the Air Force and has married. She still suffers from PTSD

More than 3,000 sexual assault cases in 
the military were reported in 2011, but Leon Panetta said the actual 
figure could be as high as 19,000, with an incidence of one in three 
women.

In the U.S., commanders make the final decision
over whether criminal charges are brought in military courts, which 
varies from other countries where independent military judicial systems 
are in place.

'It's no mystery why they don’t come 
forward,' Laurie Leitch, a psychologist who deals with assault 
cases, told the Times. 'It is like going to your boss to report that you
have been sexually assaulted. How realistic is that?'

Lackland is where all Air Force recruits go through basic training. It has about 475 instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. While one in five recruits are female, most instructors are male.
