Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has remarried in secret to a former BBC weather girl, according to reports in Pakistan.

The 62-year-old is believed to have tied the knot at the weekend with Pakistani news anchor Reham Khan, 41, who is a divorced mother-of-three.

She lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme ‘South Today’.

Rumours have been circulating for several months that the pair are an item, and there have been reports in recent days that they are now married.

Imran Khan’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry.

She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ 

The couple are yet to make an official announcement – which will apparently be forthcoming in the new year - but sources close to them have confirmed they are married.

A family friend said that relatives including his sisters were against the marriage and were surprised he went ahead.

 It is believed family members and those in his political party tried talking him out of the marriage.

Leading political commentator Dr Shahid Masood, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, said on television that Imran neither confirmed nor denied the news.

He added that members of Imran’s political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed that Reham wants to get actively get involved with his politics and sees herself a future first lady.

Dr Masood has urged Imran to issue an official statement.

Reaction to the rumoured marriage has been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media.

Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country.

Rival political parties are jumping on the negative reaction and believe it will harm his credibility to marry a divorcee with an apparently chequered past.

Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor.

 Last of Lord Lucan's fast-living set is dead aged 77

The last person to see Lord Lucan alive has died

Scarcely a week after the Earl of Lucan’s 80th birthday, the last person to see the fugitive peer alive has died.

William Shand Kydd, who was married to Lady Lucan’s sister Christina, passed away peacefully at home two days after Christmas, aged 77.

‘It’s the end of an era,’ says a friend of the family. ‘Bill was an amazing man.’

Wallpaper heir Bill was the last survivor of ‘Lucky’ Lucan’s gambling chums, the tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, zookeeper John Aspinall and Mark Birley, founder of Annabel’s nightclub.

Bill raced power boats with Lucan before turning to horse-racing and becoming a successful amateur jockey, riding 117 winners over jumps and also taking part in the Grand National.

He became a tetraplegic after breaking his neck in a riding accident in 1995 and went on to raise thousands of pounds for spinal research.

However, it was the father of two’s unwitting role in Lucan’s disappearance in 1974 that created all the headlines. On the night that nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death in the Earl’s family home in London’s Belgravia, the peer tried to contact Bill.

Lucan wrote him two letters, outlining details of his bank account and estate, and explaining that he had been involved in the ‘most ghastly circumstances’. In the letters, which Bill read out at the official inquest into Rivett’s death, Lucan begged Bill to look after his heir George, then seven, and his daughters Frances, ten, and Camilla, four, over whom Lucan had fought a bitter custody battle after he split up with his wife, Veronica.

The earl was named by the inquest’s jury as Rivett’s murderer and his children continued to live with Lady Lucan in the years immediately afterwards.

However, in 1982, custody of all three was transferred to Bill and Christina, who lived at Horton Hall in Bedfordshire.

Lady Lucan did not contest this and George and his sisters have not had contact with their mother since.

Bill was related to Princess Diana through his late half-brother, Peter Shand Kydd, who was her stepfather.

‘He will be deeply missed,’ says his friend. Bill had been separated from Christina for seven years before his accident and lived with his lover, interior designer Sally Ramsay Patrick, at Horton Hall.

But Christina showed unswerving loyalty and moved back in after his fall and set about restoring her husband to health.

Sally proved an equally determined nurse and the two women — reputed to have met for the first time when they stood either side of the trolley that took Bill to intensive care — agreed to separate visiting hours.

Branson gets grandchildren for Christmas 

Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has become a grandfather. His daughter Holly has given birth to twins, whom she and her husband, Virgin investment manager Freddie Andrewes, have named Etta and Artie.

‘Despite being delivered early, all three of us are fit and well,’ says Holly, 32. ‘They are absolutely perfect (but who wouldn’t say that about their kids!). What’s more, the little ones also arrived on mine and Freddie’s third wedding anniversary — could there be a better way to mark the occasion?’

Prince George is particularly taken with his police car soft toy

George, caught by the fuzz 

Prince George appears to be taking a keen interest in royal protection, if his Christmas presents are anything to go by. 

The 17-month-old future king is said to be particularly delighted with his gift from his aunt Pippa Middleton — a police car.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister bought the soft toy for £9 from Chelsea Toys in London. 

‘She was looking for a small gift because she’d already bought him a massive thing,’ owner Alka Poole tells me. ‘She just needed something to give him to play with.’

Happily, George was more impressed with Pippa’s gift than the cuddly toy bilby he was given in Australia in April, which he threw away within seconds.

Why Clegg is no. 2 at home, too 

Given that their sons are named Antonio, Alberto and Miguel, there was never much doubt as to who wore the trousers in Nick Clegg’s household. But now the Deputy Prime Minister has admitted that his wife Miriam is a fiery character.

Asked if he or the 46-year-old lawyer is the most even-tempered, Clegg, 47, replies: ‘I think, er, I don’t know if I can say it, but Miriam is truly Spanish.’ The couple met when they were students in Bruges.

‘It was total thunderbolt stuff,’ he says in a joint interview with his wife.

Of their 14-year marriage, Miriam says: ‘I think the secret is laughing a lot and having big arguments. If you can get over it before you go to bed, that’s fine.’

Sir Donald Sinden’s family have expressed their gratitude after one of the theatrical treasures stolen from his house was returned to them.

The people who found the 5ft long sword made by the Royal Shakespeare Company contacted his son Marc Sinden after reading in this column about the burglary of the late actor’s Kent home. 

‘It was tossed into a ditch on Romney Marsh,’ Marc tells me. ‘A big thank you to the Daily Mail for making the people who found it aware of quite what it meant to us.’

Director Tim Burton’s split from Helena Bonham Carter after 13 years together does not seem to be helping his career. 

His latest film Big Eyes, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, has flopped at the British box office. 

Big Eyes recouped only £135,682 from 155 screens over the weekend to limp into the charts in 13th place. 

In Burton’s native America, it took a relatively small £2.95 million in its first four days. 

It’s poetic justice for Helena, whom Burton failed to cast in Big Eyes, even though she had starred in six of his previous films. 

Despite confirmation of Joan Collins’s damehood, which I disclosed more than three weeks ago, the 81-year-old actress is not letting the grass grow under her feet.

The former Dynasty star has parted company with her agent of more than 20 years, Peter Charlesworth, and signed up with Jonathan Shalit’s ROAR Global.

Given that Shalit’s clients include The X Factor judges Mel B and Tulisa Contostavlos, how long before Joanie appears on a show such as Britain’s Got Talent?
