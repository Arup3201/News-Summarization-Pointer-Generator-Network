People are being urged to dump a brand of frozen berries that have been linked to Hepatitis A infections in Victoria and NSW.

Victoria's health department has urged consumers to dispose of 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores.

Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after consuming the imported fruit.

The product contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile

The health department has also told the company to recall the product, which is distributed by Patties in Victoria, but packed in China.

It contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile.

Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past.

'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday.

'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.'

Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes.

The outbreak comes as a number of Victorian hospitals are told to dispose of chocolate mousse, which has been found to contain listeria.

Hospitals are contacting patients who might have consumed the dessert between January 29 and February 10.

No cases of the illness have been reported and the product is not supplied to the general public.

The contamination came to light after the company conducted routine testing of its products.

Listeria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, their unborn babies and the elderly.
