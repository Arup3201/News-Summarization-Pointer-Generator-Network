Speaking out: Anna Soubry said midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic

Midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic, a health minister has said.

Anna Soubry said it was ‘absolutely bonkers’ that the NHS had stopped the practice.

The mother-of-two said women need not feel such weigh-ins were intrusive – and said that she was happy to be weighed when she was pregnant because it helped her ‘keep an eye on things’.

Midwives could then use the information to give women advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise.

The Health Service is having to deal with more and more overweight women having children – putting them at increased risk of pregnancy complications.

There is also a concern fat mothers can pass their obesity on to their children.

A third of children are now overweight or obese. Yet despite the risks of harm to mother and baby, the NHS stopped routinely weighing pregnant women around the turn of the millennium for fear of stigmatising the obese.

Miss Soubry, the public health minister, revealed she was looking at the issue of weighing mothers-to-be during a debate on childhood obesity in Westminster Hall.

She also said she wanted updated advice for new mothers to ensure they are better at feeding their babies rather than putting them at unnecessary risk of obesity.

Obesity puts mothers at risk of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, which can make pregnancies more dangerous.

There is a higher risk of early induction and Caesarean sections, and a greater threat of pre-eclampsia, which can lead to life-threatening seizures.

Maternal obesity also makes babies more likely to be obese in later life, and it can lead to a range of birth defects such as spina bifida.

Way forward: It is claimed that midwives could use the information from weighing women to give them advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise. This picture is posed by a model

The minister’s call was welcomed by Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum. He said: ‘Weighing stopped around the beginning of the last Labour administration when it was considered the practice was unduly concerning women about their size.

‘Measuring them frequently was considered to be non-PC, but what they did was throw the baby out with the bathwater.

It has fuelled the consequences of obesity, with effects for mothers, babies and huge expense to the NHS.’

The Royal College of Midwives however said there was no reason to weigh all women, and that it was usual practice to weigh those who are clearly obese. 

Janet Fyle, a midwife adviser to the college, said: ‘We stopped weighing women because it didn’t make much difference in terms of assessing the state of the pregnancy and foetal wellbeing.

‘You can visibly see if a woman is getting obese, and there are protocols in place so that sometimes we may need to weigh them.’ She added that it was more important to help mothers feed their child healthily.
