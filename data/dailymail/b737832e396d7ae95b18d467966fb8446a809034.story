Ed Miliband is preparing to announce an extra £1.7billion will be spent on the NHS, funded by a mansion tax on wealthy homeowners.

The Labour leader is expected to use his speech to his party conference in Manchester to promise to ‘protect the NHS’.

He will announce plans to make it easier to get a GP appointment, improving hospital services and repeal the Health and Social Care Bill to take lawyers out of ‘our hospitals’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to use his conference speech to promise to divert billions of pounds into the NHS

Details of exactly what the extra money will be spent on have not yet been announced.

But at the weekend Mr Miliband said he wanted to ‘put the right values back at the heart of our NHS’.

He revealed he was ‘deeply worried’ about what would happen to NHS funding in the next parliament, and vowed to ‘protect’ it.

Labour’s proposed Mansion Tax would be imposed on properties worth more than £2million.

The money raised used to be earmarked for the cost of reintroducing the 10p tax rate to help low earners.

But today shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced the 10p rate could be paid for by abolishing the married tax allowance.

He said in his conference speech: ‘How can it be right that the billionaire overseas buyer this year of a £140 million penthouse in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in property tax, the same as the average value property in that area?’

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warned the NHS is a 'service on the brink', while shadow chancellor Ed Balls insisted the Mansion Tax was needed to ensure billionaire homeowners pay their fair share

Labour is determined to fight the next election on the NHS, claiming it is not safe in Tory hands.

Mr Miliband said on Sunday: ‘We’re going to put the right values back at the heart of our NHS.

‘The second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to actually do something about GP access.

‘And I’ll tell you why: because a hospital is only as strong as the services in the community, and at the moment those services are creaking.

‘You know one in four people doesn’t get to see their GP for more than a week. We’re going to actually ensure that people can see their GP within 48 hours.’

He added: ‘I am deeply worried about the NHS in the next Parliament... We did promise to protect the NHS and absolutely we want to protect the NHS.

‘We certainly are going to make sure that the NHS doesn’t lose money and we want to do more than that and obviously we’ll be saying more about that between now and the election.’

Shadow health Andy Burnham last night said he would put ‘a new vision for the National Health Service at the heart of the Labour Party manifesto'. 

He said the NHS was a ‘service on the brink’. Speaking at a fringe event in Manchester, Mr Burnham added: ‘We will work hard to give you peace of mind that your mum, your dad is properly looked after when you’re not there.

‘We should end the scandal of 15 minute visits. We should end the scandal of zero-hours contracts in social care.

‘We are going to build a health service that gives dignity and peace of mind to every older person.

‘We are going to build a health service that lifts social care up off the floor. We’re going to bring social care into the NHS and we’re going to build a 21st century service based on that Labour principle of people before profits.'
