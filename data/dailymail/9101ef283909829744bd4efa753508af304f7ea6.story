Leonard Lauder, chairman of the cosmetics giant Estee Lauder, is set to tie the knot this January.

The 81-year-old billionaire will marry longtime friend Judith Glickman, 76, in Sarasota, Florida, according to the New York Post.

Mr Lauder had planned to walk down the aisle with Brooklyn Public Library president and CEO Linda E. Johnson, 55, in August 2013, but canceled the wedding just weeks in advance and announced that the couple had called it quits in December.

He and Ms Glickman, a photographer and artist, began dating earlier this year, after having been friends for 35 years.

The octogenarian announced the engagement to friends in July, reportedly adding ‘We’re not engaged - we’re getting married’ to clarify that he was determined to follow through with the nuptials.

Ms Glickman is the widow of Al Glickman, a real estate developer and philanthropist who died in April 2013.

Both are grandparents. Mr Lauder has two sons, William and Gary, and five grandchildren.

Ms Glickman has four children and 18 grandchildren. One of her sons is a rabbi in Sarasota, where the wedding is to take place.

Mr Lauder and Ms Johnson told friends of their split in an email calling off their holiday party last year.

'Sadly, we have made the difficult but mutual decision to go our separate ways. We will remain friends and certainly cherish the time we spent together. We are so very sorry for the inconvenience and send you our warmest wishes,' it read.

Married for 52 years: Mr Lauder tragically lost his first wife Evelyn (right) to ovarian cancer in 2011

He began dating Ms Johnson in 2012, a year after he tragically lost his first wife, Evelyn, to ovarian cancer. They had been married for 52 years and had helped grow the family business together.

Leonard and Evelyn Lauder married in 1959 and had two sons together. She had also worked at the cosmetics giant and was especially famous for spearheading the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative.

Mr Lauder is the first son of Estee Lauder, who co-founded the eponymous beauty company with her husband, Joseph, in 1946.

His estimated net worth is currently $8.2 billion, according to Forbes.
