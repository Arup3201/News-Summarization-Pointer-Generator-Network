Guilty: Michelle Hodson, 23, was jailed for seven years for grievous bodily harm

A woman broke a toddler's collarbone and left her with bleeding on the brain after violently pushing her over when she started fighting with another child.

Michelle Hodson, 23, claimed to have had a 'momentary loss of temper' when she attacked the little girl near Preston in Lancashire between May 8 and July 13, 2012.

Last Friday Hodson sobbed uncontrollably as she was 
led away from the dock to begin a seven year sentence after pleading 
guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

It was not clear who called for the ambulance after the attack, but when paramedics arrived, they found Hodson playing on her phone.

Meanwhile the badly-injured toddler lay on the floor suffering a fit with her eyes half open.

The child was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital where she was treated for her injuries, which included bleeding on the brain.

Preston Crown Court heard doctors feared the child would not survive the journey to Pendlebury Children’s 
Hospital’s neurological centre.

But
 surgeons performed emergency surgery at the little girl was transferred
 to the children’s hospital, where she spent 11 days receiving life-saving treatment.

The toddler has since made a full 
recovery and consultant paediatrician Dr Peter Urquart claimed it was 
'astonishing' the child was well again.

The court heard Hodson, of no fixed 
abode, gave different accounts to police and medical staff of what 
happened to the little girl.

She initially claimed her victim had fallen and even said another child had pushed her to cause the horrific injuries.

After Hodson was jailed for seven years in prison for grievous bodily harm relating to the incident, Mark Stephenson, defending, said: 'She will never forget what she has done'.

She has caused injury to a very young child...She accepts she has done wrong,' he added.

Mr Stephenson went on to day that his client was 'clearly not in the best frame of mind' at the time of the attack and had a 'momentary loss of temper'.

Judge Pamela Badley praised staff from the Royal Preston Hospital for the work saving the little girl’s life.

Judge Badley added: 'It is a very great credit to the care she received that she made such a good recovery.'
