An Old West gun battle re-enactor in South Dakota who wounded three onlookers when he fired live rounds instead of blanks has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.

Paul Doering was taken into custody immediately upon sentencing at federal court in Rapid City on Monday. 

Doering, 49, a six-time convicted felon, told the court he ‘panicked’ and has ‘gone over this a million and a-half times, trying to figure out how I let this happen.’

He had faced up to 20 years in prison.

The re-enactor pleaded guilty in January to a charge of tampering in a plea deal with prosecutors.

Under the deal, prosecutors dropped the original charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Doering admits in court documents that he tried to hide two guns and ammunition after the June 17 shooting in Hill City.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman told the court: ‘None of this would have happened if the defendant would have complied with the law,’ the Rapid City Journal reported.

The three tourists were hit during the June 17 re-enactment staged by the Dakota Wild Bunch, who usually use blanks when performing several times a week on a street in Hill City, a tourist town in South Dakota's Black Hills.

The show has now been suspended.

The bullets shattered a leg bone of Carrol Knutson, 65, of Birchwood, Minnesota; hit the forearm and elbow of John Ellis, 48, an optometrist from South Connellsville, Pennsylvania; and caused minor injuries to Jose Pruneda, 53, of Alliance, Nebraska.

Criminal record: Doering is a six-time convicted felon

Horror: Blood from one of the victims pools in the street where the shootout happened

Scene: The event took place on the corner of Main St and Elm St, in Hill City, South Dakota

Investigators will not say why the incident happened, but Hill City Administrator Brett McMacken said it appeared to have been accidental.

The mock shootouts between lawmen and outlaws, sponsored by the Hill City Chamber of Commerce, have been held in the town in front of crowds of around 160 people for at least 20 years.

The Dakota Wild Bunch has been doing the show, which has since been suspended, for four years.

Investigators found Doering had served more than five years in Minnesota prisons on multiple felony convictions.

Aftermath: Pennington County deputies question a member of the shootout

But South Dakota law prohibits convicted criminals from possessing or having control of a firearm for 15 years.

He served 14 months for two first-degree assault convictions in the early 1980s, according to John Schadl of the Minnesota Department of Corrections.

He returned to prison in 1990 after he was convicted of second-degree burglary. While serving a 14-month sentence, he was charged with escape and ordered to serve additional time.

Doering then went back to prison in 2000 and late 2001 after he was convicted of fleeing from law enforcement.

His lengthy criminal history includes numerous arrests for traffic violations and at least one conviction for driving with more than the legal limit of alcohol in his system.

Court records also show that Doering pleaded guilty to violating a protection order in 2004.

He was placed on probation and was only released from probation in April 2010.

Authorities said they did not know whether background checks were carried out on the re-enactors.

George Heywood Jr, of Hill City, was once a part of the shootout re-enactments, and said many residents were not fans.

He said: 'Certain people in Hill City have never cared for it. At one time, it was really neat.'

Heywood said local support for the shootout has declined as new people joined the business district, and there was much more control over the shootout when local businessmen were actively involved in the performances.

He added: 'I think they had a lot more into it, so safety meant more than when you have someone hired or brought in that no one really knows.'

When asked about Doering's criminal record, he said: 'I think that’s a big mistake by somebody. Whoever’s in charge of that group, that’s definitely a big mistake.'
