Nadine Dorries claimed to have gone straight back to her day job as a politician yesterday – while holed up in a luxury hotel in Australia.

But her bewildered constituency association said the MP, who has been suspended by the Conservative Party after abandoning her post to appear on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, has still not been in contact.

Miss Dorries insisted she had started work within hours of being the first contestant evicted from the Australian jungle, as seen by viewers of the ITV reality show on Wednesday night.

Post Jungle: Nadine Dorries used an interview on Daybreak to criticise the Tory leadership who she claimed feared what she would say

Out! Nadine Dorries has been evicted from the I'm A Celebrity jungle but said that she had been given permission by the Tories to have a month off work

She said she was working from the 
five-star Palazzo Versace resort on the Australian Gold Coast, where a 
superior room costs £285 a night, and where she is due to stay until the
series ends early next month.

The Mid-Bedfordshire MP, who has been 
paid up to £40,000 to appear on the show, said: ‘There’s been an office 
set up in my hotel room and I’ve already been back at work actually.

'As 
soon as I got out of the jungle I was straight back to work.’

But Budge Wells, deputy chairman of 
the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association, last night said he has 
still to hear from his MP, adding: ‘She has not been in contact with me 
or anyone else in the association.

‘As I understand it she has set up an 
office in her hotel and says she has gone straight back to work but we 
have not heard from her.’

The association was furious when Miss 
Dorries, 55, left for Australia without telling them and is considering 
deselecting her for the next General Election.

There have been more than 100 complaints from constituents about her absence.

Mr Wells added: ‘I’m looking forward 
to having her back in the constituency; we would like to discuss with 
her the whole matter of what has gone on since she went away.

'Obviously 
what she has done has raised a few questions but we will just have to 
wait and see what she says before deciding on what action to take.’

Eviction: The MP survived 12 days in the jungle as a contestant on I'm A Celebrity

Miss Dorries was greeted by her 
partner, vet Chris Hammond, after surviving 12 days on the show and 
tackling some of its infamous Bushtucker Trials, which included eating 
an ostrich anus to win meals for her campmates.

One of her first moves was to attack 
former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, who she claimed had given her 
permission to be away from Westminster for a month.

She said: ‘A lot of MPs can take 
between four and six weeks a year and he said that was fine and that I 
could take the month away.

'I didn’t tell him what it was for, because I 
couldn’t, as I was bound to confidentiality.

'But I did tell him what I 
was going to do would be quite controversial.’

Miss Dorries said her 
office had been manned and her staff had been working for her 
constituents while she was away.

'However well-intentioned, Nadine's publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for'

 Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft

She has also pledged to give her MP’s 
salary for the time she is in Australia to local charities, although she
has made no such comment regarding her much larger fee from I’m A 
Celebrity.

A poll in her constituency revealed almost 60 per cent of Conservatives ‘disapprove’ of her decision to abandon Parliament.

Asked to rate how they feel about Miss
Dorries, ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘extremely negative’, she 
scored just 2.82, while 58 per cent said David Cameron was right to 
suspend her.

Just 8 per cent said they are now more likely to vote for 
her.

Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who commissioned the survey, said:
‘Nadine said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge 
audience about important questions, at a time when nobody pays attention
to politicians.

Unfortunately, her constituents are not buying this.

‘There is a long way to go to the next
election and voters can be forgiving. But however well-intentioned, 
Nadine’s publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for.’

Labour MP Steve McCabe mocked Miss 
Dorries’s claim to be working, saying: ‘I’m sure her constituents will 
be greatly relieved to hear that she is going to do part of her job from
her five-star hotel.’

He went on: ‘If she was swallowed by a python and
never came back to Westminster I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it,’
the Kent Messenger reported.

‘If she wanted to connect with people
she should have talked to people face-to-face. I don't have to go to 
Australia to do that.’

Bugged out: She was subjected to Bush Tucker trials, including being buried in a coffin with bugs

Speaking to I'm a Celeb hosts Ant and Dec announced the outcome of the vote at the campsite.

She said: 'I'm not disappointed at being the first, especially when you're starving. I kind of expected it.

'It's been a fascinating experience. I actually came here self-important for a few days,  but I'm not now.'

Speaking about Helen Flanagan, who she praised as 'very intelligent', Nadine has revealed she gave her a motivational talk prior to her Bushtucker victory, and seemed to take credit for Helen's trial triumph.

She also predicted that David Haye would be the overall winner.
