Manchester United do not know when Argentine defender Marcos Rojo will be available again after he missed the 3-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday, admitted manager Louis van Gaal.

Van Gaal told reporters the 24-year-old, signed from Sporting Lisbon in the summer, was injured in training on Saturday, which meant Phil Jones was brought in despite only just being back from injury.

The manager declined to go into detail, saying only: 'I don't think it's healthy but I'm not a doctor.'

United were already without injured defenders Rafael, Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw, which meant fielding a three-man backline of Jones, Jonny Evans and midfielder Michael Carrick.

Meanwhile Liverpool's Australian goalkeeper Brad Jones, brought in for a first league appearance since March 2013, will stay in the side in place of the out-of-form Simon Mignolet.

Manager Brendan Rodgers told reporters the change was for 'an indefinite period', adding that Jones will play in the Capital One Cup quarter-final away to Bournemouth on Wednesday.
