It is a war-torn country that has barely been out of the headlines for decades, but it seems Afghanistan is also experience a resurgence as an alternative tourist destinations.

Despite the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advising against all travel or all but essential travel to the entire country, some adventure tour operators are offering trips to curious travellers.

Specialist operator Wild Frontiers has seen bookings for group tours to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraqi Kurdistan double in the past year despite ongoing political turmoil in the troubled nations.

Most tours begin in the capital Kabul, which is still scarred by war but experience a resurgence, with busy bazaars and new buildings being constructed at record rates

And adventure travel company Hinterland Travel reported 2014 as its busiest year yet for bookings to Afghanistan, according to the Guardian.

The extreme trips are available to travellers with deep pockets, costing around £4,950 each for two weeks, excluding flights.

Responsible Travel offers tours taking in the historic city and capital Kabul, Buddhist sites, mountain villages, lakes and ancient forts.

Its website explains: 'Our Afghan Explorer tour takes you through the mountains and plains, following in the footsteps of Marco Polo. 

From Kabul and the foothills of the Hindu Kush, you will visit the extraordinary city of Herat, the famous mountain caves of Bamiyan, the breathtaking lakes at Band-e Amir, the historical northern towns of Mazar-e Sharif and Balkh as well as the famous Panjshir Valley.'

The company adds: 'Afghanistan is undergoing tremendous change at the moment but for the vast majority of Afghans, daily life continues in much the same vein as it has for centuries and there will be ample opportunities to witness traditional lifestyles from farming and pottery-making to silk-weaving and daily prayer.'

However, as a warning to travellers, Responsible Travel explains: 'It may sound obvious but anyone wishing to travel to Afghanistan must understand that in places tourist infrastructure is almost non-existent. 

Days can be long and hard, and the levels of services will not match those offered in more regular tourist locations. However, don’t let this put you off. In our opinion Afghanistan is simply the most fascinating country in the world.'

The FCO advises against all travel to most regions in Afghanistan and all but essential travel to the country's heartland and the border with Iran.

It warns: 'There is a high threat from terrorism and specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country.

'2014 has seen an increase in the number of attacks in Kabul. While the majority of the attacks have been against Afghan National Security Forces and ISAF, insurgents have stepped up their attacks against western civilian targets.'

However, Jonny Bealby, founder of Wild Frontiers, told the Guardian: 'Our clients want to get behind the headlines and see for themselves. They are interested, well-read people who realise the media tends to focus on the bad.'

Mr Bealby said that he believes FCO advice can be 'ambiguous, overcautious and outdated' with its advice in some instances and said he often seeks local advice from contacts on the situation in certain areas when planning trips.

Afghan Logistics Tours also offers trips to the troubled country, promising: 'Our custom made tours lend themselves to such travelers who have only limited time to spare or just want to get a taste of Afghanistan en-route from other countries.'
