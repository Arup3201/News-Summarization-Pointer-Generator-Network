More than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure that has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months.

The number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years – making up the equivalent of a city the size of Wolverhampton.

The figures, which are published today by Oxford University’s respected Migration Observatory, are based on analysis of the official Labour Force Survey.

The data also shows that around one in five working-age migrants from Romania and Bulgaria are not in work – a total of 46,000. Arrivals from both countries have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in January.

Tory MP Peter Bone, whose Wellingborough constituency is in Northamptonshire, said the figures disproved the claims of those who said numbers would not increase sharply when the controls were abandoned. ‘It’s quite clear that people were wrong,’ he said. ‘The number one issue in my constituency is controlling immigration from the EU.

‘We have to get to grips with it. We have to act now and if that causes a row with the EU then so be it.’

He called for an emergency brake on EU numbers adding: ‘It’s putting pressure on the doctors’ surgeries, the schools, the council services and housing.’

The Migration Observatory’s analysis said migrant numbers from both countries had ‘grown steadily’ since the countries joined the EU in 2007.

The numbers align almost exactly with predictions from the MigrationWatch think-tank which suggested net migration from both countries would average around 50,000 a year. 

The figures show that in 2006, in the year before Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, the population of nationals from both countries living here stood at just 43,000. It barely changed the following year before steadily increasing, to 98,000 in 2009, 132,000 in 2010 and 160,000 in 2012.

The Left had dismissed the idea that relaxing rules on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria would lead to a surge in numbers in Britain.

Most notably, Lib Dem Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said the idea of thousands ‘pouring off the planes... was just a scare story’. The BBC also downplayed the situation.

In May, when it reported there were fewer workers from the two countries in the UK in March than in January, political editor Nick Robinson scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants.’

In September of 2013, the year before transitional controls were dropped, it stood at 205,000 but by the same point in 2014 it hit 252,000. This means the population from the two countries increased by 47,000 in the 12 months to September and is five times higher than it was eight years ago.

The Migration Observatory said the not-in-work total of 46,000 will include a large number of students, spouses, dependants and those wealthy enough not to work.

Madeleine Sumption, the observatory’s director, said: ‘Immigration from Romania and Bulgaria has been much more gradual than flows from the EU member states that joined in 2004.

‘In 2004, the UK was one of only three EU member states that did not introduce transitional labour market controls on migrants from new accession states, and saw a sharp increase in migration from these countries.

‘It seems likely that the controls imposed in 2007, together with the weak economy at the end of the decade, may have slowed the pace of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants settling in the UK.’
