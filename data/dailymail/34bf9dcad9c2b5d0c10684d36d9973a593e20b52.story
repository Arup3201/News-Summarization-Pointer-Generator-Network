Russia came close to nuclear disaster when a blaze engulfed a sub carrying atomic weapons - despite official assurances that it was not armed, it was reported today.

Russian officials said at the time that all nuclear weapons aboard the Yekaterinburg nuclear submarine had been unloaded well before a fire engulfed the 550ft-long vessel and there had been no risk of a radiation leak.

But the respected Vlast weekly magazine quoted several sources in the Russian navy as saying that throughout the fire on December 29 the submarine was carrying 16 R-29 intercontinental ballistic missiles, each armed with four nuclear warheads.

Massive blaze: The fire aboard the Russian nuclear submarine was eventually extinguished

Smouldering: It remains unclear whether the crew members were trapped by the flames or ordered to remain behind in the sub

'Russia, for a day, was on the brink 
of the biggest catastrophe since the time of Chernobyl,' Vlast reported.
 The 1986 disaster in modern-day Ukraine is regarded as the world's 
worst nuclear accident.

Neither the Russian Defence Ministry 
nor the office of Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who has 
responsibility for military matters, would immediately comment on the 
report. A spokesman for the navy could not be contacted.

A Defence Ministry spokesman insisted there was never any danger of the fire spreading inside

President Dmitry Medvedev gave assurances that there was no radiation leak and that the vessel's nuclear-tipped missiles were not on board

The huge fire which engulfed the 
Yekaterinburg nuclear submarine is the latest catastrophe to afflict 
Russian submarines in recent years.

In November 2008 20 Russians choked to death on poisonous gas on board the Nerpa nuclear submarine.

The
 men suffocated when faulty firefighting equipment went off by mistake 
while the new craft was carrying out underwater tests in the Sea of 
Japan.

In August 2003, two member of a 10-man crew on a Russian K-159 sub died when the vessel sank in the Barents Sea.

The
 submarine's nuclear reactor was shut down at the time the vessel sank 
about three nautical miles north west of Kildin Island.

But by far the worst Russian sub disaster in recent memory happened on the Kursk (pictured above) in August 2000.

An explosion during exercises sent the nuclear sub to the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men on board.

Russia refused offers of help from Britain and the United States and a Russian rescue attempt failed

The fire started when welding sparks 
ignited wooden scaffolding around the 18,200-tonne submarine at the 
Roslyakovo docks, 900 miles north of Moscow and one of the main 
shipyards used by Russia's northern fleet.                

The rubber covering of the submarine 
then caught fire, sending flames and black smoke 30ft above the stricken
 vessel.

Firemen battled the blaze for a day and a night before 
partially sinking the submarine to douse the flames, according to media 
reports.     

Vlast reported that immediately after 
the fire the Yekaterinburg sailed to the navy's weapons store, an 
unusual trip for a damaged submarine supposedly carrying no weapons and 
casting doubt on assurances that it was not armed.     

'K-84 was in dock with rockets and 
torpedoes on board,' the magazine said, adding that apart from the 
nuclear weapons the submarine was carrying torpedoes and mines as well 
as its two nuclear reactors.                

The magazine said that if one of the 
torpedoes had exploded it could have threatened the nuclear missiles, 
leading to an extremely dangerous nuclear accident.  

Media reports of what happened at the 
time of the fire were contradictory and foreign journalists were unable 
to gain access to the high security zone.        

Russia's worst post-Soviet submarine 
disaster was in August 2000 when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the
 Barents Sea killing all 118 crewmen aboard.
