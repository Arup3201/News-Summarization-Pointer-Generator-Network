Feline owners should 'cat-ify' their homes with the same child-proofing techniques used by parents, according to feline behaviorist Jackson Galaxy.

Mr Galaxy, the host of Animal Planet's My Cat from Hell, appeared on the Today show, where he advised Lindsay Custozzo, a Pittsburgh woman with a feisty feline, to store small objects in a kitty-proof cabinet.

'You have kids, you childproof. Whether it's change, earrings, hair ties - they go in something, and that something has a child lock on it,' he said.

Ms Custozzo was also frustrated with her cat Lucy, a two-year-old Siberian mix, for leaving paw prints on her kitchen table.

Mr Galaxy told her to 'stop providing temptation' by leaving clutter on the table top. 

'If there's nothing for them to get up there and get, they'll stop getting up there,' he said.

Blinds ambition: He also recommends giving cats an outside view when owners leave the house

When Ms Custozzo complained that Lucy was climbing on her window blinds, Mr Galaxy said that it's important for owners to raise the blinds when leaving the house so that curious cats won't be drawn to them.

'We have to allow her to see what you are doing,' he said.

And for those fed-up felines who act standoffish, Mr Galaxy had a simple solution: more playtime with toys.

'She's just in that world of being a teenager,' he said. 'All we have to do is direct all those behaviors in a positive place.'

My Cat from Hell, which premiered in 2011, sees Mr Galaxy providing guidance to the owners of cats with behavioral problems.

He also runs a private consulting practice in Los Angeles.
