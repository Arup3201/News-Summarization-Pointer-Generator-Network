Dominique Strauss-Kahn was today embroiled in a fresh sex scandal, as claims emerged that he tried to assault an Italian television journalist in the late 1990s.

Myrta Merlino was forced to fight off the former IMF chief in a hotel room in Davos, it is alleged.

The allegations come just as the shamed economist begins to rehabilitate his damaged image.

Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to assault Italian journalist Myrta Merlino during an interview in the late 1990s

Strauss-Kahn, 64, has been hit by a catalogue of sex scandals since 2011 when he was accused of attempting to rape a hotel chambermaid in New York City.

The charge was later dropped.

According to the latest allegations, Miss Merlino, then a business correspondent, secured an interview with the then-French finance minister after he ‘noticed her’ during the World Economic Conference in the Swiss mountain resort.

She said: ‘Strauss-Kahn’s press office explained to me that the minister had very important commitments with CNN, but he had noticed me and said he wanted to do the interview in spite of a difficult day.’

The French politician gave her an appointment at 8pm in the bar of his Davos hotel.

But when she arrived, a message arrived on a silver plate telling her the minister was awaiting her in his suite.

In an interview for a digital TV channel, Miss Merlino, 43, told political journalist Klaus Davi: ‘He told me to leave the cameraman outside while we discussed the interview.

'I went in a bit hesitantly and sat down in an armchair. He gave me a large glass of champagne and began taking about everything but the interview.

She continued: ‘Then he shamelessly began an attempt to seduce me.

'He told me that he loved journalists. I told him that I thought his wife an amazing woman and a great journalist.

‘I got up and he pushed me violently against a wall and tried to kiss me. I gave him a powerful slap, I struggled and with difficulty got away.’

The young business reporter immediately fled the room but said she afterwards felt ‘very upset’ by the incident.

She added: ‘It was not the physical 
attack but the psychological violence of a man of power, because when an
important man of a certain age puts pressure as it was in my case at 
the time, a young girl, it is a wrong thing and unpleasant.’

Miss Merlino did not report the incident because she had got away and did not want to become famous because of it, she said.

Mr Strauss-Kahn, once tipped to be the next president of France, made a spectacular fall from grace in 2011 when he was arrested in New York accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo.

Criminal charges were dropped after 18 months with the two parties agreeing an out of court settlement.

Returning to France last year Mr Strauss Kahn faced new accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

Again the case was dropped because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago.

He remains under formal investigation in France in a separate case in which sex workers were allegedly procured for orgies he attended around the world.

Since his 20-year marriage to French journalist Anne Sinclair came to an end last year, Mr Strauss Kahn has been regularly seen with Moroccan-born TV press officer Myriam Aouffir, who is 20 years his junior.
