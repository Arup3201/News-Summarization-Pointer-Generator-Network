The man accused of shooting dead three Muslim students had previously come to their door brandishing a rifle, according to the best friend of one of the victims.

Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder for killing Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, at their apartment near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon.

Police said that Hicks, a self-proclaimed 'anti-theist', carried out the killings after a long-standing parking dispute but the victims' families believe it was a hate crime.

Speaking to Fusion, Yusor Mohammad's best friend, Amira Ata, also dismissed the idea it was over parking - 'there's plenty of space' - and  said she believes they were targeted for being 'different'.

When she learned that her friends had been killed, she said she was not surprised that Hicks was accused of being the one behind it.

'I know that he's an aggressive man,' she said. 'That's not the first we've heard from him.'

She recounted an evening of dinner and board games at the couple's home at the end of last year, and after she left, Yusor heard a knock at the door, she said. It was Hicks.

He complained about the noise - even though it was still early - and about the parking - even though the guests had used visitor parking, Ata said.

'While he was at the door talking to Yusor, he was holding a rifle, she told me later,' Ata said. 'He didn't point it at anyone, but he still had it.

'We thought that was so weird - our neighbors don't come to the door with guns! So when I heard the news [of their deaths] it was shocking, but it wasn't a surprise that it was the neighbor.'

Ata, who grew up with Yusor and spoke to her every day, said she could not imagine her friend saying anything to enrage Hicks before he shot them.

Victims: From left, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all found with bullet wounds to their heads inside the Chapel Hill apartment on Tuesday

'I know Yusor didn't do anything to him – there's no way she could have said even one thing wrong to him because she doesn't get mad,' Ata said. 'Her husband is even nicer, her sister is even nicer – none of them would have said anything to make someone that angry.'

She added: 'I wonder if he just thought Deah was some white guy before his wife moved in...

'Deep down everyone in this community knows it was a hate crime. But how do you prove it?'

Police were still trying to determine whether religious hatred played any role in the shootings.

On Wednesday neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he was obsessed with the shooting-rampage movie 'Falling Down,' and showed 'no compassion at all' for other people.

His current wife, Karen Hicks, said at a tearful press conference that her husband of seven years 'champions the rights of others' and said the killings 'had nothing do with religion or the victims' faith'. 

She then issued another brief statement through her lawyer, saying she's divorcing him.

Officers were summoned by a neighbor who called 911 on Tuesday evening to report hearing multiple gunshots and people screaming - before more gunshots and then silence. 

Vigil: On Wednesday night, hundreds gathered at UNC-Chapel Hill to mourn for the three victims

The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, said police told him each was shot in the head inside the couple's apartment and that he, for one, is convinced it was a hate crime.

'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, who is a psychiatrist.

The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes.

A Muslim advocacy organization pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter.

'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email.

Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation.

Rand said the crime 'appears at this point to have been an isolated incident'.

About 2,000 people attended a candlelight vigil for the victims in the heart of UNC's campus on Wednesday evening. Several people who knew them spoke about their selflessness as friends recounted kindnesses they had extended to others through the years. 

Speaking out: Craig Hicks' wife Karen Hicks, center flanked by her attorneys, said she did not believe the shooting was a hate crime. She later announced that she was divorcing her husband

But at their own press conference, Barakat's family called on the police to investigate it as a hate crime

Barakat and Mohammad were newlyweds who helped the homeless and raised money to help Syrian refugees in Turkey.

They met while helping to run the Muslim Student Association at N.C. State before he began pursuing an advanced degree in dentistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

Mohammad, who graduated in December, planned to join her husband in dentistry school in the fall.

Arrested: Neighbors said that Craig Hicks 'was always angry' and some saw him carrying a gun

Abu-Salha was visiting them from Raleigh, where she was majoring in design at N.C. State.

'This was like the power couple of our community,' said Ali Sajjad, 21, the association's current president. 

Hicks had less success: Unemployed and driving a 15-year-old car, his wife said he had been studying to become a paralegal.

A Second Amendment rights advocate with a concealed weapons permit, Hicks often complained about both Christians and Muslims on his Facebook page.

'Some call me a gun toting Liberal, others call me an open-minded Conservative,' Hicks wrote.

Imad Ahmad, who lived in the condo where his friends were killed until Barakat and Mohammed were married in December, said Hicks complained about once a month that the two men were parking in a visitor's space as well as their assigned spot.

'He would come over to the door, knock on the door and then have a gun on his hip saying, "You guys need to not park here",' said Ahmad, a graduate student in chemistry at UNC-Chapel Hill. 'He did it again after they got married.'

Both Hicks and his neighbors complained to the property managers, who apparently didn't intervene. 'They told us to call the police if the guy came and harassed us again,' Ahmad said.

'This man was frustrated day in and day out about not being able to park where he wanted to,' said Karen Hicks' attorney, Robert Maitland.

The killings were 'related to long-standing parking disputes my husband had with various neighbors regardless of their race, religion or creed,' Karen Hicks said.

Police have not said how Hicks got inside the condominium, but on Wednesday afternoon there were no visible signs of damage to the couple's door, which was affixed with orange stickers warning of biohazardous material inside.

A wooden placard bearing Arabic script that translates to 'Thanks to God' hung over their doorbell.

A woman who lives near the scene described Hicks as short-tempered.

'Anytime that I saw him or saw interaction with him or friends or anyone in the parking lot or myself, he was angry,' Samantha Maness said of Hicks. 'He was very angry, anytime I saw him.'

Hicks' ex-wife, Cynthia Hurley, said that before they divorced about 17 years ago, his favorite movie was 'Falling Down,' the 1993 Michael Douglas film about a divorced unemployed engineer who goes on a shooting rampage.

'That always freaked me out,' Hurley said. 'He watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious. He had no compassion at all,' she said.

In a brief court appearance Wednesday, Hicks, who lived in the same apartment building as the victims, appointed a public defender after saying he could not afford a lawyer. 

A probable cause hearing is scheduled for March 4. Police said Hicks was cooperating.
