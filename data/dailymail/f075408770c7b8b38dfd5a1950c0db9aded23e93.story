'Nightmares': The schoolgirl says she is so haunted by memories of the pain she caused that she now suffers from 'reverse post traumatic stress disorder' (picture posed by models)

A school bully has opened her heart about how she drove a classmate to suicideâ€¦ and the devastating effects it has had on her own life.

The schoolgirl, now grown up with children, says she is so haunted by memories of the pain she caused that she now suffers from 'reverse post traumatic stress disorder'.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the woman says she picked on one girl, called 'Gina', with such venom that she moved schools to begin a new life.

But Gina apparently never recovered from the torment and later committed suicide in high school - a fact the bully only learned years later when trying to track her down to apologise.

'There are no words to describe how monstrous I was,' she told Emily Yoffe, agony aunt for American website The Slate. 'If I inflicted half as much physical assault in my adulthood as I did to
her as a teen, I would be locked up for a very long time.'

She says she only realised the effects she must have had on her victims when her daughter, who she had aged 19, 'experienced some minor bullying' at school.

She saw how 'tormented' her daughter was and realised what she did to her classmates were 'way worse'.

So she made it her 'mission' to track down all the people she bullied in a bid to make amends for the pain she caused them.

It was a task made easier by the proliferation of social media such as Facebook and Friends Reunited.

She said most responded to her contrition 'with forgiveness', she would never be able to say sorry to the person who deserved it most - because she had killed herself having moved to a new school.

'I have very good reasons to believe that she switched schools because of
me,' she said. 'I have 
nightmares about what I did to her - it's like reverse PTSD where I 
remember the awful things I've done to others.'

She managed to get hold of Gina's mother's email address but is yet to find the 'guts' to make contact.

'What would I say,' she added. 'I know this sounds gutless but I'm also scared of any legal consequences I might face after I own up to my actions.'

Tragic: Last week, Felicia Garcia, 15, from Staten Island, new York, threw herself under a train as her horrified classmates watched, after posting pictures on the internet of herself with apparent bruises on her lip

There have been a spate of bullying related suicides in recent years across America.

Just last week, Felicia
Garcia, 15, from Staten Island, new York, threw herself under a train as her horrified classmates watched, later claiming she had been mercilessly targetted by bullies.

The 15-year-old, sobbing, put down her school bag and purposefully fell 
backwards to her death at the Huguenot Staten Island 
Railway station platform, which was packed with fellow Tottenville High 
School students.

Depressed: On her Instagram account, Miss Garcia had a picture of her eyes crossed over by the word 'Depressed' with the caption, 'just because someone is smiling doesn't make them happy'

The
teen, who friends claimed had long been tormented by school bullies, in
particular football players, tweeted on Monday: 'I cant. im done. I 
give up.'

The same day she 
posted photographs of herself on Instagram where she appears beaten and 
bruised, with her lips seemingly cut or sewn together. She added the 
hashtag 'beatup'.

In 2010, a global report on school violence identified bullying as the biggest problem in U.S. school playgrounds.

The report, by children's development 
organisation Plan International, estimated the total cost of all forms 
of youth violence at $158billion.

Meanwhile, according to data collected by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) around a fifth of high school students in the U.S. said they had experienced 
repeated, intentional bullying.

Marci Hertz, an adviser at CDC's Division
of Adolescent and School Health, said: 'Younger kids are more likely to be bullied and prevalence tends to be 
higher in middle school.'

She said girls are more likely to be bullied at school than boys.

Cases of bullying have become so high that CDC treats it as a public health issue.
