Sunderland defender Modibo Diakitè is considering buying out his contract at Sunderland and moving back to Fiorentina.

The centre-back spent the second half of last season on loan at the Serie A club having fallen out of favour under Sunderland boss Gus Poyet.

The 27-year-old joined the Black Cats on a free transfer from Lazio last summer when Paolo Di Canio was in charge but has only made eight appearances for the club.
