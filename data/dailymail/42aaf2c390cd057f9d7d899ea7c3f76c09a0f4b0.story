A New York TV news anchor's 20-year-old son has been charged with stealing a Chanel purse at a Manhattan club, court records say.

Louis Ruggiero, son of Good Day New York's Rosanna Scotto, was arrested just after 1.20am on Saturday when police officers saw him walking out of Marquee club with a purse under his jacket.

He was found in possession of the purse, a bag of cocaine and a false Illinois license, according to court records.

The bag is valued at more than $1,000 and belonged to a 40-year-old woman, according to the New York Daily News. 

Police found the woman, who had called 911 as Ruggiero, who's father is a lawyer, was being stopped by other officers.

She told cops that she had placed in on a bench behind her and ten minutes later it was gone, according to Page Six.

Ruggiero, who's also the grandson of former Gambino boss Anthony Scotto, was charged with grand larceny, criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a forged instrument. 

He had no prior arrests and was released  on his own recognizance on Saturday. 

Rosanna Scotto has been with Good Day New York on Fox 5 for more than 25 years. She co-hosts the show with Greg Kelly, the son of former NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. 

Her father, Anthony Scotto, was arrested in 1979 on federal bribery and racketeering charges. He was convicted for receiving cash payoffs of more than $200,000. 

He was sentenced to five years in jail in 1980 and was fined $75,000.
