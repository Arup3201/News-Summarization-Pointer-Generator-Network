One man has died and two dozen people have been hospitalised after a tour bus crashed and flipped onto its roof off a northern California interstate.

This was the second time in one day the bus was involved in an incident, after crashing into a  Denny's restaurant in Red Bluff, 50 miles from the second crash site.

The bus was enroute from Los Angeles to Pasco, Washington, when it went off Interstate 5 early this morning. 

Fatal accident: A 33-year-old man died in the crash and six people remain in hospital with critical or serious injuries after the incident in northern California

Six people were left with critical or serious injuries after the crash, which took place about 7.30am, around 100 miles south of the Oregon border.

The identity of the 33-year-old man from Parlier near Fresno, who was killed in the crash remains withheld until his relatives have been informed.  

Three patients remain are in critical condition, including one who was flown by helicopter to Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta with severe head injuries, hospital spokeswoman Joyce Zwanziger told the Sacramento Bee.

Three others are in serious condition at the same hospital's Redding location. The two dozen others who were treated at hospitals had mostly minor injuries and were released.

The bus, a 1996 Vanhool, was driven by Jose Victor Garcilazo, 67, of Los Angeles.

The bus had already crashed into a restaurant 50 miles down the road that morning, but no one was injured

Cause of crash: Police say drivers fatigue may have been a factor in both crashes

Injuries: Aside from the casualty and the six seriously injured, two dozen others who were treated at hospitals, but had mostly minor injuries and were released

Investigators said evidence at both crash sites show that driver fatigue may have been a factor.

They did not say whether drugs or alcohol may have been involved or whether any citations or charges were planned.

It wasn't clear how much damage was done in the initial crash or why the bus continued on its trip. Red Bluff police, who investigated the first crash, had no additional information on it Sunday night.

The bus operator, Yellow Arrow LLC, is based in Othello, Washington. It has a current license and before Sunday had no reported accidents in the past two years, according to federal records. 

The hospital was working with the Salvation Army and the Red Cross to assist patients who had been released, many of whom were staying at a hospitality house run by the medical center.

'We're just keeping them safe and comfortable,' Nichols said.
