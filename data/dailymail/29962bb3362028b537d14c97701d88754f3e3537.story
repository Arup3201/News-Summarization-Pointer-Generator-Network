Arsene Wenger has branded Chelsea supporters embroiled in the Paris Metro racism furore as 'pathetic'.

A collection of Blues fans were filmed making racist chants on the Paris underground whilst also preventing a black commuter from entering the carriage.

And speaking ahead of Arsenal's trip to Crystal Palace, Frenchman Wenger has blasted the people involved in the incident.

'It looked pathetic and dreadful, it seems we always have a recurrence of this problem,' said Wenger. 'We have to be severe in the punishment.

'It's a society problem. More intelligent people than myself think about that and nobody has found a miraculous solution, it certainly starts from childhood education and an open-minded attitude.

'There is a danger of having radical people in every society. Since I observed youth movements, there are always certain people who are ready for radical solutions and most of the time you have to control them.'

Wenger added: 'I don't think the managers agree with that kind of behaviour. Everybody has to fight against that. Why should you not? There's no reason at all.

'You have to be 100 per cent against that. It is absolutely ridiculous.'

Arsenal take on Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday and Wenger confirmed that Jack Wilshere is available after an absence of almost three months with an ankle ligament injury.

Hector Bellerin faces a fitness test ahead of the Premier League match, but it has come too soon for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who has only just returned to full training and Aaron Ramsey is still around 10 days away from his return.
