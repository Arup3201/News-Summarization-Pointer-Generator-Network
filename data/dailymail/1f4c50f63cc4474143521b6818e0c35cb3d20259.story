Adel Taarabt is a special talent who can inspire QPR to avoid relegation, according to chairman Tony Fernandes. 

Taarabt is back at QPR having spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan. He was expected to join the Italian giants permanently during the summer but the move collapsed as Milan refused to meet QPR's £6million valuation. 

The 25-year-old has only played a few minutes of Premier League football for Harry Redknapp's side this season - coming on as a 89th-minute substitute in the win over Sunderland last weekend - but Fernandes has backed him to surprise his critics.

 'I think Adel will be a surprise for many this season. He's focused and wants to stay at QPR. He can turn games around in a few minutes, so it's important to have him,' Fernandes told The Evening Standard.

'He is happy to be here. He was the best player at Burton Albion last week [in the Capital One Cup], even though we lost.

'Like many people who wrote off Joey [Barton] — and he was key for us last season — Adel is going to be something special.

'People have forgotten him a little bit but he can do extraordinary things. At AC Milan last season he was quite special.'
