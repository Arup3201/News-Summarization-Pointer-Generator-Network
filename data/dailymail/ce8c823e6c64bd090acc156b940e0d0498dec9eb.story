Earlier this week she showcased her enviable figure in a glamorous mini skirt and stillettos on a date night with boyfriend Nico Jackson.

But Pippa Middleton opted for a more casual look as she strolled through Chelsea this morning.

The party planner turned author donned a dark blue skirt, Converse All Star trainers and a white vest as she walked along London's trendy King's Road.

Pippa checked her iPhone as she walked through London unnoticed by the many passers-by.

The 29-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge looked fresh-faced and showcased a healthy tan with her hair down and over-sized sunglasses on. 

She accessorised her look with a pair of £130 Davina Combe Knot Drop Earrings with Amethyst.

Pippa is often spotted hanging out on the famous King's Road, which is home to some of her favorite haunts like Megan's restaurant and Raffles nightclub.

Whilst she is usually seen out and about with stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson, Pippa was flying solo today as she ran errands around London.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister has dated a string of aristocratic men in recent years, but has told friends Mr Jackson is ‘the one’.

Pippa is expected to announce her engagement within months, according to friends – and has been delaying the news out of deference to Kate, who gave birth to her first child last month.

A close friend of the lovestruck couple said in July: ‘An engagement is definitely on the cards.’

The couple have not been shy about displaying their affection and have been spotted canoodling on several occasions.

While she attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, he was educated at The Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and lived with his parents and sister Nina in a red-brick terraced house.

But after graduating from London’s Kingston University, Mr Jackson made his fortune as a stockbroker. 

Pippa has previously dated suitors from the upper echelons of society, including investment banker James Matthews and financier and former England cricketer Alex Loudon.
