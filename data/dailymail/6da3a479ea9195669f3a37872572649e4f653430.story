Olympic hockey star T.J. Oshie and his fiancee Lauren Cosgrove welcomed a daughter on St Patricks Day, but the new mom wasn't able to hold her daughter until more than a week later since Lyla Grace was born with a rare stomach condition.

Little Lyla was born with a condition called gastroschisis, meaning her intestines were born outside of her stomach.

After her birth, doctors placed Lyla's bowels in a silo and slowely returned them to her abdomen, mom Lauren explained in an Instagram post.

Once the intestines were back inside the infant's stomach, she underwent surgery to close the cavity.

According to the CDC, about 1,871 babies are born with the condition each year and there is a 90 per cent survival rate.

'Now we wait to see if she takes to feeding well,' Cosgrove wrote. 'Thanks again for all of the prayers and well wishes, we really, really, appreciate the support.'

The hockey-wife-to-be is due to speak more about her daughter's condition on the Today show Friday.

'She's been doing better than we could have ever hoped,' Cosgrove told TODAY in a preview excerpt of the interview.

'It was really upsetting,' Cosgrove said. 'It was tough at first.'

But it helps that she has her fiance Oshie for support.

'I'm usually a little more pessimist and he's more optimistic,' she said.

The couple made headlines late last year when Oshie was chosen to play on the U.S. Olympic Hockey team.

Cosgrove was in the final months of her pregnancy, and therefore wasn't able to travel with her fiance to Sochi.

As her soon-to-be-husband became an Olympic sensation, Cosgrove told reporters at home the tale of their romance.

'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' Cosgrove told KSDK.

The longtime couple met in North Dakota and Cosgrove moved to St Louis shortly after he joined the Blues.

He proposed to her on their 3-year anniversary, just before he left for Sochi, but a then 8-months pregnant Cosgrove had to stay home.

'I might go into labor,' Cosgrove joked about watching the nail-biting Olympic matches.

Oshie emerged as one of the real stars of the games after helping the U.S.propel past Russia in the tournament - a remarkable feat considering he barely made the team.

He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year.

Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win.

So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected.

Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game.

'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him.

'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.'
