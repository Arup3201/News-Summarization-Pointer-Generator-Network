Father-of-three Michael Calder was diagnosed with the virus by a doctor

A healthy 33-year-old real estate agent with three young children has died of viral meningitis after complaining of a headache for three days.

Top realtor Michael Calder, who has been described as an active adventure lover, was diagnosed with the virus by a doctor and died in hospital on July 11.

The Brisbane man's partner, Andrea Young, 42, has paid tribute to the 'amazing family man' who she fell in love with at a work function in 2004.

Mr Calder was a principal of Belle Property Ascot and had worked in the industry for 10 years.

'The situation is just dreadful but I have to be strong,' Ms Young told the Courier-Mail.

'We've got three boys aged four, six, and eight and I have to be strong for them.'

A testimonial on the Belle Property website described Mr Calder as a 'friendly professional' with an 'unparalleled record for consistently achieving outstanding results in his local market'.

'Michael's absolute passion for people and property makes him an enthusiastic agent, with highly developed negotiation skills to obtain the best result for his clients,' the website said.

Family man Mr Calder posted this photo of his partner's car on Facebook, writing: 'Congrats to my beautiful Andrea Young your new toy has arrived safe & sound...enjoy babe!'

As well as property, Mr Calder had a passion for camping, fishing and four-wheel drive adventures.

Most cases of viral meningitis are usually mild and most people usually recover in a week or two. It is very rare for the virus to be fatal.

Symptoms can be similar to those of the common flu and can develop quickly, over a matter of hours.

The main symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, and drowsiness or altered consciousness. Although the signs and symptoms do not appear in a definite order and some may not appear at all.
