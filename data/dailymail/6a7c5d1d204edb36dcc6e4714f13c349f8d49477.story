A mother-of-six who was once hooked on boob jobs admits she 'lost perspective' and has ended up with a 'comical' cleavage.

Now Gemma, 32, from Halifax, wants to have a reduction because she worries her double-F breasts are setting a bad example to her daughters.

'I absolutely hate them. They just look like two bald men's heads down my top. It's like something from a Carry On film, they look comical,' she told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers.

The working mother revealed how she had her breasts enlarged in her early twenties when she felt insecure about her appearance. 

She said: 'I said to the surgeon I want the biggest you can put in. I thought once I had a boob job, all my problems would be solved and I'd feel amazing. I lost perspective.'

She said she didn't feel like a 'proper woman' when she was flat-chested so she hoped enhancing her A cup to a double-F would make her feel more vivacious.

She said it worked at first and in her twenties, she loved going out and showing them off.

But now as a married mother-of-six, she feels they attract unwanted attention. 

'They give the impression I want people to look at me and I really don't. I'm not proud of these, they reflect an insecurity I once had. Now they make me feel more self-conscious,' she admitted.

Her husband, Lewis agrees. he said: 'Going out and about with Gemma she gets a lot of attention from men. They don't look at her face, they look at her boobs and that really annoys me.'

Gemma admitted she is most concerned about the message she is sending to her daughters Sky, 10, and Pearl, five, with her cosmetically enhanced cleavage.

She said: 'I have two impressionable daughters who look up to their mum. It worries me that I may have normalised massive breast implants to my daughters. 

'How can I tell them to love themselves as they are when I'm here with massive breast implants. I want to show them a woman is much more than a pair of breasts.'

Gemma is prepared to go under the knife one more time to have another operation to take her chest size down to a D cup.

After her former implants are removed - which weighed a hefty half a kg each - Gemma said she finally feels confident again.

She said: 'I'm thrilled to bits with the results. Those two bald headed men have disappeared, I don't have a shelf anymore, just a smooth, natural curve.

'I feel a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders- or rather my chest.'
