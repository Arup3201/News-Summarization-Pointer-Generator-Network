It will be Devon’s answer to the Angel Of The North: a giant statue of a naked pregnant woman holding a sword above her head.

The monumental sculpture – which is a full ten inches higher than its 66ft North East counterpart – is  the brainchild of controversial artist Damien Hirst, who wants to erect it in a car park at Ilfracombe harbour.

Hirst, who lives in a £3.5 million farmhouse just outside the resort, has told local councillors they can have the statue on loan for 20 years if they grant him the necessary planning permission.

Controversiial: Damien Hirst wants to erect a giant statue of a pregnant woman in a car park in Ilfracombe, Devon

Hirst’s idea for an ‘Angel of the West’ has already divided opinion and some residents in the town, which is a teenage pregnancy blackspot, have instead dubbed it ‘The Belly of the South’.

But the proposal is expected to be given the go-ahead by councillors convinced it will attract hundreds of thousands of visitors.

It would also be a boon for Hirst’s restaurant, 11 The Quay, which is just 100 yards from the proposed site.

Planners will make their decision in September, and the sculpture, which currently exists in three sections, could be in place two months later.

Councillor Mike Edmunds said: ‘We have got to find new ways of attracting visitors.

'We are lucky to have an artist of Damien’s stature in the area and we want to start rebranding the town in the area of the arts rather than as just a traditional resort.’

Another councillor, Philip Webb, added: ‘It is going to make a big  difference to the town and the local economy.

'Damien wants to make a statement and this statue certainly does that.

'I think it’s a wonderful idea and I’d be surprised if anyone opposed it.’

The bronze finished figure, which has a stainless-steel frame, will hold a glass-fibre sword aloft and a pair of scales behind her back and stand on a plinth of law books, staring out to sea.

The scales and sword are similar to those carried by the Statue of Justice on the roof of the Old Bailey.

One local source last night said 47-year-old Hirst had added the books at the 11th hour to ensure it would be taller than Antony Gormley’s Angel Of The North, erected in 1998.

English Heritage has no objection to Hirst’s sculpture, thought to be the latest part of his Virgin Mother series, on the edge of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Historic buildings inspector Francis Kelly said: ‘This sounds like an important and thought-provoking project that would add a considerable amount of interest to Ilfracombe.’

But council planners may have reckoned without public opinion.

Bobby Davies, 69-year-old social secretary of Ilfracombe Yacht Club, said: ‘Oh, please no. Tell me they’re not really going to do this.

‘People will come to look  at it – probably to have a good laugh at our expense. Given Ilfracombe’s past problems with teenage pregnancies I can’t believe this is so in-your-face.

Overshadowed: The proposed statue would be 10 inches taller than Antony Gormley's Angel Of The North, erected near Gateshead in 1998

'Why couldn’t we have had a fisherman or a seafarer?’

Resident Maureen Lowe, 63, said: ‘About five per cent of local people will go along with this. You can bet it will be called the Belly of the South around here.

'Personally I quite like the statue but it’s just too big.’

Hirst was unavailable for comment last night.

Damien Hirst, once among the most exciting of young British artists, has seen his reputation challenged.

Similarities: Hirst's proposed work resembles Paul Day's £1m statue, The Meeting Place, erected at St Pancras

Critics have described this summer’s exhibition of his still lifes as ‘deluded’ in its incompetence, while his Tate retrospective has received mixed reviews.

Some have speculated that the prices  of his art in the auction  room are inflated and must soon collapse.

Now he is proposing this giant piece which has the same naive awkwardness of any number of new public statues.

It looks, in style, very much like Paul Day’s £1 million statue at St Pancras of lovers embracing, probably the ugliest statue in London.

Councillor Paul Crabb thinks locals would be ‘delighted’ by Hirst’s statue, which will certainly be impossible to ignore.

What has encouraged this sort of misguided thinking is the Angel Of The North –  a grand and unique image created by an artist, Antony Gormley, on peak form.

All sorts of proposed rubbish has followed.

Hirst’s soppy, banal and overblown statue has nothing in common with Gormley’s, apart from size.

It looks like a small statue, made by an ordinarily competent worker in an uninteresting style, blown up to the size of a lighthouse. 

And I bet plans for selling reproductions to tourists are, by now, completely prepared.
