Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans, who now sits as an independent MP, denies all charges

Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans should not be convicted of rape just to ‘salve the conscience’ of a man who regrets having sex with him, a jury was told yesterday.

A 22-year-old politics student who claimed the MP assaulted him after a dinner party had in reality given ‘every indication of consent’, said Peter Wright QC, representing Evans.

‘In the cold light of day, the complainant may regret what had taken place and how far it had actually gone, but such sentiments are some considerable distance removed from an incident of sexual assault and rape,’ he told Preston Crown Court.

‘Salving his conscience is not the basis on which to convict a man of rape and sexual assault.’

The former Tory MP, who now sits as an independent, is accused by the prosecution of using his influence at Westminster to target politically ambitious young men, knowing they would not complain about his advances.

Evans admits having sex with the student but insists the young man – who admits he never said ‘No’ – appeared to be an entirely willing participant. Mr Wright also said that two incidents in 2003 when men claim that the 56-year-old MP tried to put his hands down their trousers – one in a Soho bar, one at the Tory conference in Blackpool – did not support the prosecution case of a politician abusing his influence.

‘They are a high watermark of over-friendly, inappropriate behaviour by a drunken man, rather than the ingredients of an indecent assault,’ he added.

Evans is also accused of trying to kiss a 21-year-old gay man in 2009 and grabbing a heterosexual man between the legs the following year, both at the Strangers’ Bar at the Houses of Parliament.

Mr Evans's lawyer told Preston Crown Court that the allegation were motivated by the claimant's regret

But Mr Wright said police learnt of both complainants from another of the alleged victims, a bisexual man who claims Evans assaulted him while he slept on the sofa of his constituency home in Lancashire in 2009.

The barrister said this complainant gave police details of these alleged incidents to ‘bolster’ his account but had initially mixed the pair up.

He said the version given in court by the man allegedly grabbed between the legs bore ‘little resemblance’ to what he told police. Meanwhile, the bisexual man’s account ‘does not sit comfortably’ with the fact he continued socialising with Evans afterwards.

The MP denies all the charges. The case continues.
