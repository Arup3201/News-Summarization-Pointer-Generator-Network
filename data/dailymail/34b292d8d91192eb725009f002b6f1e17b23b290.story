Jimmy Savile was implicated in the Haut de la Garenne children's home scandal, according to the former head of the Jersey child abuse investigation

Lenny Harper said he now has 'no reason to doubt' that Savile indecently assaulted girls at the Jersey children's home which came under intense scrutiny in 2008.

His comments came on the day that the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, ordered a belated inquiry into the abuse scandal and offered an apology to Savile's victims.

Harper, the States of Jersey police detective who led a three-year child abuse probe, told the Guardian that Savile's name came up in the initial police inquiry four years ago.

However, he added that there were no specific allegations of abuse against the BBC presenter at the time.

Mr Harper, who has since retired from the force, added: 'There definitely wasn't enough even to question him at the time, but in light of all the evidence that has come out then I'm not surprised because it fits perfectly the profile of what was going on.'

The institution was subject to a huge police investigation after allegations of historic child abuse at the home.

A solicitor who acted for victims also
 told the Guardian that some former Haut de la Garenne residents, both 
women and men, now claim they were assaulted by Savile in the 1970s.

Alan
 Collins, a solicitor for several Haut de la Garenne victims, said 'a 
handful' of former residents have now made abuse allegations about 
Savile.

He said Savile's 
name was mentioned several times during the police investigation of 2008
 but  the evidence did not seem to stack up at the time.

Police on the island confirmed last 
week that Savile was investigated as part of the 2008 inquiry into abuse
 at the children's home.

It followed claims from a former Haut de la Garenne resident that Savile was involved in an indecent assault in the 1970s.

The BBC entertainer, who died last October aged 84, was never charged with any abuse offences.

Mr Entwistle 
yesterday admitted knowing about the Newsnight investigation into Savile when
 he ploughed ahead with eulogies showering tributes on the presenter.

He
 expressed ‘deep regret’ over ‘these awful allegations’ as he announced 
his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry 
was necessary.

Newsnight's 
film was shelved, and instead viewers and listeners were treated to a 
series of programmes lavishing praise on Savile after his death.

Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir Jimmy Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice

Nationwide inquiry: Staff at the BBC have been urged to come forward with information about Jimmy Savile's alleged reign of abuse as police forces across the country receive more allegations

At least seven police forces are now examining claims he raped and molested schoolgirls during four decades as a radio and TV presenter.

Detectives will also probe whether Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice. Both women have reported their claims to police.

A week ago, the corporation insisted it had ‘no evidence' of any abuse, but yesterday Mr Entwistle told Radio 4 he wanted to apologise to women victims ‘on behalf of the organisation …for what they've had to endure here'.

Presenter Evan Davies asked him why the BBC ran a eulogy on Savile after evidence of abuse surfaced during the Newsnight inquiry.

Mr Entwistle, who was the BBC's Head of Vision at the time, said: ‘I didn't know what had become of that investigation, I didn't know what discoveries, if any, that they had.'

Last week it was announced that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood in a virtually unprecedented move, if the extraordinary claims that he sexually abused young girls are found to be true.

The TV host was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971.

But a Cabinet Office source said that a knighthood could be removed after an individual’s death if they are officially censured by a professional body or convicted of a criminal offence.

The calls for him to be stripped of his knighthood were backed by a 65-year-old woman, who claimed she became pregnant after the presenter raped her when she was a virgin aged 16.
