Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers gave up his free Sunday to join striker Daniel Sturridge in a training session to test his fitness ahead of this week's key Champions League clash in Basle.

Sturridge, who has missed Liverpool's last five matches after picking up a thigh injury on international duty with England, was put through his paces at the club's Melwood training ground - with Rodgers also taking part in the same routine under the watchful eye of two of the club's coaching staff.

The Anfield boss, who has successfully lost weight during his two years at the club, joined his 25-year-old international in a series of sprints, slaloms, jogs and agility drills using rope ladders.

Although Liverpool haven't yet confirmed whether Sturridge is fit to return on Wednesday night, the forward looked pain-free as he completed the strenuous work-out and Rodgers was all smiles 24 hours after seeing his side held 1-1 by Everton in the Merseyside derby.

Rodgers was furious that Sturridge received his injury in an England training session after Liverpool's medical staff had passed on detailed information about his condition.

Liverpool have failed to win a Premier League game since but they do go to Switzerland having who their opening game in Europe against Bulgaria's Ludogorets.

Even so, Rodgers is clearly leaving no stone unturned trying to get Sturridge back - including sacrificing his own free time.
