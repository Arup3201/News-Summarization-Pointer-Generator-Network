Parents will now have to pay up to $90 for their child to fly alone on a Qantas flight.

The increase in young kids flying without a parent has risen, prompting the Australian airline to charge a fee. 

Children aged five to 11 who are travelling domestically without an adult will cost parents $50 in travelling fees, while international flights will see parents paying $90 for their children to travel alone. Kids travelling alone for longer than  six hours have to be at least six-years-old.

The Qantas fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15

The fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15, Traveller reports. 

The new charges for children travelling without an adult will  double if payment is not made before arriving at the airport - $100 for domestic and $180 for international.

If your child is travelling to multiple destinations unaccompanied make sure each flight has been made on one booking, as travel agents are told the fee is only for each booking, not for each flight.

'Qantas recognises the importance of providing children travelling alone with the highest levels of comfort and support,' a spokeswoman said. 

'Given the increasing demand for this extra support, and the increasing costs involved, we cannot continue to provide this service completely free of charge. This change brings Qantas in line with many of its domestic and international competitors.'

Children who are travelling alone on a Qantas flight are offered 'additional administration at airports, immigration and security processing for international flights, onboard assistance and a ground staff escort at the airport', writes the Traveller. 

Lay-over rooms are also provided at some airports for young people waiting to board a flight. 

'The introduction of an Unaccompanied Minor Supervision Fee will assist in recovering some of the additional costs of the extra services and facilities provided for the comfort and safety of children travelling without a parent or guardian,' the Qantas spokeswoman said. 

Compared to other airlines, Qantas does not have a restriction against the number of children who are allowed to travel on a flight alone.

These charges have already been put in place by Virgin Australia, who charge parents  $40 per flight on domestic and $60 per flight on international for children aged 5 to 11 travelling alone.

Children who travel without an adult are seated closer to cabin crew, according to Virgin's website. 

Airline companies have coped slack for their strategy for not sitting men next to children travelling alone.

Qantas has no maximum number of how many unaccompanied children are allowed to travel on a flight
