She is known for writing about  her colourful private life, her dramatic conversion to Islam and a spectacular falling-out with her half-sister, Cherie Blair.

So perhaps it’s no surprise that when Lauren Booth decided she wanted a new husband, she advertised on Facebook.

And after announcing her quest for a partner to her 7,000 Facebook ‘friends’ last year, Ms Booth, 45, has now announced she is wed.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal her husband is Sohale Ahmed, a devout Muslim and divorced father of three from Stockport, Manchester.

Mr Ahmed must have survived a stern examination of his credentials to earn Ms Booth’s affections. For in her Facebook announcement, she promised a ‘series of rigorous tests of din [religion], finances and personality’.

He would have to have his own teeth and be able to ‘pray’ and to ‘pay’, she added. Secret drinkers, CIA stooges and anyone who  fancied Sunday roast at her brother-in-law Tony Blair’s house were told they need not apply.

The journalist and broadcaster – a vocal opponent of the Iraq War who now works for Iran’s state-owned news channel Press TV – said anyone who wished to have lunch with Mr Blair was discounted because it meant they liked eating with ‘Muslim-murdering former leaders’.

‘Still interested?’ Ms Booth asked at the end of the advert. ‘Well, you’d better be brave and funny.’

Despite issuing such a daunting challenge, Ms Booth has now reported her marriage on Facebook. Mr Ahmed is listed as the managing director of Ms Booth’s pro-Palestinian charity, Peace 2012.

Her 49-year-old new husband has also posted Facebook pictures of Ms Booth.

It is unclear how the couple met, but Ms Booth, a devout Muslim and human-rights activist, has spoken at various rallies and events, produced by Mr Ahmed through his company X Events.

It is not the first time Facebook has played a major role in Ms Booth’s life.

Strict criteria: Activist Lauren Booth announced that she was looking for a partner on Facebook

In 2009, she changed her Facebook status from ‘married’ to ‘divorced’, following a row with her first husband Craig Darby when they and their two daughters lived in France.

Days later, a serious motorbike accident left him with brain injuries.

The accident and recovery were documented by Ms Booth in newspaper articles.

Though she had admitted that changing her Facebook status was juvenile, she later wrote that despite being grateful her husband had survived the crash, the man she had loved was dead.

‘I miss my dead husband, his passion and his bravery,’ she wrote.

The couple divorced in 2011.
