Michael Schumacher has displayed 'moments of consciousness and awakening,' his agent Sabine Kehm has said.

The seven-times Formula One world champion has been in a coma for almost 100 days following a skiing accident in the French Alps in December.

'Michael is making progress on his way,' the statement released on Friday said. 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening.

New hope: Michael Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has said he has shown 'moments of consciousness'

Support: A message of support for Michael Schumacher on the main straight of the Bahrain International Circuit

Honoured: The F1 legend, who is in a coma, has also had Turn 1 of the Sakhir circuit named in his honour

Gulf between: One of the greatest ever in motor sport, the German won the first Bahrain race in 2004

Message of support: Fans at the Malaysian Grand Prix wear t-shirts with the message 'Praying For You Schumi'

'We are on his side during his long 
and difficult fight, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble,
 and we keep remaining confident.

'We would like to thank you all for the continuous sympathies.

'At the same time we again ask for understanding that we do not intend to disclose details.

'This is necessary to protect the privacy of Michael and his family and to enable the medical team to work in full calmness.'

Schumacher has been in an induced coma at the Grenoble Hospital since he fell while skiing on December 29.

Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'wakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes. He said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night hours).'

And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment.

He said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these signs are not constantly present.

One of the greats: Schumacher won a record 91 races and seven world titles during his Formula One career

Michael is making progress on his way. He shows moments of 
consciousness and awakening. We are on his side during his long 
and difficult fight, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble,
 and we keep remaining confident. We would like to thank you all for the continuous sympathies. At the same time we again ask for understanding that we do not intend to disclose details. This is necessary to protect the privacy of Michael and his family and to enable the medical team to work in full calmness.

'For example, if Michael smiles when a
 member of his entourage talks to him - reproducibly and consistently on
 at least a few occasions. Or following people with his eyes. Or trying 
to communicate, or obeying simple commands. Any of this constitutes 
objective signs of contact between the "outside" and the "inside". This 
then would be a minimally conscious state. And that is about the best 
news we could possibly get right now.'

Despite the encouraging statement, it is understood the 45-year-old will not be moved from hospital in the imminent future.

His
 family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in reports that
 his wife Corinna has built a medical suite at their home in 
Switzerland.

The Bahrain International Circuit, venue for this weekend's grand prix, has renamed Turn 1 in honour of the former Ferrari, Benetton, and Mercedes driver.

Progress: The latest update from Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm - and the first for just over three weeks - again offers hope the 45-year-old will somehow make a miracle recovery

The armco along the main straight has
 also been painted with a message of support reading: 'Our thoughts and 
prayers are with you Michael'.

Track
 chairman Zayed Al Zayani said: 'With the support of his family, it is a
 great privilege to be able to honour arguably the greatest racing 
driver in the history of F1 and someone who the people of Bahrain hold 
close to their hearts.

'From his first appearance at the BIC in 2004, he immediately became an inspiration for all those who love motorsport in the Kingdom and it is therefore natural for us to recognise him in this way.

'The team at the BIC continues to offer Michael and his family its best wishes.'

Schumacher was placed in an induced coma after undergoing two separate operations to remove blood clots from his brain following his accident on December 29.

Mercedes, who the German returned to the sport with in 2010, added on Friday: 'Positive news from Grenoble today. Michael: you are in our hearts, keep fighting as only you can.'
