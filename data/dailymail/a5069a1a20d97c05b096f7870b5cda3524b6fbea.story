Other shots include the large welcome sign outside the fictional resort of Amity which featured in the movie.

Elsewhere, there is a picture of the 'Orca', the wooden fishing boat used to hunt down the man-eating great white shark, and a snap of the sand dunes also seen in the film.

Along with the photo album, the archive includes red and orange life jackets worn by Spielberg, Scheider and co-stars Robert Shaw who played 'Quint' and Richard Dreyfuss who starred as 'Hooper'.

The life vests are marked with 'Jaws' and 'Orca'.

The archive was amassed by a nautical technician who worked on the set.

It is being sold by his family through Nate D Sanders auctioneers of Los Angeles with a pre-sale estimate of $30,000.

Numerous documents make up the collection including 'shooting call' sheets issued to the cast and crew.

One of the sheets is dated September 18, 1974, when three scenes were shot which were 'Alex Kintner's death', 'Brody and Hooper swim in' and 'Brucie's demise (the explosion)'.

Brucie was the nickname given to the model shark and the remark refers to the penultimate scene in which Brody blows it up by shooting an oxygen canister in its mouth.

The 1975 release of the classic thriller Jaws is regarded by some as a watershed moment in film history.

The film follows a police chief, a marine scientist and a grizzled fisherman as they set out to stop a great white shark terrorising the small island community of Amity.

It became the highest-grossing film of all time and was the most successful motion picture of all time until Star Wars. Adjusted for inflation, it currently stands at seven on the all time top grossing list. Gone With The Wind is top.

The film, often cited as one of the greatest of all time, has spawned a number of memorable quotes, including Broady's line 'You're going to need a bigger boat'.

It also helped to establish a model followed by Hollywood for years after, which sees a blockbuster action film with a 'high-concept' premise released in the summer with heavy advertising.

Other documents in the archive are 
menus for restaurants in Menemsha, a fishing village on Martha's 
Vineyard, New England, US, where the movie was shot.

There
 is also a rosta of all the cast and crew and the names of the hotels 
and bed and breakfasts they were staying in during the filming which 
took place between June and September 1974.

Laura
 Yntema, of Nate D Sanders, said: 'Jaws was one of Spielberg's first 
movies that he directed and this archive is very important for that 
reason but also because it was one of the major movies of the 1970s.

'You would think that for such an important movie there would be a lot more souveniers from it but this was before people started to collect movie memoribilia and a lot of things were just thrown out.

'We have never come across memoribilia like this from Jaws before.

'It was collected by a nautical technician who worked on the set and there are quite a few picture of him and his wife around the island.'

The auction was due to take place tomorrow.
