David Cameron was last night facing a new cronyism row after appointing an old Etonian baronet as his new Chief Whip.

Tory MPs criticised the Prime Minister’s  ‘patrician’ decision to give the key role to Sir George Young, following Andrew Mitchell’s resignation.

Backbenchers claimed the job should have gone to a down-to-earth Tory MP – not to Sir George, 71, the former Commons leader who left the Government only a month ago.

Embarrassing: Sir George has been an MP since 1974. In 1982 he appeared with his children and Jimmy Savile on a British Rail poster promoting the transport of bicycles by rail

Senior backbencher Brian 
Binley said: ‘It seems the Prime Minister needs his little comfort zone 
around him. It’s as though he is in his bunker and they are protecting 
him.’

Another Tory MP said privately: ‘George is a nice guy but why the hell make him Chief Whip?

'Cameron
should have given the job to a new, fresh face. It just smacks of the 
way Cameron runs the Government as a kind of clique.’

There
is rising concern within the Tory Party that it is losing touch with 
working-class voters in the wake of the row over Mr Mitchell allegedly 
calling No 10 policemen ‘plebs’.

Today in The Mail on Sunday, backbencher Nadine Dorries adds her voice to the growing chorus of discontent.
