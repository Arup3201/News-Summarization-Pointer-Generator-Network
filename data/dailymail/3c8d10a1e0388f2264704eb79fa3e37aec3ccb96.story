Newly released footage from the Ferguson, Missouri, police department recorded on the day of Michael Brown's fatal shooting shows officer Darren Wilson emerging from the building on his way to the hospital just hours after the deadly encounter with the unarmed teenager.

The brief video recording has been provided by the Ferguson police to the St Louis Post-Dispatch Friday in response to a formal freedom of information act request.

The first clip shows the officer in plainclothes, dressed in a white T-shirt and dark pants, leaving the police precinct with two other men on his way to the hospital.

Wilson, seen left and right, was caught on camera emerging from the police precinct dressed in a white T-shirt en route to a hospital 

Another video depicts the Ferguson cop returning to the police headquarters two and a half hours later.

Mr Wilson has not been seen publicly since he was photographed standing over Brown’s lifeless body on August 9. Therefore, the video of Wilson's return to the police precinct that night marks the last time he was caught on camera.

Along with the videos, the Post-Dispatch Friday published transcripts of radio recordings from the Brown shooting, showing that the teen was gunned down less than a minute and a half after first encountering Wilson. .

Audio from the moments before and after Darren Wilson opened fired on Brown, 18, were also obtained under Missouri's freedom of information laws.

Combined with other accounts from the day, the radio accounts seem to show that Brown was dead on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, just over a minute after Wilson said that he was about to confront him.

Among the released audio records, however, the Post-Dispatch has been unable to locate the call Wilson has claimed he'd made to the dispatcher after firing the first shot at Brown.

Final glimpse: This marks the last time Wilson has been seen in public since August   

At 12.02pm on 9 August, Wilson said: '21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.' Canfield is the name of the street where the shooting happened, and two is a reference to the fact Brown was with a friend.

By 12.03pm a tweet from a bystander had been posted, saying: 'I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE'. According to Analysis by the Post-Dispatch, this means the encounter could have lasted as little as 61 seconds.

The recordings provide new fragments of information on the hotly-contested encounter, which has sparked a wave of protests and accusations of racism.

Leaked accounts of Wilson's version of events tell of Brown attacking Wilson in his police SUV and almost knocking him out - before the officer manages to grab his gun and fire.

Contrary to accounts of Brown surrendering, the accounts of Wilson's statements say the teen 'charged' even after he was shot.

About 30 minute before the shooting, at 11.29am, a police dispatcher sent Darren Wilson as reinforcement in a domestic violence case, followed by a call about a sick baby.

At 11.53am, Wilson hears over his radio a report about a 'stealing in progress' at the Ferguson Market. The dispatcher then gives a description of the suspect: a black male in a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip bodega with a box of stolen Swisher-brand cigars.

Aftermath: Wilson is seen standing over the slain Brown,  moments after firing on him repeatedly

The dispatcher later offers more detail on the suspect, saying that he is wearing a red Cardinals hat, yellow socks and khaki shorts, and that he is accompanied by another man.

At noon, Wilson radios in that he is back on duty and asks his fellow officers searching for the suspects in the theft if they require assistance. Seven seconds later, he learns that the suspects have disappeared.

Two minutes later, Officer Wilson contacts the dispatcher telling him that he is on Canfield with two suspects in his sights and is in need of assistance.

Sources told the Post-Dispatch that before he made the report, Wilson allegedly told Michael Brown and his companion, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the street, but they ignored his plea, at which point he realized that one of them, Brown, matched the description of the suspected cigar thief.

While waiting for backup, Wilson said that Brown attacked him first and a struggle ensued, with the teenager grabbing for his gun. Wilson was eventually able to squeeze out two shots from his service weapon, hitting Brown once and prompting him to flee.

Wilson would later tell investigators that immediately after the shooting he called in, ‘Shots fired, send all cars,' but during the struggle the channel on his radio switched, so the call never went through.

The Post-Dispatch reviewed recordings made on other radio channels in Ferguson at the time but could not find a trace of Wilson's call. The newspaper noted that at least one channel on the police radio was 'receive-only.'

The officer then jumped out of his car and went in pursuit of Brown.

According to Wilson, the teenager stopped in his tracks, reversed course and charged at him, prompting the cop to fire a shot, followed by several more after a brief pause.

Some accounts say that Wilson choked Brown and tried to drag him into the SUV, while others say he was shot in the back while fleeing. Witnesses have said he was raising his hands in submission.  

At 12.07pm, about four minutes after the deadly encounter, a woman could be heard wailing in the background as an officer who arrived on the scene as backup radioed in: 'Get us several more units over here. There’s gonna be a problem.' 

A grand jury is currently deliberating on whether to indict Wilson over the shooting, and is expected to make its decision this month.

If Wilson is not indicted, he can expect his job back immediately, although his next assignment is yet to be determined, Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson told Yahoo! News.

Conversely, if charged with a felony, Wilson would probably be terminated, the chief said.

On Saturday, Jackson spoke to the press clarifying his earlier remarks about Wilson's employment status.

'I am not saying that I want Officer Wilson to return or that I don’t want him to return,' Jackson told msnbc. 'Legally speaking, if he is not indicted he can return to his job. If he is indicted on felony charges, which these would be, he will be fired.

'But even if he is not indicted he will be subject to an internal investigation,” Jackson added. The results of that investigation, according to Jackson, may or may not lead to Wilson’s termination.'

Brown's parents have insisted that there is enough evidence to indict Wilson and put him on trial, but according to unnamed police sources, the grand jury is unlikely to take that step.

'Intimidation': The Brown family has also demanded that Missouri's Governor apologize for the treatment of protesters, who were met with a heavy police presence

Attorneys for the family released a statement Saturday in response to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch story, criticizing the police.

'From the very beginning, the Ferguson Police Dept. has followed what is now seemingly standard operating procedure for police departments around the country: to vilify the victim and put the shooter on a pedestal,' the statement said.

'Information was leaked from within the police department that Wilson was severely beaten and suffered an orbital eye socket "blowout," indicating that Michael Brown somehow deserved to die.

'From the video released today it would appear the initial descriptions of his injuries were exaggerated.

'The audio clearly demonstrates that the initial interaction with the officer and Brown had nothing to do with the incident at the convenience store. The remaining portions of the audiotape did not establish any connection with the convenience store incident.
