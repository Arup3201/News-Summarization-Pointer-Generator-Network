In the end, Gary Neville’s joke about the Dog & Duck turned out to be an insult to the Dog & Duck.

The plan was to keep Fabian Frei, Marco Streller and Taulant Xhaka quiet for just long enough to give Liverpool a chance to progress into the last 16 of the Champions League.

The reality is that this team cannot keep a clean sheet when it really matters. Matchday six, at Anfield, was win or bust.

The lights are out on Liverpool’s Champions League dream and it will take a special person to solve the problems in this defence.

Liverpool have now gone seven Champions League games without keeping a clean sheet. That’s their longest run in the competition since November 2008. 

Basel scored here at Anfield because you always knew that they were going to score. Liverpool conceded in all six group games: ‘We just weren’t good enough,’ admitted Brendan Rodgers.

In the aftermath, their gutsy second half performance is worth recording, but the brutal truth is that this team was pretty much done when Fabian Frei scored a beaut in the 25th minute.

Rodgers admitted it was time to go back to basic when they conceded three at Crystal Palace on November 23. After this it is very much back to the beginning.

Simon Mignolet? Timid. Glen Johnson? Wasteful. Martin Srktel? Chaotic. Dejan Lovren? Apprehensive. Jose Enrique? Forget it.

If this is what £64million gets you these days then let’s hope Liverpool have kept the receipt. They are damaged, possibly beyond repair.

Where is the guidance? Who is marking who? Who is the leader in that back line? No-one can really say for sure.

Liverpool are out because in six group games - home and away against Real Madrid, Ludogorets and Basel - there isn’t a single player in their defence taking responsibility for marking and positioning when they are in or out of possession. ‘We have to be better, it’s simple,’ added Rodgers.

Amazingly, when they were forced to play three at the back after the dismissal of substitute Lazar Markovic, there was a smidgen of improvement.

The confidence has been drained from this Liverpool team and it has come to the stage where their credibility as top class players is being tested to the limit. Anfield is no place to hide.

They have witnessed some of the great defenders over the years, from Alan Hansen, Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson, Ron Yeats to Jamie Carragher, walk through the Shankly Gates.

The current group, including substitute Alberto Moreno, do not belong in that category.

Using the surprise absence of Kolo Toure, a Champions League finalist with Arsenal in 2006, as a reason for Liverpool’s exit is stretching the imagination a little bit too far.

The warning signs were there when Liverpool conceded 51 times on the way to finishing second in the Barclays Premier League last season.

Part of the answer was to spend £24m on Lovren and the poor fella has been an unmitigated disaster since his move from Southampton.

To think Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho once paid £20m for Ricardo Carvalho a few weeks after Porto won the Champions League in 2004. For that they got the finished article.

Lovren was booked, inevitably, in the second half when he shoved  Xhaka in the back just as the Basle winger was combing through Liverpool’s midfield.

His first half performance was just as baffling and heaven knows what he was thinking in the opening minute when he demanded the ball from his keeper on the edge of the area. He’s not good enough for that.

Over the next four days this Liverpool defence will need to address some fairly serious issues before they head on to their next fixture at Old Trafford against the Red Lion.

As for the rest, it’s just pub talk.
