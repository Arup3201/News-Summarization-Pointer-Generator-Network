Real World: Skeletons star Violetta Milerman has revealed her secret struggle with anorexia and bulimia after her four-year battle was harshly exposed on the MTV show by a castmember with whom she had confided in.

The 24-year-old's roommate Bruno Bettencourt, 24, called her 'ugly and anorexic' during a volatile fight in their shared Chicago loft on last night's episode of the reality series, which forces its stars to face 'skeletons' or people from their past.

Violetta told Cosmopolitan that although she is 'not ashamed' of having an eating disorder, she was upset that Bruno had publicly betrayed her confidence because she never intended to share her secret on the show.

Private confession: Violetta Milerman, 24, revealed her eating disorder on Real World: Skeletons after another castmember exposed her secret four-year battle

She explained that her family didn't even know about her struggles before the episode aired. She also added that she had been 'doing really well' before the show.

'Coming into the house, my eating disorder wasn't a problem,' she said. 'But after being there for so long, and just going through the stress of it, it just became so overwhelming, and I started to lose faith in who I was.'

She continued: 'With me, it's a control thing. The reason I do it is because something is happening in my life that I can't control. And I need that feeling of control. But I didn't voluntarily bring this up in the house.'  

In the beginning of the episode, Violetta's other roommates privately shared their concerns about her weight loss. After her confrontation with Bruno, she admitted that she isn't happy until her rib cage is showing.

'I think everyone in the house kind of had an idea already,' she told Cosmopolitan. 'I mean, it's pretty obvious if you're binging and purging between meals when you're living with people full-time.'

While she 'wasn't ready' to bring it up on the show, Violetta said 'everyone in the house was very supportive.' 

She also expressed her desire to help others now that her secret has been revealed.

In a video for MTV, Violetta said that she forgives Bruno for what he said that night, but she can't 'forgive him for actions after that'.

She added: 'I don't think that you can honestly forgive anyone who talks about you darkest secret - especially one that you didn't want to bring to the show.'
