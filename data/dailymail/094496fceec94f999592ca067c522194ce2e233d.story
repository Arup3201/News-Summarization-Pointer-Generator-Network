Ukraine accused Russia of invasion today, after Vladimir Putin ordered a controversial aid convoy into the country because he could 'wait no longer'.

The Russian President held telephone talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and, according to the Kremlin, expressed 'serious concern' about the military escalation in eastern Ukraine and admitted he had lost patience in the stand-off over the convoy.

Hundreds of lorries that Russia claims are carrying humanitarian aid but which Ukraine insists have a military purpose were sent over the border this morning without permission from the Kiev government, which added that its border guards had been 'blocked'.

Tensions in the six-month crisis rose to dangerous levels, as senior Ukrainian officials warned that an attack on the fleet of white trucks could be staged by pro-Russian militants to give a pretext for a full-scale Kremlin occupation of eastern regions of the country.

Such a development would trigger a full-scale war on the European Union's doorstep. 

Nato last night issued a savage rebuke of the Russian  move.

'It can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel,' warned chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

He suspected the convoy was not to help hungry people hit by the civil war but 'to resupply armed separatists'.

Sending in Moscow's trucks was a 'blatant breach' of Russia's international commitments and a 'further violation of Ukraine's sovereignty', he said.

The Kremlin was guilty of 'a major escalation in Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine since mid-August', including the use of Vladimir Putin's forces.

Mr Putin said 'further delays would have been unacceptable' in sending the convoy due to the humanitarian catastrophe in the conflict zone.

Last night the first the trucks had reached the war-ravaged region of Lugansk, greeted by posters reading: 'Mother Russia will not desert us in hard times.'

The Ukrainian secret service, SBU, alleged the convoy has a military purpose, while the Red Cross refused to accompany the lorries as had been planned, after it failed to receive security guarantees from the warring factions.

'This is a direct invasion,' claimed SBU chief Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, as rebel militias escorted the trucks.

The Ukrainian foreign ministry denounced a 'deliberate and aggressive' move from Moscow in 'flagrant violation' of international law.

'The fact that Russia's trucks entered Ukrainian territory without proper border and custom formalisation and that the cargo was not handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross bespeaks the premeditated and aggressive nature of the Russian party's actions,' it said a statement. 

'We call upon all international partners to unite in decisively condemning Russia's illegal and aggressive actions.'

Ukraine's prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was a dire risk that 'several of the trucks of this so-called convoy will be bombed' by pro-Russians but it would be staged to blame Ukraine.

A Kiev security official said that Moscow was 'exclusively responsible' for the security of the convoy as it travels across rebel-held territory.

Mr Nalyvaychenko warned that the drivers of the convoy would be redeployed to drive military vehicles already smuggled into Ukraine, and the 'aid' would benefit rebel fighters.

'In reality, a group of drivers enters to drive military vehicles which are illegally brought into our country every day via Izvaryne border check post and other checkpoints,' he said.

'There are individuals from prison escort and other units of the Russian Federation among the so-called drivers - for the purpose of kidnapping and covering up crimes.

'These lorries will be used to transport equipment and weapons. Terrorists catastrophically lack them after the successful action by our military.' 

With tensions high, Russia earlier expressed fury that Kiev had blocked the 270-vehicle convoy for more than week, stressing the lorries contained 2000 tons of aid including baby food and bottled water.

'We can no longer stand this outrage, these open-faced lies and [Kiev's] refusal to reach an agreement. Russia has decided to act', said the Russian foreign ministry.

By last night, Russian customs had allowed all the convoy's vehicles to pass its border post, but Ukrainian officials said they had inspected hardly any of the vehicles after being 'blocked'.

A spokesman Kiev's border guard service said: 'The trucks that underwent customs clearance have started moving on the territory of Ukraine while a group of Ukrainian border guards and customs officers was blocked in Russia's Donetsk checkpoint.'

The convoy 'started moving at 11.20am without being accompanied by ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] representatives and in breach of the existing agreements about customs clearance of the cargo'.

Kiev last night pledged not to attack the convoy with war planes but defence minister Valeriy Heletey vowed to revenge the act. 

'Let's wait a little bit, and the response will be appropriate', he said.

For the past week the lorries have been holed up next to a Russian military base close to the border, amid fears by Ukraine that some of the lorries contained military equipment.

The Red Cross said of the convoy: 'We are no way part of it.'

Ukraine this weekend marks its Independence Day with a parade in Kiev organised by boxer turned mayor Vitali Klitschko, who vowed that after the show of patriotism soldiers and tanks taking part would immediately head to rebel regions to fight.

But the country's economy is in dire straits due to the civil war in which 2,200 have so far died, as Yatsenyuk admitted.

'Can Ukraine now survive without Russian gas? No, it can't. How much Russian gas do we need to buy? About 5 billion cubic meters,' he said.

The Red Cross reported heavy shelling overnight in the rebel-held bastion of Lugansk where the Russian trucks were heading.

The Russian Red Cross said today it could help distribute the aid in Lugansk.

'We are ready to take part,' said a spokesman.

Ukrainian customs officers said they had completed customs clearance for just 34 of the lorries.

A burning effigy of Vladimir Putin was the main attraction at a children's festival in Ukraine.

In a clip posted on YouTube, the life-sized doll appears to be insulted by the host of the event before being set alight by several people.

Jeering children taking part in the summer holiday festival in Ivano-Frankovsk are then encouraged to join in  taunts, before the protesters - including young children - link hands and dance around the effigy. 

Witness Denis Petrov said: 'Feelings against Putin and Russia are running very high.' 

One internet user commented on the film: 'It is a pity it was only a doll. How to get to the original?'
