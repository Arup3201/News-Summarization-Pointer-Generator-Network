Concerns: There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe

A powerful statin carries a high rate of harmful side-effects including an increased risk of diabetes, a leading campaigner warns today.

There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe.

He is the founder and senior adviser to the US civil rights body Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, which attempted to get the drug banned ten years ago because of muscle and kidney problems.

Since then, evidence had continued to mount about the drug’s poor benefits, he claims. 

British experts have said statins are safe and effective, with protection against heart attacks outweighing possible side-effects.

One has reassured patients on rosuvastatin, saying they should continue taking it.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed group of drugs in the NHS and given to between eight and ten million adults. They include those with cardiac disease or at risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Initial approval of rosuvastatin to prevent heart attacks in a very select group of people was based on a study which was stopped early, says Dr Wolfe.

This led to concern that the effects may have been over-estimated, he adds in an editorial in The BMJ medical journal.

A review of trials showed that the drug, also known as Crestor, was linked to a 25 per cent extra risk of diabetes compared with a placebo, he says. 

Crestor was the most prescribed brand name drug in the US last year and accounts for around four per cent of NHS prescriptions for statins.

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Patients taking rosuvastatin should not stop taking it. They are on it for a very good reason.

‘This opinion piece raises more questions about pharmaceutical marketing and prescribing practices in the US than the safety and use of statins in general.

‘Rosuvastatin is more expensive than other statins and is one of the least commonly prescribed in the UK. 

'It is generally prescribed for a small number of people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke and who cannot tolerate the older statins or have not had the desired reduction in cholesterol levels on them.’

Dr Wolfe adds that worldwide 2013 sales of the medicine were £5.5billion, the third highest for any branded drug.

He accuses advertising campaigns of exploiting its potency despite ‘long-standing, continuing evidence of rosuvastatin’s comparative lack of clinical benefits and increasing evidence of risk’.

The drug’s patent expires in 2016 and he expresses hope this would lead to a sharp decline in its use. The NHS estimates statins save 7,000 lives a year. 

A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said: ‘They are safe and effective, and play an important role. People should continue to take their medicines as prescribed.’

A senior doctor took a statin for two years despite being at low risk and developed crippling muscle pain.

But Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, did not make any link at first.

Hospital tests, X-rays and an MRI scan all came back clear.

He said: ‘I thought it was worth seeing what would happen if I stopped taking the drug. Within two to three weeks, my back and legs began to feel a lot better and my sleep improved.

‘Statins have an important role for patients who already have heart disease. But we must take much more care about prescribing them to low-risk patients. I was healthy and I became unhealthy.’

London cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra said the side-effects of statins have been downplayed.

‘To think that taking a drug that drastically reduces one’s cholesterol will have no other potential adverse effect is not just lazy medicine, it’s bad science,’ he added.
