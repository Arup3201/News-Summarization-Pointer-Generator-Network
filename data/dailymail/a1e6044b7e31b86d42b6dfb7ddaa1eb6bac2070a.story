Cash-strapped surgeons in Moldova are using DIY tools for operations because they have no funds to buy proper medical equipment.

Doctors have been forced to carry out complex operations on children using drills, pliers and electrical saws usually reserved for home renovations.

Staff at the Ignatenco Children's Hospital leaked a video to the country's Panorama newspaper showing three masked surgeons and a nurse wield what looks like a household drill to bore a hole in a sedated patient’s elbow.

They also use what appears to be a pair of pliers to hold extracted tissue and remove the drill from the hole.

Staff at the hospital, in Moldova's capital Chisinau, said they were upset the hospital's director had not allocated money for new equipment.

Nicolae Curca, one of the surgeons who performed the operation, said: 'Household tools have only one drawback – they are difficult to sterilize.'

Dr Curca said that his colleagues also use hammers and chisels to break through bone.

Europe’s poorest nation, Moldova has witnessed a deterioration of the population’s health status in all indicators since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, according to the World Health Organization.

The video has provoked outrage in Moldova, causing Prime Minister Iurie Leanca to call for an inspection of the hospital, its inventory and medical staff.

Moldova’s Health Minister Andrei Usatii was quoted as having told a TV channel that medical equipment is available and used for operations at the hospital, and that the clinic has three new medical drills.

'The electric drill shown in the video is something else. Such tools are not listed in the clinic’s inventory, but they can be used,' he said.

Heavy duty: The DIY tools are bulky and impractical for surgery, as well as being hard to keep sterile

Anger: The footage has caused uproar in Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries
