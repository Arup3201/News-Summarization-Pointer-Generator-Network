A disabled mother has been fined £120 for taking her youngest child out of primary school during term time. 

The mother-of-four, who wishes to remain anonymous, suffered a stroke after paying the charge, according to campaign group Parents Want a Say.

The woman's three oldest children were given permission to go on vacation by their secondary school, but her youngest child was not allowed. 

Despite this, the family went ahead with the holiday, as it was funded by a charity, who could only afford term-time holidays. 

The mother was slapped with the charge when she returned from the trip.

Since the rules, heads have turned down requests for children to skip school for term-time holidays, as well as refusing applications for pupils to attend relatives' weddings, funerals and even leave on doctor's advice

Changes to the law, which came into force on September 1, mean schools no longer have the discretion to grant 10 days of authorised leave to pupils each year.

Instead, headteachers are being told they should only approve an absence under 'exceptional circumstances'.

The new rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education.

In the year before the new legislation was introduced, the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent in the past year.

Some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months.

The new legislation, brought in on September 1, aims to prevent youngsters missing chunks of their education 

The move has been criticised by campaigners who claim it is unfair on parents and has no affect on the level of a child's academic achievement.

Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, which has collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who oppose the new rules.

He told MailOnline: 'The government's own research says that a small amount of authorised holidays has no negative affect on achievement and may in fact result in better outcomes. 

'The time that parents have to concentrate on their children means that if they do ensure that work is put into academic issues then it can be better for the children. 

'The only benefit to be expected from the new policy is for Ofsteds statistics on absence to look different. We should concentrate on what is best for the children rather than ticking Ofsted's boxes.'

He added: 'There are many cases where families are badly impacted by the new rules.  Families should be supported by the government rather than family life made more difficult.'

Mr Hemming said he would raise the case of the disabled mother with Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary.

A spokesman for the local authority that imposed the penalty charge, said it could not comment on individual cases, but added: 'Cases such as this create difficult decisions for head teachers, particularly in the light of changes introduced by national government at the beginning of this year, which dramatically restrict their ability to exercise discretion.

'If absence is not authorised and parents still take their children out of school then the local authority is obliged to issue a penalty notice.'

In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days.

Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer. 

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.

The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups.

Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

She was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine, but was cleared of a criminal act.

In another case taken up by the campaign group, a five-year-old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad.

Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September. 

Craig Stephenson, a police officer, can only take leave only at authorised times. Because of his work commitments he was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went.

'Now we are left in limbo wondering whether we will be fined,' said Pauline Stephenson. 'It is not something we would normally do but we took books for her and the trip was educational. We went into Paris and Lauren learnt French words.

'I feel annoyed because we are good parents and we take school very seriously. This is the only family holiday we have ever had abroad.'

In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the US to attend a family memorial service.

He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term. 

But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the US. 

Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays. 

Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work.

He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine. 

But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission.
