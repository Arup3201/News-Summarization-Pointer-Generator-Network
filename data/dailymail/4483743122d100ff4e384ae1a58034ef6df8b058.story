The Sydney man who rose to social media fame after mocking people's strange Tinder photos has met up with one of his female subjects for the first time after the photo went viral across the world.

Instead of using Tinder to find a potential date, Jarrod Allen, 25, uses it as inspiration to painstakingly recreate weird and wonderful profile photos.

One such photo belonged to 26-year-old Sophie Nelson who was captured in a yoga pose drinking red wine from a glass held in between her toes.

Mr Allen's hilarious impersonation of the photo ended up on his Tindafella blog and Instagram and was eventually shared by Hollywood star Ashton Kutcher.

The pose now even has its own hashtag - #redwinefootchallenge.

A mutual friend brought the pair together on Wednesday night at Ms Nelson's home in Manly, north of Sydney, where they recreated the now-famous photo side by side.

Ms Nelson was able to gracefully sip from the glass, but Mr Allen's attempt was a little less sophisticated with the Sydney electrician spilling red wine all over his beard and shirt.

'I was really bad at it. It's probably one of the hardest I've done because I'm not flexible,' Mr Allen told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Allan has fended off hundreds of marriage proposals since news of Tindafella went viral but he boasts he is still single.

'I ran in to Sophie's roommate last week and she invited me around for a wine and cheese night, so I decided to pop around.

'There was like 12 of us there, it definitely wasn't a date with Sophie.'

Ms Nelson joked about having to fend off other woman interested in Mr Allan but brushed off any suggestion of a potential romance in an interview with news.com.au.

'... Jarrod was great, he greeted me with a pot plant that he picked up from my front yard. He’s so big,' she said.

'I’ll have to fend off the hundreds of girls sending him marriage proposals - that bearded man is in high demand at the moment.

'It was such a funny night.'

Since news of the Tindafella blog went viral last month, Mr Allen has been back impersonating weird and wonderful profile pictures

His blog and Instagram accounts have drawn in more than 60,000 followers in two weeks

The Tindafella blog started three months ago when Mr Allen found a girl's profile who had 'really dark, thick eyebrows'.

'I was sitting in my mate's work truck and I started flicking through Tinder and I saw that photo,' he said.

'I had duct tape in my pocket because I'm an electrician so I whacked it on and sent it around to a couple of the boys.

'It got a pretty good reaction so I kept doing it.'

Mr Allen's absolute favourite is a shot of a bikini-clad girl having water poured on her, which he turned around and recreated with milk

He insists his blog is just a bit of fun and says he's only been asked by one girl to remove the photo.

'I don't care if they've seen them but a few of them have and have laughed. I (recreated) a photo of Tully from Big Brother and I ran into her at Splendour in the Grass and she was pretty stoked.

'I've got a phone full of stupid (profile) photos. There's stacks out there.

Mr Allen is an ambassador for the charity Beard Season, which encourages people to get their skin checked.
