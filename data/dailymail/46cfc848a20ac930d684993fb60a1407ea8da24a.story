John Chen Lui Lu infected patients with deadly bacteria during heart surgery between December 2008 and July 2010, because he 'constantly changed his gloves mid-operation'

A heart surgeon who infected at least 11 patients with a bug that killed five of them is seeking to keep his past a secret when he returns to the operating theatre.

John Chen Lui Lu has been banned from performing operations since the deaths in 2009 and 2010 were triggered when he passed on the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis to patients receiving artificial heart valves.

The bacteria lives on the skin of most people but can be deadly if it enters the bloodstream of those with surgical implants or weak immune systems, and was allegedly passed on due to Mr Lu’s habit of changing gloves mid-operation.

Although the surgeon was allowed to continue his work as a consultant in the cardiac department at Nottingham’s City Hospital, he is being allowed to return to the operating theatre only if he is open about his background with future patients.

But in what has been described as an unprecedented case, the surgeon is taking Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust to the High Court after he refused to accept its order.

Mr Lu does not believe it is necessary to disclose the deaths, and the hearing next month will centre on the ‘level of information’ patients should receive about his background before he operates on them.

His solicitors are expected to argue that telling patients about his past will be a restriction of trade, while the Trust will say that patient safety would be compromised.

As well as the five patients who died, Mr Lu infected six others who survived. Alan Daniels (left) and Michael Smithers (right) both died after being infected with staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria while Mr Lu operated

Lawyers for the families of the five 
men who died told an inquest in 2010 that Mr Lu’s habit of changing 
gloves during surgery had caused the bacteria to be passed on.

The
 hearing was told that of 28 patients who had valves inserted by the 
surgeon at City Hospital’s Trent Cardiac Centre in 2009 and 2010, 11 
fell ill.

On Thursday, the 
trust sent a  letter to all patients and relatives affected by the 
outbreak, informing them of the legal wrangle.

In
 it, bosses said they were ‘committed’ to bringing Mr Lu back to 
surgery, but only if patients receive ‘appropriate information’ about 
his history. Yesterday, Denise Edwards, whose 82 year-old father Dennis 
Mills was one of those who died, told of her shock when she read the 
letter about the possibility of Mr Lu returning to surgery.

‘I
 lived through the trauma and distress of seeing my father, who was a 
fit and active man before having his surgery, slowly deteriorating and 
eventually dying as a result of the infection.’

A
 hospital spokesman said: ‘We remain committed to Mr Lu’s return ... but
 we are determined that patients will receive appropriate information as
 they consider having surgery at our hospital.’

Mr Lu’s solicitors have not commented.

David Tyson, 68, contracted the infection after undergoing a heart valve replacement at Nottingham City Hospital in June 2009. He said: 'The situation that happened should never be allowed to happen again'
