Ashamed: Experienced acupuncturist Dr Jeff Tsing of Hwa Tow Acupuncture said he is embarrassed that he forgot a patient

An acupuncture patient was forced to call police and pull out the needles herself after the clinician went home mid-treatment, leaving her locked inside a Texas center.

The woman called 911 after she suddenly saw  acupuncturist Dr Jeff Tsing, who claims to have 20 years experience, leave Arlington's Hwa Tow Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs Clinic while the pins were still stuck in her skin on August 5.

But the bizarre lapse didn't just stun the woman - both the licensed acupuncture practitioner and 911 operator were equally as confused.

After calling out for help for about five minutes as she lay on the treatment table, the disoriented woman called police.

'Yes, I'm locked in someone's business 
establishment,' the woman, who refused to be identified, said. 

'I don’t hear anybody. The music went 
off. The door is locked and his car is gone.'

According to the phone recording, published by wfaa.com, the operator then asked if the woman was a patient.

'Yes.
I was in the middle of a treatment. All of the sudden, I saw him 
running out for someone to come. I ended up pulling the needles out,' 
she responded.

'I had 
to pull the needles out of me in order to, you know, find out what's 
going on. I'm yelling for help for about five minutes or so.'

This is the clinic in which an acupuncture patient was locked during a treatment

Even the 911 operator seemed stunned, saying: 'Oh, my goodness.'

The caller stayed on the line for about 10 minutes. A worker at a separate office in the building let her out when police arrived.

Dr. Jeff Tsing and his wife are reportedly the only two employees at the clinic.

Tsing told wfaa.com off camera he was ashamed and still baffled by how he forgot his own patient.

According to the company website, HWATOW 
Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medical Clinic was established in 
1991 in Dallas by Jeff and Jason Tsing.

However board documents indicate Tsing was licensed in 1994, but does not have a history of disciplinary action against him, according to wfaa.com.

The website also says Jeff Tsing has practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine for over 20 years and was one of the first 150 acupuncturists in Texas.

He served as Clinical Director of the Texas College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Austin from 1993 to 1997, teaching the next generation of clinicians the alternative craft.

Dr Jeff Tsing was reportedly mortified when confronted by a journalist about abandoning a patient mid-treatment
