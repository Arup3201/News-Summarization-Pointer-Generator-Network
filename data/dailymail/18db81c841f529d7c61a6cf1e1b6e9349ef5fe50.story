The President of Liberia apologized to the Mayor of Dallas, saying she felt 'responsibility' for Ebola spreading from Africa to the United States.

Ellen Johnson Sirlead, president of the nation hardest-hit by Ebola, called Mike Rawlings to express regret that the killer virus had crossed the Atlantic.

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian citizen, brought Ebola to America in late September when he flew from the capital of Monrovia to Dallas.

He was taken in to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where he died after infecting at least two nurses, who are being treated in secure facilities.

Rawlings revealed the exchange in a group call with faith leaders about the Ebola crisis, which was then reported by the Guardian.

Rex Howe, pastor for a Dallas church, spoke about the conversation. He said: 'The mayor said that there was a call to him personally, and that the Liberian president had mentioned apologies, and, in his words, a little bit of responsibility that this was even happening.'

Another participant said that Rawlings had declined the apology, saying that it was a problem for the global community. He also expressed hope that Dallas's experiences with Ebola could help fight the disease in West Africa.

Duncan died of Ebola in Texas Health Presbyterian on October 8. It later emerged that two nurses - Nina Pham and Amber Vinson - had been infected while caring for him.

Pham, 26, was named as the first person to contract Ebola on Monday. Her condition today deteriorated from 'good' to 'fair'.

She was originally being treated in Dallas, but was moved to the National Institutes of Health in Maryland for specialist care.

Vinson, 29, emerged as another Ebola victim this Tuesday. She is now being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Liberian embassy in Washington would not comment on the call, and Rawlings' representatives could not be reached.
