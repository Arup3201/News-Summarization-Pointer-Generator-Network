Victim: 26-year-old Jamie McMahon was killed in an unprovoked attack as he sat on a bench in a churchyard in Northampton last October

Two thugs have been jailed for life after battering a man to death in a vicious attack that was so frenzied they left a footprint on his face.

Mark Lewis, 20, and Michael Francis, 33, were 'on a mission to steal and rob' on the night they targetted Jamie McMahon, 26, in an mindless attack last October, the court heard.

The two men stole just £30 from their victim, who they left bloodied and bruised in a churchyard in Northampton after beating him to death.

Mr McMahon had enjoyed a night playing snooker with friends on when he stopped for something to eat on the way home.

He sat down to eat his kebab on a bench outside St Giles' Church, in Northampton, when he was approached by his killers shortly after 2am.

A court heard Mr McMahon was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' after being violently attacked by the pair who were 'on a mission to steal and rob'.

They beat up and kicked the snooker hall worker in the head so brutally that they fractured his eye socket and left a trainer imprint on his face.

The pair then took the victim's wallet, which contained £20, and his iPhone which they sold for £10.

They spent some of the stolen money on tobacco, soft drinks, jam sandwiches, crisps, milk and sugar shortly after the vicious attack.

On Friday the pair were given a combined sentence of 46 years at Northampton Crown Court.

Francis, who was found guilty of murder and robbery, will serve a minimum of 26 years in prison.

Lewis, who admitted the same charges, was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 20 years and eight months.

Sentencing Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'Mr McMahon was subject to a sustained attack. He was a popular man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'You carried no weapon but you knew where vulnerable people would be and you were prepared to use severe violence.

'No sentence will bring him back and he will be sorely missed by his family and friends. He did nothing to deserve what happened to him.

'The spontaneous attack was vicious, rapid and mindless.'

The court heard that Francis claimed Lewis had threatened him to keep quiet but Judge Mayo said it was 'inconceivable'.

He said Francis was not 'in awe or fear of Lewis,' because of his actions in helping to conceal any evidence after the attack, including swapping clothing with his friend.

During the trial, which finished on July 10, the court heard that Jamie had been sitting on a bench in the churchyard when he was attacked.

A pathologist had concluded that the head injuries would have left him unconscious and he would have died within an hour of the attack.

CCTV cameras tracked the thugs on their walk home as they stopped at a BP garage.

Representing Francis, Jonas Harkin told the court that Lewis was the only one proven to have kicked and stamped on the victim.

But Judge Mayo said he believed Francis became directly involved in the violent attack.

Amjad Malis, defending Lewis, said his client had 'exploded into violence', which was linked to suffering a childhood of abuse at the hands of his grandmother, who was his main carer after his father committed suicide.

He also said that Lewis had been involved in two previous violent robberies. A psychologist's report said he is a person likely to respond disproportionately to confrontation.

Lewis was also given five concurrent years for robbery and Francis was given eight years for the same charge.

After the case Detective Inspector Louise Hemingway, from Northamptonshire Police, said she hoped the sentences handed down would help the family come to terms with their loss.She said: 'We are pleased with the significant jail terms handed down to Lewis and Francis today.

'They are both extremely dangerous individuals who targeted a young man who was on his way home from an evening out with friends for no other reason than to steal from him.

'Hopefully these lengthy prison sentences will provide some closure to Jamie's family who have been left heartbroken by this senseless murder.'
