With the most instinctive extension of his leg at the far post last night, Miroslav Klose moved one step closer to immortality.

This is how the really great goal scorers do it; without fuss. It’s their job and to people like Klose it comes naturally.

In scoring the 15th goal of his remarkable World Cup career, the German centre forward – on as a second half substitute – edged level with the Brazilian Ronaldo at the top of the all-time table. Perhaps just as importantly to him, he moved ahead of his compatriot, the great Gerd Mueller.

But, most importantly of all, Klose saved his team and his nation last night.

Reeling from a stunning Ghana assault midway through the second half, Germany were trailing 2-1 in Fortaleza. For a few moments they looked as though they would join Italy, England and Spain in the World Cup hall of shame.

Important players do important things, though, and when the big German defender Bendikt Howedes rose to flick on a corner 19 minutes from time, Klose was in the right place to earn his team a point.

In recent times, Klose has replaced the somersault that used to follow his big goals with a simple pump of the fist. Last night, though, the acrobatics were back.

'I don't know how long it’s been since I did a somersault. but at least it worked out,' he smiled afterwards.

Klose now has 70 international goals to his name from 133 games. It is a remarkable record and he had been tied with Mueller in the World Cup list since he scored twice in a 4-0 quarter-final win over Argentina four years ago in Cape Town.

These days, of course, he is not first choice. Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller is the modern go-to man and Klose perhaps arrived in Brazil not expecting to see much action. This was his first appearance of the tournament and his goal came from pretty much his first touch.

Germany needed it, too, as another night of gripping, unexpected drama threatened to provide us with one more upset. How odd that was, too, as Germany did look as though they were going to coast to the top of the group with maximum points after shading the first half and then taking the lead.

The German midfield functioned brilliantly at times in the opening period with Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil imposing himself on the tournament for the first time after a quiet game against Portugal and Toni Kroos looking the measured, astute passing footballer we know him to be.

There were chances for the Germans during this time but they couldn’t take them. 

They almost scored a super goal in the eleventh minute as a Muller back heel gave Kroos the chance to shot. The ball may have found the corner, too, had it not struck a defender’s shin.

Kroos and Ozil were combining very well as the half progressed and the two of them created an opening for Sami Khedira in the 18th minute only for the goalkeeper to save. Ozil then crossed low from the right for Muller who was denied by a tackle from John Boye.

Momentum was certainly building for Germany but for a while they couldn’t break through. Kroos shot over from distance and then Ozil chipped a pass through for Mario Goetze, whose volley found the goalkeeper’s midriff.

Goetze was eventually to score the opening goal but he had to wait until the 51st minute to do it. A cross from Muller deep on the right found the Bayern Munich player squeezing in between defenders and his header ended up in the net off his own right knee.

In the lead at last, Germany looked set to consolidate as they often do. It didn’t happen, though, and three minutes later Ghana caught them cold with an equaliser before taking the lead and turning the whole night on its head.

Again the cross came from the right for the equaliser and it was Andre Ayew who climbed above the static Shkodran Mustafi to head powerfully to Manuel Neuer’s right and in to the corner.

For Germany to concede one goal was careless but for them to concede again a few minutes later was criminal. This time they were architects of their own downfall as they gave the ball away in midfield and watched the superb Asamoah Gyan race away and score powerfully with his right foot.

With Ghana energised and full of adrenaline now, Germany all of a sudden looked a different team and the Africans poured forward.

Had the irrepressible Gyan found the corner instead of Neuer’s midriff after flying down the left in the 66th minute then the game could have been over.  

As it was, Klose and Sebastien Schweinsteiger were sent on immediately and after the former scored the latter ambled forwards to head another chance over.

In to the final stages and Germany could have won it. The breaking Muller was tackled brilliantly by Kwadwo Asamoah and then – two minutes in to added time – Klose spurned the chance to make history.

With three weeks of this tournament to run, you wouldn’t bet against it happening would you?
