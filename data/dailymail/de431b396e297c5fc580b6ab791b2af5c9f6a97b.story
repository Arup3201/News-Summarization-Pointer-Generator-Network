Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard blasted Liverpool for being 'too soft' as their Champions League hopes were plunged into jeopardy.

Liverpool were beaten 1-0 by Basle, conceding a poor goal to Marco Streller, and the feeble manner of their performance in St Jakob Park enraged their manager and captain.

To add to a miserable night, there was an open show of petulance from Mario Balotelli, who ignored Rodgers’ request to applaud the visiting supporters and stormed straight down the tunnel.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admitted his side were second best in Basle

It was the manner in which they surrendered control of Group B, though, that caused Rodgers and Gerrard most alarm and they slammed the way in which Liverpool, who now face back-to-back games against reigning champions Real Madrid, folded.

Gerrard said: 'They wanted it more which is most disappointing. We came for the win and I expected a win so very disappointing. We didn't deserve anything. We were too soft all over the pitch.

‘It hurts to say they wanted it more. We were second best against an ok team. We didn’t show what we did against Everton. We went back to how we have been this season, which wasn’t good enough.’

Rodgers agreed, saying: ‘It was far too soft – and not for the first time either. We lost contact again (for the goal) and it was a very disappointing one to concede after all the work we’ve done on the training ground.

‘We never not going in the first 25 minutes and gave it away too easy. We grew into it and I thought we created some chances. We were close on couple of occasions but we conceded a soft goal and then it’s difficult.

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli endured a frustrating night in Basle on Wednesday

Balotelli had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled out for offside

Balotelli was also booked for an off-the-ball 'slap' on Basle's Taulant Xhaka

‘Away from home, against a team with a great record, we had a chance to at least get a point. I don’t think we’re anywhere near where we were technically last year. It’s very important we get back to playing as a team because that’s what we have done over the last 18 months.’

This is the second time Balotelli has ignored Rodgers order to clap the travelling fans but the Northern Irishman attempted to defuse the situation.

‘Mario worked hard, he knows his job is to create and to get into the area,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are working hard on it. I’m not sure if he went back out to say thanks to the fans as I came straight in.’
