Sepp Blatter has launched an astonishing attack on the British media, claiming the allegations of corruption around the Qatar World Cup bid are being driven by ‘racism and discrimination’.

The FIFA president also claimed there is a plot ‘to destroy FIFA’, although his mandarins moved swiftly here to insist that remark was not targeted at the British.

The 78-year-old president’s remarks came as more of FIFA’s leading sponsors joined the call for an investigation into allegations that Qatar bought the 2022 World Cup with millions of dollars-worth of bribes — administered by disgraced FIFA vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam.

On the attack: Blatter hit back at his critics, particularly those in the English media

Election time: The FIFA President spoke to the South American association hoping to raise support

Blatter said: ‘Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup. Sadly there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me. It really makes me sad.’

He referred to the scandal as ‘Qatargate’ before adding that FIFA need to combat ‘anything that smacks of discrimination and racism’. Blatter then spoke to the Asian congress (AFC) and essentially repeated the claim, with a more specific reference to the British press.

‘We have seen what the British press has published,’ he said. ‘I don’t know what the reasoning is behind this but we must maintain unity.

‘We are in the situation where we need leadership. I still have fire inside me and if we show unity that is the best way to deal with those in the world that want to destroy FIFA. They want to destroy us.

‘They don’t want to destroy football but they want to destroy the institution (FIFA). Because our institution is too strong and is so strong, we are sure they will not destroy it.’

Corruption claims: Blatter has come under fire over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar

Making friends: the FIFA President promised to reward African associations with bigger bonuses

Seeking votes: Blatter is hoping to be re-elected for a fifth term as President of FIFA after the World Cup

Blatter’s agenda was obvious. As he looks to gain re-election next year, this was a surefire way to secure more support across two continents.

At a meeting with the African congress he was told he could stand for 10 elections and be confident of their support. Blatter told them bonuses to African member associations from World Cup profits would be increased.

‘It’s for you, for us, for everyone,’ he said. To the Asian congress he said something similar. ‘I will give bonuses to you — actually two,’ he said. ‘The confederations also deserve it. I’m sure you will be very happy with it.’

FIFA are set to rake in £2.6billion from this World Cup and Blatter’s promise of bigger bonuses is likely to follow a pattern set in 2010.

At that time Blatter pledged FIFA members would each get a £150,000 bonus from the South Africa tournament while confederations would get £1.5m. FIFA pledged a further £180,000 in January 2011 and four months later Blatter was re-elected unopposed. 

Blatter 
also raised the issue of the two controversial reforms that will go 
before the FIFA Congress this week — votes on term and age limits for 
the FIFA president and executive committee members.

Restating
 his stance that age limits for sports administrators ‘is a form of 
discrimination’, Blatter then appealed for African delegates to support 
his bid for another term, having first been elected in 1998.

Global support: The Asian and African federations gave Blatter a rousing ovation, but UEFA may not

Unrest: In the same city as Blatter's speeches subway workers were demonstrating, causing disruption

It is African delegates who are alleged to have received payments from Bin Hammam. Blatter received huge applause and a standing ovation following his speech on Monday.

Blatter is understood to have employed a similar tack before the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were made in Zurich.

Reports by the BBC and The Sunday Times had hinted at possible corruption around the bidding process and it is believed Blatter urged executive committee members to remember the British media before casting their votes. England’s 2018 bid received just one external vote.

Blatter will meet with Uefa today, but he is unlikely to receive the same warm reception from European football’s governing body.

The pressure intensified on Blatter and his organisation yesterday, as yet more major sponsors called for action over the Sunday Times reports.

On Sunday four of the six main FIFA sponsors — Sony, Visa, adidas and Coca-Cola — expressed their concern over the allegations. Yesterday a fifth, the Korean car giant Hyundai, released a statement.

It said: ‘We are confident that Fifa is taking these allegations seriously and the investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee will conduct a thorough investigation.’

Presence: Armed riot police were called in to deal with the strikers, who could disrupt Thursday's opener

Clashes: Train operators clashed with the police as the strike showed no sign of ending soon

World Cup sponsors Castrol and Budweiser also issued statements.

With the start of the World Cup two days away, this storm raged against the backdrop of yet more civil disturbance and a metro strike.

On Monday morning, Brazilian riot police used tear gas against around 300 protesters in Sao Paulo.

The protest was called by metro workers who are striking in support of a wage increase.

If the strike is still running on Thursday, it could severely  disrupt the opening encounter between hosts Brazil and Croatia. Traffic in much of the city has come to a standstill, with FIFA officials subjected to four-hour car journeys from the airport to their hotel on Monday.
