Video footage of a frail-looking Nelson Mandela surrounded by the South African President and other officials during a photo opportunity has provoked a storm of outrage.

The footage was released yesterday and shows the respected former president sat in a chair at his home in Johannesburg.

It was the first footage of the 94-year-old since he left hospital on April 6 after suffering from pneumonia.

As leaders from the governing African 
National Congress arrange themselves around Mandela for a photo 
opportunity, an unamused looking Mandela barely moves and never smiles.

Keeping positive: South African president Jacob Zuma (left) said he was 'really happy' with Mandela's progress. However, this footage caused a storm of outrage in South Africa

Icon: Mandela was South Africa's first black president and is seen by many as the father of the nation

Motionless: Mandela sat up in an armchair with the aid of a cushion, but appeared not to interact with the people around him

The stunt has caused anger in South Africa where many have accused the government of parading the anti-apartheid hero on TV for political gain.

As reported by CNN, Twitter user Brent Lindeque wrote: 'After everything Madiba 
has done for us this is how they treat him. Like an animal at the zoo. 
Shame on the ANC!'

A radio station in Johannesburg added: 'The way #Madiba was paraded on SABC TV this evening was horrible! Grotesque 'journalism'. All involved should hang their heads in shame!'

During the photo opportunity, South African president Jacob Zuma said Mandela was 'in good shape' and 'good spirits'

The ANC today rejected criticism of the photograph opportunity.

On the mend: The former president is being cared for by a large team of medical experts

Back home: Mandela spent 10 days in hospital earlier this month after coming down with pneumonia

Party spokesman Jackson Mthembu 
said the party also stands by its statements that Mandela is in good health and good spirits.

He added: 'South Africans are called upon to appreciate that Tata is 94 years old;
he will thus be frail and not as active and energetic as we all fondly 
remember him.

'There is no reason to be alarmed by the visuals of an 
elderly person who clearly is receiving the necessary care and 
attention.'

Mandela spent 10 days in hospital 
being treated for the illness, which followed an earlier hospitalisation
in December when he developed a lung infection and gallstones.

The video shows Mandela sitting
upright in an armchair, surrounded by friends, family, politicians and 
medical staff at his home in Johannesburg.

It is the first public image of him since Hillary Clinton visited in her role as US secretary of state in August.

'Good spirits': Zuma told SABC News that Mandela was 'really up and about' and in 'good shape'

Mandela
- also known as Madiba in South Africa - appears to be virtually 
expressionless and does not seem to react to those around him.

He is wearing a flamboyant black and white shirt, with a white blanket covering his legs.

He looks thinner than usual and pale, with marks on his cheeks that appear to be from a recently removed oxygen mask.

But President Zuma insisted he was doing well.

Speaking on the doorstep of Mandela's home, he told SABC News: 'The doctors gave us a report and of 
course we saw him. He is looking very good, he is in good shape. We had 
some conversation with him, we shook hands, we smiled.

'As you can see he
is really up and about and stablised. We're really very happy. We think that 
he is fine.'

In the video, Zuma jokes and laughs with two officials of the governing African National Congress, some Mandela family members and the former president's medical team, while Mandela stares straight ahead.

One of his grandsons cries 'Smile, smile,' as he takes a picture on his mobile phone. He attempts a weak smile but, as the flash goes off, he closes his eyes and purses his lips.

The former president is known to dislike camera flashes, as his eyes are sensitive after years of working in the glare of a limestone quarry when he was imprisoned on Robben Island.

In a statement, the ANC said Mandela was 'keenly 
aware of the goodwill that has been outpouring from the peoples of the 
globe as befitting his status as our icon'.

The Nobel Peace laureate was imprisoned for 27 years during the apartheid era became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994.
