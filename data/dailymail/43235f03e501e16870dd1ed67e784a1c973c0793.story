Many people are eager to embrace Google Glass and other wearable gadgets to make digital data including maps and emails more accessible when on the move.

And now one company in San Francisco has developed a smart motorcycle helmet that will show maps and realtime views of blind spots on the wearer’s visor.

The first version of the Skully P-1 helmet is set to be released this summer and will also read text messages for riders so they can concentrate on the road ahead.

Camera: 180 degree wide angle rear view

Battery life: 9 hours

Material: Lightweight, aerodynamic shell

Safety approval: DOT and ECE certified

Price: Not released

Availability: People can apply to test a Beta version of the helmet, which is expected to be ready this summer

The P-1 claims to be the first motorbike helmet with a digital heads-up display built in, which is positioned outside a rider’s primary field of view.

The firm said the helmet will provide riders with an ‘advanced situational awareness system, showing navigation and blind spot data, allowing you to stay focused on the most important part of your ride - the road.’

A screen measuring one inch across is situated on the right-hand side of the helmet visor – and the rider’s field of view – and can show a turn-by-turn map to give people directions, without them having to take their eyes off the road.

On-board map storage plus Bluetooth enabled updates mean that the GPS system will work in remote areas without phone signal.

The screen can also display a live feed from a 180-degree rear view camera, to get rid of dangerous blind spots and show a rider if someone is driving dangerously closely behind.

Skully claims the rear-view camera system will give riders ‘complete situational awareness’.

Users will be able to connect their helmet to a smartphone via Bluetooth to let the smart helmet read back text messages so that they will not be distracted by trying to grapple with a handset on the road.

Once connected, a smartphone will be controlled by voice instructions so that the volume of music can be adjusted and calls made completely hands-free.

The helmet itself is made from a lightweight material and has an aerodynamic shape.

As well as boasting an HUD display, the visor will have an anti-fog, scratch and glare coating. It will also have a battery built in to allow for nine hours of use and will be able to be recharged using a Micro USB cable.

The cost of the P-1 helmet will be released once the beta testing programme begins this summer and testers can apply via the company’s Facebook page.

Skully plans to release an open source software development kit at the same time, to allow people to build their own apps to work with the helmet.
