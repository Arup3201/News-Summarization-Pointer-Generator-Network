One of the schoolgirl sisters who fled Britain to join ISIS and marry warlords has admitted she is proud to be known as a 'Terror Twin' and 'loves' living in Syria.

Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, ran away from their family in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago for 'paradise' in the war torn Middle East.

They have vowed never to return home after following their brother to Syria and social media updates suggest the pair are training to use grenades and Kalashnikov rifles.

Extremists: Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, have vowed to use their skills for ISIS and are revelling in the fame of being called the 'Terror Twins'

One of them, who has taken the name Umm Ja'far, has tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, including several revealing she still plans to be a doctor - but only so she can treat ISIS fighters.

In her latest exchange online she told The Sun: 'I love the name Terror Twin because it makes me sound scary. Isis love it when they make us sound scary because it makes us a big threat so I love it.

She added: 'I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It's self defence.'

The twins are now believed to be based in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold - where they are said to have already married fighters.  

The sisters were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors.

One recent tweet from their account said: 'Training to be doctors to Training to be killers... I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans'.

The pair left Manchester after sneaking from their bedrooms in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border into Syria.

Police said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who also ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror group around a year ago.

Friends said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training for battle.  

The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing.

A former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’.

Last month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’
