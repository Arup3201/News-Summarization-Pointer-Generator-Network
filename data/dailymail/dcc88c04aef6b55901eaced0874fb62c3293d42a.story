It was anything but a welcome return to work for thousands of Sydneysiders on Monday, with road closures in the city centre delaying the trip in for up to three hours in some cases.

The working year was off a slow start for many unsuspecting employees, who were unaware that roadworks were continuing in the Sydney CBD, leading to serious delays for city-bound buses travelling over the Harbour Bridge.

Some reported 90 minute delays, others taking to social media to suggest their travel time blew out to three hours.

On a bridge to nowhere! Traffic on Sydney's iconic bridge came to a standstill on Monday as work crews continued construction on a light rail project, closing off George Street in the heart of the city to all traffic

All modes of transport were diverted away from the CBD because of the construction work, all in peak hour

All roads into the city were turned into parking lots as unsuspecting commuters, returning to work after the holiday period were caught out by major construction along George Street

It wasn't just commuters over the Sydney Harbour Bridge experiencing a frustrating start to the working year as city-bound buses from southern and western parts of the city also forced to divert.

Bus lanes were clogged as roadwork in the CBD forces buses that normally use George Street were forced to take other routes.

It was a tale of woe as Sydney's traffic problems worsened on Monday, firstly by a truck breakdown in the Harbour Tunnel, then a motorcycle breakdown in Milson's Point and a two-car accident on the Warringah Freeway approaching the bridge.

Delays will continue throughout the first working week in the harbour city, transport officials have warned

Some commuters have vented their anger on social media, telling of a three-hour trip into work on Monday

And, it is not going to change any time soon, according to transport officials, who have advised commuters and motorists to allow extra travel time to the CBD all week, with several road closures scheduled. 

The $45 million project will see major construction through the CBD, to link the South East Light Rail with Circular Quay and Central, the Moore Park sporting and entertainment precinct including the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium. It will also take in Randwick Racecourse, the University of NSW and Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick.

The project includes the development of a pedestrian zone along George Street, between Hunter and Bathurst Streets. The full service is expected to be operational by 2020.
