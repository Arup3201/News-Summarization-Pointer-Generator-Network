David Cameron has been condemned for flying out of the country on a week's family holiday as Britain faced its biggest terror crisis since the 7/7 bombings in 2005.

MPs are said to be outraged as it emerged the Prime Minister has taken a 'few days break' over the Bank Holiday on the Spanish island of Ibiza.

But Downing Street hit back at the criticism today and said he 'remains in charge' despite being abroad.

It comes as a Conservative backbencher today warned that the Prime Minister may only have a year to save his job.

Mr Cameron went on a mid-morning flight yesterday with his wife Samantha and their children Nancy, Elwen and Florence.

MP for Bury St Edmunds, David Ruffley said today the Prime Minister has to win the argument on the EU in the coming year or UKIP will split the Tory vote at the European Elections in 12 months.

'I think next May’s euro elections might put pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of speculation in and around Downing Street, so I am led to believe, that UKIP might come first, ' he said.

'Now if that happens next May there’ll be 12 months before the election and some of our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy.

'I don’t think UKIP are going to win seats but they could split the Conservative vote if they are very strong and let Labour through in those marginal seats.

'But I think David Cameron has got 12 months to show that his strategy works.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said today that his party is 'in talks all over the place' with Tory politicans keen to join him, with 'around 20' Eurosceptic MPs willing to stand on a Conservative/UKIP joint ticket in the 2015 general election, he said.

Mr Cameron has also come under fire from backbencher Douglas Carswell, who accused ministers of allowing civil servants to take over the Government.

He said: ‘I think we need to actually take on the Mandarinate, who all too often seem to be really running this government, and that is the fundamental problem.’

But Mr Carswell dismissed pressure for a leadership election, saying: ‘It would be extraordinarily disruptive.’

However, up to four groups of MPs are said to be plotting about Mr Cameron’s future. Allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie are urging him to make fresh interventions to burnish his own leadership credentials.

The Prime Minister's family break trip came just two days after he chaired a meeting of the Cabinet emergency committee Cobra to discuss the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, and the arrest of two suspected Islamic extremists.

Labour MP Sarah Champion said Mr Cameron’s decision to take a break showed he was 'utterly out of touch.'

She told the Sun: 'While the country 
struggles to come to terms with the vile crime in Woolwich this week and
investigations continue, he has swanned off to Ibiza.

'The public deserve better from their Prime Minister.'

There was also a negative reaction to the holiday on Twitter.

One critic said: 'Head of new Task Force to deal with extremism is running operations from a beach in Ibiza, #DavidCameron's "urgent approach"!!'

Backing the Prime Minister: Tory MP Nadine Dorries

Another wrote: 'Britain on terror alert. David Cameron on holiday in ibiza. About right then.'

Mrs Cameron is known to value private 
holidays with the family and the Prime Minister has admitted in the past
that she insists they get away together.

Mr Cameron has been accompanied by a small team of key staff and is being kept up to date over developments in the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Amid suggestions he should have remained in the country, Mr Cameron won support from an unlikely source.

Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, a well-known critic of her party's leader, said it was 'ridiculous' to criticise him for having a few days away'

She told Murnaghan on Sky News: "We have got the internet, we've got mobile phones. I think Cameron could actually get back from Ibiza to London quicker than if he was in Cornwall.

'I think he is entitled to a holiday, he's entitled to be with his family. I actually want the Prime Minister to be refreshed, feeling happy because he's had holiday time with his kids and his wife and come back and be a refreshed Prime Minister.'

Looking relaxed and casual, the couple sipped coffee against a picturesque beachside backdrop.
Mr Cameron, in a dark shirt and open-toed sandals, and his wife, who was
sporting a sun dress, were left undisturbed by nearby 
customers, including fellow Brits.

A No10 spokesman said: 'The PM is on 
holiday with his family for the week. As always, whilst away, he remains
in charge, and has office support with him.'

In
the past 24 hours, three men, aged 21, 24, and 28 were arrested in 
swoops by anti-terror police across London on suspicion of conspiracy to
commit murder.

Two of the suspects were Tasered before they surrendered in Charlton.

Officers searched four 
other addresses in Greenwich. Three people have been held for for making racial comments on Facebook and Twitter.

Two men arrested on suspicion of murder at the scene where drummer Rigby was killed on Wednesday remain in custody in hospital in a stable condition.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were shot and wounded by police.

A
29-year-old man, arrested on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to 
murder, has been bailed to return pending further inquiries.

A poll last week showed the public were 42.5 per cent in favour of calling MPs back from their Whitsun break to discuss the security crisis.

But voters surveyed in today's Mail On Sunday backed the Prime Minister's response to the incident in Woolwich.

He
was awarded a plus 19 rating for his handling of the situation, Labour 
leader Ed Miliband received a plus six rating, while Deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg was awarded zero.

Almost
two thirds of people in the UK believe we need more stringent terrorism
laws and would support the death penalty for terrorists, according to 
the online Survation poll.

Meanwhile, in Paris a French soldier was stabbed in the throat in what was feared to be a copycat of the attack on Mr Rigby.

Police described the assailant  as being 'bearded, of North African origin and wearing a light coloured jihab' under a jacket. He fled after the assault.

There has been a large increase in anti-Muslim incidents since Wednesday's murder, an inter-faith charity has said.

At Westminster, Mr Cameron is facing a revolt on two fronts, according to the Sunday Times.

Party donors are threatening to join UKIP and backbenchers have warned he may have to break up the coalition to remain leader.

Multimillionaire Lord Kalms, the former Conservative party treasurer, has said he is 'willing to pack my bags' and join the UK Independence party unless the PM adopts a bolder approach to Europe.

He told the paper: 'If UKIP has the right policies, that's where we'll go. I am very, very disenchanted and won't tolerate being dragged down into Europe without some fight.'

A growing number of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs, believe their party should withdraw from the coalition at least a year before the next general election in 2015 to save seats.
