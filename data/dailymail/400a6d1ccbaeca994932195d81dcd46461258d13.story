Chelsea have agreed a surprise deal to bring back Portuguese midfielder Tiago.

The 33-year-old has starred for Atletico Madrid in this past season, culminating in the Spanish league title and defeat in the Champions League final to Real Madrid, yet he is out of contract.

Jose Mourinho has already lined up a Â£38m deal with his club mate Diego Costa but Tiago's pending signature will no doubt help Costa settle in to life at Chelsea.
