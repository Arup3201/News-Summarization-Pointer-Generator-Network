Harper's Bazaar has enlisted supermodels including Lara Stone, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Liu Wen to showcase its Spring fashion favorites.

The zodiac-inspired shoot was conceptualized and cast by ex-Vogue Pairs editor Carine Roitfeld, the publication's 60-year-old global fashion director, and sees the models don neck collars carrying star sign emblems.

Ms Stone, 31, takes on Aries, posing in a shaggy pink $1,295 Coach coat; while Miss Huntington-Whiteley, 27, is lion-esque for Leo in a lace and leather Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci ensemble.

The publication's portfolio, which will run in all 31 editions worldwide, also spotlights 33-year-old Dutch model Saskia de Brauw, who represents Taurus, and two relative newcomers; Australian beauty Tegan Desmond and Texas-born model Sarah Brannon.

Ms Roitfeld has been at the helm of Harper's Bazaar's style pages since 2012, shortly after she resigned as the editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris.

She is also the editor of her own publication, CR Fashion Book.

The topper shade of the year? Pink. We’ve been crushing on fashion’s sweetest hue for seasons and seasons, but now the temperatures have dropped it’s time to play with some textures too. After all, there’s no better way to combine warmth and glamour than with fur!

Here Lara Stone is reminding us just how much a shaggy fur coat rocks as she steals the scene in this shaggy over-sized number from Coach, and erm, not much else. If you’ve got the dollar to invest in a designer coat then why not click right to Coach to get a similar shorter style?

But, if we’re honest, you really don’t need to spend big bucks if you don’t want to because as our edit below proves, there are some amazing high street styles to be found too. We can’t pick a favorite between, it’s totally acceptable to have four pink fur coats right?

Wear yours over an all-black palette for a fashion editor finish.

Ms Stone has been enjoying a successful career revival of late, having stepped out of the spotlight briefly following the birth of her son Alfred in 2013.

Most notably, the Dutch stunner, who is married to British comedian David Walliams, appeared last month in a racy Calvin Klein underwear campaign with Justin Bieber.

Miss Huntington Whiteley, who has been dating Hollywood hunk Jason Statham since 2010, is currently juggling her modeling career with her acting endeavors.

Her next film, Mad Max: Fury Road, is out on 15 May.

Liu Wen, once dubbed 'China's first bona fide supermodel',  made headlines around the world last year when she became the first person to showcase an Apple Watch on the cover of a magazine, for Vogue China's November 2014 issue.

Miss Wen - the highest-ranked model of Asian descent in history - has famously never had a boyfriend.

Harper's Bazaar's March issue hits newsstands February 17.
