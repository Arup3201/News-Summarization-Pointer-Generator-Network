There are plenty of ways to celebrate a sporting triumph, but sleeping in the kit you competed in is something that even John Terry would balk at.

Yet that is precisely what Jo Pavey did after winning the 10,000m gold medal at the European Championships in Zurich, as the considerate runner feared she would wake her room-mate Goldie Sayers when she got home.

Pavey, whose post-match routine was revealed by The Independent's athletics correspondent Matt Majendie, became the oldest ever winner at the  European Championships when she triumphed in Zurich.

The mother-of-two also took bronze in the 5,000m at the recent Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and on her lap of honour on Tuesday she gave a hug to her 11-month-old daughter Emily.

The athlete has confirmed that she will return to Portsmouth to compete in the Bupa Great South Run in October, where she will attempt to complete a glorious hat-trick of medals.

'The  Great South Run means a lot to me,' said Pavey, who will join 25,000 runners at the world's leading 10 mile running event, which celebrates its 25th staging this year.

'It just really suits me. I love the fact that it's 10 miles, and the course is fast and flat, and it's always a really competitive race. I love the atmosphere and finishing along the seafront in Portsmouth.

'I've had a great year and I'm excited to be going back. It would be nice to try and get a personal best this time.

'Even though I'm getting older, I still feel determined to try and run fast times.' 

Mo Farah will attempt to emulate Jo Pavey on Wednesday evening when he competes in the men's 10,000m event.
