A sherpa who has made it to the summit of Everest a record 21 times has hung up his trekking boots, and revealed that he has always hated climbing.Â 

Despite never wanting to reach the summit, Apa Sherpa holds an invincible record and led the first-ever expedition across the 1,700km Great Himalayan Trail last year.

Sixty years after Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay first summited Sagarmatha, the 51-year-old 'Super Sherpa' has been awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Utah for his dedication to the mountain.

Sixty years after Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay first summited Sagarmatha, the 51-year-old 'Super Sherpa' was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Utah for his dedication to the mountain

Having waved goodbye to Nepal and settled in the US Apa, known in the 
climbing world as the Michael Jordan of mountaineering, is now a cleaner
 at a plastic factory.

He said he had stepped aside for a new generation of mountaineers.

Apa said: 'I am making way for younger ones, and to support and look after my family. I want my children to have a good education.

'I would like one of them to become a doctor - that would be great if one of them could live up to my goal.

'It is an incredible honour to be awarded this and I am delighted to be recognised. I'm proud to have climbed the mountain the most times - some people can't even make it up once.

'The mountain blessed me and looks after me.'

In an interview with Las Vegas-based filmmaker Tami Bradshaw, who is exploring his remarkable life in 'Tiger of the Himalayas', the Super Sherpa admitted that American life takes quite some getting used to, but it's time to move on from climbing.

Apa said: 'I moved to the US to put my kids through school - it's totally different here. At home in Nepal we used to trek three hours to get food and three hours back, but here there's groceries right next to your house. We're spoilt being here.

'It wasn't easy to adjust here - like driving. We have to drive and can't walk anywhere. We didn't really understand the rules but now it's okay and it was a very good choice to move here.'

Apa's overwhelming life achievements began when he escaped death from an avalanche that flung him from his mother's arms down a Himalayan ice ledge at just two months old.

His faints cries were heard by his mother and he made a miraculous recovery - he has had a special connection with the mountain range ever since but never intended to climb Everest's 8,848 metres.

Since then he has become the only man in history to reach the top of the world 21 times.

Ironically, summiting Everest was never a goal for Apa.

At 12 years old he began working as an expedition porter to earn money following the death of his father.

Trekkers immediately noticed the child who, despite his exceedingly small stature, carried loads greater than his own weight with strength, quickness and a wide smile.

Apa said: 'When I was young I wanted to become a doctor. But I needed to support my family so I had to have a living and I quit school and became a porter.'The job of a Sherpa for both men and women is very risky because we never know if we'll live - but they have no choice they have to make money to live and for their families and kids' education.

'I got paid very little money at the time - it's not easy to carry more than your body weight and very heavy loads and walk every day - it's not fun.

'A lot of Sherpa's are killed on the mountain, some of my friends died every year on the mountains. It's extremely dangerous and we risk our lives.'

Coming from Thame, the hometown of Everest legend Tenzing Norgay, it was almost inevitable that Apa would become a high altitude Sherpa guide on Everest.

He began carrying loads on Everest in 1988, but it wasn't until May 10, 1990, that he reached the summit for the first time along with Rob Hall, Gary Ball, and Peter Hillary.

Since that memorable day, Apa has participated in 22 Everest expeditions and reached the summit 21 times.

Adhering to a simple philosophy that 'Everest will always be there' and it is more important to keep all team members and Sherpas safe, Apa has led his teams to amazing success.

Apa said: 'Everybody talks about Everest and Sir Edmund and Tenzing Norgay so I thought okay well maybe one day I could reach it at least once - I never had any intention of doing it so many times.

'When Rob and I climbed it it was the first time for us both, we eventually climbed it three times together and he was one of my best friends.'

However, despite persistent persuasion, Rob failed to coerce Apa into joining his 1996 mission after his wife Yangjin ordered him to stay put and help build the family home.

The excursion hit the headlines around the world for catastrophic reasons, Rob and seven others were killed just 24 hours into their journey. It has become known as the worst climbing disaster in the mountain's history.

Apa said: 'I was supposed to go in 1996 with Rob but my wife said I couldn't go because I needed to help build our house.

'My wife saved my life, if I'd have gone something could have happened to me - you'd never know if I'd have survived.'

Last year he became the first person to successfully lead an expedition across the 1,700km-long Great Himalayan Trail that spans the entire mountain range - Apa's team reached their destination 20 days ahead of schedule.

Apa was a good friend of Sir Edmund and led an expedition to carry his ashes to the top of Everest more than 50 years after he became the first person to reach the summit on May 29 1953.

But the Nepalese government forbid the ceremony and instead Apa climbed with a statue to pray for him at the top.

After hanging up his boots, he set up the Apa Sherpa Foundation to continue Sir Edmund's pioneering work helping Nepal's development and improving the lives of thousands of Sherpas and villagers.

Apa said: 'I met Sir Edmund many times and it was always very special, he used to come every year to Nepal and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot. He introduced schools, monasteries, clinics and health care.'
