Brendan Rodgers has all but ruled out the prospect of Liverpool signing Divock Origi in January to ease their striker crisis.

The Liverpool manager is reeling from the news that Daniel Sturridge is facing another six weeks on the sidelines, having broken down with a thigh problem on Monday. 

Rodgers says Sturridge is 'as down as he has ever seen him' and shattered by this latest setback.

'He has just been extremely unfortunate, he doesn't want to be out for this length of time,' said Rodgers of his injured forward, who hasn't played since getting injured in England training in September. 

'He will go away now to see what we can do to get him on the football pitch. Nobody wants that more than Daniel, he is as down as I have ever seen anyone. 

'We need to look to find the answers to work consistently for Liverpool. The England injury was one of a number. He has had nine injuries on that thigh, right through his career. 

'We are going to look across what has happened. He is a joy to work with. We want to get him fit and hopefully get him back. He had been back training, he had played in a practice game. It was a nothing action that caused the issue. It's unfortunate for Daniel, unfortunate for us but we cannot cry about it.'

Liverpool were prepared to offer more money if there was a chance of securing Origi's release from Lille in January and the Belgium international, who signed for Liverpool for £10million earlier this year, had indicated he would be prepared to move to the Premier League if a deal could be arranged.

Rodgers, though, believes the chances of getting Origi are virtually non-existent and has insisted he will channel his energies into the players he has who are fit and available.

'It was never the case of bringing him in early,' explained the Liverpool boss. 'The discussion last summer was that he had to stay. That was one of the reasons we got him. There has been a lot of speculation but the deal was in place that we would get him for next season.

Liverpool return to Crystal Palace on Sunday for the first time since they threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 against them last season in a game that became to be known as 'Crystanbul' - in reference to Liverpool's famous recovery from a three-goal deficit during the 2005 Champions Final against AC Milan in Istanbul.

But Rodgers is not concerned that the memories of that will have any impact on his side this time round, despite admitting that the result was 'disappointing'.

'Our objective was to win the game,' he said. 'We were 1-0 up and then got a quick couple of goals. The excitement then took over.

'On reflection after the game, I was proud of them for actually getting into that position in the league after I had got over the frustration and disappointment of the game.

'It wasn't the game that cost us. We played really well to get to 3-0. This is a new season, a terrific ground to go to.

'It's a game we are looking to get the victory in. This will be tough. We are looking to get the win. It is a difficult place to go. It has gone, we can't control what happened last season.

'The players are giving me everything. We just hope we an find that extra one per cent. Once you get the confidence, the wins start to flow.'
