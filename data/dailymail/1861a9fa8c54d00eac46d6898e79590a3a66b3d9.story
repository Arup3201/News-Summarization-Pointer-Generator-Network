'Crush': Wendi Deng wrote that she missed Tony Blair and his charm, his body and his 'butt'

Rupert Murdoch’s feud with Tony Blair over Wendi Deng flared up again last night after claims  that the tycoon had bullied the ‘embarrassed’ Prime Minister into becoming godfather to his and Ms Deng’s daughter.

In an investigation into reports that Mr Blair’s overnight stays with Ms Deng contributed to the Murdochs’ divorce, the Labour-supporting Guardian newspaper claimed:

Friends of Mr Murdoch last night hit back at the newspaper’s suggestion that he pressured a reluctant Mr Blair into becoming godfather  to his daughter Grace, then aged eight, in 2010.

‘It doesn’t ring true,’ said one London-based confidant of the media mogul. ‘The christening  was all Wendi’s doing, Rupert had virtually nothing to do with it.’

The source criticised the Guardian, saying: ‘It has made a lot of false statements about Rupert without bothering to check.’

Another Murdoch ally suggested Mr Blair may have had an ulterior motive for agreeing to become godfather: ‘He was raising money from Rupert for his causes at that time.’

Explaining the bitter rift between Mr Blair and News Corp boss Mr Murdoch, the Guardian said: ‘Hell hath few furies like a mogul who feels cuckolded by a man he had come to see as a true friend.’

It claimed Mr Blair was about to tell Mr Murdoch about one of his two overnight stays with Ms Deng at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, in 2012, but held his tongue when Murdoch and Ms Deng’s daughters, Grace, now 12, and Chloe, now ten, entered the room.

‘He should have left, say friends, but didn’t and we’re no longer there to tell him not to be an idiot,’ said the Guardian. ‘He should have told Murdoch when next they met, but didn’t. In the loyalist version, the Murdoch girls burst in just as he was about to.’

The newspaper said Mr Murdoch believes the allegations are true. ‘And so do loyal News Corp colleagues and the four children from his first two marriages.’

The Guardian continues: ‘Though friends insist Blair and his wife Cherie are a contented couple (despite long separations she works as a barrister, does charity work and has other interests) or that she would not tolerate affairs, rumours have inevitably become attached to him.’

The Guardian says a woman friend of Blair said: ‘He likes women around him, he’s rather flirty.’

The newspaper says his ‘friends seem to accept [his] assurances’ the allegations about Ms Deng are untrue, but adds money is the Blairs’ Achilles heel.

‘Blair stresses the need to fund and staff his philanthropic foundations, but his fondness for yachts, executive jets and Barbados holidays (“How much would I need to have a place like this?” he supposedly asked when staying at Cliff Richard’s home), is more apparent.’

The report follows the publication of a note in which Ms Deng wrote of her ‘crush’: ‘I’m so so missing Tony. He is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs.’

It referred to his ‘butt’ and continued: ‘.  .  . and what else and what else and what else...’

The Guardian suggests Mr Murdoch, 82, could not keep up with Ms Deng, 45. ‘Rupert would be going to the gym at 6am just as Wendi was coming in from a party.’

It says Mr Blair’s enemies have a new joke: ‘Why did Blair betray a friend? Because he could.’
