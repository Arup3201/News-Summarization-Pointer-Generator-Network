Deputy PM Nick Clegg says he is 'delighted' by their arrival

The first giant pandas to arrive in Britain for 17 years touched down at Edinburgh Zoo yesterday after an  11-hour flight from China on a specially-chartered jet. Now, as Sunshine and Sweetie settle into their luxury enclosure and eager fans clamour to see them, hopes are high they could produce the first ever panda cub born on British soil. Here, JOHN NAISH looks at what lies in store for these very special creatures . . .

A pair of international celebrities completed their much-anticipated 
move to Edinburgh last night, where they are now occupying £275,000 
suites and having their organic food flown in from the Continent.

They were met on Scottish soil by photographers, dignitaries and 
crowds of flag-waving locals clamouring for a glimpse of them. Earlier 
this week, a website selling tickets to see the pair crashed due to the 
demand.

But, in a departure from the usual celebrity script, the new arrivals are a pair of  giant pandas.

Yesterday, female Tian Tian (meaning Sweetie) and male Yang Guang 
(Sunshine) arrived in Edinburgh Zoo from a conservation centre in 
Sichuan, China, on a private Boeing 777F flight dubbed the ‘FedEx Panda 
Express’, along with a vet and two animal handlers.

They are on loan from China for the next ten years. Bagpipes played 
as the bears were carried carefully from the aircraft in individual 
crates, each labelled ‘one panda’ and taken to Edinburgh Zoo.

Tian Tian and Yang Guang have been put in enclosures designed by 
animal psychologists, which come complete with dens, private pools, a 
viewing platform and a room where the pandas will be given health 
check-ups.

The enclosure also has a specially built ‘love tunnel’ where the two 
can meet if they are feeling amorous, and a nursery for any offspring. 
Zoo bosses believe the pandas will attract more than a million extra 
visitors, and a baby panda would see numbers boom even further - 
although any cubs would be  the property of China.

Already there is eager adulation from the panda-mad public. Earlier 
this week, the zoo’s ticket website was unable to cope with the ‘sheer 
influx’ of people trying to book tickets and crashed. 

But then this pair are rare treasures: these are the first pandas in 
the UK for 17 years, since London Zoo hosted Bao Bao and Ming Ming in 
the early Nineties.

And the bears will need to be popular in order to fund their keep. 
The zoo is paying the Chinese around £636,000 a year for the privilege 
of having them. It also needs to buy them £70,000 worth of bamboo a 
year.

The bears will now have a fortnight to settle in before being put on 
show to the public. Although they have come as a pair, they will have 
separate rooms as solitary pandas only meet to mate once a year.

Their new living quarters are five-star. The animals love to clamber,
 so each has a climbing frame that will enable them to see each other 
over the tops of their enclosures.

The animal psychologists also designed the accommodation to simulate 
their natural habitat. Small caves are intended as outdoor bedrooms. 
There are his ’n’ hers ponds and shaped rocks that act like 
panda-recliners, so they can lie back to chew on their bamboo.

Alison Maclean, the pandas’ head-keeper, is delighted with the 
enclosure’s design. ‘It’s perfect,’ she says. ‘The visitors have huge 
viewing panels, both looking into the interior and exterior of the 
enclosures. It’s virtually soundproof, so the pandas won’t get 
disturbed.’

Pandas spend much of their time munching - as much as 14 hours a day 
chewing bamboo. Each year, they will eat up to 18,000kg (over 39,000lb) 
of the stuff - around 20 three-metre stems a day. This is no ordinary 
bamboo, either. Most of it will be imported from a specialist organic 
grower on a plantation just outside Amsterdam.

After all, you don’t want to let pandas get hungry. They can get very
 bearish. In 2009, for example, a giant panda killed eight sheep in a 
village near a nature reserve in Leshan in China.

In captivity, they have been known to maul humans. Even when 
well-fed, pandas are not completely herbivore. Around one per cent of 
their diet is carnivore — popular snacks are rats, mice and insects.

The one mod-con the pandas should not need is climate control. The 
weather in Edinburgh is very similar to that of their native Sichuan 
Province.

With all the right conditions, Edinburgh’s zoo keepers hope that the pampered pandas will be in the mood for love.

The conservation purpose of their decade-long stay is to produce offspring that can be returned to the wild.

Ten years is a significant proportion of a captive panda’s lifespan: 
they are normally expected to live for 30 years. Both are now eight.

Hopes are high that their stay will prove fruitful: Tian Tian and 
Yang Guang have both successfully mated before, but with other partners.
 While pandas are notoriously difficult to mate in captivity, Tian Tian 
and Yang Guang are said to stand a better chance than most of producing 
young. The ‘boisterous’ male, Yang Guang, is said to be better endowed 
than the average panda. He has already sired a string of cubs in the 
Ya’an reserve in China, where both pandas were born and raised.

And although Tian Tian, has been described as ‘a very quiet and nervous character’, she has given birth to two cubs.

Hugh Roberts, chief executive of the Scottish zoological society, 
said he was ‘very confident’ the pandas would become the first in 
Britain to breed naturally. ‘They both know what to do and that’s a 
start,’ he said. ‘I don’t think Yang Guang’s sexual prowess is in 
doubt.’

Nevertheless, the last British attempt ended in an acrimonious 
divorce: London Zoo’s Bao Bao and Ming Ming fought savagely and had to 
be separated. Bao Bao was sent to Berlin Zoo in 1993 and Ming Ming 
returned to China in 1994.

Their predecessors had fared little better. In 1974, the Conservative
 prime minister, Edward Heath, attempted to lighten the gloom of a 
Britain struck by economic crisis by bringing over Chia-Chia and 
Ching-Ching, in what was considered a coup of ‘panda diplomacy’ with the
 Communist regime.

But although the pair were loved by visitors to London Zoo, they didn’t seem to love each other, and were cubless to the end.

Pandas’ problems are exacerbated by the female’s very short period of
 fertility. Jennifer Butler, a spokeswoman for Edinburgh zoo, says: 
‘They only have a period of three days a year when the female is 
receptive. Within this, there is only a window of between 24 and 48 
hours when she is fertile.’

Worse still, male pandas can prove lackadaisical. In 2007, keepers at
 Northern Thailand’s Chiang Mai Zoo resorted to sitting a male called 
Chuang Chuang in front of a TV showing raunchy videos of bears mating in
 an attempt to spark his interest. The chief veterinarian, Kanika 
Limtrakul, was disappointed to admit ‘Chuang Chuang seemed indifferent’ 
to the films.

If Edinburgh does hit the panda cub jackpot, then it would prove a 
welcome boost to conservation efforts: there are as few as 1,600 giant 
pandas in central China.

Not everyone is a supporter, however. Chris Packham, the BBC wildlife
 presenter, has said pandas should be allowed to die out and the money 
spent on conserving them should go on other species. His words outraged 
the Chinese and threatened the loan deal for Tian Tian and Yang Guang.

But if a rare cub is produced, Edinburgh can expect an unprecedented 
frenzy because there is something about these creatures that pulls the 
heart strings. For example, a video on YouTube entitled Baby Panda 
Sneezing has been viewed 190 million times.

If such an adorable creature were to be born in Edinburgh, the 
visitor bonus to the nation would certainly not be worth sneezing at.
