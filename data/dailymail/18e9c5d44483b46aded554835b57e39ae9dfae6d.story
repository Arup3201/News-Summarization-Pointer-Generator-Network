RUGBY LEAGUE

New Zealand vs England

Set the alarm for 7am to see England face New Zealand in Dunedin. The visitors need to win by 10 points to guarantee a place in the Four Nations final in Wellington on November 15. Boss Steve McNamara has named an unchanged side despite losing last time out against Australia, albeit in controversial circumstances.

FOOTBALL

Australian A-League: Brisbane Roar vs Melbourne City

It may not be the most tantalising fixture of 'Super Saturday', but the A-League clash will give you the chance to charter the progress of former Blackburn, Chelsea and Fulham star Damien Duff in his Australian adventure when Melbourne City travel to Brisbane.

City, without David Villa who has departed for New York after only four games, are yet to win this term, but they should have the class to see off bottom-of-the-table Brisbane.

FOOTBALL

Premier League: Liverpool vs Chelsea

You’ll have enough time to make a bacon sarnie before tucking in to the pick of the Premier League fixtures. 

Stuttering Liverpool are already 12 points adrift of pacesetters Chelsea, but they will be keen to avenge last season’s home defeat against the Blues. That loss killed off any dreams Liverpool had of claiming their first title in more than two decades. 

Chelsea have been in imperious form this season but a  draw against European minnows Maribor in the week will give Liverpool hope.

DARTS

Defending champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is predictably favourite to win once more, but he’ll have world No 1 Michael van Gerwen breathing down his neck.

RUGBY UNION

England vs New Zealand

Pause. Touch. Engage. A quick flick of the remote will take you to Twickenham for the opening match of the Autumn Internationals and it’s a belter, too. 

England host World Champions New Zealand in front of 84,000 raucous fans and Stuart Lancaster’s men will be desperate to redress the 3-0 whitewash on their visit to the Southern Hemisphere earlier this year. But they will face an uphill task against rugby union’s very best.

FORMULA ONE

Brazilian Grand Prix qualifying

Can anyone stop Lewis Hamilton? The brilliant Brit is bidding to win his sixth consecutive race in his quest for a second world championship.

He is 24 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with just two races left, but the German remains optimistic he can wrestle the initiative back in his favour. Rain is on the radar for Saturday’s crucial qualifying, so pack your waterproofs for a wet and wild session.

FOOTBALL

Premier League: QPR vs Manchester City

The Premier League champions are out of sorts and out of form. After slumping to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League, boss Manuel Pellegrini needs three points to lift the gloom around the Etihad at the home of QPR. The Lofus Road outfit haven’t beaten City since 2000; surely a second shock of the week is not on the cards?
