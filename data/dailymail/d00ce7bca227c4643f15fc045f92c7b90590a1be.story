A 30-mile car chase ended with a 16-year-old joyrider smashing into another car - a few inches from two top newsreaders.

The bizarre coincidence happened yesterday in the west London district of Hammersmith, home to BBC veteran Kate Silverton and her Sky News rival Isabel Webster.

Ms Webster, 32, said it was a miracle no one was killed in the drama, which ended in the 16-year-old being arrested and another driver being taken to hospital.

Police began a chase in Salfords, Surrey - near Gatwick Airport - and scrambled several cars and a helicopter before it ended beside west London's Hammersmith Bridge at 1pm yesterday.

The VW Passat, which had been chased by a convoy of officers along the A3 into London, smashed into a Vauxhall Astra behind Sunrise presenter Ms Webster's car.

The Passat spun five times across the road, passing within inches of Ms Webster's car, while the driver of the Astra had to be taken to hospital with neck injuries.

By chance the crash was also witnessed by BBC veteran Ms Silverton, 44, as she walked with her three-year-old daughter and pushed her four-month-old baby in a pram.

The 'dazed' driver of the Passat - which Ms Webster said had been travelling at up to 70mph - remained shocked in his car before escaping on foot.

He was later arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and is still being questioned by police.

Under arrest: Police escort a young driver from the scene after a car chase which had lasted for 30 miles

Investigation: Police declared the area a crime scene as they examined the Passat and the Astra yesterday

Horror: Ms Webster said the crash left the driver of the car which was hit covered in blood. He was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, with neck injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening

Ms Webster, who presents the breakfast show alongside Eamonn Holmes, told MailOnline she was being dropped off at Hammersmith station by her husband Liam Pearce when the incident happened.

'It was one of those moments when you think "one of my nine lives has been used up",' she said. 'I think it's a miracle no one was killed. The guy was completely crazy, all over the place.

'We were pulling out of the road when the crash happened and the car the got hit was behind us. The Passat spun round about five times and ended up face to face with us.

'There was debris everywhere and we were right in the middle of it all.

'We went to help the guy in the car before realised he was being chased by police. He was in the car with the airbag up, his head back and his eyes were rolling back. He then got out the car and ran.

'We then turned our attention to this other guy, the driver of the car that got hit, who got dragged out of his car.

'He was on his knees and covered in blood. It's a miracle he didn't get killed.

'It happened so fast - a huge noise and impact and you kind of process it what's happened afterwards and realise it could have been a lot worse. My thoughts are with him and his family.'

The driver of the Astra was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, with neck injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening. 

Hammersmith Bridge was also closed  as the debris was cleared up.

Ms Webster said the incident had made her look at news reporting differently. 

She said: 'I reported the worst ever motorway crash, on the M5 in Bristol on Bonfire Night, and I was on the side of the road for several days but I guess this is the first time I've been a bit too close for comfort.

Damage: The front of the Astra was left wrecked in the crash, and the driver had to be taken to hospital

Cleanup: The road was closed as dozens of witnesses gathered at the scene to help those affected 

'As a journalist you report on the most horrendous things and it's just part of the job. But when it's "real life" it's totally different and makes you think about how you report these things.'

She and Ms Silverton live in the same area of west London, but have never met socially.

'We messaged on Twitter and we will probably be quite pally through this,' she said.

'I saw that she tweeted about it so I sent her a message saying "glad you're okay". We were both a bit shaken up.' 

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'At around 12.20pm yesterday, a VW Passat failed to stop for a marked police car in the Salfords area of Surrey.

'A pursuit followed which involved a number of Surrey Police vehicles and a police helicopter.

'The VW Passat travelled onto the A3 and into the London area where the Metropolitan Police joined and led the pursuit.

'A collision subsequently occurred in the Richmond area and a 16-year-old youth was arrested nearby on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was later transferred into custody in Surrey and enquiries are currently ongoing.'

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 1.05pm to reports of a collision between two cars. We sent an ambulance crew to the scene and treated a man for a neck injury. He was taken as a priority to St George's Hospital in Tooting.'
