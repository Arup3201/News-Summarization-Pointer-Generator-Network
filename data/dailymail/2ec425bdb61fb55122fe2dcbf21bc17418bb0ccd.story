Carla Bruni will record a French-language version of Do They Know It's Christmas?, her agent confirmed today.

Mrs Nicolas Sarkozy is rumoured to have lined up a number of French acts, including Daft Punk, for a continental take on the Band Aid song's revival in aid of the fight against Ebola in West Africa.

Earlier today, organizer Bob Geldof announced that the volume of pre-orders for the track ensured it had raised in excess of £1million within minutes of the song being premiered on TV last night.

Geldof announced the former first lady of France's involvement in the interview with the BBC. Ms Bruni's involvement was later confirmed to The Telegraph by her agent.

'The Germans go into bat today, I have asked the Germans to do the German version and I have asked Carla Bruni to do it in France, to translate it into French, so they're going next.'

Geldof has called the track 'a little bit of pop history' and said it delivered a powerful message about the urgent need to fight Ebola, estimated to have killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa.

He then went on to criticize the response from some national governments.

'The Germans aren't doing enough, frankly. Obviously the French have sent their troops to help in Guinea and of course the British, the squaddies are down in Sierra Leone,' he said.

Bob Geldof, pictured on X Factor last night, announced that both Germany and France are recording their own versions of the Band Aid song

'The Germans are the most powerful economy in Europe. They are laggards and they shouldn't be.

'It's as dangerous for them as it is for us. This thing is a flight away from us.'

The latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas, released today, has already raised more than £1million and is set to top the charts.

If it does, it will become the fourth time the charity record has taken the number one spot.

The original recording, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released.

It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia.

Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts.

Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal

All together: The Band Aid 2014 line up, from top row L-R: Kyle Simmons (Bastille),  William Farquarson (Bastille), Guy Garvey (Elbow), Chris 'Woody' Wood (Bastille), Chris Martin, Dan Smith (Bastille), Seal, Sir Bob Geldof, Karl Hyde (Underworld), Roger Taylor, Joe Suggs (Youtube), Alfie Deyes (Youtube), Milan Neil Amin-Smith (Clean Bandit) and Grace Chatto (Clean Bandit). Second Row L-R: Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Olly Murs, Sinead O'Connor, Ellie Goulding, Jessie Ware, Ed Sheeran, Zoella (Youtube), Angelique Kidjo, Emeli Sande, Paloma Faith. Front Row crouching: Midge Ure, Bono

The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur.

Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit.

Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were 'patronising, false and out of date'.

Sir Bob Geldof said he was spurred to mobilise today's pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola.

'The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,' said Sir Bob. 'The child died and the nurse died. You can't get more tragic than that.'

After this, Sir Bob – once disinclined to revisit Do They Know It's Christmas after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song.

Fixed in his mind, as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer Midge Ure, was the image of the nurse wiping away the child's tear.

Now the line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' is replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'.
