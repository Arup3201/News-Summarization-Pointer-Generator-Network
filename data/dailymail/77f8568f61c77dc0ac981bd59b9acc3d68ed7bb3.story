Colin Scotts was the biggest Australian name in NFL for many years and says rugby league star Jarryd Hayne has 'zero point one chance of making it but yes he can make it'.

And if he does, the former Arizona Cardinals defensive end believes Hayne can look forward to a $US3million annual salary.

'Are the odds against him, yes they are. Is it going to be difficult, yes, but if anyone can a super athlete like him can,' Scotts said.

Colin Scotts is the first ever Australian to find great success in American Football ranks. Opportunity came knocking when he was spotted by NFL scouts playing rugby for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1981

'He (Jarryd Hayne) is an inspiration, we should support him because what he's trying to do takes big balls,' says Colin Scotts

'He's walking into the most intense complex explosive game anywhere in the world at the age of 27 but I just think this country needs more people that decide life starts when you get out of your comfort zone,' the former NFL star added.

'He's an inspiration, we should support him because what he's trying to do takes big balls.

'Can he do it? Yes he can, you gotta believe, you know.'

Australian athletes have transitioned from AFL to American Football, from soccer and rugby union to NFL and even track and field - but never from rugby league to NFL.

Hayne would be blazing a trail not unlike Scotts, who became the first local rugby union player to make the transition.

Scotts now spends much of his time on the public speaking circuit - but still has personal and business interests in American Football -  he says special teams would suit the former Parramatta player.

Colin Scotts was offered a scholarship to play college football and would go onto the NFL with the Arizona Cardinals. Scotts played five years of college football and five years as a professional

Colin Scotts says Jarryd Hayne faces two big challenges. Firstly, dealing with the American psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and secondly, being able to play on synthetic surfaces

'They would have him straight away, like punt return, keep it simple for him,' he said.

'And he'd be great at it and then possibly a fullback position that blocks for the running back or even a running back, but he's gonna have to be quick because they're all like him over there.'

Scotts has urged Hayne to find out everything he can and learn from those who have blazed the trail before him.

His two biggest challenges, he insists, are dealing with the American psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and training on synthetic grass.

'As an outsider, I had to earn it and fight for acceptance by some who thought I'd stolen a place meant for an American,' he said.

'That's always going to be there, at the end of the day if he earns that respect as I did, it's a long road with that respect.

'And preparing himself for the different surface of synthetic grass, he should be talking to me number one, I know a lot about both issues and I'm here to help.

'He (Jarryd Hayne) can earn 2 to 3 million a year American, easily. Yes it's zero point 1 chance of happening, the guy's nearly 27 but I think the guy is the most humble bloke, has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of things going for him' says Colin Scotts

'He's got to get as much knowledge about what he is trying to do and that's about the athletic application and study of the game, he needs leads for the teams, has he got somewhere to go.

'This is a superstar of Australian sport migrating over to my sport, if I can help I will be happy to. I will enjoy watching this.

'Life starts at the end of your comfort zone and being afraid of not having a go and Australia needs to get behind him and it's inspirational for all of us to hear this. 

'He can earn 2 to 3 million a year American, easily. Yes it's zero point 1 chance of happening, the guy's nearly 27 but I think the guy is the most humble bloke, has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of things going for him.

'He's certainly got a beautiful confidence, he's a beautiful athlete and he's one of our greatest athletes, has beautiful balance, good hands and stocky legs and calmness when he does his stuff.

'Put it this way, he is playing a level above everybody else here so why not go and chase it?' 

Scotts, was the first Australian to win an American Football scholarship to play the game in the US with the Arizona Cardinals. He was spotted playing rugby for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1981 and his life changed forever.

He went on to success as defensive end for the University of Hawaii, the St Louis Cardinals, the Arizona Cardinals and the Houston Oilers.

He played five years of college football and five years as a professional.

On the Celebrity Speakers website they describe his breakthrough as an achievement which 'catapulted him into the world of professional American sport where he thrived for the next four years until, playing for the Houston Oilers, a freak injury taught him why the NFL is known as the Not For Long League'.

'Colin stayed on in the States, living the high life, taking on the world as a pro-wrestler, becoming a successful businessman in the area of natural gas, telecommunications, and home health care, before returning to Sydney for the Olympics.'

While Colin Scotts and the likes of Jesse Williams (Australia's first ever Super Bowl winner) of the Seattle Seahawks have battled through the college system and in the line of scrimmage, most success for Australians making the transition has been via AFL and into a punting role.

Darren Bennett played 159 games and can also lay claim to being among the most successful of the Aussies, having enjoyed a decorated career in San Diego Chargers colours. 

The Rocca brothers, Sav and Anthony both followed him into roles as a kicker, Sav making a mark as the oldest rookie to play the game professionally in the US. 

'Strong minds and brave hearts, let's not just sit around and not have a go or knock people who are having a go,' Colin Scotts said.

'If Jarryd was to make it, whether on special teams or otherwise, wow it'd be some achievement.'

Jesse Williams is the only Australian to ever win a Super Bowl ring after success last season with the Seattle Seahawks. He's currently on the sidelines with a knee injury

Darren Bennett enjoyed a successful AFL career at home before launching his kicking career in the NFL to become one of the most successful Antipodeans in American Football with the San Diego Chargers
