Arsenal's table-topping footballers posted a 'get well soon' message to Michael Schumacher on Instagram after their 2-0 victory over Cardiff City at the Emirates.

Their tribute came hours after Schumacher's manager described his condition as 'stable' by his manager in the wake of his skiing accident.

The German F1 ace has spent a third night at the University Hospital of Grenoble, where he was taken after the accident on Sunday.

The 44-year-old seven-time Formula One world champion hit his head at Meribel in the French Alps and there was grave concern for his condition.

Stable: Michael Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said there was no change in the German's condition

He was put in a medically-induced coma
 and there were genuine fears for his life on Sunday and Monday, but 
better news came on Tuesday when doctors reported a slight improvement 
in his condition.

There 
was no need for the doctors to face the media on Wednesday either, with 
Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm giving an update from outside the 
hospital.

Kehm said: 'Michael's condition has been supervised all the night and remained stable over the night and also now.

'The
 good news for today is that we do not have the feeling to hold a press 
conference because there are no significant changes.'

Kehm's
 briefing is the latest positive signal to come out of the hospital 
after those treating Schumacher reported better news on Tuesday.

They
 said there had been a slight improvement in his condition, with surgery
 carried out to remove a dangerous haematoma on his brain.

Doctors
 had not expected to be able to carry out the procedure so quickly, but a
 scan showed them that the pressure on Schumacher's brain had eased 
sufficiently for them to do so without risk.

The
 improvement continued into Tuesday morning, with Kehm now reporting a 
period of calm, a day after the told of how a journalist had posed as a 
priest in order to try and access Schumacher's hospital room.
