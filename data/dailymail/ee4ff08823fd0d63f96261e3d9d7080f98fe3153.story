It is an old fortress on a tiny island, surrounded by pine trees and the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean Sea – the sort of property that looks like it should play host to the great and good.

Indeed, for a long time, it has.

Three years ago, Fort de Bregancon hit the international headlines when a pregnant Carla Bruni - wife of the then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy - was photographed strolling on its terrace.

Island hideaway: The Fort de Bregancon was the holiday home of the French president from 1968 to 2013

For over four decades, the Fort has been the very private holiday retreat of French leaders – a hideaway that has witnessed the private sojourns of the Gallic men (and women) of power.

Now, after 45 years of being a restricted area, it is open to the public.

The 
current French president Francois Hollande has decided to break with 
tradition and show the villa to the population for the first time – 
as a symbol of a toned-down presidential lifestyle in tough economic 
times.

However, there are also suggestions that he has dispensed with the property because he is not enamoured with the lack of privacy it affords.

Carla Bruni would surely agree.

Sarkozy holiday retreat: The former French president and his wife Carla Bruni, were fond of the retreat, and pictures of her with a growing baby bump in 2011 were broadcast round the world

Favourite of French presidents: Francois Hollande (pictured with his ex Valerie Trierweiler in 2012) is also a fan of the holiday location but has opened the doors to the public

Images of her with a growing baby bump, captured by paparazzi in May 2011, broadcast news of her pregnancy to the world.

The
 property has no swimming pool – forcing bathers out to the beach, giving any lurking photographers better opportunities to take pictures of 
presidential couples in swimwear.

Sarkozy was fond of the fort, using it as a regular summer base, and was often seen cycling and jogging in its vicinity.

But after 
he married model-singer Bruni, he also liked to escape to her more 
luxurious villa at Cap Negre.

Dream hideaway. Or is it? Although based on its own island, the property falls within range of paparazzi lenses

The villa 
is located on one of the most beautiful parts of the French Riviera, 
some 25 miles east of Toulon, and a similar distance west of the gilded 
resort of Saint-Tropez.

It was a closed shop between 1968 and 2013 – but as of this summer, visitors can walk in its salons, dining rooms and offices.

They
 should not, though, expect the marble, gilding and elegant parquet 
floors that you find in many French palaces.

Instead, the white walls 
and simple tiles on the floor – in the local Mediterranean style – make 
it look like a family house.

A certain simplicity: The property is more of a rustic Mediterranean retreat than a grand palace

The property’s simplicity is its main attraction, says Bernard Le Magoarou, the administrator of the fort.

‘It is the charm of the place,’ he says.

‘The president can live like ordinary people do, in a simple environment.’

Built in the Middle Ages, it became state property during the French Revolution of the late 18th century.

Former president Charles de Gaulle made it the official residence after spending a memorable – if not very pleasant – night at the fort in 1964.

‘He had a terrible night, because of the mosquitoes and a bed that was too small. He decided to renovate it,’ Le Magoarou says.

Taking a peek: The public are now able to visit a property that hosted French leaders for over four decades

Since then, every French president has ventured to the property to take time off from the demands of the Elysees Palace in Paris, to rest under the sound of the cicadas, and to enjoy the private beach and the spectacular view from the patio.

Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette visited the island many times during his presidency (from 1995 to 2007), regularly meeting residents of the neighboring village.

Not ideal: Some of the stylings in the property are decidedly dated - and its is very close to a public beach
