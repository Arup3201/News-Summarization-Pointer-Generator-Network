It's long been the sophisticated woman's go-to fashion brand and this week Whistles is finally dipping a toe into the menswear market. The high street giant is rolling out its new men's collection in 24 shops round the country.

But Whistles' first foray into male territory isn't all understated sophistication as one might expect.

Amongst the clean-cut lines and smart separates are a few surprising numbers - most notably this £235 crew-neck sweater in fuchsia pink.

If you can't imagine your man in it, perhaps Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson can persuade you.

Shpherdson, who famously turned Top Shop into a mega brand before joining Whistles five years ago, told Louise France of The Saturday Times Magazine, 'The contrast of a fluffy pink jumper on a guy who looks quite hard works. It is really sexy.'

She also added that it's all about 'looking cool, without looking like an a***hole.'

Nevertheless, we can't imagine the brand's most famous fan, the Duchess of Cambridge, picking this one out for her man.

Other items that stand out amongst the otherwise elegant collection include a bright blue and black striped jumper and a camouflage print sweater.

The more classic pieces, perhaps more likely to make Wills's wardrobe, include over-sized coats made from
 the super-soft wool, simple leather biker jackets and a pair of wool jogging 
trousers for that casual yet sophisticated look.

The leather jackets have a £395 price tag, knitwear starts at £125 and casual separates can be found for under £100.

'At Whistles we value the power of understatement and believe that sharpness, quality and function are what really resonate today,' says Shepherdson of the new range.

'Menswear is built around a tightly edited core of familiar pieces, so making it feel relevant comes down to perfecting the details and subtly updating them,' she adds.

'If the simple things don’t look brilliant, how can you expect customers to fall for the more standout pieces?'

Shepherdson revealed to the Saturday Times Magazine that at Whistles headquarters they created a 'dude board' where they'd pin pictures of their fantasy Whistles man.

The brand describe the collection as 'both accessible and timeless' but will shoppers agree?

The chosen icons included Ben Whishaw, until they decided he was too romantic, Ryan Gosling and Steve McQueen.

To help understand what real men wanted from their clothing, Whistles ran focus groups. They discovered that small changing rooms and pockets that aren't big enough for smartphones are prime fashion faux-pas for men.

But if they find a product they like, she also discovered they'll go back and buy more of exactly the same thing.

After all their research, the brand has come up with a collection they describe as 'both accessible and timeless with an emphasis on newness guaranteed to keep men returning each season for exciting, wearable looks'. Will shoppers agree? Only time will tell.

Let the shopping begin!
