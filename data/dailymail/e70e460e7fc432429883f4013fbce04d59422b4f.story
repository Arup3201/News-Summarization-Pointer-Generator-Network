Caroline Kennedy has said that she will 'absolutely' endorse Hillary Clinton 'if she runs' for president in 2016.

The two women from similarly powerful Democratic clans have had a turbulent history in the past, but in a new interview, the American Ambassador to Japan gave a measured hint of an endorsement.

'I know it sounds like a cliché, but two years is a really long time in politics. I’m sure she’s looking forward to being a grandmother, I know she’s got to decide soon. So, so you know I hope so,' Kennedy said in an interview with ABC.

Serious support: Caroline Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, seen here in 2000 when Clinton was running for Senate, have been allies for years making it even more of a shock when Kennedy opted to support Obama over Clinton in 2008

Payback: President Obama appointed Caroline Kennedy (seen together in Japan on Thursday) as the new American ambassador to Japan in a move that many saw as a 'thank you' for her critical support in his 2008 race against Hillary Clinton

Kennedy's endorsement can be a powerful thing, and though it was assumed that she would lend her name to her longtime ally Clinton during the 2008 presidential race, she actually turned the tide by coming out in support of Barack Obama in January of that year.

Many considered Caroline's endorsement, as well as that of her now-deceased uncle Senator Ted Kennedy, of Obama as the point in which the Democratic base began to switch over from the former First Lady's camp to that of the one-term Senator from Illinois.

The drama between Clinton and Kennedy was not fully put to bed until nearly a year later, after Obama was elected and he had selected Clinton as his Secretary of State.

Kennedy expressed an interest in being nominated to take over for Clinton, who was one of the New York Senators at the time.

Keeping her options open: Kennedy said that she would 'absolutely' support Clinton (seen on Wednesday at a talk in Connecticut) in a 2016 race but echoed Clinton's own assertions that she has not yet made up her mind

Clinton's loyal band of supporters promptly attacked Kennedy, calling her out for barely donating to political causes and in some cases 'forgetting' to even vote.

Clinton was the one to call off the attack dogs, and The Daily News reported at the time that she made sure that 'supporters who said anything critical were rebuked'.

The wording of Kennedy’s ‘endorsement’ of Clinton shows some degree of hesitation.

It may well be because Clinton has clearly not made a formal announcement of her intentions of running in 2016- even though polls have her leaps and bounds ahead of any other Democratic candidate, including Vice President Joe Biden.

Another more long-shot theory, proposed by The Washington Post shortly after Kennedy was named as the new Ambassador to Japan, is that Kennedy herself plans to run for the White House in 2016 and fulfil her family destiny by taking over where her father’s legacy was cut short.

Picking sides: The Democratic primary race effectively switched from having Hillary Clinton in the lead to then-one-term Senator Barack Obama once Kennedy chose him over her

‘Could Hillary Clinton be shoved from the limelight twice by Caroline Kennedy? While that might sound premature, Kennedy delivered the argument for charisma and vision over experience when she and her uncle dealt Clinton the first of many blows in the 2008 campaign,’ reporter Jennifer Rubin wrote in The Washington Post.

In her initial op-ed of support of Obama in 2008, Kennedy said that he would be 'a President like my father' and noted the importance of persona and personality.

'It isn’t that the other candidates are not experienced or knowledgeable. But this year, that may not be enough,' she said in a 2008 editorial in The New York Times.

Party over person: The Kennedys and Clintons are arguably the two most powerful Democratic families in American politics (Caroline, her husband Ed Schlossberg and her uncle Ted Kennedy seen greeting the then-President and First Lady in 1997)

‘Sometimes it takes a while to recognize that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves, to tie that belief to our highest ideals and imagine that together we can do great things. In those rare moments, when such a person comes along, we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible.’

During the interview that was released Thursday, which coincided with the President's visit to Japan, Kennedy made it clear that she thinks he has held up his end of the bargain- even if many other Democrats are trying to distance themselves due to his low poll numbers.

'I think he’s been a great president. And I think that this rebalanced Asia is a really good example of somebody who’s taking the long view, advancing the United States interest,' she said to ABC.

Caroline Kennedy has said she will support Clinton even though she opted for her rival- then-Senator Barack Obama- in the 2008 presidential race

@highlight

Even Kennedy hedged her hint of a Clinton endorsement by saying 'two years is a really long time in politics' so she may not end up running

@highlight

The Kennedy 2008 endorsement was largely seen as the reason why Obama won the Democratic nomination

@highlight

Kennedy then tried to run for the Senate seat Clinton left when she was chosen as Secretary of State but Clinton's supporters attacked her

@highlight

Clinton was the one to call off their attacks
