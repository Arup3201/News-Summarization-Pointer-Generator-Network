This is the incredible moment a mortar exploded just yards in front of a car as it travelled along a highway in Ukraine.

Vladimir Prach was driving down the road near the pro-Russian separatist-controlled city of Donetsk when the shell landed in front of him.

It slammed into the concrete, causing a huge explosion and sending chunks of tarmac flying through the air.

The terrifying incident was captured on Mr Prach's dashcam and later uploaded to the Russian social media site VKontakte.

But although the motorist escaped being hit by the mortar, his car was destroyed just seconds later after it crashed into the debris on the road.

Footage shows the blue vehicle covered in dirt and dust, with a smashed-in front and its front wheels dangling over a crater, following its near-collision with the mortar.

Mr Prach, who lives in the eastern city of Donetsk, said: 'I climbed out of the car and saw that it
 had been wrecked but somehow it didn't seem important.Â

'When you see a 
live shell blow up in front of you and realise how close that was to 
killing you, somehow it's just good to be alive.'

The mortar is believed to have been fired by Ukrainian forces.

It comes as Ukrainian troops have warned civilians in Donetsk to leave their homes ahead of a possible major assault on the rebel stronghold.

The military has already taken the town of Yasynuvata, home to a key railway control centre between Donetsk and Luhansk.

Its offensive has pushed
 the rebels into the two cities, which they have now 
proclaimed capitals of two 'people's republics'.

Today, residents
 in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine's main industrial hub which has seen the bulk of the fighting, said Ukrainian warplanes had carried out air strikes and shelling 
overnight.

Massive explosions could be heard in the area during the night, while numerous holes and craters were spotted in the ground in an industrial district near the city centre this morning.

'The
 planes were flying low. Then there were two massive explosions and the 
glass was blown out of the window. It was terrifying. This is war. There
 will never be peace,' a local woman named Nadezhda told Reuters.

But this afternoon, government
 military spokesman Lysenko denied Ukrainian planes had carried out air 
strikes.

'The Ukrainian military does not bomb the towns of Donetsk and 
Luhansk or any other similar populated places,' he said.

Many
 residents have fled the two cities, but hundreds of thousands of people
 are still living in them, increasingly fearful that they will bear the 
brunt of a full-blown assault.

Meanwhile, Russia
 has massed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's border and 
could use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade, NATO said today.

With
 fighting escalating and rebels losing ground in the weeks since
Malaysian airliner MH17 was shot down over separatist-held territory, Russia 
has announced military exercises this week in the border region.

It is the starkest warning yet that Moscow could soon mount a 
ground assault against its neighbour.

'We're
 not going to guess what's on Russia's mind, but we can see what Russia 
is doing on the ground - and that is of great concern. Russia has 
amassed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's eastern border,' 
NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said in a statement.

Moscow
 could use 'the pretext of a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission as an
 excuse to send troops into Eastern Ukraine', she added.

A NATO 
military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the build-up at the border included tanks, infantry, artillery, air 
defence systems, logistics troops, special forces, and various aircraft.

Since
 March, Russian President Vladamir Putin has vowed to use military force to protect 
Russian-speaking 'compatriots' across the former Soviet Union.

He has also 
branded southern and eastern Ukraine 'New Russia', a name the rebels 
took up as the banner for their movement.

Polish
 Prime Minister Donald Tusk today said the threat of a direct 
intervention by Russia's military in Ukraine has risen over the last 
couple of days.

Since
 June, Ukrainian troops have gained ground against the rebels, who are 
led almost exclusively by Russian citizens and have managed to acquire a range of 
tanks, missiles and other heavy weaponry.

Kiev
 said 18 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed and 54 injured in 25 
separate clashes over the past day in eastern Ukraine.

Military 
spokesman Andriy Lysenko said troops had been shelled from inside 
Russian territory and frontier guards had come under a four-hour mortar 
and artillery attack.

Fighting
 has intensified since Malaysian flight MH17 crashed on July 17, killing
 all 298 people on board.

Western countries say it was shot down by 
rebels with an advanced anti-aircraft missile supplied by Russia. However, Moscow
 denies blame, and the Russians who command the rebels deny they had 
such missiles.

The United 
States and the European Union have sharply tightened the sanctions imposed on Russia since the airliner was brought
 down.

Today,
 Ukrainian media published images they claim shows wreckage from the 
downed Malaysian aircraft is being used as part of a roadblock leading 
into the breakaway Donetsk region.

The
 photographs, taken by Ukrainian journalists, purport to show part of 
the aircraft's fuselage being used to strengthen a roadblock near the 
village of Rassypnoye.

Journalist
 Boris Mihalov, 32, said: 'We wanted to take more pictures and question 
those about how the wreckage was being used in this way but we were 
basically ambushed and carted away.

'They
 wanted to take the camera's memory card but we gave them an empty one 
and hid the one with the photograph where they didn't see it.'

The pictures have now been handed over to Ukrainian authorities.
