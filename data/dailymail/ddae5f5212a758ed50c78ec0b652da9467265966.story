Marco Reus is ready to snub interest from Arsenal and Real Madrid and commit his future to Borussia Dortmund.

The 25-year-old German international midfielder was expected to leave the Bundesliga strugglers in the summer.

Arsenal and Real Madrid were poised to activate the £20million release clause in his contract, which runs until 2017.

Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had revealed the club were also weighing up an offer  although their interest had recently cooled.

However local paper Ruhr Nachrichten and Dortmund's Radio 91.2 reported on Monday that Reus is set to sign a new deal at Dormund

'We have put all our cards on the table, the ball is now in Marco's field,' BVB CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told the paper.

'We have our limits, and Marco knows that,' Watzke said about the alleged Real Madrid offer. 

Reus helped lift the gllom and move Dormund off the bottom of the table by scoring in the 3-0 victory at Freiburg on Saturday, only their second away win of the season.
