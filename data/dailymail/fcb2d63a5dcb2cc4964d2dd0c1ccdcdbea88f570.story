The 'Carrier IQ' diagnostic software is used by U.S. phone networks to monitor phone usage - but some users worry that it monitors them a little TOO much. New apps such as Carrier IQ Detector let users find out if the app is installed on their phone

Security experts are divided over whether Carrier IQ - a monitoring 'tool' used by U.S. phone networks to track phone usage - is as sinister as it appears.

Last week, a security expert demonstrated the application 'reading' text messages and monitoring web browsing - and then transmitting the data to Carrier IQ.

Carrier IQ vigorously defended itself against the charges, saying that the software was just designed for 'diagnostics'.

But a new app at least offers Android users peace of mind about the software, by telling them whether the software is installed in their phone.

Carrier IQ Detector is downloadable free from Android market, and running the app instantly tells you if the 'diagnostic' software is installed in your phone.

'Security researchers have recently determined that a number of consumer mobile devices contain pre-installed software from Carrier IQ,' says the app's descripction.

'While this software appears to be designed to help mobile network operators improve coverage through metrics tracking, it does not provide a clear opt-out path for users.'

'Additionally, it can be difficult for non-technical users to determine whether or not their handset is affected. We've developed the Carrier IQ Detector to aid in this process in an effort to keep mobile users fully informed about what their phone is doing.'

What Carrier IQ Detector can't do, though, is uninstall the Carrier IQ software.

It's so deeply embedded in the firmware that it's near-impossible to remove.

Spyware
researcher Trevor Eckhart showed off a video last week demonstrating 
that 'Carrier IQ' - software buried deep within the operating systems of
American mobiles to provide mobile carriers with information - might be
snooping a little more than it should.

Eckhart's
demonstration showed the software 'reading' the contents of text 
messages and web browsing on an HTC Android phone, and transmitting the 
information.

Since then, 
handset makers such as RIM, Nokia and Apple have rushed to distance 
themselves from the software - portraying the 'spyware' as an 
Android-only problem.

Eckhart's demo used an HTC phone.

Since
then, US Senator Al Franken has asked the software company to respond 
to Eckhart's claim - and an Illinois resident has filed a lawsuit 
against the company.

Carrier IQ - whose software is used on millions of handsets across the US - released a statement.

'While
a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of 
information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our
software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS 
messages, email, photographs, audio or video,' the company said.

'For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do 
not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which 
applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen.'
