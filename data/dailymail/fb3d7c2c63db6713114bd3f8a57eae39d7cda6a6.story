A man who wears a nappy every day and has caused controversy for running a nursery for adults has appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show to defend his right to dress up as a baby. 

Derek Ventham, 52, and his wife Maxine appeared on the ITV show today to explain how the service they offer - and Derek's penchant for nappies - is not sexually motivated. 

Derek said: 'I'm like any other person, I get up, have breakfast and go to work. I have to wear a nappy all the time as I suffer from incontinence.'

Derek Ventham appeared on today's Jeremy Kyle Show to talk about why he wears nappies

The 52-year-old, pictured wearing a nappy, said dressing up as a baby is not a sexual fetish. He said he wears nappies because he's incontinent and because he's 'fascinated' by them

However Derek admitted he would still wear a nappy if he didn't suffer from incontinence or wet the bed - because it's something he has done since he was a teenager.

He explained: 'This was a liking I've had since I was seven, a fascination for nappies. It's not sexual.'

Derek and Maxine now live in Liverpool where they run 'Nursery Thymes', a place where  adults can regress back to an infant-like state in which they wear nappies, have books read to them and even experience a nappy change.

The couple had lived in Portsmouth but were forced to move after they were branded 'perverts' by their neighbours following Derek's appearance on Channel 4 documentary The 15-Stone Babies in 2012.

On the show, Derek had explained his love of dressing up and acting like a baby and was filmed having a nappy changed by his wife.

He said on the show that people who call him a paedophile and a pervert have got his interest all wrong.

He said: 'We don't want to be with children, we want to be the child.' 

Despite his recent TV appearances, Derek told Jeremy Kyle that they don't 'force this on anyone, we keep it private and hidden'.

Maxine said they shouldn't be judged for their adult nursery which is used by people from all walks of life

They say business is booming at their adult nursery where customers are charged £75 an hour to play with toys, have nap time in adult-size cribs and dress up in nappies and children's clothes.

There is a £25 surplus charge for a nappy change while staying overnight costs £350.

'Mummy Maxine' and 'Daddy Derek' explain on their website: 'We are nursery-thymes, we have been running our nursery for 14 years. We look after adult babies in our adult sized nursery, we look after you the way you want and cater your stay to the care you want.

'Sitting in the high chair being fed by mummy or having your nappy changed in the big cot, we have lots of cuddly toys to play with, come along and relax in a warm friendly atmosphere, let us make your dreams come true. You must be over 18 too visit our nursery.' 

The couple say their clients come from all walks of life and some like to pretend to be a baby to get away from the stresses of everyday life. For others, the regression is a chance to deal with past childhood traumas.  

Maxine told Kyle: 'There is a stigma about what we do and people have an opinion and think you are a pervert.

'We are normal working people who happen to like to dress in a certain way, each to their own.'
