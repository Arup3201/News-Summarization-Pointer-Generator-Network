Frustrated: Alex McTeer told his mother he was fed up with doing homework, so decided to write a letter to David Cameron

Schoolboy Alex McTeer, 10, was so angry about having to do school work after class, he told his mother he wanted to write to the Prime Minister.

But when he received a reply, it seemed David Cameron's staff had not done enough homework themselves, as the date on the correspondence was wrong.

Alex, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, explained to his mother he'd 'had enough' of homework and penned a note to the PM in the hope he would take action.

The response was signed by Stephanie, a 10 Downing Street Correspondence Officer.

It stresses the need to be ‘well organised’ - despite the fact the date was wrong by 12 months - stating it was 2013 rather than 2014.

He wrote: 'Dear Mr Cameron, I am writing to ask if you will change the law so children don't have to do  homework, especially on a Friday.

'I work really hard at school every day and think that when I get home it  should be my time to play with friends and chill out.

'Please write back. Alex McTeer, 10, From Sheffield.'

Alex’s mother, Nicola Robinson, said while her son was thrilled to get a letter back in February. he was not pleased that Cameron could not help stop him having to  do homework.

Miss Robinson, a PR manager, said: 'Every Friday he gets sent home with homework and it really grates on him. He hates doing homework because he thinks home time is his time to play.

'He says he gets worked hard enough at school so one day he came home and said, "Mum, I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to write to the Prime Minister".

'It’s given Alex a real lift and has helped make him understand how important homework is.

The schoolboy wrote: 'Dear Mr Cameron, I am writing to ask if you will change the law so children don't have to do  homework, especially on a Friday'

The letter was signed by Stephanie, a 10 Downing Street Correspondence Officer. It stresses the need to be 'well organised' - despite getting the date wrong by twelve months

'I wouldn’t say he’s absolutely delighted about it, but he does crack on with it now.

'When he grows up he had wanted to join the police force, but I think he would like to be Prime Minister now.'

Miss Robinson and her partner Paul McTeer encouraged Alex to send off his letter at  the end of January.

She said: 'It said on the letter why children have to do homework and how important it is.

'It also said that Mr Cameron would want Alex to do well in his future studies. Alex was delighted he got an official letter.'

'His father and I didn't help with the letter at all, he just sat and wrote a letter asking Mr Cameron to change the law so that children didn't have to do  homework any more.

'If he could get to the House of Commons and speak out himself I'm certain he would do it. It's clearly a subject he's passionate about and he's always been  a very confident child.

'I don't think it was the reply he wanted, to be honest. But he was delighted to get a reply and I think he understands more that doing homework will help  him to have a good future.

'He still doesn't like doing his homework. But he hasn't been complaining as much just recently about it.'

Respite: He claimed that he works very hard during the day and should be able to play and 'chill out' with his friends when he gets home

Action: The schoolboy wanted David Cameron to raise the issue of homework in the Commons
