It was one of the most dramatic cutbacks of George Osborne’s tenure in the Treasury.

But when the Chancellor underwent his makeover in a smart London hair salon, he had ‘no idea’ how much of his mop would end up on the stylist’s floor.

A new book reveals a powerful aide charged with improving Mr Osborne’s image did not tell him he was going to be sporting a mod-ish cut to widen his appeal to voters.

Mr Osborne has insisted he was always prepared for unpopularity after taking charge of the nation’s dire finances in 2010.

He was confronted with voters’ anger very publicly in 2012 when he was booed while handing out medals at the Paralympics in London.

He later hired Thea Rogers, a former producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson, to manage his image.

She is credited with his repeated visits to building sites, inevitably wearing hi-vis, to portray a more business-minded politician outside the Westminster bubble.

The hair cut was part of an image makeover, ordered by adviser Thea Rogers (left), which has also seen Mr Osborne jogging regularly and following the 5:2 diet to get in shape

But one of the most striking changes was unveiled at the Tory party conference in 2013, when his long, unruly style was replaced with the sharp, cropped look.

Now an updated version of George Osborne: The Austerity Chancellor, by Janan Ganesh, reveals he was in the dark about his makeover, according to The Times.

‘Thea Rogers joined George Osborne last year as one of his advisers and set about sprucing up his image with a new half-mod, half-Caesar haircut,’ Mr Ganesh writes. ‘This involved some subterfuge: the chancellor had no idea how much hair was being lopped off his head as he sat for the stylist.’

At the time, Mr Osborne admitted that the new look was in part designed to disguise a bald spot.

He joked that Michael Gove had told him: ‘You have applied your economic policy to your hairstyle. You have turned it around to stop the recession.’

Mr Osborne's aide Thea Rogers is also credited with creating his 'hard hat tour' of factories and building sites, often wearing hi-vis outfits

Aides say stories mocking the Chancellor's hi-vis visits are proof the makeover is 'cutting through' to voters

The new look got the seal of approval from his wife, Francis, but Mr Osborne has since sought to play down its importance, claiming in February this year that there are ‘more important things, dare I say it, for the country to be talking about’.

However, privately aides at delighted at the shifting public perception of the Chancellor.

The focus on Mr Osborne’s visits to building sites, factories and warehouses, always wearing fluorescent yellow and orange, have been mocked at times.

But advisers say it is proof that the makeover is ‘cutting through’.

In addition to the haircut, Mr Osborne also started following the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. Mr Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan.

The Chancellor has also been pictured sweating and exhausted running around St James’s Park, across the road from the Treasury.

He also started wearing a Jawbone wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime.
