Former Vice President Dick Cheney laid into President Barack Obama and his administration today for failing to recognize sooner the perils of allowing the Islamic State to thrive in Iraq and Syria.

'A realistic strategy has to recognize that ISIS is a grave strategic threat to the United States,' Cheney said during a speech on national security in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning.

The current situation is 'dire,' he said, and it 'one of the most dangerous we have faced certainly in my lifetime, and far more dangerous than the administration has been willing to admit.'

Former Vice President Dick Cheney described ISIS as a 'grave strategic threat' and said President Barack Obama and his administration need to wake up to that fact

Cheney said that 'Al Qaeda is not diminished, nor is the tide of war receding' and 'wishing does not make it so.'

'Our president must understand that we are at war and we must do what it takes for as long as it takes to win,' the former Bush administration official said.

During his remarks at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute Cheney referred to the Islamic extremists as 'terrorists' and said that defeating them would 'require immediate, sustained simultaneous action across multiple fronts.'

'We must move globally to get back on offense in the War on Terror,' he said. 'This means first recognizing and admitting the size and scope of the threat we face.'

Cheney said the U.S. must provide more substantially more military trainers, special operations forces, intelligence and air power to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and the military must immediately strike ISIS command centers, staging areas and lines of communication, regardless of where they are.

'ISIS does recognize a border between Syria and Iraq, so neither should we,' Cheney said.

Previewing Obama's address to the nation tonight, Cheney said that 'we can hope for and we should look for signs of a bold and immediate strategy to defeat ISIS,' but that would be a 'departure' from Obama's past actions.

'So often Obama responds to crises by saying what he will not do,' Cheney said. 'We can only hope that pattern will end tonight.' 

Instead of throwing around threats like his 'meaningless red line' in Syria, the president needs to make clear to trouble makers that misbehavior will be met with military action, Cheney said.

Foes of America in Syria and Iran 'are not impressed' with Obama's tough talk, he said, and they're ignoring his warnings.

The president's claims that Russia's recent behavior belongs to 19th century is also laughable, Cheney said.

'They play a rough game over there, and they don't much care to which century we ascribe their conduct,' Cheney cautioned.

In Russia, he said, the only concern is, Can we get away with it? If so, end of of discussion.

The former vice president said foreign friends often wonder why Obama is 'withdrawing American leadership just when it was needed most' in the world.

Obama needs to accept that America as the leader of the free world for the sake of it's allies who 'know that their security relies on American power, Cheney said. 

The former congressman, and later vice president, moved back to his native state of Wyoming after leaving office but regularly travels to Washington to speak at events.

Yesterday, he returned to his old stopping grounds on Capitol Hill to impart his wisdom on congressional Republicans.

A Washington Post article described the atmosphere as 'warm,' and the Post said Cheney received a 'rapturous reception.' It noted that two libertarian members of the Republican caucus didn't appear to be as taken with Cheney as their colleagues, though. 

Reps. Thomas Massie and Justin Amash indicated to the Post that they were none too thrilled with Cheney's calls for aggressive military action to combat terrorist threats.

'His worldview is that we should be in countries around the world and have armed forces everywhere -- and most Republicans don’t agree with that,' Amash said.

Libertarians are known for their more dovish stance on military intervention while Cheney, who was an architect of the Iraq war and Bush's War on Terror, takes an extremely hawkish approach. 

Cheney responded to Amash's critique on Wednesday, saying that those who believe the U.S. should put itself on an isolationist course are 'dead wrong.'

While a few Republican members disagreed with his perspective on foreign policy, the meet-up was otherwise a success, Cheney said.

'It was a great reception. I was impressed.'

'They never treated me that way when I was vice president,' he teased, eliciting laughter from the audience.
