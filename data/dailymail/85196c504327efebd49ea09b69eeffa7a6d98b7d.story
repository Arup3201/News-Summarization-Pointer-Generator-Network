A probe has been launched into the free nursery school milk scheme after taxpayers were cheated out of £10million a year.

Middlemen are being paid almost £1 a pint for milk - while most consumers can buy a pint for 45p.

A loophole means the Government are forced to pick up the bill, regardless of costs, submitted by firms acting on behalf of schools.

Rip-off: The Department of Health ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk

Last year it was estimated that the 
difference between the amount taxpayers were being billed and the market
 price was £10million.

Ministers are now considering setting up a system of national suppliers to cut out the middlemen.

Another suggestion is to cap the 
price that childcare providers can claim for milk. The other alternative
 is to issue e-vouchers to providers.

The Government's Nursery Milk scheme provides under fives in England, Scotland and Wales with a third of a pint every day for free.

It dates back to 1940, when milk was issued to pregnant women and young children to protect them against wartime food shortages.

But a host of 'agencies' that claim to do all of the sourcing and administration work for nurseries and schools has sprung.

They were supposed to save educational establishments time and hassle, but instead ramped up the prices.

Public Health Minister Anne Milton 
said: 'Milk has many benefits to children's health and is important for 
their development - we are committed to continuing to provide free milk 
for all under-fives.

'But the current scheme has not changed operationally since it began and costs have ballooned.

'In four years, costs have jumped 
from £27 million in 2007 to a staggering £53 million in 2011. Estimates 
show that modernising how the scheme operates could save as much as £20 
million each year.

'Everyone is encouraged to take part in this consultation and share their views on the proposed changes.'

Long history: The Government's Nursery Milk scheme, providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free, dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time

Plans to alter provision have proved politically explosive for the Conservatives in the past.

In 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron 
slapped down suggestions by Ms Milton that the supply would be scrapped,
 saying he 'did not like' the idea.

In 1971 Margaret Thatcher earned the 
nickname 'Thatcher, Thatcher milk snatcher' for ending free school milk 
for the over-sevens while education secretary.

Every child under five receives a 
third of a pint of milk free of charge at school each day and the 
nurseries claim back the cost from the Government.

Shadow public health minister Diane 
Abbott said: 'Trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up snatching
 milk away from the country's children, disproportionately affecting the
 poorest.

'In a recession, which has been made 
in Downing Street, when there is a squeeze on families, it is the wrong 
time for risks with our children's health.'

The School and Nursery Milk Alliance said that any change to milk schemes must be best for children and not financially driven.

The organisation said some of the suggestions put forward by the Government could have a negative impact on the scheme.

Jon Thornes, interim chairman of the 
organisation, said: 'Drinking milk in schools, nurseries and while in 
the care of childminders is vital in helping children to develop 
important nutrition and social habits.

'The nursery milk scheme has proven 
both incredibly popular and hugely successful in contributing to the 
healthy development of children.

'We will be engaging fully with the 
consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children 
as possible - and would urge the Government to ensure its focus is on 
children's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line.'
