The press watchdog has said it would be 'inappropriate' to open an investigation into the Sun’s publication of nude photos of Prince Harry.

The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said it was in touch with Harry’s representatives, who had not yet made a formal complaint, and that any investigation without consent could ‘pose an intrusion’ in itself.

The Sun was the only British newspaper to defy a PCC advisory note not to publish the nude photos of Harry with an unnamed woman in Las Vegas.

The UK’s biggest selling daily newspaper argued that the photos taken by party-goers with the knowledge of police protection officers were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest.

St James’s Palace appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures after they were originally published on American celebrity gossip website TMZ.

Prince Charles’s solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, wrote to the PCC asking them to make the press 'fully aware' it believed there was no public interest in newspapers publishing the photographs and that to do so would be a 'clear breach' of media regulations.

The PCC had in turn warned that publication could breach the editor’s code of practice on privacy grounds.

It said that Harry had a reasonable expectation of privacy since he was on a private holiday.

Asked whether they would, or would not, make a formal complaint to the PCC about The Sun’s publication of the images, a St James’s Palace spokesman replied: 'We are still considering matters and will make a decision in our own time.'

Commenting on their general position on the issue he said it had not changed since the pictures emerged and it was 'down to editors to make a decision about what they chose to publish'.

The Sun's move to publish the photos has drawn well over 3,000 complaints to the PCC from the general public.
