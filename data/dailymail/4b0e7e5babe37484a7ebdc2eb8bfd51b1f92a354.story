The Daily Show host Jon Stewart regularly mocks the very wealthy, but he isn’t doing too badly himself after selling one of his homes for a whopping $17.5 million – more than three times what he paid almost 10 years ago.

In 2005 the comedian bought two units - 9A and 8B - at 161 Hudson Street in the then emerging Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca.

Stewart and his wife Tracey paid $5.8 million for the units on the top two floors of the nine-story building and converted them into a 6,000-square-foot penthouse.

Like many extremely wealthy people, Jon Stewart didn't have the Manhattan property listed in his name but rather that of a limited liability company set up to secure special tax benefits

According to public records, the comedian has just offloaded the property at a massive profit.

Like many extremely wealthy people, Stewart didn't have the property listed in his name but rather that of a limited liability company set up to secure special tax benefits.

The Stanley Monkey Trust was name after his pets - his cat Stanley and his pit bull terrier Monkey. 

The lavish duplex was never publicly on the market, but old listings from when Stewart first bought it reveal that it has 40 windows, three exposures, a 600-square-foot private terrace and a 1,200-square-foot private roof deck, reports Curbed.

The prewar structure had been converted into condos in 2004 and included just 24 units. 

Actor Jeremy Piven also owns a unit in the building which had once been home to a environmental-themed nightclub called Wetlands Preserve.

Stewart gets paid about $15 million a year as host of his long-running Comedy Central show. 

Last month it was reported that NBC had offered him 'virtually anything' to step into the role of Meet the Press host, believing that he could liven up the Sunday morning political format. 

The father-of-two also owns two lakefront properties in Red Bank, New Jersey, which he purchased in 2009 and 2010 for a total of $7 million.

Tracey Stewart is a former graphic designer and vet, who now runs a Tribeca kid-friendly cafe called Moomah and is editor-in-chief of Moomah the Magazine.
