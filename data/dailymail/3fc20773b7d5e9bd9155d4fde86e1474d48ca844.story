An Ohio couple was robbed of their four puppies on Christmas morning because they had no cash to offer their burglars. 

Three men slipped through an unlocked sliding door at the northeast Ohio home at around 6 a.m. Thursday, a Wayne County sheriff's captain said.

The suspects confronted a 32-year-old man in semi-rural Chippewa Township, authorities say.

The man was struck in the face with a handgun, and a 21-year-old woman was held up at gunpoint.

When the suspects' demands for cash weren't met, the men scooped up the three-week-old Cane Corso puppies and fled. 

Cane Corsos are an Italian mastiff-type dog that can serve as watchdogs and hunters.

Capt. Doug Hunter says the puppies' chances of survival are slim because they're not yet weaned. 

The puppies' mother wasn't taken.
