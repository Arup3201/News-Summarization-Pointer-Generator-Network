Devastated: Britain's Got Talent contestant Scott Whitley looked distraught when he did not make it to the live semi-finals stage

A contestant rejected by the Britain's Got Talent judges has claimed he tried to commit suicide after failing to make it to the semi-finals of the show.

DJ Scott Whitley, from Orpington, Kent, was initially a favourite of Simon Cowell and his fellow judges with an energetic dance routine and singing he called Funkacise.

The 30-year-old said he had built up his hopes of winning so much he gave up his job as an entertainer in Lanzarote.

But he was left devastated when he failed to make the cut and attempted to take his own life while watching the live semi-final.

'I was really depressed and couldn't stop crying. I just had enough and took pills to try and end it all. Luckily I threw them up when I realised what I was doing,' he told The Daily Mirror.

The entertainer admitted he been 'naive' to stake all his dreams of achieving fame and fortune with the show, but insisted he had been given the impression he was a 'cert' to get through to the next stage by prodcuers.

Britain's Got Talent has come under increasing scrutiny this year with critics raising questions about the welfare of contestants who come under enormous pressure.

Child welfare campaigners have also raised concerns about whether younger contestants are emotionally equipped to deal with possible rejection.

One case which drew particular criticism was five-year-old Jordan Nash who progressed through the auditions.

While the youngster, from London, 
received positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he 
is too young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages 
of the competition.

Scott Whitley had thought he was a 'cert' to get through after his act went down well with hosts Ant and Dec

Singer Arisxandra Libantino, 11, 
remains in the competition and will sing in front of millions next 
weekend with £250,000 at stake.

Arisxandra burst into tears of relief as she won a tense vote during Monday’s semi-final to go through to the last ten.

But although she impressed the judges 
with her powerful singing voice, psychologists, campaigners and viewers 
all expressed concern that she wouldn’t be able to cope with the 
disappointment if she lost in the final.

It
comes only a few weeks after Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce 
Forsyth condemned talent shows for putting children through the ‘ordeal’
of competing.

Britain’s 
Got Talent judge Simon Cowell responded to those remarks after 
Arisxandra’s performance on Monday, saying: ‘If you’ve got it, you’ve 
got it. Who cares how old you are. You’re 11 years old. You’re having a 
great time, right?

Concerns have been raised about whether 11-year-old singer Arisxandra can cope with the pressure of Britain's Got Talent

In 2010 Shirlena Johnson was axed from the X Factor after she 'misled' producers over her mental illness.

The
mother performed a bizarre version of Duffy's hit song Mercy on 
Saturday's show, which saw her clawing at the floor and growling while 
dressed in tight leopard skin leggings.

But the giggling 
panel sent her through to the next round, with Simon Cowell telling her:
'I have never heard anything like that in my life. It was like a 
musical exorcism.

'What I love about you is you are fantastically nuts.'

But Miss Johnson, from East London, was later dropped  -  under rules 
introduced by producers after Susan Boyle had a breakdown on Britain's 
Got Talent  -  after she made it through the boot camp auditions to the 
judges' houses stage.

Singer Susan Boyle suffered a breakdown following the final of Britain's Got Tale in 2009

In 2009 TV watchdogs launched an investigation into the treatment of runner-up Boyle after a flood of complaints from viewers.

The Scottish singer, who has learning difficulties, was treated at a private clinic after suffering an emotional breakdown in the aftermath of the show.

Nineteen million viewers watched the beginning of Miss Boyle's meltdown as she was beaten to first place by dance group Diversity.

Within 24 hours, police officers and TV producers had forcibly escorted her to The Priory clinic in north London.

A spokesperson for Britain's Got Talent told the Mirror the show takes its duty of care 'very seriously and contestants are asked to disclose any concerns they have in advance so that we can offer appropriate support.'
