Aamir Siddiqi, 'was the victim of mistaken identity and was stabbed to death by two hitmen'

A teenage boy was stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity after two bungling hitmen went to the wrong address, a court heard today.

Aamir Siddiqi, 17, didn't stand a chance as he opened the front door and was immediately attacked by the two armed men wearing balaclavas.

The innocent teenager, who had been waiting for his Koran teacher, was brutally hacked down in a murderous attack on the doorstep of his home in Cardiff, south Wales, in April 2010.

Upon hearing the mens loud howls, the A level student's parents Iqbal and Parveen, rushed to the door to save their son's life but were themselves stabbed in the process.

Ben Hope, 39, and Jason Richards, 38, went on trial today at Swansea Crown Court charged with murder.

Both men are also each accused of two separate counts of attempted murder on the victim’s parents. They deny all charges.

Patrick Harrington QC said Hope and Richards -both heroin addicts - had gone to the wrong address.

Their intended victim lived in a similar red brick end-of-row house in a parallel road.

The men, the court heard, were paid cash for the contract killing by a third man, who can't be named for legal reasons.

The jury was told he was in dispute with intended victim Mohammed Tanhai, the owner of the house nearby, who owed the unnamed man £50,000.

'On Sunday April 11 2010, a young man, Aamir Siddiqi, was stabbed to death in the hallway of his home,' Mr Harrington said.

'His father Iqbal and his mother Parveen intervened to try to stop this murderous attack and they too were stabbed. They were unable to stop their son’s murder.'

He said the murder could be described as a 'contract killing' because the two men were recruited to carry it out.

But with 'staggering ineptitude', Hope and Richards took a wrong turn.

'Tragically for the deceased and his family, although fortunately for the intended victim, the killers went to the wrong house.'

Mr Harrington said that Hope and Richards had used a stolen Volvo car on the day of the murder, which was later found abandoned.

Upon examination, traces of the teenager's blood was found in its footwell together with Hope’s fingerprints and DNA matching Richards.

Investigators used Cardiff’s CCTV network to trace the movements of both men before and after the killing.

And evidence from mobile phones allegedly used by both men has also been used in the case against them, the court heard.

Mr Harrington said that after the brutal killing Hope and Richards were paid cash, before the alleged mistake in murdering the wrong person was revealed.

'Ben Hope went and bought himself a new pair of trainers and a laptop computer with the wages he was handed for murder.'

Within days both men were arrested and 'each defendant has contrived to create a case which blames the other', Mr Harrington added.

He told the jury that the prosecution agreed with both men to the extent that 'the killer is in the dock'.

'They are both right,' Mr Harrington added.

'Jason Richards is right when he said Ben Hope did the killing and Ben Hope is right when he said that Jason Richards did the killing.

'What happened is that they did it together.'
