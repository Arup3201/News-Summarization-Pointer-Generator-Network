From a 'health and safety' tree decorated with hazard tape and a traffic cone fairy to  one made entirely of rubbish bags, are these Britain's worst Christmas trees?

The dodgy Christmas trees, from towns and villages up and down the country, have been ridiculed as being the worst in the country for their poor decoration and non-traditional, and occasionally  bizarre design.

One town's tree was so bad that it even had it's own Facebook page - The Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree! - set up by locals in the Greater Manchester village in protest over its  spindly, sparse branches and lack of decorations.

In Mier, Stoke-on-Trent, their town Christmas tree was literally rubbish: Plastic bags collected by local schoolchildren were stacked high to create the bizarre festive offering (pictured)

In Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, the choice of decorations was described 'as something you'd find after an explosion in a rag factory' (left) while in Streatham, London, locals were left with a conical piece of white plastic with lights topped with a star and decorated with one solitary piece of tinsel and a few baubles (right)

Based on a lonely patch of grass at a crossroads, the tree nicknamed 'twiggy' was decorated with a solitary string of fairy lights until residents decided to decorate it themselves. 

But at least theirs was actually a tree.

In Mier, Stoke-on-Trent, their town Christmas tree was literally rubbish. Plastic bags collected by local schoolchildren were stacked high to create the bizarre festive offering.

In some areas, the trees were considered such a health and safety risk they were fenced off from the public.

This health-and-safety-conscious tree in north Oxford was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic and instead of an angel on top, sits a plastic traffic cone (pictured)

This unusual Christmas tree in Dymchurch, Kent, was described as a 'great big weed growing out of a stick' 

Locals in Mottram, Greater Manchester, set up a Facebook page in protest against their town tree - The Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree! - until they decide to decorate it themselves (right) while this conical tree (left) was dubbed one of the worst in the country when it appeared in Stockton-on-Tees High Street last year and has now been donated to a local charity

Christmas trees in Derby, in the Midlands, Stockton-on-Tees in Middlesborough  and Liscard in Merseyside were all surrounded by metal fences, leading to Liscard residents branding their town's festive feature an 'absolute joke' and launching a campaign to jazz up their 'depressing' tree.

But when it came to red tape, it was hard to beat the health-and-safety-conscious tree in north Oxford. Surrounded by plastic fencing, it was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic. Instead of an angel on top, sits a plastic traffic cone.

Other criticism came over trees being too bare and under decorated, non-traditional shapes and design and - in the case of one in Dymchurch, Kent, the fact it allegedly looked like 'a great big weed growing out of a stick'.

In Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, the choice of decorations was described 'as something you'd find after an explosion in a rag factory' while in Streatham, London, locals were left with a conical piece of white plastic with lights topped with a star and decorated with one solitary piece of tinsel and a few baubles.

And a conical tree, dubbed one of the worst in the country when it was placed on Stockton-on-Tees High Street last year, was so hated it has not returned but has been donated to a local charity.

People complained  trees had been fenced off from the public by a health and safety perimeter such as this conical festive offering in Derby

Brighton and Hove City Council's administration commissioned two 'recycled' trees, the first - made from old ring-binders (left)  and the second - an old library shelf, filled with flotsam and jetsam found on the beach, including a rubber glove as a 'fairy' (right)

While residents in Liscard, Merseyside, had their festive spirit dashed after seeing the underwhelming tree that has no lights and is surrounded by metal fencing on concrete blocks (pictured)

Finally, in Haddenham, Cambridgeshire locals gathered round their bizarre 'star' tree made of metal poles wrapped in tinsel
