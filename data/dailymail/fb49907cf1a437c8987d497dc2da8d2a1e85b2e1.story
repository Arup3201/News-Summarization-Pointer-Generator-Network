They say chimpanzees are the closest living evolutionary relative of humans, and in this case it proved true as heart specialists more used to carrying out procedures on people turned their attention to a 154-pound ape.

The chimp, called Goliath, was sedated at Chattanooga Zoo, in Tennessee, to allow the team of doctors and vets to monitor his heartbeat to check for signs of malfunction.

Eric Smith, an echocardiographer with at Chattanooga's Memorial Health System, carried out the procedure on the 38-year-old chimpanzee along with cardiologist Dr Bill Warren.

Veterinarian Dr Tony Ashley contacted the heart institute three years ago after the zoo's former mascot, chimpanzee Hank, died of heart disease - the number one cause of death among chimps, gorillas and orangutans living in captivity.

Dr Warren told Timesfreepress.com: 'His heart has the same measurements and valve structures as the human heart.

'If you had shown us pictures without telling us that it was a chimpanzee, we wouldn't have known the difference.'

The echocardiogram carried out on Goliath was the third carried out by the specialists from the Memorial Health System.

It is not just chimps' hearts, however, which are similar to those of humans.

It was reported this week that researchers have discovered chimpanzees also have almost the same personality traits as humans.

The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect.

The Georgia State University research also shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee.

This echoes a well-known five-factor model of the human personality, although the specific factors are slightly different.
