Emilie Gregg, pictured, claimed she had been demoted from her trader job at a Mayfair wealth management company after returning from maternity leave

A trader at a £4billion Mayfair wealth management company claims her boss greeted news she was pregnant by saying: ‘I knew something like this was going to happen.’

Emilie Gregg told a tribunal she was ‘bullied, harassed, victimised and blatantly discriminated against’ for taking maternity leave from her £150,000-a-year job. The 33-year-old trader, who worked at Troy Asset Management, also claims she was demoted after the baby was born.

‘When I told my boss Sebastian Lyon I was pregnant, his response was, “I knew something like this would happen”. I felt as though I had done something wrong,’ she told an employment tribunal.

‘I was told he did not like my attitude and I was pretty ungrateful.’

She claimed the company sexually discriminated against her by failing to give her details of a maternity policy until three months after she announced  her pregnancy.

Troy Asset Management, which handles a £4billion portfolio, denies her allegations. It accuses her of exaggerating the facts and ‘telling untruths’.

Mrs Gregg, who lives with husband Simon, a luxury car dealer, in a £3.5million mews house in Chelsea, said she started working for the firm as a PA in May 2009.

She became portfolio administrator and then rose to head of dealing, earning £65,000 plus a £85,000 bonus.

She announced her pregnancy in October 2011 and went on maternity leave in March 2012. She claimed that during her leave she was demoted to portfolio administrator during a reorganisation.

In October 2012 she went to see her bosses to say she would be returning to work after a full year, in April 2013.  ‘I thought they would be pleased to know I intended to return, but I was met with stunned silence,’ said Mrs Gregg.

‘I was told during the meeting, “Things have changed greatly since you left”.’

The firm had restructured its business to create a role called head of execution – taking over some of Mrs Gregg’s responsibilities – which was given to an outside candidate, the tribunal heard.

Mrs Gregg said she found out the details of the reorganisation only five days before she was due to return to work. ‘I thought the unpleasantness from my maternity leave had been left behind. I was wrong,’ she said. ‘I was frankly devastated.

‘All I wanted was to be treated fairly and be allowed to return to the role I had worked so hard to hold.’

Daniel Stilitz QC, representing Troy at the hearing in central London, said the title ‘head of dealing’ was one Mrs Gregg had given herself and the company, ‘perhaps unwisely’, did not bother to change it. He claimed her evidence was littered with factual errors and inconsistencies.  

‘There was no suggestion Mrs Gregg was being forced out, that was a misunderstanding,’ he said. ‘The firm wanted her to return to her role at the end of her leave.’ The hearing continues.
