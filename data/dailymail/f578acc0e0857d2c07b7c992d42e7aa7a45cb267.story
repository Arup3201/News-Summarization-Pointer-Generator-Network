Babies as young as five-months-old are attending weekly classes where they learn maths, English and foreign languages in a bid to stimulate their brains. 

Shichida, a Japanese program with schools in Victoria and Sydney, has an average student age of 18-months.

The education program aims to stimulate the right side, or the creative side, of their pupil's brains by presenting them with numerous flashcards - printed with numbers, world flags and even classical art - for less than one second at a time.

Babies as young as five-months-old are attending weekly classes at Shichida, a Japanese program with schools in Victoria and Sydney, where they learn maths, English and foreign languages 

'It's meant to be like they're watching TV; they're just not thinking too much about it, they're relaxed, just watching and absorbing it,' Hanako Ward, a Shichida teacher, said

'It's meant to be like they're watching TV; they're just not thinking too much about it, they're relaxed, just watching and absorbing it,' Hanako Ward, a teacher at one of the learning centres told A Current Affair (ACA).

'They might not be able to say "that's [the number] ten" right away, but eventually it will connect in their minds.

'We aren't trying to create little geniuses; we want them to love learning'.

While some people may be dubious about the effectiveness of the program, Ms Ward claimed that many parents had attested to seeing results, even thanks to the placards of famous artworks.

'Mums have mentioned to me that their child has pointed at a postcard or painting and recognised it and said "that's Picaso",' she said.

The program's participants include the likes of 16-month-old Jyla, who has been attending the classes since she was five-months-old and speaks bits of Spanish, English and French at home

'I think we underestimate what babies can absorb and their intelligence and I think that they are very ready. It's great, it can't do any harm and she loves it,' one student's mother, Kiera, said 

The program's participants include the likes of 16-month-old Jyla, who has been attending the classes since she was five-months-old and speaks bits of Spanish, English and French at home.

'This is obviously helping her and we put her against other children and she's doing a lot better than those other children her age,' her father, Khan, said.

Similarly, Tara has also been attending since she was five-months-old and speaks Greek, English Tibetan and Spanish at home.

'I think we underestimate what babies can absorb and their intelligence and I think that they are very ready. It's great, it can't do any harm and she loves it,' her mother Kiera told ACA.

The centre's superstar, Nathan, is an astonishing example who at the age of 18-months can already count to 30 in English and ten in Mandarin

'If they like it they like it, if they don’t they don’t. My view is never to pressure or push. You just introduce and if they take to it that’s great,' Nathan's mother Melita said.

Shiao-Ling Lim, Shichida's Australian Principal and Managing Director denied that the early education school promoted 'Tiger Mums'.

Coined by author Amy Chua, whose disciplinary rules include no sleepovers, no play dates, no television and no grades under an A, a Tiger Mum practices strict parenting methods which enforce competitive learning at the expense of a child's social life.

But Ms Lim assures that the method has nothing to do with Shichida and claims she wants to tell Tiger Mums to 'relax'.

'Children, they can be self-motivated to want to learn, they can love learning. They do not need to be forced,' she said.

'The first three years are really important because up to 80 per cent of the brain is basically developed by the time your three-years-old,' Shiao-Ling Lim, Shichida's Australian Principal and Managing Director said

But the extra education does not just stop in the early years. Primary school students as young as kindergarten students are attending two hour after-school tuition classes up to twice a week to improve their chances of making it into a selective school

'We have kids who are suffering from severe anxiety disorders at the age of 4 or 5 because they are being asked to do things they are not developmentally ready for,' Michael Nagel, an expert in child brain development, said

'The first three years are really important because up to 80 per cent of the brain is basically developed by the time your three-years-old.'

But the extra education does not just stop in the early years. Primary school students from as early as kindergarten are attending two hour after-school tuition classes up to twice a week to improve their chances of making it into a selective high school.

But while the children interviewed by ACA were adamant that they could easily manage the extra work load, associate professor and expert in child brain development Michael Nagel, said that elevated stress levels in children could hinder their ability to learn.

'We have kids who are suffering from severe anxiety disorders at the age of four or five because they are being asked to do things they are not developmentally ready for,' he said.

'This notion that somehow you can hyper stimulate or improve a child's brain in the early years by getting them to do certain things has not been supported by any evidence.'

Instead, Mr Nagel said that similar results can be achieved by parents simply dedicating their time to their children.

'You need to spend time with your children, you need to read with them, you need to talk with them, you need to enjoy the world around you with them,' he told ACA.
