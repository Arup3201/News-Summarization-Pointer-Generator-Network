Suspect: One Goh has lost 20lbs in jail since going on hunger strike after his arrest

A former nursing student accused of killing seven people in a Christian college shooting rampage has gone on hunger strike in jail.

One Goh, 43, is suspected of gunning down seven people at the small Oikos University in Oakland, California.

But following his arrest, the mass shooting suspect, who was said to have felt 'disrespected' by fellow students, has not eaten since his arrival at Santa Rita jail in Dublin, California.

Goh, who has a history of violence, has lost 20lbs (9kg) since arriving at the jail on April 3, and has now been moved to its infirmary.

The South Korean has been charged with seven counts of murder and three of attempted murder following the devastating rampage which left six students and a receptionist dead.

Goh, who also left three others wounded after the spree, has yet to enter a plea following the charges.

Police believe that Goh had been looking for a female administrator who expelled him earlier this year, when he carried out his plan to 'inflict pain' on the school.

The coroner's office named the victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito.

Grace Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro and male victim Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, also died.

The school's receptionist Kathleen Ping, 24, of Oakland, was also shot and killed, her family said.

Goh allegedly arrived at the school on the morning of Monday April 2 with a .45 caliber handgun looking for the administrator.

Held: One Goh has been kept at Santa Rita jail in Dublin, California, since being arrested in connection with the deadly shooting rampage in Oakland earlier this month

Investigation: Swat teams arrive at the school where seven people were murdered in Oakland, California,

Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California

Smiles: Originally from Newark, California, Ms Kim was one of the six women killed in the Oakland shooting

When he discovered that she was not in the building, he went into an acupuncture class and forced the students to stand up. He told them: 'Get in line and I'm going to kill you all.'

According to authorities, Goh opened fire when people would not listen to his instructions.

'Not everyone was cooperative, and that's when he began shooting,' said Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan.

Police said that none of the victims were the ones who teased Goh.

'He was upset that students in the past, when he attended the school, mistreated him,' Howard said.

Second victim: Lydia Sim, 21, was also killed in Monday's attack and she was a nursing student at Oikos University

'They disrespected him, laughed at him. They made fun of his lack of English speaking skills. It made him feel isolated compared to the other students.

'He was having, we believe, some behavioral problems at the school and was asked to leave several months ago.'

The suspect sprayed bullets randomly at his classmates before he went through the entire building systematically shooting people.

A professor who taught Goh said the nursing student used to brag about violence.

Professor Romie John Delariman met Goh at the beginning of his nursing course at Oikos University.

The professor said Goh repeatedly told a story about beating up someone who tried to mug him in San Francisco. Goh also added that when he was bored, he would go to the park and pick fights.

The school has since tried to move on from the horrific slayings, as students at the Christian college returned to class yesterday.

Oikos University, which still has a memorial banner displayed, along with wreaths and flower bouquets, held a single English-as-a-second-language class three weeks after the shooting rampage which killed seven.

The small school in an industrial area of the city has been busy preparing to resume operations by replacing carpeting and removing bloodstains and bullet scars.

Lucas Garcia, who taught Monday's class, was in the building at the time of the shootings. He has been spending time getting in touch with students since the attack and believes it's important to come back to campus and move on.

'They feel very scared and are dealing with a lot of emotions about what happened,' Garcia said. 'They're dealing with symptoms of a very traumatic experience.'

Wrong place: Sonam Chodon was in the acupuncture class when the shooter began firing indiscriminately on Monday morning

Missed: Victim Lydia Sim, 21, is seen here with her 19-year-old brother Daniel who said that his sister was an independent and caring nursing student just one year shy of graduation
