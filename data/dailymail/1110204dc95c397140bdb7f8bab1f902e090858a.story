A 13-year-old boy is being held by police after a shooting threat was made at a Gold Coast school.

Miami High School went into lockdown around 11:40am after several students received threatening text messages this morning.

Police wearing bullet proof vests swarmed the school.

There were scenes of panic out the front earlier this afternoon as anxious parents received messages from their children.

One mother told Seven News she received a text message from her daughter which said: 'We are hiding under tables and I heard a scream.' 

In an attempt to allay fears, the Queensland Police Service issued a statement earlier this afternoon which said: 'Please be advised that there has NOT been a shooting at a Miami High School.'

'Police have responded following a threat that was received and are currently on scene conducting enquiries.' 

Police and media helicopters buzzed the school 

Concerned parents have rushed to the scene of the school after reports of the shooting threat

The school posted a reassuring message on its website. 'Can I stress that all students are safe and police are on school grounds investigating,' the school wrote.

'The police have requested that all students and parents resist using social media during this time. 

'Once again I wish to emphasise that all students are safe and their safety remains our top priority.' 

The lockdown was lifted around 3pm and students streamed from the school to waiting parents. 

Police said investigations are continuing.
