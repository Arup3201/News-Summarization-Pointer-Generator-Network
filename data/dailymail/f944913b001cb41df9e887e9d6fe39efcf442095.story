The father of a high school football star fatally stabbed in an argument moments after graduating started the fight, according to police.

Isayah Muller, 19, died 
after an argument in the Bronx, New York, over an alleged theft of 
fragrances from his family’s car during the ceremony.

His
father, 40-year-old Andre Muller, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon 
and assault and pleaded not guilty.

Dead: Isayah Muller, 19, died after a fight in the Bronx, New York, over whether something was stolen from his family's car during his graduation ceremony

Speaking to Fox 5 News Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said: 'What a tragedy. [Andre] Muller was the aggressor.'

'He [Andre] struck one of the attendants whom I believe is still in the hospital.

'He assaulted the attendant. He picked up a shovel and struck the attendant.

'Another attendant had a shank, which is a homemade knife. The young man also participated in the assault and was stabbed.'

Star running back Isayah, known as ‘Zayah’ to friends, led his team to the Public Schools Athletic League championship last year.

The family arrived at the car park on Tuesday morning and walked to a campus for the graduation of Harry S. Truman High School students.

They headed back to the car after the ceremony and just after they left to go for dinner Mr Muller noticed something was missing, police said.

An argument erupted between Isayah's father and parking attendants and he accused them of stealing something from the car, police said.

A source told the New York Daily News the allegedly stolen items were ‘expensive fragrances’ worth up to $200.

Isayah and Mr Muller ran to the family car where his mother and girlfriend were waiting and they drove him to a clinic and later a hospital.

He was pronounced dead at the hospital on Tuesday evening.

His father has been charged and police are trying to determine what kind of a weapon he allegedly possessed.

The parking attendants were being questioned.

Car park officials have not yet commented and it is not clear how many attendants were involved or who delivered the fatal blow.

The American footballer rushed for 285 yards during the high school championship game in November, winning 23-20 over Beach Channel.

His performance was the talk of newspapers and television, and he was revered by his team-mates and coach.

Well-liked: Isayah's coach said he was the 'best back I've ever seen' in 12 years of coaching and was destined to go professional and reach the NFL

‘Isayah Muller is the type of player who steps up when the game is on the line,’ Truman coach John-James Shepherd said after the winning game.

His coach told the New York Daily News 
last night that he was ‘best back I’ve ever seen’ in 12 years of 
coaching and was destined to reach the NFL.

‘To
him, there's no such thing as pressure. You put the ball his hands and it's like he's in a zone. You look in his eyes and there's no reflection. He just gets the ball and does what he has to do'

Team quarterback Xavier Hamilton (speaking after game)

Team quarterback Xavier Hamilton said Muller was the team's go-to guy.

‘To him, there's no such thing as pressure,’ Hamilton told ESPN's high school report. ‘You put the ball his hands and it's like he's in a zone.

‘You look in his eyes and there's no reflection. He just gets the ball and does what he has to do.’

Muller ran the last five plays of the November game – and according to ESPN, ‘he not only carried the ball, but also his entire team’.

Isayah, who stood at 5’10” and weighed 180lbs, said he ‘wasn’t tired’ after the match and could play ‘the whole game all over again’.
