One Direction’s Liam Payne has said the group has ‘a lot of growing up to do’, following his bandmates’ apparent use of illegal drugs.

In the first sign of an apology after Mail Online's exclusive video emerged of members Louis Tomlinson, 22, and Zayn Malik, 21, smoking a ‘joint’ in Peru, Payne suggested things had gone ‘a little sideways’.

He tweeted: 'I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways I apologise for that.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Apology: Liam Payne, 20, tweeted a full statement on behalf of Zayn and Louis apologising for the 'joint' video

'We are only in our 20's we all do stupid things at this age.

'We
 all have a lot of growing up to do in an extreme circumstance I'm not 
making excuse but it's fact we are gunna fall short somewhere.

'Hopefully
 we stand the test of time an get it right in the end I don't take this 
for granted and I'm extremely grateful to be here doing this.

'Thank you to everyone who has stuck with us through this just know that we love you guys for it and it means the world.'

His words come after Harry Styles hit 
out at his bandmates Louis and Zayn for their ‘reckless and stupid’ 
behaviour in the now infamous 'joint' video.

Harry
 is said to be annoyed with them for potentially jeopardising the band’s
 upcoming 39-date United States tour after the film showed them sharing a
 suspicious roll-up in Peru last month.

'Joint
 lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up 
cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last
 month

Hit
 maker: Zayn takes a draw on the roll up. Before they began their 
journey someone can be heard asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband 
in this?'

Warm up: Louis can be heard joking that 'Mary J' is 'one
 very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up'

Happy daze: At one point during the video, Louis asks: 'How is it Zayn?' Pausing a beat before he exhales Zayn replies: 'Nice'. Zayn blows smoke at the camera and says: 'I know you like dat, bro'

Controversial: In
 MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting
 on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s 
green only, Nig.’

Louis and Zayn, who did not mention the 
indiscretion during a sell-out concert in Sunderland this week, could 
be banned from the United States by immigration authorities.

It has also emerged Harry has chosen to fly in a different private jet to Zayn because he does not like his smoking, a source said.

An insider told The Sun: ‘Harry is 
annoyed about the whole debacle,' and revealed how the singer thought it
 was ‘stupid and reckless’ of the pair to film their actions on camera.

Flying solo: Separate jets for Harry and his increasingly estranged bandmates this month. Does it mean that some members of the boy band can't stand each other?

Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band

The source also revealed how, despite his reputation, Harry, 20, is in fact ‘professional and mature’ and does not approve of such antics which he fears could now overshadow the band's success.

‘This should be one of the biggest weeks of the band’s career with the launch of their UK stadium tour. Instead it has been taken over by this controversy,' the insider added.

It comes as Louis’ father said he was ‘worried’ for his son after watching the footage - which was filmed on April 27 as the pair were escorted by car to a show at the Estadio Nacional in Lima, Peru, where they performed to a 40,000-strong crowd.
