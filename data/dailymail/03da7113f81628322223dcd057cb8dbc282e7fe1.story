Wearing colourful baggy trousers, and smiling widely behind his face paint, Bozo the clown appears in front of a group of school children and cries: 'Do you want to play?'

He looks just like an innocent entertainer but second later 'Bozo' screeches like a maniac and - as the pupils flee in horror - chases them into a nearby park brandishing a gun and a sharpened stick.

This is no Halloween prank, but the face of a disturbing new trend sweeping America and Europe: clown terror attacks inspired by US serial killer Twisty the Clown. 

For the first time MailOnline can reveal who is behind the macabre craze - a 19-year-old butcher's apprentice who developed a sinister obsession with the circus act.

Teenager Thomas Van Becelaert, who now has a criminal conviction for premeditated violence with a weapon, marauded through the town of Douvrin, northern France.

He is one of dozens of students, teenagers and schoolchildren as young as 14 who have become consumed by the 'evil clown' phenomenon.

The mania has escalated to such a degree that vigilante mobs have formed in France to chase away the clowns and the village of Vendargues, in the south of the country, has just placed an official ban on ‘evil clowns’.

Mayor Bruno Giraudo said: ‘It's about protecting children by preventing ill-intentioned clowns threatening residents.’

The sinister movement started in the US, mainly thanks to TV series called ‘American Horror Story: Freak Show’, which centres on the serial killer Twisty the Clown.

The fictional character stalks couples with scissors and imprisons children in an old school bus.

Now however it has spread to Europe, where police in France have been forced to issue a warning against vigilante mobs, stating: 'Any person, aggressive clowns or hunters of clowns, discovered in possession of a weapon on the highway will be arrested.'

Police arrested 14 teenagers dressed as clowns and carrying weapons in the Mediterranean port town of Agde on October 25.

But because they are underage they cannot be identified - and Van Beclaert is the only attacker who can be named and shamed so far. 

He had a record for ‘minor offences’ around his home town, and had developed a ‘fascination’ with clowns, said a legal source close to the case.

The source added: ‘He became obsessed with this craze. It started off as a means of bullying younger kids, which is bad enough, but it has turned into something even more sinister.’

Van Becelaert himself, who got away with a six month suspended sentence, 105 hours community service, and a ban on carrying any kind of weapon for five years, said: ‘I know it wasn’t funny, I’m just really sorry.’

Sinister: The craze started in California, while in Britain a clown was spotted in Northampton (above) but did not terrorise children. Police in France have now issued an appeal against vigilante mobs

Armed: At a court appearance Thomas Van Becelaert confessed to carrying an air pistol that looked like a live ammunition gun to target children 

During his appearance at a court in Béthune last week, Van Becelaert admitted heading out at twilight on a Friday night in early October.

He was wearing a wig, burnt cork smeared across his face, and multi-coloured clothing picked up in a novelty shop.

An air pistol looking just like a live ammunition gun and the heavy stick were his chosen arms.

Despite Van Becelaert’s apology, and his considerable efforts to avoid identification in court, the so-called 'Clowns of the North' gang to which he belonged continue to cause terror across the region. 

They carry anything they can lay their hands on – from chainsaws and axes to knives and baseball bats.

Fake blood and dummies are often used to make the attacks even more chilling.

Van Becelaert would not expand on what motivated his crimes, but his tearful mother, Christelle Van Becelaert, was prepared to offer her version of events.

‘My son disguised himself as a clown as joke for his mates,’ she told MailOnline. ‘He went out, unarmed, without anything.

‘He picked up a stick in the park, where there were a lot of young people. He made them scared, that’s certain, but he had no weapon with him, never.’

Referring to the owner of a fast food van who confronted her son, Mrs Van Becelaert said: ‘The chip fryer came round to our house with a weapon. It was then that my son panicked and returned home.

‘I’ve got an airgun that fires tear gas pellets. My son was scared so he went out with it, but there was no premeditation.’

Mrs Van Becelaert claimed Thomas was being punished unfairly.

‘My fear is that he is suffering because of what all the other clowns have been doing,’ she said.

However, Mrs Van Becelaert conceded: ‘I want to shake him, to make him understand that he shouldn’t have done that to kids.’

She admits that the first person her son came across was a six-year-old living next door, and he is still traumatised by what he saw.

The chilling events in Douvrin, not far from France’s border with Belgium, have been replicated dozens of times in recent weeks.

Police have stepped up patrols in a bid to clamp down on the craze, one which has led to a series of disturbing attacks.

The Clowns of the North have their own Facebook page, with a main page reading: ‘Just for Fun’.

A member who lives in the town of Amiens, and who asked solely to be referred to as Gilles, said: ‘It’s a cool craze which comes from America – it’s the mixture of fun and mischief which really appeals to us.

‘We stand there with balloons and a happy look on our face and then – bang – we’re scaring people out of their skins!

‘It does no real harm – the fake weapons used aren’t meant to hurt anyone. We’d much rather just make a funny video and stick it online’.

Creepy: The trend spread to Northampton where budding film-maker Alex Powell posted images of himself on Facebook - but insisted he was not harming anyone 

But Thierry Alonso, the director of public safety in the Pas-de-Calais region, said Van Becelaert’s arrest and conviction should send out the right message.

‘This kind of behaviour just isn’t acceptable,’ said Mr Alonso. ‘There’s been a domino effect, with lots of people getting involved all over France. When there is aggression, real or simulated, this behaviour just isn’t allowed.’

Mr Alonso said a lot of the worst violence happened when people fought back. There have already been a number of vigilante attacks.

In Montpellier, a fake clown beat someone up with an iron bar, while drivers in the city have complained of ‘very scary clowns’ threatening them.

A French video of a man dressed as a clown pretending to club people to death in front of terrified passers-by has had almost 30 million hits.

Twisty the Clown, from the US series American Horror Story, is known to have influenced France's fake clowns.

So too has the case of American serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy, who was executed in 1994 for murdering 33 people.

Gacy regularly dressed up as a funny man for children’s parties, and became known as the ‘Killer Clown’.

‘There nothing fun about any of this,’ said one of the police officers who dealt with Van Becelaert’s case. 'It’s a sinister craze, and it’s getting out of hand.'

Last year Northampton became the focus of a clown craze when budding filmmaker Alex Powell dressed as a clown and posted pictures of himself on Facebook. However, he said the pranks were intended to amuse people and did not terrorise children.
