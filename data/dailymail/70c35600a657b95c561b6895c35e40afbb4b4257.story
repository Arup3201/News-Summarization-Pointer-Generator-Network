An ex-convict who married two women shot them both dead after a row erupted in the house they all shared.

Thug Levent Eren Ser, 33, gunned them down at his home in the city of Izmit, north-eastern Turkey, after he caught his first wife Fadime Ser, 20, shouting at second wife Inci Ates, 20, whom he married in an illegal religious ceremony.

As the two began arguing Ser pulled out a hunting rifle and gunned them both down before going on the run.

Fadime was taken to hospital where she later died.

Ates was killed on the spot.

He was caught two hours later hiding in a pine grove not far from the house.

Neighbour Omer Tahir, 45, said: 'He was an unpleasant piece of work who thought he was something special.

'He was rude to everyone, especially to his two women, and treated them no better than cows.'

Following his arrest a police spokesman said: 'He was previously in jail for wounding a man. This time he'll get life.'

The shooting follows a conference in the western city of Istanbul organised to discuss the problem of women who are abused by their husbands.

Female activists, public figures and politicians said that women who suffer domestic violence do not have the government's protection and there were only 70 shelters available in the whole of Turkey.

The government has now pledged to try and clamp down on domestic violence and to provide women with greater protection.
