Rebecca Rivers, 21, is accused of punching her landlord Peter Edwards in the chest during an argument despite knowing he had a heart condition

A young woman who punched a heart patient in the chest triggering a fatal seizure has gone on trial for manslaughter.

Rebecca Rivers, 21, landed several blows in Peter Edwards’ chest despite being fully aware of his delicate medical condition, it is alleged.

As a result the 64-year-old slumped to the floor clutching his chest and begged for his angina spray to ease the pain.

But just moments later after he suffered a fatal heart attack and died, telling his wife: 'It’s not working, I’m going.'

Rivers denies manslaughter at the flat they shared in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, in November last year.

Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Edwards’ medical problems first began in 2000 when he suffered a heart attack.

He made a good recovery and quickly went back to work, while relying on medication.

But he soon became worse again and by 2011 he was beginning to experience more chest pain and was having to rely on his medication more regularly.

In 2012 Rivers moved in with Mr Edwards and his wife Sandra. His health deteriorated even further and he was prescribed a special spray to relieve the symptoms of angina.

He used the spray at times of stress, and was due to have a heart operation in December last year.

Fiona Elder, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Edwards’ heart condition was not a secret. When there were arguments it would often cause Mr Edwards to use his spray.

'Rebecca Rivers was told he needed a heart operation and was told her arguments set off his heart problems.'

The court heard that during an argument in September last year, Mr Edwards collapsed in front of Rivers, needing his medication.

Mrs
 Edwards told the court she warned Rivers a number of times arguments in
 the flat were not fair on her husband, due to the stress on his heart.

Mr Edwards' wife, Sandra, said the couple asked Rivers to leave their home because she was abusive. Mrs Edwards told the court that Rivers began shouting, before punching Mr Edwards in the chest

Mrs Edwards told the jury at Bristol Crown Court that she explained her husband's condition to Rivers, and told her to stop arguing with him because it made his heart problems worse

But Mrs Edwards said Rivers became abusive again on November 5 last year after being told to leave the home because of her aggression, shouting at Mr Edwards: 'Go on, hit me! Go on, hit me!'

The jury was told Mr Edwards replied: 'I’ve never hit a woman in my life. Why would I start now?'

Mrs Edwards said Rivers then punched her husband several times in the chest.

She told the court: 'Pete clutched his chest. He said "I want you to ring the police, I want a restraining order on her, I don’t know what she’ll do next".'

Sobbing, Mrs Edwards continued: 'He asked for his spray. He used it. He collapsed on the floor. He said "It’s not working, I’m going".'

Mr Edwards was taken to hospital but died at Bristol Royal Infirmary on November 10. The trial continues.
