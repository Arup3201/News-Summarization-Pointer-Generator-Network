Jimmy Savile's best friend and his 
personal assistant for more than 30 years has suggested alleged 
child abuse victims are making the claims up.

Janet
Cope, 70, refused to accept the former DJ was guilty of any of the 
sexual abuse claims and inferred alleged victims were motivated by 
money.

Speaking at her home in Aylesbury, Bucks, she told The Daily Star: 'Why have all these people shut up for 40 years? I just think they are jumping on the bandwagon. I think they know what 
money is.'

Mrs Cope, who was given away by Savile at her wedding in 1990, added: 'You know people suddenly become fanciful when something like this happens.

'They think, "Oh, I'll have a little bit of this, I'll say I was groped
or something", when all that happened was he put his arm around you and
had a photograph taken.'

She
met Savile while doing charity work at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 
1971, the hospital where it is claimed Savile abused young children.

She
suggested to the newspaper that the reason Savile was often pictured 
with young women was because he thought it would help preserve his 
youthful image.

The comments came after photographs 
were released of Savile visiting sick and disabled children in hospital 
wards, around the time he was alleged to have abused patients.

Mrs Cope, who was Savile's personal assistant for 32 years, added: 'These kids thrown themselves at celebrities, the celebrities don't go looking for it.'

It was claimed the NHS hospital where the pair met knew 30 years ago that Savile was a threat but chiefs allowed him to boast he had his own bedroom and 'lived' there for two decades.

Nurses even resorted to warning youngsters to ‘pretend to be asleep’ when the warped Jim’ll Fix It star was approaching their wards, it was alleged.

Teenagers in wheelchairs and others recovering from cancer were among those allegedly attacked by the sick BBC DJ during his time volunteering as a hospital porter.

One patient claimed he was fondled in Savile’s Rolls-Royce at a Stoke Mandeville fundraiser when he was just nine, and two women said Savile had forcibly kissed them when they were in their early teens.

Mrs Cope denied accusations he molested disabled children at a string of charity events.
