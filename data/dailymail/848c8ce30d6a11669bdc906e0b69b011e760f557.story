It might not sound like the best way to digest your food, but this is the restaurant to visit if you want your food delivered by rollercoaster.

Diners tucking into dinner at Rogo's in Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, will have their orders served not by waiters, but via 30 tracks running throughout its dining room, with a 12-metre, tornado-shaped gigantic spiral that gets narrower from top to bottom. 

Each table in the restaurant has its own individually designed rollercoaster track and a unique silent delivery system that sees food make a gravity-defying 360-degree journey to tables. 

Dining with a twist: Diners wait for their meal which will race down on of the 30 tracks 

Customers are shown to their table before they order their meal on a tablet. The order then slides to the kitchen via a mini transport conveyor before arriving at a bank of chefs.

Food is then cooked before being placed in a pod – which is where the fun starts.

An elevator carefully lifts the food pod to the start of the track before the gently releasing it on to a coaster track. 

The coasters have several loops, some which run parallel and other which run in opposite directions.

Each place setting is outfitted with a tablet which customers can use to order their meal 

The meals then whizz down on of the 30 tracks flying overhead, swirling down and looping past diners to arrive piping hot and ready to be eaten. 

The 360-seater establishment, which opened in November last year, has three lift systems and two transport conveyors from the kitchen to the dispatch area.

The coaster themselves have one double loop, one parallel double loop and a twisting tornado slide that is approximately 12 metres in height.

The two-floor 14,000-square foot restaurant has an international menu with dishes such as American fried chicken, beef stroganoff, thyme-crusted salmon, British fish pie and French cassoulet.

Unique delivery system: Chefs will cook your food and then place your order in pods, before your meal runs down the tracks and arrives at your table

On its website it states: ‘Yumminess is traveller and it doesn’t take bland and ordinary journeys. It hitchhikes with your appetites. 

'It takes road trips with your taste buds. And it get an adrenaline rush on a roller coaster of mouth-watering flavours.

The statement ends with: ‘Because here, the truly delicious doesn’t need a passport. It can take a trip anywhere – including one straight to your tummy.’ 

Jessica Wadih Al-Absi, chairman and chief executive of JWA Group, the restaurant’s operator, told Gulf Business: ‘Each table has its own individually designed rollercoaster track and a unique silent delivery system that thrills diners as they get to watch their food make a gravity-defying 360-degree journey to their table.

'Our technology makes dining fun as it transports both cold and hot food and drinks along the multi spiral, double loop and tornado tracks.'

She added: ‘Each dish is presented in individual pots, making it a real journey of discovery from start to finish, and one that we know will resonate with children and fun-loving adults alike.’
