Perfect storm: Sam Harper Brighouse died following a reaction to Ibuprofen and sports supplements during the Brighton Marathon

A fit and healthy young man died following a ‘perfect storm’ reaction to sports supplements and Ibuprofen during a marathon.

Former public schoolboy Sam Harper Brighouse fell ill about 16 miles into the Brighton Marathon on April 14.

From that point, a coroner said 'there was nothing that could have been done to save him'.

The biology graduate from London, described as being ‘fit as a fiddle’, died of bowel ischaemia and a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage.

Bowel ischaemia can lead to a 75 per cent loss of blood flow to the bowel.

The 23-year-old had taken two or four Ibuprofen tablets during the race, as well as sports supplements, but his preparation was described as 'entirely sensible'.

At an inquest into his death, Brighton and Hove Coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said the combination of circumstances 'have never been recorded before'.

The cause of death was contributed to
by an ‘idiosyncratic reaction’ to hyperthermia, dehydration, endurance 
exertion, hyperosmolar sports supplements and ibuprofen, and his potassium levels were three times higher than normal levels.

The inquest heard that he also used an inhaler for asthma but the coroner ruled that this did not contribute to his death.

Describing his body’s reaction, Ms Hamilton-Deeley said it was a ‘perfect storm’ situation.

‘From the point of his collapse there was nothing that could have been done to help Sam,' she said.

‘There is no evidence that any other death has occurred in the same circumstances as Sam’s did.’

Recording
a verdict of misadventure, she added: ‘Sam died as a result of a 
combination of complications arising on a background of endurance sport.

'This combination has never been recorded before and may never be recorded again.'

‘Sam
was unique in life and he remains unique in his death. His intent was 
to undertake to run the Brighton Marathon and prepared entirely 
sensibly.

Fit as a fiddle: The 23-year-old's death was described by the coroner as unique. The young man did not 'indulge in risky behaviour'

'He didn’t indulge in any risky behaviour. The products he used to support him were recognised and recommended.

‘Everything
that Sam did was entirely appropriate and yet events took an unexpected
and unintended turn which led to his death. This is a definition of 
misadventure.’

Mr Brighouse was an ex-pupil of the £15,800-a-year Alleyn’s School, in Dulwich, South East London, and later studied at Sheffield University.

He had been participating in the marathon to raise money for a charity supporting Aids orphans.

Speaking
after the inquest, Mr Harper Brighouse’s family called on marathon 
runners to be careful when taking sports supplements.

His
uncle Robert Brighouse said: 'We would like to thank all the people who 
attended to Sam after he collapsed. He was cared for by extraordinarily 
kind, compassionate people who could not have done more or tried harder 
to keep him alive.

'Sam’s 
death was described by the coroner as extraordinarily rare, but it is a 
tragic reminder that participation in any endurance event and taking 
gels and analgesics to help you get through it carry a level of risk, no
matter how fit you are or how hard you train.

'The
endurance sports industry is still relatively new and we are all still 
learning about how the body copes and reacts to what we put it through 
and feed it.

'We would urge
all those involved in the industry to do what they can to ensure that 
everyone who participates does so knowing what they need to do and take 
to make the experience unforgettable for all the right reasons.'
