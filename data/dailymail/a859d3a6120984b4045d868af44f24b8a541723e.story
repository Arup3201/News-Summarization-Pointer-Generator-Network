The small southern Utah town of Hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend.

The sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for Barista's restaurant, and owner Stephen Ward said he woke up Friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors.

Hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable, cone-shaped feature had asked the city council to revoke Barista's business license.

Hurricane, Utah, restaurant Barista's cased an uproar after displaying a bull on its sign with over-sized genitalia (left). On Friday owner Stephen Ward decided to remove (right) the genitalia that caused such a disturbance in the town

Ward told the St. George Spectrum on Saturday that he made it clear to city officials before he altered the statue that he wasn't bowing to community pressure.

'I told them I am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints. I don't like you. I'm doing it for me,' Ward told. 'I just decided it would look better without the weenie. And oh my God! It's beautiful.'

Even before the battle over the bull, tensions had been running high between Ward and the local community just north of the Arizona border.

Customers have said the food is too expensive, alleged that Ward is hostile and has poor business practices. He says his offerings are the best in the region and hasn't hesitated to push back.

The dispute got physical on March 14, when an altercation erupted between a Barista's employee and a patron. 

The patron was cited for a number of misdemeanors, including assault, according to the Hurricane City Police Department. 

Though Ward received an onslaught of criticism for the bull, he insists that he is not removing the genitalia for the community, but because he 'just decided it would look better'

Ward, however, said the incident wasn't handled appropriately and is upset that the patron wasn't arrested.

The copper bull's over-sized genitalia reinvigorated the fight. After a steady stream of complaints, city officials were evaluating whether there were grounds to force the removal or modification of the bull. 

City Manager Clark Fawcett said the sign was approved by the planning department and Ward went through the proper channels, but: 'the dimensions of certain parts of the animal don't seem to be built the same way as in the plan that came to us.'

More than 500 people  signed the petition asking the council strip restaurant of its business licence.

According to the petition: 'As a member of the Hurricane City council has already said, Barista's has given Hurricane, UT a "black eye".

'It's owner is a terrible representation of what our community stands for. He takes advantage of every person that walks into his restaurant.

'They intentionally take excessive advantage of those that are visiting our community from other parts of the world.

Ward (pictured) has had more than one clash with residents of Hurricane, but he said this recent conflict hasn't hurt business

'They have a horrible reputation that shines a bad light on the rest of Hurricane, UT. We as a community will not stand aside and allow this false representation be made!'

Local resident Denise Mackelprang told The St George News: 'It looks terrible. I could see the bull, but not the details of the sex. It’s R-rated to me, especially with young school kids seeing it and talking about it.'

Fellow resident Lindsay Knapp complained: 'The giant bull is awesome. The giant, weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct … that is my issue.' 

Ward acknowledged Saturday that he did feel like something was a bit off after he installed the bull.

'It didn't even look (right), it was in the shape of a cone — but I don't know what a weenie on a bull is supposed to look like,' Ward said.

He said he didn't put it up to make anyone angry on purpose, but the conflict hasn't hurt his business.

'I put it up because it's an amazing piece, and I bought it as-is,' he said, 'but I am having fun with all the attention and it's brought in more customers.'
