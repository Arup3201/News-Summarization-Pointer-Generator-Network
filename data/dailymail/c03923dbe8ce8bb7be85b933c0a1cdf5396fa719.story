'Each day 
Ron sends me several videos, with some notes. I then take those videos, 
upload them, and publish them across the networks. The content is 
generally from the perspective of the dogs, or what the dogs might be 
thinking in their head,' Davis told BetaBeat.

The lucky dogs may soon get even more media exposure.

A show called Goin’ to the Dogs about Sturgeon, his wacky family and, of course his dogs, is currently being pitched to various TV networks.

It's one part reality show and one part competition series as Sturgeon's wife, adopted sons and canine heirs duke it out over the $75 million.

'There's talk in this family that he's going to leave it all to the g**d*** dogs,' said one son in a publicity short for the proposed series.

For his part, Sturgeon stays mum on who will benefit from his years of sharp business dealings.

'Nobody really knows what I'm gonna do with the money,' he said in a monologue tailor made for reality programming. 'They just need to keep sucking up.'

Sturgeon loves his dogs and rumor has it he will one day leave his $75 million dollar estate to the pooches

Ron Sturgeon is a self-made millionaire who began his career by opening an auto salvage business when he was fresh out of high school in 1978.

The business, which he started when when his dad died and left him homeless and along, eventually grew into the largest of its kind in the United States.

He sold his chain of auto salvage yards to Ford in 1999 for upwards of $20 million before buying it back from the car company for a profit years later.

Sturgeon soon sold the business that made him a millioanire once again, this time for $23.5 million.

In between these deals, he worked for Ford and started a successful auto auction for insurers, which won him even more millions.

Now in his 60s, Sturgeon collects toy and adult-sized cars. He displays many of his 3,000 toys at one of his Texas offices.

As of 2010, he owned 14 cars that included Bentleys and Ferreris, according to Dallas News.

In 2013, Sturgeon published a sex and relationship advice book called Men are Pigs: And that's a good thing in which he describes how he applies his keen business sense to women in order to become a 'sex whisperer.'
