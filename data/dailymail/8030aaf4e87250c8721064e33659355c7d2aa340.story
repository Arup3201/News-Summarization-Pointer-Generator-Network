A two-year freeze on energy bills would save the taxpayer at least £100million, government figures reveal.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said schools, hospitals and Whitehall departments would benefit now if the coalition imposed his plan to block gas and electricity rises.

But he accused David Cameron of siding with the Big Six energy firms who will impose crippling price hikes of up to 10 per cent this winter.

Savings: Labour leader Ed Miliband' plan to freeze energy prices would save 
the taxpayer £100million over two years by helping schools, hospitals 
and government departments, government figures have revealed

Mr Miliband unveiled his 1970s-style plan for the state to intervene in the energy market at the Labour conference in Brighton.

He promised to freeze energy bills for 20months if Labour wins the election in May 2015, using the time to break up the market and abolish regulator Ofgem.

He said the plan would save the average family £120.

But new figures released by ministers also show the potential savings on heating and lighting government buildings.

The NHS alone could save more than £40million, which would pay for 1,300 nurses. Schools could save £28million, equivalent to the salaries of more 700 teachers.

Mr Miliband told MailOnline: 
’Labour’s price freeze will save families an average £120 and an average
small business user would benefit by over £5,000.

’But
it’s not just Britain’s families and businesses that would benefit from
this price freeze, it’s our vital public services too.

’New figures today show that if David Cameron put in place our freeze today, public services would save £100m.

’And that matters more than ever in an era when there’s less money around.’

Recently announced price hikes will hit the public sector as well as hard-pushed families

Mr Cameron has repeatedly dismissed Labour’s plan for a freeze as a ’con’ which cannot be delivered.

And it is predicted that energy firms will dramatically hike prices just before the general election.Npower chief executive Paul Massara warned Britain could be hit by power cuts if Labour moves to freeze bills.

He claimed the industry needed a ‘stable environment’ to commit to investment in the energy network.

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises for this winter.

ScottishPower
bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent 
price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern 
Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

Mr Miliband, who is due to give a speech on living costs in Hornsey and Wood Green today, added: ’This freeze will happen under the next Labour Government and while prices are frozen we will reset the broken energy market.

’Across Britain families are struggling from the cost of living crisis and the Conservative Party just doesn’t have an answer.

’This shows how out of touch the Tories have become - they are on the side of energy companies not of families struggling with the cost of living crisis and relying on public services that are under huge financial pressure.

’David Cameron has been recruited by the Big 6. He is now part of the Big 7.’

Figures released in Parliament show how bills for Whitehall departments have soared. In 2012-13 alone the NHS spent £634million on energy costs, up 15 per cent since the election.

The Department for Energy and Climate Change, in charge of keeping the lights on, spent £203,137 on electricity and £22,654 on gas in 2912-13, up from £165,782 and £16,700 respectively on a year earlier - a 22 per cent increase.

Last year the Home Office spent £5.7million on electricity and £1.1million on gas, up from £5.1million and £640,000 in 2011-12, a rise of 18 per cent rise.

The Ministry of Defence spent £122million on gas and £209million on electricity across the defence estate.

Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said: 'These figures show that it’s not only households and businesses that are paying the price for a broken energy market, it’s the taxpayer too.

'We need Labour's price freeze and reforms to the energy market - not only to help hard-pressed families, but to spare the taxpayer these higher costs too.'

Ministers insist efforts have already been made to reduce  costs, including energy saving measures and buying gas and electricity through a centralised Government Procurement Service (GPS) system.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said this week: ’Labour’s price freeze is a con. It damages competition and it damages investment.

’That contrasts with what the Government are offering, which is direct help to the poorest in society, radical energy efficiency programmes, and a focus on competition that the Labour party never had.’
