Derby's new signing George Thorne is out for nine months after injuring the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.

Thorne, 21, joined Derby from West Brom last weekend before sustaining the injury during a pre-season friendly defeat against Zenit St Petersburg on Tuesday.

He left Derby's camp in Austria on Wednesday and had surgery on Thursday.

Meteoric rise: Thorne was part of the Derby side that lost the play-off final against QPR last season

Bad timing: Thorne completed a permanent move to Derby only days before injuring his knee ligaments

Thorne tweeted: 'Obviously gutted doesn't really cut it, but I know how to handle it. Appreciate all the messages guys'.

He added: 'Dont forget what the team achieved last year. Exciting season ahead & I'll join them for the run in. Look forward to seeing the iPro rocking'.

Derby manager Steve McClaren told the club's official website: 'At the time it looked to be innocuous as there was no-one near George and we thought he had just jarred his knee.

'Scans have revealed that he has ruptured his cruciate ligament and he will be operated on today (Thursday).

'It is a huge disappointment for George personally and we wish him a speedy recovery.

'We were patient in our quest to sign him this summer, as he was too, and this news demonstrates the pitfalls of football in general.

'Everyoneâ€™s thoughts are with George and there is no doubt he will come back from this.'

Faith: Derby manager Steve McClaren is confident Thorne will bounce back from this blow
