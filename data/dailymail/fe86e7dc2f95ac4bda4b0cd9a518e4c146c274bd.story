Cardiff Blues have announced the signing of Samoa international centre Rey Lee-Lo from Super Rugby side the Hurricanes.

The Blues confirmed that the 28-year-old has agreed a long-term deal.

His move to Wales, which will take effect after this year's Super Rugby season, will see him reunited with current Blues rugby director and former Hurricanes boss Mark Hammett.

Lee-Lo, who made his Samoa debut last year, was in the starting line-up against England at Twickenham just under two months ago.

'Rey is a player I know really well from our time together at the Hurricanes and I'm sure he will be a big asset to Cardiff Blues,' Hammett said.

'One of his big strengths is that he's a powerful man while also being extremely agile and playing with real speed to his game.

'Rey has improved every season and he will be determined to take this opportunity at Blues and be a big success in Wales.'
