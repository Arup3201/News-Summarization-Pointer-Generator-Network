Mark Hughes accused referee Michael Oliver of denying Stoke ‘two clear-cut penalties’ as they drew with Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium.

Hughes was furious that Oliver did not penalise Chris Smalling for handling Peter Crouch’s header in the second-half, and also claimed that Geoff Cameron was fouled as he attempted to score from close-range when another Crouch effort hit the post.

‘We had two clear penalty claims that should have been given, certainly the first one,’ said the Stoke manager.

Stoke manager Mark Hughes was furious his side were not awarded at least one penalty at the Britannia

‘Chris Smalling has lost Peter Crouch on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. It’s a goalbound header and he’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down.

‘The referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know.

‘It’s a waste of time (speaking to Oliver about it). I’m sure he will say something like the lad couldn’t get out of the way because he was so close but I don’t think that’s the case.

‘Then we hit the post from Peter’s header and it’s come back out and Geoff Cameron has been taken out. He was just waiting to put the ball over the line. From our point of view it’s two clear-cut penalties.

‘If you look at those two situations and then the opportunities in the first half, overall I think we were the better team.

‘Mame Diouf goes through and should have done better. It’s disappointing because at 2-0 we would been in a situation where I don’t think United would have been able to come back given the way they performed.’

Crouch backed his manager’s point of view, saying: ‘I thought it was a definite penalty. It was a yard away from me and I knew I won the header cleanly. I think Smalling had his hands up.’

United manager Louis van Gaal claimed that he did not see the incident but questioned whether Smalling’s actions were deliberate.

‘Why did he raise his hand?’ said Van Gaal. ‘I don’t think that it’s always a penalty when the ball is hitting the hand or the arm or something like that. I have to see it, and I haven’t seen I yet.’
