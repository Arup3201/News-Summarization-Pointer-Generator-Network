Karim Benzema snubbed a move to Manchester United in 2009, according to Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas.

The France striker left his boyhood club for Real Madrid that summer, but Aulas claims an offer to move to Old Trafford was also on the table.

United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid the same summer, with Benzema now linking up with the Portugal superstar and Gareth Bale to forge the Spanish giants' 'BBC' attack.

Clubs:

Real Madrid (2009 -) 165 games, 75 goals

Now Aulas has revealed that Benzema spurned United's advances to fulfill a long-term dream of playing at the Bernabeu.

'For a long time he wanted to play one day at Real Madrid and when operations began to fall into place, we did not object,' Aulas told Canal+.

'The proposal was superior to Manchester United's but he was given the opportunity to go where he wanted.

Manchester United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m and signed: 

Antonio Valencia (Wigan) - £16m

Michael Owen - free transfer

Gabrial Obertan (Bordeaux) - £3m

Mame Biram Diouf (Molde) - undisclosed

Chris Smalling (Fulham) - £10m 

'I am very happy for him. This is the best striker in La Liga and one of the best in the world.

'The criticism he has received are part of the life of a professional football player, but we had to be above it all.'

United ended up signing Michael Owen on a free transfer that season and Mame Biram Diouf from Molde. 

Sir Alex Ferguson's side finished second in the Premier League behind Chelsea, who went on to also win the FA Cup.
