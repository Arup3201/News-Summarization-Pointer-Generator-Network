Mark Cavendish joined over 1,000 keen cyclists on the streets of London on Sunday as this year's Help for Heroes Hero Ride came to an end in the capital.

The British cycling star jumped on his own bike to help start the final leg of the mammoth fundraising challenge, which supports wounded, injured and sick service personnel.

Organisers hope to raise at least £1million through the event, which has seen cyclists throughout the UK complete journeys of more than 160,000 miles.

And they're off! Over 1,000 cyclists rode the final 10 miles from Blackheath Common to Horse Guards Parade on Sunday

Cavendish, whose wife Peta introduced him to the charity, arrived at Blackheath Common in south London to sound the horn as people from as far away as Brussels arrived to cycle the final 10 miles of this year's ride.

Cyclists stopped off at The Cenotaph on Whitehall to lay wreaths and pay their respects to those who have died or been injured in combat, before continuing to the finish line at Horse Guards Parade.

The riders, who were accompanied by Cavendish and his wife for the last leg, even paused to form a giant version of the Help for Heroes logo.

'I know about how much training and dedication has to go in to a cycling
 event like Hero Ride – you have to be so disciplined and all of the 
cyclists taking part on Sunday have a great cause in Help for Heroes 
that they’re fighting for,' said Cavendish, who is a patron for the charity.

'I am delighted to have started the 
riders and joined them on their final 10 miles into central London.

'I 
hope as many people as possible support the challenge, donate to Help 
for Heroes and celebrate each rider completing their own personal 
challenge.'

Moment of reflection: Organisers hope that this year's ride will raise £1million for injured service personnel

Hundreds of rides have contributed to the this year's 160,000 mile total, including routes from Belgium, Edinburgh, Manchester, Cardiff and the Help for Heroes Recovery Centre at Tedworth House in Tidworth.

Peta Cavendish, who completed the 335 miles-Big 
Battlefield Bike Ride from Brussels to Paris, added: 'I have supported 
Help for Heroes since the charity was founded and took part in their 
first ever cycle ride back in 2008 so it’s great to have done the Big 
Battlefield Bike Ride again.

'Hero Ride is a true show of 
support, the biggest cycling fundraiser that has been done to date and I
 really hope the public get behind us and donate.

Special effort: Hundreds of rides have taken place and around 160,000 miles have been covered in this year's Hero Ride

'Everyone 
taking part in Hero Ride has taken on their own personal challenge, they
 have been training hard for this event in support of our wounded and it
 means so much to see people on the streets supporting us as well.

'I 
have witnessed the great work that Help for Heroes do to support those 
who have suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses and I want to do 
all I can to help raise as much as possible.'
