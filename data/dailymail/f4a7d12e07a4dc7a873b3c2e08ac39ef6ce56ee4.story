Officials at some Denver homeless
 shelters say the legalization of marijuana has contributed to an 
increase in the number of younger people living on the city's streets.

One 
organization dealing with the increase is Urban Peak, which provides 
food, shelter and other services to homeless people aged 15 to 24 in 
Denver and Colorado Springs.

'Of
 the new kids we're seeing, the majority are saying they're here because
 of the weed,' deputy director Kendall Rames told The Denver Post. 'They're traveling through. It is very 
unfortunate.'

The Salvation 
Army's single men's shelter in Denver has been serving more homeless 
this summer, and officials have noted an increase in the number of 18- 
to 25-year-olds there.

The 
shelter housed an average of 225 each night last summer, but this summer
 it's averaging 300 people per night.

No breakdown was available by age,
 but an informal survey found that about a quarter of the increase was 
related to marijuana, including people who moved hoping to find work in 
the marijuana industry, said Murray Flagg, divisional social services 
secretary for the Salvation Army's Intermountain Division.

Some
 of the homeless have felony backgrounds that prevent them from working 
in pot shops and grow houses, which are regulated by the state, Flagg 
said.

He also thinks others may find work but don't earn enough to pay 
rent in Denver's expensive housing market.

At
 the St. Francis Center, a daytime homeless shelter, pot is the second 
most frequently volunteered reason for being in Colorado, after looking 
for work.

St. Francis 
executive director Tom Leuhrs also sees an economic reason for the 
increase of the number of homeless young people. They're having 
difficulty moving from high school and college to the workforce, Leuhrs 
said.

'The economy is not supporting them. There are not enough jobs,' he said.

Edward
 Madewell said he was on his way back home to Missouri when he decided 
to head to Colorado so he could keep smoking the marijuana he uses to 
control seizures.

'I'm not going to stop using something organic. I 
don't like the pills,' he said.

Dusty
 Taylor, 20, said he moved back to Colorado, where he grew up, to avoid 
legal problems.

'I don't want to catch a felony for smoking,' he said.
