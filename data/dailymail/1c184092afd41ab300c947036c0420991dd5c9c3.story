A Connecticut home built like a castle, and with all the fixings, has just gone on the market for $45 million.

Eccentric millionaire Christopher Mark is unloading his property, which he began building in 2001, and was only completed in 2008, just three years after he made headlines for reportedly kicking out girlfriend Marina Isakova and the couple's child from the lush digs.

The 35,000 square feet home, in Woodstock, Connecticut, is located on 75 acres of land, and comes with a turret and a moat around a 30-acre lake.

'It looks like a real castle from medieval times, like something you’d see at Walt Disney World or in Ireland,'  listing broker John Pizzi of Randall Realtors told the New York Post.

Swank digs: Construction on the castle got underway in 2001, and wasn't completed until 2008

Lots of space: The castle has 8 bedroom, 8.5 baths, massage rooms, and a shower that fits multiple people

Happy memories: Isakova's daughter Polina and Mark's two daughters in front of the castle

Back in February of 2011, Miss Isakova said she was living in the castle with her 9-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Polina, and her newborn baby, Maria, when Mark 'told his workers to throw me on the street with my babies.'

She then alleged that her ex was only paying the minimum in child support, $1,000 a month, and she was being forced to live on food stamps. 

This after having to move from the palatial residence to a walk-up in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York. 

Mark is the great-grandson of a Chicago steel tycoon.

The couple had begun dating in 2009 after Mark asked Miss Isakova to leave her husband and move in with him and his two daughters.

Mark is now remarried.

According to Estately, the castle boasts 8 bedrooms, 8.5 bathrooms, massage rooms, a shower for multiple people and, at one time, there was even a petting zoo on the property. 

Not included however is staff, with the property requiring about 10 people to be run properly.
