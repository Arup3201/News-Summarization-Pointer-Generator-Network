A heartless woman vandalized a 9/11 memorial dedicated to police officers who saved countless lives on September 11, 2001 - by smearing it with white paint.

The vandal, thought to be a white woman in her late 40's to 50's, struck at the memorial in Brooklyn, New York between 2.38am and 2.55am on Friday morning when she knew no one would be around.

She walked up to MCU Park’s Brooklyn Wall of Remembrance and used her paint-covered hands to smudge the name of hero Officer Moira Smith, according to police.

Officers discovered the damage around 4:30 p.m., on the wall covered in images of all first responders' killed on September 11, 2001.

Eyewitnesses said a picture of Detective Joseph Vigiano had also been defaced.

However, the vandal left the most damage at the part of the wall dedicated to Smith, a 38-year-old officer, who was praised for her courage on the day that terrorists struck at the heart of America.

She was immortalized by an image showing her helping  Edward Nicholls, a bleeding broker, from the South Tower of the World Trade Center on the day of the terror attacks.
