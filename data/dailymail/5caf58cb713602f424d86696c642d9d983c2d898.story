 

Police have released grainy CCTV footage of a man they believe could be linked to 45 burglaries in the past five months.

Officers in Sussex fear a gang is targeting elderly, vulnerable residents by 'cold-calling', then returning when they have left the house - in some cases after they were taken to care homes.

Some of the victims were unable to remember what was stolen, while others lost sentimental items including several wedding rings, bracelets, brooches and pendants.

Suspect: This man could be linked to as many as 45 burglaries in Sussex over the past five months

Grainy: The footage shows the man forcing open the back doors of one of the victims' homes in August

The newly-released CCTV footage shows a man sneaking into the back garden of a house in Steyning, West Sussex.

He peers through the glass back doors before pulling them open forcefully and charging into the house.

The burglary, which took place in August and was one of the first allegedly orchestrated by the gang, set a similar model for more than 40 others, police said.

In each of the 45 burglaries, thieves entered houses through a back door or window then escaped with jewellery or antique items with a total value of tens of thousands of pounds.

Possessions stolen included a platinum wedding ring, a Russian wedding ring with three bands of different golds and several other wedding rings.

Haul: Taken in the raids were a gold watch, several wedding rings, candlesticks and Royal Doulton figurines

Also taken in the raids were Royal Doulton figurines, a gold watch, silver drink trays, an emerald pendant, a silver brooch, two Art Nouveau solid silver candlesticks and various chains, bracelets and necklaces. 

Victims include homeowners who have gone on holiday and elderly residents whose homes have been targeted within days of them moving into care homes.

Officers are investigating whether the offenders are cold-calling homes first to work out who is in and whether they have valuables inside.

Police now want to identify a man they believe is a suspect seen in the CCTV.

The burglaries have mainly focused on the Horsham, Wealden and Lewes districts.

Prize: One of the items taken was this ornamental plate. Some victims could not remember what was stolen

Towns and villages  struck include Coolham, Henfield, Steyning, Horsham, Pulborough, Bramber, Billingshurst, Kirdford, West Chiltington, Ashurst and Petworth.

Katy Wood, from Sussex's Police's Operation Magpie team leading the investigation, said: 'We urgently need the public’s help to identify who is responsible.

'Don’t let cold callers into your home and please report anyone acting suspiciously in your home or nearby to us immediately.

'Please consider fitting an alarm if you don’t have one, fit timers to your lights so they do on when you are not there and make sure you leave your home secure.'
