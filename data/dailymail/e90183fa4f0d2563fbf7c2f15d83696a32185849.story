A political reporter for the New York Times has been inundated with abuse after Twitter users mistook him for Miami Dolphins lineman Jonathan Martin.

Despite having a profile clearly stating his role as a journalist, Mr Martin received a barrage of tweets after his professional footballer namesake quit his team over claims that he had been bullied.

Instead of redirecting the misguided sports followers, the political writer retweeted the more family friendly messages but his amusement at their content was soon replaced with sympathy for the intended target of the tweets.

Mr Martin, who has 67,000 followers on Twitter, revealed details of the mix up and his response to it, in an article for the New York Times.

'As the story has intensified and 
misplaced 140-character assaults have piled up, though, the 
misunderstanding has lost some of its charm. I feel bad for my fellow 
Jonathan Martin,' he wrote.

'The 
whole affair has also been a reminder about how ugly discourse can be on
the internet.'

The abusive tweets included rants from fans who blamed footballer Martin for ruining the team's chances.

The 24-year-old has said that he wants to continue playing in the NFL but said the past season and a half with the Dolphins had been unbearable for him, a source told ESPN.

Misdirected: Despite a Twitter profile stating he is a political correspondent for the New York Times, Martin still received messages meant for the footballer

His attorney alleged that Martin was harassed daily, and teammate Richie Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother.

Some messages of support were included in the barrage of tweets sent to the New York Times reporter, but he admitted most were further attacks on the footballer.

" 'U got a beagle dog as ur profile pic n 
ur in the nfl," wrote @calli_631, who also used a word a vulgarity to 
accuse me of ruining the Dolphins’ season,' Mr Martin wrote.

'Somebody named RunRickyRun 
(handle: @LordGexs) was a bit more delicate about my namesake’s absence 
from Miami’s offensive line. "The Dolphins need ya back ASAP!!!!!",' he added.

Abuse: Reporter Martin was at the receiving end of rants from angry sports fans

Support: Some of the tweets sent to the journalist were more supportive of the footballer

But as more abusive tweets started coming in, the reporter began to feel increased sympathy for the intended target.

His experiences at the receiving end of misguided abuse was shared by Gerry Sandusky, a sportscaster mistaken for former Penn State assistant Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of child abuse.

'I have walked where fate has now taken you,'  Gerry Sandusky wrote to Mr Martin, in empathy at the reporter's current problems.
