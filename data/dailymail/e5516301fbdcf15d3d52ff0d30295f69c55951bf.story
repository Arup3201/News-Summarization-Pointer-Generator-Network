A 
used-car salesman has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife,
their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family 
home after his marriage collapsed.

Danai
Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he 
killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching 
the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent.

Mrs
Crook’s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe 
burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 
last year and he died six days later.

Muhammadi
and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the 
letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out 
at the base of the stairs. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts 
of murder.

The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold.

As
smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Mrs Crook 
collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters 
lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt.

Amid
the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, 
causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back 
inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape.

Her
husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following
his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But 
26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew 
the windows out.

He 
suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in 
East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in 
the intensive care unit. He died six days later.

Muhammadi’s
new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of 
murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts 
of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court.

Muhammadi and Mahmud were also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder.

Muhammadi and Mahmud showed no emotion as they learned of the verdicts flanked by security guards and interpreters.

In
the public gallery, survivors Amanda and Bohdan Crook shook visibly and
hugged each other as the jury foreman read out the verdicts in front of
a packed courtroom.

As Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said that Muhammadi and Mahmud faced life behind bars, a family member shouted 'good'.

The judge told the jury: 'There can be very few criminal cases which are as taxing for a jury than this one must have been.

'I don’t suppose any of us are going to forget some aspects of the evidence we have heard about the fire.'

In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated.

Smith
had started a relationship with Mrs Crook’s estranged husband, Danai 
Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted her 
about their “great life together”.Smith also mocked Mrs Crook 
about her size, for being “boring” in the bedroom and added: “Enjoy your
life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.”

Muhammadi
told the court he had a good relationship with his estranged wife, but 
it became clear in the trial that he had thoughts of extreme violence.

Up
to three months before the fire, he told one workmate he wanted to harm
his estranged wife, telling them he was going to throw acid in her face
to “f*** up her life”.

Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt
“sick” when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the 
fire that killed three generations of her family.

Mrs
Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her 
22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa’s brother - but both said the end of 
the court case would not bring them closure.She said: 'We weren’t 
just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his 
wife and his own child and his father-in-law.

'He’s taken away our whole lives, just because of his greed, and that’s all it was.'It was greed. There was no reason to do what he did.'

Speakign
after the guilty verdict, she added: 'The verdict today is not a cause 
for celebration for us, the family, but we are relieved that we have at 
least received justice.

'The evil people convicted today are now deprived of their liberty, and justly so.

'However, no sentence they received could bring back the loved ones they took from us.'

Police
initially had no reason to suspect Muhammadi until they visited him at 
his new home in Coventry and discovered, through automatic number plate 
recognition technology, that he had driven to Kent and back around the 
time of the fire.

Mobile phone records later revealed that, in an effort to eliminate himself 
from suspicion, Muhammadi texted Mrs Crook at around 11am that morning.

He wrote: 'Hi mel, hope you both well. Can I book the hotel for 22 
September. Let me know please. Love you, mate. Give Noah (a) hug and 
kiss from me. X.'

Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC described 
it as a 'cynical and breathtaking attempt' to protect himself from 
suspicion of the arson attack he committed just hours earlier.

After police discovered he had travelled to Kent,
Muhammadi, who was raised in Iran, was arrested and during a search of 
his home, a post-code for a property in Maidstone was found on a scrap 
of paper.

This led officers to Mahmud - and in the bath of his flat officers found the plant sprayer used to start the fire.

Mobile
phone records then proved Smith was in Kent at the fire and had made a 
999 call - between calls to Mahmud and Muhammadi - claiming she had 
driven past a burning house.

A date for sentencing was provisionally set for the first week in July.
