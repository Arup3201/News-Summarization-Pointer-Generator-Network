No longer the circus clowns, Chelsea returned to Anfield as the ringmaster running the show.

Jose Mourinho famously refused to accept the bit-part role here back in April, when Chelsea’s 2-0 win at Anfield derailed Liverpool’s title ambitions.

Then, the Chelsea manager said he had the suspicion his team were being disregarded as something akin to a peripheral comic turn in Liverpool’s prospective title celebration. He duly sent out an under-strength side to defend assiduously, won the game and hauled down Anfield’s Big Top.

Ratings by DOMINIC KING at Anfield 

But seven months on Chelsea are a different proposition. They are now the Premier League’s dominant force - 15 points clear of Liverpool now - while it is Brendan Rodgers who suddenly appears a little exposed.

When last week he gambled by leaving seven players out at the Bernabeu – all seven returned  – he appeared to have escaped ignominy with an honourable 1-0 defeat. But on Saturday, when he removed Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can on 70 minutes, boos resounded around Anfield. 

Rodgers has built up enough goodwill here to survive a brief outburst of frustration but perhaps a slither of belief has been eroded.

But Mourinho was able to assume the role to which he is suited: that of dominant alpha male. ‘It was fantastic performance and an expression of ambition,’ he said. ‘In the second half, against Liverpool, at Anfield, every team accepts a point as a good result. 

'My team didn’t accept that, so the way they performed in the second half was an expression of that ambition and self-belief they have at the moment. Sometimes you get points and you don’t deserve but this is the case where the best team won.’

Gary Cahill did almost threw away their good work, leaning into a Steven Gerrard shot on 87 minutes with his arm when, when, for the second time in the afternoon, he somehow managed to avoid conceding a penalty. 

Referee Anthony Taylor did not have one of his finest afternoons. In reality though, by that stage it was rare moment of un-ease for Chelsea even if it understandably irked Rodgers.

‘It’s bitterly disappointing for us,’ he said. ‘It’s a big decision in a big game which we didn’t get and it wasn’t even in doubt, it was a clear, clear handball and the referee had a clear look. My players gave everything today and if they weren’t going to get it from open play they certainly deserved it from the penalty spot. It is a difficult moment for us as we’re not getting the results and it’s been a tough week.’

Yet even when Chelsea fell behind here - and how Anfield roared when they did, hoping that the spirit of 2013-14 could be revived - you never felt that they had lost control of this game. Liverpool were a side seemingly always on the verge of a defensive breakdown, while their visitors appeared to be simply to biding their time to seize victory.

That said, it took time to achieve and that is to Liverpool’s credit. They were better than they have been, especially in those opening exchanges, when they energy of their game did hark back to last season and temporarily disrupted Chelsea’s progress.

They started in a frenzy. Emre Can’s first-minute shot was deflected wide by John Terry but when he tried again on nine minutes, Gary Cahill got in the way and diverted it past his keeper and Anfield once again roared with kind of belief that so energised the team last season.

This being Chelsea though, they were not swept away by the whirlwind. Cesc Fabregas, who like Ramires was playing with an injury which Mourinho said may cost them games later in the month, took the corner on 14 minutes which was met by Diego Costa who flicked on for John Terry to head from close range.

Simon Mignolet produced a superb reaction save and seemed to have done the same from Cahill’s scuffed shot from the rebound. But the goal-line technology showed the ball over the line. Of course, it all occurred in front of the Kop, scene of Luis Garcia’s ghost goal of folklore. This time, however, there was no debate. ‘Everyone knows this is truth and that is fantastic for us as professional and for the crowd, as they know it’s true, and for the referees,’ said Mourinho.

The same could not be said for the contentious decisions that followed. Raheem Sterling's mis-hit was stopped by the arm of a diving Cahill on 26 minutes but referee Taylor missed that and Alberto Moreno’s block with his arm on 36 minutes, another clear penalty of the three he should have awarded in the game.

Moreno’s misdemeanour came within an extraordinary spell of Chelsea pressure in which Liverpool simply could not get out of their half. Frustration reached a climax when Gerrard attempted to clear only to collide with Jordan Henderson and Anfield howled with indignation for, at the moment, it felt respite would never come.

Blocks from Glen Johnson- at least three – and Dejan Lovren were responsible for holding Chelsea at bay. All the while, Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel were conducting a battle that appeared to be a cross between heavyweight boxing and hand-to-hand wrestling.

If ever a team needed half time, it was Liverpool. But they did emerge for the second half somewhat calmer. True they needed a Lovren header to prevent Eden Hazard’s lovely chipped pass reaching Costa. But equally, when Sterling cut inside Ivanovic on 54 minutes, he forced a sharp save from Courtois.

The breakthrough came on 66 minutes when Cesar Azpilicueta admirably refused to give up on a lost cause and – just – kept the ball in when chasing down the left wing. He then brushed Philippe Coutinho aside on his way to goal. Mignolet deflected his cross but only into the path of Costa who, inside the penalty area, finished as expected.
