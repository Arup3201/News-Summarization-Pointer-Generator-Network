As a teenager, Liberty Caton despised the reflection staring back at her in the mirror.

She refused to pose for photographs, covering her boyish frame in baggy t-shirts and shunning the pretty dresses and strappy tops her friends wore.

Her confidence was shattered when doctors revealed her twisted spine was the result of the medical condition scoliosis.

But now 23, Miss Caton has transformed her image, after years of being forced to wait for the life-changing surgery she could only have once fully grown.

Liberty Caton suffered scoliosis, a severe curvature of the spine, as a teenager, leaving her body twisted and one leg considerably longer than the other (left). Today the 23-year-old finally feels comfortable posing for photos after surgery to transform her body (right)

And to top her new look off, the customer services agent, had a boob job to boost her chest from a 30B to a 30FF, giving her the feminine curves she has always dreamed of.

Miss Caton's scoliosis was so severe that one leg grew shorter than the other and her shoulders and ribs protruded at different angles.

She said: ’Once I hated my body so much I couldn’t bare to look in the mirror. Now I love it and I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve been through to be able to say that.

'It's been rebuilt and I'm delighted with the results.

'My condition stopped me feeling attractive for many years. But now after the operations I could not be happier.

'My friends and family call me Iron Woman but it was the implants that really gave me the figure I craved.'

Miss Caton, from Slough, Berkshire, was in her teens when she first began to notice her shape was at odds with her peers.

She said: ‘My back was stooped and then I noticed my rib cage seemed twisted.’

Over time, her condition got worse and she noticed one leg was longer than the other.

Doctors told Miss Caton she would have to wait for corrective surgery until she had fully grown. In July 2009 surgeons inserted iron rods into her spine (right) to straighten her spine, (left before surgery)

She said: ‘Like most self conscious 
teenagers I kept myself covered up all the time to try and hide the 
irregularities in my shape.'

Finally she confided in her parents who made an appointment with their GP.

Miss Caton was examined and referred to a specialist who confirmed she was suffering with scoliosis, an abnormal and severe curvature of the spine.

It was so extreme that one leg had grown longer than the other to compensate for the twist in her frame.

'My back was stooped and then I noticed my rib cage seemed twisted... I felt very unattractive and couldn't wait to have surgery'

But consultants at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford were hopeful that Miss Caton would benefit from surgery.

The solution was an operation to insert iron rods into her back to straighten it.

But doctors revealed, much to Miss Caton's despair, that the operation could only be performed once she had stopped growing.

She said: ‘I understood why, but it was awful being told that basically I would have to spend the remainder of my teenage years feeling unhappy and unattractive.

'While my friends wore pretty dresses and strappy tops I kept covered up in baggy clothes. I felt very unfeminine and unattractive and couldn't wait to have surgery.'

Finally in July 2009 she underwent the nine-hour operation and, after a week in hospital, spent three months at home recovering. 

To complete her transformation Miss Caton went under the knife once more, for a boob job to boost her chest from a 30B to 30FF. She said: 'I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance'

She was astonished to learn she had grown three inches as a result of the successful operation, going from 5ft 6ins to 5ft 9ins.

Miss Caton said: ‘It was fantastic but I knew straight away I wasn’t finished. After waiting so long I was determined to look more curvy and feminine.’  

So she decided to complete her transformation with a boob job to boost her from a 30B to a 30FF.

She had a consultation with a surgeon from Transform Medical Group who agreed to operate and she took out a loan to cover the £3,500 cost.

'I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance now. I spent my teenage years hidden away so I'm making up for lost time'

Miss Caton said: ‘The staff at Transform were extremely sympathetic with regards to my medical history and I felt the surgeon really understood why it was so important to me to have the operation after what I had been through.’

Following the operation last March she says her confidence has finally blossomed and she can at last enjoy being photographed.

She said: ‘I built this body for me, nobody else so I don’t care what anyone thinks. I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance now.

‘I can walk into a shop and pick up anything I like knowing it will fit and look nice. I threw out all my baggy clothes and now I love tight stuff and bikinis.

‘I spent my teenage years hidden away so I’m making up for lost time.’
