The stakes have been raised in the bidding war for New York's most iconic building after an anonymous Middle Eastern buyer offered $2.1 billion for the Empire State Building.

The offer comes a week after real estate investor Rubin Schron made a $2 million cash offer for the building.

The Malkin family who bought the building in 2002 want to turn a New York property portfolio, including the Empire State Building and 18 other buildings, into a publicly traded company.

Joe Tabak, of 
Princeton Holdings, and Philip Pilevsky, of Philips International, are said to be working with the Middle 
Eastern bidder, according to the New York Post.

'To this guy, it’s like buying a 
painting,' a source said about the unnamed bidder, who is not believed to be an Arab.

'It will be very hard 
to stop them. They will keep ratcheting up [the offer] until they get 
it.'

The 102-storey building was valued at $2.3 billion in a filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. However, the city valued the Empire State Building, which is only 88 percent-occupied, at $775,009,000.

Despite tax exemptions for energy 
efficiency plans in the building, it still has to pay about $31 million a
 year in property taxes.

The building has 2.7 million square feet of commercial space, but its real financial draw is the money made from its observation decks on the 86th and 102nd floors.

Opened with the push of a button from Washington DC in 1931, President Herbert Hoover ushered in another league for office buildings which would find its way through Hollywood pictures and endless skyline photographs as New York City's tallest building.Standing over a quarter of a mile in mid-town Manhattan, the Empire State Building pulls visitors 1,050 feet above the street to an observation deck on the 86th floor as well as one on their 102nd floor.In 1976 it had its 50 millionth visitor and in 1980 received its own zip code.Maintaining its original Art Deco interior though with expensive renovations, the building in 2007 was named 'America's Favorite Architecture' by the American Institute of Architects, 76 years after its opening. The final cost of the property and construction is estimated at $41 million after 410 days of construction and seven million hours of labor total.While the building offers 2.85 million square feet for rent, the possible move to go public would make it a real estate investment in its stock ownership.

The observation decks draw in about four
 million visitors a year, and made $60 million in profits in 2010, 
according to the New York Times.

The Malkin family bought the property in 2002 and, after much wrangling, gained total control of it in 2010.

A spokesman for the 
Malkin family said, 'We received last week two unsolicited bids to purchase 
the Empire State Building ,,, We are reviewing the offers and 
their terms.'

Mr Pilevsky said he was contacted by the Middle Eastern partners about making the cash bid.

'They view it as a last opportunity' to acquire the tower he told Bloomberg.

The Empire State Building held its 
own in the New York commercial real estate market -- even when Lehman's 
bankruptcy sent rents tumbling and tenants negotiated leaner terms -- 
helped by the expensive renovations to its Art Deco structure.

Two years ago, the building's owners 
embarked on a $500 million project to bring the skyscraper, completed in
 1931, to modern environmental standards.

In its filing earlier this year, the 
company said it currently plans to invest between $175 million and $215 
million of additional capital through the end of 2013, to continue to 
renovate and reposition its properties.

The first bidders for the building said their deal would allow investors to remain in the deal. 

Jason 
Meister, an investment broker representing Mr Schron, said: 'Our bid wasn’t out of left field as it is the most iconic 
building in the world.'

'It is important to consider that our
 offer is for all cash with a $50 million nonrefundable deposit and may 
very well exceed what the REIT stock ... ends up trading for.'
