At least 10 people were injured after an explosion ripped through the bus in which they were travelling through the heart of Tel Aviv today.

The bomb blast shattered windows on the bus which was driving along a street running close to Israel's defence headquarters.

Israel's ambulance service said three of the wounded were in a moderate-to-serious condition and there was reportedly a second device but that failed to detonate.

Police cleared the area shortly after the bomb went off and were carrying out investigations on the wreckage of the vehicle.

'A bomb exploded on a bus in central 
Tel Aviv. This was a terrorist attack. Most of the injured suffered only
mild injuries," said Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu.

In a message on Twitter, he said police were combing the area for the person who planted the device, apparently confirming reports that it was not a suicide attack.

Israeli media said a man had been arrested - the last terror attack in Tel Aviv was in 2006.

The bombing happened on the eighth day
of an Israeli offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip and 
threatened to complicate Egyptian-led efforts to secure a ceasefire.

Celebratory gunfire rang out in Gaza City when local radio stations reported news of the Tel Aviv explosion.

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri praised the bombing, but stopped short of claiming responsibility.

'Hamas blesses the attack in Tel Aviv and sees it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres...in Gaza,' he said.

'Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression,' Abu Zuhri said.

The last time Israel's commercial capital was hit by a serious bomb blast was in April 2006, when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 11 people at a sandwich stand near the city's old central bus station.
