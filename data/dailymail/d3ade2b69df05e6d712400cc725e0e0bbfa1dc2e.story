Police documents make new claims that the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman 'you're lucky I haven't thrown you off the balcony' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death.

The documents, filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Gable Tostee's bail application hearing on Monday, allege a recording on Mr Tostee's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died.

The document claims the recording started at around 1am, the Courier Mail reports.

Tostee, 28, has been charged with the murder of Ms Wright, 26, who suffered a fatal fall from the Surfers Paradise balcony in Queensland on August 8. 

Police say they decided to arrest Tostee on August 15 after finding the recordings.

The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13am.

A male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, according to the police document. Police claim a male accuses the woman of 'beating him up.'

The male voice is also reportedly heard saying, 'I will do what you want, I will be your sex slave.'

A struggle is heard, during which a male voice allegedly says: 'This is f***ing b***s***, you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn little psycho b****'

Emergency crews at the scene of Ms Wright's death at the foot of the highrise Avalon apartments in Surfer's Paradise in Queensland, where Tostee resided.

The woman is told to leave without taking any of her belongings.

The man is alleged to have said 'If you try and pull anything, I'll knock you out, I'll knock you the f*** out', the Courier Mail report adds.

Police documents claims that the female voice apologises and pleads, 'Just let me go home.'

Tostee's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives. The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15.

The man allegedly replies: 'I would, but you have been a bad girl.'

A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer.

Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building.

It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright's death.

Ms Wright was a 26-year-old, visiting Australia for a two week trip to attend the wedding of friends

Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge, after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright's death on August 8.

Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30am.

Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, before returning to Tostee's apartment.

Ms Wright lived in New Zealand's Lower Hutt region and was in Australia for a two-week holiday to attend a wedding. 

Tostee maintains his innocence and says he will fight the charge.
