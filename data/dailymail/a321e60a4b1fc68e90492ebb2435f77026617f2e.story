When he was found crammed into a chicken coup, his rescuers feared for the worst.

But three months after Budi the orangutan was taken to safety in Indonesia, the little ape has finally left intensive care - and is almost able to stand by himself.

His heartbreaking plight and subsequent recovery has earned him fans around the world.

And from being so ill that he cried in pain if he was touched, he is now beginning to take his first steps - albeit with some assistance.

Ordeal: These were the appalling conditions Budi was found in when International Animal Rescue was asked to help by his owner, who admitted he was ill 

First steps: With the aid of physiotherapy, Budi's twisted and weakened limbs have begun to return to normal and she has made her first steps with the help of charity workers

Eating too: Fed for ten months on condensed milk, the little orangutan had lost the muscle use of his jaws, but is now beginning to feed himself

In new video footage aired on The Doctors on CBS his amazing recovery is apparent.

With the help of vets and other volunteers with charity International Animal Rescue (IAR), Budi is seen beginning to walk, his species' distinctive long arms being the key to getting moving.

Alan Knight, the chief executive of IAR, said: 'It’s hard to believe this healthy young infant is the same poor creature we found lying on his back in a cage, completely unable to move or sit up. 

'When Budi was rescued he was so weak and fragile that we all feared he wouldn’t survive. But he has proved to be a real fighter and is now safely on the road to recovery. 

'He still has a long way to go but his pain has subsided, the swelling in his body and limbs has disappeared, he has a healthy appetite and is becoming more energetic and active by the day.'

Budi is just one of the many orangutans exposed to appalling conditions in Borneo, where their natural habitats are increasingly under threat.

Many are orphaned during logging operations and the orphans kept as pets, with the people supposed to be looking after them entirely unaware of their needs.

Open wide: Budi had been unable to even open and close his mouth but is now feeding well at the sanctuary in Borneo which has rescued him and which depends on donations to help him and other animals

In training: Eventually vets will be able to see if Budi can swing through the trees like his relatives in the wild 

Sleeping well: At first Budi would scream in pain if touched but is now settling into a more normal life 

In Budi's case he was given just condensed milk, which meant that when the charity was contacted by his owner, he did not know how to chew, and his limbs - thanks to his poor diet - were misshapen, weak and swollen.

His owner, who lives in Kubing, in the Ketapang area of Western Borneo, had admitted he was ill when she asked for help from the charity.

Since his rescue Budi has learned how to eat properly, as he has gained the muscle strength to open and close his mouth, and been given physiotherapy to overcome the problems in his legs and arms.

Although he is yet to return to the trees where his species should live, the charity is hopeful of more progress.

At just over a year, Budi is still a baby, and a normal orangutan will not climb trees unassisted until they are around two, when they move in the branches by holding hands with other orangutans. 

In the wild the apes will be weaned around the age of four, and a year later begin to spend time away from their mothers.

The typical orangutan lifespan in captivity or the wild is around 30 years, and 45 years is towards the top of expectations. 

The oldest recorded lifespan was Guas, who died aged 59 at the Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, in 1977, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Budi's recovery will take many years and it is still too early to tell if he will be able to survive in the wild, his rescuers say. 

The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild.

If Budi does not regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life.

It has already received tens of thousands of dollars in donations for Budi and other animals' plight, but says more are welcome. 

International Animal Rescue, the British charity based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world.

Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries.

Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild.

International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations.

It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect.
