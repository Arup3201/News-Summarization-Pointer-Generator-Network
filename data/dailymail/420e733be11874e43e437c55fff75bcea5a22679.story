A female reporter covering a murder trial was ordered out of court after turning up in gold sequinned 'disco pants'.

Laura McQuillan's ejection from Wellington High Court in New Zealand sparked an online debate over the rights and wrongs of wearing the trousers in court.

Some posters claimed telling her to leave court was sexist considering there is no formal dress code and jeans are allowed.

A registrar at Wellington High Court approached Miss McQuillan, 25, who works for NZ Newswire, while she was sitting in an area reserved for media and asked her to leave before the hearing broke for lunch.

Afterwards, Miss McQuillan, who describes herself on her Twitter page as 'Winner, Most Awesome Person of the Year, 25 years running', took to the site to defend the trousers, saying: 'I'm sitting under a table! No one even sees my legs!'

When quizzed as to whether they were actually pants, she said they were, 'just tight and stretchy and bedazzled'.

She added: 'I don't know why people are acting like they've never seen sequinned pants before.'

According to a FAQ section of the New Zealand's Ministry of Justice website, there is 'no strict dress code bur smart casual dress is preferred'.

The advice, provided for people doing jury service, adds: 'You will be sitting down for a long time, so wear clothes you feel comfortable in.'

Among people who backed the court ejection, Alex Masterley said on Kiwiblog: 'It's a murder trial in the High Court, not fashion week.

'A high standard of dress is expected - even from journos.'

Another person remarked: 'At the very least she should have been arrested for a crime against fashion.'

A poster using the name Longknives said: 'If the younger generation can't see whatâ€™s wrong with wearing disco pants to the High Court or a ski jacket to parliament then I honestly fear for this country and its future.'

However, Joel Rowan felt Miss McQuillan had been dealt a harsh hand.

'Well,
in my view there should be a (reasonably high) standard of dress 
required.

'But if a man is allowed in jeans, then she should be allowed 
in those.'

A person going under the name Viking2 said the decision was 'quite clearly sexist'.

They added: 'Surely
the test should be whether the young lady was competent at her job and 
exhibited proper, correct and polite behaviour towards others.'

New Zealand broadcaster Kerre Woodham also backed Miss McQuillan.

She said: 'I got kicked out of court and an official warning when I wore a white sundress and got caught in the rain.'
