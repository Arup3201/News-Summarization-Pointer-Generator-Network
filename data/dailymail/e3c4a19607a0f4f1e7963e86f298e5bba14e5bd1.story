A Florida father and his son are in intensive care after being attacked by a massive swarm of yellow jacket wasps.

David Alvarez, who is allergic to hornets, and his seven-year-old son Jordan were taking their dog for a stroll last Wednesday in a wooded area they frequented near where they live in Altamonte Springs, Florida, when one of them stepped on a nest, disturbing thousands of wasps.Â 

The subsequent attack left them both covered in marks and swollen, said Jennifer Jones, Mr Alvarez's wife. 'It's just horrible,' she said.

David Alvarez, his son Jordan and their dog were attacked by a swam of wasps last week in central Florida. Both father and son remain in intensive care at nearby hospitals

They were both raced to separate, nearby hospitals for treatment. Mr Alvarez, who has developed pneumonia and a blood clot is still unconscious and heavily sedated, according to WKMG in Orlando.

His son was taken out of the intensive care unit but was readmitted on Monday due to some difficulty breathing.

Their dog was also stung, leading to liver failure, but has since recovered.

'They will be lucky to survive this,' said Jim Kunze, a beekeeper who happened to live in the area where the two were attacked and came to their aid. 'They were attacked that viciously.'

After the attack, Jordan led his dad out of the woods to a road, where they managed to flag down Brien Schou, who rolled down his window to see what they needed. Wasps immediately flew into his vehicle.

'I was driving 
down the street and I saw a man and a boy stumbling out of the woods and
 stumbled across the road covered in bees,' said Mr Schou, who called 911.

Mr Kunze the beekeeper, who lived about a block away, heard people screaming for help and hopped in his truck to see what the fuss was.

'It was pretty bad. It was chicken pox times five, at least,' he said.

The pair were lucky this man, Jim Kunze, lived nearby. A beekeeper, he quickly began killing the wasps once he arrived on the scene

Mr Kunze got to work immediately. After putting Jordan inside his air-conditioned truck, he donned his bee outfit and began killing the wasps that continued to attack Mr Alvarez.

'I know he wanted to quit because he 
said, "I just wanted to give up because it hurt so bad, but I had to 
keep going because I seen daddy laying there on the ground." I just 
can't believe how strong he is,' said Jones of her son, adding that when she arrived at the scene she saw a yellow jacket crawling out of his ear.

Kunze said it was the dog that likely disturbed the wasps as he gamboled in front of the father and son.

'They've got guards at their entrance, and once the first 
one stings, it puts out a pheromone, it alerts the rest and the rest go 
to that point,' he said.
