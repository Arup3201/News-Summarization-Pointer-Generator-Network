Named and shamed: Labour councillor Theresa Gandy, 35, lost a legal fight to stay anonymous after she was found drunk in charge of a child

An Oxford-educated Labour politician has lost her year- long battle to gag the Press from reporting that she was arrested for being drunk in charge of her toddler.

Tess Gandy, 35, who had previously been cautioned for a similar offence, was hauled in front  of magistrates last May to answer for her crime.

But the former banking lawyer tried to prevent newspapers from identifying her and covering the case by applying for reporting restrictions.

After magistrates refused to grant the application, she ordered her lawyers to seek an injunction and apply for a judicial review to prevent details of the case ever emerging.

But the newspapers challenged the injunction in the High Court and judges have now ruled against  her, arguing that there was an ‘undeniable legitimate interest’ in reporting the case.

Gandy, who has been a councillor in Lowestoft, Suffolk, since 2011, has now resigned as she felt the ‘publicity’ meant she could not continue in her role.

Anti-censorship campaigners last night branded her actions a ‘classic attempt’ to abuse the right to privacy and prevent the public knowing the truth about her behaviour.

The district councillor fought to keep her identity secret for almost a year following her arrest in Asda in Lowestoft last April.

The store’s manager called the police after becoming concerned by Gandy’s behaviour while in charge of her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.

Her blood alcohol level was found to be four times the legal limit for driving a car.

Gandy, who was cautioned for a similar
offence in August 2011, was arrested. She was later fined £100 and 
ordered  to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £15.

Deep regret: Gandy said she felt she had let people down, and that she had used alcohol as a crutch to help her deal with post-natal depression and high levels of anxiety

During the hearing, Gandy’s solicitor, Mary-Anne Mir, asked magistrates to apply reporting restrictions to the case.

Gandy said she was seeking help for 
mental health issues and alcohol dependency and applied for an order 
under Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

The act is used to prevent the 
publication of information that might lead to the identification of any 
children – not adults – who are involved in criminal proceedings.

No evidence was provided about how the
child might be affected by its mother’s identification, other than that
it ought to be protected ‘from the serious impact of a press release on
this matter’.

The magistrates refused to grant the 
order, but Gandy’s lawyers served an injunction on the Lowestoft Journal
and its sister title the Eastern Daily Press, preventing any 
publication of the case.

They served an interim injunction 
because Gandy’s solicitors were seeking a judicial review over the 
decision by magistrates not to apply reporting restrictions.

They argued the child would be 
identifiable if the newspapers named Gandy, said she was a councillor 
without naming her, or said what she was charged with.

But the newspapers argued that it was 
in the public interest and in the interests of open justice to publish 
the details of her offence.

Drunk in charge: The manager of the Asda in Lowestoft became concerned about Gandy's condition while she was in the shop and called police who found she was four times over the drink-drive limit

Judges Mr Justice Kenneth Parker and 
Lord Justice Pitchford agreed and dismissed Gandy’s judicial review in 
their High Court judgment. Mr Justice Parker said: ‘The criminal 
conviction itself, although it attracted a relatively low penalty, was 
far from trivial.

‘To be drunk in charge of a small 
child of two-and-a-half years of age raises very considerable concerns 
regarding the general welfare of the child, especially when a caution 
had been administered not long before for the same offence.’

He said the caution – and the risk of 
public exposure – had failed to deter Gandy from committing the offence a
second time, which ‘strongly suggested there might be more serious 
underlying problems’.

He added that Gandy was ‘an elected 
councillor, and her conduct in public had twice fallen well below the 
standard that could reasonably be expected of an elected official by her
constituents and by the public generally, who had an undeniable 
legitimate interest in learning, through media publication, of how [she]
had behaved’.

He said that Gandy’s mental health 
problems and alcohol dependence were also details ‘which arguably the 
public were entitled to learn through a press report of proceedings’.

Padraig Reidy, spokesman for the Index
on Censorship campaign group, said: ‘It’s  a classic attempt to abuse  
the right to privacy to cover up misdemeanours.

‘This case is a matter of public interest and involves an elected official.’

Gandy said she had turned to drink to cope with post-natal depression and anxiety.

She said she had offered to resign at 
the time but claimed the Labour Party and Waveney District Council 
advised her she did not need to as it was a personal matter.

She added: ‘I sought legal advice to 
obtain an injunction to stop any printing of the story purely to protect
the privacy of my family and not for any personal reasons.’
