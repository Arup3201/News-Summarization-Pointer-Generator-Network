A homeless man has  admitted knocking a frail 92-year-old widower to the floor to steal just five pounds.

Stanley Evans, who lives on his own, was left lying on the ground for ten minutes after being attacked as he returned from a shopping trip in London.

Soloman Bygraves had followed the pensioner, now 93, into his block of flats in Soho, central London, and pushed him over as he lunged for his wallet.

The assault, which has been branded by police as 'totally unprovoked, callous and sickening', came just months after the elderly man had given his attacker £10.

Bygraves, 29, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at London's Southwark Crown Court via video-link from Wandsworth Prison. Wearing a grey tracksuit, he spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty. 

Mr Evans, who suffered an shoulder injury, eventually managed to get to his feet and take the lift to his flat to call 999. He did not require hospital treatment. 

The retired cameraman who worked on films including the 1947 classic Brighton Rock with Richard Attenborough - said he had been left 'flailing like a seal' after the attack.

Speaking before the arrest, Mr Evans described the attack: 'I've gone past anger, I'm frustrated. If I ever came across that one again I was a boxer and aggressive, if someone punches me I punch them back.'

'I was coming up to my flat from the supermarket with a trolley when I saw a large black man sitting on the wall, I vaguely recognised him as someone I had gave £10 to last year. I'm quite friendly with people in the area.

'He was even helpful with the trolley. I left him sitting on the wall and started fiddling with my key. Then he was behind me. He told me he had come to visit someone on the second floor.

'I let him in behind me and I called the lift. My wallet was in the front pocket of my trousers. Then suddenly whoosh, he came straight at me. He grabbed my wallet, pushed me over and I fell on my side and he ran out.

'When you fall over at my age every bit of your body hits the ground, I was flailing like a seal. It's almost impossible to pick yourself up.

'I waited 10 minutes for someone to come but nobody did. Then I managed to struggle to my feet and go up to my flat and call the police.'

The assault and robbery took place at Ingestre Court, central London at around 8pm on Saturday, 31 January.

The callous robber then casually walked from the scene, leaving Mr Evans stricken on the floor

Helen Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'This case involves the robbery of a 92-year-old man who was returning to his home address after a shopping trip and was set upon by the defendant in the lobby area of his block of flats.

'There are fairly lengthy antecedents. There is also CCTV footage covering the incident. It is my view your lordship would wish to see this prior to sentencing.'

John Causer, defending, said Bygraves had a lengthy criminal record, including three convictions for robbery.

He said: 'The court will wish to consider the issue of dangerousness.

'There is a background of mental health issues and drug issues.'

Mr Evans said he is determined not to let the mugging scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years

Mr Evans said Bygraves had waited by the entrance to his block of flats and claimed he was going to visit someone but as soon as the pensioner let him in, he mugged him

Judge Alistair McCreath remanded Bygraves in custody to be sentenced on April 13. He also ordered pre-sentence reports.  

Mr Evans, originally from Cardigan in Wales, once worked as an assistant cameraman at Welwyn Studio, where his first feature was John Boulting's 1947 adaptation of Brighton Rock, starring Richard Attenborough, before moving to MGM Studios in Borehamwood.

After the film studio closed down in the 1970s he set up as a freelance photographer in a studio in Marshall Street in Soho, where he captured celebrities including Michael Crawford.

He is determined not to let the mugging scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years.

He said: 'It doesn't scare me though. I'm not going to hide away in my flat because of him. I'm glad I live in Soho despite men like him.'

The CCTV footage showed Mr Evans being followed by Bygraves as he returns from the shops into the block of flats where he lives.

Pushing a small shopping trolley, the frail victim is seen waiting in a communal entrance for the lift to his flat as the robber approached him. 

The attacker then grabs his pocket and pushes him to the floor and footage shows the shocked pensioner collapsed in the communal area as he waits for help to come.

As a result of the assault the pensioner suffered a shoulder injury, which was treated by an ambulance crew. 

Detective Sergeant Gemma Alger of the Westminster Serious Crime Unit said: 'This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner.

'The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out.' 

The court heard that Bygraves had a lengthy criminal record, including three convictions for robbery

The 29-year-old of no fixed abode also had a background of mental health issues and drug issues

Bygraves entered his guilty plea has been remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing next month
