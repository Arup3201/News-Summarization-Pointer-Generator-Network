Disturbing pictures have emerged showing New South Wales firefighters humiliating one of their colleagues who was moving to another station.

The images feature a member of staff at NSW Fire and Rescue headquarters in Sydney who was shackled to the back of a firetruck as part of a farewell 'ceremony'.

He was then sprayed with a water hose, followed by a fire extinguisher before having highly corrosive oven cleaner applied to his head and neck, it is claimed.   

'Farewell ceremony': Disturbing images have emerged this week from a former firefighter, which he claims depict a staff member being humiliated at the NSW Fire and Rescue headquarters on Castlereagh Street in Sydney

The photos were taken by a former firefighter, who did not take part in the ceremony.

He told the Daily Telegraph that the victim, who was being re-stationed in regional NSW, soon collapsed on the ground in agonising pain, struggling to breathe.

'The poor guy couldn’t breathe and they threw soda ash all over him to try and stop the oven cleaner burning his skin,' the anonymous photographer said.

An ambulance was called to the HQ in Castlereagh Street and paramedics gave the man oxygen. He refused to go to hospital, instead opting for a shower.

It is unclear when the incident took place. However, it is not the first time the station has come under the spotlight.

It was revealed last week that another firefighter, Ron Moor, was suing Fire and Rescue NSW for more than $1 million.

He alleges that he suffered physical and mental harassment since his own initiation ceremony in the 1980s which led to a breakdown in 2007.

The photographer said the man, who did not make an official complaint, was tied between two fire trucks, sprayed with a water hose followed by a fire extinguisher and finally a caustic cleaning agent before collapsing and struggling to breathe

In the wake of Mr Moor's claims, seven more firefighters have contacted his lawyers to complain about their treatment.

It also prompted the anonymous photographer who took these images to come forward.

The former firefighter claimed he defied the orders of a high-ranking officer to hand over and destroy the photos, purposefully giving him the wrong memory card.

'This wasn’t the only incident. They happened all the time. Sometimes you would be called out to a fire in the early morning and you’d find a naked firefighter chained to the truck. You’d have to cut him free before you could get on the road,' he said.

'The mob mentality in there was just out of control. And the senior offices did nothing about it.'

Fire And Rescue NSW have not yet been available for comment.
