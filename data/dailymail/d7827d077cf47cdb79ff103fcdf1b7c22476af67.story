Tory activists launched a coded attack on Conservative Party Chairmen Grant Shapps and Andrew Feldman yesterday, demanding the right to pick their own chairman.

The Conservative Grassroots group - a collection of former constituency chairmen and council leaders - said new blood is needed to inspire Tory activists to campaign for the party.

They accused senior Tories of alienating ordinary party members and warned that the collapse in Tory Party membership will not be arrested if senior figures keep ‘insulting’ party members.

Lord Feldman, an old friend and tennis partner of David Cameron, was accused of branding Tory activists ‘swivel-eyed loons’ earlier this year.

The Prime Minister’s support for gay marriage has been blamed for halving Tory membership since the general election.

Some Tories in Westminster are also gunning for Mr Shapps, with several MPs and advisers predicting he might be replaced if the Tories finish behind the UK Independence Party in the European elections next May.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Education Secretary Michael Gove, Energy Minister Michael Fallon and Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, are all touted as possible replacements.

The intervention comes after Party membership is believed to have collapsed to just 100,000, the lowest level since the Second World War.

The group warns that if the dramatic fall in party membership is not reversed, there will be no one left to deliver leaflets, knock on doors, or raise money to support election campaigns.

Robert Woollard, Conservative Grassroots Chairman, said: ‘Mr Cameron must take decisive action if the current situation is to be reversed and this must include allowing members a real say in electing a new Party Chairman.

In a swipe at Lord Feldman, Mr Woolard said the PM ‘ must take action against any party official, or parliamentarian who thinks it is fine to insult ordinary members by calling them “swiveled eyed loons”.’

He called on Mr Cameron to ‘stop promoting unpopular policies such as same-sex marriage, HS2, uncontrolled fracking and on shore wind farms’, if he wants to ‘re-engage with ordinary people and party members.

‘He also should take immediate action to honour the manifesto commitment to give married couples a realistic tax break in order to help to strengthen the family and stop penalising stay-at-home mothers.’

In an attack on Mr Shapps, who some Tories see as a captive of Downing Street, Ed Costelloe, former chairman of the Somerset and Frome Conservative Association said party bosses ‘at national and regional level must do more to represent the views of the grassroots rather than being absorbed by the Prime Minister’s circle.’

Mr Woolard added: ‘To secure a majority in the 2015 general election the Conservative Party must re-establish its local grassroots support. Otherwise the numbers will not be there on the ground to do what needs to be done.

‘A General cannot win a war without experienced troops on the ground.’
