A judge has ruled that the Department of Veterans Affairs was justified in firing the former director of its Phoenix, Arizona, office, but not because of delays in care and secret waiting lists that consumed the agency this year.

Instead, the VA had the grounds to fire Sharon Helman over 'inappropriate gifts' she received from a health care consulting organization, including a trip to Disneyland 'in excess of $11,000,' tickets to a Beyonce concert and entry for the Mississippi Blues marathon, Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen C. Mish said.

Helman was removed from her job after the Phoenix VA became the epicenter of a national scandal over the quality of care for veterans amid allegations that patients were dying while waiting to see a doctor. She appealed her firing on several grounds, and the court ruled against her this week.

A judge has ruled that the Department of Veterans Affairs was justified in firing her, but not because of delays in care and secret waiting lists that contributed to the deaths of more than 40 veterans

A VA investigation found that at least 40 patients died while awaiting for appointments in Phoenix. Officials could not 'conclusively assert' that the delays caused the deaths, however. 

The judge also found that Helman could not be fired because of the secret lists and long wait times, saying the VA did not prove that Helman knew about her employees' covert system. 

Julie Perkins, Helman's lawyer, said the former director was 'scapegoated to appease Congress' but was happy the judge didn't find her at fault for any of the allegations of secret wait lists and patient deaths. 

Her law firm said in a statement that the judge's decision set the 'sets story straight.'

'Sharon Helman did not kill veterans. Sharon Helman did not manipulate wait time data. The VA’s preferred storyline has been proven a fabrication, of which the VA was aware the entire time,' Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. said.

Several whistleblowers had accused Helman of ordering the manipulations for personal benefit so that she would receive large bonuses from the VA, something Helman has steadfastly denied.

'She was completely vindicated of that,' Perkins said.

The VA also issued a statement in which it touted the many reforms it has implemented in recent months, including reaching out to 4,000 vets to accelerate their care and scheduling many more appointments.

'We are making progress in improving access to care at Phoenix and VA facilities nationwide, and we are pleased that [the] decision today helps us begin to put the leadership failures at Phoenix behind us,' it said.

Congressman Jeff Miller, chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said that the ruling serves as a reminder that additional employees at the Phoenix VA who had direct knowledge of and participated in the secondary wait list system must still be brought to justice.

'While I am glad the MSPB upheld Sharon Helman’s firing, the fact that the ruling did not connect the central figure of VA’s wait time scandal to any wait time schemes demonstrates a huge problem with the way this case was handled,' he told the Washington Post.

'Additionally, this decision highlights how there are many other Phoenix VAMC employees who have contributed to the facility’s problems. It’s absolutely critical that VA take steps to ensure these individuals are held accountable as soon as possible to the maximum extent under the law.'

Miller also called for a 'detailed investigation' into whether Veterans Affairs Department official in Washington, D.C. 'knew about widespread wait time fraud and when they knew it.'

'VA leaders owe it to our veterans and America’s taxpayers to seek answers to these unknowns,' he said.

Former VA Director Eric Shinseki resigned in May at the height of the scandal and has since been replaced by Robert McDonald. 

McDonald said last month that his agency planned to take 'aggressive, expeditious disciplinary action, consistent with the law' against more than 1,000 VA employees involved in cover-ups of how long patients were waiting to be seen by doctors.

A judge ruled this week that Helman could not be fired from her job at this VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, because of the secret lists and long wait times, saying the VA did not prove that she knew about her employees' covert system

Helman's lawyer declined this week to comment  to the Associated Press on the allegations that Helman had been receiving gifts from a lobbyist 'seeking to do business' with the VA in violation of the department's policy because of a separate ongoing criminal grand jury proceeding  happening now in Phoenix.

The judge for the Merit Systems Protection Board found that Helman accepted nine improper gifts from Dennis 'Max' Lewis, vice president for Jefferson Consulting Group.

The gifts included airfare around the country, notably a trip to Disneyland 'in excess of $11,000 for what appears to be six of her family members for an 8-night stay' and $729.50 for five tickets - and parking - to an August 2013 Beyonce concert.  

The consulting group had clients with government health care contracts or were seeking such deals, and the judge said Helman should have known it was wrong to take gifts from such a group.

'I find it difficult to believe that she accepted over $13,000 in gifts from Lewis over a two-year period ... without knowing what he did for a living,' Mish said.

The judge also cited an email exchange between Helman and Lewis in which the then-director said 'Whoooo hoooo!' after the consultant said he was taking care of a marathon trip.

Until Helman was fired in late November - more than six months after her hospital came under scrutiny - she continued to receive an $170,000 annual salary even though she was on administrative leave.

A new law passed in the wake of the matter ensures that an offending executive at the VA would be removed swiftly be from a position of power and knocked off the government payroll if similar circumstances were to arise in the future.

Now employees have just seven days to appeal their firing to the the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the board must make its decision within 21 days, confining the entire proceedings to a single month.
