A mother and daughter today told how they were glassed in the head after spurning a clubber's advances as police issued CCTV images of a man wanted over the attack.

Nicole Hill, 20, had been enjoying a Friday night out in Benjamin’s Bar in Halesowen, West Midlands, with her 47-year-old mother Lorraine when they were set upon in the early hours of November 16, last year.

Moments earlier Ms Hill had refused to dance with the man.

After threatening the pair with an empty 
Budweiser bottle the thug punched Lorraine - who fell to the floor 
dragging her daughter down with her.

He then smashed both women over the head with the upside down bottle as they cowered on the dancefloor.

The mother and daughter were rushed to hospital and needed stitches to treat deep lacerations to their heads.

Today, they spoke out about the terrifying attack and released pictures of their injuries in a bid to try and catch the thug - who ran from the club after the incident.

Nicole, who has been with her boyfriend Craig Tether, 23, for three years, said: 'We were out with a couple of my mum’s friends, it was just a normal night out.

'When it happened it was just me and my mum on the dancefloor because one friend was at the bar and another was in the toilet.

'We were just dancing and he came up to me and was trying to dance but I was having none of it as I have a boyfriend and kept backing away.

'Because he was with his mates he started to get a bit cocky. He was sticking his fingers up behind my back.

'I put my arms up as if to say "what are you doing?" and he kept sticking his fingers up.

'Next thing we know I turned around to look at him and he had a Budweiser bottle in his hand but it was upside down.

Trauma: Lorraine Hill, 47, had been enjoying a night out with her daughter when she was smashed in the face

Bloodbath: The blood-stained dress of glassing victim Nicole Hill shows just how serious the wounds to her head were following the attack

'My mum had stepped in front of me to push me back away and from then on it is all a bit of a blur.

'We are guessing my mum was hit on the head and she dropped to the floor.

'It basically knocked her out and as she fell she pulled me down to the floor.

'He was on top of us and he hit my mum first over the head because she had a piece of glass in her head.

'And then he hit me second. I can remember someone picking me up and panicking and I had no idea what was going on.

Gash: Nicole Hill was rushed to hospital and needed stitches to treat deep lacerations in her head

'It looked like I had been slashed in the neck and it wouldn’t stop bleeding.'

Lorraine added: 'We were both on the dancefloor and I saw him pick up a bottle and I said to Nic "lets go back to our corner, he's not worth it".

'I remember holding Nic's arm and pulling her down and I think that's when he attacked us.

'He hit the bottle over my head and I collapsed on the floor unconscious.

'I can remember trying to hold on to him and having material in my hands. It was a woollen jumper and I ripped it.

Nicole
 needed seven stitches for a four inch gash on the back of her head 
while mum Lorraine had an inch-and-a-half gap on the top of her head 
glued back together.

West Midlands Police released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with the horrific assault.

Nicole, who lives with retail worker Lorraine in Halesowen, added: 'It has just been awful.

'It’s really hard for me to have my hair up because I have a massive scar.

'My mum is still off work, she has been really affected by it. She hasn’t been out since it happened.

'I’ve been out for people’s birthdays but I won’t go out unless it’s a special occasion.

'It’s shook both our confidence.'

In December last year a 26-year-old local man was arrested, but was subsequently released without charge.

Detective Constable Dave Hackett, from West Midlands Police, said: 'I am convinced that someone would have seen the incident and remembered this unprovoked attack on the dance floor of a busy club.

'I would also appeal to the friends of the attacker, whom I believe were present, and will have key information which can assist our investigation.

'This attack has been a life changing event for the mum and her daughter and I would urge anyone who can help to contact us immediately.'

Witnesses are urged to call DC Hackett on 101 or alternatively information can be given anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
