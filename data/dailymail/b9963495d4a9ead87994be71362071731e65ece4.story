A mother tricked her local community and even her husband into believing her 5-year-old daughter was dying of terminal cancer and raised over $1,000 in the process.  

Leatha Kaye Slauson of Atlantic, Iowa was arrested this week after local authorities discovered her 5-year-old daughter Riley wasn't actually dying of colorectal cancer.

The 30-year-old mother-of-five started spreading the lie back in September 2013, shaving little Riley's head and even medicating her with unnecessary cannabis oil.

The local community rallied around the Riley, raising money and even paying for the family's trip to Walt Disney World.

The ruse was brought to light last week when administrators at Riley's school started looking into what special care she might need and realized inconsistencies with the mother's story.

Slauson first started the story last fall, and even went on television in the spring to talk about her daughter's so-called bucket list.

Plenty of time: In April, local firefighters invited Riley to tour their station and take a ride in the truck as part of her 'bucket list'

Firefighter-obsessed Riley was brought into the local station to ride around in a fire truck for a day, and her mother talked to local reporters about her daughter's 'illness'.

'(The cancer) is just spreading too fast,' Slauson told KETV back in April. 'It spread to her liver and the last MRI (showed) it spread to her lymph nodes and they stopped chemotherapy.'

It also appears Slauson medicated Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil, and even posted a picture of the girl on her Facebook, sucking at an oral syringe commonly used to dispense the drug.

The little girl subsequently tested positive for THC. 

Drugs: Slauson has also been charged for medicating Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil. She posted this picture of the little girl sucking on an oral syringe to Facebook. Oral syringes are commonly used to dispense cannabis oil

Local authorities held a press conference On Friday after Slauson's arrest and said it appears she was the only person involved in the crime, saying her husband and four other children were convinced of the ruse as well.

They wouldn't say the total funds Slauson conned from the community, but it's thought to be over $1,000. Those funds have since been frozen, but a GoFundMe page still exists online for donations as of Saturday. 

Authorities are now asking community members to stop sending money to the fake charity.

'I don't think the hearts of this community will he hardened by this,' local Police Chief Steve Green said.

Following Slauson's arrest, Riley and her four other children are being cared for by their father. Cass County Attorney Dan Gesitner says the father is 'struggling with how to proceed in his life'.

Slauson faces charges of child endangerment and distribution of drugs to a child under 18.

The Atlantic Police Department, Cass County Sheriff's Office, Cass County Attorney and Iowa Department of Human Services are investigating.

Paid for: Authorities haven't released a full total of the funds Slauson solicited under the guise of charity. Above, a picture of Riley and her family on a vacation to Walt Disney World provided for by community members
