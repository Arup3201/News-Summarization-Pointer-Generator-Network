It was, perhaps, Britain’s greatest military victory – the ferocious confrontation that finally ended the tyrannical reign of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Yet 200 years after the Battle of Waterloo, astonishingly there is still no memorial on the site to commemorate the remarkable bravery of the British troops who fought and died there – although there is a memorial to the defeated French.

Now that injustice is finally about to be righted. A monument designed by sculptress Vivien Mallock will be opened on the battlefield in Belgium next year.

Victory: The memorial depicts British soldiers struggling to close the gates at Hougoumont

The work will feature two British soldiers and quotes from the Duke of Wellington, who led the British forces, one reading, ‘Next to a battle lost the greatest misery is a battle gained’, the other saying, ‘Never was a place more fiercely assaulted nor better defended’.

Standing just over 6ft high, the memorial commemorates the moment when a predominantly British contingent of 4,000 soldiers defended the pivotal location of Hougoumont Farm and its surroundings from a vastly superior French force.

The lack of an official memorial for British troops has been a sore point for decades and has fuelled speculation that successive British governments and the Belgium authorities have been reluctant to push the issue for fear of upsetting the French. By contrast, the French have had a memorial on the site – called The Wounded Eagle – since 1904.

A political impasse that had long delayed the construction of a British memorial was recently solved when the Belgian authorities agreed on condition that Project Hougoumont, the charity behind the memorial, raised the funds necessary to restore the farmhouse that was at the centre of the Hougoumont fighting and turn it into a state-of-the-art visitor centre.

The property had fallen into a state of disrepair, despite being protected under Belgian law.

The fundraising, which is now complete, included a £1 million donation from the British Government. Both the farmhouse and the memorial will open to visitors from June.

Barry Van Danzig, chief executive officer for Project Hougoumont, said the memorial was to commemorate every British soldier who had fought and died at Waterloo.

‘It is now 200 years since the Battle of Waterloo and there are monuments on the field to the Prussians, the French, the Dutch and the Hanoverians,’ he said.

‘In fact, every nation that was there is commemorated except the British.

‘It is absolutely right that these magnificent men are commemorated and we have been very proud to have played our part.’

Hougoumont Farm was pivotal in the Battle of Waterloo, which took place in June 1815. It was almost captured by Napoleon’s forces when a French lieutenant smashed through its North gate with an axe.

Forty French troops made it on to the site but the enemy advance was halted when a handful of British troops rushed headlong into the group to repair and close the gate.

All the Frenchmen who made it into the farm were eventually killed, with the exception of a drummer boy.

The farmhouse’s restoration includes a new North gate made of timber supplied from Petworth, the Sussex home of Lord Egremont, who is a descendant of Henry Wyndham, a lieutenant involved in the brave struggle to close the breached gate at the farm.
