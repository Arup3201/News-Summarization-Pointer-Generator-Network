Victim: Elizabeth Thomas, 17, was stabbed to death on Friday in Oxted, Surrey

The devastated family of an A-level student who was stabbed to death have spoken of their loss, saying 'we have lost our Sunday child'.

Elizabeth Thomas, 17, died from a stab wound at a property in Oxted, Surrey, last Friday. A 16-year-old boy, arrested on suspicion of murder has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

In a statement issued through Surrey Police, her family said: 'Elizabeth was a kind, caring, loving and gentle girl and her death has left our lives broken beyond repair, we have lost our Sunday child.

'Throughout her GCSEs, Elizabeth studied hard and did very well. She was now working towards her A-levels and we were all extremely proud of what she had achieved.

'Following Elizabeth's death we have been truly overwhelmed by the messages and support we have received from everyone who knew her.'

They paid particular tribute to Elizabeth's friends and friends of her younger sister, saying they had shown 'a great sense of maturity and respect'.

In the traditional folk song Monday's Child, 'the child who is born on the Sabbath Day. Is bonny and blithe and good and gay.'

Detectives from the Surrey and Sussex major crime team have previously said the death of Elizabeth was an 'isolated incident'.

They said the property where Elizabeth was found stabbed would be the focus of police activity for 'the coming days'.

Elizabeth, who grew up in West Wickham, south-east London, was a student at Oxted School, a mixed comprehensive with more than 2,000 pupils, one of the largest secondary schools in the country.

Students were told about the tragedy this week and counselling was being made available to them, according to executive head Rhona Barnfield.

Ms Barnfield said this week that the school community was 'deeply saddened and upset' by the death of Elizabeth.

In a statement, she said: 'We are deeply
 saddened and upset by the tragic news about the death of one of our 
students and we extend our sincere condolences to her family at this 
very difficult time.

The victim's parents described her as 'a kind, caring, loving and gentle girl'

'We have informed our students and made counselling and support available to any of them who have been especially distressed.

'As a police investigation is ongoing, there is nothing more we can add at this time.'

One neighbour said the suspect suffered from autism, adding: â€˜I often see him.  He never speaks, he always just keeps his head down.â€™

The victimâ€™s body was discovered in a flat above a supermarket in Oxted, Surrey, by police shortly after 5pm on Friday.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Claire Pridgeon said: 'This is a complex investigation which will no doubt continue for some time.

'We believe this to be an isolated incident and that there is no risk to the further community.

'I would like to thank the community of Oxted who have assisted with the investigation so far.'

Shocked neighbours described how police suddenly descended on the street shortly after 5.20pm on Friday evening.

One said: 'It's a very unusual occurrence in a place like Oxted. It's shocking and sad a young girl has lost her life.'

The 16-year-old boy was initially arrested on suspicion of murder under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act.

He has been transferred to a secure hospital while he remains on police bail, a spokesman for Surrey Police has said.
