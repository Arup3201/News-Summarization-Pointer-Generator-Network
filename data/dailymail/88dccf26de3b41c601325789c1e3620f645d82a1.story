She is the neighbour from hell with a love of late-night drumming.

Now Joann Dunmore, 66, has been handed an interim ASBO, after terrorising her neighbours - including Reggie Kray's 'adopted son' Peter Gillett.

Joann Dunmore. 66, has been handed an ASBO after disturbing neighbours with sounds of late-night drumming and flowerpots smashing. Peter Gillett, a former gangster, said Dunmore is too much even for him

Mr Gillett described Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe as an 'absolute saint' compared to the 66-year-old who he said has terrorised his peaceful town.

The former gangster said he had met some 'real monsters' in Belmarsh Prison, south east London yet he says inmates can't compare to the pensioner who he describes as the nastiest and most spiteful person I have ever met in my entire life.'

Dunmore was handed an interim ASBO last month over complaints that she screams abuse, smashes flowerpots and even plays the drums in the middle of the night at her home in Littlehampton, West Sussex. She will be sentenced later this year.

The town is known for picturesque beaches and wildlife spots.

On Thursday, the pensioner also pleaded guilty to a separate charge of racially aggravated harassment at Chichester Crown Court.

Mr Gillett, 55, who lives next to Dunmore described the pensioner as an 'evil woman'.

He said: 'She's affecting my health and I've had to turn to drink to keep me sane. Ten years ago, I would have been on the rampage by now.'

Mr Gillett said that the woman had attempted to intimidate him. But he said: 'Maybe she doesn't realise who I am or what I've done. I've stabbed people in prison, for God's sake.

'I've just got to get away from her as soon as possible.'

Gillett was a self-proclaimed friend of the Kray brothers, Reggie (L) and Ronnie (R). Gillett did time with Reggie Kray in Parkhurst and Maidstone prisons and became the notorious gangster's 'adopted son', even recording a song co-written by Kray

The weightlifter was put behind bars in 1982 after his armed gang was caught trying to hold up a post office.

Parkhurst and Maidstone prisons and became the notorious gangster's 'adopted son', even recording a song co-written by Kray.

After his release in 1987, he was back 
behind bars five years later when undercover police raided a
drug deal involving opium stolen from the Ministry of Defence.

Most recently, Gillett was caught with bag of heroin at his home during a police raid.

Yet despite insisting he has never 'grassed anyone up', Gillett begged police to stop his neighbour's reign of terror.

Speaking when Dunmore was at her worst, Gillett said: 'She just terrorises me.

'I have sat next to the Ripper on a prison visit to see Ronnie Kray - but even he doesn't compare to this old bird.

'It just never stops, drunken abuse, swearing - the lot. I just can't stand it anymore.'

Last year, Dunmore, who describes herself
 as an author, denied she was the neighbour from hell - and said she was 'certainly not scared' of Peter.

Dunmore said of Gillett: 'He says he was an armed robber but I haven't seen any proof of that. He's just got it in for me'

She
 said: 'I don't care what he's done or where he's been. I have done a 
lot of things in my life and he doesn't worry me at all.

'He says he was an armed robber but I haven't seen any proof of that. He's just got it in for me.

'All I'll say is that this isn't over. In fact it's only the beginning.'

But Gillett admits that his neighbour's behaviour has improved. He said: 'She seems to have calmed down a lot after she got the ASBO, so that's a blessing.

'I don't know how long it will last though. Evil is as evil does.'

Dunmore will be sentenced for the racially aggravated harassment charge next month.

She is also set to face court for other offences when the temporary anti-social behaviour order ends in June.
