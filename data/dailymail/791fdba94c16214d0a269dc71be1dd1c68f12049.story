The oldest known Roman camp has been discovered in Italy's northeastern border, revealing clues to how the ancient civilisation gained its military prowess.

Italian scientists say the fort may have been used to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago and possibly paved the way for the modern Italian city of Trieste.

Researchers discovered the structure, built in 178 BC, using Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) – a technology which uses pulsed lasers to measure distances to the Earth.

Lidar  revealed the oldest known Roman military camp called San Rocco.  Italian scientists say the fort may have been used by to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago, paving the way for what is today the city of Trieste

A scanner was placed aboard a helicopter which then flew over parts of Muggia Bay. A laser then sent out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second.

A sensor recorded the light to measure a range, which was combined with position and orientation data from GPS to create a 3D map.

The method allows researchers to reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways.

'After seeing the image of the first Roman camp, [Federico Bernardini] ran to the site, 30 minutes from our institute, to search for direct evidence,' study co-author Claudio Tuniz, from the Fermi Center in Rome told Live Science.

'After a brief stroll through the site, he found clear signatures of the Roman period.'

These included hobnails used to make the military shoes of Roman soldiers and fragments of Roman amphorae, widely used to store oil, wine and other food products.

Flying above the intended target area, Lidar works by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second.

When a laser is pointed at a targeted area on the ground, the beam of light is reflected by the surface it hits. 

A sensor then records the light to measure a range. When laser ranges are combined with position and orientation data from GPS the result is a dense, detail-rich 3D map. 

The pulsed light can reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways. 

Lidar mapping was originally used to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. 

Around 32 acres (13 hectares) in size, the structure was defended by fortifications, such as ramparts up to about 80 feet (25 metres) wide.

The main fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles (2km) from the shore of the Bay of Muggia, and was flanked by two minor forts either side.

The fort was built in 178 BC, making it several decades older than any other Roman fort ever found.

Up until now, the oldest Roman military camps found had been located in Numantia and Pedrosillo in Spain, dating to 154 B.C. and 155 B.C., respectively.

The find has excited researchers studying the Roman Empire as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second Istrian War.

The early Romans were keen to protect a settlement called Tergeste - which grew to become Trieste - from the people to the north which the Romans referred to as pirates.

The Romans lost the first war, and the building of the fort suggests they were quite serious about winning the second.

The hope is that further study of the fort will offer clues about the very beginnings of the Roman army and how it came to become such a powerful force.

Archaeologists also say that further analysis could lead to direct evidence connecting the fort with a fort that mentioned by the Roman historian Livy.

Livy reported that the pirates found wine inside the camp and got drunk, and this helped the Romans reconquer the area.

Researchers now plan to do full-scale excavations at the site.
