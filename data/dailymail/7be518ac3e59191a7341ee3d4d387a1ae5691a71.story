Chinese tourists have been told to stay off commuter trains that run between central Paris and France’s largest international airport following a rash of robberies this year.

The Chinese embassy in Paris issued the rare travel warning this week, saying that it is following up on the cases with investigators.

Instead of taking RER trains the embassy is urging Chinese visitors to use buses, taxis or ‘other transport’ to travel between Paris’ tourist zone and Charles de Gaulle Airport north-east of the city centre.

Chinese tourists have been told to avoid the RER B train between central Paris and Charles de Gaulle Airport 

According to the embassy at least four robberies have occurred on RER B trains – which run almost 24 hours a day with frequent departures – since mid-February, the Hong Kong newspaper The Standard reported.

It said one tourist missed a flight home to China after his or her bag was stolen during the 40-minute train ride.

In other incidents, a young Chinese visitor suffered ‘a very huge loss’, and two tourists missed their flights home after they had property stolen.

Working as individuals or in groups, thieves have been targeting holidaymakers on trains and using distraction thefts.

In some cases one of the thieves will drop coins or other objects and the helpful holidaymaker has his or her property stolen while they help to pick them up. Some victims have had their bags snatched moments before the train’s doors close.

Miramar Travel general manager Alex Lee Chun-ting told The Standard that tours to France and the rest of Europe remain ‘incredibly popular’ and thefts are nothing new.

He said: ‘These types of thefts have been occurring for the past few years, but the Chinese government has only just decided to issue a travel warning.’ Thefts on the RER train system are not just limited to tourists, however.

Late last year Paris police reported an eight per cent drop in muggings against tourists 

According to The Local, the RER service has a reputation for being a crime hotspot, with a gang of about 20 thieves robbing numerous passengers in a planned attack last Sunday. It led to opposition politicians calling for heightened security measures at RER stations, including more CCTV.

Late last year Paris police announced that they had seen an eight per cent drop in the number of muggings involving tourists.

The French capital once said that it would bring in police from China to support a crime crackdown and assist Chinese tourists, but the plan has been put on hold.
