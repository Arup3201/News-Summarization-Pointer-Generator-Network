Sticky fingers led to a sticky situation early on Wednesday morning when a Southwest Florida man got stuck in a chimney as he was allegedly trying to break into another man's home.

Unlike Santa Claus, 25 year-old Richard Tyler Brandon was allegedly trying to break into Mike Whitley's home via the chimney to collect enough money for booze, not to grab a helping of milk and cookies.

Brandon ended up getting stuck halfway down the chimney and needed police assistance to free himself from the narrow chamber.

Brandon and friends were drinking at Pelican Larry's Raw Bar and Grill in Naples, FL when they realized they were out of cash.

Brandon's friend Derek Grenfell, 26, told the police that he warned his friend not to go down the chimney and told him, 'Dude, you're not Santa Claus, what are you doing.'

The Naples Daily News reports that Grenfell found police officers at a gas station nearby to where Brandon required help. They called for more police officers and firefighters to help Brandon break free.

When they arrived at Mike Whitley's home, which was unoccupied at the time, they saw a dirty and bare foot sticking out of the chimney.

It took officers two hours to get Brandon out of the chimney using a harness.

Richard Brandon was convicted on two counts of burglary and remained in jail until Thursday morning

'There is a chance he could have died. The space he was jammed into was really tight. He couldn't move,' said Naples detective Robert Young.

Brandon had difficulty breathing and complained of leg and back pain. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Both Brandon and his friend Grenfell were taken to Collier County Jail. They both remained in jail on Thursday morning. Brandon was charged on two counts of burglary charges and Grenfell was charged with two counts of burglary accessory.Â

Homeowner Mike Whitley maintained a sense of humor about the situation. He was away at his other home in Kentucky during the incident and was contacted early on Wednesday morning. The company that provides security at Whitley's home told him there was a man stuck in his chimney.

Mike Whitley thought that the call was a joke at first. He later said it was,'a reverse kind of Santa.'

The Bradenton Herald reports that Mike Whitley and his wife Faye were planning on returning home to Naples in the next few days. They wondered what would have happened had no one called for help.

'I think if we'd have come back Sunday, he'd still be yelling,' Whitley said. 'By Tuesday, no. Maybe an aroma.'

An employee at Pelican Larry's said she had not heard about the incident. Her manager refused to comment because they were in the middle of dinner service.
