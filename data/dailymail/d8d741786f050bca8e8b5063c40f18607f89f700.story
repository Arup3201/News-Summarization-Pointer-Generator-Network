The Navy is revoking former-sailor Bill Cosby's title of honorary chief petty officer, saying allegations of sexual abuse made against the comedian are serious and conflict with the Navy's core values.

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer Michael Stevens made the announcement Thursday in a statement.

'The Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navy's core values of honor, courage and commitment,' they said in a statement.

Cosby enlisted in the Navy in 1956 and served four years as a hospital corpsman before being honorably discharged in 1960 as a 3rd Class Petty Officer. The honorary title was presented to Cosby in 2011. 

The 77-year-old Cosby has refused to answer questions about mounting accusations that he sexually abused several women.

NBC recently scrapped a Cosby comedy that was under development, some of his appearances have been canceled and he has resigned from Temple University's board of trustees.

Scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape in October, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the former Cosby Show dad's dark side during a stand-up set. 

Since then, at least 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, have publicly accused Cosby of rape, with many saying he drugged them too. 

The allegations go all the way back to 2004 though, when a former Temple University employee went to authorities after  Cosby groped her. 

The case was eventually thrown out, with investigators saying there wasn't enough evidence to charge Cosby, so the woman filed a civil suit instead and four 13 other women to testify about Cosby's history of sex abuse. 

The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.
