Eleven people, including five members of Mexico's militarized police, were killed after a gunfight in the city of Ocotlan, Jalisco

Gendarmerie police had been patrolling the area of southwest Mexico when a pickup truck approached and opened fire. It is the deadliest attack on the forces since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office

Two thousand shell cases were found at the site of the gunfight, which lasted for half an hour and killed three bystanders

Three bystanders who apparently had nothing to do with the
ambush and three suspected gang members were also killed during a gunfight that lasted 30 minutes, according to AFP.

Seven vehicles of the new 5,000-strong gendarmerie were patrolling the town southeast of the
state capital Guadalajara, the commission said.

At least 10 vehicles took part in the attack on police, which began with assailants in a pickup truck firing with high-powered rifles before being
beaten back, the security commission said.

Some of the attackers continued to fire as they fled into Ocotlan, a town of around 90,000 people.

Authorities originally said that ten people had been killed, but added another bystander to the total late Friday, according to Cronica Jalisto. 

Two thousand bullet casings were reportedly found at the scene, which was riddle with bullet holes.

Authorities originally said that ten people had been killed in the gunfight, though it was later revealed that a third bystander had died

Ten vehicles (pictured) are thought to have participated in the attack on the gendarmerie, who suffered their deadliest attack since being created by the president

Police confiscated seven firearms and four fragmentation
grenades at the scene, as well as five vehicles believed to have
belonged to the assailants, the government said.

Three civilians killed wearing cartridge belts were assumed to be part of organized crime, and had tactical equipment on them.

Jalisco has been plagued by fighting between the Jalisco New
Generation drug cartel and the Knights Templar, a drug gang from
the neighboring state of Michoacan.

The gang in southwestern Mexico has been gradually
weakened by the capture or killing of its leaders.

More than 100,000 people have been killed in gang-related
violence in Mexico over the past eight years, many of them near the US border.

Bringing peace to Mexico was President Enrique Pena Nieto's
first promise when he took office in 2012. 

The gendarmerie was
unveiled to spearhead the government's efforts to restore order. 

It began operating last summer, albeit on a smaller scale than
first envisaged.

More than 100,000 people have died from gang violence in Mexico over the last eight years, though many of them were near the US border

Violence against the police took place on several streets of Ocotlan, a town of about 90,000 people in Jalisco state

The Jalisco New Generation has been weakened after authorities (pictured) captured or killed its leaders. However, violence still plagues the area.
