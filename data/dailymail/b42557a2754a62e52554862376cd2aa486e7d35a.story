It's usually cats getting their backs scratched.

But one paws-on feline from Bonita, California, decided to repay the favor with his own 'ultimate meow-ssage.'

Banks the cat was filmed as he caressed a woman's back and shoulders.

'How does it feel?' a man asks as the therapy session takes place.

'Fantastic!' the woman exclaims with a grin on her face.

To reach all the right spots, Banks hopped up on to a kitchen counter, with his customer stood in front.

He then proceeded to paw-rub away. 

The animal was previously listed for adoption by the San Diego Department of Animal Services.

However, he now appears to have gone to a good home. 

Banks' massage client explained that his relaxation techniques were a definite bonus.

'For sure, who doesn't like an in-house masseuse that works for catnip?' she said.
