Mario Balotelli could be on his way out of Anfield because he is 'more hassle than he is worth', according to former Liverpool star Jamie Redknapp.

Balotelli scored the only goal in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Besiktas, but in the process attracted controversy by grabbing the ball off captain Jordan Henderson to score from the spot.

And Redknapp believes his apparent lack of respect will leave Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers to decide he can do without the Italian striker.

'The problem you have with Mario is I don't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody,' said Redknapp on talkSPORT.

'He has worked with some of the best managers in (Cesare) Prandelli, (Jose) Mourinho, (Roberto) Mancini, everybody he has worked with has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it.

'The objective is to put the ball into the back of the net, thankfully that is what he did, but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field.

All was well in the end though when Balotelli fired the penalty into Cenk Gonen's bottom corner for a 1-0 win

Steven Gerrard called Balotelli disrespectful, and Redknapp said his team-mates don't enjoy his company

'He is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it, but it is that lack of respect that he has.'

Redknapp also suggested that Balotelli, who cost Liverpool £16million this summer and has scored just one Premier League goal, has not justified his place in the squad.

'I don't see long-term he will be at Anfield, I really don't,' continued Redknapp.

'He has scored a couple of goals in fairness, the goals against Tottenham and yesterday were important, but I am sure Brendan Rodgers is thinking he is more hassle than he is worth because he hasn't produced the quality you would like and when you look at other players around him they don't seem to enjoy his company on the field.' 

Balotelli sought out Henderson after scoring the goal and later thanked him with this Instagram post

Balotelli's actions  angered some of his team-mates, and the striker's long-term future could be in doubt
