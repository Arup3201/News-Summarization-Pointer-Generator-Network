'The man stripped off his clothes and left the socks on his feet. I looked from his wrinkled body up to his face. He kept smiling this friendly old man smile.

''"This is my first night," I said. "I could tell," he said. "I'm honoured". Then he told me that I reminded him of his granddaughter.'

For Holly Austen Smith, then just 14 years old, this episode marked the start of her short-lived career as a prostitute.

Overcoming adversity: Holly Austin Smith, now 36, has taken years to recover from the trafficking ordeal

Vulnerable: Holly, pictured in her middle school graduation photo, was 14 when she was trafficked

An unhappy teen growing up in Atlantic County, New Jersey, her ordeal began after being approached by a man who gave his name as Greg during a trip to a shopping mall.

Blinded by dreams of love and a job in the fashion or music industries, Holly, now 36, was easy prey for the unscrupulous sex trafficking gang in whose hands she ended up.

But while stories of Eastern European or Chinese girls being trafficked are all too common, Holly was a middle class girl from a sleepy American town.

So what went wrong? 'This is something I talk about a lot in my book,' explains Holly, now a happily married mother who lives in Richmond, Virginia.

'Often children who are trafficked have a background that is troubled in some way, whether sexual abuse in early childhood, domestic violence at home or  substance abuse.'

For Holly, the problems began when she was sexually abused by a much older cousin. The years of what she describes as 'mild abuse' led to problems with her parents, who she says made her spend time with her cousin, despite her protests.

'That followed through childhood and because of what happened with my cousin, I harboured resentment towards my parents,' she explains.

'That eventually led to a lot of anger between me and my parents and then at middle school, I fell into a bad crowd. I was what you would call a problem child.'

By the time she reached her early teens, Holly had become rebellious, running away from home on several occasions and dressing provocatively in a bid to gain attention.

Sadly for Holly, she did indeed become the subject of adult attention: the attention of a trafficking gang intent on exploiting the vulnerable teen.

'All children are vulnerable to crossing paths with traffickers,' adds Holly, whose book, Walking Prey, details how trafficking gangs choose their victim.

Troubled: Holly, pictured aged 14, had a troubled childhood and an uneasy relationship with her parents

'That day, that guy [Greg]  was standing in a payphone booth. I don't think he was really on the phone at all.

'I think he was scanning the crowd and when he saw me I was straggling behind my friends and dressed in a way that suggested I was looking for attention from older guys.'

The man approached her and flattered, she agreed to exchange phone numbers with him. He then spent the next two weeks chatting to the teenager over the phone, telling her she was special, beautiful and far too mature for school.

Holly was smitten. 'I was unhappy at home - I was coercable,' she remembers. 'Traffickers take time with victims, feeling them out and convincing them to run away.

'He told me things that made me feel good about myself; that I was pretty enough to be a model. He painted a picture of a glamorous lifestyle to me.

Advocacy: Since meeting a fellow survivor in 2009, Holly has become an anti-trafficking advocate

Important work: She travels around the world speaking about her experiences

'He told me things like he could introduce me to famous people, get me into clubs and get me a job in the fashion or music industries.'

Enraptured with the wonderful future that Greg appeared to be offering her, Holly agreed to run away with him less than two weeks after they met.

But things swiftly began to go wrong. Writing in Walking Prey, she details the shocking moment when she finally realised what Greg's intentions really were.

'Nobody said the word prostitution,' she writes. 'It just hung in the air. Everything was moving so quickly.

'Nobody asked me if I was OK with this, or if this was what I had signed up for, or if I wanted some time to think about it.

'Neither Greg or Nikki asked me anything at all. Nikki called for a taxi and the two of us were on the way to Atlantic City.'

What followed was horrifying. 'When the first man approached me, I 
don't even think I was thinking of anything,' remembers Holly.

'I was overloaded with info 
and completely out of my element. I just think that I was going through 
the motions.

'At 14, I didn't really have a solid idea of consequences and I still 
didn't completely understand prostitution. There were several men that 
night and the following night.'

In addition to the clients, the vulnerable schoolgirl was also raped by Greg.

But salvation was at hand in the form of a policeman who approached her on the street to ask how old she was.

Frightening: Most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue

Harrowing: Holly's book, Walking Prey, documents her experiences and is out now

At first, she stuck to the patter 
Greg had given her but as the policeman walked away, she called out to 
him. 'What if I wasn't [over 18]?' she asked.

'When the police officer walked
 away from me, I realised that if I didn't reach out and say something, 
this [prostitution] would continue,' she remembers.

'I
 knew if I didn't say anything, it would continue.' Just 36 hours after 
running away with Greg, Holly was back with her parents.

But her problems didn't end there. Her parents had no idea how to handle what had happened, and Holly herself needed years to come to terms with being trafficked.

'By the time my parents arrived [to collect her from the police station], I had emotionally shut down,' says Holly.

'My few memories of my parents around that time are not great. I don't think they knew 
how to handle the situation.

She adds: 'A lot of anti-trafficking organisations recognise that the parents and 
families if trafficking victims need support as well.

'They need to learn about what happened to their child, ideally before they're reunited with them. My parents didn't have that time so they didn't know how to handle it.'

For Holly herself, the process of overcoming what happened to her has been a long one. 'It took
 me many, many years to overcome it,' she says.

'We need to get survivors to realise that they are not at fault. I thought for a long time it was my fault because I chose
 to go with him.

'I thought what had happened to me was all my own fault. It took me a very long time to realise that it wasn't.'
