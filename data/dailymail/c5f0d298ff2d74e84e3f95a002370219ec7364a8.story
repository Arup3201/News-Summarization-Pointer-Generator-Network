A plunging neckline closing three inches below a woman's cleavage is the new super-low-cut trend being worn by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Rita Ora and Sienna Miller - but is it a look that's going to make it into the real world?

Kate Hudson, 35, was one of a handful of celebrities that dared to take the look to the red carpet, wearing an extremely revealing white gown,  slashed to the navel, at the Golden Globes on Sunday night. Sienna Miller and Jennifer Lopez also championed the look at the event.

Away from the red carpet. Kim Kardashian, 34, went bra-less on a night out in New York last week, refusing to   let the Arctic temperatures stop her from making a daring fashion statement and Rita Ora also caused a stir last Monday- and sparked more than 400 complaints - when she appeared on BBC1's The One Show  in a white blazer buttoned at the stomach with nothing underneath.

Can a 'real' woman pull off extreme cleavage look? Deni hits the streets in a revealing neckline to find out 

The trend - which is set to be big in 2015 - has been building for the last couple of months and fashion conscious stars including Miranda Kerr and Cara Delevingne used it regularly to spice up their wardrobe last autumn.

But while such a daring dress isn't out of place in the A-lister's wardrobe, what would it be like for the average woman to try out such a design - and what would the public's reaction be? FEMAIL put one writer to the test to find out.

Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, attempted to give Kate Hudson and Kim Kardashian a run for their money by trialling out the extreme cleavage trend - stepping out in Kensington High Street - the borough of London that counts the Royal family as locals - to find out what the reaction from the public would be.

For one of the main red carpet season events, of course J-Lo was in attendance and naturally, she looked as stunning as ever. It must be hard not to look good with as banging a body as J-Lo, but this is one woman who knows how to nail the red carpet.

She always accentuates her figure to the max and manages to show off plenty of skin without looking too risque and it was no different for this year's Golden Globes.

J-Lo stepped up to present Best Actor in a Mini TV Series award at the event and Fashion Finder couldn't help but lust after her sparkly dress, which featured a cape - one of the hottest trends this season. And of course, sparkles and glitter are so very Hollywood and expected of the red carpet events so this pick had it all.

We know everyone can't resist a sequin, so that's why we've rounded up some glittering numbers below, perfect for your next big event.

Kim Kardashian, 34, went bra-less on a night out with husband Kanye West  in New York last week, refusing to let the Arctic temperatures stop her from making a daring fashion statement

Speaking about the look - and whether she thought she could pull it off - Deni said: 'I feel very exposed - I don't mind showing cleavage created by a good push-up bra, but this plunging top is quite extreme.'

While Kim's garment is no doubt designer - and comes with a high-end price tag - Deni got dressed up in her daring black ensemble from New Look and H&M. 

'I feel quite sexy and confident, but also self-conscious,' Deni added.

Deni said that she felt quite sexy and confident in her plunging top in High Street Kensington, but also self-conscious in her revealing outfit

Eyes right! Deni got lots of attention from passers-by on the street in her cleavage-baring outfit

Deni attempted to emulate confident Kate as best she could with a photographer in tow, striding nonchalantly along in High Street Kensington on a very cold Friday afternoon - much to the amusement of passers-by.

Lucien Joyce, a 27-year-old from London, paid particular interest when he saw Deni walking past. 

He said: 'She's showing too much flesh for the temperature but she looks really nice and I like her outfit.'

So did he think Deni pulls it off better than Kate or Kim? 

Lucien said: 'A celebrity is a real woman at the end of the day, someone like Kim just celebrates her body more than the next person.

'If a lady wants to show off her assets like Deni is, then she should go for it.'

Deni received more than a few glances - especially from passing men. 

'You look amazing, love', 'are you a model?' and 'smoking' were just a few of the comments from gawping guys walking past.

An older lady who didn't want to be named added: 'She's young, she can get away with it, she's having fun', while a few school boys stopped to take some snaps on their mobile phones. 

One passer by, Martin, a 26-year-old who works in the music industry in London, stopped for a lingering glance.

He said: 'She looks great, I have absolutely no complaints about her look. 

'I don't think anyone can judge her and if you do, that says more about your character than her look.' 

'You look amazing, love', 'are you a model?' and 'smoking' were just a few of the comments that Deni got 

Deni bought her daring black ensemble from New Look and H&M and took it to High Street Kensington to find out what the reaction would be

Sharing his opinion, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Granted, Sienna, Kim and Kate gets chauffeured from one place to the next, and probably have an on-hand stylist with an iron, so their dresses will always look perfect. 

'But for us mere mortals, a plunging top or dress like this is possible with the same amount of glamour.

'As long as you are always on boob-watch, and have emergency tit-tape in your bag, you'll be fine and Deni looks amazing.' 

This isn't the first time that Kim or Kate have dared to bare and their fashionable friends Cara Delevingne, Gwyneth Paltrow and Miranda Kerr have all trialed the trend, too.  

Speaking about the new extreme cleavage fashion, celebrity stylist Claire Wacey, said: 'The trend to show off more cleavage is great provided you have a pert, toned bust. 

'If, however, your breasts do not defy gravity and require bras of steel to keep them in place do not attempt this trend.'

Passer by Martin, a 26-year-old who works in the music industry in London, stopped for a lingering glance at Deni

She continued: 'If attempting then ensure that you only show the curve of the bust, either in the centre or at the top rather than creating a pushed together "Bum Boob".

'Look for dresses that will separate and lift the bust so that the look remains classy.

'Invest in strong tit-tape, like Boots stock Eylure tit tape, which is great to keep everything in place.'

Simon added: 'Anyone can add a chic blazer over a gown, I've been suggesting this particular styling in my work for years. 

'It's super elegant, sophisticated and screams of power-woman, plus, it's a great option of jacket on a cold night out.

'I'd like to think that only those women with the "right" boobs for this dress would attempt it. 

'That's not to say there isn't something for everyone, but when they are on show like this, you need to think carefully if you can go without support.'

Rita Ora caused quite the stir when she appeared on The One Show to promote The Voice in a white blazer buttoned at the stomach
