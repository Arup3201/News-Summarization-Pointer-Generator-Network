This is the moment a dirt bike rider attempts to perform a Superman stunt, but it all goes horribly wrong.

The risk taker starts off well enough, gripping the seat of the bike as he prepares to execute the dangerous move.

His arms reach out to the air and for one split second it looks as if he’s got it cracked.

Attempting the Superman: Things start off well as the biker looks like he has everything under control

But at the pivotal moment, when he needs to get back on the bike, things start to go terribly wrong.

The rider misjudges the timing and reaches out for the seat, but instead of gripping it, his fingers clutch vainly at the empty air.

The slowed-down video shows every excruciating second of his frightening fall.

Disastrous: The stunt goes wrong and the biker comes crashing to the ground with a loud bang

His arms flail wildly as he realises that he’s not going to be able to get back on the seat.

Airborne, his body flips upside down and he comes crashing to the ground with a loud bang.

The biker manages to quickly get off from the ground and it doesn't seem like anything other than his pride is hurt.

The superman stunt involves a rider taking both feet off the pedals when airborne. 

The successful completion of the stunt is when a rider is able to kick their feet out behind them without letting go of the handle bars and flattening their bodies as much as possible so that they look like Superman as he flies.
