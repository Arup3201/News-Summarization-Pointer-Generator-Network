New Arsenal academy chief Andries Jonker said the club need to rip up their scouting structure and start afresh if they are to emulate Barcelona in developing young talent.

The 52-year-old Dutchman, who was an assistant to Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, said he was working closely with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on his plans for the academy.

In an out-spoken interview, which is likely to unsettle current staff at the academy, Jonker says that the set up which he inherited from Liam Brady requires a complete overhaul.

‘Arsenal want more talented players to come through, because that has been lacking,’ he said. ‘They want me to develop the players from the academy much better than it was done before.

‘At this moment, considering the investments the club have made, players have hardly been developed properly. This is why they wanted me, a man who can guide the coaches and who can influence the other coaches.

‘Ivan Gazidis [Arsenal chief executive] wants Arsenal to be the best academy in the world. He realises that will cost money and will take time, but that is his ambition.

‘The scouting must be restructured all over again. It needs to be brought to a level so that we can bring in the absolute best talents from abroad and from England at an age that Wenger can immediately work with them.

‘My chief scout at the academy, Steve Morrow, came and asked me what kind of players I wanted him to look for. So I said, the best player I have worked on, Xavi.’

In the interview with Voetbal International, Jonker said: ‘Almost every day Wenger and I go through a number of things. He is approachable, but I do have to show him what we are doing. We must not go behind his back.

‘It is important that Wenger and I work closely together. What I do see is that everybody at the club has the feeling that they need to have the green light from Wenger before they do anything. But maybe that is not the case.

‘I have a very good feeling about the way Wenger and I are working together. We both think the technical side of the game is very important.

‘But there are a lot of things in the academy which can be improved or should be done different.’

Jonker says that he has a relationship with Arsene Wenger that involves them speaking every day
