Bolton's favourite son Peter Kay has another award to his collection after one of his jokes was named the funniest one-liner ever.

The affable comedian from the North West saw of stiff competition to take the title ahead of the likes of comedy geniuses such as Tommy Cooper, Ricky Gervais and Rowan Atkinson.

Kay was awarded the title for his gag: 'I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she’d popped her clogs.'

Clogs: Peter Kay's (left) gag about a dutch woman has been named the funniest joke of all time by a survey. Tommy Cooper (right) took second and third places

The legend that was Tommy Cooper took second place with: 'Police arrested two kids yesterday, one was 
drinking battery acid, the other was eating fireworks. They charged one 
and let the other one off.'

One of the larger than life comic's gags also came third with: 'Apparently, one in five people
 in the world are Chinese, and there are five people in my family, so it
 must be one of them.

'It’s either my mum or my dad. Or my older brother, Colin. Or my younger brother, Ho-Chan-Chu. But I think it’s Colin.'

Researchers compiled 180 popular online jokes and asked 6,000 adults to vote for the top 50 funniest.

Benny Hill, Bill Bailey and Tim Vine also feature, along with Michael McIntyre and Sarah Millican.

A
 spokesman for paid for survey site 2Brewarded.co.uk, which commissioned
 the study, said: 'Britain clearly has a great sense of humour. Many of the jokes in top 50 are from true, British comic legends.

'Gags from comedy geniuses such as Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay and Tommy Cooper are all ranked highly.

Funny lass: Newcastle's Sarah Millican (left) featured on the list at number 35.  Co-creator of The Office, Ricky Gervais (right), also featured highly

'All of the jokes that made the final list are all genuinely funny and good natured which proves crude gags don’t really cut it.'

The array of topics reflects the modern era as well with gags about Google Plus, Facebook and Twitter all making the list.

Funny
 tales about marriage, famous icons and religion also cropped up in the 
poll while gags about families, money and food also appear in the list 
of our favourites.

The most
 popular joke about marriage turned out to be: 'Why do men get married? 
So they don’t have to hold-in their stomachs anymore.'

The
 favourite celebrity-based jokes revolved around Taylor Swift and her 
much-publicised boy troubles.

A spokesman for 2Brewarded.co.uk added: 'It’s hard to read through these jokes without a smile on your face.'
