A Texas man dramatically turned the tables on two bank robbery suspects who had abducted him and his wife on Thursday, by pulling a gun on the duo and shooting them both, killing one.

According to KHOU, the unnamed couple were targeted by brothers Jordan, 20, and Preston Kutach, 21, who knew that the woman worked at the First National Bank of Eagle Lake in Columbus, near Houston.

The suspects kidnapped the couple at gunpoint in their own home, then made them drive to the bank where they forced the woman to withdraw cash. But then her husband struck back with deadly force.

Counter attack: After the husband fired back, officers responded to a 911 call and found both suspects lying on the ground near the truck suffering from gunshot wounds

Columbus County Sheriff's Sgt. Andrew Weido told KHOU that once the brothers had stolen an undisclosed amount of money they forced the husband to drive south on Route 71.

It was then that the husband grabbed a gun that he had hidden in his truck and fired at the suspects, who were both residents of Rock Island, Texas.

The man is reportedly a reserve officer with the local sheriff's department.

Support: 'It's very positive to a community to hear that the good guy does win in the end,' local resident Evan Mullins said

The brothers were taken to different hospitals, where 21-year-old Preston was pronounced dead. Jordan remained hospitalized in critical condition over the weekend.

Those who know the couple said that the community has their back.

'I'm sure that they're both going to be upset for a while,' resident Brenda Buehler said. 'It's a frightening thing to have happen, but I think everybody's going to tell them good job.'

'It's very positive to a community to hear that the good guy does win in the end,' Evan Mullins told KHOU.
