Wanted by police: Mehmet Berker is said to have set fire to a cat and then posted a photo of its charred remains on social media

Police in Turkey are hunting a thug who set fire to a cat and then posted a photo of its charred remains on social media - offering a prize to anyone who could 'identify the animal'.

Vile Mehmet Berker, 24, uploaded the sickening image of the scorched body onto his Facebook account encouraging his friends to take part in his sick game.

Along with the picture, he wrote: 'If you can guess which animal this is, I will pay you 50 Turkish Liras [the equivalent of £12].'

He then wrote: 'I don't know why I did this, but, hey, it's a bit of a challenge and no one will miss it coz it was a  stray. Come on then, who's up for it.'

The account was quickly disabled by Facebook management but not before the image had been shared and tweeted hundreds of times.

Horrified viewer Murat Nas, 25, said: 'I was simply disgusted when I saw what he had posted.

'We aren't proper friends, only on Facebook. But how can anyone be so sick as to do this.

'I don't know if he actually set the poor cat on fire himself, but his comments certainly suggest he did.

'But either way it's still absolutely abhorrent. What sort of person would do this?'

Police are now looking for Berker and say although his Facebook account did not say where in Turkey he lived, he should be easy to locate.

A police spokesman said: 'Experts have analysed the photo and have concluded that it is a cat.

'When the offender is found and if he is guilty of killing the animal he will be fined as mistreating animals is merely a misdemeanor rather than a crime.'

Vile post: Along with the picture, he wrote: 'If you can guess which animal this is I will pay you 50 Turkish Liras. I don't know why I did this, but, hey, it's a bit of a challenge and no one will miss it coz it was a stray'
