Home grown: Fern Britton will present Grow, Make, Eat: The Great Allotment Challenge, a new six-part series which aims to repeat the success of The Great British Bake Off

The Great British Bake Off inspired thousands of viewers to dust off their oven mitts.

And now the BBC is hoping a new gardening show – called Grow, Make, Eat: The Great Allotment Challenge – will do for cabbages and cucumbers what Bake Off did for pies and pastries.

Presented by Fern Britton, the six-part series is expected to air on BBC Two in early 2014.

The programme will see nine  pairs of passionate gardeners putting their green fingers to the test as they attempt to harvest  a crop of vegetables and fruits, ready to be judged by a panel of experts.

Over the course of four months the contestants will meticulously plan, plant and nurture their allotments inside a beautiful walled garden on the Mapledurham estate in Oxfordshire.

They will then be put through their paces in a series of challenges – including flower-arranging and making jam – under the watchful eyes of the judges.

Each week the participants will be given scores based on how they perform in three trials which will be designed to test their horticultural knowledge, creativity and culinary skills.

And every episode will reflect the growing season, explaining to viewers what crops are ripe for picking at that particular time.

Royal Horticultural Society judge Jim Buttress, tipped to be the Paul Hollywood of the series, will be joined on the panel by floral designer Jonathan Moseley and cookery writer Thane Prince.

Building on the tradition of the annual horticultural show, with its competitions for jams, chutneys, fruits, vegetables and flowers, the programme is set to celebrate Britain’s love for gardening – and, of course, a good competition.

Experts are hoping that the series 
will inspire would-be gardeners to take to the great outdoors and grow 
their own vegetables – just like characters Tom and Barbara in The Good 
Life, who laughed their way through the ups and downs of their 
self-sufficient lifestyle.

Matthew
Appleby, author of the Allotment Planner, said: ‘It’s a big hope for 
everybody in the industry that this is going to make a garden boom time 
again in the same way Alan Titchmarsh’s show Ground Force did some years
ago.

‘The BBC has spent 
lots of money setting this up. But the difficulty with the concept is 
that while you can bake something in an hour or two, with gardening it 
takes weeks to grow anything.’

Over
the last few years, there has been a move towards grow-your-own food – 
with many council-owned allotments reporting lengthy waiting lists. And 
some city-dwellers have been making the most of limited space, with 
balconies and windowsills doubling as gardens.

The
BBC’s head of documentaries Emma Willis said: ‘We’re really excited 
about this fantastic new series which will tap into the wave of public 
interest in growing your own and crafts from chutney-making to floral 
arrangements.

‘With the 
cost of living continuing to rise, it’s the perfect time to make the 
most of our gardens and allotments and get growing.’

Popular: There has been a boom in the popularity of growing fruit and vegetables, with long waiting lists at many allotments

Self-sufficient: More and more people are taking up gardening, just like characters Barbara and Tom in classic BBC comedy, The Good Life

Success story: After The Great British Bake Off inspired thousands of viewers to dust off their oven mitts, the BBC is hoping to do the same for gardening gloves with its latest show

Cherry tomatoes are ideal to grow in window boxes

A lack of outdoor space need not deter a would-be gardener, with many varieties of plants suitable for even the smallest space.

Dwarf varieties of broad beans, which grow no more than 60cm are suitable for window boxes. The beans, pods and shoot tips can be harvested and then either eaten raw or cooked.

Chilli plants can be grown from seed indoors as long as they have a sunny spot to grown in. They like a moisture-retentive soil and gardeners can use tomato feed to encourage the plants to fruit.

Kale can be grown in a window box, although dwarf varieties are more suitable for smaller spaces.

Cress makes a useful addition to salads and is very quick to grow, making it suitable for children to plant.Young gardeners can sow the seeds on a piece of cotton wool inside an eggshell - drawing a face on the shell so the leaves become the 'hair'.

Cherry tomatoes are ideal for windowboxes. Plant trailing varieties in a moisture-retentive soil and feed and water regularly.
