Every festival-goer worth her backstage pass has a flower crown these days. But none are quite as impressive as the headpiece sported by Gwyneth Paltrow in the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar.

The actress-turned-lifestyle guru joined Demi Moore and Nicole Richie to pose for a feature about celebrity florist Eric Buterbaugh.

The publication of the story is timely: Mr Buterbaugh is in the midst of his busiest period - awards season.

'Besides the parties, it's all the flowers you have to send people, send to the stars, the thank-you for wearing the dress, the thank-you to the stylist for getting the person to wear the dress,' he tells the magazine. 

'Oscars week, there's blood on the shop floor.'

And a glamorous 'shop floor' it is. The florist operates his business from a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. It's only fitting when one is creating bouquets that cost upwards of $600.

Mr Buterbaugh counts his Bazaar photoshoot co-stars as longtime friends as well as clients. In fact, Ms Moore  - who also posed with a flower crown - calls him her 'best friend.'

Describing their first encounter, at a birthday party in 2002, she recalled: 'In those days I used to carry around with me a small, hard cooler full of Red Bull and I smoked Marlboro Reds.

'So as I was waiting by myself for my car to come, sitting on my little cooler, Eric looked over at me and said, "I like you, because you're just not right." And we've been best friends ever since.'

Mr Buterbaugh, who worked for Gianni Versace before becoming a florist in the late Nineties, is in demand across the globe. He created the flowers for Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle, completed commissions for the King of Thailand and designed the blooms for Salma Hayek's 2009 wedding to François-Henri Pinault at the Venice opera house.

Speaking of the latter, he said: 'It was a three-day affair with the most amazing group of people—Bono even sang.

'The vases were so delicate that they had to be brought to the opera house along with the flowers on these tiny little motorboats that could navigate the canals without the glass breaking.' 

In another recent interview, this time with Vogue.com.au, Mr Buterbaugh says he is lucky that most of his famous clients give him free creative rein. 

'For me, good taste in flowers is a bouquet or arrangement that has beautiful flow and that the flowers have breathing room,' he said. 'A lot of florists just cram, cram, cram flowers in and I want to look at it and cry. It’s like the flowers are choking for air.

'Too many ingredients or colours – for me that’s horrible.'
