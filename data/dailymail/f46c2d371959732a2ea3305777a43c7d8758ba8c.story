 The fate of the UK could lie in the hands of non-Scottish voters.

The referendum on Scottish independence is on a knife-edge – meaning whether the 307-year-old Union breaks apart or stays together may come down to the views of the 500,000 foreigners living north of the border.

Of Scotland’s 5.2million population, an estimated 370,000 English-born people live there who are eligible to vote.

Change: Members of the group 'English Scots for YES' hold a tea-party near Berwick-upon-Tweed on the border between England and Scotland yesterday

A survey in May suggested about 66 per cent intended to vote No on September 18.

Naomi Stewart, 32, a Yes supporter who is originally from Devon but has lived in Scotland for ten years, said: ‘I stay in Lanarkshire now and it’s incredibly deprived. I desperately want life breathed back into it.

‘Scotland deserves to be run by a Government that cares about its people.’

Anya O’Shea, 23, a No campaigner who was born in London but lives in Scotland after going to university in Edinburgh, said: ‘There are uncertainties and the risks.

'I think the expectation that people should take a blind leap into the unknown is totally unfair on working families.

In total, there are about 4million eligible voters in the referendum.

There are also 120,800 other EU citizens – excluding the Welsh and Irish – who can vote, including an estimated 33,000 Poles and 13,400 Germans.

There are an estimated 4,300 French, 3,600 Italians, 3,000 Spaniards, 2,700 Latvians and 2,600 Lithuanians.

Experts believe many of them may choose to back independence because of Westminster’s perceived hostility to Europe.

Bavarian Stefan Buettner, an energy adviser who lives in Edinburgh, said: ‘I feel Scotland is more pro-European than the rest of the UK.

'I want the Yes side to win. The Germans and the Scots are very much compatible and there are a lot of cultural similarities.’

But Ildiko Mair, from Aberdeen, who moved from Hungary 23 years ago, said: ‘The Hungarian community here all want the same – that is to say no thanks.

‘I have no idea why someone wakes up one morning and after 300 years of unity decides to try to fix what is not broken.’
