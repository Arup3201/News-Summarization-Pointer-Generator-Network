She may have once been the Prime Minister of Britain, but when it comes to painting and decorating it seems she wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty.

From ripping out skirting boards to installing ‘modern’ doors, Baroness Thatcher and her husband Sir Denis carried out a number of alterations to their £12million home in the wealthy Chester Square in Belgravia, London.

However, some of the pair’s modifications are to be ‘corrected’ by builders who have been brought in to makeover the Georgian Grade II listed townhouse which was sold to Leconfield Property Group last year.

Workers on site have described the home as ‘unspectacular’ and claim it is not as grand as they believed it to be.

In fact, they will spend the next 18 months renovating the property into a ‘traditional home’ and rid it of previous alterations which are ‘not fitting’ with the original character of the property.

The house was bought by the Thatchers in 1990, shortly after the Baroness left Number 10. It was purchased from the Duke of Westminster, who owns the leasehold, and they spent more than a decade living at the property and carrying out improvements.

It was later sold to a property group based in the British Virgin Islands in 2006, though Baroness Thatcher remained living there until a few months before her death in April last year.

The latest owners now want to reverse some of the changes the Thatchers made to the property, which included lowering the ceilings, adding an ‘unsympathetic' extension, fitting carpet throughout and installing modern doors.

According to planning submissions received by Westminster Council, the plans to renovate the property include efforts to rid it of previous alterations.

The document states: ‘Throughout the property, there is evidence of original features being replaced with cornices, skirtings and other detailing, which are not fitting with the Georgian criterion.’

Because of successive renovations few original features remain apart from the stucco and brick front, according to a Heritage Statement submitted with the planning application.

Prepared by Turley Associates as part of plans approved by Westminster Council, the statement explains the most wide ranging renovations happened after the Thatchers had moved in.

It states: ‘Planning records indicate that a comprehensive refurbishment scheme was undertaken in the early 1990s, including the building of a rear range extending the house up to the mews lane at the rear.

‘As found today, the existing rear closet wing of the house does not retain its original form or appearance.

‘Evidence suggests that this element has been considerably altered during the 20th century. This has resulted in an unbalanced and unsympathetic appearance.

‘There is a traditional style interior scheme throughout, which also appears to be largely modern and of a design rather overly grand for a house of this period and status.’

The document quotes from a pre-application statement prepared by Westminster Council which states: ‘The reinstatement of appropriately detailed skirting and cornicing is welcomed in listed building terms. I would encourage you to remove all modern lowered ceilings as part of your application.’

Builders are set to spend the next 18 months giving the Georgian Grade II listed townhouse a traditional makeover, following its sale to Leconfield Property Group last year

Plans, approved last month by Westminster Council, aim to ‘retain the key historic elements of the internal spaces that remain and/or adapt them sympathetically to the new domestic layout.

‘In addition potential opportunities have been identified to reinstate or enhance features of the former interiors where appropriate, as part of the application scheme.’

Renovations include: installing a porch to match the rest of the terrace, remodelling the rear closet wing to improve its appearance, replacing the modern roof with a mansard one that matches the other terraces, creating a more ‘traditionally designed’ mews building, removing modern partitions between rooms and modern doors and removing elements of the ‘unsympathetic modern interior scheme’.

A lift will also be installed in the rear closet extension and a lower ground floor extension and first floor extension with terrace above will be created under the mews building.

Plans of the proposed development show that on the lower ground floor, a room marked for ‘security’ will be converted into a bedroom with the mews being replaced with a wine store and ‘media room’.

The Thatchers' library on the ground floor will become a ‘snug’ while bedrooms, dressing rooms and en suite bathrooms on upper floors will be altered.

George Brooksbank, one of the 
directors of the Belgravia-based property company, said: ‘We're aiming 
to create a traditional family home, with renovation work that will keep
 and enhance its period features.

‘The renovation work will be extensive, including adding a basement and demolishing and rebuilding the mews.

‘We're bound by strict confidentiality agreements which means we cannot discuss facts and figures, but the house is expected to be completed within 18 months.’

Site manager Bruno, who has been working on the site for a couple of weeks, described the house as ‘unspectacular’.

He said: ‘There's nothing particularly exciting about it, it’s just a house. I've worked on lots of properties in this area and many are much grander than this.

‘When I heard I would be working on it I thought the house would be much grander than it is, which is the surprising thing.

George Brooksbank, one of the directors of the Belgravia-based property company, said: 'We're aiming to create a traditional family home, with renovation work that will keep and enhance its period features'

‘There are white walls throughout and the rooms are 90 per cent carpeted with just a bit of marble in the entrance hall.

‘The most special thing about this house is the person that lived here, not the house itself.’

Mr Brooksbank said he expected the house would be bought by a British family.

He added: ‘It's a very traditional area with many English families, as well as some people from ethnic minorities. It's a popular place to live.’

The developers are awaiting permission to excavate beneath the basement and lower ground floor level, introduce a new staircase and make internal alterations.
