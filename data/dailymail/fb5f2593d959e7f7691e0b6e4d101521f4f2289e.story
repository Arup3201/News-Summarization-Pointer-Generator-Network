Crufts has become embroiled in a second controversy, after two competitors were accused of animal cruelty over the way in which  dogs were handled.

Animal lovers have accused the show's organisers of 'turning a blind eye' after footage emerged showing U.S competitor Rebecca Cross, who won the Best in Show accolade, picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail. 

Following a competition which has already seen more than its fair share of scandal, 160,000 people have now signed online petitions, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title.

 The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S

It comes as the RSPCA announced it would be investigating separate allegations, which involved a dog being beaten by an overseas competitors in the  car park at the Birmingham NEC.

The Kennel Club, the show's organisers, also launched a probe into the allegations, following the circulation of photos online which purported to show the incident.

The two incidents are the latest controversies to hit the world famous competition. Yesterday, it emerged that six dogs who took part in the competition had been reportedly poisoned, including Irish setter Jagger, who died at his Belgium home on Monday.

After the footage emerged of Ms Cross handling her dog, Crufts issued an almost immediate apology.

The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S.

Ms Cross also issued an apology, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit.’

She added: 'It's just one of those things. It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.'  

One of the petitions claims Ms Cross (right), whose prize-giving was interrupted by an anti-Crufts campaigner (left), is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’

Ms Cross (pictured in the arena) apologised, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit'

But the anger continued to grow, with the petitions gaining nearly 160,000 in around 24 hours.

This morning, 105,000 had signed a petition on 38degrees, while 55,000 had supported one on change.org.  

The first petition claims  Ms Cross is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’.

But, in a second statement, the Kennel Club said it would not be 'fair' to strip the dog of its Best in Show title, solely due to the  behaviour of its owner. 

A Kennel Club spokesman added that, although there was 'clear guidance' that dogs should not be handled in this way, it would be reviewing its procedures in light of the incident. 

The RSPCA confirmed it was also investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground, pictured

They said: 'We completely understand the concerns about how Knopa, the Best in Show dog, was handled on the judging table. 

'A decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance. In this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at Crufts and the next steps.  

'The judge’s primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its Best in Show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring.' 

It added: 'Prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward.  

Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium 

The owner of this chamption Myter, Eye to Eye, also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on Friday

Meanwhile, the RSPCA confirmed it was investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground. 

In a statement it said: 'The RSPCA is urging anyone with information about the alleged dog beating to contact us directly, in confidence on 0300 123 8018.  

The Scottish Terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground.

It has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes.

It is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way.

'We received a complaint about this the day after the incident (9 March 2015) and would urge anyone who witnessed the alleged incident to contact us urgently.'

The Kennel Club added: 'The Kennel Club has been made aware of an alleged incident outside the NEC during Crufts, which has led to accusations of cruelty in the way a man was treating his dog.

'We understand that a photograph purporting to show the man in question mistreating the dog, is circulating online and the Kennel Club is looking into this as a matter of priority, as any type of animal cruelty will not be tolerated.

'We will be liaising with the NEC to gather any evidence of what happened and until that time we are not in a position to comment further.'
