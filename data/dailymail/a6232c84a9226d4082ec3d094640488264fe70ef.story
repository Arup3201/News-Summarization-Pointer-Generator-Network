A drug costing up to £9million per patient is to be made available on the NHS - making it the health service's most expensive medicine.

Eculizumab - also known as Soliris - will be offered to about 200 people suffering from a rare kidney condition, the treatments watchdog confirmed last night.

The National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (Nice) said the drug – which will cost the NHS up to £82million a year – would allow patients to live independently for decades.

A Nice spokeswoman confirmed last night that the drug would be the most expensive funded by the NHS.

Sir Andrew Dillon, left, of the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NICE), said he was pleased to have authorised the new 'wonder' drug Soliris, also known as Eculizumab, to treat a rare kidney condition

The drug will treat atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) - a life-threatening disease affecting around hundreds of people in England.

It causes inflammation of blood vessels and the formation of blood clots throughout the body.

There are only around 200 sufferers, with 20 to 30 new patients with the condition diagnosed each year.

Currently there are about 56 patients receiving the drug through a temporary agreement with NHS England. 

Patients are constantly at risk of sudden damage and failure of their vital organs, particularly the kidneys.

Nice said the drug – which will be funded on an interim basis - was a 'significant innovation' and offered 'gains of a magnitude that is rarely seen for any new drug treatment'.

Its chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon conceded the drug would prove to be 'very expensive' and recommended NHS England  find ways of reducing the cost.

The decision to provide Eculizumab, developed and marketed by US firm Alexion Pharmaceuticals, was only approved on the basis of ultra-rare conditions, rather than being assessed on its standard value-for-money formula.

Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) is a life-threatening disease affecting around 200 people in England. It causes severe damage to the kidneys, pictured, leading to kidney failure in some patients 

The health watchdog said that it was unfair to apply the usual rules because it was such a rare condition – meaning drug companies had to recoup their research costs from only a handful of patients. 

With the drug offering an extra 25 years of good-quality life, Nice deemed it worth the annual £340,000 cost per patient to the NHS.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease.

It causes damage to the vital organs, the kidneys, heart and brain in particular.

Although the condition does affect children, around a half of sufferers are adults.

The condition affects the immune system and in sufferers. Scientists believe an abnormality in proteins in the immune system causes cells along blood vessel walls to become damaged.

Platelets become overactive and blood clots form in tiny blood vessels throughout the body.

Clots can block the flow of blood, create inflammation and travel to other organs, causing further damage.

aHUS is caused by changes or mutations in the genes that produce proteins that help control the part of the body's immune system.

The changes cause that part of the immune system to attack the body doing great damage to vital organs if left untreated.

Symptoms of the condition include diarrhoea, nausea and vomitting, shortness of breath, fatigue, heart and kidney abnormalities.

aHUS causes damage to the kidneys, causing many sufferers to require long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant if their kidneys stop working.

Other complications include high blood pressure, around half of patients will experience neurological symptoms, four in 10 will suffer heart problems, while almost a third will have diarrhoea and other digestive problems.

But the decision will come as a blow to cancer patients after a quarter of treatments that can offer a few extra months of life were stopped on cost grounds this month.

Sir Andrew Dillon said: 'aHUS is a very distressing condition that imposes a significant burden both on those with the condition and their carers and families. 

'We are therefore pleased to be able to recommend Eculizumab for funding.

'The Committee accepted that Eculizumab is a step change in the management of aHUS and can be considered a significant innovation for a disease with a high un-met clinical need.'

He added: 'The drug is, however, very expensive. The Committee felt that the budget impact of Eculizumab would be lower if the potential for adjusting the dose of the drug and stopping treatment was explored.

'This is reflected in the guidance which recommends Eculizumab should be funded only if important conditions are met, including the development of rules for starting and stopping treatment for clinical reasons.

'In the meantime NHS England and the company should consider what opportunities might exist to reduce the cost of Eculizumab to the NHS.'

Research has shown that Eculizumab is an effective treatment, which can block the faulty part of the immune system, stopping it causing the cell damage.

Kidney Research UK said the drug has been 'proven to prevent kidney failure' in patients with newly diagnosed aHUS.

'Without it, their kidneys would fail, and as there is no other effective treatment available, patients would have no choice but to start a gruelling dialysis routine to stay alive,' a spokesman said.  

Research funded by the charity at Newcastle University has been central to understanding aHUS and to finding an effective treatment for the disease. 

Elaine Davies, from Kidney Research UK, said: 'We are thrilled with Nice's decision. 

'Although there is a high cost attached to Eculizumab, this treatment is life-changing for aHUS patients and will help improve their quality of life dramatically. 

'We're very proud that some of our research has played a role in understanding the disease.'
