The first man that a cannibalistic Maryland college student tried to kill and eat last spring is now suing the school saying that they had plenty of warnings and should have stopped the murderer before he had the chance to strike.

Alexander Kinyua tried but failed to kill one man, before getting away with it and proceed to kill and eat another.

Now the survivor is suing Morgan State University saying that they knew that Kinyua was a danger to others and they did nothing to stop him.

In the weeks and months leading up to 
the first attack, Kinyua had been caught punching out walls at the ROTC 
office and writing satanic rants on Facebook.

One of his own ROTC instructors even told police after the fact that he was a 'Virginia Tech waiting to happen'.

On May 19, something did happen: he 
attacked Joshua Ceasar who was visiting his friends who were 
then-roommates with Morgan State University.

Mr Ceasar, who is now 23-years-old, was hit in the head with a metal baseball bat, wrapped in barbed wire and chains.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that
Mr Ceaser's friends were able to stop the attack once they heard his 
screams and saw Kinyua dragging him down the hallway while holding a 
knife.

Mr Ceasar was left partially blind 
from the attack, and Kinyua is now in jail after he was eventually 
caught by police after spending days hiding out in the woods. He later 
admitted that he killed and ate a different man.

Now Mr Ceaser is suing the school for 
failing to act in a preventative way, allowing his attack and the other 
attack that left 37-year-old Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie dead.

'By May 2012, it was well-known to the
counselors, ROTC instructors, and Morgan State officials that Mr. 
Kinyua's erratic, aggressive and bizarre behavior was increasingly 
getting out of control, especially his obsession with world cleansing, 
the end of the world, and violence,' Mr Ceaser's attorney Steve 
Silverman wrote in the lawsuit.

Last year, shortly after the attack, 
Mr Ceasar said that he had heard about an outburst Kinyua had in January
at a university forum where he made cryptic comments about 'blood 
sacrifice'.

'If I knew, I wouldn't have been 
anywhere near him or that building,' Ceasar said. His attorney, Steve 
Silverman, is exploring a lawsuit and investigating whether the 
university could have done more.

Two campus officers visited Kinyua after the December outburst and he was assessed by the counseling center, Coleman said.

'If the university had reason to 
believe that any student or non-student represented a danger, of course 
the university would have taken the appropriate steps to remove the 
person from campus or render them harmless,' he said.

In early May, police received a report
that a young man matching Kinyua's description was carrying a machete 
around campus, Coleman said. Officers immediately tracked him to his 
room and searched, but didn't find such a weapon, he said.
