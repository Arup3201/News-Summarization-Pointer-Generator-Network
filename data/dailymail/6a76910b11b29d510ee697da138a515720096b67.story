Professional social networking site LinkedIn will drop its age limit to allow youngsters from the age of 13 to sign up to help them plan where to go to university.

The site will be lowering its age-limit from 18 in a bid to attract young people who are already planning their careers.

While the company has stressed the site will remain 'a professional network', but claims it's new service will offer a service to those planning on applying to college or university.

LinkedIn is hoping to attract teenagers who are already planning their careers when it lowers its age limit from 18 to 13 in the UK

Potential students will be able to 'connect' with Oxford University's Linked In, among others, now that the age limit has dropped

The age limit is expected to be dropped to 13 in the UK and 14 in the US, it has been reported.

According to The Telegraph, the site says it is growing at the rate of two users every second and currently has around £238m members across the globe.

A spokesman told the paper it expected the young teenagers to be 'forward thinkers' who were already thinking about what career path they were going to choose in later life.

Christina Allen announced the launch of the website's University Pages on the company's blog.

She wrote: 'We believe University Pages will be especially valuable for students making their first, big decision about where to attend college. 

Students will be able to find out information from London South Bank University's Linked In page, such as clearing updates and job offers

The company has launched its University Pages which it hopes will help students make 'their first, big decision about where to attend college'

'Therefore, beginning on September 12, 
we will be making LinkedIn available to high school students who can use
LinkedIn to explore schools worldwide, greatly expand their 
understanding of the careers available, and get a head start on building
a network of family and friends to help guide them at every milestone.'

In June it was reported the number of Britons going online had doubled since 2006 and almost half of the 33 million current UK internet users used social networks on a daily basis.

People in the UK were also found to be the second most prolific social network users in Europe - being beaten only by the Netherlands - according to figures from the latest report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Eurostat.

The figures also discovered that although the majority of UK users are aged between 16 and 24 years old, 19 per cent of people aged 65 to 74 used social networks.
