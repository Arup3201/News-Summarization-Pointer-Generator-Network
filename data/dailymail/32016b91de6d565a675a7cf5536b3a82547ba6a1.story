A homeowner has been branded 'Britain's worst gardener' after he filled his garden with so much rubbish it can be seen on Google Earth.

The back garden of David Baxter's home in Uckfield, East Sussex, is in such a state that his local council took him to court because it poses a hazard to environmental health.

The 62-year-old was fined £200 for failing to clean up his back garden after the council prosecuted him under the 'untidy land' law.

'I'm landscaping': What Baxter told neighbours who challenged him over the mess in his back garden

The innocuous front of Baxter's semi-detached home hides a garden filled with rubble, rusting metal and garden waste.

In
 views of his neighbourhood on Google Earth, the overgrown wasteland is a
 stark contrast the the manicured and maintained plots behind houses 
either side.

One neighbour,
 who had challenged Baxter over the state of his garden, said he had 
claimed it was in such a mess because he was in the middle of 
landscaping work.

'It's an 
absolute state - it looks like a bomb has gone off and when the sun's 
shining, it smells like a pigsty,' said the neighbour, who asked not to 
be named.

'I'm so glad I 
don't live directly next door - that garden needs to be sorted out. I 
spoke to him once about it, and he said he was landscaping.

'I don't know what he's landscaping, but he's probably the worst gardener in Britain.'

Shabby: But the front of Baxter's semi hardly suggests the rubbish tip he has accumulated behind

Council and Environmental Services Officers visited Baxter time after time in a bid to try to encourage Baxter to clean his mess, but finally authorities ran out of patience.

Appearing before Hastings Magistrates' Court on June 4, Baxter pleaded guilty to one count of failing to comply with a Section 215 'untidy land' Notice.

Wealden District Council issued the notice after receiving complaints from neighbours.

East Sussex councillor Ann Newton, on the cabinet for Planning and Development, said: 'Mr Baxter, despite being given numerous warnings, ignored Wealden Planning Enforcement Officer's reasonable requests to clear the land which was an eyesore that was upsetting to his neighbours.

'This left us with no choice but to prosecute. This successful prosecution shows Wealden's commitment to ensuring our residents are able to enjoy their surroundings'.

Baxter, who was fined £200 and ordered to pay £270 costs, was given a short deadline to remove all the rubbish and waste from his back garden or face further prosecution.
