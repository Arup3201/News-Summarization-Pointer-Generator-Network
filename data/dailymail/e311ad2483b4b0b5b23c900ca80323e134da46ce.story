Louis van Gaal praised  Wayne Rooney for his performance as a defensive midfielder in the 3-1 win against Burnley, and admitted taking him out of midfield would cause a 'problem'.

The 29-year-old was booked for persistent fouling during Wednesday night's game, but Van Gaal felt the forward demonstrated his remarkable ability to play in virtually any position. 

'I have to look for the better balance and I think until now because of Rooney, we have a better balance in midfield,' the Dutchman told Sky Sports.

'I was very pleased how he replaced Daley Blind in the number six position.

'He showed composure and of course he was also today the Rooney that I want to see, but he has showed that he can play in every position.

'Maybe he can better play in a striker's position but then I have a problem in midfield.'

United supporters may not agree, though, with first-choice forwards Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao again failing to impress. 

The duo only had one shot on target between them during the match, and that was from the penalty spot. 

Rooney, who hasn't scored since Boxing Day, may feel he warrants a place up front as fellow forwards continue to falter.
