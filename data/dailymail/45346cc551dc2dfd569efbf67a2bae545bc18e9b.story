Usain Bolt has made a quick-fire U-turn to support the Commonwealth Games, after coming under fire for claiming they were ‘a bit s***t’.

The Jamaican sprinter appears to have had a change of heart less than 24 hours after he reportedly criticised the Glasgow event, claiming ‘the Olympics were better’.

After watching the Jamaican netball team lose to New Zealand yesterday, the 27-year-old claimed the Games were in fact ‘awesome’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘all lies’.

Support: Usain Bolt (pictured with Prince Harry on Tuesday) appears to have had a change of heart and has now called the Commonwealth Games 'awesome', less than 24 hours after branding them a 'bit s***t'

Not impressed: Usain Bolt has denied reports that he described the Commonwealth Games as 'a bit s***'

Bolt is said to have complained about Glasgow 2014 to The Times as he waited in the rain for a car outside the athletes’ village on Tuesday, just hours after meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

He apparently told a Times reporter that he was ‘not really’ having fun at the Games before branding them a ‘bit s***’.

However, while the six-time Olympic champion yesterday denied making the comments, the paper has stood firmly by its story.

It today published the full transcript between journalist Katie Gibbons and the athlete, with Scottish editor Angus Macleod declaring: ‘We stand by this story 100 per cent.’

Either way, there has already been a backlash – with talk that fans would turn their backs in protest when Bolt competes in the 4x100m relay heats tomorrow. Others hit back on Twitter.

The Times has published the below transcript of reporter Katie Gibbons' interview with Usain Bolt.

KG: Hi Usain, I’m Katie Gibbons, a reporter from The Times.
Nice to meet you

UB: Hi

KG: How are you?

UB: (shrugs)

KG: So are you enjoying the games? Are you having fun?

UB: No

KG: Really, why not?

UB: I’m just not… it’s a bit s*** (shrugs, looks up to grey
sky)

KG: What do you mean?

UB: I’ve only been here two days

KG: Is it like the Olympics?

UB: Nah. Olympics were better

KG: Really, how?

UB: (shrugs)

KG: Where are you off to now?

UB: To do some business

One called him a ‘disgrace’, while 
Paul Hughes tweeted: ‘As someone who plays in a Glasgow pub band, I fear
 @usainbolt may be about to discover what it is like to lose the Glasgow
 audience.’

The alleged
 comments also risk angering Virgin. Bolt made a reported £2million when
 he signed a 2012 sponsorship deal with Virgin Media, which is also 
sponsoring athletics at Glasgow 2014.

But
 the sprinter, who is seeking his first Commonwealth gold, tweeted 
yesterday: ‘I’m waking up to this nonsense... journalist please don’t 
create lies to make headlines.’ His agent also claimed the reports were 
‘utter rubbish’.

However, 
there was no sign of a backlash when, in a carefully stage-managed 
appearance, he turned up to support the Jamaican netball team – with 
crowds of fans clamouring to take a photo as he waved his country’s flag
 from the stands.

The Games has often been dismissed as 
one of the least prestigious athletics championships. Faced with 
potentially disastrous criticism, the Commonwealth Games Federation said
 it was ‘pleased’ with Bolt’s response.

Glasgow 2014 spokesman Jackie Brock-Doyle added: ‘I think he woke up to the story like everyone else. His tweet says it all.’

However, while the world-record holder was quick off the blocks to distance himself from any criticism of the host city, there are hints that his fellow teammates may be feeling less than enamoured with the Glasgow weather... and its food.

There are suggestions that some Jamaican athletes may be struggling to appreciate the Scottish city, where the sunshine of the early days of the Games has been replaced by chill winds and drizzle.

One team official also revealed there had been grumbles about the canteen, saying competitors want ‘more chicken’.

Jamaican team official Rashid Hall admitted: ‘The food is different to the Caribbean.

‘It doesn’t taste like home. We want to see more chicken. We always want to see more food.’

He added: ‘The weather is tough for us.’

In comparison, New Zealand judo star Ryan Dill-Russell said he thought Glasgow 2014 had been ‘amazing’, adding: ‘Who is he [Bolt] anyway?’.
