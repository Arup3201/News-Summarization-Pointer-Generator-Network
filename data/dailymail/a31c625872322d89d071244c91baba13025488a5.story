A young scout has been honoured by Bear Grylls for saving his elderly neighbour's life as she lay helpless for ten hours after a stroke.

Charlie Kemp, seven, alerted his mother Gaynor after noticing that 90-year-old Win Swift had not opened her curtains or collected her milk at the front door after he came back from school.

Mrs Kemp found her neighbour lying at the bottom of her stairs after falling. She had suffered a major stroke.

Mrs Swift spent six weeks in hospital but has recovered enough to return to her home in Maghull, Merseyside.

'Charlie's my little hero and I'm lucky I have such good neighbours,' she said.

Mrs Kemp said her son, who is a Beaver, the section of Scouting for six to eight-year-olds, probably saved the life of their neighbour. 

'When I found Win she was really cold and she says she didn't think she could have lasted much longer,' she said. 'If it wasn't for Charlie, she probably wouldn't have made it.

British adventurer Bear Grylls said he was 'proud' to recognise the young scout's prompt actions

Charlie alerted his mother Gaynor after noticing that their elderly neighbour had not opened her curtains or collected her milk at the front door 

'But he is a little embarrassed by it all. He doesn't realise what a great thing he has done. I'm really proud of him.'

Charlie, who has now won the Chief Scout's Personal Award, said: 'I was really happy be able to help Win and I am glad she is still alive.' 

Chief Scout Grylls said in a letter: 'I am super proud to recognise Charlie's prompt actions which saved this lady's life. This is a brilliant example of how the power of Scouting directly helps other people.'

Charlie's proud mother said: 'When I found Win she was really cold and she says she didn't think she could have lasted much longer.

'If it wasn't for Charlie, she probably wouldn't have made it. But Charlie is a little embarassed by it all.

'He doesn't realise what a great thing he has done. I'm really proud of him.

'Charlie is a really caring boy and he'll go over to Win on his own and spend an hour with her all the time.

'I think it just comes naturally to him.'
