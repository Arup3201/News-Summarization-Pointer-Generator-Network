From the crisp, snow clad mountains to vivid bright blue seas, these breath-taking photographs capture the raw and arresting beauty of the natural landscape.

With subjects ranging from the morning sunrise to the dazzling night sky, the images - all of which were taken in France and Italy - catch these calm and tranquil settings in all their glory.

Taken by photographer Alessio Andreani, 24, they depict different moods for each shot, alternating from the bright and cheerful greenery of Italy to the crashing waves in the south of France.

This picture, showing the Sibillini Mountains in Italy, was taken by photographer Alessio Andreani as part of a series of landscape shots taken throughout France and Italy

The awe-inspiring shots, taken throughout 2012, also manage to display the changing colours of the mountains and lakes, from oranges to yellows and purples to blues.

Mr Andreani, 25, who is from Italy, says he feels a 'strong link with the land where I live'.

He added: 'The sun has a massive impact on how the photographs will turn out; it is like one big flame of light.

'Whilst photographing a lot of these images, I had only a few seconds to get the exact capture I needed, as the sun moves so quickly at sunrise.'

The stunning photographs of greenery were taken in the town of Castelluccio di Norcia and in the hills near Recanati in Italy, showing the landscape off to its best advantage.

Mr Andreani, who was born in Loreto, said: 'Taking these photographs of the vast countryside was very relaxing for me; I was able to just walk and enjoy the moment.'

This picture, which Mr Andreani calls Pink Moonrise, shows the moon coming up behind Mount Redentore in Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, giving the clouds a pink light

In this shot, called Light and Ice, the composition highlights the cold ice in the foreground with the warm, peach-coloured light cast by the sun on Italian mountains

This picture, called Dreaming, captures early morning clouds flowing across rocks in Tellaro, La Spezia, in the Liguria region of Italy

This picture on the left shows a meteor shower in Italy, while the one on the right, taken at Mount Argentella, Italy, contrasts the bright tent with the dazzling night sky

This picture is called Reflections and was taken in the Passetto beach area of the Italian town of Ancona, where the sun peeped through the clouds and lit up the sky

The images of the calm and eerie night sky were also taken in Italy in Mount Argentella and capture the Milky Way above the same town.

Mr Andreani added: 'It was very quiet during the taking of these photographs, and because there was no moon, there were only the stars to light up the sky, making it seem so dark.'

In stark contrast to the pictures taken at night are the shots showing the precise moments of sunrise, which were taken at various places including Monte Conero and Tellaro in Italy, and Cannes in France.

In this photograph, entitled Blowing, a meadow of wild flowers is seeing blowing in the breeze, in contrast to the serene mountains of Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, behind

Here, sunrise in Cannes, in the south of France is the subject for the photograph, which Alessio Adreani has called Red Rocks

In another shot taken in the south of France, this image of sunrise at Cap d'Antibes shows the spume of the sea blurring where the water meets the rocks

They show how the water of the sea and rivers appears to be illuminated in varying shades of blue as the sun rises above.

Meanwhile, the snow and ice demonstrate the contrast between the stone cold land, while the bright sun continues to glow and light up the surrounding mountains.

Mr Andreani said: 'I was really impressed by the colours of the water and the ice in these shots, they changed within seconds and I was lucky enough to experience it right in front of me.'

This beautifully detailed photograph, entitled Tree, was taken in the rolling hills of Castelluccio di Norcia in Mr Andreani's native Italy

This image, taken in Mount Argentella, Italy, and entitled Viewpoint on the Galaxy, is taken at a height of 2,000m and shows light pollution from far away cities

Taken at Dramont on the French Riviera, this image is called The Tower and shows a storm making its way towards the photographer, far beyond a placid rockpool

This photograph, called Climb Over The Mountain, was taken in Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, one hot day last summer

Called Warm, this shot was taken in Ancona, Italy, and shows a warm sunrise lighting up the morning sky over the grey sea

This picture, aptly entitled Blue and Green, was taken in Tellaro, La Spezia, in Italy and shows the dazzling colours provided by the land and the sea

This picture, called Triangle, shows the very last of the day's light touching the peak of Mount Redentore in Italy

The title of this picture, Wind, is explained by the blurred wild grasses in the foreground as they are tossed by the breeze sweeping across Castelluccio di Norcia

This image, Sunrise In The Bay, was taken in Ancona, Italy, and shows water foaming around the reefs and the pink sun touching the cliffs

This shot, entitled Fleeting, shows everyone's dream of an Italian rural landscape and was taken in the hills near Recanati

This image,called Golfo dei Poeti (Gulf Of The Poets), was taken in Lerici, in La Spezia, Italy, and shows waves crashing against the rocks as the sun goes down

This image, called Storm Is Moving, highlights the contrast between the black of the storm clouds and the brilliant bright orange of the sunrise above Portonovo, Italy

The vividness of the colours in the sky and sea make this photograph, entitled Flowing Sunrise, which Mr Andreani took with a seven-minute exposure in Liguria

This image, called Relaxing, was taken in the Gulf of the Poets in Tellaro, La Spezia, Italy, and shows a stunning sunrise coming over the sea
