A cold-hearted crook with a lengthy criminal history sunk to an astounding new low earlier this month when, according to authorities, he stole the wallet of a man who thought he was having a heart attack at a bar in Illinois.

As if that weren't enough, the man then used the money he allegedly stole from the victim to buy the woman the victim had been talking to a drink.

In an alleged crime that a member of the local sheriff's department called one of the 'most pathetic, disheartening things' he's ever seen, when Larry Lotter fell to the ground at the Rock Bottom Bar in Williamson, Illinois, Bryan Kuegler gave the impression that he was trying to help him.

Survivor: Lotter survived, and it turned out he didn't have a heart attack - he now suspects Kuegler put something in his drink that made him ill

However, as surveillance footage would later show, Kuegler was really waiting for the right moment to steal Lotter's wallet.

Thankfully, Lotter survived the frightening ordeal - and his ailment wasn't a heart attack.

'I felt fine, and then all at once, I took a drink of my beer, and I 
felt a real sharp pain, like someone sticking an ice pick in my chest,' Lotter tells KTVI.

Lotter then hit the floor, and his friends called 9-1-1.

As they were waiting for the ambulance to arrive, Kuegler can be seen on surveillance video leaning over Lotter as others are trying to keep him conscious.

History: Kuegler, 32, has a lengthy criminal history for crimes like narcotics possession, theft and domestic violence

'As the EMT’s were getting ready to come in, is when he reached down and grabbed my wallet and stuck it in his pants,' Lotter told the station.

Madison County Sheriff's Department Captain Mike Dixon said Kuegler can then be seen walking off with the wallet.

'Then as the victim left the establishment, [Kuegler] went into the restroom, returned, and threw the victim’s wallet on the floor,' Dixon says.

Dixon says Kuegler took two $50 bills out of Lotter's wallet.

According to Mike Lovsey, the owner of the bar, Kuegler then spent Lotter's money to buy drinks.

'He tried to buy the girl that Larry was with that day a drink with the money he took,' Lovsey says.

Because of the surveillance footage, Lotter easily identified Kuegler as the alleged thief. In fact, he had recently put brakes on Kuegler's car about a month ago.

'Real shocked,' Lotter says of learning Kuegler allegedly stole from him. 'The night I went home, I could hardly sleep because it bothered me so bad.'

Lovsey was equally stunned.

'He was trying to play Good Samaritan, then turned around and ripped the 
guy off at the same time,' he says. 'I was shocked. I couldn’t believe someone 
would do something like that.'

According to Lotter, doctors told him a heart attack was not what caused him to collapse at the bar that day, and he suspects Kuegler could have slipped something in his drink to knock him out. 

'Rarely have I seen somebody literally steal from what they believe to be a dying man. It’s pretty pathetic,' Dixon says.

Kuegler was booked into the Madison County Jail on one count of felony theft from a person. He faces up to five years in prison if he's convicted.

Kuegler's previous offenses include theft, domestic battery and narcotics.
