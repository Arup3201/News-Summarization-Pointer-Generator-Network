Chelsea skipper John Terry is chasing success on all fronts this season - insisting the current crop of Stamford Bridge stars need to win silverware to be considered greats.

Jose Mourinho takes his Blues to Anfield on Tuesday night for the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final clash having witnessed a fine performance and 5-0 win at Swansea on Saturday.

That result, coupled with reigning champions Manchester City losing to Arsenal, leaves Chelsea five points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League table.

They also face an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Bradford City at the weekend, with their Champions League round of 16 clash with Paris St Germain also on the horizon.

And Terry wants the club to fight for every title available as the class of 2014/15 looks to add their names to the Chelsea history books.

'We've got top, top players but, as I've said before, until we go and win things, it's not there yet,' the former England captain said.

'That will be the test. We've shown during the first half of the season that we're capable of pushing the top sides and that's what we aim to do.

'There is a motivation in the dressing room to win the league and push on in the Capital One Cup, Champions League and FA Cup. At this stage, to still be involved in all competitions is where you want to be, and it's down to big players to step up.'

The win at the Liberty Stadium was Terry's 649th appearance for Chelsea and takes him clear of Frank Lampard into third place on the all-time list for the Blues. 

The 34-year-old is hoping for a similar evening when he leads the side out at Liverpool on Tuesday but expects a stern test. 

'In the first half at Swansea, the football and the goals were some of the best I've seen. Myself and Gaz (Gary Cahill) felt like we weren't doing much apart from applauding what we were seeing in front of us, it was a delight to watch and I really hope we continue that.

'It (Anfield) is going to be a tough place to go. I think Daniel Sturridge might be back, (Raheem) Sterling is back as well and they proved when we went up there in the league that it's always a tough game.

'You kind of forget form and where they are, it goes out of the window, it's Chelsea v Liverpool. It's going to be tough and over the two legs I just hope we're strong enough.'

Goals from Cahill and Diego Costa cancelled out Emre Can's opener as Chelsea left Anfield with all three points on November 8, but Liverpool have only lost twice since then and Brendan Rodgers' side will be hopeful of extending that run at Terry's expense.
