Probe: Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, is driven to his apartment in London. His company is facing calls for an investigation into claims it hacked into the phones of 9/11 victims

The FBI is investigating allegations that media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp sought to hack into the phones of September 11 victims, a law enforcement official said today.

The official revealed the news to the Associated Press on Thursday, while New York City-based News Corporation is in crisis mode.

A rival newspaper reported last week that the company's News of the World had hacked into the phone of U.K. teenage murder victim Milly Dowler, 13, in 2002 and may have impeded a police investigation into her disappearance.

More possible victims soon emerged - other child murder victims, 2005 London bombing victims, the families of dead soldiers and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

The FBI's New York office didn't immediately comment on Thursday and neither did News Corp or the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.

On Thursday, Mr Murdoch caved in to pressure from Britain's Parliament as he and his son James first refused, then agreed, to appear next week before lawmakers investigating phone hacking and bribery by employees of their newspaper empire.

Mr Murdoch began his media career in Australia in 1952 after inheriting The News newspaper after the death of his father, and he has built News Corp into one of the world's biggest media groups.

Its assets include Fox News, the 20th Century Fox movie studio, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and three newspapers in Britain - down from four with the death of the News of the World.

Demands: Senator John Rockefeller has called for a probe into whether journalists working for Rupert Murdoch's empire targeted U.S. citizens and, right, Senator Frank Lautenberg called on the FBI to investigate whether News Corp had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The news of the FBI's investigation 
comes after U.S. media watchdogs were calling for the agency to 
investigate claims that News Corp hacked into the phones of victims of 
the 9/11 attacks.

Research group Media Matters was 
calling on the American public to lobby Congress to hold hearings 'to 
see just how far this scandal goes'.

Senator
 John Rockefeller wants a probe into whether any journalists working for
 the Murdoch empire had targeted U.S. citizens after the terror attacks 
in New York and Washington in September 2001.

The Democratic senator, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, did not offer any evidence that victims had been targeted.

Major player: Mr Murdoch's empire includes Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post in its portfolio

But
 in a statement, he said: 'I encourage the appropriate authorities to 
investigate to ensure that Americans have not had their privacy 
violated.

'The reported 
hacking by News Corporation newspapers against a range of individuals - 
including children - is offensive and a serious breach of journalistic 
ethics.

'This raises serious questions about whether the company has broken U.S. law.'

A
 second senator - Frank Lautenberg - urged authorities to examine 
whether or not News Corp had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
 which makes it illegal for a U.S. company to pay foreign officials to 
obtain or retain business.

In
 a letter to regulators, he wrote: 'Further investigation may reveal 
that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at News 
Corporation.'

Matt
 Butler, chief executive of Media Matters, said: 'American also need to 
know whether our privacy was violated by Murdoch reporters searching for
 a good scoop to sell news.

Breach of ethics: A private investigator in New York has alleged he was contacted by News of the World reporters wanting 9/11 victims' phone numbers and details of calls made around the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon

'We can't rely on News Corp, with is 
record of mismanagement, to address the problem. We must take proactive 
steps to protect our privacy from News Corp's mismanagement.

'Murdoch's cover-up is falling apart, with serious consequences for hacking victims and News Corp shareholders alike.'

Another
 pressure group, Protect our Elections, has written to the FBI demanding
 parallel civil and criminal investigations into News Corp in the wake 
of the News of the World hacking scandal.

Earlier
 this week a former New York policeman now working as a private 
investigator alleged he was contacted by News of the World journalists 
wanting  9/11 victims' phone numbers and details of the calls they had 
made and received in the days leading up to the attack.

Empire: Mr Murdoch's media business also includes The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph in Australia

A source said: 'This investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data.

'He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives.

'His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voicemails, just like it has been shown they have done in the UK.

'The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look.

'The investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks.'

Members
 of the family which used to control the Wall Street Journal have said 
they would not have voted to sell the newspaper to Rupert Murdoch if 
they had realised the full extent of News International's phone-hacking 
scandal.

Murdoch bought the
 newspaper in August 2007, six months after the News of the World's 
royal editor, Clive Goodman, was jailed for voicemail hacking - but at 
the time News International said the practice was confined only to 
Goodman.

Today Christopher 
Bancroft, part of the family that used to control Dow Jones and Company,
 the Journal's publishers, said: 'If I had known what I know now, I 
would have pushed harder against [the bid].'

Mr
 Bancroft, who at the time had sole voting control over a trust which 
represented 13 per cent of Dow Jones shares, said he would have 'held 
out' if he'd known.

Another
 relative, Lisa Steele, said 'it would have been harder, if not 
impossible' to have accepted the bid if she had known the full extent of
 the scandal.

She told 
ProPublica: 'The ethics are clear to me - what's been revealed, from 
what I've read in the Journal, is terrible. It may even be criminal.'

Some members of the Bancroft family say they would have voted the same way even if they knew about the scandal.

Bill
 Cox III said he 'probably would have thought twice about it but 
probably would have sold', although he said the scandal made him 'sick 
to my stomach'.

Even at
 the time of the sale, the deal with News International proved 
contentious, and the family recruited an independent panel to keep an 
eye on the newspaper's ethics.

The boss of News Corp's Australian division – which owns eight of the 12 major papers down under -  announced it was investigating all payments it has made for stories over the last three years as the hacking scandal spread.

John Hartigan, in an email to staff, said it was 'offensive' to link them to the NoW scandal and said there was 'absolutely no reason to believe' they were involved in any wrongdoing.

But he added: 'We will be conducting a thorough review of all editorial expenditure over the past three years to confirm that payments to contributors and other third parties were for legitimate services.'

Hugh Grant took his campaign against Mr Murdoch's newspaper empire to the States.

The actor appeared on America's most watched breakfast TV program, The Today Show, warning viewers the scandal could well spread there.

'I would've thought it would be of interest to American's because Rupert Murdoch does own an enormous amount of your media, with Fox news and stations, and 20th Century Fox, and some of your newspapers, he told viewers.

Scandal: The News Corporation HQ is in New York. Pressure groups are calling for civil and criminal investigations into the media group

'I think people need to ask themselves, "Who is this man who owns such a large part of our media?"

'And when you hear some of the new allegations that may include hacking of some of the 9/11 victims, that may strike a chord with Americans.'

It comes as Mr Murdoch's grand plan for a further expansion of his media empire was in tatters last night as the 'firestorm’ over phone hacking forced him to withdraw his bid to take over BSkyB.

The tycoon shelved his £10billion offer for the satellite broadcaster as it became clear that British Prime Minister David Cameron, along with party leaders Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, were joining forces in a Commons vote urging him to back off.

Mr Cameron also relented in the face of intense pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats and agreed to a judicial inquiry into press standards, regulation and ownership, and allegations of illegal phone hacking by the News of the World and police corruption.

Media proprietors, including Mr Murdoch, as well as senior politicians, police chiefs and journalists accused of phone hacking, are all expected to be summoned under oath.

The probe will be headed by Lord Justice Leveson, who prosecuted Britain’s worst female serial killer, Rose West.

The News of the World published its last edition on Sunday.
