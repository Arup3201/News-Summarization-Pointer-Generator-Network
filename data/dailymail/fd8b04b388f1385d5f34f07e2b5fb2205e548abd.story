Fashion trends come and go, and there are several that we’re thankful do indeed go.

But one of these, a wardrobe staple of the 1970s, is apparently making a comeback:  the dungaree.

A revival led by celebrities including Alexa Chung and Kerry Katona has led to a surge in sales of the bib-and-brace overall, which was last popular in the early 1990s.

Celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Heidi Klum have been spotted wearing dungarees leading to a sales surge of the garment in High Street stores

Selena Gomaz strolled to a Los Angeles studio last Friday in a pair of baggy dungarees that also boasted some definite side skin action

Online fashion retailer ASOS.com said dungarees – updated for the 21st century – are proving a hit this season.

Head of womenswear Rachel Morgans 
said: ‘All dungarees are performing well, from soft, tailored, jersey 
styles through to casual denims. Luxury fabrics and adaptations in shape
 have made them a fashion statement.’.

Designer Stella McCartney has created
 a flared set and a shorts set for this season, both of which are said 
to be almost sold out.

Teen stars are also embracing the trend with singer Pixie Lott and Disney star, and Justin Beiber's on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez both wearing denim dungarees recently.

Miss Chung, who has been spotted in 
short and long dungarees, said recently: ‘You should have fun with 
fashion. I like to wear dungarees.’

Pixie Lott paired her roll-up dungarees  with stylish red leather brogues and square handbag when she saw Rihanna at her gig in Kentish town during her 777 tour

But, as with the recent onesie craze,
 not everyone is a fan. Mail columnist Amanda Platell said dungarees are
 ‘the most hideous fashion item short of culottes ever to walk the 
streets’

Once
 predominantly worn as a practical item of clothing for mechanics, 
farmers and construction workers, who appreciated the loose fit and deep
 pockets, the dungaree made a brief comeback in the early 1990s when 
they were worn by Jennifer Aniston and Kylie Minogue.

The word ‘dungaree’ comes from the name for a coarse cloth made in the remote Indian village of Dongri.

DOs

- Try shorts for summer worn with a Breton top and espadrilles for classic beach styling.

- OR, add a tailored blazer for a look that will work at night, too.

- Whether you’re wearing dungarees or their more feminine cousin, the pinafore, update the look with a smart heel.

- You can’t go wrong with a classic, full-length style. Everyone from Alexa Chung to Alessandra Ambrosio is wearing them long. Add a ¾ sleeve top, cuff the hems and wear with statement heels for a more modern style.

DON’Ts

- Avoid wearing long dungarees with lace-up boots; you’ll end up looking more 90s than now.

- Denim is clearly the way to go here. Velvet and loose fabrics can wind up looking like a sack.

- Stay away from belting short or long denim. It looks a bit frumpy.
