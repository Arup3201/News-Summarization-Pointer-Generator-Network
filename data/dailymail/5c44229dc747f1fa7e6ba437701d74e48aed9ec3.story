Two female Italian councillors have embarked on an unusual quest to clamp down on illegal prostitution - by dressing up in miniskirts and confronting kerb-crawlers with a hidden camera.

The stunt had been initiated by Mayor Dimitri Russo, who would stay in the background  while the two fake prostitutes waited by the road, and approach the men when they stopped. 

Mr Russo and councillors Anastasia Petrella and Stefania Sangermano staged the set-up after growing tired of the damaging effect prostitution had on their town near Naples in Campania.

In the little town of Castel Volturno, as in the rest of Italy, prostitution is illegal.

It is a small community on the Campanian coast with a population of around 23,000, and Mr Russo has made is his mission to 'clean the streets'.  

Mr Russo said the 'fake prostitute' campaign was initiated to hammer home this message to the local male population.

The stunt saw Ms Petrella and Ms Sangermano dress in miniskirts with revealing tops and high heels, and stand by a busy road popular with local prostitutes.

But when punters would stop for the fake prostitutes, they were confronted by the mayor and a cameraman, leaping out from behind parked cars.

Mr Russo said he wanted to  engage the kerb-crawlers in dialogue over what they were doing.

He said: 'I had leaflets just warning them of their civic responsibilities and exactly why prostitution is illegal, but I have to admit I didn't give many out. 

'When they saw me coming with the TV cameras, most people drove off at high speed.'

The footage of the stunt has been handed over to local police in Castel Volturno, who prosecuted the men caught on camera.

In all cases, the men readily paid the fine rather than risk the embarrassment of going to court.

Mr Russo said he wanted to send out a reminder to Italians who use the services of prostitutes, as well as the prostitutes themselves, that they will face legal consequences.
