A former Scotland Yard commander decorated by the Queen has condemned the ‘jobsworths’ who stopped him volunteering to man the phones in a tiny village police station.

Bob Marsh, 74, who during his distinguished police career was in charge of protecting Royalty as head of the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Department, said he only wanted to help out his local community support officer in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

But despite obtaining support for his application from a former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, he was turned down by Sussex Police.

Decorated: Bob Marsh and wife Sandy on the day she was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order

Mr Marsh was told that he and his wife, a former Royal press secretary who also applied for an unpaid role, failed the vetting process because they had lived abroad for a while before moving back to Britain.

‘It’s a jobsworth thing,’ Mr Marsh told The Mail on Sunday. ‘We’ve given a lifetime of service to Queen and country and I think it’s sad that they have these silly rules.

‘All we wanted to do was answer the phones and deal with the public over the counter, which would have given the community officer more time to patrol the streets.’

Before being responsible for the Royal Family’s security, Mr Marsh headed Brixton Police during the 1981 riots and played a key role in the Met’s response to the Iranian Embassy siege a year earlier.

When he retired in 1997 after a career spanning 40 years, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Yet all this, plus a glowing reference from George Churchill-Coleman, who ran the Yard’s anti-terrorist branch in the 1990s, could not sway the human resources department at Sussex Police.

Mr Marsh’s wife is Sandy Henney, 61, a former press secretary to the Prince of Wales, for which she was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order. She also worked for the Metropolitan Police for 14 years as a senior press officer and was vetted to work at Downing Street, the Ministry of Defence and the Crown Prosecution Service.

But like her husband, her application for the job in Billingshurst  was rejected.

Having joined the Met as a 16-year-old cadet, Mr Marsh spent the last seven years of his career running the elite squad charged with providing 24-hour security for the Royals and London’s diplomatic community. His work also saw him honoured with the Queen’s Police Medal.

Sussex Police claim they are only following the agreed vetting procedures

‘All this counted for nothing because we failed the vetting at the first hurdle,’ said Mr Marsh. ‘We moved back to Britain last year  having spent nine years in Spain.

‘We may not have been resident in the UK, but having lived in another EU country with reciprocal arrangements it would have been quite easy to check that we hadn’t attended any insurgent training camps in the mountains of Malaga.’

The couple were at a festival near Billingshurst last November when they were handed a leaflet asking for volunteers to help the local police community support officer (PCSO) run his office.

‘The idea was to get volunteers in to release him to patrol the streets,’ said Ms Henney.

‘We thought we’d be useful because of our backgrounds and it was a good way for us to get to know the community. We rang the PCSO and he asked us to come in for a chat.’

While PCSO Adrian Bell was delighted at the prospect of having such an illustrious duo joining his village crime-fighting team, he warned them they faced bureaucratic complications. However, the couple assumed they would not be insurmountable and posted their application forms to Sussex Police.

‘We then got another load of forms back from the human resources department,’ said Ms Henney.

‘They wanted to know everything about our relatives, whether they had even the most minor of convictions.

‘They also wanted to know if there was anyone else living in our house. There was a diversity form, all sorts of things. I turned to my husband and said, “I’m losing the will to live here, Bob.” ’

The application was supported by a reference from George Churchill-Coleman, former head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit

Mr Marsh added: ‘There were nine pages of it. I filled in fewer when I was vetted by the Security Services for my work with the Royals.

‘Seriously, I was positively vetted to a level I would have thought warranted being able to answer a phone or deal with a member of the public visiting a police office.’ His wife continued: ‘George Churchill-Coleman had already agreed to be a referee for both of us. And our second referee was someone who actually worked for Sussex Police.

‘But having received George’s reference, Sussex said that because the second person hadn’t seen us for a year we would need another one.

‘At this stage, we thought why should we put another friend through the bother if there was a strong chance we wouldn’t get through anyway?

‘So I said to human resources that I understood the residency demand would prevent us getting through and they said that was absolutely right. Why they sent more forms back and asked for another referee is beyond me.

‘The point for me is this is putting process before people. Why didn’t they apply common sense?

‘And what value is the EU if a police force in the UK can’t pick up a phone to the Guardia Civil in Spain to ask if we’ve been behaving ourselves for the past three years?’

Sussex Police said: ‘Although we don’t comment on individual cases, we do follow the Association of Chief Police Officers’ national  vetting policy guidelines for all forces, which set out a minimum residency period in the UK of three years immediately prior to any application for employment with the force.

‘However, any applicants who  are told that they have been rejected on those grounds can always seek  a review, which will be individually considered.’
