You've probably seen the hands of Ashly Covington countless times before, and assumed they belonged to the likes of Adriana Lima, Brooke Shields or Charlize Theron, for example.

In fact, Miss Covington is the woman crouching just under the camera frame in a contorted position, her perfectly manicured hands spread across the model's face, or lurking suggestively onto her bottom lip.

'I’ve had to stick my fingers in model's mouths for countless beauty product shots,' Miss Covington, 37, tells MailOnline. 'Sometimes it's creepy, sometimes it's hilarious.'

Hands off! Ashly Covington (left) is a professional hand model who has built a lucrative 14-year career by leasing out her perfect mitts for TV and print commercials

Blink and you'll miss it, but Miss Covington's hands have replaced those of Ms Lima in Maybelline commercials, Ms Theron on a Dior J'adore fragrance spot, and Brooke Shields for Colgate.

Not to mention the pages of every magazine you've ever heard of, and for brands including Clinique, Canon, Gillette, Sephora and Rolex.

Miss Covington has built a lucrative 14-year full-time career out of leasing her hands. Based in Old Church, Virginia, but with accommodation in Los Angeles and New York, she has at times flown cross-country several times in one week, and has an agent in almost every major city on the East Coast.

Wound up: No two job is ever the same, and Miss Covington has had to make friends with hundreds of unusual co-stars over the years - this snake for example (pictured)

Keeping her hands in tip-top condition, ready to rush to a last-minute job at any hour of the day, is no mean feat.

'I'm always almost wearing gloves and I have to adopt certain habits for everything I do,' she says. 'How I open a car door, how I pick up a box, even where my hands swing when I'm walking down the street.

'I've had accidents with all three of those types of situations that have lost me work in the past!'

Miss Covington's hands were first discovered while she working as a waitress, soon after she finished college in Virginia, where she had studied theater.

'An agent flipped over them,' she recalls. 'She insisted I stop biting my nails and then took me for my very first manicure.'

Soon, she was building a strong portfolio of 'hand jobs' as she fondly refers to them, and before she knew it, it was her full-time profession.

'I'm lucky,' she says. 'Hand modeling has afforded me the time to explore my love of photography.

'My dad gave me my first camera when I was five, and I used to dress up my long-suffering cats and photograph them in amusing poses.

'How I - or the cats - didn't destroy my hands is a mystery.'

Clench: 'It’s very important that I can hold [props] without shaking or showing signs of strain,' she says. 'My wrists must be veinless!'

Surprisingly, Miss Covington has a cat even now. 'I never thought I could risk it but Lily was a street rescue. She promised she wouldn't hurt my hands and she never has.'

The jobs Miss Covington gets booked for vary in scope enormously; from two-hour shoots to 18-hour marathons with huge pythons wrapped around her arms, or caressing the torsos of male models.

One of her more memorable encounters with a man was a job she shot with comedian Andy Sandberg.

'I had my arm slithering up his tuxedo shirt sleeve and my hand on his face,' she recalls.

'It seems like an easy job. Until you try it.'

Precious: Miss Covington has to consider every move she makes. 'How I open a car door, how I pick up a box, even where my hands swing when I'm walking down the street,' she says

Fell into it: Miss Covington's hands were first discovered while she working as a waitress, by an agent who snapped her up, and sparked her long and successful career

Miss Covington spent many of her earlier years sitting in front of a mirror and practicing positions. 

'You have to have steady hands, and you have to be able to repeat small motions over and over with perfect precision.'

Take a pizza commercial for example. A crew will spend hours painstakingly choreographing what will turn out to be a three-second shot.

'So in I come, the rest of my body at a bizarre angle so it's hidden out of the way, and then I wait for the crew to call action,' she explains.

'Then I smoothly pick up the slice of pizza - again and again - until that cheese stretch is the best cheese stretch in the history of cheese stretches.'

Patience: 'You have to have steady hands, and you have to be able to repeat small motions over and over with perfect precision,' Miss Covington explains

Dedication: She spent many of her earlier years sitting in front of a mirror and practicing positions

How it's done: 'Extra virgin olive oil is my not-so-secret weapon,' she says. 'I carry it with me and slather it on under my gloves wherever I go'

Miss Covington suspects a lot of her success is down to her patience, practice and the speed with which she can get the shot perfect.

'One job I did for Miller Lite required me to push six beer bottles across the table and have them spin so the label stopped in front of the camera,' she says.

'My body was out of the shot and the set-up meant I couldn't even see my hands. But I practiced it enough times before the shoot that, incredibly, I nailed it on the first take.'

In addition to leading most of her life wearing gloves and avoiding - at all costs - breaking a nail, moisturizing is key in keeping Miss Covington's hands camera-ready.

'Extra virgin olive oil is my not-so-secret weapon. I carry it with me and slather it on under my gloves wherever I go,' she reveals.

'That, and a soap line I discovered called Pure Harmony. It's the best soap I have ever found for nourishing my skin and keeping it squeaky clean.'

Finally, she works out and keeps her arms fit.

'It’s very important so that I can hold products with my arm outstretched - think Warrior Pose for hours on end - without shaking or showing signs of strain,' she says.

'My wrists must be veinless!'

She may have fallen into this unusual career by chance, but did Miss Covington always know she had nice hands, even growing up?

'Not at all,' she remarks. 'I do remember my grandmother's hands though. 

'She had beautiful long fingers and her nails were always perfectly polished with a dark red.

'After I was booked on my first job, I called my mom to tell her and she laughed. 

'Turns out my grandmother was a hand model for typewriters in the 1930's.

'I'm a legacy hand model and just never knew it.'
