The wife of an ousted Chinese politician will go on trial next week for the murder of a British businessman.

Gu Kailai, the wife of former Communist Party Politburo member Bo Xilai, is accused of poisoning Neil Heywood with cyanide after he allegedly threatened her son in a row over money.

A family aide - Zhang Xiaojun - has also been charged. If Gu, 53, is found guilty of the murder she could face the death penalty.

Scene: Neil Heywood was killed at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November

Two anonymous lawyers close to the 
case have told the Associated Press that the trial will start next 
Thursday in Hefei city in east China.

Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in a 
hotel room in China last November. At first officials blamed the expat’s
death on excess alcohol, and his body was cremated without a post- 
mortem examination.

But in February Mr Bo’s former police 
chief, Wang Lijun, told officials he believed the consultant was the 
victim of poisoning, allegedly on the orders of Mrs Gu.

Mr Heywood mentored the Chinese power 
couple’s son, Bo Guagua, to secure a place at Harrow, the leading public
school in North-West London.

Mr Heywood went on to work as a ‘fixer’ for Mr Bo, the Communist Party leader in the eastern city of Chongqing.

Reports have claimed Mr Heywood helped
Mrs Gu to smuggle money out of China, and that she allegedly funnelled 
up to £3.8billion to accounts in the names of relatives and friends 
overseas.

Commentators in China have questioned 
whether she used some of the money to pay her playboy son’s fees at 
Harrow, and subsequently at Oxford and Harvard universities.

Mrs Gu, a former lawyer, faces a legal
system in which police, prosecutors and judges are all controlled by 
the Communist Party. The country has a conviction rate of around 98 per 
cent.

Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with 
his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a 
meeting last November and was found dead a day later.

State media said Mrs Gu and her son 
had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu 
was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’.

If convicted, Mrs Gu and her alleged 
accomplice may face death by lethal injection although the death penalty
is sometimes commuted to a life sentence in high-profile cases.

The murder case is at the center of a 
political scandal that has highlighted factions in the Chinese 
leadership ahead of the power handover to a younger generation of 
leaders.

Bo, 62, was once considered a strong contender for a seat on the all-powerful, nine-member Politburo Standing Committee.

Bo was sacked from his position in 
March. He is under party investigation for unspecified discipline 
violations. No formal charges have been brought against Bo.

Political observers have said a 
failure to forge a unified stance on handling the divisive Bo case could
affect the Communist Party's focus on working out leadership changes 
that will be decided at the 18th national congress later this year.
