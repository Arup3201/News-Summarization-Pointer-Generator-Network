A British scientist suffered serious hand and face injuries when a Taliban booby-trap bomb exploded inside a top-security laboratory in Afghanistan.

Military police are investigating why the device wasn’t detected by stringent security checks it should have gone through before it was given to the expert to examine.

The scientist, having been assured the device was safe, was not wearing protective equipment. But it blew up in his hand.

SERIOUS ERROR: A Taliban booby-trap bomb went off at Kandahar airfield, above, causing the British scientist who was handling it to suffer serious hand and face injuries

The incident happened at Kandahar airfield last December but has only just been confirmed by the Ministry of Defence.

The Mail on Sunday understands that the device, which may have been hidden inside a mobile phone case, was picked up by a British soldier after a battle in southern Afghanistan. It should have been thoroughly tested and given the all-clear before being passed to the scientist, who was responsible for gathering forensic evidence.

The MoS further understands that, had it not detonated in the lab, the device may have been put on a plane back to UK – for further testing here. A mid-air explosion aboard a military aircraft could have killed many British personnel.

The scientist lost several fingers in the blast and his face was severely burned. He was the only casualty and received emergency first aid at the scene before being driven to a military hospital. He has since returned to Britain and is receiving further treatment for his injuries.

The scientist has also been questioned as part of the Royal Military Police (RMP) investigation into the incident but he is not believed to be in any way responsible for the blast.

CONFLICT: The explosive device was found after British troops clashed with the Taliban 

Because the inquiry is being carried out by the RMP, its conclusions will not be made public. But last night the Shadow Defence Secretary demanded that Parliament be given a full explanation.

Vernon Coaker MP said: ‘There is no civilian scrutiny of these procedures and therefore the Ministry of Defence must work doubly hard to ensure public confidence. The Government should also explain why this incident was not made public before now, as the details will cause shock and concern.

‘This incident resulted in tragic circumstances for the scientist involved but, had this device been in transit to the UK, the situation could have been much worse.’

The scientist was working for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), an agency of the MoD which is responsible for providing scientific research to support military operations. His injuries are understood to have prevented him from returning to work and, following the RMP probe, he is expected to be offered a financial settlement by the MoD. The DSTL provided scientific advisers to work alongside British forces throughout the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan where they advised commanders on the technology used by the enemy to make roadside bombs.

The incident is believed to be the only example of a Taliban booby-trapped device detonating inside a British base.

DSTL confirmed the incident. A spokesman said: ‘We recognise the invaluable contribution of all our people and are committed to supporting anyone injured through their employment with us. An investigation into this incident continues.’

Had the bomb not gone off it could have placed on a plane back to the UK
