An alleged white supremacist is accused of torturing and sexually assaulting his two teenage stepdaughters over five years because he didn't like that they were Latina.

Justin Ladd, 33, faces 21 criminal counts after the girls told police that he slammed their feet with hammers until they were flattened, pulled on their tongues with pliers, beat them with belts and straps and exposed himself to them.

The girls, now 14 and 16, said Ladd abused them between September 2008 and February 2013 in their Massachusetts home, and warned a motorcycle gang would rape and kill them if they told their mother.

The teens described being called racial slurs by Ladd, who has the words 'white power' tattooed across his stomach. The older girl told police she felt Ladd never liked her or her sister because they were part Latina, Eagle Tribune reported.

Arrested: Justin Ladd, 33, is accused of torturing and sexually assaulting his two teenage stepdaughters over five years

According to the police report, the girls said Ladd demanded they exercise to exhaustion and he would strike them with a hammer if they stopped. He also allegedly made them dance like monkeys.

'While imitating monkeys ... Justin would state, ‘If you’re not white, you’re not right',' the report states, according to Boston Herald.

The
 girls also said they saw Ladd use heroin and cheat on their mother, 
held one stepdaughter's head underwater when he didn't like the taste of
 her cooking, touched the girls' nipples and exposed himself to them, saying, 'This is what your mom takes every night'.

The girls' plight first came to light in August last year after a friend of their mother witnessed an alleged attack and called police, WMUR.com reported.

Christina Fintonis said Ladd, his wife, and their five children lived with her for a week in the summer of 2013.

'All of the sudden, he yells up for the oldest daughter - she's 15 now - to come upstairs to do something for him, and all of the sudden the house shook, and we heard a big bang and were like, 'What was that?'' Fintonis said.

'She came down bawling her eyes out, and she said, 'He grabbed my face and slammed me into a wall'.

Fintonis called police, and Ladd was arrested. Police Chief Chris Warn told WMUR.com that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the children were removed from Ladd.

It is not clear if the girls were then returned to their stepdad's custody.

Boston Herald reported that, while welfare officials were notified about the alleged ongoing abuse, it wasn't until recently that Ladd was charged.

'The North Andover Police Department has been called to the residence, and within the last two years, we contacted DCF twice regarding allegations of potential abuse,' police Lt. Charles Gray told Boston Herald.

DCF has not commented.

Eagle Tribune reported the girls made the allegations to a social worker on April 14 and were interviewed by police on April 23.

Ladd faces court on May 6, charged with
 21 criminal counts including indecent assault and battery on a child 
under age 14, open and gross lewdness, assault and battery, assault and 
battery with a dangerous weapon, and intimidation of a witness.

The girls are in the custody of the state Department of Children and Families, according to court papers.
