Pope Francis today delighted a huge crowd of more than 150,000 people with his first speech from his studio window on St Peter's Square, telling them that he hoped they would 'have a good lunch'.

The crowd packed the famous square at noon, when the window was opened for the first time since Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI gave his final window blessing last month.

Breaking with tradition, Francis delivered off-the-cuff remarks about God's power to forgive, instead of reading from a written speech, and the crowd roared in delight.

He also spoke only in Italian - 
beginning with ‘buon giorno’ (Good day) and ending with 'buon pranzo’ 
(have a good lunch) - instead of speaking in several languages as his 
last few predecessors did.

His comments and humour delighted the
 crowd, drawing cheers and laughter, and it was clear that in just five 
days, his straightforward, spontaneous style has become immediate 
hallmark of his papacy.

Francis
 began his first Sunday as pontiff by making an impromptu appearance to 
the public from a side gate of the Vatican, startling onlookers and 
prompting cheers.

Dressed in white cassock, the 
76-year-old, then kept up his simple, spontaneous style by delivering a 
brief, off-the-cuff homily at the Vatican's tiny parish church.

Francis waved to the crowd outside St
 Anna's Gate and before entering the church, which serves Vatican City 
State's hundreds of residents, he shook hands of parishioners and kissed
 babies.

In keeping with his informal style, he
 then went over to the chief of his security detail and appeared to 
indicate he wanted to greet two priests in the crowd, who approached and
 embraced him.

The impromptu appearance came more 
than two hours ahead of his first appointment of his papacy with the 
faithful from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square.

After the Mass, he stepped out 
jauntily from St. Anna's Church and waved to a crowd of hundreds kept 
behind barriers across the street, and then greeted the Vatican 
parishioners one by one.

One young man patted the pope on the 
back in an indication of the informality that from the first moment of 
his papacy has been evident.

‘Francesco, Francesco,’ children 
shouted his name in Italian from the street. As he patted one little boy
 on the head, he asked ‘Are you a good boy?’ and the child nodded. ‘Are 
you sure?’ he said.

In his homily, Francis spoke only five minutes, saying the core message is ‘that of mercy.’

He said God has an unfathomable 
capacity to pardon, and noted that people are often harder on each other
 than God is towards sinners.

Four days after Benedict’s last 
blessing on February 24, he went into retirement, the first pontiff to 
do so in 600 years. Francis, the first Latin American pope, was elected 
on March 13.
