A late-term abortionist left court in chains on Monday after being  found guilty of murder.

Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, who ran the now-shuttered Women's Medical Society Clinic in Philadelphia, had been charged with four counts of capital murder in the deaths of babies whose spinal cords he was accused of snipping to bring about their deaths.

He was found not-guilty on one charge, but each of the first-degree capital murder charges could earn him the death penalty.

The disgraced doctor was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 
Karnamaya Mongar, 41, a refugee who died after a drug overdose following an abortion in November 2010.

Facing the death penalty: The late-term abortionist shook his head as the guilty verdict came in at the Philadelphia court

Reports noted that Gosnell shook his head in disbelief as the verdict was read on Monday afternoon.

He
was also found guilty of conspiracy to perform abortions past 
Pennsylvania's 24-week legal threshold.

The jury also found him guilty 
on most of the more than 200 counts of violating the state's 'informed 
consent' law, which says there must be a 24-hour waiting period before 
an abortion.

They found he was guilty of murder in the deaths of babies, who had been named A, C and D for the purpose of the trial.

In
earlier testimony, the court heard how a clinic employee had 
photographed Baby A after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk
you to the bus stop.'

Lock down: It took a jury in Pennsylvania just ten days to find the killer doctor guilty 

Clinic
workers also testified that they had seen Baby C, a little girl, move 
her arm before her neck was snipped, bringing about her death.

And
Baby D was born in the clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get
out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine.

He was found not guilty in the death of Baby E, who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped.

Dr Gosnell's attorney Jack McMahon said they were 'disappointed' with the verdict.

Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, has been convicted of murdering three babies at his clinic. He was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a patient

Defense: Gosnell's lawyer Jack McMahon speaks following the verdict, which he called 'disappointing'

Tragic: He was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, who died after an abortion

'We put on a vigorous defense,' he told CNN. 'We think it went well in the courtroom... but we respect the jury's verdict.

'Obviously the jury took their job very seriously... By the nature of the verdict - both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the evidence. They were conscientious.'

He added that it was too early to say if he would appeal, and would not comment on whether he thought his client would get the death penalty or whether he would be speaking during the penalty phase, which begins on Tuesday next week.

'House of horrors' doctor Kermit Gosnell built up a multimillion dollar property empire from the pain and suffering he inflicted carrying out thousands of illegal abortions.

With annual earnings of more than $1.8m according to prosecutors, the 72-year-old 'baby killer' invested his money in a series of properties that included an ocean front home and 18ft sailing boat.

MailOnline has discovered Gosnell, who faces the death penalty after being found guilty in three out of four murder charges today after cutting the spinal cords of babies during late term abortions, owned at least nine properties in four states.

They included a $900,000 townhouse in Philadelphia, a $800,000 home overlooking the ocean in New Jersey and several condos.

Investigators are looking to see if he owns further properties, including any abroad, after he refused to respond to a court order telling him to reveal all his assets.

The IRS is interested in the rogue doctor after prosecutors said Gosnell was mostly paid in cash. When his home was raided they found $240,000 in bundles.

Gosnell's assets are estimated to be worth several million dollars and all paid for from the 15 abortions a day he carried out for the past 30 years.

The verdict was reached just hours after
the seven-woman, five-man jury - which had been deliberating for 10 
days - sent out a handwritten note to say it was hung on two counts.

But after the jury delivered their note, the judge told them they had to agree on the verdict and were sent back to deliberate.

The jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on April 30.

As prosecutors gave their closing 
arguments in Gosnell's trial two weeks ago, Assistant District Attorney
Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked 'Are you human?' - but the 
doctor simply laughed.

'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said.

He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients.

The defense questioned testimony from
staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe, claiming 
that the babies had died from abortion-inducing drugs rather than 
severed spines.

After weeks of hearing from former employees, Gosnell did not testify, and his lawyer, John McMahon, called no witnesses in his defense.

He said that the doctor had simply provided
desperate, often poor woman with a solution, and he branded 
prosecutors 'racist' for attacking Gosnell, who is 
black and whose patients were largely minorities.

McMahon argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath.

'These
are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one
piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was 
born alive.'

Nowhere to turn: Davida Clarke said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger

But the prosecutor questioned why 
else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born 
alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery 
easier, he said.

Gosnell's grisly business was 
discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate 
prescription drug trafficking at Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area 
of West Philadelphia.

Instead, they came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report.

The
tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout 
Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, 
even cat-food containers.

The report added that dozens of women were injured at 
Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of 
horrors'.

Some
left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted 
through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal 
remains still inside them, the report alleged.

Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet

No escape: Mongar allegedly died after staff had been unable to open this side door for an hour

Employees
at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their 
mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be 
removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.'

Former
staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and 
painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were 
then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended.

Gosnell
has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest.

The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions.

Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.

Eight other defendants 
have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing. They include Gosnell's wife, Pearl, a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions.
