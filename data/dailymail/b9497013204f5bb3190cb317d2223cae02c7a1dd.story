Shooter Adam Lanza carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School

Adam Lanza had always been a child in need of help.

At age 3, he was referred to special education after he began to exhibit oddly repetitive behaviors and couldn't socialize like most kids.

By fourth grade, he had been diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and autism.

Yet year after year — as psychiatrists insisted that Lanza should be on treatment and strict medication — his mother Nancy refused to follow through on the requests.

She chalked up her son's behavior to a presumed superior intelligence, seeing him as a gifted student, despite testing done by experts showing he presented average intelligence.

But, as the years went on, the truth became clearer: Adam Lanza was a deeply troubled young man who obsessed over mass killings as he fell deeper into a pit of mental illness while his mother ignored his struggles

These are the findings of a new report by the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut, which released on Friday a 114-page dossier about the life of the shooter who massacred 20 children and six adult staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown on December 14, 2012.

The report charges that the local school system enabled Nancy Lanza as she accommodated and appeased her son — even as he became more withdrawn socially and exhibited frightening signs of his obsession with murder.

The Office of the Child Advocate says there were missed opportunities to provide more treatment for Lanza.

'Both AL's mother and his educational team shared a goal of managing and accommodating, rather than securing treatment for, AL's disabilities, and likely this approach was fueled by a lack of critical information and guidance,' the report says.

The report adds: 'There were early indications of AL’s preoccupation with violence, depicted by extremely graphic writings that appeared to have been largely unaddressed by schools and possibly by parents.'

By eighth grade, Lanza's anxiety became so severe, he was placed in a program for children who are 'too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school.'

A major red flag came when Lanza was 14: the Yale Child Study Center, where he underwent a psychological evaluation, said that a 'strategy of accommodating AL, rather than addressing his underlying needs, would lead to a deteriorating life of dysfunction and isolation.'

The Yale center prescribed extensive treatment and ongoing expert consultation for Lanza — all recommendations that were ignored.

Lanza himself refused to follow treatment for his anxiety and OCD, disagreeing with doctors over his Asperger's diagnosis and avoiding individual therapy.

His mother Nancy enabled him and kept him out of treatment, the report says. 

'Though AL was profoundly impaired by anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, his parents may not have understood the depth or implications of his disabilities, including his need for ongoing support,' the report says. 

Lanza completely stopped seeking psychiatric help after 2006.

Twisted mind: Adam Lanza spent most of his time in an online community dedicated to talking about mass murders, as seen in this email he sent days before opening fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School

In the three months before the December 2012 massacre, Lanza had not left his room in his mother's spacious colonial-style house, where he lived surrounded by an arsenal of weapons and spent long hours playing violent video games.

His parents were divorced, and Lanza had not seen his father for two years. The report said Lanza's severe and deteriorating mental health problems, combined with a preoccupation with violence and access to deadly weapons, proved a recipe for mass murder.

Lanza lived in 'virtual social isolation,' spending his days obsessing over mass killings and exchanging emails with a cyber community of murder enthusiasts.

Although he struggled with depression and at times had suicidal thoughts, there is no evidence showing that he was psychotic throughout the period.

Despite his declining mental state, Lanza's mother — with whom he'd went on a series of shooting activities over years — didn't seem to curtail his access to the high-capacity magazine weapons guns Nancy Lanza had in her home.

In his last few months, Lanza spent most of his time inside his home, refusing to leave.

Lanza barely ate anything and was anorexic when he died at just 112 pounds on his 6-foot frame.

The report also provocatively asks whether a family that was not white or as affluent as the Lanzas would have been given the same leeway to manage treatment for their troubled child.

'Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?' the report said.

Lanza killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, then shot his way into the Newtown school on Dec. 14, 2012, and gunned down 20 children and six educators before committing suicide.

The advocate's office investigates all child deaths in the state for lessons on prevention. The authors of the Newtown report said it aims to reinforce the importance of effective mental health treatment and communication among professionals charged with the care for children. 

'Records indicate that the school system cared about AL's success but also unwittingly enabled Mrs. Lanza's preference to accommodate and appease AL through the educational plan's lack of attention to social-emotional support, failure to provide related services, and agreement to AL's plan of independent study and early graduation at age 17,' the authors wrote.

The authors said they could not say whether more effective treatment could have prevented the tragedy.

'This report raises, but cannot definitively answer, the question as to whether better access to effective mental health and educational services would have prevented the tragic events at Sandy Hook,' they wrote.

The police investigation into the massacre concluded more than a year ago with prosecutors saying that a motive might never be known. It said Lanza was afflicted with mental health problems, but despite his dark interests, he did not display aggressive or threatening tendencies.

Documents released by police in December 2013 included descriptions of sporadic treatment for his mental health troubles. At one point, experts at the Yale Child Studies Center prescribed antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication, but Nancy Lanza discontinued the treatment and never scheduled follow-up visits, police reports said. 

A Connecticut judge last year ordered Newtown school officials to give Lanza's records the Office of Child Advocate for its investigation. The governor's Sandy Hook Advisory Commission has been waiting for the office's report before releasing its recommendations on what the state can do to prevent and respond to future mass killings.

Child Advocate Sarah H. Eagan already has met with the families of the victims and Newtown school officials to discuss the findings.
