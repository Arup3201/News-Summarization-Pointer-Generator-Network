A mosquito's antenna, a falling sycamore seed - and incredible internal shots of the human body: these images show the wonders of science from around the world and beyond.

Selected for the Royal Photographic Society’s latest exhibition, they highlight the beauty of scientific research.

Among the pictures on display at the International Images for Science Exhibition 2013 - which showcases the work of 54 scientists - are dividing cancer cells, a bat embryo, gallstones, the cell wall of a coffee bean and, from slightly further afield, the Orion Nebula.

Incredible views of the human body are now possible through sophisticated scientific instruments such as fibre optics, endoscopes, microscopes, telescopes, stereo microscopes and ophthalmoscopes

The show features works by 54 scientists from around the world

Here, thermal imaging has been used on a subject to dazzling effect

Selected for the society's latest exhibition, which is touring the UK and rest of Europe, the images highlight the incredible beauty of scientific research

Photography skills play a crucial 
role in medicine, forensic science, engineering, archaeology, 
oceanography, natural history and many more areas.

Dr
 Michael Pritchard, director general of the Royal Photographic Society, 
said: 'The society was founded in 1853 to promote the art and science of
 photography and we’ve been doing just that ever since.

‘We held the first International Images for Science exhibition in 2011 and it went down extremely well.'

The application of photography to science is almost as old as photography itself.

This remarkable image shows the interior cell walls of a coffee bean

A close-up of gallstones, caused when cholesterol level in our bile is too high, and excess cholesterol is turned into stones

This captivating image of the Orion nebula reveals an area of our galaxy as a bustling neighbourhood of recently formed stars, hot gas and dark dust. The nebula is visible to the unaided eye as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion

Beauveria bassiana, 2012, by Nicole Ottawa, Reitlingen, Germany. This, believe it or not, is the base of a mosquito's antenna. The image is from a scanning electron micrograph, and has been digitally coloured

As early as 1872, Eadweard Muybridge, a British-born photographer, used photography to study and analyse motion in horses.

Since then, by using invisible radiation, new techniques and methods of photography have arisen.

This
 has happened, for example, through sophisticated scientific instruments
 such as fibre optics, endoscopes, microscopes, telescopes, stereo 
microscopes and ophthalmoscopes.

‘Gone are the days when we were restricted to 1000 ISO emulsion sensitivity,’ said Dr Afzal Ansary, exhibition co-ordinator.

Among the startling images on show is this mouse foetus

Extreme close-up view of the head of a Yellow Paper wasp by Daniel Kariko. Many species build their nests on human habitation, while not normally aggressive paper wasps will defend their nests vigorously. This image is part of a series investigating our often-overlooked housemates

Triple exposure image showing a seed falling from a Sycamore tree by Adrian Davies, Surrey. This image was created in three exposures; the first with flash to show the leaves and seeds, the next a half-second exposure showing the spiralling fall and the last a flash exposure to freeze the seed at the bottom of its descent

‘Today,
 DSLR cameras with full frame sensors have the ability to process images
 that reduce noise in low light conditions.

'We have CCD sensors, 
sensitive to much higher ISO sensitivities which can yield usable 
images.

‘We
 used to say that, “if you can see it, it can be photographed” and now 
we say, “even if you cannot see it, we most likely can photograph it”.’

The International Images for Science exhibition is currently on a tour of the UK before heading to Europe.

Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins on an ice floe near Danko Island in the Antarctic by David Doubilet. The photographer observed them pushing each other off the floe and swimming in the water as if playing a game of tag

Weevil found on front porch doormat by Daniel Kariko. There are over 40,000 species of true weevils in the family Circulionidae, beetle-like creatures typified by a long snout and clubbed antennae

The left image shows the collision of two water droplets beneath a bursting soap bubble by Greg Parker, Hampshire. The image was captured using a Canon 5D Mark II SLR camera and a xenon flash unit with an exposure time of 9 microseconds. The right image unique fishbone pattern is created by two colliding steams of liquids by Ted Kinsman.  The pattern is currently the focus of scientists studying the strange world of fluid dynamics

Human cortical neurons with interconnecting dendrites, 4,200X by David Scharf. Cortical Neurons make up the brain's cortex which in part makes up the cerebral cortex, responsible for memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness

3D reconstruction of a glass model of a jellyfish, imaged using X-rays in a micro-CT scanner by Dan Sykes, Natural History Museum. The artificial colours used here are based on the density of the glass. This incredible model was sculpted in glass in the mid-19th Century by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka. The techniques used by this father and son team are not fully understood, it is hoped that this study will help reveal some of their secrets

A porcelain crab feeding inside the safety of its host Pocillopora coral branches by Louise Murray from London. It is lit by the bright green fluorescence of the coral. These are normally very shy creatures and are difficult to photograph

Light micrograph of a mouse embryo, approximately 10.5 days post-fertilisation by Jim Swoger. The specimen was stained with a fluorescent marker that highlights the presence of precursor cells to nerve tissue then chemically treated to make it optically transparent
