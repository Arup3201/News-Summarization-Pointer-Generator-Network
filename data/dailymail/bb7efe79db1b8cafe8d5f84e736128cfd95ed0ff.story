A Utah judge has ruled that a man accused of killing his four-year-old stepson can stand trial for murder charges.

Prosecutors, who claim Nathan Sloop and his wife starved and abused the boy for several days until his death in May 2010, plan to seek the death penalty.

Four-year-old Ethan Stacy's body was found, with his face disfigured from hammer blows, in mountains. The makeshift grave had been sprinkled with dog food.

In court: Nathan Sloop listens as a judge rules that there is enough evidence for him to stand trial for aggravated murder

Sloop, 34, was ordered on Thursday to stand trial for aggravated murder, child abuse, obstruction of justice and desecration of a body.

After a preliminary hearing in March, Judge Glen Dawson was asked by the prosecution consider the constitutionality of 'Shelby’s Law,' a 2007 amendment to Utah’s homicide statute that allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The law allows the sentence to be handed down in cases where a child dies as a result of abuse. The prosecutors would not have to prove the killing was intentional, only that it was a 'reckless indifference to human life'.

Sloop's defense lawyers are trying to 
challenge the law under which the prosecution is seeking the death 
penalty, according to the Huffington Post.

They argued that the hearing in March was only preliminary and that their full case had not yet been heard.

However, the judge said it was too early to hear constitutional arguments about the death penalty.

Sloop, from Farmington, Utah, who is due back in court on August 13, pleaded guilty to charges last year, but later invoked his right for a judge to hear testimony and evidence to determine whether there was probable cause for a trial.

His wife, Stephanie, who is also accused of contributing to her son's death, is awaiting trial.

Ethan had traveled from his home in Virginia, where he lived with his father, Joe Stacy, to stay with his mother as part of a custody agreement.

During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, a medical examiner testified that Ethan died from a combination of too many over-the-counter medications, pneumonia and severe burns, likely caused from hot water in a tub.

A burn specialist testified that the injuries would have left the boy dehydrated and nauseous and caused his skin to blister and fall off.

The burns would have required skin grafts and weeks of hospital treatment. Dr Jeffrey Saffle said.

The child's face was beaten beyond recognition 
with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him. 
He had allegedly also been starved and bruised.

At a hearing in March defense attorneys said that though the parents did not seek the right 
medical treatment, they did try to get help for the boy.

The evidence showed the Sloops had 
asked their chiropractor how to treat Ethan’s second-and third-degree 
burns, along with how to handle Ethan’s behavioral issues, according to 
the Salt Lake Tribune.

The chiropractor, who never examined 
Ethan, told them to put honey on the wounds and give the boy oregano oil
to control the behavioral issues.

Defense attorney Richard Mauro said:
'They thought that Ethan was sick. They believed that he was ill and 
they thought he had an allergy. They were giving him over-the-counter 
medications and they ended up harming him more than they were helping 
him.'

The court also heard about 
the amount of prescription medication that Sloop was taking in 
the months before Ethan died, during the preliminary hearings.

According to a Department of Professional Licensing document, which 
tracked all of the narcotics that the 34-year-old was prescribed, he was 
given 4,146 pills in an 11-month period including Lortab, Valium, Percocet, an antihistamine and anxiety medication.

At the hearing in March the court heard disturbing video recordings, phone calls and horrific messages about how the Sloops would allegedly treat Ethan and how they would have to 'break his ego'.

In addition to capital murder, the 
defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally 
inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported.

Prosecutor David 
Cole told the March hearing that Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed.

The defense argued the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration.

The court heard tapes where Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water.

The court also heard a jail-house 
phone call at the hearing in March to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his 
relationship with the child's mother 'like a battleship'.

He
also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from 
his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator.

In a 
short video that was shown during the March hearing, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled 
with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun 
with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.'

In
an audio recording also played in court, Sloop can be heard 
asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return 
to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his 
father was mean or hurt him.

'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked.

Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.'

Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the boy beaten and locked up at home when they married in May 2010

Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries.

Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News.

When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth.

She told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so.

On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, the couple reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton.

However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County.
