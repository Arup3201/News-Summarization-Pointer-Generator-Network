Real Madrid were shocking in pink in San Sebastian on Sunday night as they were beaten 4-2 by Real Sociedad.

Just 100 days after their Champions League triumph, the balance of the team that won the club its 10th European Cup looks to have been seriously upset by the sale of Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso.

Supporters will now be asking why they have signed Manchester United substitute Javier Hernandez and not the Monaco striker Radamel Falcao they were craving.

Karim Benzema, who many supporters wanted replaced by the Colombian, was poor in this embarrassing defeat but he was not alone as Madrid looked shaky at the back, slow in midfield, and uninspired in attack.

Goalkeeper Iker Casillas said: 'After 15 minutes we thought the victory was ours but in the end it was a horrible performance from us and we have to learn from this. 

'We have a very important badge on our shirts and we have to honour that. We have all been guilty tonight. It was not just the defensive performance the whole team has to be held responsible.'

Before the nightmare last hour of the game, Ancelotti's side dominated. 

It took them just six minutes to take the lead with Toni Kroos's perfect corner planted on to the head of Sergio Ramos, who thundered it past Enaut Zubikarai.

Ramos nearly doubled his tally, and Real Madrid's lead, on nine minutes when he hit the cross-bar with a free-kick from the edge of the area. 

It was a let-off for the home side but there was no respite as Bale made it two from Modric's pass. The quick nutmeg of hapless Sociedad defender Gorka Elustondo was magical and the quick left-footed finish lethal. 

Real Sociedad were all at sea and they should have been lost without trace before half-time but Real let them back into the game with some woeful finishing and some terrible defending.

Benzema might have headed in a third when an awful back pass from David Zurutuzu put the Frenchman through on the keeper but as the two challenged for the ball Zubiakarai did enough to prevent the striker making contact.

Isco then got to the byline and dragged the centre back to Marcelo whose first time shot was palmed away by Zubikarai. Ramos then headed over from a corner with what could have been goal number five in the first 25 minutes. 

Strike: Gareth Bale puts Real Madrid 2-0 up in the 11th minute after a cheeky nutmeg and tidy finish with the left boot into the far-right corner of the goal

Better times: Bale and Co thought they were cruising in Sociedad - and they were - until the home side took control towards the end of the opening half

Who needs Ronaldo? Cristiano was missed in the end by the Madrid club as they fell to their first defeat of the La Liga season after winning their first last week

Former QPR midfielder Granero finally gave Real Sociedad's supporters something do other than whistle their own side when his vicious shot was blocked acrobatically by Ramos on the edge of the six-yard box. 

Carvajal then jumped clumsily into Zurutuzu and the referee could easily have pointed to the spot. It was the start of a poor period of play from Real Madrid's right-back and it was the key to Real Sociedad's revival. 

He was beaten by Xabi Prieto in the air with the midfielder flicking on a corner that reached Inigo Martinez at the back post. The defender swept in unmarked and with Ramos spectating he pulled a goal back.

Carvajal was again at fault when incredibly the home side were back on level terms. He failed to get close enough to Alberto De la Bella and the left back had time and space to send over the perfect cross for Zurutuzu to head home.

Thanks: Inigo Martinez (pictured) brought Sociedad back into the game at 2-1 with his simple tap-in at the back post after a flick at the front from Xabi Prieto

Hard to take: Sergio Ramos on his knees during the 4-2 defeat as Real struggled to take charge over Sociedad in the second half after a more promising first 45 minutes

Real could have been behind as early as minute three of the second half but Imanol Agirretxe headed well wide from close range with only Casillas to beat.

Real Madrid were desperately missing the running of Di Maria and the oragnisation of Xabi Alonso with their midfield too easily bypassed by Real Sociedad's. Defender Pepe was seen screaming at the quartet of Isco Kroos, new £75million man James Rodriguez and Modric to play closer to the back four but the warnings were not heeded and soon Real Sociedad had the lead.

On 66 minutes it was a former Real player who helped inflict the killer blow. Sergio Canales had come on as a sub along with former Arsenal stirker Carlos Vela. He turned away from Ramos and crossed to the edge of the six-yard box. Zurutuzu got to the ball first ahead of Carvajal to smash it high into Casillas' net.

With 15 minutes left Vela controlled the ball with his arm inside the penalty area and when the whistle did not go, he gleefully rifled the ball past Casillas to make it 4-2.

Ancelotti reacted by taking off Carvajal and brining on Arbeloa – hardly the sort of change that was going to get Real back into the game but with Ronaldo injured the visitiors had no forwards on the bench.

Manchester United striker Hernandez is being brought in for exactly that reason. Impact from the bench will be his job description, on Sunday night in San Sebastian that was needed more than ever.

The game had started as a must-win match for Real Sociedad manager Jagoba Arrasate it ended with the dark clouds of doubt gathering of Ancelotti who must sort the mess out quickly before the Madrid derby and the start of the Champions League after the international break.

Celebration: Sociedad emerged 4-2 victors over Real Madrid on their home turf but were not expected to do so with the likes of Rodriguez, Bale and Co still on show
