Serenity for sale: Bloxworth House, which was used as one of the main locatins in 1967 film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel Far From The Madding Crowd, has gone on the market for £4million

Grand: The property was bought by Henry Trenchard in 1689 and remained in the family until the 1960s

In the Oscar-nominated movie, the property, built in 1608, was the fictional home of heroine Bathsheba Everdene, played by Christie.

After inheriting the house, the headstrong character hires shepherd Gabriel Oak, played by Alan Bates, who then falls in love with her.

Bathsheba is also pursued by farmer William Boldwood and handsome cavalry officer Frank Troy but goes on to marry Oak.

In real life, the house, near Wareham, was bought by Henry Trenchard in 1689 and remained in the family until the 1960s.

It was purchased in 1997 by garden landscape designer Martin Lane Fox, the uncle of dotcom millionaire Martha Lane Fox, who renovated the gardens and installed a stunning ornamental canal.

The property also benefits from huge bay windows that overlook the impressive grounds, which also house a three-bedroom cottage, two-storey dovecote and a tennis court.

Mr Lane Fox has now put the historic property up for sale as he plans to downsize.

Bizarelly, the family of the estate agent selling the house also used to own it.

Peter Lane, of estate agents Savills, even recalled being at the property as a child when the filming took place in 1967.

Grade I-listed Bloxworth House was built by George Savage in 1608 and is believed to be the earliest use of brick in Dorset.

It is constructed of brick elevations with limestone dressings under a tiled and stone slate roof. 

The
architects created a stunning visual effect by using a combination of 
red and dark purplish bricks with random patterning in some areas.

Many of the windows are stone mullioned with leaded lights.

One
of the three bays on the North elevation was extended during the 18th 
Century and, inside, the house features a grand 17th century fireplace. 

In
recent years, the property's current owner, the award-winning landscape
designer Martin Lane Fox, improved the already picturesque grounds by 
renovating the gardens and installing a stunning ornamental canal.

He said: 'The property was bought by Henry Trenchard in 1689.

'It
was owned by descendants of the Trenchards which then became the 
Pickard-Cambridge family, until my great-grandmother married a Lane in 
the late 1800s.

'They moved into the property and were there for about 50 years until my father’s first cousin bought it in 1964.

'I
remember going to the house as a child of about six or seven with my 
sister when they were filming Far From The Madding Crowd.

'They had put fake walls around the gardens and the house which were hollow, so my sister and I would crawl inside them.

'It left the family for a number of years and was purchased in 1997 by Martin Lane Fox, a renowned landscape gardener.

'When he bought it there was just grass, lawns, and paddocks, so he was virtually able to start from scratch on the gardens.

'He
put in place the ornamental canal at the front of the house as before 
it was all lawn, and it now has a long driveway and electric gates.

'The house itself is stunning but the gardens make it, and there are quite a lot of other beautiful, historic buildings.

'This house would be a lovely home 
for a family and in fact I have been speaking to man who viewed it and 
said it would be like a "Christopher Robin" childhood for his son.'
