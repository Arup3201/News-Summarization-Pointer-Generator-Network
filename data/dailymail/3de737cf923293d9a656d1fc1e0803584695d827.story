Most people see chores as a complete bore but some savvy entrepreneurs have turned signing up for all kinds of odd jobs into a thriving six-figure business.

The latest trend to come from the wonderful world of the internet is people advertising a task that they either don't know how to do, don't have the time to complete or simply would prefer to outsource.

Some keen taskers have found the odd jobs business so lucrative that that they thrown in their careers to concentrate on completing chores for other people as a full time occupation.

People post a job on the website Airtasker with the price attached that they are willing to pay - and then a secret bidding war decides which person gets the gig.

Daily Mail Australia looks at some of the more peculiar chores that people have taken on to make some big bucks:

Daniela White has been earning up to $1,500 a week from odd jobs advertised on the website Airtasker. Her husband, Phil, is quitting his job as a caravan builder so they can start earning at least double that amount

Daniela White has been earning up to $1,500 a week since August and is on such a winner that her husband, Phil, is quitting his job as a caravan builder so they can start earning at least double that amount.

'I get so many requests that I don't get enough time in the day to do all of them,' she said.'I've had to knock some back because I haven't had time to put in an offer.' 

The 37-year-old Melbourne resident has done it all from charging $100 to sew scout badges on five blankets for a family and reviewing a phone app for a restaurant.

But the most surreal job Daniela has signed up for is pretending to be a man's partner for a timeshare holiday presentation for an hour and a half.

'He didn't want his partner to know because it was a surprise for her but he needed to have a partner to get the freebie holiday voucher,' she said. 'We had a blast and I made $50.'

Rod Armstrong has been a handy man at a Bondage parlour which filled with whip, chains and harnesses

A former software engineer, Rod Armstrong, 60, took on ageism and won by doing chores for others and is now earning a tidy sum.

'Nobody gives a technical job to anyone over 30 anymore, so when I got sick of being rejected I tried Airtasker,' he said.

'My first job was moving two chairs 3km from one house to another for $75. It was such easy money and I was hooked.'

The Sydneysider has been paid for all sorts of odd jobs including installing an iPod connection to a 1933 valve radio and fixing furniture in a bondage and discipline house.

'I didn't know what the business but I was taken into a dark room and asked to wait for the lady who was with a client,' he said. 

'I had to wait for 15 minutes and I figured out pretty quickly that I was in a dungeon because there were whips, chains, harnesses, masks, feathers and red velvet on the walls.'

He has been back to the business several times to do a variety of tasks including painting walls, plumbing jobs and refitting doors. 

Assembling furniture for people is a chore that Rod has taken on regularly.

'It doesn't surprise me that people want to pay for their furniture to be put together because it requires patience,' he said. 'It's easy to screw things up.' 

It's not uncommon for Rod to turn up to a job and have to disassemble the piece and literally start from scratch. 

'A man once tried to put together a Dyson vacuum cleaner and when I turned up he gave me a bucket with all of the parts - people just give up.' 

Rod has fixed at least a dozen doors across Sydney which have been knocked down - much to his amazement.

'Some people say they had to get in because they had a child locked in the bathroom and others have been drunk when they got home at night and can't get in,' he said.

'I always evaluate whether it's worth the money, taking into account petrol prices and travel time, but I've managed to make a decent living for a while now.'

Dee has been paid to pick up and deliver a parrot and also buying a crocodile bathmat from IKEA

Dee Papworth was stressed out working in income protection and decided to take a break for a couple of months ago to work out whether to return her job or have a complete career change.

The 40-year-old started to do a few odd jobs a couple of months ago and is now earning a minimum of $1,000 week. 

She said she could be earning a lot more but was restricted by sharing a car with her partner and also holding down a part-time job.

But the Melburnian said she is planning to resolve these roadblocks and will then be well on her way to earning at least double what she makes now with the six-figure mark becoming a highly achievable target.

'One of the most unusual jobs I have had is picking up a parrot that a uni student had bought and looked after it for six hours before dropping it off to him,' she said. 

'It was quite funny because it would start squawking really loudly every time I walked into the room.' 

'I also had to pick up a crocodile bath mat from IKEA for a man's child.'
