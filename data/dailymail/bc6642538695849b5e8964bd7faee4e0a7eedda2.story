Sick internet 'trolls' have posted abusive messages about tragic PC David Rathband on a Facebook tribute page set up in Raoul Moat's memory.

PC Rathband, who was found hanged at his home this week, was shot in the face and blinded by gunman crazed killer Moat in Newcastle, who was on the run after shooting dead his former girlfriend's new partner Chris Brown, 27 in July 2010.

However this week, as PC Rathband's family and 
friends struggled to come to terms with his death, 'fans' of Moat took 
to Facebook to criticise the hero PC.

Last night, a spokesman for PC Rathband's charity The Blue Light Foundation, set up to help members of the emergency services injured in the line of duty, called for the page to be shut down.

Meanwhile film director Michael Winner, whose charity the Police Memorial Trust is planning a tribute to PC Rathband, branded the trolls 'idiots', the Sunday Mirror said.

Stuart Dube posted on the wall of the R.I.P. Raoul Moat! group: 'David faces more rawth (sic) of the big man upstairs for shunning a second chance which Raul didnt have so sod him for the decision he has taken on his life. blame his employers the gvt and his family cause these are the people who let him down big time!'

The group has been 'liked' by almost 30,000 people.

Tom Day posted the sick joke: 'Bet david dint see that comeing', while Neil Freshwater said: 'we love ya moaty you did what you did because you was pushed to do it, now that w***** is dead you can RIP'

Another fan of Moat ranted: 'One less pig to worry about.'

PC Rathband revealed shortly before killing himself that he could no longer remember the faces of his wife and children - but could recall the image of gunman Moat.

In November last year he announced he and his wife Kath were to separate after 20-years of marriage.

The officer was discovered dead inside his home in Blyth, Northumberland in a suspected suicide on Wednesday night.

The father-of-two had struggled to come to terms with his blindness and had posted a series of worrying tweets about his own death just days before he was found.

Yesterday, PC Rathband's twin took part in 
an emotional charity run in memory of his 
brother, saying David was with him 'every step of the way'.

Darren Rathband, 44, flew back to the UK from Australia immediately after hearing of his brother's death.

Darren told a national 
newspaper he did not believe Moat was responsible for his 
brother's death, and said it was David's decision to take his life.

Darren
said in the interview: 'It's heartbreaking he has made this decision. 
But at least it was his decision. We've got to accept it.'

Yesterday,
he was joined by sister Debbie, his wife Angie, and David's 
running partner and friend Kerry Marshall in Exhibition Park, Newcastle 
city centre.

They completed 
the Newcastle Park Run - a 5km race - for the Blue Lamp Foundation, 
alongside more than 200 other runners under overcast skies.

PC Rathband had taken part in the event in previous years, and even completed the London Marathon.

Speaking at the event, Darren said: 'I was determined not to stop, if David did it, I can do it.

'He came with us every step of they way.

'Everybody
that turned up today and cheered us along the way, that shows a good 
spirit of human nature. We seem to have lost that socially.'

The race was an emotional event, with a minute's silence held for PC Rathband at 9am before balloons were released into the sky.

PC Rathband's race partner Kerry Marshall was in tears as she crossed the finishing line, holding hands with Darren.

A label attached to her balloon read: 'RIP to my best friend David Rathband.

'Our lives have been blessed with you running with us. I will treasure our memories for the rest of my life.

'Love
you always, Kerry xxx'

Darren, wearing a Blue Lamp Foundation T-shirt, 
kept his composure throughout and lifted his hand as he finished the 
race.

An
inquest opened on Friday at South Northumberland Coroner's Court in 
Blyth heard that PC Rathband was found hanging from a banister at his 
home in Heather Lea, Blyth, Northumberland at around 7pm on Wednesday.

He was due to 
return to work with Northumbria Police in April this year and Chief 
Constable Sue Sim spoke of her devastation over his death.
