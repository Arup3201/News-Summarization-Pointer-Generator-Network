The advertising slogan ‘buy one, get
one free’ – usually associated with supermarkets – has 
been picked up by an Irish estate agent.

Auctioneer Brendan McGlynn, from Donegal, has a 
number of houses on his books and if you buy one for just over £85,000, he will 
throw in another, free of charge.

Ironically, the collapse of the Irish economy that resulted in the recent EU financial bailout, has resulted in higher borrowing costs that have since seen house prices plummet .

And in a bid to stimulate sales, Letterkenny-based Mr McGlynn has adopted the sale strategy in a stagnant property market. He said: ‘There is absolutely no catch – you buy one and you get the house next door free.

‘These are not houses on a ghost estate, far from it. We have houses in two different estates in Letterkenny and one in Milford, which are the last on each estate.

‘If we can sell them we can move on to the next estate and keep things going. Each house is a three-bedroom semi-detached dwelling and they are almost finished. Some even have kitchens and fireplaces fitted.’

No. 41 in the Gleann Rua area of Letterkenny has been put on the market for £103,185 and No. 42 comes with it. Mr McGlynn said the houses are a perfect opportunity for young people to get on the housing ladder.

The offer is an attempt to fill up vacant houses. He added: ‘There is nothing worse than seeing a few vacant houses on an estate when the rest of the area is looking well and people are living happily together.

‘It brings the tone of the area down and that’s part of the idea for doing this offer.  This could be the perfect opportunity for two young families.

‘People are finding it difficult to get money but they don’t need a huge amount of a deposit to get a house – or even two!’
