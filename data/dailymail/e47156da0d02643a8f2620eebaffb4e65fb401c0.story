The leaders of all three major political parties received bad news today after a poll revealed they are each unpopular with voters.

Neither Labour's Ed Miliband, Lib Dem Nick Clegg nor Tory David Cameron achieved a positive rating.

Mr Miliband scores lowest, at minus 21, followed by Mr Clegg at -20 and Mr Cameron at -5.

The withering verdict
on the Labour leader's first nine months in the job puts him on a par 
with failed Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith when he was in 
opposition.

However, the survey -
carried out by ICM over the weekend for the Guardian newspaper - 
revealed Labour is in fact ahead of the Liberal Democrats who have plummeted in 
the public's opinion suffering a 14-year low with a score of 12 per 
cent.

Leader popularity: Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron all have negative personal ratings - with the Labour leader's the worst

The Conservatives have clawed back a point from the Guardian's March survey to 37 per cent, whilst Labour clocked up 39 per cent.

Last night, Lord Mandelson attacked Mr Miliband for being too timid andÂ  too concerned with trade union interests.

The former Business Secretary said the party leader was failing to speak to the public about 
issues they understand and was not listening to what business wants.

The poll showed he was particularly unpopular among older voters and men.

Mr Clegg fell two points from the March poll - although he was already at -20 per cent.

Prime
Minister David Cameron's popularity has also seen better days, at minus
five, despite still being 16 points ahead of his rivals.

Honeymoon over: Nick Clegg and David Cameron give their first joint press conference. 50 per cent think the coalition Government is doing a bad job

Opinion
is divided on his success, with 42 per cent thinking he is doing a good
job, and 47 per cent think its bad leading to a score of -5, down five 
places from March and 23 from June last year.

Less popular: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne needs to claw his way back in with the public too

The Coalition government itself also appears to have fallen from favour, with fifty per cent of voters thinking the Government is doing a bad job and only 35 per cent give it the thumbs up, representing a net rating of -15 per cent.

However, it does have a 12 point lead on the economy and 40 per cent think the coalition's policies are best.

In terms of health policy and eduction, Labour has taken the lead, but in terms of taxation and public services, the coalition is ahead of the game by a small margin. It has leapt ahead on the law and order front, by 13 points and 16 points in immigration.

In June last year, when the coalition government took office, it was up 38 per cent as it enjoyed its honeymoon period.

The poll came as voters have watched the Government tackle changes to the NHS and several public sector unions announcing industrial action, the Guardian said.

Meanwhile, chancellor George Osborne also needs to claw his way back in with the public as 46 per cent believing he is doing a bad job.

He scored a net negative of -12, down 10 points from March.
