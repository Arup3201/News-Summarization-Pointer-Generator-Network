The New Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has accused Vladimir Putin of ‘sponsoring terrorism’ and delivered an ultimatum to Russia’s leader: ‘Get out of Ukraine.’

In the most outspoken response to the crisis from any senior western politician, Mr Fallon said Putin must be taught he cannot get away with ‘egging on’ Russian separatists blamed for the attack.

‘We have to make it very clear if there is any more interference like this – and it turns out he was behind it – there will be repercussions. He has to be clear the West will act.’

Outspoken: Michael Fallon has made it clear he won't let Vladimir Putin flex his muscles in Ukraine

Mr Fallon, who was made Defence Secretary in David Cameron’s reshuffle last week, and is known for his robust style, said Russia must not be allowed to grab back countries like Ukraine lost when the Iron Curtain collapsed.

He warned Putin: ‘Get out of East Ukraine and leave it to the Ukrainians.’

Mr Fallon’s tough talk was echoed by David Cameron who said last night: ‘If President Putin does not change his approach on Ukraine, then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia. This is not about military action. But it is time to make our power, influence and resources count.’

Mr Fallon also vowed to stop the crisis caused by the airliner shot down over Ukraine turning into World War Three, but said he feared the dispute could spill over into other former Soviet Union nations which have defied Putin.

He ruled out sending British soldiers to Ukraine to defend it against Russian backed attacks.  But, significantly, he did not rule out other military assistance from Britain and its NATO allies.

The RAF could provide fighter jets, as it already does to protect another part of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic state of Estonia, targeted by Putin, he suggested. And the British Government could punish Russian billionaires with money held in London.

In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Fallon, 62, said: ‘I don’t think we are at the start of World War Three, but NATO has to respond. It is clearly a threat to NATO’s Eastern flank and that’s why we must offer as much reassurance as we can, particularly to the Baltic States – that is why we have had four (RAF) Typhoons there since May.’

Asked about the risk of a major confrontation between Russia and the West, he said: ‘That is what we are working very hard to avoid.’

He said it was ‘extremely worrying’ that the Ukraine flashpoint ‘could spill over elsewhere to Moldova and states in the Caucuses.’ But he dismissed claims there was little the UK could do to stop Putin.

‘If Russia is the principal culprit, we can take further action against them and make it clear this kind of sponsored war is completely unacceptable. It is sponsored terrorism as far as people of East Ukraine are concerned. We don’t know if somebody said “let’s bring down a civil airliner, wherever it’s from,” – but we need to find out.’

Asked if Putin was ‘egging on’ Russian separatists, Mr Fallon replied: ‘Yes. That is the danger that flows from Russian activity on and over the border in the last few months. That’s why he needs to move his troops away from the border and stop interfering.

‘They need to get out of East Ukraine and leave Ukraine to the Ukrainians.’

Asked about claims that the crisis in Ukraine was the result of an attempt by Putin to rebuild the former Communist empire of the Soviet Union, Mr Fallon said: ‘There’s a pattern emerging. We saw what he did in Georgia, we’ve seen now what he’s done in Crimea and we need to respond to that.

'We need to leave Ukraine to the Ukrainians. Putin needs to move his troops from the border and stop interfering'

‘There’s no prospect of us putting boots on the ground in Ukraine, though we can assist with technology, surveillance and technical support.’

But could any British military firepower be involved?

‘We have contributed to the Baltic air policing mission by putting Typhoons into Estonia, and we will certainly do what’s needed for any of our NATO allies in providing reassurance and support.’

And what if Ukraine asked for military help from the UK?

‘That’s for NATO to respond to – I won’t be drawn,’ he said cautiously, in an interview at the Ministry of Defence on Friday.

Pressed on whether he would rule it out, Mr Fallon said: ‘We’ve not been asked to put troops on the ground in Ukraine so it’s speculation at the moment.’

However, he added the NATO summit in September ‘will have to think how it offers more reassurance to countries on its borders,’ laying emphasis on the ‘will.’

So ultimately, it must be some kind of military assistance? ‘Yes, but military assistance takes many forms: defence capacity building, technical support, sharing assets.’

As for whether there were any circumstances in which Britain would defend Ukraine from a Russian attack, he went on: ‘I’m not going to speculate. We are facing a different type of warfare, ambiguous warfare where countries like Russia appear to be acting through sponsored groups, vehicles without marking, uniforms without tabs. We need to work out a response to that.’

And what would he say to Putin if he could speak to him face to face?

‘I would say “it is completely unacceptable for a country to be involved in this kind of activity in another sovereign state.”

‘There is plenty of evidence  that financial sanctions are already affecting the Russian economy  and the ability of their bodies to trade through London. There’s a range of other sanctions available, cutting off more links with Russia. He [Putin] needs to trade with the West and relies on the City of London.’

Unlike his predecessor, super- cautious Philip Hammond, surgeon’s son Mr Fallon is known to speak his mind.

Downing Street has supported claims pro-Russian separatists were behind the missile that hit MH17

Married with two children, he first became an MP in 1983. His 21 year ‘journey’ to reach the Cabinet in his 60s flies in the face of claims that the reshuffle was designed to clear out ‘male, pale and stale’ Tories from the Prime Minister’s top table.

Clearly, Cameron does not regard Fallon as stale – or he wouldn’t have put him in the defence hot seat, with his finger on Britain’s nuclear button. And as for whether he has he seen nuclear button...

‘I’ve been briefed on the procedures,’ he mutters with an irritated sigh. Fallon’s world-weary, some would say cynical, manner, has led some to mistrust him.

He was in Tory exile when Cameron first became leader in 2005, having strongly backed rival candidate David Davis.

But his shrewd, hard-headed approach, combined with proving his loyalty in the nine intervening years, persuaded a sceptical Cameron to give him another chance.

Fallon is no one dimensional career politician. In a five year spell out of Parliament in the 1990s, he went into business with Duncan Bannatyne, of TV’s ‘Dragon’s Den.’

He has a long standing interest in defence, but no military background. Nor is it clear if he has ever fired a gun. After a long pause, he replied: ‘Not since school.’

In the Army Cadets, I suggest?

‘Yes, probably,’ was his less than emphatic reply.
