Cristiano Ronaldo is set to become the first client of rapper Lil Wayne's new sports management company.

The Portuguese superstar will not be leaving his current management, but Lil Wayne's company will be responsible for Ronaldo in the United States.

According to TMZ, they will handle: 'everything from branding to marketing and endorsement deals. Even modeling.'

Capitalising: Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to market himself more in America

Partnership: And he's joined Lil Wayne's sports management company to do so

'Weezy (Lil Wayne) has been wanting to get into the sports management game for a while and has had his sights set on the Team Portugal stud ... not just because he's a huge sports star, but because they're friends.'

Football has seen a huge burst of popularity growth in the United States following the success of their side during the World Cup this summer, with record TV ratings being recorded for games throughout the tournament.

And this move by Ronaldo shows that he is clearly keen to strike while the iron's hot and capitalise on the situation.
