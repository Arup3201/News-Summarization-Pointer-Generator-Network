Festival organisers who staged a live duck-grabbing competition have outraged animal cruelty protesters in southern China today.

Tourism officials thought they would liven up the annual Dragon Boat celebration with a bizarre contest in which swimmers tried to grab live ducks to win a prize. 

The hook-a-duck competition in Fenghuang, Hunan province, was condemned by campaigners who said many birds were injured in the event.

'The terrified ducks were hurled from a wall into the water where swimmers grabbed and snatched to catch them.

It caused them a lot of fear and pain,' said one.

However, the unrepentant organisers claimed the event was a huge success.

'It was fun, the swimmers liked it and the audience liked it,' said a tourist board spokesman.

'Any injured ducks were killed humanely and then cooked and eaten,' they added.

The Dragon Boat Festival falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar every year.

The festival pays tribute to ancient poet Qu Yuan who drowned himself as a protest against being falsely accused of treason.

Traditionally the day includes brightly coloured boat races, and now a duck race.
