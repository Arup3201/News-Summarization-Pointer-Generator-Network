The families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded two years ago at the Sandy Hook Elementary School filed a wrongful lawsuit Monday against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the rifle used in the shooting.

The negligence and wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Bridgeport Superior Court, asserts that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle should not have been made publicly available because it was designed for military use and is unsuited for hunting or home defense.

'The AR-15 was specifically engineered for the United States military to meet the needs of changing warfare,' attorney Josh Koskoff, of law firm Koskoff, Koffkoff & Bieder, said in a press release. 'In fact, one of the Army's specifications for the AR-15 was that it has the capability to penetrate a steel helmet.'

Going for the guns: The families nine of the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and a teacher who was wounded in the December 2012 incident,  have filed a lawsuit targeting the makers of Bushmaster rifles.

Defendant: The lawsuit names the gun manufacturer Bushmaster, distributor Camfour, and Riverview Gun Sales (pictured) where Nancy Lanza purchased the rifle in March 2010 

In addition to Bushmaster, the defendants are Camfour, a firearm distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, the Connecticut store where gunman Adam Lanza's mother Nancy purchased the Bushmaster rifle in 2010.

Messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned.

Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the shooting, said he believes in the Second Amendment but also that the gun industry needs to be held to 'standard business practices' when it comes to assuming the risk for producing, making and selling a product.

'These companies assume no responsibility for marketing and selling a product to the general population who are not trained to use it nor even understand the power of it,' he said.

The plaintiffs include Sherlach and the families of Vicki Soto, Dylan Hockley, Noah Pozner, Lauren Rousseau, Benjamin Wheeler, Jesse Lewis, Daniel Barden, Rachel D'Avino and teacher Natalie Hammond, who was injured in the shooting.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages.

Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mother, planned a news conference later Monday morning with U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.

The Newtown gunman, Adam Lanza, shot and killed his mother Nancy on the morning of December 14, 2012, before driving to the school and shooting through the entrance. 

Principal  Dawn Hochspring and school psychologist Mary Scherlach confronted Lanza at the front of the school, but he shot them dead and fired several shots at teacher Natalie Hammond, who survived after crawling into a meeting room.

Chaos: The scene near Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012 - the day Lanza went on his deadly rampage

Aurora, Colorado: Shooter James Holmes killed 12 people and wounded 58 when he opened fire on a film screening of The Dark Knight. He was armed with an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns.

Portland, Oregon: James Tyler Roberts stole a AR-15 to shoot dead two people in the food court of the Clackamas Town Center Mall in December 2012.

Santa Monica, California: Gunman John Zawahri assembled an AR-15-style gun to go on a rampage at his father's home and Santa Monica College in June 2013, killing five people.

Crandon, Wisconsin: Tyler Peterson shot dead seven people, including himself, using an AR-15 at a post-homecoming party in October 2007

Lanza then went into two classrooms where she shot 20 children and four more school personnel, including two teachers, before committing suicide as police arrived.

In the lawsuit, lawyers for the victims say the gun is to blame for the sheer amount of casualties.

'The number of lives lost in those 263 seconds was made possible by the shooter's weapon of choice,' the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit goes on to say that while the AR-15 is an efficient weapon on the battlefield, 'engineered to deliver maximum carnage', it has 'little utility for legitimate civilian purposes' and is especially dangerous is the hands of the mentally unstable, like Lanza. 

'There is one tragically predictable civilian activity in which the AR-15 reigns supreme: mass shootings,' the suit says. 'Time and again, mentally unstable individuals and criminals have acquired an AR-15 with ease, and they have unleashed the rifle's lethal power into our streets, our malls, our places of worship, and our schools.'

'The risk of a mentally unstable individual gaining access to an assault rifle and unleashing its military firepower on innocent civilians is not theoretical for Bushmaster. It's a fact,' the law firm's  Katie Mesner-Hage added in the press release.

The suit also points out that the AR-15 is only slightly different from the M-16, a weapon banned outside the military.

Spot the difference? The lawsuit claims that an AR-15 is not suited for civilian use either for home security or hunting. Above, the AR-15's military counterpart, the M-16, which civilians are banned from using 

Instead of downplaying the military quality of the weapon, the lawsuit says the gun's manufacturer markets the AR-15 as a combat-style gun, citing advertising campaigns and catalogs.

One advertising campaign called the AR-15 'the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission adaptable as you are' while a catalogue said the weapon had 'military-proven performance'.

'Forces of opposition, bow down. You are single-handedly outnumbered,' another line of chilling advertising copy read.

In 2005, Congress and President George W. Bush approved a federal law that shielded gun makers from lawsuits over criminal use of their products, with some exemptions.

In a lawsuit over the .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle used in the Washington, D.C.-area sniper shootings that killed 10 people in 2002, Bushmaster and a gun dealer agreed to pay $2.5million to two survivors and six families in a 2004 settlement. It was the first time a gun manufacturer had agreed to pay damages to settle claims of negligent distribution of weapons, according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

In that settlement, Bushmaster paid $550,000 and the Washington state gun dealer, where the sniper's rifle came from, paid $2million.

In 2002, a federal judge in California ruled that Bushmaster and other gun manufacturers were not responsible for a 1999 shooting spree that killed a postal worker and injured five people at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. The judge said a lawsuit by the victims' families did not show a link between the manufacturers and the shooting rampage. 

Dark day: Sunday marked the two-year anniversary of the massacre, and again the town of Newtown, Connecticut refused to hold memorial services for the horrific incident. However, they did acknowledge the day by hanging the flag on Main Street at half-staff 

The act's exception is for negligent entrustment lawsuits in which a party can be held accountable for selling a weapon to another party who uses said weapon to cause harm to a third party.

In order to win their case, the Sandy Hook families must prove that Bushmaster committed negligent entrustment by putting the AR-15 on the market.

Dennis Heningan, the former director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, explained the legal argument to the Wall Street Journal.

'The issue in this case will be whether courts are willing to construe the doctrine of negligent entrustment so broadly as to encompass a theory of liability that is based on the sale of a particular gun to the general public instead of to a potentially particular dangerous individual,' Mr Heningan told the Journal.

Gun lobbyists have contentiously debated the idea that manufacturers are to blame for the shootings, saying it's not weapons who kill people - it's the people who shoot them.

'It’s very easy to blame an inanimate object. Any kind of instrument in the wrong hands can be put to evil use. This comes down to intent - criminal behavior, accountability and responsibility,' George Kollitides, chief executives of the Remington Outdoor Company said in a June 2013 interview with the Washington Times. Remington has owned the Bushmaster gun brand since a merger in 2011. 

For the victims' families, suing Bushmaster is a way of attempting to bring about change in the gun industry, an issue Congress has failed to address.

'If nothing is going to change federally, we might as well try' in court, Carlos Soto, brother of killed Sandy Hook teacher Vicki Soto, told the Wall Street Journal.
