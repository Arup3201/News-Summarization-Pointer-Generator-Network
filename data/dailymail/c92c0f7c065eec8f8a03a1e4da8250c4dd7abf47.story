A 28-year-old Oklahoma middle school teacher is facing charging of exchanging inappropriate messages with a 14-year-old student for two years.

According to investigators, Whitney Fetters, a Spanish teacher at Hefner Middle School in Putnam City, met the victim when he was 12 years old and the two began sending each other innocuous texts.

But police say what started out as an innocent exchange of electronic missives took a criminal turn in December, when Fetters and the student allegedly began conversing via text about sexual acts.

Fetters is suspected of swapping X-rated photos and videos with the teenager, including sending him nude photos of herself.

The 28-year-old woman is expected to be charged with lewd proposals to a child under 16 and soliciting sexual communication through technology.

Police learned of the alleged relationship between Fetters and the minor late last month when the student's parents found the pictures and contacted them.

Fetters' arrest warrant states that the teacher and the victim began texting when he was 12 and a student in her Spanish class at Hefner Middle School.

Court documents cited by News9 indicate that the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot.' The text was accompanied by a partially nude photo of the boy.

Police say the woman and the boy half her age proceeded to swap at least 20 X-rated photos, videos of themsleves performing sex acts and explicit snap chats.

The 28-year-old educator is also accused of inviting the student over to spend the night with her this coming Friday so they could 'get high and have sex,’ but police found about their relationship and intervened in time.

During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad.

Documents state that the 14-year-old, who is now in high school, had made an attempt to cover up his relationship with the Spanish teacher by trying to delete the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to collect and review all the evidence.

Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher January 30. Fetters has not been back to the school since.

The station WSET reported that one text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read: ‘Touching myself is fun.’ Another featured a photo of the 28-year-old wearing only her underwear with a suggestive text that read, ‘That’s all you get.’
