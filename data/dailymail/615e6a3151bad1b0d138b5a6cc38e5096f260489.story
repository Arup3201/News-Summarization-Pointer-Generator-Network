The parents of a 21-year-old woman killed by a wrong-way driver have revealed they arrived at the scene of the accident after tracking her on a locator app when he missed her curfew.

Marisa Caran Catronio died early on Sunday morning after her friend's 2012 Toyota Camry was hit head-on by a 20-year-old driver on the Sawgrass Expressway near Coral Springs, Florida.

Her best friend Kaitlyn Nicole Ferrante, who was driving the Camry, remains in critical condition in Broward Health North after the crash.

Marisa's devastated father Gary revealed that they had become concerned after the women failed to return home before their 2am curfew so they used an app that tracked her cellphone.

Driver: Kayla Mendoza was allegedly driving the wrong way and hit the girls. She remains in serious condition

At 2.11am he said he could tell that their car had stopped on the expressway, so he and other family members headed there - and came across the tragic scene, the Sun Sentinel reported.

'I'll never hug my little girl again,' Gary wept as he spoke to NBC Miami outside his home.

The women had been heading 
home to Coral Springs after a night out on Saturday when they were hit 
by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Kayla Maria Mendoza, 20, of 
Hallandale Beach, officials said.

Marisa was pronounced 
dead at the scene shortly after the 1.45am crash, the Florida Highway Patrol reported.

Distraught: Marisa's father, Gary, sobbed as he said he would never be able to hug his daughter again

Loved: Mr Catronio is now calling on highways to install spikes or flashing lights to warn wrong-way drivers they are headed for danger. He is pictured with his daughter Marisa, whom he called 'full of life'

Both Ferrante and Mendoza were taken to 
Broward Health North, where Mendoza is listed in serious condition, said 
FHP Sgt. Mark Wysocky.

Investigations are underway to determine how the crash occurred and why Mendoza was driving on the wrong side of the road.

Gary Catronio now hopes to launch a 
campaign to have highway access ramps fitted with spikes or flashing 
warning lights to signal drivers going the wrong way.

'My little girl is not here anymore 
because of the negligence of a driver driving on the wrong side of the 
highway,' he told NBC. 'This has to be stopped. We've got to do 
something to prevent this.'

'Full of life': The girls had been heading back from a night out when they were hit by the other car

Loved: Her brother shared these images on Facebook. She leaves behind two young brothers

Catronio is now making funeral arrangements for his beloved daughter, whom he remembered as 'full of life'. He said that Marisa, who worked at a pediatrics office, loved fashion and baking.

Marisa also leaves behind her mother, Natalie, and brothers Jesse, 19, and Dustin, 17.

The family members paid tribute to Marisa on Facebook, sharing photos of the young woman.

Jesse wrote: 'Best big sister in the world! No one can ever replace you. You were always there for me and helped me through so much. I love you and you'll never be forgotten.'

Marisa's funeral will be held on Friday.
