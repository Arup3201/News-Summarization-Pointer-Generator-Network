Cornwall already fills millions of holidaymakers with  pasties and lashings of cream teas every year.

Now the country, which is home to England's first and only tea producer, is supplying the cuppas for thousands of thirsty passengers on First Great Western Trains.

The new partnership with Tregothnan estate, near Truro, will see one million bags of home-grown tea being brewed on FGW trains this year, making it one of the plantation's largest customers.

A British tea company has inked a deal to supply one million teabags to First Great Western Trains. To celebrate, passengers on board a FGW train from Paddington to Cornwall were treated to a quintessentially English tea party, complete with the world's largest fully-functioning tea pot, which brews over 300 cups

Tregothnan estate near Truro, Cornwall will supply First Great Western Trains with the teabags

Tregothnan, home to the Boscawen family, began supplying England's first and only tea, which partly comprises locally-grown leaves, in 2005.

Home to the Boscawen family, the private Tregothnan estate near Truro has persevered in pioneering botanical firsts since 1334. 

They first began supplying England’s first and only tea in 2005. 

As well as growing English tea and a range of herbal infusions, they also produce sustainable coppiced charcoal, Cornish Manuka and wildflower honeys, and Kea plum jam. 

British flowers from the Tregothnan estate and surrounding lands are cut for their range of hand-tied seasonal English bouquets. 

The new venture will mean six new jobs in propagating, horticulture, guest services, website and social media, processing, blending and packing at Tregothnan. 

This will contribute to the company's expected growth of 60 per cent this year.

Jonathan Jones, director of Tregothnan, said 'This is a truly historic partnership for us - it is great to see a company like First Great Western investing in the region and supporting local suppliers.

'One million tea bags will see us hire new staff and roll out more goods than ever.'

The tea will be available from FGW's Express Café, Night Riviera Sleeper Café and the Pullman.

Jo Elliott, from FGW, said 'We are thrilled to be working with a local supplier to bring quality, home-grown produce to our passengers.

'We aim to source all the produce on our trains from local suppliers and producers, and by choosing a Cornish supplier from within our network, First Great Western is a step closer to achieving that goal.'

Nutritionist Angela Dowden investigates the most popular types of tea and gives them a health rating out of five.

Oolong tea 

Oolong tea

Cuppa quota: 1-2 cups daily.

Health rating: 4/5

A cross between green and black tea, this partially fermented variety has a light, delicate flavour often likened to peaches.

Healthwise, it has almost as much antioxidant power as the better known green tea, so drinking it regularly will help to boost your defences against heart disease and cancer. Japanese researchers found that exposing human stomach cancer cells to an extract of oolong tea stimulated an increase in tumour cell destruction.

Drink it after a meal as a digestive aid, or after alcohol as a protection against a hangover. Jasmine is a scented oolong tea with the same health properties, prepared by piling jasmine flowers next to dried green leaves so they absorb the fragrance.

Breakfast tea

Cuppa quota: 1-2 cups daily. Any type of black tea is better not drunk with meals because it can reduce iron absorption.

Health rating: 4/5

Black (fermented) tea supplies 75 per cent of the UK population's intake of dietary flavonoids - antioxidants which reduce blood-clotting and the deposition of cholesterol in blood vessels.

Breakfast blends are among the best contributors because they contain a traditionally strong mixture of Indian Assam and Ceylon varieties. Results from one study suggest that higher intake of flavonoids protect against coronary heart disease.

Breakfast tea provides more stimulant properties than other teas, but not the harsh jolt of coffee because the caffeine it contains is quite poorly absorbed. Ordinary teabags are also one of the largest providers of fluoride in our diets - on average, tea provides up to 70 per cent of our total intake of this mineral, which can help in reducing tooth decay.

Green tea 

Early grey tea

Cuppa quota: 3-4 cups daily.

Health rating: 3/4

Its delicate flavour comes from added bergamot (a type of citrus fruit) which, according to traditional herbal medicine, helps protect against colds and chest infections.

A favourite time to drink a cup of fragrant Earl Grey is after eating, when it can help to digest a fatty meal. Essential oils in tea aid digestion by encouraging digestive enzyme production. 

However, Earl Grey's more delicate flavour means it has a lower content of disease protective antioxidants.

Green tea

Cuppa quota: Around a mugful daily.

Health rating: 5/5

Green tea has half the caffeine content of black tea, and laboratory tests suggest it has an even higher antioxidant activity.

The growth of cancer cells isolated from the lung, breast and stomach can be inhibited by incubation with epigallocatechin gallate, one of green tea's active ingredients. And research suggests that regular consumption may help prevent prostate cancer deaths.

Green tea also seems to stimulate beneficial gut bacteria called Bifidobacteria, which help keep gastric infections at bay and maintain digestive health. It seems about half a pint of green tea is needed daily to exert these beneficial effects.
