The remains of two dinosaurs that were perfectly preserved in a bitter fight to the death are to be sold for a record £6 million.

The fossil of the 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops locked in mortal combat were discovered entirely by chance.

They are said to be among the most important dinosaur discoveries of all time.

The fossils of a Tyrannosaurus and a Triceretops locked in mortal combat were discovered entirely by chance - but are said to be among the most important dinosaur discoveries of all time. The complete skeletons are in such good condition they reveal the giant 8ft-tall beasts both died from wounds inflicted by one another

The complete skeletons reveal the giant 8ft-tall beasts both died from wounds inflicted by one another.

To the amazement of scientists, some of the meat-eating Tyrannosaurus's razor-sharp teeth were found lodged in the Triceratops' skull.

The savage Tyrannosaur's skull and chest have been crushed by a massive blow inflicted by the herbivore Triceratops.

Experts believe the dinosaurs were covered over by debris from an earthquake shortly after they died.

Triceratops were the prey of Tyrannosaurus, which shared its lands in what is now North America.Triceratops, meaning 'three horned face', lived off low growing plants while Tyrannosaurus, 'tyrant lizard', hunted other dinosaurs.

A theory proposed last year suggested that the Tyrannosaurus Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures.Research into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour.

They have been so well preserved that some of the bones are still covered in soft tissue.

The fossil was accidently discovered by a ranch owner in Montana, US, and excavated by fossil hunter Clayton Phipps, also known as the 'Dino Cowboy'.

Scientists believe that shortly after they died there was an earthquake that buried the bodies.

They have been kept at a research lab in Montana since their discovery in 2006.

The dinosaurs have since been identified as Nanotyrannus lancensis, a close relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, and Chasmosaurine ceratopsian from the Triceratops family.

Nanotyrannus is thought to have been a small but extremely dangerous little tyrannosaur.

Its head was about the length of an adult man's arm and could run up to 30 kilometers in short spurts.

Thomas Lindgren, from Bonhams' natural history department (pictured) said he hopes the fossils are bought by a museum so they can go on public display. 'These dinosaurs represent one of the most significant fossil finds of all time,' he said

The huge fossil, which dates back to the end of the Cretaceous period around 68 million years ago, could break the world record for the most expensive dinosaur fossil, set in 1997 when 'Sue', a Tyrannosaurus rex, sold for £5.4 million.

Thomas Lindgren, from Bonhams' natural history department, said he hopes the fossils are bought by a museum so they can go on public display.

‘The fossils were discovered purely by chance on a ranch in Montana.

'The rancher spotted some bone fragments in the ground one day and called in Clayton Phipps, the Dino Cowboy.

‘They unearthed what they thought was a Triceratops skeleton which would have been amazing on it's own - but then they spotted some vertebrae nearby.

‘Incredibly, they turned out to be from another dinosaur, a Tyrannosaurus.

Lindgren added that had they been found apart, each of these fossils would have been the most complete skeletons ever found.

'But what makes the story even more amazing is that these dinosaurs were clearly locked in a bitter fight to the death that killed both of them,' he said.

‘The Tyrannosaurus's skull and chest have been crushed, while some of its teeth are embedded in the Triceratops' skull.

‘The Triceretops is huge, suggesting it was elderly, and clearly the Tyrannosaur thought he could take it out but the Triceretops was wise and powerful and had other ideas.

‘We really hope a scientific institution will come forward to ensure these incredible fossils get the treatment they deserve, then go on public display for all to see.’

The auction will take place at Bonhams in New York on November 19.
