A police force had to pay £2,000 in compensation to a car thief after he was bitten by a police dog while in the middle of a break-in.

The unnamed man was injured when he tried to flee after being confronted by a dog handler while breaking into a vehicle in the Meadows area of Nottingham.

It is believed he spent several days in hospital.

The payout came to light following a Freedom of Information request regarding people who had sued Nottinghamshire Police over dog bites in the past three years.

Bite worse than bark: Nottinghamshire Police force have paid out a total of £19,000 over three years to six claimants who were bitten by police dogs, a Freedom of Information request reveals

In total, over £19,000 has been paid to six claimants.

A spokesman for the force said he was unable to discuss individual cases, or comment on when the incident took place.

But he said: 'When a person or suspect is bitten by a police dog, there are robust procedures in place to ensure that it is recorded, reviewed and assessed whether any further action is necessary, including a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

'Any claim for compensation is investigated thoroughly to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident. The result of the investigation will determine whether the applicant is successful or if their claim is rejected.

'The training, deployment and management of police dogs within Nottinghamshire Police is constantly reviewed and developed in order to maintain the highest possible standards of professionalism and welfare.

'A dog handler will always instruct a 
suspect to stand still and not run away. In some cases this instruction 
is ignored, and as the dogs are trained to pursue and restrain 
individuals, they will be detained by the dog, and this may result in a 
dog bite.'

'Every dog utilised by the Force undergoes additional training throughout the year, specifically around bite control, which is in line with national requirements and must be completed in order for any police dog to maintain its national licence'.

All 16 general purpose police dogs within Nottinghamshire Police are used to assist with general patrols and are deployed to all types of incidents.

All of the dogs are trained in detaining suspects and or anyone who poses a threat to the public.
