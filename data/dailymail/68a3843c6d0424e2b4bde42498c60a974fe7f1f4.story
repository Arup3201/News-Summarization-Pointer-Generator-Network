Resignation: Mr Phillips will step down to make way for a full-scale reshaping of his troubled organisation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission

The chief of the state equality quango, former Labour politician Trevor Phillips, is to leave his job this summer, it was revealed yesterday.

Mr Phillips will step down to make way for a full-scale reshaping of his troubled organisation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

A report from the Commission confirmed that it is to get a new leader whose task will be to ‘increase our impact and deliver better value for money.’

The departure of Mr Phillips, who earns £112,000 a year for a three-and-a-half day week, is likely to ease tensions between the quango and Coalition ministers.

In recent months Home Secretary Theresa May has published a highly critical report about the Commission, stripped it of its right to make its own grants of state money, and made severe cuts to its funding.

The 58-year-old chair of the EHRC was chosen by Tony Blair to head Labour’s newly-created equality superquango in 2006.

Mr Phillips was re-appointed to the Commission three years later by then Equality Minister Harriet Harman, despite growing controversy over the style of his leadership.

In recent years a number of commissioners have quit alleging management failings and there have been a series of concerns over the way money has been spent.

The Commission has also been troubled by clashes between the different interest groups it is supposed to represent.

Christians in particular have been angered by the way it has backed legal test cases which campaigners say erode the right to abide by Christian beliefs. Notably the

Commission backed a same-sex couple who successfully sued a Christian couple for refusing them a double room in their guest house.

Mrs May published a report last year which said the Commission had given away £10 million a year in grants to equality groups without knowing where much of the money went, and that it ran an advice helpline that helped just 73 people in a year at a cost of £5,000 each.

She said of the organisation: 'Unfortunately, since its establishment the Commission has struggled to deliver against its remit and provide value for money.’

Mr Phillips is expected to quit when his contract runs out in September. Ministers are understood to have been engaged in attempts to identify and recruit a successor.

A report from the Commission yesterday said that in future it will have to operate on little more than a third of the money Labour lavished on it when it was launched as a successor to three separate earlier equality quangos.

It will have £26.8 million a year to spend by 2015 as opposed to a £70 million a year budget under Labour.

The ‘strategic plan’ published yesterday said: ‘During 2012, we will see the Government’s conclusions to their consultation on reform of the Commission, including possible legislative changes to our powers and functions, the appointment of a new chair, and possible other changes to the board.’

It added that the changes will ‘provide space for the Commission’s new leadership to return to the strategy and complete the picture.’

In future ‘building productive relationships with a range of government bodies will be a priority,’ the report said.

‘Learning from the past, we have not sought to be all things to all people in this strategy. Our decision to focus on doing fewer things well will mean we should increase our impact and deliver better value for money.’

Mr Phillips is a former television executive who became a Labour politician and then a front man for Tony Blair’s government as it tried to deal with ethnic and religious tensions.

A anti-racist campaigner once linked with multicultural ideas – a report from a charity linked to Mr Phillips once suggested the word British was racist – he became a Labour politician in London.

However he dropped his ambitions for a political career, with one possible reason being antipathy in the Labour Party to his decision to send his two daughters to an independent school.

He became head of the Commission for Racial Equality in 2003 and went on to the EHRC.

Mr Phillips was a central figure in the retreat from multiculturalism – the left-wing doctrine which encouraged migrants to keep their own culture rather than integrate into British ways.

After the 2005 London bombings he warned that the country was ‘sleepwalking towards segregation.'
