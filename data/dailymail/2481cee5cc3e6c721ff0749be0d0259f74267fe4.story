A California judge threw out a 124-year prison term handed down a decade ago to an heir to the Max Factor fortune for raping three women and related crimes, ruling on Monday that the original sentencing had been improper.

Andrew Luster will receive a new sentencing hearing in April but the judge declined to give the 49-year-old a new trial.

Luster was convicted in 2003 in absentia of 86 counts including rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an unconscious person and sexual battery. He fled to Mexico during the trial.

Also on Monday, bounty hunter Duane Lee 'Dog' Chapman, the man who captured Luster in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta, revealed that he got a vital tip-off about the fugitive's hiding place from Luster's own attorney, the late Richard Sherman.

Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, was caught in 2003 by Chapman, in a development that helped propel Chapman to fame and his own reality TV show.

The make-up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing, and Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Stoltz ruled on Monday that the judge who sent him to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them run concurrently.

'The previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing will be held,' Stoltz wrote in her 28-page opinion that also denied him a new trial. The judge set an April 4 sentencing hearing for Luster.

Attorneys for the Max Factor heir had argued he deserved one, in part because his original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one lawyer, Richard Sherman, gave him ill-conceived advice to flee to Mexico.

Bounty hunter and TV star, Chapman told Radar Online that Sherman gave him very useful clues as to Luster's location.

As Radar Online reports, Sherman passed away in April 2011. The lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client's hiding place.

But according to 'Dog' the attorney did give him the information, in a very subtle way.

'Sherman became very nice to me,' Chapman explained to Radar. 'We used to tease each other. And at one point he said to me, "I’m going to tell you something Dog, so don’t be so dumb."

And then he said, "The guy (Luster) speaks Spanish. Do you get it?"'

The bounty hunter immediately understood. 'I had leads that pointed to Thailand and Mexico,' he said. 'Right then I dropped all my leads on Thailand and focused on Mexico.'

Chapman captured Luster in June 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico.

On Monday, Stoltz wrote that Luster's attorneys did not fail him at trial, and she rejected his current lawyers' arguments that Luster was manipulated into fleeing.

'Although several witnesses did describe Luster as 'childlike,' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund, and he lived the life of a carefree 'beach bum,' Stoltz wrote.

She added that Luster, who spent much of his time surfing, described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading, and that he did not appear to have a low IQ.

Luster was found guilty of giving three women the date rape drug GHB and raping them while they were unconscious or intoxicated. Video tape Luster took of his sexual acts with the women was presented against him at trial.
