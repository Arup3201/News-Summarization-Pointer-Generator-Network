Having a fall and a bump to the head should be a cause for concern, but for one color-blind man the black-and-white fact of the matter is that it was a blessing in disguise – because afterwards he could see ‘the colors of the rainbow’.

Richard Riggs, 70, from Yakima in Washington State, was born color-blind, but his sight was transformed after he fell over and hurt his head.

Scientists were baffled and the music teacher, unsurprisingly, was delighted.

He told Kima TV: ‘As a 70-year-old man I fall quite a lot, as a matter of fact, cause my legs are not strong. I've been color-blind since I was born, and at age 70 I see colors of the rainbow now.

‘Every March we take a trip to Hawaii, I can't wait to get there with my new color sense and watch the flowers... and the bikinis.’

He added: ‘The old-fashioned Walt Disney slogan was “The world is a carousel of color”. I get it now. I'm seeing the world that way.’

Color-blindness affects one in 12 men and one in 200 women, according to Colourblindawareness.org.

It’s normally caused by a genetic pigment defect in the eye, so falling shouldn’t be able to cure it.

A doctor told Kima TV that he was unable to explain Mr Riggs’ new-found colorful sight, but speculated that he may just be perceiving colors differently.
