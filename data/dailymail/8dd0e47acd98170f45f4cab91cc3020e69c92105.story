China's new president Xi Jinping was officially introduced to the nation today, but to many Chinese citizens it is the face of his glamorous pop star wife that will appear far more familiar.

The Communist Party leader-elect and powerful military chief is married to Peng Liyuan, the syrup-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music.

Nicknamed the Peony Fairy, Ms Peng, 49, had graced television screens in the world's most populous country for more than a decade, her honeyed tones punctuating state-run TV shows watched by hundreds of millions of people.

Ms Peng has become China's first high-profile political spouse since Jiang Qing, the late wife of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Her huge success in the entertainment industry has run alongside her staunch loyalty to the Communist Party.

She joined the People's Liberation Army aged 18 and rose to the rank of major-general, a post she still holds.

But when her superiors discovered her talent for singing, she began touring army bases serenading troops in a programme designed to boost morale.

From there her rise to fame was meteoric. She is best known for performing at CCTV's New Year's Gala - a show watched by hundreds of millions of people throughout China - almost every year since its inception in 1982.

The new team: He and the six other men who will form China's new collective leadership, all dressed in dark suits, walked in line onto the red-carpeted stage. (L-R) Liu Yunshan, Zhang Dejiang, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Yu Zhengsheng and Wang Qishan.

Almost all of her songs are in praise
of the Communist Party and frequently appears on state television to 
sing propagandist ballads with names including Plains of Hope and People From Our Village.

In June 2011, she was even appointed World Health Organisation Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/Aids and tuberculosis.

She has also shied away from appearing in public with her husband or talking about their relationship until recently, fuelling speculation that she may take a more active role in his presidency than any of her predecessors.

In a rare interview in 2007, she told a state-run magazine: 'When he comes home, I’ve never thought of it as though there’s some leader in the house.

'In my eyes, he’s just my husband. When I get home, he doesn’t think of me as some famous star. In his eyes, I’m simply his wife.'

But while hers is still one of the most 
famous faces in the country, comparatively little is known of her 
husband, a man who spent most of his teens living in a cave, labouring
in the fields of one of China's poorest regions.

He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao.

But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison.

Xi
was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi 
province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in 
the fields. Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions.

The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village.

He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man.

But he immersed himself in local 
politics and soon rose the ranks before today assuming the top posts in 
the Communist Party and the powerful military in a political transition 
unbowed by scandals, a slower economy and public demands for reforms.

Xi
was introduced as the new party general secretary at Beijing's Great 
Hall of the People a day after the close of a week-long party congress 
that underlined the communists' determination to remain firmly in power.

Get used to this face: Xi's inaugural address as the country's new leader was broadcast on giant screens across China. Here, above a McDonald's in Beijing

Out with the old: President Hu Jintao, left, and senior leaders mostly in their 
late 60s will hand over power to Xi Jinping, right, and other 
colleagues in their late 50s over the next several months

He and the six other men who will form China's new collective leadership, all dressed in dark suits, walked in line onto the red-carpeted stage.

Xi's appointment as chairman of the military commission, announced by the state Xinhua News Agency, marked a break from the recent tradition of retiring leaders holding onto the post for a transitional period to extend their influence.

It meant outgoing leader Hu Jintao would relinquish all positions of power, giving Xi broader leeway to consolidate his authority.

No surprise: The once-a-decade leadership change was carefully choreographed. It became clear Xi would lead China five years ago

The once-a-decade leadership change 
was carefully choreographed. It became clear Xi would lead China five 
years ago, when he was appointed to the Standing Committee - the 
nation's apex of power - as the highest-ranked member who would not be 
of retirement age this year.

Very little is known about Xi Jinping's upbringing - or his rise to power.

He is married to a popstar called Peng Liyuan who, for most of Xi's career, has been more famous than him.

Chinese often tell a well-known joke: 'Who is Xi Jinping? Why, he is the husband of Peng Liyuan.'

He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao.

But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison.

Xi
was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi 
province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in 
the fields.

Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions.

The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village.

He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man.

After leaving Liangjiahe, Xi headed to the busy coastal provinces that form China's industrial heartland.

He quickly climbed the ranks to become the most senior party official first in Fujian, before Zhejiang and finally Shanghai.

There he developed the mind for business and economics that he is known for today.

Now
with exports and the economy slowing, China hopes his skills can help 
get the nation back on track to overtaking America and becoming the 
biggest economy in the world.

Xi's
colleagues in the new Standing Committee are Li Keqiang, the 
presumptive premier and chief economic official; Vice Premier Zhang 
Dejiang; Shanghai party secretary Yu Zhengsheng; propaganda chief Liu 
Yunshan; Vice Premier Wang Qishan; and Tianjin party secretary Zhang 
Gaoli.

In a speech 
broadcast live on Chinese state TV and worldwide, Xi said, 'We shall do 
everything we can to live up to your trust and fulfill our mission.'

'There
are also many pressing problems within the party that need to be 
resolved, particularly corruption,' Xi said.

'We must make every effort 
to solve these problems. The whole party must stay on full alert.'

The other six leaders were expressionless with their arms at their sides during Xi's 20-minute speech, then smiled to the audience when they walked off stage.

The son of a party elder, and vice president for the past five years, Xi will lead the world's No. 2 economy and newest diplomatic and military power amid increasingly vocal calls for economic and political reform - including from within the 82-million-member party itself.

At ease in front of people and with colleagues, Xi takes over the party leadership from the stiff, technocratic Hu, and is expected to assume the largely ceremonial presidency in March.

The ascent of Xi and Li, the premier-in-waiting, represents a generational change.

Though they spent their youths laboring on farms, their university years and early careers took place when China was casting off the planned economy and turning to the free market and to the West.

They are thought to be more open to new ideas than their predecessors, but nonetheless bound by China's consensus-oriented politics.

Thursday marked only the second tidy 
transition since communist rule was established in 1949, despite a 
turbulent political year that saw the downfall in a murder and 
corruption scandal of rising populist Bo Xilai, who had been seen as a 
key contender for the new leadership slate.

The
outgoing Hu oversaw a decade of turgid economic growth and urban 
development and tried to make concern for ordinary people the hallmark 
of his tenure, but he also will be remembered for harshly stifling 
dissent and rolling back civil liberties.

At
the same time, increased social freedoms have created a generation of 
Chinese who are more aware of their rights and more vocal about 
demanding them.
