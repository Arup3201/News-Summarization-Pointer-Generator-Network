Her father is facing his last appeal against a tax fraud prison sentence.

But that hasn't stopped Barbara Berlusconi, his glamorous daughter, from relaxing in the sun in Sardinia.

The former Italian Prime Minister's daughter was pictured on Tuesday getting close to economics student Lorrenzo Guerrieri.

Relaxing: Barbara Berlusconi, the daughter of Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, looked relaxed yesterday with her new love interest despite news that her father's final appeal will happen later this month

The couple looked happy in each 
other's company as they sunbathed on a jetty of the Mediterranean island's Villa Certosa, in Porto 
Rondo, and swam in the clear waters.

The pictures may draw a line under the end of Miss Berlusoni's relationship with footballer Alexandre Pato.

The couple were together for two years
and five months but split in March - two months after they were 
separated by 12,000 miles due to the footballer's move to Corinthians.

Close: The pair chat with a friend, Miss Berlusconi embraced by Mr Guerrieri

Stripping off: Miss Berlusconi undresses to join her friends and beau sunbathing on the jetty

Now it seems Miss Berlusconi is smitten with academic Mr Guerrieri.

The economics student, who works in a 
wine shop in the evenings to pay for his degree, seems relaxed and happy
in the company of the former premier's daughter.

Accompanied by a couple of friends, they seem a million miles away from any worries about Miss Berlusoni's father.

After a series of court cases and 
subsequent appeals against a tax fraud conviction, Mr Berlusconi has 
just one attempt left in a couple of weeks to try to avoid being jailed for 
four years.

The former Prime Minister's defence team has until July 30 to prepare his final appeal case.

Italy is renowned for its slow 
judicial processes, particularly when it comes to appeals, and the court
date, in just three weeks, has outraged his lawyers.

Quoted by Reuters news agency, Franco 
Coppi, Berlusconi's lawyer, said: 'I have never seen a hearing 
programmed as quickly as this. I am astonished.

Happy couple: There is little space between the two as they soak up the sun together

Relaxed: The well-toned student looks completely relaxed in the company of the former premier's daughter

Getting close: Student Lorenzo is studying economics and works in a wine bar in the evenings to pay for his degree

'This is a real squeeze on the rights of the defense.'

The early hearing could prevent the statute of limitations expiring on one charge.

Mr Berlusconi was convicted of a tax 
fraud in relation to artificially inflating the prices of film 
distribution rights bought by his company, Mediaset.

Miss Berlusconi split from former boyfriend, footballer Alexandre Pato, in March this year

Miss Berlusconi appears to be playing up to the attention

The former premier failed to convince a
court in May in his first appeal. The court upheld his four-year jail 
term and his five-year ban from public office.

The 76-year-old denies the charges of tax fraud and says they are politically motivated.

The hearing at the end of the month 
will be the former premier's final chance to overturn the conviction and
subsequent sentence.

Cooling off:Â  The couple take a dip in the sea to cool off

However, some analysts have said he may still be able to avoid jail due to his age.

The tax fraud trial in one of a string of judicial proceedings against Italy's former premier, in recent years.

Last month he was sentenced to seven 
years in prison and banned from public office for having sex with an 
underage prostitute, and abuse of power.

Smitten: The couple looked smitten as they left the resort after a day in the sun
