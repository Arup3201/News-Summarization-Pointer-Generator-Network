The BBC's flagship rural current affairs programme Countryfile has come under fire after an investigation found it had given undue prominence to an outdoor clothing range.

The BBC Trust has censured the show after viewers complained presenters had been seen wearing Rab jackets in back-to-back episodes.

Programme-makers said it was 'unfortunate' that the presenters should have chosen to wear the same brand of Rab outer wear, but said that it was 'coincidence rather than collusion'.

They added that Countryfile presenters, who include Julia Bradbury, Matt Baker and John Craven, supply their own clothing and choose what they wear on shoots.

The
BBC Trust's editorial standards committee, which did not identify any presenters by name, ruled that the wearing of 
branded clothing by the presenters did not amount to product placement, 
as there was no evidence that it was worn in return for payment or any 
other consideration.

But
it said that 'the wearing of the same visibly branded clothing by two 
of the programme's presenters in the two editions of the programme did 
amount to undue prominence....which gave the impression that the 
programmes were promoting or endorsing these products.'

The 'cumulative effect was that the branded clothing was unduly prominent' and breached guidelines covering product prominence.

The programmes were broadcast last November and December.

It is not the first time the BBC has been forced to defend itself over criticisms of product placement.

In 2008, MailOnline ran seven pictures of its correspondents out on location who were all sporting North Face jackets, including the then economics editor Evan Davis, who now presents the Today Programme.

At the time, a BBC insider told us: 'There is no doubt these companies like having their brands shown on the news and occasionally I have heard of firms approaching a reporter and offering them a free jacket.

'I have heard this has happened with two people. Technically that's illegal because BBC reporters are not allowed to get any freebies.'
