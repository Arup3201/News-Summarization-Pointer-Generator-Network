It's little more than a week since the nation fell silent in a poignant mark of respect to Armed Forces personnel who have given their lives while serving their country.

But one former soldier carries a permanent reminder of the friends he lost while serving in the 4th Batallion The Rifles.

Paul Glazebrook has paid tribute to six of his fallen colleagues who died during tours of Afghanistan and Iraq by having each of their names tattooed across his back.

Tribute: Paul Glazebrook has had a tattoo with six of his fallen comrades names inked on his back

Ex-soldier Paul, of Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, served alongside 
Jez Brooks, Paul Harding, John Rigby, Rod Wilson, Edward Vakabua and Tom
Keogh and has had their names and the date of each of their deaths 
inked on dog tags on his back.

As well as the poignant reminder of his colleagues which surrounds a 
clasped pair of hands, Paul also has the poignant Ode to Remebrance 
taken from a poem by Laurence Binyan below his shoulder blades.

Among
the soldiers remembered on Paul's tattoo is John Rigby who died on his 
24th birthday in 2007 after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Basra.

He served alongside his twin brother Will who held his brother's hand for 10 hours in a field hospital after he was wounded.

John, from Rye, East Sussex, had been providing 'top cover' from the hatch of his armoured vehicle when the device exploded.

His brother bravely returned to serve on the front line.

Rod Wilson, 30, died when he was wounded in June 2007 in the Al Atyah district to the north west of Basra.

He was part of a crew that came under attack from small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades.

The soldier was mortally wounded when he stepped in to help an injured colleague and was hit himself.

Described as a much loved figure in the batallion, Jeremy 'Jez' Brooks died in May 2007.

He was killed when the patrol he was in was hit by a small arms fire attack. The 28-year-old was commanding a Bulldog Armoured Vehicle at the time.

Edward Vakabua, aged 23, from 4th Battalion The Rifles who died at the Basra Palace base

Fijjian soldier Edward Vakabua was tragically killed in Saddam Hussain's former palace in Basra, which had been transformed into a British forces headquarters, in June 2007.

He has been lauded as a hero shortly before he died after saving a fellow soldier's life.

He had been manning a vulnerable rooftop observation post when it was hit by insurgent mortar fire, seriously injuring a colleague.

The 23-year-old volunteered to face heavy mortar fire and drive the injured soldier to a helicopter landing site so that he could be evacuated to safety.

Tom Keogh was killed by a gunshot wound in March 2010 in Sangin, Afghanistan. Originally from Paddington, the soldier had signed up in 2003 originally and served until 2008, including a tour of Iraq. he left the Army but signed up again in 2009.

Following his death, his parents Lawrence and Marion keogh described him as bringing 'laughter and happiness to all who knew him.'

He was described as 'one of the best' by the regiment's commanding officer Lt Col Rupert Jones.

Major Paul Harding, 48, from Winchester, was killed by indirect fire at the Provincial Joint Co-ordination Centre in Basra in 2007.

He was described by colleagues as inspiring 'love, devotion and loyalty' among his fellow soldiers.
