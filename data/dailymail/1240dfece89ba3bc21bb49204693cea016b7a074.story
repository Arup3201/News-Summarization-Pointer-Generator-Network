Despite critics predicting misery, 45 per cent of benefit claimants whose income was cut has started looking for a job

Nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments are now doing more to find work, according to a poll.

Since the cap was introduced a year ago this month more than 38,600 households have had the amount they are paid in benefits limited to £26,000 a year – the income of the average working family.

Despite predictions by critics that the new rule would cause misery, the poll – conducted by Ipsos Mori – found that 45 per cent of those affected say they have been spurred to return to work.

The poll of more than 1,600 capped households revealed that 28 per cent of claimants sent off more job applications to find paid work and 27 per cent said they are using agencies such as Jobcentre Plus, careers centres and recruitment consultants more regularly to help them find work.

The research also revealed that while many people were already looking for work prior to being capped, 40 per cent of respondents said that they had been ‘more encouraged’ to find work as a result of the benefit cap.

Latest figures show that nearly 4,300 households that were previously subject to the benefit cap have found jobs since the limit was introduced in April 2013.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the figures as evidence that the benefit cap is working.

He told the Mail: ‘When we introduced the policy there was predictable scare mongering from Labour. They said the cap was unfair, and that it would lead to mass homelessness.

‘Yet again they denounced an eminently sensible and fair means of reducing the ballooning benefits bill and said we were destroying the welfare state.

‘Far from it. What Labour still fail to understand is that their reckless spendthrift ways put the whole system at risk because it was unsustainable.’

He added: ‘By capping benefits we send
 a clear message: the only way to increase the amount of money you 
receive is through work. The system we inherited from Labour had become a
 trap.

‘By allowing those on benefits to receive more than the average household earns it made choosing a life on benefits too easy.

‘It sent the wrong message to benefit claimants as well as to the taxpayer who was footing the bill.’

Capping benefits will save the Government around £185million a year for the next four years, but Mr Duncan Smith said the policy is about changing the behaviour of claimants as well as saving money.

‘That’s why what I find most encouraging about today’s findings is that people are recognising that the way to raise their income is by finding a job,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

‘Significant numbers of people are moving off benefits and into work, and those that haven’t found work say that they are more likely to look for work.

‘People are recognising that the way to raise their income is by finding a job. This is clear evidence that the benefit cap, along with so many of our reforms, is changing people’s behaviour and people’s lives for the better.

‘These findings should make critics of the cap think twice.’

More than 38,600 households have been affected by the cap, according to the most recent figures. Of those currently capped, more than 300 households had more than £300 a week capped from their income.

Benefits for couples and lone parents have been capped at £500 per week, or £350 for a single. childless person.
