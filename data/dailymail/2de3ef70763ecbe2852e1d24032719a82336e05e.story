The four people who allegedly pelted rocks at police officers and abused paramedics when they tried to save a teenage man after he was struck by a train, have been charged.

Adrian Simon was celebrating his birthday with family and friends when he fell asleep on the tracks at a railway crossing near Taree, on the north coast of New South Wales on December 21.

Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive after reports that an 18-year-old was hit by a train around 4.30am and had both his legs severed.

Simon was taken to John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition but died three days later on Christmas Eve.
