More than 130 passengers who suffered severe diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramps on board nine separate trips have won a £280,000 settlement from the cruise operator.

The passengers all fell ill while travelling aboard the Fred Olsen cruise liner, the Boudicca, on nine trips between October 2009 and May 2010.

A spokesman for travel law specialists Irwin Mitchell, who handled the case on behalf of the passengers, said the cruise operator has agreed to settle the case without formally admitting liability for causing the passengers to fall ill. 

The cruise operator said the illness were down to a higher than usual number of cases of norovirus or winter vomiting virus among the UK population.

Luke and Emma Ryan from Petersfield in Hampshire booked a Christmas and New Year break on board the ship, with their five-year-old daughter Abigail.

But Mr Ryan, 41, said their long-anticipated holiday soon turned into a nightmare.

He said: 'It was a disaster. This was supposed to be a relaxing time for us to celebrate the festive period, so we couldn't believe it when I fell ill on Christmas Eve with nausea, stomach cramps and gastric symptoms.

'Instead of opening presents on Christmas morning, I had to be seen by a nurse.

'The
 cruise was cut short by a day due to the illness and, to be frank, the 
end could not have come soon enough. We hope this settlement will mean 
we can now move on with our lives.'

Clare Pearson, specialist illness lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The fact that some of the passengers who suffered illness during and after trips on the Boudicca cruise ship in 2009 and 2010 still have continuing symptoms demonstrates the seriousness of what they have been through.

'Through our work, we have heard a range
 of stories of how so many people’s breaks - which were often booked as 
luxury once-in-a-lifetime trips to celebrate Christmas, wedding 
anniversaries and birthdays - were ruined by illness.

We are delighted for our clients that they have now received a fair settlement from Fred Olsen after enduring such terrible times on board the Boudicca.

'We hope that this outcome will allow our clients to look to the future and put the terrible problems they faced behind them, while we hope that it also acts as a reminder to cruise operators of the need to uphold the highest standards of safety and hygiene on board their ships.'

A Fred Olsen spokeswoman said their clients 'may rest assured' that all their ships 'meet the highest standards of health, safety and hygiene at all times'.

She said their fleet comply 'fully with the strict requirements and inspections of their flag state and relevant authorities'.

The passengers fell ill on nine separate cruises between October 2009 and May 2010. The cruise operator settled but refused to admit liability for the illness, putting it down to an outbreak of norovirus in the UK

'Fred Olsen Cruise Lines rejects any allegations made in the claim by Irwin Mitchell solicitors - as it has all along - regarding the standards of cleanliness and hygiene aboard its ships, which are of the highest standard across its fleet,' the spokeswoman said.

'In particular, Fred Olsen ensures that it upholds the most rigorous hygiene standards when preparing and serving food on board its ships, and refutes any allegations made by Irwin Mitchell to the contrary.

'Unfortunately, from October 2009 to May 2010, there was a higher incidence than usual of gastric illness, also known as ‘norovirus’, or ‘winter vomiting virus’, within communities in the United Kingdom, which is commonly identifiable in areas where people reside in close proximity.

'Most people do not report incidences, but on a cruise ship - where movement is restricted - cases are particularly highlighted.

'The virus - which is more contagious than the common cold, and is spread very easily by contact with surfaces and from person to person - is also particularly prevalent during periods of cold weather.

'Symptoms of the illness include a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea; some people may have a temperature, headache and stomach cramps. Commonly, the illness abates within one or two days.

'It is frustrating that, even with 
the extra preventative and containment measures that were put in place, a
 number of guests on board these cruises were affected by this illness.'

The
 firm said all passnegers on board their cruises are made aware of the 
importance of meticulous hygiene, are asked to complete a medical 
questionnaire before embarking on their holiday and are reminded 
regularly to make use of the hand sanitiser provided on board.

In the event of an outbreak of gastric illness, the spokeswoman said the crews take every precaution to ensure the 'swift containment of the illness on board', resulting in the closure of a number of public areas, including all public toilets and the self-service buffet.

She said frequent cleaning is undertaken and any guest showing signs of the illness are asked to stay in their cabin, with complimentary room service and entertainment, until they are considered to be symptom-free by the ship's doctor.

'At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of all our guests and crew remains our utmost priority at all times, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry,' the spokeswoman added.

Monica Bounds was on board the Fred Olsen liner Boudicca when she was struck down by norovirus.

She said her £900 getaway turned into a holiday from hell.

Mrs Bounds branded the luxury liner a 'plague ship', riddled with the illness, which left numerous passengers 'quaratined' in cabins as crew wore masks and nuclear disaster-style suits.

Fred Olsen said 61 of 732 passengers became ill on the voyage.

Mrs Bounds spent much of her ten-day cruise isolated in her cabin, where her seriously ill friend Veronica Godfrey was on two drips hooked over a coathanger and hanging from a porthole.

A spokesman for the cruise operator, said, at the time: 'Boudicca underwent an extensive "deep clean" and sanitising operation by independent specialist contractors before she embarked.

'It was extremley disappointing that, following these rigourous measures, the virus was brought back on the ship.'February 2013A Carnival cruise ship was stranded in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine fire broke out and crippled the power system.
