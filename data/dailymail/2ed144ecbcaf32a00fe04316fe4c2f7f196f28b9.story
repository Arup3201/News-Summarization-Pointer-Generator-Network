Tottenham are showing an interest in Feyenoord winger Jean-Paul Boetius.

Spurs are having major difficulty in shifting some of their deadwood out of the club this month, a struggle that is restricting Mauricio Pochettino's attempts to sign new players.

It is hoped the departure of Kyle Naughton to Swansea will trigger the start of a number of deals in and out of Spurs before the transfer deadline.

And Dutch forward Boetius, 20, is a player interesting the North London club.

The Holland international, who was called up into Louis van Gaal's preliminary squad for last summer's World Cup, has been watched regularly by Spurs scouts this season.

And Tottenham are ready to intensify their interest with a move for the youngster this month.

Arsenal will resist any offers for Nacho Monreal this month after Atletico Bilbao enquired about the defender.

The La Liga club have shown an interest in the Gunners' versatile defender, but were told he will not be leaving the Emirates Stadium.

Monreal has been an important figure for Arsene Wenger's side this season, playing regularly at central defence and left-back for the injury hit Gunners.

Bilbao may return for Monreal in the summer when they'll have a better chance of nabbing the Spaniard.

Swansea have joined the race to land Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M’Vila.

Queens Park Rangers are also tracking the Frenchman, but will struggle to get a loan deal over the line due to their lack of finances.

M'Vila, who was once a target for Arsenal, is currently on loan at Inter Milan - but the Italians are willing to cut the deal short.

Swans boss Garry Monk has cash to spend following the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for £28million.

Crystal Palace are set to revisit their interest in Lille left-back Pape Souare as their move for Neil Taylor continues to drag on.

Souare was a target for the club prior to Neil Warnock's sacking, but the Eagles have since switched their attentions to Swansea's Taylor.

But Palace are struggling to agree a fee for the Wales international, already having a £4.5million offer rejected.

And Alan Pardew is considering turning to Souare in his attempts to land a new left-back.

West Brom are set to make a fresh offer for Nottingham Forest forward Michail Antonio.

The Championship club have already knocked back an initial attempt from Tony Pulis to snare the 24-year-old winger.

But the Baggies are preparing a second offer to sign the winger this month.

Pulis is finding difficulty in landing his first choice wing option Callum McManaman from Wigan and is exploring alternatives.

Queens Park Rangers' Matt Phillips, a player who has been scouted by Pulis in the past, is another option for WBA.

Ben Watson has returned to London after signing for Championship side Watford from Wigan.

The midfielder's transfer signals a move back to the city Watson grew up in, beginning his career at Crystal Palace.

He is eligible to line up for the Hornets in Saturday's clash against Blackpool, and will provide solid Championship experience in Slavisa Jokanovic's side.

He enjoyed six years at the DW Stadium, from 2009 to 2015, most notably scoring the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City at Wembley.

Serie A side Torino are interested in tying up a move for QPR outcast Adel Taarabt.

Managed by Giampiero Ventura, Torino lie mid-table in the Italian top division, and would like to bring Taarabt back to Italy after a short loan stint at AC Milan last season.

Taarabt was blasted by QPR boss Harry Redknapp for being overweight, and has struggled to make an impact at Loftus Road in the last couple of seasons.

Bolton want Cardiff striker Adam Le Fondre and have opened talks over a loan with a view to a £1.5m deal.

Huddersfield were also interested in the 28-year-old, but it appears that Neil Lennon's side are the frontrunners for his signature.

Le Fondre signed for Cardiff in May 2014 but has not hit it off in south Wales, scoring just three times in 23 Championship appearances.
