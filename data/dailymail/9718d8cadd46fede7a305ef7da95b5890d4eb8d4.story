He had his hand and part of his arm torn off but that didn't stop shark attack survivor Sean Pollard giving his footy mates an inspiring speech from his hospital bed ahead of their grand final match.

The Bunbury man was due to play for his South Bunbury Football Club on Sunday but he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay at Kelpids Beach, about 6km east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday morning.

While his team mates huddled around a mobile phone in the change rooms to hear Mr Pollard speak before taking on Carey Park at Hands Oval in South Bunbury, the club also read inspiring letters from witnesses who helped rescue the surfer after the attack.

The 23-year-old had his second operation at Royal Perth Hospital on Sunday night and is in a stable condition but hopes to be able to stand soon and give his family a group hug, his family says.

Mr Pollard swam back to shore after being attacked and was pulled from the water by Peter Rothnie and Dean Gaebler before the pair, along with nearby beach goers helped assist him.

‘I have never seen a more courageous human being and probably never will," Mr Rothnie wrote in the letter to the team, according to The West Australian. 

‘His desire to live another day, his desire to see (girlfriend) Claire, his family and friends and, dare I say it, his footy mates was above and beyond comprehension.

‘The amount of determination Sean had to get himself to safety and then the determination he showed to keep calm was simply nothing short of miraculous.’

Mr Pollard's uncle, Kim Fergusson, issued a statement on behalf of the family on Monday, thanking the rescuers and crediting them with saving his life.

He said Mr Pollard's partner and the family had remained by his side since the ordeal.

‘Sean has said his first goal is to stand and receive a group hug from his family, such is the character of this remarkable young man,’ Mr Fergusson said.

He said Mr Pollard's traumatic injuries were being closely monitored by doctors at the hospital with the recovery plan from each procedure requiring the intervention of many medical professionals.

‘What is aiding Sean's recovery is his physical fitness, as a result of his healthy lifestyle and active sporting interests,’ Mr Fergusson said.

‘However, his injuries are severe so there will be a long road ahead.’

Mr Fergusson said the family had been overwhelmed with offers of support from the public, which he described as very comforting.

Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA Shark Cull campaign, has also launched an Indiegogo fundraiser for Mr Pollard, so far raising more than $6000.

Collection tins remain at the Esperance Shire's administration and leisure centres and hundreds of dollars were raised through the grand final to help fund his long road to recovery.

The state's Fisheries Department responded to the attack by catching and killing two young female white sharks on drumlines - the first time the protected species had been killed by WA officials.

An examination of Mr Pollard's surfboard indicated a white shark was responsible. But scientists could not determine if either of the caught sharks had attacked the victim because they often disgorged stomach contents.

Mr Pollard had reportedly claimed to have been attacked by two bronze whalers but Fisheries said white sharks sometimes had a bronze discolouration.
