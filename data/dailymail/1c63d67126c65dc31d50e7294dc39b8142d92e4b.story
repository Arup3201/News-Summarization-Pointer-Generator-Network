A terrified 14-year-old girl has happened upon the body of her dead mother who was killed by her stepfather in a murder-suicide case in Phoenix this week.

The incident occurred at a luxury home inside a gated community north of the city on Tuesday.

The deceased, Jennifer and Blaine Palmer, both 52, were only divorced on Monday.

The teenager had returned home from school about 4pm when she discovered the body of her stepfather in a bedroom with a gun nearby.

Tragic: The victim has been identified as Jennifer Palmer, whose daughter found the bodies about 4pm. The suspect has been identified as Blaine Palmer, who was found dead in the bedroom with a gun nearby

'She was backing out of the home not knowing what was wrong and discovered her mother shot in the garage,' Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump told CBS 5.

The body of Jennifer Palmer was found shot to death in the drivers seat of a car that had multiple bullet holes in it.

Neighbors told police that they heard gunshots around 7.30am, leading police to believe the murder-suicide occurred in the morning.

A suicide note was also found inside the home.

The gated community is located near 67th Avenue and Jomax Road in Phoenix.

Neighbors described the couple as 'good people'. 

Sgt. Trump said that Blaine Palmer was expected to move out of the home within a few days.

The 14-year-old is now in the care of her biological father.
