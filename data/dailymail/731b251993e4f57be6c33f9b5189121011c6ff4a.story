World Cup cast-off Ben Stokes gave England's selectors a reminder of his talents with a big-hitting half-century on his Big Bash debut for Melbourne Renegades.

Stokes, left out of England's final 15 for the impending global tournament in Australia and New Zealand after an unproductive 2014, could still be a late inclusion as a replacement should injury befall any squad member.

Arriving only as an injury replacement too for the Renegades, following Jesse Ryder's defection, the 23-year-old wasted no time confirming his liking for Australian conditions.

Stokes (77), the one shining light of England's miserable Ashes tour last winter, smashed eight fours and five sixes from just 37 balls in the Renegades' much-needed 37-run win over Hobart Hurricanes at the Bellerive Oval.

Former England captains Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen were predictably on cue with their views on Twitter.

Vaughan wrote: 'When I watch @benstokes38 I can only think England haven't quite got it right with him yet ... Huge talent ...

'Just a reminder @benstokes38 was the only England player to stand up in Australia last winter ... He likes the conditions ...'

Pietersen, also left out of England's plans after his sacking 11 months ago, was another to remind the selectors of his talents this week with a Big Bash half-century.

He tweeted: '@benstokes38 is a star in the making. He's showing it this eve! Good on him! I cannot for the life of me believe he's not in WC.' 

Stokes, who was left out of England's 15-man squad for the tri-series and World Cup, hits another big one

Stokes was a near ever-present, when fit, for England last year but mustered a limited-overs output of only 200 runs and 14 wickets in 17 matches across the two formats.

After his continued poor form in the one-day international series defeat in Sri Lanka, he ended that tour out of the team and was then not chosen shortly afterwards in England's World Cup squad.

There was no cheer for England, who arrive in Australia on Wednesday in time their pre-World Cup tri-series, when Alex Hales - in his last Big Bash appearance before joining up with them - could make only seven as the Hurricanes faltered to 126 all out in reply to 163 for seven.
