The Secret Service has arrested a man for tossing firecrackers over a fence at the White House just hours after a gunman went on a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard.

An Associated Press photographer and passersby heard what sounded like two gunshots outside the White House just after 3:30pm.

Moments later, three uniformed Secret Service officers arrested a middle-aged man on Pennsylvania Avenue, wrestling him to the ground.Â

High alert: The strange act came just hours after a gunman went on a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard

The man was white, with dark hair, wearing a blue shirt and white shorts. His white shoes lay on the ground near where the officer tackled him.

The incident happened at 3:39pm, just hours after at least one suspect opened fire inside the Washington Navy Yard, killing at least 12 people. The gunman, Aaron Alexis, was also killed.

A woman who witnessed the arrest, Rachel Jackson, tweeted a picture with the comment: 'Just witnessed something outside the white house, two firecracker sounds. Police tackled the guy, who was by himself.'

Shoes: He lost his shoes int he scuffle

The nation's capital was on high alert after Alexis opened fire at the Navy Yard just after 8am.

Eyewitnesses described the chaotic scenes and how a gunman walked calmly into the facility and silently sprayed bullets from an AR-15 assault rifle.

'No words. He raised the gun and started firing. He said nothing,' witness Todd Brundidge said.

Shots were fired at the Naval Yard at 8.20am. Police said 13 people had been killed, including the 34-year-old gunman. They initially thought another suspect could still be at large, though it is now believed he acted alone.
