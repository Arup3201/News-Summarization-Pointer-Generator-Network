The man behind the anti-Muslim video that has incited violence against the U.S. across the Middle East emerged from hiding on Wednesday to appear in court in Los Angeles to deny he had violated his probation for a previous check fraud conviction.

The Egyptian born filmmaker, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, fled his California home on September 11, in the aftermath of the release of his controversial video that has sparked violent protests abroad.

He denied in court that he committed eight probation violations, 
including lying to officials over the scope his role in the film and 
using aliases.

The California man has been in a federal 
detention center since Sept. 28 after he was arrested for eight 
probation violations and deemed a flight risk by another judge. 
Prosecutors said he lied to his probation officers about his real 
name and used aliases.

A crudely made 13-minute video attributed to the man, who appeared in court on Wednesday under the name Mark Basseley Youssef, was filmed in California and circulated online under several titles including 'Innocence of Muslims.'

It portrays the Prophet Mohammad as a fool and a sexual deviant, and sparked a torrent of anti-American unrest in Arab and Muslim countries last month. The violence coincided with a separate attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.

As outrage against the film mounted, U.S. authorities said they were not investigating the film itself.

'My client was not the cause of the violence in the Middle East,' attorney Steven Seiden said after Wednesday's hearing. 'Clearly, it was pre-planned and it was just an excuse and a trigger point to have more violence.'

But prosecutors have said they could seek to have Youssef, 55, sent back to prison for up to two years if he is found to have violated his probation on a bank fraud conviction.

Youssef, who was escorted to court by
 five U.S. Marshals, was ordered held without bail last month and has 
been staying at a high-rise federal jail in downtown Los Angeles.

Under the terms of his release from 
prison last year, Youssef was barred from using aliases without the 
permission of a probation officer and restricted from accessing the 
Internet. An evidentiary hearing in his probation case was set for 
November 9.

'It will be interesting to see what the 
judge does and what the reaction is around the world,' said Stan 
Goldman, a Loyola Law School professor.

Goldman said attorneys for Youssef could argue the terms of his 2011 
release from prison in the bank fraud case did not apply directly to his
 recent activities, in which people associated with the film have said 
he misrepresented himself.

'It's not exactly like an armed robber on probation, getting caught with
 an automatic weapon in his possession. It's a little more technical,' 
Goldman said.

The defendant, who had worked in the gas station industry and most 
recently lived in a suburb of Los Angeles, declared at the outset of his
 last hearing that he had changed his name to Mark Basseley Youssef in 
2002.

The probation issues were the latest of Youssef's legal woes. An actress
 who says she was duped into appearing in the anti-Islam film has sued 
him over the matter, identifying him as the film's producer. Cindy Lee 
Garcia also named YouTube and its parent company Google Inc as 
defendants in the case.

Google has refused to remove the film from YouTube, despite pressure 
from the White House and others to take it down, though the company has 
blocked the trailer in Egypt, Libya and other Muslim countries.
