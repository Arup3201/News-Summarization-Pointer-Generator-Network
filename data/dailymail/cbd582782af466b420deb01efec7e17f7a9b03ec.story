A suspected Islamic fundamentalist thought to have fought in Syria while on sabbatical from his job as an NHS doctor was in custody last night.

The man was arrested with his wife at Heathrow Airport on Monday after returning to Britain from Egypt.

Counter-terrorism officers suspect he was an AK-47 wielding medic among a gang of kidnappers in war-torn Syria.

The man is accused of being part of a
small British contingent among a 40-strong cell called Al Absi, which 
aims to convert Syria to sharia law.

The group occupied a camp inside the Syrian border and took two veteran war photographers hostage on July 19.

The fanatics accused the men of 
working for the CIA before handcuffing and blindfolding them after they 
were shot when they attempted to escape.

The two hostages – John Cantlie, who 
had worked for the Sunday Times, and Jeroen Oerlemans – eventually ran 
away a week later with the help of the Free Syrian Army.

On returning to Britain, Mr Cantlie 
said a doctor with a strong London accent used a saline drip and other 
equipment with NHS branding to treat a gunshot wound to his arm.

Mr Cantlie said the heavily-bearded 
AK-47-wielding medic, of Pakistani descent, claimed to have taken a 
sabbatical from his work in London to treat injured fighters in Syria.

He told the prisoners he wanted to 
wage ‘holy war’ and that his experiences on the frontline would serve as
good training for a career in treating trauma injuries.

The man, who said he had a wife and 
child in Britain and kept his face covered with sunglasses and a scarf, 
said he held a senior post at a South  London A&E department.

The photographers were told during 
their ordeal that two Syrians would be beheaded for spying but they were
eventually spared after repenting and promising to follow sharia law.

Mr Cantlie will now be asked if he recognises the man. 

He previously said there were up to 
15 British nationals at the terrorist camp where the men were held in 
northern Syria. On one occasion Mr Cantlie heard the doctor on the phone
to his family. ‘He was saying, “Hello babes, how’s the little ‘un? Put 
him on and let me hear him.”’

At another point, the man even complained to the hostages about the state of the NHS.

Mr Cantlie said: ‘I asked for his 
help as we were both from London but he refused to even send a text to 
my girlfriend to say we were alive. He said he would be beheaded if he 
did.

‘It wasn’t much fun expecting to end 
up on an execution video at the hands of extremists – one of whom was 
treating Londoners like me a few months ago.’

Arrests: The two 26-year-olds were arrested by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command at 8.30pm last night after arriving on a flight into Heathrow Airport

Last night Mr Cantlie, 41, told the 
Daily Mail he was aware of the arrests but that he could not comment due
to any potential on-going involvement.

A source close to the investigation 
said detectives have warned him he will soon be asked to view a video 
identification parade.

The suspected terrorist and his 
26-year-old wife were arrested after UK intelligence officers studied 
medical records and interviewed health sources to try and identify him.

Police are investigating whether the 
woman may have flown to Egypt to meet her husband as a ‘cover’ so they 
could pretend they had been on holiday when they returned at 8.30pm on 
Monday.

Officials believe that up to 100 British nationals have travelled to Syria to fight against Assad’s regime.

Analysts say the majority of people 
fighting the regime of President Bashar Assad are ordinary Syrians and 
soldiers who have defected. But an increasing number of foreign fighters
with militant Islamic beliefs from countries including Britain and 
France are crossing the borders.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Government is monitoring evidence of British people who want to join the conflict.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman 
confirmed the couple were arrested as part of an investigation into 
people travelling to Syria to commit terrorist acts.

He said two homes in East London were searched by officers following the arrests.
