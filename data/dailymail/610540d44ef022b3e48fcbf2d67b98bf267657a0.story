Brazilian heartthrob Neymar may have the facial hair of a post-diet Santa Claus, but he still appears to have no problem partying with the ladies - even when wearing a ridiculous cap backwards.

Pictured enjoying a night out in Florianopolis - 700km south of Sao Paulo, Brazil - the Barcelona forward was spotted catching up with his friends at a nightclub in Jurere.

The snapback-clad poster boy posed for photographs as he soaked up the party atmosphere at the night-time get-together.

And the superstar looked very relaxed during his winter break and Barcelona hope he will come back suitably refreshed in January. 

As Neymar frolicked, his Barcelona team-mate Andres Iniesta was thinking ahead to the work at hand, as they trail rivals Real Madrid at the peak of La Liga table.

'At the moment we're not even contemplating ending the year without winning any titles,' Iniesta told Spanish paper Marca. 'The squad we have has the quality to do it.

'The important thing is to believe in what we do, in how we do it, and keep improving to reach the team's maximum potential.

Ahead of January's Ballon d'Or ceremony, the 30-year-old was clear about who where his allegiances lie.

'I think we have the three best forwards. There is nothing negative to say when you're talking about Leo (Messi), 'Ney' (Neymar) and Luis (Suarez).'
