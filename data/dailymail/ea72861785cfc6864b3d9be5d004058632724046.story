The Premier League’s attempt to set up a European competition for Under 21 players has been blocked by UEFA.

Officials at the Premier League had 16 clubs across Europe ready to participate in the ‘International Cup’ and address a major concern recently highlighted by FA chairman Greg Dyke’s commission; a lack of meaningful, competitive football for players aged between 18 and 21. 

But after a lengthy consultation process with UEFA over the formation of the competition the Premier League have been left bitterly disappointed by the European governing body’s refusal to give it their approval. As one observer said, ‘it seems a bit small-minded of UEFA to block it’.

Sportsmail revealed the Premier League's plans for the competition last month 

An impressive group of clubs are ready to sign up to a competition that even had a proposed fixture schedule in place.

From England Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Fulham, Leicester City, Southampton, Sunderland and West Ham are on board. While from the rest of Europe Celtic, Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Schalke, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven and Villarreal are also ready to take part.

A Premier League source said: ‘The idea is to create a competition between like-minded clubs, who want to do something new for their players’ development.

‘Clubs, coaches and players are looking for this kind of international experience, at this vital transition phase in players’ careers. Friendlies are not the answer at this age, there needs to be a competitive edge.

'There isn't anything else like this so hopefully when UEFA’s position has been clarified, this can be sorted for the future.

'English football is working incredibly hard to produce more and better home-grown players and the European Under 21s is but one element. 

'The huge investment and innovation in player development clubs have committed to will provide the players that could get England to the semis or final of Euro 2020 as well as hosting them.’
