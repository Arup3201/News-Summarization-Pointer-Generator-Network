A father was left with a broken jaw after a man in a motorised wheelchair teamed up with a second man to attack him as he walked home from work.

Police are trying to trace the culprits who were captured on CCTV before they attacked Emmanuvel Camisan Judes.

Mr Judes was forced to spend his 31st birthday in hospital after the unprovoked attack which saw him left unconscious, lying in a pool of his blood, after he was shoved to the ground by the two men who had just left Cineworld nearby. 

Police have released CCTV images of the two men before the attack in an attempt to trace them.

Mr Judes, who has an 18-month-old daughter said he was waiting for a bus near the library in Garratt Lane at around 11pm after his supermarket shift when the older man asked him what he was looking at. 

When he said nothing the man drove the wheelchair into his legs and the second younger man shoved him into a wall. 

Mr Judes then blacked out as hit his head on the wall and fell to the pavement.

He told the Evening Standard: 'The other man pushed me really hard in the chest, my head hit the wall and I passed out. I have no idea what happened after that.

Officers hope to trace the two men, pictured with a woman (right) who was not involved in the assault 

'I think I may have been hit by something else like a stick, because I got a broken jaw as well. But I didn't see them carrying anything.'

Mr Judes moved from Sri Lanka to London three years ago and had to have a screw and metal plate inserted into his jaw.  

The men, who were with a woman who did not take part in the attack on July 25, then left in the direction of Wandsworth Road.

The man in the wheelchair was balding, aged 40 to 45, and the second man, who is aged 20 to 25 and was wearing a black t-shirt and a red baseball cap.

Detective Constable Chris Taylor said: 'This attack was completely unprovoked. The victim had just finished the late shift at a local supermarket and was on his way home.

Anyone with information is asked to contact  Wandsworth CID on 020 3276 2582 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
