A grandmother was told Christmas decorations outside her home should be taken down because housing bosses feared they were a health and safety risk.

Sharon Antell has been putting up lights - including an inflatable Santa and snowman - outside her home in Neath, south Wales for 20 years.

She was even more determined to make the area look festive this year after a nearby public display of Christmas lights was axed.

Sharon Antell was told she should not put up the traditional Christmas display on the porch of her home in Neath, south Wales because of fears she might fall. Her landlords have now backed down and agreed she can leave the inflatable snowman and Santa in place over the festive season

But she was left stunned this year when she received a letter from her landlords telling her they breached health and safety regulations.

Coastal Housing Association said they feared the 50-year-old could fall while putting them up and threatened to take them down before Christmas.

The letter she received from the housing association stated: 'Following the recent site visit to look at the Christmas decorations it has been decided that they must be removed from the porch roof.

'This decision has been made on health and safety grounds. We cannot allow residents access to the roof via the communal window and trailing extension leads through the communal areas.

'I understand you have gone through the expense of purchasing the decoration but permission should have been asked before putting them up.

Landlords insist Mrs Antell must allow them to remove the display of Santa and a snowman from her porch

'I would ask that you do not go back out on the roof and we'll arrange an appointment with you to bring in the decorations. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact the office.'

After the edict caused outrage among locals, the company have now agreed to leave the display in place over the festive season.

But they are still insisting Mrs Antell allow their workers to come and remove the decorations in the New Year.

Mrs Antell, a mother of eight and grandmother of 16, said: 'I have been doing this for the last 20 years and I've never had an accident. I think it is disgusting - Christmas only happens once a year.

'I told the council I would take full responsibility for myself if an accident did happen but that's not enough for them.

'People are always telling me how festive it looks. The children and grandchildren love seeing Santa in lights.

'But I had a letter through this week telling me I'm not allowed to do it and that they would send someone out to take them down.

'They said it's for health and safety reasons. I couldn't believe it.'

Coastal Housing Association confirmed they were concerned about the display, but have since agreed to leave them up.

A spokesman said: 'The roof is about 12ft off the ground and only accessible by a window.

'The safety of tenants was of paramount importance and we were concerned that she may fall.

'In this instance, we would have been happy to help Ms Antell put up the Christmas decorations.

'The decorations can remain as long as she agrees not to go back out onto the roof again. When Christmas is over so we can take the decorations down ourselves.'

The government ordered a purge on health and safety Scrooges who ruin the spirit of Christmas three years ago.

They released a list of false 'Christmas elf and safety' edicts wrongly used to ban festive fun.

The ten-point list of 'ridiculous' Christmas safety bans, compiled by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), included:-

- Children banned by teachers from having snowball fights in case injured pupils seek compensation.

The government announced a crackdown on festive season red tape and said snowball fights are safe

- Homeowners and businessmen being sued for clearing the snow outside their properties by passers-by who had slipped over. 

-Panto performers ordered not to throw sweets into the audience for fear of injuring them;

 -Santa's sleigh outlawed for posing a traffic risk.

Father Christmas was banned from riding his sleigh through Alnwick, Northumberland, after council officials said their insurance would not cover it. 

Other Santas have been ordered to wear high visibility vests over their traditional red robes.

Tory Chris Grayling said at the time of the announcement: 'We're determined to stamp out the health and safety kill-joys who try to bring the spirit of Scrooge to Christmas events.'
