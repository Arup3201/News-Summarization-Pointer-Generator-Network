Thousands of people have flocked to a Mexican city where crop circles spanning seven-hectares appeared on Christmas Eve.

Residents of Texcoco, some 15 miles from Mexico City, reportedly saw bright lights on Thursday night and the following morning spotted the patterns in the barley field.

According to a local newspaper, police received an anonymous call from a woman claiming to have seen 'the presence of aliens in farming areas and various figures in the crops'.

More skeptical locals blame heavy wind and other played down claims that chupacabras, or 'goat suckers', legendary animals sucker, are not involved. 

Crop circles are often associated with claims of alien contact, but scientists have proposed that they are either man made, or have appeared as a result of natural events.
