Anonymous has published the names of men who allegedly gang-raped a cheerleader at a party 12 years ago - after she turned to the hacking group for help following the Steubenville case.

Amanda Stevenson, 26, contacted the group after returning to Laurelville, Ohio, where she was raped when she was 14, with the intention of gathering evidence from her case - and discovering the sheriff's department no longer had it.

Fearing that authorities in the close-knit community were failing to help her chase her alleged attackers, she contacted Anonymous after reading that they had helped bring the Steubenville case to national attention.

That case, in which two students were 
prosecuted in a close-knit Ohio community after Anonymous leaked videos and photographs of the attack, 
was similar to her own, she said.

Now with the help of Anonymous, police have re-opened the case. But she told MailOnline that, due to problems working with authorities in Laurelville, she is uncertain if she will ever see a conviction.

'I do not think there is a chance I will see any of those guys convicted,' she said. 'There isn't evidence because it's been discarded or destroyed. But I'm coming forward because this is about authorities being held accountable.'

Stevenson
 said that the horrific attack unfolded as she attended her first high 
school party at a remote hunting cabin with her boyfriend when she was a
 high school freshman. When her boyfriend wanted to leave, she decided 
to stay and agreed to get a ride back with someone else.

When
 he left, someone handed her a Mountain Dew drink and after drinking it,
 she told Mother Jones that her limbs began to go limp and she lost the ability to talk.

She
 said she remembers being locked inside a room with five boys before 
they began passing her around, grabbing her. She said three raped her - 
while she could do nothing to stop them.

After one of the boys drove her home 
the next morning, she told her parents about the attack and they took 
her to the local hospital where she took a rape test.

Strong: She said she is still haunted by the rape but said she was unable to deal with the investigation as a teen

Records show the hospital contacted
 the Hocking County Sheriff's Department. She said she was too scared at
 the time to tell authorities the names of her alleged attackers.

When
 she returned to school, rumors began that she had made up the rape 
story so that people did not call her a slut for having sex with the 
boys, and when deputies started interviewing students, she said she 
received threats. Eventually she moved to Virginia to live with her 
father.

Hacking group Anonymous played a central role in the Steubenville rape case. Two football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik
 Richmond, 16, were convicted of the rape in March. They were sentenced to a 
minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with a maximum 
stay until they are 21.

The case emerged after Steubenville football players made fun of the 16-year-old victim, who was passed around and raped in August 2012, by spreading videos and pictures of her.

An Anonymous hacker, known as KYAnonymous and now revealed as security consultant Deric Lostutter, 26, was responsible for publicizing these videos and images. They inspired greater public interest in the case.

In December, hackers with Anonymous and 
KnightSec posted a video on a fan site for the Steubenville football team, threatening to release personal 
information of those involved in the Steubenville rape case if they did 
not come forward and apologize.

The FBI is now investigating Lostutter for his role.
 In a bizarre twist, if convicted of any hacking-related crimes, 
Lostutter faces up to 10 years in federal prison - nine more years than 
the minimum sentence for the convicted Steubenville rapists.

In April, Anonymous vowed to expose the identities of four boys who raped a 17-year-old girl who subsequently killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault.

The hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed culprits were and that they were confirming the identity of a third before putting them on the Internet.

In a post the group added that it was ‘only a matter’ of time before they got the fourth as well.

Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, hanged herself in her family's bathroom in Novia Scotia, Canada, two months ago after being relentlessly tormented.

She said the sheriff's department 
eventually dropped the case, saying they did not know where the assault 
had taken place and did not have any names for alleged attackers.

When Stevenson read the story about the
 rape in Steubenville, in which an incapacitated 16-year-old girl was 
passed around athletes in August 2012, she said she saw similarities with her own case.

When she contacted CNN about running 
her story in the wake of Steubenville, a journalist encouraged her to 
gather as much of the evidence from her case as she could.

She returned to the hospital and 
collected her medical records, which noted she had been the victim of a 
sexual assault and had been referred to Hocking County Sheriff's 
Department.

But when she went to the department, 
they had no record of her investigation and no longer had the clothes 
she had been wearing the night of the attack, she said.

She also discovered that her rape kit
 was no longer stored and she was eventually told it had been destroyed in 
an 'act of vandalism' when a fridge had been knocked over, she said.

She said she also learned deputies had compiled a list containing 'six or seven' names during their initial investigation.

When asked why authorities would fail to help her, Stevenson said: 'I've 
asked myself that. It's a stereotypical Midwest, Ohio town. Football 
rules, wrestling rules. They were wrestling stars and with that comes 
entitlement.'

She added that while it is one thing 
that the case was mishandled in the past, it is another that she believes the case 
continues to be mishandled.

'In my mind it's in your interest to find what the problems are [with your law enforcement],' she said.

'You can be an example of a small 
town that has recognized its errors and taken a strong stance to change 
it - because you respect your mothers and your sisters and your 
daughters.'

The couple decided to make a plea on the private page of Operation
 Abuse Awareness, an Anonymous-affiliated website set up after 
Steubenville. They included names and contacts of her attackers.

Within hours, they started talking to
 a member with the screen name Jonathan Perez, who then re-posted the 
information to his public website.

While the couple were shocked he had published this sensitive information, they were overjoyed when Hocking County detective Caleb Moritz contacted Perez on Facebook

'I would like to speak to you, or the 
person with the new information, so that we might further investigate 
the case and bring the perpetrator(s) to justice,' the detective said.

A week later, Moritz traveled to Virginia to interview Stevenson and let her know that the department had reopened her case.

But Moritz was worried about Perez's 
website and feared the alleged attackers could read the information and 
use it to craft an alibi. When the couple contacted Perez, he said 
he had forgotten the password to remove the information.

Authorities told Mother Jones that 
there were problems with the case - thanks to this public information 
and because of the lack of kept evidence.

'We don't want to jeopardize an investigation,' Hocking County Chief Deputy David Valkinburgtold said. 'But she's called some people before we even had a chance to interview any suspects.'

The department failed to return a request from MailOnline seeking comment.

Stevenson has also received help from
 the Attorney General's office but when representatives went to the 
sheriff's department to offer assistance, it was declined, she said.

Refusing to give up, she contacted 
her congressman and the sheriff has now accepted the Attorney General's help, Stevenson said.

'That was a huge victory at the time,' she said. 'Now we get our case investigated by someone who is independent of the county.'

Hackers: Help from Anonymous has had mixed results but police have now re-opened the case

Stevenson said she now hopes to work with legislatures to improve objective investigations for the victims of sexual abuse.

She accepts she might not get 
the justice she craves because of the lack of evidence. But she hopes to
 add to the pressure on law enforcement to take rape cases seriously.

She said she was not equipped to 
deal with the attack when she was so young, but now she is willing to fight as hard as she can for justice.

'I am more stable 
and can revisit it without it crippling me,' she said.
