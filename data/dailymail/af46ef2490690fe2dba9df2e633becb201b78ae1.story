A female DJ was left with facial injuries after she was dragged to the floor and kicked repeatedly in the face at a nightclub. 

Nakia Oliver was out with her sister and cousins at Avici White in Deansgate in Manchester on New Year's Day when she was attacked on the dancefloor.

Miss Oliver was left with a suspected broken nose and cuts and swelling to her face after the attack and claims she was repeatedly kicked as she lay unconscious.

She said she believes she could have been killed in the attack and nobody from the club came to help her.  

The 23-year-old said the trouble started when she 'brushed past' a woman with her bag to go for a dance and the woman shoved her. 

Her cousin tried to intervene and was punched in the face. 

Miss Oliver, of Whalley Range,  claims she stepped in to protect her and she too was hit.  

Miss Oliver claims she could have been killed after the attack at the club in the early hours of January 2 

She claims a man who was with the woman then dragged her to the floor, knocking her out, then continued to attack her as she lay unconscious.

'I've been told he was really laying into me. I remember being kicked but that's all I remember,'

'It's the lowest of the low. It could have been a lot worse, I could have been killed.'

Miss Oliver claims there were no bouncers in sight and nobody from the club came to her aid except a promoter who had booked her to DJ in the courtyard that night, before the outdoor sets were called off due to the weather.

'My sister helped me outside and we were just left on our own,' she said.

'I was crying hysterically, shocked and angry. I just didn't understand. No one really seemed to care. Because I've worked for them I thought at least someone should have helped me or protected me.

'It's left me quite anxious and it's made me scared to go out and do another gig. I'll never set foot in that club again.'

The attack took place between 4am and 4.30am on January 2. 

Her attacker is described only as a black male, in his early 20s, who was wearing a dark-coloured body warmer and a beanie hat. 

The woman who pushed her is described as mixed race or black, with medium length, ginger-coloured straight hair.

Police confirmed they were called to reports of an assault at the club at 4.35am and said enquiries were ongoing.

Club manager Richard Stevens refuted Nakia's claims against the venue and said door staff did as much as they could to help her.

He told Manchester Evening News: 'There were five door staff there and they were at the incident as soon as it happened and I personally came out of the office to see to the girl with the bust nose.'

Mr Stevens said they turned the music off and shut the venue immediately after the attack because they could not identify the perpetrator.
