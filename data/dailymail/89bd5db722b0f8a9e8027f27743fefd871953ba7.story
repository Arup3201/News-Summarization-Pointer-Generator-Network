17-year-old Lucy will take on her 37-year-old trainer Paul Ashe later this month

When Lucy Garland first told her parents she wanted try out wrestling, they didn't think she was serious.

But now the petite blonde, at only 5ft 5ins tall, takes on men in the ring who are more than twice her age and size.

The 17-year-old started training at the Ultimate British Wrestling (UBW) club in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, just one year ago but has already progressed to a competitive level.

Lucy, who has gained a reputation for her high-energy moves, will take on her 37-year-old trainer, Paul Ashe, in the ring during her first live match later this month (July 19).

With her long blonde curly hair, small frame and studying production art and costume design at Btec level, Lucy is not your typical wrestler.

She says that people are always shocked to hear about her double life in the fighting ring.

'People are always quite surprised when I tell them I'm a wrestler,' she says.

'My parents didn't think I would stick at it as I was the only girl at the club, but now they are very supportive and really proud.'

Although Lucy has only been training for a year, her interest spans back over eight years, when she first became engrossed in the subject after watching a wrestling match on TV at the age of nine.

'I was flicking through the TV channels and came across World Wrestling Entertainment and really enjoyed it,' Lucy says.

However, she had to wait until the age of 16 before she could join the club - and found it to be an intimating experience.

'It was 
scary at first as it is seen as a man's sport and I was the only female 
at the club,' she says.

'But I soon got 
to know everyone and absolutely loved it. Wrestling has given me so much 
more confidence, I don't know what I would have been like if I hadn't 
done it.'

Lucy says she is devoted to her craft, and trains once a week, working out at the gym six days a week and sticking to a strict diet in order to keep up with professional standards.

'I need to keep fit and also look physically good in the ring. Wrestling is as much about putting on a show as fighting,' she adds.

Lucy wants to take a gap year after college and go travelling, but before that she has to tackle her fight with her trainer Paul this month.

'I'm nervous as it's my first match, but I hope I will win. A year ago I would never have expected to be able to fight against Paul,' she says.

Lucy, whose mum Pauline is a teaching assistant and dad Richard is a postman, is the only wrestler in her family, says that being small has its advantages in the sport.

'Wrestling can be scary and I think you need dedication and a passion for it if you are going to succeed. I absolutely love it.'

'As I'm smaller than a lot of my opponents I tend to rely on my speed,' she said.

Justin Feller, a manager at UBW, said that the club are really pleased with Lucy's efforts.

'The management team at UBW are thrilled with the progress and dedication demonstrated by Lucy since she started training with us in 2013.

'We expect big things from her in the future and her age definitely gives her a great head start.'

Lucy will be battling against trainer Paul at North Hertfordshire College's Hitchin Centre for Arts on July 19.
