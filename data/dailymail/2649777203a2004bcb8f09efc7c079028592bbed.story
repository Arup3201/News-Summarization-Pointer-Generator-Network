Jailed: Ruth Nabuguzi was the ringleader of a 'family firm' that carried out a £4million benefits scam

A judge accused a family of African 
fraudsters of an ‘outrageous abuse of the hospitality’ shown to them by 
Britain as they were jailed yesterday for stealing £4million from 
taxpayers.

The 20-year scam included one of the 
fraud ringleaders creating fake identities for up to 100 children to 
milk the benefits system.

Ruth Nagubuzi also claimed to have HIV
 and Aids in order to receive costly drugs which she then sent back to 
Uganda for huge profits.

It was estimated that supplying the 
medicines to the 49-year-old, as well as four other made-up ‘sufferers’,
 cost the taxpayer more than £2million.

A further £154,000 went on education for members of the ‘family’, with £37,500 for a single higher education course.

Fraud relating to accommodation costs 
and sub-letting of flats by Nagubuzi cost £650,000, and the family’s 
benefits including child allowances, disability benefits, and council 
tax and tax credits totalled £900,000.

The gang’s gains were spent on a 
complex consisting of luxury apartments, shops, restaurants and a hotel 
in Nagubuzi’s home city of Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Plans for 
building new properties were found when police raided the gang’s homes 
across East London.

The Daily Mail told last week how in a
 campaign of deceit lasting more than two decades their ‘family 
business’ saw them ‘conspire together to create, use and exploit’ false 
identities to carry out the staggering fraud.

Yesterday eight of the group were 
sentenced to a total of 19 years by Judge Nicholas Ainley at Croydon 
Crown Court in South London.

He told Nagubuzi: ‘This was a fraud on
 a huge scale and it is an outrageous abuse of the hospitality you were 
offered by this country when you came here in trouble.

Nabaguzi is believed to have regularly travelled back to Uganda and bought at least three properties in and around the capital Kampala, one of them pictured

‘The identities you used and no doubt 
sold were then used by other people. You had no scruples in bringing 
children to this country and then involving them in your criminal 
pursuits. This was motivated entirely by greed. All these identities 
were, for you, valuable commodities.’

The use of so many names to perpetuate
 the fraud led one investigator to remark: ‘The true figure of what 
these people stole from us may never be known. It could be in excess of 
£6million after they launched a systematic assault on our welfare 
system.’

During a six-week trial four 
defendants, all from East London, pleaded not guilty to a string of 
fraud and asylum application offences.

Dennis Kyeyune, 29, and Lamulah 
Sekiziyuvu, 36, were both given sentences totalling 30 months, while 
Jordan Sebutemba, 26 – a mother of children aged five and 11 months – 
was spared jail and given a one-year sentence suspended for two years.

The judge told both Kyeyune and 
Sebutemba: ‘It must have been dispiriting for the jury to listen to both
 of you in the witness box just lying and lying consistently. Kyeyune 
held much of the paperwork and Sebutemba, you were a trusted 
confederate.’

her family, fooled immigration officials and obtained leave to remain in
 the UK under a number of different identities

Albert Kaidi, 27, was also given a 
30-month sentence and told he had ‘lied’ about being from Rwanda when he
 was a native of Uganda.

Yesterday those found guilty were 
joined in the dock by four other gang members who had earlier pleaded 
guilty to numerous offences.

The other guilty fraudsters included 
Nagubuzi, who managed to claim £2,280,000 in HIV/Aids medication for 
herself and in four other identities, which investigators believe she 
has sold for vast profit in Uganda.

Nagubuzi was given a total of six 
years imprisonment and told that an immigration tribunal would look at 
her right to remain in the UK.

Lina Katongola, 29, was jailed for one year

Cameroonian-born fraudster Mathy 
Matumba, 50 – whose real name is believed to be Yvette Syapjeu – was 
given a four-year jail term for using a number of false identities to 
steal more than £350,000 in benefits payments since coming to Britain in
 1998.

Nurse Lina Katongola, 29, was given a 
one-year prison term and Eddie Semanda, 31, was given a four-month 
prison term, suspended for one year, over a false naturalisation 
application.

Paul Raudnitz, prosecuting, said: ‘The
 tentacles of this fraud went far and wide for many, many years. Each 
defendant at different times joined the conspiracy.’ He said ‘key 
player’ Nagubuzi ‘employed multiple identities ... so many that the true
 number of identities may never ever be known’.

Nagubuzi’s claims for Aids drugs 
netted her millions and she even sub-let flats in East London which saw 
her pocket a further £650,000. She received almost £500,000 in housing 
benefit alone from Newham Council.

Nagubuzi came to the UK in 1991 and 
claimed asylum for herself and four children she had left in Uganda. 
Three years later she used the name Jane Namusisi to apply for asylum 
again – along with two more children. In 1999, using the name Pauline 
Zalwango, she applied once more, this time with three children.

She is believed to have regularly travelled to Uganda and bought at least three properties around Kampala.

When police searched the East London 
home of Dennis Kyeyune – thought to be Nagubuzi’s son or nephew – they 
found a black holdall containing a vast array of fake documents, 
described as a ‘kitbag for the commission of identity fraud’.

The judge said that there would be a confiscation hearing at a later date under Proceeds of Crime legislation.

Investigators from the UK Border 
Agency have visited Kampala to try to identify properties bought by 
Nagubuzi and her gang. However, it is believed that in a bid to avoid 
land registry detection in the African country she has ordered that some
 of her homes are not finished by builders so they cannot be officially 
‘signed off’ by building inspectors.

Tony Erne, from the UK Border Agency, said: 'This was a major criminal operation dating back several years. Ruth Nabuguzi and her co-conspirators thought they could get away with it but our officers, working closely with other agencies, smashed their web of deceit.'These sentences show that abuse of our immigration system for profit will not be tolerated. The message is clear to those thinking of doing the same: we will rigorously investigate people who seek to abuse the hospitality of the UK and commit crime.'
