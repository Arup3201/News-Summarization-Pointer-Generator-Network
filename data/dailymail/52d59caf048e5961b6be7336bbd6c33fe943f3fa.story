We're not sure what was on the menu for Robin van Persie and his Dutch pals but it's unlikely to have been Mexican. 

Four defeats in their last five games had left Holland's players in need of a spot of team bonding.

So Arjen Robben, Ibrahim Afellay, Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Van Persie headed to a nearby restaurant following Wednesday's 3-2 defeat by Mexico in Amsterdam.

Carlos Vela scored twice in his first international appearance since 2011 as Mexico exacted revenge for their controversial World Cup exit.

But from the Instagram picture it looks like the meal helped raised the spirits of the Dutch stars.

Holland boss Guus Hiddink will hope it will help them get their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign back on track by beating Latvia on Sunday.

The Dutch manager might be fearful of losing his job if they don't.
