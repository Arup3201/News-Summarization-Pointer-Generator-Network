The disgraced former head of the IMF whisked his girlfriend off for a romantic break in Venice just days after he was photographed cavorting with models in a Paris nightclub.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn's extravagant gesture to the new lady in his life Myriam Aouffir came after he was caught on camera brazenly posing with three attractive young women during a night out with pals in the French capital.

The 64-year-old certainly appeared to pull out all the stops for Ms Aouffir who is 21 years his junior, travelling around the city's famous canals on a luxury speedboat.

Strauss-Kahn's romantic getaway was a world away from his wild Saturday night in Paris. He had set out to enjoy the city's nightlife after agreeing a £3.8million payout to New York hotel 
cleaner Nafissatou Diallo to settle her civil action for sexual assault.

In contrast to his lewd antics in Paris, the self-confessed sex addict appeared to be play the perfect gentleman as he escorted high-profile French television press officer Ms Aouffir around Venice.

He was snapped pushing her luggage along on a trolley at the airport and pointing out the sites in the picturesque Italian city.

Back in France, Strauss-Kahn's problems continue, however. He is still waiting to learn if he will face charges of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

A judge in Lille will rule on December 19 whether he should stand trial over the accusations.

The now cash-strapped economist - once tipped as a future president of France - seemed unworried by his ongoing legal woes as he relaxed at the chic Le Matignon night spot at the weekend.

He and his friends mingled with models, who were at the club to promote a new ready-made cocktail called Sex on the Beach.

Strauss- Kahn and Aouffir are certainly getting around. The have already been seen together on the Mediterranean island of Corsica and last month they were pictured lapping up the sun in Jerusalem.

Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, Myriam Aouffir comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children

Strauss-Kahn only split from his ex-partner Anne Sinclair in October after she had originally stuck by him after he was embroiled in a catalogue of scandals last year.

Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, Myriam Aouffir comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children.

Ms
Aouffir, who studied at Montpellier University, has been seeing Mr 
Strauss-Kahn for a number of months, according to close friends of the 
couple.
