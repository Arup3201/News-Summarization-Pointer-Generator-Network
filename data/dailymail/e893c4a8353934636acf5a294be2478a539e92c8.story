Celtic wide-man Derk Boerrigter faces a two-match ban after being issued with a notice of complaint by the Scottish FA's compliance officer for alleged diving.

The Dutchman went to ground inside the box during the Scottish Premiership clash with St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park on Wednesday night as he was challenged by Dave Mackay.

The Saints captain was sent off by referee John Beaton for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity with Nir Biton scoring from the spot for the visitors' second goal in the 3-0 win.

Boerrigter allegedly breached rule 201, which is 'causing a match official to make an incorrect decision by committing an act of simulation' and has been offered a fixed two-match suspension.

If he does not accept the charge and suspension he will face a disciplinary hearing on Thursday, August 21.

Boerrigter has until Monday at 3pm to respond to the fixed suspension offer.

St Johnstone appealed Mackay's red card and that will also be dealt with on August 21 by a tribunal.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila vowed to speak with Boerrigter if he feels his player is a frequent diver.

He said: 'I haven't seen it but as I said yesterday, there will be decisions for and against Celtic and over 38 games the best team will win.

'But I don't like diving. I don't want to cheat.

'We have to see the pictures and if he dived too easy, I will have to have a little talk with Derk.

'I want fair play but I have to see it before I can say anything.'
