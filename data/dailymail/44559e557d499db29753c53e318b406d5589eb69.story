Manchester City's slow start to the Barclays Premier League season was due to poor preparation, according to full back Pablo Zabaleta.

The Argentinian full back, who has once again been a crucial part of City's defence this season, blamed the champions' disappointing early-season form on a lack of fitness in the club's squad.

But Zabaleta insisted that City, who are on an eight-game winning run in the league, are now back to their best as they hunt down Chelsea.

Zabaleta claims his team-mates were under-prepared at the start of the season, but are now ready to shine

'From the beginning of the season some of the players were not physically 100 per cent,' said Zabaleta. 'But now we look so much better.

'It was hard becasue we probably didn't have enough rest and it wasn't a very long pre-season,' added the Argentine, who played in last summer's World Cup final.

'Now I think everyone has improved. That's why we have got better as a team - and we have to keep playing at this level.

'In the way we want to play, we were lacking some intensity and concentration. It cost us a few points.'

However, going into the busy Christmas period City, who were once nine points behind leaders Chelsea, are now just three points off top spot.

City travel to West Brom on Boxing Day hoping to keep the pressure up on the Premier League's top side.

And Zabeleta believes Jose Mourinho's team are bound to drop points during the festive fixtures.

The likes of Yaya Toure made slow starts to the City title defence, but have started to show their best form 

'Even if Chelsea are winning games and looking solid, it is normal to have a point of the season where you can lose points.

'It will be very hard to play on the 26th and 28th within 48 hours of one another.'
