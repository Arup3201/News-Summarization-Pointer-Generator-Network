The international break may represent a change of scenery for the players but for their managers it's a time when nerves are frayed.

They watch helplessly as their stars fly off to the four corners of the globe to represent their countries and can only pray they don't return injured or fatigued.

But tiredness seems inevitable when you take a look at the air miles some of the Premier League players will be racking up over the next fortnight.

Chelsea's Willian will fly over 14,600 miles to represent Brazil in Far East friendlies with Argentina and Japan

Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho will also be part of the Brazil squad making a long-haul trip to the Far East. Cristian Gamboa, seen tackling him, is in the Costa Rica squad also heading to Asia for friendlies

Jose Mourinho is just one of the Premier League managers concerned their players will come back jet-lagged

The Chelsea trio of Filipe Luis, Oscar and Willian, as well as Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, are named in the Brazil squad for their friendlies against Argentina in Beijing and Japan in Singapore.

They face a gruelling 14,600-mile round trip to fulfil the money-spinning fixtures in the Far East, something that won't please Jose Mourinho or Brendan Rodgers with important club games to come.

Chelsea's Ramires and Manchester City's Fernandinho have already been withdrawn from Dunga's squad for the friendlies, on Saturday and Tuesday, through injury.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal went public with his frustration at summer signings Angel Di Maria and Marcos Rojo having to fly 12,000-plus miles to turn out for Argentina in two friendlies.

As their unconvincing 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday proved, Van Gaal needs time to work with his team ahead of a tough run of fixtures that includes Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in the next six weeks.

Marcos Rojo will also be part of the Argentine party making the 12,276-mile round trip to the Far East

So he was understandably irritated that Di Maria and Rojo are travelling so far to play in meaningless games.

Discussing United's poor second half performance against Everton, Van Gaal said: 'That is why we have to train, but now all my players are gone. The rest are injured so we cannot train. Now I have to wait.

'Di Maria and Rojo are coming back from Hong Kong. They are playing two friendly games. They are coming back with jetlag so I cannot train at once and then I have to wait.

'Then I have only two or three days before the game with West Bromwich Albion. That is my problem I know and we live in this football world.

'I was also a national coach [with Holland] but it is not so easy as everybody thinks.'

Radamel Falcao and Colombia will play friendlies with El Salvador and Canada in New Jersey this week

As mentioned earlier, Argentina are in Beijing to play Brazil in the 2014 Superclasico de las Americas, a fixture that can easily be taken and marketing around the globe, and then play Hong Kong three days later.

Van Gaal can only count his blessings that United's match with West Brom isn't until the Monday night, giving him extra time to prepare.

And he'll take some consolation in the fact Radamel Falcao, who opened his scoring account on Sunday, is 'only' going 6,900 miles over to New Jersey and back for friendlies with El Salvador and Canada.

Others, like Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and QPR's Harry Redknapp, have less time to get ready for the return of the league action.

Arsene Wenger can only wait and hope that all his players return from the international break without injury

Both will wave off the Chilean members of their squad - Alexis Sanchez, Mauricio Isla and Eduardo Vargas - on a 14,577-mile round trip back home for friendlies against Peru on Friday and Bolivia on Tuesday.

Arsenal play Hull City at the Emirates on Saturday afternoon but with Sanchez unlikely to resume training until Thursday at the earliest, he may feel a little sluggish come matchday.

Joel Campbell, meanwhile, is one of five Premier League and Championship players included in the Costa Rica squad that will be making a 13,200-mile whistlestop tour of Muscat in Oman and Seoul in South Korea for two friendlies.

He is joined by Cristian Gamboa of West Brom, Bryan Oviedo of Everton, Jose Miguel Cubero of Blackpool and Bryan Ruiz of Fulham for the long-haul trip.

Everton's Bryan Oviedo has been called up to the Costa Rica squad for matches with Oman and South Korea

Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng will feature for South Korea in two home friendlies with Paraguay and Costa Rica

Other players clocking up a five-figure mileage are the South Korean duo of Ki Sung-yeung of Swansea and Lee Chung-yong of Bolton, who will make the 11,119-mile jaunt home and back for games with Paraguay on Friday and Costa Rica on Tuesday.

Most players will be taking part in European Championship qualifiers, meaning short-haul trips, but there is also competitive action taking place in Africa.

The qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations next year have reached ther half-way point and all the leading nations are in action over the next few days.

The Ivory Coast face a home and away double-header with DR Congo and Yaya Toure, Cheick Tiote and Wilfried Bony are all named in the squad for a round trip of over 8,000 miles.

For the managers, it's time to cross fingers they won't come back tired or, even worse, injured.
