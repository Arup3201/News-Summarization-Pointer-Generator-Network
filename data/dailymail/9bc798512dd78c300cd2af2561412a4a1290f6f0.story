Rags to riches: Ecotricity boss Dale Vince whose application to strike out a compensation claim by his ex-wife is being heard in the Civil Appeal Court

Back then he was a penniless hippy with no income and no apparent prospect of success.

But the winds of change transformed Dale Vince from a nomadic New Age traveller to the multi- millionaire head of one of Britain’s biggest green energy companies.

It’s just that they didn’t blow quite  so favourably for his ex-wife, whom  he divorced without being ordered to pay maintenance.

So yesterday Kathleen Wyatt faced the 51-year-old wind farm entrepreneur across a courtroom over a claim for £2million she says she is owed – more than 20 years after they parted.

Mr Vince was appealing after the  High Court in London refused to dismiss the claim, and ordered him to pay £125,000 legal costs.

Yesterday the Civil Appeal Court heard Miss Wyatt alleged she  was treated ‘with contempt’ by  her ex-husband while he drove increasingly expensive cars and moved  into a £3million, 18th-century fort  in Gloucestershire.

Meanwhile she had to struggle through financial difficulties to  raise their son and her other children – as Mr Vince’s once-fledgling company developed into Ecotricity, currently  a massive player in the UK’s eco  energy sector.

Now judges must decide whether to allow the financial claim, back Mr Vince’s fight to have it dismissed or, as Lord Justice Jackson put it yesterday, declare it ‘so old and stale’ that it should not be allowed to proceed.

Miss Wyatt, a former aid worker with a daughter from a previous relationship, met Mr Vince in 1981 and they had a son, Dane, two years later.

The court heard Mr Vince took up a ‘nomadic’ existence as a New Age traveller when he and Miss Wyatt, according to Mr Vince, separated in 1984.

He disputed Miss Wyatt’s claims that the pair repeatedly rekindled their relationship until the early Nineties.

His barrister Martin Pointer QC told the Civil Appeal Court that Mr Vince was not ordered to pay any maintenance as he was broke at the time and living on housing benefit.

In 1992, when the couple divorced, Mr Vince ‘had a nascent business but no income at all’, he said.

Mr Vince with his £1million electric supercar: His ex-wife Kathleen Wyatt tried and failed to get him to pay her maintenance while he drove 'better and better' cars and moved into a £3million property, her barrister said

Living the high life: Mr Vince, centre, now runs a successful business, while his ex-wife was forced to sleep in a bus garage in order to travel by public transport to the hearing, her barrister claimed at the Civil Appeal Court

 In 1996 he had made a ‘full disclosure’ of his financial position to the Child Support Agency, Mr Pointer said.

‘From a modest beginning,  with the 
creation of a wind turbine to power a trailer in which he and his new 
partner were living, the business developed into a considerable 
enterprise.’

Miss Wyatt started a new relationship 
in 1993 and had two  more children, although she did not remarry. She 
later discovered her ex-husband’s business was flourishing.

But Philip Cayford QC, representing 
her, said Mr Vince provided only three very old cars and ‘sporadic 
pocket money’ for his son and stepdaughter until 2001.

The barrister said between 1996 and 
1997 he achieved a ‘nil assessment’ for contributions by the Child 
Support Agency despite his ‘apparent wealth’.

'Considerable enterprise': Mr Vince in the Nineties set up a wind energy business with a new girlfriend that developed into Ecotricity, now a massive player in the UK's eco energy sector, with over 70,000 customers

He said Miss Wyatt, now 53 and living 
in Monmouthshire in south-east Wales, learned Mr Vince’s business was 
taking off in the mid-Nineties and claimed that ‘the children had been 
pressured by him not to inform her of his newly acquired wealth’.

The QC added: ‘Miss Wyatt repeatedly 
asked for financial assistance and whether he was going to pay the 
children more than just pocket money as he was building up his business.

‘He treated her with contempt. He said
if she could not afford to maintain the children, they could live with 
him.’ Mr Cayford said: ‘This is a lady who has had it financially very 
difficult.

‘She came to court today by getting up
early to use the bus, and sleeping in the bus station. The contrast 
between the two [her and Mr Vince] is extreme.’

The court reserved judgement on the 
appeal. If it fails, the maintenance claim is expected to be heard by a 
family judge in June.
