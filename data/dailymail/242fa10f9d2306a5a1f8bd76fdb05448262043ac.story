A tiny one-bedroom mews property wedged between two homes near Harrods in Knightsbridge is available to rent for more than £3,000 a month.

The property, tucked away on a street which was once home to politician John Profumo and music mogul Brian Epstein, has just 447 sq/ft of space, which is less than half the UK average, and is sandwiched between two neighbouring buildings which tower over it.

Inside, there are just two rooms - an open-plan 20ft long reception room and kitchen, and the double bedroom with en-suite upstairs. 

'Hideaway': This tiny one-bedroom mews property, which covers just 447 sq/ft of space and wedged between two homes near Harrods in Knightsbridge, is available to rent for more than £3,000 a month

City living: Inside, there are just two rooms - an open-plan 20ft long reception room and kitchen, and the double bedroom with en-suite upstairs

But despite this, the home, described as a 'luxurious hideaway in the centre of London', has been put on the rental market 'at only' £725 per week.

This works out at £37,700 per year, which is almost one-and-a-half times the average UK salary and three times the UK minimum wage.

It is also located on a mews, which historically would have been staff quarters for people working in nearby mansions. They were also used as stables to house horses.

However, if today’s working class Londoners earning the living wage of £9.15 per hour put everything they took home towards rent, they would still be £435 short of the rent - every week.

Sought after: The pint-sized pied-a-terre is located in SW1, one of London’s most desirable postcodes in the heart of Knightsbridge

The pint-sized pied-a-terre is located in SW1, one of London’s most desirable postcodes, just behind Harvey Nichols in the heart of Knightsbridge.

During World War Two, the mews was completely destroyed after the Germans dropped a V1 bomb on the street.

A new street was rebuilt after the war and is now made  homes with an average value of £2million.

Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates which is marketing the property, said: 'Mews houses have risen from being servant’s quarters in Victorian times to being some of the most desirable property in London’s most expensive postcodes.

'William Mews is located within walking distance of Harrods and provides a luxurious setting to come home to in Knightsbridge.

'Whether used as main residence or pied a terre, the house offers excellent value for an area steeped in history.'
