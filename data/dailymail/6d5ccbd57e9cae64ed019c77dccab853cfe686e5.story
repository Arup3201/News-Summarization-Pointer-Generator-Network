The sons of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty have admitted their role in a violent street brawl between feuding gypsy clans.

Several men were involved in the punch-up when rival families clashed outside Manchester magistrates court in Spinningfields.

The fight broke out after brothers John and Dougie Joyce appeared before magistrates, accused of attacking Doherty, their cousin.

The incident will bring embarrassment to Sally Bercow, the wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has since become friends with Doherty after they appeared together on Celebrity Big Brother.

Eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long-standing feud between the groups.

They included John, 24, and Simon Doherty, 32, who pleaded guilty to affray - which can carry a jail sentence.

Their brother David, 27, admitted a lesser public-order offence.

Six members of the Joyce and Ward clans also appeared at Manchester Crown Court.

Paddy Doherty, 52, a former bare knuckle fighter, almost had his ear bitten off in a fight outside the PC World store in Ancoats.

The Joyce family had been to court to support Johnny and Dougie Joyce.

They were approached by Simon, David and John Doherty as they left the court.
