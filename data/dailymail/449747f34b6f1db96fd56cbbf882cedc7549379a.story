A pregnant mother told by doctors aborting one of her twin girls would save the other said the seemingly impossible decision was simple - she would keep both babies.

Carmelle Hartgrove and her husband Steve, 36, were overjoyed to discover they were expecting twins.

But that joy quickly turned to despair when a 10-week scan revealed the twin girls were unlikely to both survive to full term.

The 32-year-old was told her unborn babies were both monoamniotic and monochorionic.

The conditions meant the babies shared the same amniotic sac and placenta - putting them at risk of dangerous complications.

Carmelle Hartgrove, 32, from Harlow in Essex, was overjoyed to discover she was expecting twins in November 2012. But a 10-week scan revealed her babies were unlikely to survive to full term

The twins were found to share the same amniotic sac and placenta, putting them at risk of dangerous complications. Their close proximity in the womb meant their umbilical cords could easily become tangled, cutting off their oxygen and food supply. But Charis and Connie survived, and were born in 2013

Sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta means the twins' umbilical cords become tangled, restricting the flow of oxygen and nutrients essential for growth and survival.

Specialists warned the couple, if left untreated, their baby daughters had just a 30 per cent change of surviving.

They said aborting one of the babies could save the other.

But the Hartgroves were adamant, without needing to discuss the matter - they would keep both babies.

And in 2013, at 32 weeks pregnant Mrs Hartgrove went into labour, giving birth to two healthy girls.

Now 20 months, Charis and Connie, are healthy baby girls.

'I look at them both now and think about what miracles they really are,' Mrs Hartgrove said.

'In the end, it was not a difficult decision. A 30 per cent chance of survival was good enough for me.' 

Mr Hartgrove, a lorry driver, and his wife already had two children, Charlotte, 12, and nine-year-old Callum, when they started trying for a third baby. 

Mrs Hartgrove, a human resources manager, discovered she was pregnant with the twins in November 2012, after a miscarriage six months earlier.

'At the 10-week scan when I was told there were two flickering heart beats, I couldn't believe it,' she recalled. 

'I started laughing with happiness. I was giggling so much that Steve had to ask me to stop as you couldn't see the scan because I was moving around too much.'

Mrs Hartgrove said she and her husband Steve, right, did not have to discuss their decision when doctors said they could terminate one baby to save the other. She said they both immediately refused, deciding to keep both their unborn babies despite them having just a 30 per cent chance of surviving

Fearing she would lose her babies, Mrs Hartgrove didn't tell anyone she was pregnant until she was 24 weeks along. The mother-of-five said: ' I was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord'

But at 32 weeks, Mrs Hartgrove went into hospital to have her babies via C-section. Charis and Connie, who are now 20 months old, are both happy, healthy babies

But quickly, the mood changed.

Medics revealed there was no dividing membrane between the two babies - indicating it would be a high-risk pregnancy.

Weeks later the couple were told their daughters were sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta. 

Monoamnitotic twins are identical twins that develop inside the same amniotic sac.

They share a placenta within their mother's uterus, but have two separate umbilical cords for nourishment.

The condition is rare, occuring in one around one in 35,000 to one in 60,000 pregnancies.

Monoamniotic twins are at greater risk of health complications due to the close proximity of the two umbilical cords in the amniotic sac.

It means it is easy for the babies to become entangled, or to compress each other's cords, threatening their oxygen and food supply.

Experts are unsure as to how monoamniotic twins develop.

Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits at some point after fertilisation.

The timing of the division determines the separateness of the placentas and amniotic sacs.

The unborn twin girls were at risk of dangerous cord entanglement and compression.    

Mrs Hartgrove was offered the chance to undergo a double termination, or selective reduction which would mean aborting one twin so the other could live.

'How could I choose between the two?' she said. 'I would always look at the twin which survived and think 'I killed someone to save you.

'Steve and I didn't even need to have that conversation - we were united on the decision without having to discuss it.'

For the rest of her pregnancy Mrs Hartgrove was plagued with worry that the twins would not survive 32 weeks.

She said: 'I couldn't bear the idea of having to tell people I had lost the baby, so I didn't tell people I was pregnant until 24 weeks.

'I went into hiding. I even worked from home.

'I was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord.'

All it would take to kill them was is if they stopped cuddling each other and pulled on the cord.

'There wasn't a day which went by where I didn't panic that they had died because I couldn't feel them moving.

'It was a very stressful pregnancy. I would not wish that kind of stressful experience upon anyone.'

Eventually at 32 weeks the twins, Charis Faith and Connie Grace, were born by C-section.

Both weighed a little over 4lbs and spent 20 days in special care.

Mrs Hartgroive, also mother to Callum, nine, and Charlotte, 12, and baby Carter born since the twins' birth, said: 'When I think about the odds we were given and I hear about women who went through similar pregnancies I think I am so lucky to have both of them healthy and well'

Mrs Hartgrove said her twin daughters used to sleep huddled next to one another as newborns, and even now they climb into each others cots in the morning

Mrs Hartgrove said: 'After Steve cut the cord on both of them he passed out immediately. 

'It was very hot in there and he had been sat down all day, as soon as he cut the second cord he hit the deck.

'After I was wheeled into recovery I found myself in a bed opposite him - it was a dramatic end to a dramatic pregnancy.'

The twins are now both 20 months old and very healthy.

Mrs Hartgrove said: 'When they were newborns they used to sleep huddled up next to each other like they did in the womb. 

'Even now they are in separate beds they will climb into each others cots in the morning.

'I have a picture of the tangled placenta and cord - it is a big jumbled up knot. 

'I look at it and think how on Earth did any blood flow get through that?

'When I think about the odds we were given and I hear about women who went through similar pregnancies I think I am so lucky to have both of them healthy and well.'

Mrs Hartgrove recently gave birth to another baby boy called Carter.

She said: 'It was a doddle giving birth to him in comparison to the twins.'
