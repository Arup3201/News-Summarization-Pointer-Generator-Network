A missile designed to destroy nuclear missiles after they have been fired failed to hit its target during a test launch.

The ground-based interceptor missile fired from Vanderberg Air Force Base was supposed to hit a missile launched in the Kwajalein Atoll 4,000 miles away.

It was the third consecutive failure of the Interceptor system, which is managed by Boeing Co, according to defense officials.

In theory, the missile defense system is supposed to use on board sensors to track incoming missiles, and then guide itself directly into the weapon's path.

Radars that track its progress, would continue to take in data to confirm that the hit had been successful.

The $214 million test launch of the only defense the U.S. has against long-range missiles took place over the Pacific, according to RT.

Defense officials will now examine what prevented the interceptor from tracking and stopping its target.

'Program officials will conduct an 
extensive review to determine the cause or causes of any anomalies which
 may have prevented a successful intercept,' a spokesman for the Pentagon told Fox News.

About 30 interceptors are based in Vanderberg, southern California, and Alaska as part of the country's missile defense program that started in 2004.

The Pentagon plans to spend another $1 billion on 14 more interceptors in Alaska, which is currently home to 26, after concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

The military has tested the so-called ground-based mid-course defense system 16 times. It has succeeded eight times, with the last intercept in December 2008.

Friday's test was the second to be held at the Californian base this year, and the first launch practice since a failed test in December 2010.

The test that took place in January focused on maneuvers as opposed to tracking a target.
