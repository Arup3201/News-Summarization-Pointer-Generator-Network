A mother and her new husband have been charged with the murder of her toddler daughter -  just two days after the couple decided to get married.

Summer Everett, 22, and her husband Christopher Knapp, 24, were arrested on Wednesday and were being held at Mobile County Jail in Alabama. They were also charged with aggravated child abuse.

DaKota Burke, who was 20 months old, died on January 8 at USA Medical Center after she was brought in suffering burns and vicious bruising a week previously.

Summer Everett, 22, and her husband of two days Christopher Knapp, 24, were charged with her daughter's murder on Wednesday in Alabama

The toddler had been rushed to hospital on December 31 after the mother found her daughter unconscious at their home. 

Sheriff deputies were called by medics to the hospital. A statement was later released which read: 'The child's hands, feet and face were burned. There was noticeable trauma to the face and head of the child.'

The child's cause of death has not been released nor further details of the abuse.  

Everett and Knapp, who is not the child's father, married on January 12 - four days after the baby girl died.

Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran told al.com: 'It's pretty odd. I have never seen it before... to get married even before they buried the child.'

The sheriff also said that his staff had been deeply affected by the tragic abuse that the little girl had suffered. 

He added: 'They have never seen such harm inflicted on a child. The child endured quite a bit of harm before dying.'

The newlyweds, of Semmes, Alabama, refused to comment as they were brought into the sheriff's office on Wednesday in handcuffs, with Everett in floods of tears and Knapp showing no emotion.

The couple have hired lawyers and have refused to cooperate with authorities. 

Neither Everett nor Knapps has no prior criminal records, according to public records.  

Devastated family members have taken to social media to remember the little girl. A message on a Facebook page in her honor, read: 'DaKota Aryn Burke-Everett was a loving & joyful baby girl, so full of life. 

'Tragically, her life was cut short at only 20-months-old. Justice is DEMANDED!'

Her funeral is due to be held on Saturday, according to relatives. 

The little girl's abuse shocked investigators, the Mobile County sheriff said on Wednesday, after her mother and new husband were charged with murder
