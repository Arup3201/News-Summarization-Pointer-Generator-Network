A 21-year-old student escaped with just cuts and bruises as a giant tree fell on top of her head as she waited at a bus stop.

Bethany Dybacz was immediately knocked unconscious when the tree, thought to have fallen because it was rotten, toppled onto her head.

She was rushed to hospital from the bus stop in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, but was well enough to return home just a few hours later, escaping with a minor head injury.

Ms Dybacz, who studies biology at Sheffield Hallam University was also treated for scratches, bruises, and swelling to her back, elbows and knees when she arrived at Northern General Hospital.

Ms Dybacz's boyfriend Thomas Chamberlain was also told of the dramatic incident and hurried to be by her side.

She is now recovering at her parents' home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

'My dad went to pick up my stuff and bought back a bit of the wood with him as a souvenir - he said we could make a chopping board out of it.

'If I wasn’t laughing I would be crying. The tree hit me, but it could have hit a child.'
