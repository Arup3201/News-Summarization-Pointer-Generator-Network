Lady Gaga has launched a scathing attack on her former personal assistant who is suing her for unpaid overtime, saying Jennifer O'Neill doesn't deserve the cash and it should go to another staff member who is battling breast cancer.

The Edge Of Glory singer is being sued by her O'Neill, who claims Gaga owes her $380,000 in overtime payments because she was forced to spend 24 hours a day with her, but the superstar insists the ex-staff member doesn't 'deserve' the money as she will just go 'and buy another tube top'.

According to The Sun newspaper, she testified: 'Now her parents will keep paying for her and keep her until my cheque comes through, which she doesn't deserve and I'm not giving to her.

'She doesn't deserve a dollar more. I'm going to give all the money she wants to my employees that work hard for me and deserve it.

'I am going to give it to Sonja for her breast cancer, for her mastectomy. I'm not going to give it to [Jennifer] so she can go and buy a new tube top.'

Jennifer insists Gaga's diva demands during her 'Monster Ball' world tour in 2010 left her exhausted.

According to court documents, she claims 
she had zero privacy and was forced to share the same bed as the 
26-year-old star, who would wake her up in the middle of the night to 
change DVDs because she didn't want to walk across the hotel room.

In her testimony, Gaga branded Jennifer a 'f**king hood rat' and slammed her demands for overtime payments.

She ranted: 'She thinks she's just like the queen of the universe. And, you know what, she didn't want to be a slave to one, because in my work and what I do, I'm the queen of the universe every day.'

'I was by her side virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” O’Neill said in her deposition. 'That includes sleeping in the same bed with her. Because she did not sleep alone.'

When asked if it was requirement for O'Neill to share the same sleeping quarters with Gaga, she responded: 'I felt it was.'

Demanding: O'Neill says that Gaga made outlandish demands during her time as PA to the star

O'Neill said that she was the only member of Gaga's entourage that didn't have her own hotel room.

'Unlike anybody else on that tour, I did not have my own hotel room. I was not asked if I wanted my own hotel room,' she said.

'I had no privacy, no chance to talk to any family, no chance to talk to any friends, no chance to have sex if I wanted to have sex. There was no chance to do anything.'

In the deposition documents, obtained by the New York Post, O'Neill does not make any suggestion that she and the singer had any kind of sexual relationship.

But she claims that Gaga was incredibly demanding, not giving her anytime to do anything for herself.

'And she was quite irate that she couldn’t reach me on my phone a couple of times, and was quite angry and asked me why she was paying for this hotel room if I was unreachable,' she said in the deposition.

O'Neill also describes one time that Gaga made several demands whist O'Neill was trying to get her hair cut.

'She might have said I need some tea, I need — can you get my computer for me, can you get my phone, my battery is dead, I need a tampon, the toilet doesn’t flush,' O’Neill said.

'Another thing she would do in the middle of the night, would be wake me up to have me change the DVD in the DVD player because she didn’t want to watch that DVD any more and she couldn’t get up to walk across the room to change the DVD herself.'

Gaga tweeted somewhat of a response to the new emerging details on her Twitter account on Saturday, claiming that O'Neill had, as well as being her personal assistant, been one of her good friends.

'Everyone's headlines need an updating. "former assistant" is actually "my best friend from NY since I was 19." Painful stuff,' she wrote.

O'Neill launched her legal action against the Poker Face singer, claiming she was overworked and underpaid, at the end of last year.

O’Neill, from Long Island, was employed by the star for 13 months, accompanying her on her Monster Ball world tour in 2011.

She alleges that she she put in 7,168 hours of unpaid overtime and is now owed more than $380,000, according to the report in the New York Post.

The 41-year-old claims she had to cater to the singer's at times unreasonable demands around the clock.

She insists she had to ensure 'the 
promptness of a towel following a shower and serving as a personal alarm
clock to keep [Gaga] on schedule.'

She was not given breaks for meals 'or, at times, even sleep,' and needed to be available at the star's 'earliest waking hour' or for 'spontaneous, random matters in the middle of the night,' according to the court papers.

O’Neill, who was paid $75,000-a-year, also had to ensue 'the availability of chosen outfits'. Gaga is, of course, famous for her eccentric wardrobe and once wore a meat dress to MTV Video Music Awards.

She filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court in December against the superstar’s Mermaid Touring company for unpaid overtime.

Gaga dismissed Jennifer's lawsuit in in a video-taped deposition from August last year in New York, saying: '[Jennifer is a] f***ing hood rat who is suing me for money that she didn't earn.

'She thinks she's just like the queen of the universe. And, you know what, she didn't want to be a slave to one, because in my work and what I do, I'm the queen of the universe every day.

'She knew there was no overtime, and I never paid her overtime the first time I hired her, so why would she be paid overtime the second time? This whole case is b******* and you know it.'

O'Neill is not the first personal assistant to complain about working for the star, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta.

Former employee Angela Ciemny also claimed she was required to sleep with Gaga most nights because she refused to be alone, according to the book Poker Face: The Rise and Rise of Lady Gaga.
