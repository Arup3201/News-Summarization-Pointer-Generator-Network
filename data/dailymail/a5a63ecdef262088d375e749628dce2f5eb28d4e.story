It sounds like the plot of a romantic comedy - but whether or not it's going to end like one has yet to be seen.

A man from New Zealand has launched a Facebook campaign to track down an American woman he met at a New Year's Eve celebration in Hong Kong at the start of this year.

Reese McKee, 25, from Wellington, captured a photograph of the woman but knows little else about her - simply that her name is 'Katie' and that she's from Washington, D.C.

He explained that he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her.

Who is she? Reese McKee, right, has launched a Facebook search for a woman named 'Katie', left, whom he met in Hong Kong on New Year's Eve. When they parted, she said: 'Find me'

'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.'

The pair spent the night dancing, drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways.

Before she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: 'Find me.'

On a Facebook campaign, he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone - 'and the good memories came sweeping back'.

But he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he had no luck.

He spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on Facebook in June.

Search: He launched a Facebook search to find her - but so far he has not discovered who she is

'But the timing wasn't right,' he told the Herald. 'I think this time of year people have hope for the magic [of Christmas].'

And it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the Facebook page.

But while the story has gathered 
international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is
a hoax - the mysterious Katie has yet to be identified.

Before removing the Facebook page, McKee explained why he was looking for her.

'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 'The 
hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was 
too much. For too long, this has effected my relationships, and I've 
failed people.

Chance meeting: The pair met at New Year fireworks in Hong Kong (pictured) when he spotted her crying alone and befriended her. They went on to dance and party before saying goodbye

'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right.

'While the main aim of this event has 
been to reconnect with the now infamous "Katie", it's also about me, 
finding myself and who I know I can be. I hope to find her. And along the way, find myself.'

But he said he has no illusions and that he wouldn't be surprised if Katie had another boyfriend but that he was 'foolishly optimistic'.

'The chances are billions to one, but I like those odds,' he wrote. 'The is me putting all my chips on the table because it's go hard or go home and I am not going to give in.'

He added: 'Even if I could just find her and say thanks, because it's been a life-changing year and it all started that night, really.'
