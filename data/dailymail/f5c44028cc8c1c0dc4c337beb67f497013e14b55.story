Tireless ‘name and shame’ campaigner Derryn Hinch has praised the Northern Territory as it becomes the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce a public sex offender register, to be named after murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe.

Daniel was murdered in 2003, at the age of 13, by a man with a long history of abusing children. 

Hinch has urged other states that they must now follow in introducing a website that would include an image, physical description and regional whereabouts of convicted ‘serious sex offenders’.

'This is a crack in the wall. I thought it would be Queensland that became the first state to crumble. But now one has the others will fall in line too. It won’t happen overnight but it will happen,' Mr Hinch told Daily Mail Australia.’ 

The move comes after a decade of Daniel's parent's, Bruce and Denise, calling for a national sex offender register, a proposal recently rejected by other states and territories at a Council of Australian Governments meeting.

'Every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood,' they said in a statement.

A public sex offender register named after murdered teenager Daniel Morcombe will be introduced in the NT

'We truly hope that the introduction of Daniel's Law will prevent another family going through the pain and grief we experienced following Daniel's death.' 

Mr Hinch added: ‘I can’t stress how important it is that it’s going to happen… You can’t listen to the rubbish saying it will drive them underground - they are already underground. Their biggest weapon is secrecy.' 

The veteran journalist, who was informed of the NT legislation by  Bruce Morcombe, said it is important for the website to be nationalised or sex offenders will simply move and cross state borders.

‘If you are a predator in the Northern Territory and a photo description of you is online, why wouldn’t you move elsewhere in Australia?’ he asked.

Mr Hinch, who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who sex offenders are, said that Australia is home to over 100,000 predators.

In NSW there are 7,000 convicted sex offenders, for example, but he claims 'even police officers don’t have an automatic right to know who or where they are'.

This year Mr Hinch completed a ten-day, 180-kilometre, walk from Langi Kal Kal Prison, where he had been serving 50 days in lieu of a $100,000 fine for contempt of court, to Victoria’s Parliament House.

Upon reaching Parliament House, flanked by Daniel Morcombe’s parents, he presented a petition with nearly 130,000 names calling for a national public register of convicted paedophiles.

Bruce Morcombe phoned him on Wednesday to share the NT news.

'He said hey “it’s going to happen in the NT” he knows how passionate I am.'

It is finally a sign of progress for the ardent campaigner, who spent two weeks in solitary confinement in a locked prison cell just metres away from convicted sex offenders – the people he is fighting against - while in jail this year.

Mr Hinch explained that there has been resistance to introduce a public sex offenders register in Australia because of fears of vigilante action.

However, after visiting the United States, where they have had a public register named Megan’s Law since 1996, Mr Hinch is convinced it would work in Australia.

‘In Texas they have more guns than Tim Tams but the register works there,’ Mr Hinch said.

Daniel was last seen waiting at a bus stop on the Sunshine Coast when he was abducted and later murdered by serial child sex offender Brett Peter Cowan. It was another eight years before his remains were found

‘When I was in Florida the sheriff showed me street signs saying “warning predator lives here"… I got an app on my phone in Time Square [in New York] that showed me there were 25 predators in the area – it showed me their name, photos and address.

‘I drove around Texas with Sarah Monahan, Robert Hughes’ victim, the app showed us paedophiles' houses. It means people can warn their children “don’t knock on that door”… that’s the common sense attitude,’ Mr Hinch reasoned.

In his eyes  ‘knowledge is power’.

Mr Hinch said he is still waiting to find out the details of Daniel’s Law, for example “what constitutes a serious sex offender”, but hopes that within three years there is a national register.

'The federal government has the power to overturn the legislation but I don’t think they would be stupid enough to do this,' Mr Hinch added.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has indicated he's not in favour of a national sex offenders register

Federal coalition MP George Christensen has also urged the Abbott government to roll out the register nationally, saying sex offenders gave up their right to privacy by committing the 'most heinous of crimes'.

'Parents have a right to know where these serious sex offenders are and what they look like so they can protect their children,' the Liberal National MP said.

'We owe it to the Morcombes and to all parents to do whatever we can to avoid the same thing happening again.'

However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has indicated he's not in favour of a national sex offenders register, saying such lists don't exist for murderers, thieves or white collar criminals. 

Mr Abbott says he's 'disinclined' to single out particular crimes for public registers.

'We don't have a national murders register. We don't have a national thieves register. We don't have a national white collar criminals register,' he told reporters in Melbourne.

'The important thing is ... to have strong and effective law enforcement agencies, to have strong and effective laws.'
