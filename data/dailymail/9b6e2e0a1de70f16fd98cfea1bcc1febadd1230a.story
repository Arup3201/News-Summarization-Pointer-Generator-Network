A U.S. Navy minesweeper that ran aground on a Philippine reef is taking on water through holes and will have to be lifted off the rocks in an operation that could last another fortnight.

Before the USS Guardian can be removed from the Tubbataha Reef, about 56,000 liters (15,000 gallons) of fuel will be siphoned off to avoid spills.

The ship, which is based in Japan, crashed into the reef before dawn January 17 while on its way to Indonesia after making a rest and refueling stop in Subic Bay, a former American naval base west of Manila.

Investigation: U.S. Navy salvage assessment team members boarding the stern of the USS Guardian in the area of Tubbataha Reef, western Philippines

Aground: The USS Guardian ran aground in the Tubbataha National Marine Park, a World Heritage Site, on 17 January

Problem: The US Navy said it needed to remove thousands of litres of oil from a minesweeper stuck on World Heritage-listed coral in the Philippines, warning it was too badly damaged to be towed away

All of its 79 officers and crew were transferred to two other U.S. vessels the following day for safety reasons as the 68-meter (74-yard) long, 1,300-ton ship was unable to maneuver on its own and buffeted by strong winds and waves.

Rear Adm. Thomas Carney, commander of the Navy's Logistics Group in the Western Pacific, told reporters the ship is hard aground about 30 meters from the edge of the reef, a marine sanctuary that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

'It's got hull penetration in several places, and there is a significant amount of water inside the ship right now,' he said.

Fine: The Philippine government said it wants to fine the Navy for the damage and illegal entry into the marine sanctuary

Attempt: Philippine coast guard chief Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said efforts to remove the fuel have been hampered by the rough waters

Operation: Mr Carney said heavy items aboard the ship will be taken off to lighten it before the vessel is loaded on another ship or barge

Philippine coast guard chief Rear 
Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said efforts to remove the fuel have been hampered 
by the rough waters and another attempt will be made again today.

Mr Carney said heavy items aboard the ship will be taken off to lighten it before the vessel is loaded on another ship or barge.

He said the operation could last a week or two.

Location: The US Navy ship was minesweeping in the Sulu Sea, 400 miles southwest of Manila, in the Philippines

'I want to express my deepest regret for the circumstances that we are all in right now,'Â  Mr Carney said.

He said an investigation will look into all the factors that may have led to the grounding, including a reported faulty digital chart, sea conditions, weather and the state of the ship's navigational equipment.

The Philippine government said it wants to fine the Navy for the damage and illegal entry into the marine sanctuary.

Calls: Earlier this week activists protested against the presence of US military in the country, and called for authorities to investigate the USS Guardian which ran aground

Anger: Filipino protesters march with a banner carrying a message against US military forces during a demonstration in Manila, Philippines

Dismay: Protesters display placards, including a mock model of the USS Guardian

Scuffle: Police push back protesters as they attempt to hold a rally outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila

Angelique Songco, head of the Protected Areas Management Board, which is in charge of the reef, said the government imposes a fine of about $300 per square meter of damaged coral plus about the same amount for rehabilitation and other violations.

Carney said that after the ship is removed, the damage to the reef would be assessed and the two governments, which have close military and political ties, will discuss any claims.

Earlier in the week Filipino protesters scuffled with anti-riot police during a protest rally in front of the US embassy in Manila.

Protesters also set fire to a mock model of the USS Guardian as they protested against the presence of US military presence in the country, and called for authorities to investigate.
