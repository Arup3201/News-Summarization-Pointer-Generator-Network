Once upon a time, Grayson Perry designed a fairy-tale holiday home.

But as the cross-dressing artist’s creation resembles a gingerbread cottage clad in bottle-green tiles with a gold roof, the neighbours are not too keen.

Several bitterly objected to the proposed building on the banks of the River Stour on the edge of Wrabness, near Harwich, Essex.

The village with a sweet tooth: The proposed gingerbread house has been attacked by residents who claim it looks like something out of Disneyland

‘I think it is completely out of 
keeping with our beautiful estuary – rather like Disneyland,’ said one 
disgruntled local in a letter to the local authority.

Another complained: ‘Why have we got 
this ugly looking house or whatever you would like to call it?’ A third 
objector called it ‘pseudo-subversive neo-kitsch’.

The parish council, meanwhile, was 
worried it ‘does not fit in with the landscape, which is in a proposed 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty’.

But with the protesters outnumbered 
four to one by supporters, the story ended happily ever after for 
52-year-old Perry, with planning permission granted by Tendring District
Council for his first foray into architecture.

Big ideas: Grayson Perry says his new project will improve the cultural standing of the area

Residents living in the quiet village have been left fuming after the Turner Prize-winning artist was given the go-ahead to demolish the old farmhouse

Claire and present danger: The proposal by Grayson Perry, seen here as his alter-ego Claire, has angered people in the village

Perry, himself born in Chelmsford, 
said the two-bedroom house, which holidaymakers will be able to rent, 
will tell the story of an imaginary Essex woman called Julie and 
‘relates to buildings put up as memories to loved ones, to follies, to 
eccentric homebuilt structures, to shrines, lighthouses and fairy 
tales’.

It will be topped with a statue of 
Julie and the walls will be clad with tiles bearing her image, a weather
vane will be ‘a celebration of her mothering skills’ and over the front
door will be a sculpture of her cat.

A semi-derelict farmhouse currently occupies the overgrown quarter-acre plot, at the end of a single-track lane.

It will be demolished to make way for Perry’s house, which will be more than 500 yards from the nearest property.

Better known for his ceramic works, 
Perry, who won the Turner Prize in 2003 and has since been a panellist 
on Have I Got News For You, admitted his initial design for the house 
was carried out while ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of  
the television’.

The project was commissioned by Living
Architecture, a body set up by the philosopher and lateral thinker 
Alain de Botton which aims to ‘revolutionise’ architecture and UK 
holiday rentals.

The Perry-designed house is expected to be open for paying guests in 2014.

How much it will cost to rent is not 
yet known. Other, larger properties are advertised on Living 
Architecture’s website at a cost of around £25 per person per night.
