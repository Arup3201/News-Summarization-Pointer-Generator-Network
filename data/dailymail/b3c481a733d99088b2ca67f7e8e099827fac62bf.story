The U.S. Mega Millions jackpot grew to an estimated $400 million for the next draw on Friday after no one won the top prize of $344 million on Tuesday evening, lottery organizers said.

The next draw is slated for Friday, December 13 - considered an unlucky date by some - at 11 p.m. E.T. (0400 GMT Saturday).

If the winner chose to take a cash prize instead of an annuity, it would amount to $216 million, according to Mega Millions officials.

Jackpot! This Friday's jackpot is likely to hit the $400 million mark. Will you be lucky on Friday 13th?

Up for grabs: No one matched the numbers of 5, 12, 22, 41, 65 and the Mega Ball 13, meaning the jackpot will continue to roll

Pay to play: The Mega Millions is played in 43 states and only costs $1 per ticket. Whatta deal!

Tuesday's top prize had a cash payout 
option of $184 million, according to the lottery, which is played in a 
majority of U.S. states. The winning numbers from that drawing were: 5, 
12, 22, 41, 65 and 13, Mega Millions said.

No
one has won the jackpot in more than two months, pushing the purse 
steadily higher, although it remains well below the record-setting $656 
million won on March 30, 2012.

The next largest prizes in the 17-year history of Mega Millions were worth $390 million and $380 million.

Five tickets worth $1 million were sold in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Ohio. Those tickets matched the first five numbers.

There’s no word which stores sold those tickets.

It could be you: But then again, it probably won't be!

To win, you need to match six numbers -- five from 1 to 75 and one from 1 to 15.

In
addition to the jackpot, there are eight other winning combinations for
prizes, of $1, $2, $5, $50, $500, $5,000 and $1 million.

If one ticket matches all six numbers for the $400 million mega-jackpot, the winner will have the choice of receiving the full jackpot in 30 annual payments, or a cash option of approximately $216.4 million before taxes.

'The strong sales of Mega Millions tickets mean more than just an exciting jackpot,' said Paula Otto, executive director of the Virginia Lottery and lead director for the Mega Millions group.

'They mean greater profits to benefit each state in which Mega Millions is played.'

Friday's jackpot has been growing since October 1st, when Mega Millions had its most recent jackpot winner. The jackpot has now rolled 20 times without a winner.

This is the largest jackpot since 
changes were made to Mega Millions that include larger starting 
jackpots, a million-dollar second prize, and a new matrix of 1-75 for 
the first five numbers and 1-15 for the Mega Ball number.

One thing that did not change is the price of a Mega Millions ticket: still $1.

The
odds of winning the jackpot are approximately one in 259 million. The 
odds of winning any of the Mega Millions prizes are approximately 1 in 
15.

Mega Millions 
holds the record for the largest jackpot ever, at $656 million. That 
jackpot on March 30, 2012, was split by three winning tickets in 
Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.

The
average American is more likely to be killed in a mass murder than win 
the jackpot. Fifty three times more likely, in fact. Dying in an 
avalanche sometime in the next decade is 160 times more likely than 
winning.

Unfortunately, not all Americans have a chance of winning the biggest jackpot in history as Mega Millions is only played in 43 states.

However residents in other non-playing 
states can purchase tickets in the states they are sold in as there is 
no residency requirement to play and win.

Even non U.S. citizens are allowed to play, but the tax they would have to pay on winnings is different.

At 173-million-to-one, the odds of 
scoring the largest lottery win in US history are so long they're 
literally unfathomable. And mathematicians say there's no way to improve
them - except by buying more tickets.

In theory, with such a massive jackpot would be possible to 'invest' $173 million to play every number combination and then rake in $560 million in winnings.

What would you do with $400 million? There's only one way to find out and that's by filling out the numbers

That is, at $1 a ticket, and 173 million
possible combinations, you could play every number and increase the 
odds of winning to 100 percent and rake in more than 320 percent profit.
(Though, that begs the question: 'If you've got $173 million laying 
around, why are you playing the lottery?')

A lot of lottery players are superstitious and buying tickets on Friday 13th may believe their luck is cursed from the start.

But Matthew Vea, a computer programmer who developed a computer analysis to track Mega Millions winning numbers since 2005, said he has found no pattern - though higher numbers tend to be picked more often.

The Mega Millions lottery is designed to select five balls with numbers 1 through 56 and a sixth ball numbered 1 to 46 at random.

That means, at least in theory, no number combination is more likely to be selected than any other.

However, numbers 48 and 36 have appeared more than any others - about 11 percent of the time.
