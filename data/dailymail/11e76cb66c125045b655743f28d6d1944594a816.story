A British woman who survived a car crash in Croatia that killed her husband and two children has woken from her coma, but has not yet been told her loved ones have died.

Merita Isufi, 34, has been in intensive care in Dubrovnik since the collision on July 31.

Her husband Erion, 37, eldest son Richard, 15, and 14-year-old daughter Ramela, all died in the crash.

Her youngest son Clive, nine, also survived but was severely injured.

Daughter Ramela, 14, pictured with Richard, 15, was also killed in the accident as the family travelled to Albania

Clive was flown to a separate hospital in Split for specialist treatment for a chest injury.

Both he and his mother are expected to make a full recovery, say doctors.

Police
 are looking to obtain a statement from Mrs Isufi, but 
it is understood she is only well enough to have her parents at her 
bedside at present.

A hospital source 
said: 'She is still pretty sick and has certainly not yet been told what
 has happened to her husband and two of her children. 

'It was felt she was too fragile to be told the news just yet.'

It is believed the family, from Barking, east London, were travelling to see family in Albania when the accident happened on a coastal road. 

Witnesses said the  car struck a verge at the side of the road and bounced into the path of a truck coming in the opposite direction.

The truck was apparently a vehicle used by the country's road maintenance organisation. The driver of the Croatian truck was not harmed in the crash.

Ramela (pictured) and her older brother, who were both killed, attended a local secondary school in Barking

Neighbours 
of the Isufis told London's Evening Standard they are a 'lovely family' 
who always went on holiday together in the car.

The crash happened on the Adriatic coast road on the way to Dubrovnik and the family were travelling in a BMW 3 series.

A day after the crash, the director of the hospital, Jerko Ferri Certic, said the situation had been 'very difficult' and doctors had been fighting to save their lives.

He said: 'The mother had internal bleeding and a liver injury and we needed to do an urgent operation. The boy had serious injuries to his chest.'

Toys belonging to the children could be seen spilling out of the BMW's boot at the crash scene.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of an incident in Dubrovnik, Croatia and we are in contact with the local authorities.

'We stand ready to provide consulate assistance.'

The accident involving the family's BMW happened on a coastal road in Croatia

It is thought the car hit a verge before swerving in front of a truck, whose driver was not injured in the crash

The road is a key route for tourists heading to their holidays on the Croatian coastline
