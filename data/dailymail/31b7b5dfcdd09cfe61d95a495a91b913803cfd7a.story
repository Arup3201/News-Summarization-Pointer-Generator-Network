Carl Frampton has been offered a huge £1.5million payday to face Scott Quigg in one of the biggest all-British fights in recent memory.

Talks between the two super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill, but Quigg’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, attempted to jolt Frampton’s camp into a July 18 fight in Manchester by offering the biggest cheque of the Northern Irishman’s career to date.

The proposal was made live on television, with Frampton’s team, led by Barry McGuigan’s Cyclone Promotions, given until the end of the week to accept the terms.

It’s a bold move that could see Quigg pocket substantially less Frampton if the pay-per-view purchases do not meet Hearn’s predictions.

But with the fight more than a year in the making a low revenues seems unlikely, although at present there is only a moderate chance Frampton’s camp will accept the terms, having released their own statement to demand further talks.

Quigg said: ‘He called me out on national TV and I saw on Twitter that he apparently said I’m a Sky hype job. Well come and fight the hype job.

‘I respect him as a fighter, he is very good. And I believe he does want the fight and he genuinely believes he will beat me. If he wants the fight then tell his team, the offer is there. I generally believe he wants the fight but we will find out if he actually does – there is £1.5m if he wants it.

‘He has one and a half million reasons to fight me.’

Hearn added: ‘Scott might not get £1.5m. That is not how this offer is working. This offer is us working together to come up with an offer, that we believe Carl Frampton cannot turn down. If it doesn’t do the pay-per-view buys that we anticipate, Scott might get a third of that (£500,000 to Frampton’s £1.5m). We take the risk. Carl does not have to take any risk.’

Hearn and McGuigan met in London a fortnight ago to discuss the bout, as reported by Sportsmail. Those talks ended in stalemate, with Cyclone Promotions insisting on Tuesday that Hearn would have to return to the negotiating table if the fight is to happen.

The statement read: ‘If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.

‘If Matchroom Sport does not want to meet, Carl Frampton will make an optional defence of his IBF world title this summer.’
