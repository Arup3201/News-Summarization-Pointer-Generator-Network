Plans that could see treated sewage water be introduced into London's drinking supply have been backed by two in three people.

Last year Thames Water launched a consultation to look at how they could increase the amount of water they would need in the future as the population increases.

One of the options to ensure the Thames Water area has enough water to go around was to look at schemes such as waste water recycling.

Last year Thames Water launched a consultation to ask customers their thoughts on seeing waste water treated and put back into the mains supply (file picture)  

This would see waste from toilets recycled back into the River Thames, drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go into the mains supply, to flow out from kitchen taps, which is common practice around the world.

And the survey showed that 69 per cent of the people who responded to the section 'Making sure there's enough water to go round' supported the idea of recycling waste water as 'the right plan to follow'.

This is despite some customers voicing their concerns about the option of treated sewage being in drinking supplies.

The company has already set up a test plant in Enfield, north London, which is experimenting with the toilet waste recycling method.

The survey showed that 69 per cent of people agreed that Thames Water should look into waste water recycling (file picture) 

However, a Thames Water spokesman said there are no definite plans as yet to implement the scheme.

The scheme could see waste water from toilets recycled back into the River Thames, drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go drink 

He said: 'This waste water re-use we are asking for our customers views on is not something we are planning to implement any time soon.

'This is something we see as a longer-term measure and if implemented at all it would be in 2025.'

The survey was prompted after estimates that the population of London and the Thames Valley could move towards ten million people.

The firm say that unless action is taken, there could be a water deficit of around 125 million litres per day by next year.

Other options people backed were installing water meters in homes and businesses as well as bringing in water from other parts of the country at times of drought.

Today, a Thames Water spokesman added: 'In summer 2013, we published our draft proposals for how we will maintain and improve the services we provide to our customers for the five years from 2015 to 2020.

'Our draft five-year plan provides a summary of the work we believe is required between 2015 and 2020 to ensure we continue to provide high-quality water and sewerage services across London and the Thames Valley.

'We held an eight-week consultation and spoke to over 5,000 people at 22 road show events across our supply area, encouraging them give us their views and discussing our plans.

'Over 2,700 customers visited our 'Have your say' website, and nearly 400 of them used our interactive tool to see how the proposals could affect bills.'
