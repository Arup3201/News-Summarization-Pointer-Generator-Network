An estate which has been home to one of England’s most famous aristocrat families for centuries is in 'severe financial difficulties', a court has heard.

Trustees of the Savernake Estate near Marlborough, Wiltshire - home to the Earl of Cardigan - told of the 'urgency of the situation' at a High Court hearing in London.

Lawyers gave details of the estate’s cash problems during a dispute over the ownership of about 40 paintings of the earl’s ancestors.

Trustees want to sell the paintings but the earl - David Brudenell-Bruce, 59 - objects.

He claims that he is entitled to 'use of the paintings' under the terms of a lease and wants to stop trustees selling them.

Trustees dispute his claim and say the paintings are not part of the lease.

Mr Justice Newey was given an insight into the background to the dispute in written legal submissions prepared by lawyers representing trustees.

'This dispute arose because of the estate’s severe financial difficulties,' said Penelope Reed QC, for the trustees, in the written submissions. 'The trustees urgently need to sell the paintings.'

She said a question the judge had to decide was whether estate 'chattels' - which included paintings, silver and furniture - were 'vested in the trustees' or part of a lease granted to the earl.

The earl’s name is renowned because of the part played by an ancestor in one of the most famous attacks in military history - the Charge of the Light Brigade.

Details can be found on the Savernake Estate website, which explains: 'In 1854, during the Crimean War, a very distant cousin of the Savernake Forest family was told that his commander-in-chief had ordered him and his men to mount a cavalry charge on some distant Russian cannons.

'Though he naturally queried the written order, he was again ordered to carry it out, which he reluctantly did - and so James, Earl of Cardigan and his Light Brigade passed into famous history.'

The website says the estate is set in Savernake Forest, between Marlborough and Hungerford, and is privately owned by the earl and family trustees.

It says the 4,500-acre woodland is the only privately-owned forest in Britain.

An estate history on the website says Savernake Forest 'cannot be less than 1,000 years old' and is referred to in a Saxon charter from King Athelstan in 934AD and called Safernoc.

The website says there were four buildings called Tottenham House on the southern edge of the forest. The present stately home was built in 1820, it adds.

It says the family lived in Tottenham House until 1940. After the Second World War ended, they moved to a smaller house on the estate.

The earl told the judge earlier in the hearing that the Savernake Estate had been in his family for '31 generations, for 1,000 years'.

He said his 'every waking thought' centred on how he could preserve the estate for the 'next generation'.
