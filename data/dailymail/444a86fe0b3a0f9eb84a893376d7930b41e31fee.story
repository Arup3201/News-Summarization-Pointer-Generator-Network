Arjen Robben has been ruled out of Holland's games against Turkey and Spain with a torn abdominal muscle.

The Bayern Munich forward was substituted in the first half of his club's Bundesliga 2-0 defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday and the Dutch Football Federation (KNVB) has now confirmed his absence.

A statement on the KNVB's official website read: 'Arjen Robben has informed national coach Guus Hiddink of his withdrawal for the upcoming matches of the Dutch team against Turkey and Spain.

'Hiddink will decide at a later stage if he will call up a replacement for the injured Robben.'

Bayern revealed on their website after the game that Robben would be out for 'several weeks', and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: 'This news is at least as bad as the defeat.'

Holland face Turkey on Saturday in European Championship qualifying group A, where they lie third behind the Czech Republic and Iceland after losing two of their first four games. 

Spain then visit the Amsterdam ArenA for a friendly on Tuesday.
