Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen are facing a slew of federal corruption charges, but as they appeared in court for the first time today, reports emerged that the Republican politician once rejected a plea deal that would have spared his wife entirely.

They pleaded not guilty and federal Magistrate David Novak released them without bond on Friday, but ordered them not to leave the country.

The McDonnells' lawyer said in court that his clients have already surrendered their passports. Trial was set for July 28.

The McDonnells were charged Tuesday with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the head of Star Scientific, a health supplement company, and then bolstering the company's image through the prestige of Virginia's top political official.

But most of that money flowed to Mrs McDonnell in the form of expensive clothes, and gifts that she later gave her husband.

Among the items that the McDonnells may have to return - all listed in a federal government's 14-count indictment - are a silver Rolex engraved watch, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones, two Oscar de la Renta dresses and Louis Vuitton merchandise including shoes, a purse and a wallet.

Mr McDonnell, the first Virginia governor ever to face a criminal indictment, insists that he has done nothing wrong, and his attorney paints a picture of a governor blindsided by his wife's poor judgment.

The indictment includes an email she sent to one of the governor's senior staffers, explaining why she accepted one of the Oscar de la Renta gowns from Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams.

'I need to talk to you about Inaugural clothing budget,' she wrote. 'I need answers and Bob is screaming about the thousands I’m charging up in credit card debt.'

'We are broke, have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already, and this Inaugural is killing us! I need answers and I need help, and I need to get this done.'

Gov McDonnell could be preparing a defense the would essentially blame his wife for all of the gifts - which could get both of them off the hook, since she didn't wield official power

The ex-governor has held fast to his insistence that he's innocent.

'I did nothing illegal for Mr Williams in exchange for what I believed was his personal generosity and friendship,' Mr McDonnell said Tuesday in a statement.

'I never promised – and Mr Williams and his company never received – any government benefit of any kind from me or my administration. We did not violate the law, and I will use every available resource and advocate I have for as long as it takes to fight these false allegations, and to prevail against this unjust overreach of the federal government.'

He later said in a televised statement that 'I come before you this evening as someone who's been falsely and wrongly accused.'

The plea agreement Mr McDonnell rejected last year, according to the Washington Post, would have required him to acknowledge only that he filed an incomplete mortgage application when he failed to list money he had borrowed from Mr Williams.

For Mr McDonnell, once considered a possible presidential running mate in 2012, a political future hinges on a complete exoneration.

Maureen McDonnell wrote in emails that she was worried about money and affording new clothes in her position as First Lady - which accounted for the designer gifts

So he refused to take the deal, which would have spared him and his family any public hint of corruption charges.

But now he and his wife face serious criminal counts that allege a conspiracy to trade his official influence for valuable gifts – and for the loans that kept his house from slipping away.

The McDonnells are a rarity in US politics, a political family without wealth. Their attorney is reportedly preparing a legal strategy that will lean on Mrs McDonnell and lay most of the blame for their interactions with Mr Williams at her feet.

While that may sound callous, it would likely clear both of any criminal wrongdoing, since a governor's wife doesn't technically have the official power to help generous donors or gift-givers.

'It’s almost like ships passing in the night. Where he says, "I didn’t know what she was doing." And she says, "I had no idea what he was doing,"' former federal prosecutor Jonathan Biran told the Washington Post. 'And the jury is left to decide what’s reasonable. It's an interesting wrinkle.'

If it's determined that the governor himself was unaware of the extent to which Mr Williams was opening his wallet to subsidize his wife's expensive tastes, he'll be off the hook – and Republicans will be able to crow that his prosecution was ham-fisted and politically motivated.

Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the governorship in November, beating Ken Cuccinelli, McDonnell's state Attorney General. Virginia's top three offices – governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general – are all in Democratic hands at the same time, something that hasn't happened since 1989.
