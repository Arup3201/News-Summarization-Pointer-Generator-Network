Â 

When the first screenshots of Infinity Blade appeared for iPhone, gamers were quick to dimiss them as fakes.

But not only was the swords-and-sorcery game real, it went on to become a $10 million-selling hit - the fastest-selling iPhone game ever.

The sequel, Infinity Blade 2, comes out today for both iPhone and iPad - and looks set to accelerate a trend that has seen Sony and Nintendo's portable-gaming market share plunge from 91 per cent two years ago to just 42 per cent now.

The game will only run on phones with Apple's new fast A5 processors - found in iPhone 4S and iPad 2

The original Infinity Blade was the fastest-selling game ever on Apple's IPhone. The sequel adds faster-paced, more complex combat

Magic spells are created by 'drawing' a rune on screen: The game's success was at least partially due to the fact it was BUILT for touchscreens, rather than a normal game

The game only works on handsets with the fast A5 processor - the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 - hence the top-end 3D graphics, created by Epic Games, also behind console hits such as Gears of War 3.

On review-aggregator site Metacritic, its average score is 95 per cent.

TouchArcade said, 'We put incredibly powerful devices in our pockets and on our laps daily, but rarely do we see games that utterly embrace this like Infinity Blade has. It's a showcase piece; a technically and visually gifted game that consistently delivers eye-popping stuff.'

Like the first game, it's built to be controlled by touchscreen - you swipe and parry across the screen, and unleash magical spells by drawing runes.

It's also almost certain to be followed by money-spinning expansions: the last game had four.

The game is accompanied by a book by fantasy author Brandon Sanderson.

The range of beasts to battle has expanded - but the basic combat system is still a simple matter of hitting buttons in time

The game will expand on the plot of the first one - which had a rather cryptic ending revealing that the God-King who you battled may not be a villain at alll...

The game now features a crossbow-wielding heroine, Asian locations - and an even more cryptic plot.

'The continuing journey of young Siris unfolds as you delve deeper into the world of the Deathless tyrants and their legion of Titans,' say the game's markers.

'Can you unlock all the mysteries and successfully wield the power of the Infinity Blade in this timeless adventure of champions and villains?'
