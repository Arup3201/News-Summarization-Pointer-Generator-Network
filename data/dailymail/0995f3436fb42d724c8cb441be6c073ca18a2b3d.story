A homeless man has been arrested for allegedly breaking into a Georgia funeral home and having sex with a woman's body.

Domonique Smith, 26, was arrested on Monday when he was found with a bike stolen from the Hill Watson Peoples Funeral Service in Columbus during a burglary. 

Further investigation revealed that a body of a dead woman had been disturbed when the burglary occurred on December 29, police said.

'The results of our investigation and the forensic examination gave us probable cause to believe that this individual had indeed sexually assaulted a dead body,' said Columbus Police Major Gil Slouchick. 

Smith matched the description of a suspect in the crime, police said.

Captain Gordon Griswould said that Smith was found in a vacant home with other stolen property, including TVs and guns, according to the Ledger-Inquirer.

Investigations revealed that a body of a female victim had been sexually assaulted during the December burglary of the Hill Watson Peoples Funeral Service (pictured).  Smith matched the description of a suspect in the crime, police said.

He would not comment on the alleged sexual act nor would he identify the victim, but he said the family has been informed of the charges and ongoing police investigation. 

Griswould added that necrophilia charges were 'extremely rare' in Columbus.  

Smith pleaded guilty to burglary, entering an unoccupied dwelling, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and theft by receiving stolen property, according to the newspaper. He is currently in jail.

It's unclear if Smith has an attorney. He is expected to appear in court on the necrophilia charge Monday.

If convicted, he could serve up to ten years for necrophilia.
