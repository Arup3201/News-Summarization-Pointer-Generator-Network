Calorie counters can throw caution to the wind this Easter with a specially created cocktail made of Cadbury's Creme Eggs.

The indulgent Creme Egg mojito - which blends rum and chocolate liqueur with the smashed-up milk chocolate and fondant treats - contains a whopping 987 calories; more than a double cheeseburger and fries washed down with a small Coke.

Despite the belt-busting calorie content, the barman who created the £8.50 Easter cocktail insists it is 'surprisingly light' and 'refreshing'.

'Surprisingly light': The mojito blends smashed up Creme Eggs with rum and chocolate liqueur, and is garnished with a sprig of mint and yet another Creme Egg

Indulgent: The £8.50 Creme Egg mojito contains a staggering 987 calories - more than a double cheeseburger and fries washed down with a small full-fat Coke

Jack Williams, a mixologist for bar owners Late Night London, came up with the sweet treat for the Jewel Bar in Piccadilly Circus.

'This is the ultimate in Easter treats - boozy, refreshing and deathly chocolatey,' he said.

'It's surprisingly light, not like the heavy chocolate milkshake cocktails you sometimes find.

Cheers! Drinkers who treat themselves to a Creme Egg mojito over Easter could burn off the calories by cycling uphill for an hour of skipping for an hour and 20 minutes

'To make it, just bruise a mint sprig and put it in the bottom of the glass with the rum and chocolate liqueur.

 A host of indulgent treats come at a lower calorific cost than the 987 found in a single Creme Egg mojito:

'Then add the sugar syrup and lime juice to the mix, add some crushed ice and smashed up chocolate egg and stir it all together.

'Finally, top with a little more crushed ice, a dash of soda on top and serve with a half of the Creme Egg,' said Mr Williams.

Drinkers who do indulge in a Creme Egg mojito over the bank holiday would need to cycle uphill at pace for around one hour in order to burn off the calories.

Alternatively they could skip for an hour and 20 minutes, or swim continuously for an hour using the butterfly stroke.

Rory Spicer, manager at Jewel bar said he expected to be busy with Easter drinkers over the weekend.

Mr Spicer said: 'Our cocktail experts are so good at what they do, we like to throw the odd special mojito into the mix along with our usual favourites.

'With Easter coming up, someone asked if we'd be doing anything special and that's when Jack suggested we try this Creme Egg recipe.

'The regulars who have had a sneaky taste can't wait for the Easter weekend when they'll be able to have as many as they like.

'It'll be fun to make, fun to serve up to customers and should make for an cracking Easter all round.'

The Creme Egg mojito will be served on Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Sunday and costs £8.50.
