Human remains have been found along an Alaskan trail less than two miles from the home of a family of four who disappeared without a trace last May.

Brandon Jividen, 38, his girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23, her two children Michelle, 6, and three-year-old Jarraca and their dog Sparks have not been seen for 10 months, prompting massive police searches with help from the FBI.

Now police in the Alaskan town of Kenai, are connecting the discovery of the remains and items of clothing with the family's disappearance.

It comes after a person driving down a west Kenai trail on Saturday spotted items, which were reported missing from Miss Adams and Mr Jividen's home.

 FBI officials are travelling to the area to help with the investigation.

Currently yellow crime scene tape has cordoned off a brown, wooded area the size of a football field and police SUVs and a forensics tent has been erected.

Police added that it would take time to positively identify the remains and to complete the investigation.

Lieutenant David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where they have gone or where they might be.

'The investigation does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into the investigation of the missing persons.'

He refused to revealed specific details of the investigation but said that the main search area was woodland close to the family home on California Street.

The family, along with their pet dog, were last seen on May 27 last year with relatives saying it appeared that they had left their home without packing.

Their two vehicles remained parked outside their apartment and their rent for June had not been paid.

Also missing were Adams' children, Michelle Hundley, 6, and Jaracca Hundley, 3

The family were reported missing on June 5, after a neighbor contacted police to report that the family home appeared to have been lying empty.

Miss Adams sister, Lanell Adams said that the young mother had been 'very distressed' during a phone call in the week before she went missing.

Miss Adams who travelled to Alaska from Washington State to look for her sister, said: 'She sounded very distressed. She just told me: "Know that I love you" and that she had to get off the phone very quickly.

'Growing up we always had this thing, we say "Thou shall not lie'' and you always have to tell the truth.

'I asked her, ''Thou shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?'' She said, ''Don't ask me that right now. Just know that I love you.'"

Meanwhile her uncle Dennis Giffords told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'You have a shred of hope that they will be found. And that shred has been taken away.'

Kenai is a city of 7,100 about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage at the mouth of the Kenai River, Alaska's most popular sport fishing attraction.
