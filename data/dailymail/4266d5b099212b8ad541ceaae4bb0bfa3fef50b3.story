Killer: A handwritten suicide note was found on the body of John Zawahri, 23, after he killed five people in Santa Monica last week

A gunman who shot and killed five people last week in Santa Monica left a three-page suicide note apologising for murdering his father and brother.

Detectives revealed the letter was found on  the body of John Zawahri after he was shot dead by police following the rampage last Friday.

It also emerged the assault-style 
rifle carried by the 23-year-old had been assembled out of component 
parts he ordered from out of state.

Investigators are seeking to 
determine whether Zawahri, who had tried but failed to buy a weapon in 
2011, assembled the gun himself or had someone else do it for him.

The handwritten suicide note apologised for killing his father and older brother, who 
were found shot to death in their home by firefighters called to put out
a fire that engulfed part of the house.

Santa Monica police spokesman Sergeant Richard Lewis said the note also bid 
goodbye to friends and expressed hope that his mother, who was estranged
from Zawahri's father and was out of the country at the time of the 
killings, would be provided for financially.

But the 
letter offered no explanation for why Zawahri killed his father and 
brother or went on the subsequent shooting spree through the seaside 
town west of Los Angeles that left three other people dead at Santa 
Monica College.

'It was a farewell letter, basically, apologizing
for what he did to his brother and his dad, and hoping that his mother 
would be taken care of. That's it,' Lewis said.

He made no 
mention in the letter of marital strife known to have existed between 
his parents or any other problems, nor did he express any anger, Lewis 
said.

Police also revealed the former 
part-time college student had also converted a vintage .44-caliber 
black-powder handgun into a .45-caliber revolver that he carried with 
him last week.

Weapon: This Colt 45 was also seized by police officers who killed John Zawahri after he shot five people dead

Murder: This Colt pistol was another of the weapons seized by detectives

Police added that Zawahri had tried to purchase a weapon in 2011 but was denied permission by the California Department of Justice in a form letter recovered after last week's shootings.

Police have yet to determine why Zawahri was denied the purchase or what kind of gun he had tried to acquire.

Even though the semi-automatic rifle wielded by Zawahri was assembled from component parts, it was illegal under California's strict gun laws.

California has banned the purchase and 
possession of assault-style weapons unless they were acquired by the 
owner before June 1989.

Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks, in a news conference called by police to disclose new details of the investigation, also said investigators believe mental illness was a factor in Zawahri's outburst of gun violence.

Police previously have cited an encounter they say Zawahri had with law enforcement as a juvenile in which he was taken into custody and placed under a 72-hour 'psychiatric hold' in 2006, when he would have been 16 or 17 years old..

Identified: Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, left, was one of 4 victims of the Santa Monica College shooting spree Friday. Franco's daughter Marcela, 25, remains on life support

Family tragedy: Mr Franco, pictured left and right with his daughter,Â  was fatally wounded and crashed the car he was driving into a wall

Happier times: Franco (far right), pictured here with his family, was the driver of a red Ford Explorer that the gunman sprayed with bullets

California law allows police to 
involuntarily confine a person for up to three days in the psychiatric 
unit of a hospital if that individual is deemed a danger to oneself or 
others or is 'gravely disabled'.

The
incident seven years ago resulted in police being called to his 
family's home, but the circumstances surrounding the incident have not 
been disclosed by police.
