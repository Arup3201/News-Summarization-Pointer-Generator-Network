Internet trolls have launched a hate campaign against Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell, who is accused of child sex offences, comparing him to paedophile Jimmy Savile.

The 48-year-old actor faces charges including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity with a child at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

Now internet bullies have created pictures of him, mocking him up as the late DJ and prolific child abuser.

Michael Le Vell has become the target of online bullies who have created photos of him comparing him to paedophile Jimmy Savile

There is a false advert pretending that he has been axed from the soap opera, and another picture shows him with other celebrities who have been accused of sex offences, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter.

Users have shared the vicious photographs and comments with others, as the actor said he would 'vigorously deny' the charges brought against him.

Now police are looking into the pictures to see if they break the law, the Daily Star reported.

The images could be seen as contempt of court - which would hamper an individual's right to a fair trial.

Le Vell, a divorced father of two, plays mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, but has recently said he fears he will not be allowed to return even if he is found innocent.

Police say they are looking into the images, which could be in contempt of court, which preserves the individual's right to a fair trial

The ITV1 actor 'vigorously denies' the charges that have been brought against him

The alleged sex offences all relate to one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told in February.

The actor was first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale in September 2011 after a girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her.

But three months later, after a police investigation, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take the allegations to court.

But last month it was announced that after a review of the evidence, he had been charged with 19 sex offences.

In a statement Le Vell said he would fight the allegations 'vigorously'.

He appeared at Manchester Magistrates Court to hear the charges and was bailed on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 14.

He is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court this month.
