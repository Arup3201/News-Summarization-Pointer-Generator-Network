‘I am a bit embarrassed still to be talking about it 43 years on,’ John Motson told me this week, ‘but Ronnie Radford’s goal changed my life. I was effectively on trial in television and, to tell you the truth, I am not sure I had pulled up too many trees up to that point.

‘The match was meant to be a formality, which is why I was given it, but it changed into an unforgettable national occasion.

‘I watched it later with fish and chips at (Hereford striker) Billy Meadows’s house.’  

Ronnie Radford’s famous goal against Newcastle in the FA Cup changed John Motson's life

‘What a goal, what a goal,’ exclaimed Motson. ‘Radford the scorer. Ronnie Radford.’ The hero, wearing No 11, reeled away, both hands in the air.

Boys in green parkas and grown men waving black-and-white scarves flooded on to the muddy turf, where, in extra time, substitute Ricky George hit Hereford’s winner low into the far corner. The Southern League no-hopers had done it. 

Colin Addison, player-manager in 1972, still brings that team together for reunions. ‘They say I’m their No 13,’ jokes Motson.

Three years ago on the 40th anniversary of the historic win, the FA Cup was brought to Hereford and paraded through the city. Pictures of the reunited team, complete with Motson wearing a shin-length sheepskin coat, are displayed in a glass cabinet in the Green Dragon Hotel foyer.

Radford, a carpenter who has retired to his native Yorkshire, returns to Hereford occasionally. ‘Every time the response is absolutely fantastic — the same today as it was then,’ he said. ‘The supporters feel it as much as the players because they were as much part of it as we were. We couldn’t have done it without them.

‘It will never be forgotten. Giantkilling, from a long time back to a long time to come, is what the FA Cup is all about.’

Radford points out that the 1972 win over Newcastle in a third-round replay was only one of many glorious FA Cup moments in tiny Hereford’s history. They have since beaten West Ham, drawn with Arsenal and Tottenham and lost narrowly to Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United.

Hereford were already making history back in 1952. Their 0-0 draw with London amateurs Leyton was reputedly the first FA Cup game, other than the final, to be broadcast live. 

Radford has watched spellbound the FA Cup feats of Warrington Town and Cambridge United this season. It is all part of the romance of world football’s oldest knockout competition, an institution which the late Geoffrey Green, of The Times, said, was ‘the spark that set the whole bonfire of football alight.’
