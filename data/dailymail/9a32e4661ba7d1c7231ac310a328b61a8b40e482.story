Ahmad Otak appeared at Wakefield Magistrates' Court this morning charged with their murders

An 18-year-old man appeared in court today accused of murdering two women who were found stabbed in a flat.

Kimberley Frank, 17, and Samantha Sykes, 18, were discovered at the flat in Barden Road in the Eastmoor area of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday morning.

Ahmad Otak appeared at Wakefield Magistrates’ Court this morning charged with their murders.

Otak, of Wakefield, is also accused of the kidnap and false imprisonment of Miss Frank’s sister, Elisa Frank, and possession of a large kitchen knife.

Otak appeared in the dock wearing a blue sweatshirt and flanked by two security guards.

He spoke only to confirm his address and date of birth during the brief hearing.

Reading out the details of the charges, the court clerk said: 'You are charged with a total of five matters.'

He told the court that Otak was charged with the murders of Kimberley and Miss Sykes at the flat in Barden Road on March 9.

The clerk continued: 'Between 9 and 11
March of this year, at locations within the UK, it is alleged you 
assaulted and unlawfully imprisoned Elisa Frank and detained her against
her will.

'Between 9 and 11 March this year, you unlawfully by force or fraud took or carried away Elisa Frank against her will.'

The clerk said Otak was also charged 
with possessing 'without good reason an article which had a blade, 
namely a large kitchen knife'.

Killed: Samantha Sykes was found dead after police were alerted by a woman 250 miles away

Magistrate Lynda Hammond told Otak he would be remanded in custody to appear before Leeds Crown Court by video-link tomorrow.

Yesterday, bunches of flowers could be seen on the steps to the flats and cards had been attached to the handrail.

One bouquet had a card, which read: 
'Sammy, we will miss you sooo much. You were a great friend and will 
never ever be forgotten. We'll see you again one day. RIP.'

West Yorkshire Police said officers 
were contacted by Kent Police after a 19-year-old woman in Dover raised 
concerns for the safety of the two women.

A police cordon is in place and officers stand guard at the flat where the bodies were found

Officers went to the flat in Barden 
Road and discovered the bodies of Miss Frank and Miss Sykes, of 
California Drive, Horbury, West Yorkshire.

A post-mortem examination revealed the women died from stab wounds.

Miss
Frank, who spent a large part of her life in care, had lived alone in 
the ground floor flat in the Eastmoor area of Wakefield since moving in 
two months ago.

Miss Sykes lived with her parents and younger brother, Ben, in a more affluent area of the town.
Her parents, Eric and Julie, have been too upset to speak.
