A young New York hotel heir was found dead from a likely drug overdose Sunday evening in his posh Manhattan highrise, with methamphetamine, cocaine and the party drug GHB reportedly at his side.

Charlie Denihan, a management trainee at his family's Denihan Hospitality Group, was one of three suspected drug-related deaths in just four hours in the area.

The drug GHB was found near all the victims and police fear that a bad batch of the drug could be making the rounds.

The New York Post reports that the handsome heir's roommate discovered the body around 7:30pm Sunday.

Denihan's family owns some of New York's finest hotels, including the James in Soho, the Surrey on the Upper East Side, and the Mansfield near Bryant Park.

As an up-and-comer in the hotel game, Denihan seemed to have everything going for him. He also had a flourishing social life as proved by the many party photos on his social media feeds.

He even dated gorgeous socialite Jules Kirby and appeared on Tinsley Mortimer's reality series.

But his promising life was cut tragically short and police say his wasn't the only death from GHB in the area that night.

Four hours after Denihan's body was discovered, the other two victims were found.

These men, 34-year-old Shaun Murphy and 37-year-old Jovin Raithz, were also found with GHB.

Police don't know if the three men knew each other, but they're testing the GHB to figure if it came from the same batch, the Post reports.

Now, as authorities try to ensure that the potentially tainted drug claims no more victims, the Denihan family begins to mourn the death of one of their own.

'We are devastated at the tragic and sudden loss of Charlie,' reads the family's statement. 'He was a loving and remarkable son, brother, nephew, cousin, Godfather and friend. In this tragic time, we ask that you remember him in your prayers and respect our privacy as we mourn his passing.'
