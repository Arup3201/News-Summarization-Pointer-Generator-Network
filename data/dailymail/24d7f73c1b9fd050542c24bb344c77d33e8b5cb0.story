Delaware has announced it has its first confirmed Obamacare enrollee on Tuesday, over two weeks after the program’s roll-out.

Department of Health and Social Service officials have declared Janice Baker, 59, of Selbyville the first confirmed resident to enroll in the marketplace.

Baker says she faced challenges along the way and even spent seven hours on the computer and phone, but she’s confident it was all well worth it.

‘I started looking right at October 1,’ Baker, who runs a dog kennel, told the News Journal.

That’s when Obamacare marketplaces opened across the country. It’s also when potential enrollees nationwide began experiencing system glitches, both online and on the phone.

‘I had made several attempts online to enroll and activate my membership,’ Baker said. ‘I could not get in to save my life.’

More affordable: Baker, right, will pay $700 a month for her new insurance plan, saving her around $1800 per year

She then called an 800 number, but after an hour and a half the representative’s computer locked up.

When she called again, the same thing happened.

Days later, after Baker followed a tip found on the healthcare.gov site suggesting users clear their computers’ browsing history, cookies and other temporary data, she was able to complete the process.

‘Right after that, I was able to apply,’ Baker said. ‘It might not be the government computers, it may be your own sitting in front of you.’

Baker told the News Journal she's grateful for her new insurance plan after having been turned down several companies due to a pre-existing condition.

'I was thrilled to be able to have this happen,' she said. 'This is so much better than the policy before. I was very impressed.'

Though she declined to go into detail about the plan she chose, Baker said she'll now be paying $700 per month for her health insurance.

While acknowledging the system’s problems, secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services Rita Landgraf said that many of the glitches have been fixed and that the process is becoming smoother.

Delaware made headlines last week as reports emerged that the state had yet to log a single enrollee.

Baker has now changed that. 

‘My thought is now that we have Janice, we’re going to see more and more people successfully getting through the screens and getting through the enrollment,’ said Landgraf.

Baby steps: Delaware's announcement comes after headlines shamed the state for not having a single enrollee as of last week and over two week's after Obamacare's widely criticized and glitchy roll-out October 1
