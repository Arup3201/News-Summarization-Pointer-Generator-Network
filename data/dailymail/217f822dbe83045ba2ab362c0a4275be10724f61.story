Two Los Angeles police detectives have survived a 'blatant assassination attempt' after they were fired on as they drove into the parking lot of their police station early this morning.

The two officers returned fire, resulting in a furious gun battle in which at least a dozen rounds were fired. Both detectives escaped with only minor injuries and were back on duty by Tuesday afternoon.

More than 200 LAPD officers are currently hunting for the suspects in the Mid-City neighborhood of Los Angeles and Chief Charlie Beck has ordered security stepped up and police precincts across the city.

Hunt: More than 200 officers fanned out in the Mid-City neighborhood of Los Angeles in a massive manhunt for the shooting suspects

Four men were detained during the search - though three were later released. The fourth is still being questioned

According to the Los Angeles Times, Beck had strong words for the shooters who opened fire on his officers, who were returning back to their station house after investigating a burglary. 

In a press conference, he called the attack 'a blatant attempt to assassinate two of the people who protect this community.'

The targeting of two LAPD officers comes less than five months after rouge LAPD officer Christopher Dorner put every police officer in Southern California on edge after publicly swearing to seek revenge for his firing from the department.

He killed four police officers and the daughter of a police captain during a two-week reign of terror in February. His rampage ended in a remote cabin near Bear Lake, California, when he shot himself in the head after being surrounded by SWAT officers.

Tuesday's ambush took place about 4.30am as the two detectives, who specialize in investigating burglaries, were pulled into the parking lot of the LAPD’s Wilshire substation.

The two officers had been working on a case and were returning to their offices when they were fired on in their squad car.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies also joined the search for the suspects

'(The gunmen) knew that these were police officers or police employees,' LAPD Commander Andy Smith 
said.

'Anybody willing to take on two police officers outside a police 
station is obviously a dangerous individual.'

The officers returned fire, but failed to hit the suspects.

One officer was wounded in the hand. The other was wounded in the head - possibly by shattered glass from his car window.

The attack prompted a full-scale response from the LAPD.

More than 200 officers converged on the neighborhood and began searching for the suspects. Every police canine unit in the city responded, plus several police dogs from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

The officers were treated at a hospital and released hours later. Beck said they, too, had joined in the

Despite the massive response, the search turned out to be fruitless.

By Tuesday night, no suspects had been found.

Beck ordered LAPD officers posted outside of the department headquarters and at every precinct station as a precaution.

Officers were visible outside the department's downtown headquarters on Tuesday night.
