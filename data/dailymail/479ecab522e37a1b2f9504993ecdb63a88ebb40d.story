She was thrust into the spotlight by Big Brother, became a celebrity overnight and appeared to be constantly in the media headlights until her tragic death from cervical cancer at age 27.

Now Jade Goody's life - one that everybody seemed to have an opinion on - will be played out in an opera.

The contemporary style performance, written by Afsaneh Gray, takes a close look at Jade Goody's life as a study of modern day 'celebrity'.

Tragic: The public celebrity life of Jade Goody, pictured signing copies of her autobiography 'Catch A Falling Star', is the focus of a new opera playing in August

Jade, pictured left in May 2006 posing for the launch of her TV show Just Jade, and right, once she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer, had a life that was played out 'in a theatrical way' in the media, said opera director Pia Furtado

Speaking to the Mail Online, Ms Gray said she was inspired to write an opera on Jade while working in an office as medical secretary.

She said women in the office were constantly pouring over Jade Goody's life as it was splashed across gossip magazines, and everybody always had an opinion on it.

Some ranged from support for the Big Brother star, others were less compassionate and far more critical accusing her of being 'racist' from her various public outbursts.

Realising the strength of feeling 
people had on such public figures, Ms Gray decided to write an opera on 
'celebrity' and focus on the tragic life of Jade.

'I like to do things that have some kind of contemporary resonance,' she said.

Jade's relationship with Jack Tweed was also a public affair. Following numerous allegations of Tweed being unfaithful the pair broke up, but they later rekindled their relationship

'It's important it's not just about Jade Goody, it's about celebrity.'

Ms Gray worked with composer Erick Flores over three-and-a-half years to produce the final production.

They named the opera, 'and the Crowd (wept)' and were keen to highlight that Jade's name did not appear in the title.

Together, they decided that Jade would be played by three people, all on stage at the same time, showing the different sides of the star, performed in the first person as well as the various ways she was perceived in the media.

The three Jades, who sing a 'Jade chorus', are played by Cathy Bell, Sarah Minns and Norah King. Throughout the opera it is also narrated in a 'fairy-tale like way', by David Hansford.

Jade's tragic story captured the hearts of people across the country and her funeral saw well-wishers throw flowers at her hearse during the procession through Loughton Essex

Director Pia Furtado, who has worked on pieces performed by Opera North and the Royal Opera, told the Mail Online she was drawn to the production because of the contemporary and challenging style of the show.

She said: 'I think new opera is always
interesting because you're trying to find new voices and (doing) work 
that's responding to something very current.'

Ms
Furtado says compared with traditional opera, you are working with 
contemporary stories and issues, as opposed to trying to layer 
contemporary ideas over traditional operas.

She said of Jade: 'What a fascinating character whose life was played out in such an already-theatrical way.'

Jade shot into the limelight in 2002 when she appeared on the third series of Big Brother. Her new fame led to her own TV programmes and the launch of her own products.

While the outspoken Big Brother 
housemate found herself a new career through the show, it also saw her 
voted as one of the 100 WorstÂ  Britons, in a Channel 4 production.

As the poster highlights, left, the opera tells the story of Jade Goody's life from three perspectives, from the first person and from various media archives. Writer Afsaneh Gray, right, says she got the idea for the opera while working 
in an office and listening to everyone's different opinions about the Big 
Brother star

Things went downhill for Jade when she was accused of being 'racist' on a subsequent Celebrity Big Brother show. She made public apologies to Indian actress Shilpa Shetty once she was booted out of the house, and the next year appeared in a version of India's Big Brother.

But the star withdrew early from the August 2008 show after being told she had cervical cancer - a disease that would eventually kill her less than a year later.

While her roller coaster life was played out in such a public way in the media, people across the country reacted to it in different ways.

Ms
Furtado said of the opera: 'What's interesting about this particular piece was not about her life but how it was consumed and how people reacted to it.'

The narration describes how young Jade always had fairytale dreams of stardom, but the tragedy is that her heavenly desires did not turn out how she had dreamt.

'and the Crowd (wept)' will be performed over two nights, on August 1 and 2, at the Tete a Tete opera festival, at London's Riverside Studios in west London.
