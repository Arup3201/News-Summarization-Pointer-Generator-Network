The missing 7th Earl of Lucan, at a reception in July 1971. His brother is 'sure' he fled to Africa after the murder

The brother of Lord Lucan has broken his silence to reveal he thinks the famous fugitive vanished to Africa and might still be alive.

Hugh Bingham said he was 'sure' the elusive aristocrat fled to start a new life after murdering his children's nanny Sandra Rivett, 29, in Belgravia, south west London in 1974.

Theories regarding the elusive earl, who would now be 76, have been numerous and far-fetched over the 38 years he has been missing and he has been reportedly spotted in countries like South Africa, Australia and Ireland.

When Mr Bingham was asked if he thought his brother had escaped to 
Africa, he said: 'I'm sure he did, yes. But what connection there is I 
don't know'.

But Mr Bingham moved to South Africa to escape 
the media glare after his brother vanished and now lives in 
Johannesburg.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said he didn't want to speculate on where his brother is or was and whether he was dead or alive.

Mr Bingham, who apparently bears a striking resemblance to Lucan, said the last contact he had with him was before the murder.

Many police officers involved in the case believe he fled the country with the help of his wealthy friends. Others have suggested he committed suicide but no body has ever been found.

However, Lord Lucan's wife Lady Veronica Lucan, believes her husband died the day after the murder by jumping off a ferry.

The 72-year-old widow, who lives as a
virtual recluse at her home in London, rubbished claims he fled to 
Africa saying 'it does not make sense'.

She said he was 'not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad', adding 
that he couldn't speak foreign languages and 'preferred English food.'

The
revelations follow a BBC report on Inside Out this week where a former personal 
assistant to Lucan’s friend, casino-owner and zoo-keeper John Aspinall, 
claimed that not only was the peer living in Africa in the early 
Eighties, but he also saw his children on at least two occasions.

The
woman, named in the programme as Jill Findlay, says she arranged travel
tickets for Lucan’s eldest two children to travel to Kenya and then to 
Gabon, where ‘their father would observe them... just to see how they 
were growing up’.

Lucan was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999

The British aristocrat was famously smuggled out of the country following the death of Sandra Rivett - the family's nanny - in 1974.

Lucan, born Richard John Bingham in 1934, was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999.

He started gambling early in life and learned how to play poker during his national service years.

In 1955, he got a job with a small merchant bank, William Brandts, for £500 a year.

However, he retired in 1960 having won £26,000 over two nights playing 'chemin de fer' at a gambling party run by John Aspinall.

But he would eventually accrue huge debts, before disappearing following Ms Rivett's death.

Every few years, Lord Lucan is 'spotted' again - sometimes in Australia, sometimes in Africa, sometimes in the UK.

However, Mr Bingham said he had no knowledge of that and admitted he has 'never really been in touch with them'. He said he is often asked to speak about the case but chooses not to.

Lucan had three children with Lady Lucan, Frances, George and Camilla.

Lady Lucan, who lost custody of the children in 1982 following a breakdown, said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest the children went abroad and said she would have known if they had.

She also questioned why the woman claims only Frances and George went abroad and not Camilla.

She said her husband would have wanted to see all three children, whom she is no longer in touch with.

Meanwhile, this week an antiques dealer 
came across what he claims must be Lucan's watch which is believed to 
have come from South Africa.

Cedrick
Lincoln, 58, believes the watch with a chunky black strap which he 
bought last week from another dealer for £5,000 could hold vital clues 
as to what happened to Lucan.

The other dealer claims that it was discovered in a South African township.

Inscribed
on the underside of the watch is the message: 'Presented to Lord 
"Lucky' Lucan" The Old Fossil' by his friends at the Clermont Club 
Mayfair December 1967'.

After some digging, Mr Lincoln found photographs of the aristocrat wearing a similar watch.

The discovery supports claims that the fugitive fled to South Africa, where some believe he is still living.

Sandra Rivett's body was found in the basement of Lucan's Belgravia house

At
9.45pm, Lady Lucan, in great distress, burst into the Plumber’s Arms, 
the pub near her home in the exclusive area of Belgravia in central 
London.

With blood 
streaming from several wounds on her head, she cried: ‘Help me, help me,
help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’

Lady Lucan, who was estranged from her husband, said he had killed their nanny and tried to kill her.

Police found the couple’s three 
children asleep in their beds, unharmed, and when they went to the 
basement they were greeted by a macabre scene.

The
basement lightbulb had been removed, but in the semi-darkness, officers
made out a pool of blood with a man’s footprint in it (a bloodied towel
was in a bathroom), a blood-stained length of lead piping and a mailbag
containing a body.

The body was that of Sandra Rivett, the children’s live-in-nanny, who was the same height and build as Lady Lucan.

According
to Lady Lucan — living apart from her husband and in a bitter custody 
dispute over their children — she’d gone into the house to look for the 
nanny, but was attacked by her husband, whom she recognised by his 
voice, before managing to flee.

When
she returned with police, Lucan was gone. After the attack, he went to 
the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been 
murdered. He left his friends at 1.15am.

Three days later his car was found 
abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat 
and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia 
basement.

There was 
speculation that he had committed suicide, but no body was found. And 
there were rumours that his gambling friends John Aspinall and 
billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country

Two years later, Aspinall gave an 
interview in which he said that if Lucan had sought his help he would 
have given it unconditionally.

By then, the inquest into Sandra 
Rivett’s death had been held and Lucan was named as her murderer. The 
missing peer was declared legally dead in 1999.
