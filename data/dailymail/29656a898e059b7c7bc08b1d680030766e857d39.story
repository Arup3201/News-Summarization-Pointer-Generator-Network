A service being hailed as the first of its kind in the U.S. allows American Airlines passengers wiling to pony up a nominal fee to ship luggage from their arrival airport directly to their hotel, motel, home, office - or wherever they're going.

The amenity - available exclusively to AA fliers as of Aug. 7 - permits passengers to skip the dreaded baggage carousel and claim once their flight lands.

Misery: People wait at the dreaded airport luggage claim, although such images may become a thing-of-the-past with new amenities offered by airlines like A.A.

"This service will be especially valuable to families... with children as well as (sic) business travelers who need to go straight
to a meeting or the office," wrote American Airlines in a statement announcing the new door-to-door offer.

The service is available when you book your trip with the airline, or up to two hours before your 
flight takes off from the origin city, according to AA.

Fees begin at about $30, the company 
said in a statement, with the service already available at more than 200 
domestic airports, as well as select foreign cities.

AA's partner, BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery, boasted the airline is first in the US to offer such a convenience, although that monopoly could be short-lived.

American Airlines, beginning Monday, will now for as little as $30 ferry your luggage from the airport to your hotel or home in a promised 4-to-6 hrs., allowing you to skip baggage claim

'There's a lot of people who call themselves competitors, but they are actually shipping services,' Craig Mateer, founder and president of BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery, told MailOnline.

'With us, you don't have to pack and ship your luggage two days in advance of the trip and then hope that FedEx or UPS delivers it to your hotel or home or office. 

'When you use our service,' Mateer added, 'the luggage travels with you on the plane, and we deliver it once you land to your destination, wherever you might be going.'

 'When you use our service, the luggage travels with you on the plane and we deliver it once
you land at your destination to wherever you might be going.'

Mateer also exclusively told MailOnline that BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery is now in the 'testing phase' with other airlines in addition to A.A., although the executive wouldn't specify which other carriers might be the next to introduce the attractive amenity.

In hailing its new service, A.A. said your bags would typically be delivered from the airport to your ultimate destination within one-to-four hours after you land at your destination airport.

Monopoly short-lived: A.A. is the first to offer the new, so-called 'Baggage Delivery Service,' although its partner exclusively tells MailOnline its monopoly likely will not last

However, A.A. added that delivery times 
would exceed the promised one-to-four hour window if you're home, office or hotel
is more than 40 miles from the airport.

Also, luggage shipped more than 40 miles carries fees in addition to the nominal $29.95 cost of handling a single piece of luggage, the airline said.
