Donald Trump has compared the decision to build an offshore wind farm next to his £750million Scottish golf course issue 
to the release of the Lockerbie bomber, after ministers approved the controversial scheme.

Plans for the 11-turbine scheme in sight
of the tycoon’s multi-million pound Aberdeenshire golf resort attracted
his wrath, as he fears it will spoil the scenic coastal views.

But Energy Minister Fergus Ewing 
yesterday gave the go-ahead for the European Offshore Wind Deployment 
Centre (Eowdc), which could generate up to 100MW – enough to power 
almost half of Aberdeen’s homes.

Anger: U.S. property mogul Donald Trump has pledged to spend 'whatever is necessary' to stop the building of an offshore windfarm after Scottish ministers approved the scheme

Reacting to the news Mr Trump wrote: ‘The Scottish wind 
farm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al-Megrahi.’

Mr Trump – who has faced objections to his golf resort at Balmedie – vowed to spend ‘whatever is necessary’ to block the scheme.

He added: ‘This was a purely political 
decision, as dictated by Alex Salmond, a man whose obsession with 
obsolete wind technology will destroy the magnificence and beauty of 
Scotland.

‘Likewise, tourism, Scotland’s biggest industry, will be ruined.

‘We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed.

‘All over the world they are being abandoned, but in Scotland they are being built. We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated.

‘Likewise, we will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself.’

The Scottish Government has  claimed that the development, which will lie 1.25-2.8 miles off the coast, will be capable of generating enough energy to meet the needs of 49,000 homes, almost half the number in Aberdeen.

The scheme was put together by Vattenfall Wind Power and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg).  The application pitted Mr Trump against Mr Salmond.

Announcing the scheme, Mr Ewing said:
‘Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland, an 
opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious 
renewable energy and carbon reduction targets.’ 

Mr Ewing said the sector could 
generate more than £7billion for the economy in Scotland and support up 
to 28,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirectly by 2020.

The First Minister, who is the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: ‘The North-East of Scotland is a world energy capital and, in order to continue to prosper, we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research – marine renewables, as well as oil and gas.

‘A deployment centre will put Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire in pole position for the development of offshore wind technology. Our ambition must be to see Scotland as the home of research, development, fabrication and deployment of deep-water marine technology.’

The £230m proposed wind farm will be in sight of Mr Trump's golf development on the Aberdeenshire coast

Eowdc project spokesman  Iain Todd said: ‘The Scottish  Government’s most welcome approval for the Eowdc is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK’s offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector.’

The scheme’s go-ahead also relies on Aberdeenshire Council approving a cable and substation development to bring the power onshore.

A decision on that was deferred yesterday for a hearing as it emerged that several objections had been lodged.
