Authorities say a man found dead outside his dilapidated rural New York state home was a recluse who died leaving $3 million in the bank.

Ramapo police identified the 79-year-old on Tuesday as George Konnight. They say he lived alone since his sister's recent death.

Despite living ‘off the grid’ in the house in White Plains that appeared abandoned, Konnight had $3 million from the sale last fall of about 31 acres of his family's property in northern Ramapo.

His skeletal remains were found on Friday in the woods on his property, reports The Journal News. Konnigh would cut his own fire wood for heat.

Ramapo Detective Lt. Mark Emma said he lived a very simple ‘hermit-like’ life in a house without indoor plumbing or heat.

The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. Police believe he died of a medical condition.

A distant cousin said even as kids, they ‘didn't have many friends or even a telephone.’

A neighbor told the paper that the two lived like recluses and never had real jobs. They had no expenses other than taxes, and would sell land passed down in the family to pay them.

'Nobody knew them. They lived by themselves. I'd say hello to George and maybe got a wave. You never got much in return as far as answers from him,' said Eugene Erickson, a neighbor.

It may take months for the medical examiner to confirm that the remains are Konnight. He never visited a dentist, making it difficult for officials to identify the remains based on dental records.

Konnight's lawyer Thomas O'Connell had known his client for about 15 years ago and said he had been making strides in living a normal life after the death of his 'domineering' sister.

He had recently visited a doctor for the first time in decades and had talked about moving into a new home.

The money will now be donated to charity.
