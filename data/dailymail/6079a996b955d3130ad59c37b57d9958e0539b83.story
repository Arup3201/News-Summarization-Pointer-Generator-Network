Liverpool are ready to revive their interest in Ryan Bertrand as they continue their quest to find a new left-back.

Bertrand has been on Liverpool’s radar for more than 12 months and they came close to sign him in the January window but he ultimately ended up joining Aston Villa on loan.

Trying to conclude a deal, however, will be far from straightforward as Chelsea are reluctant to do business with a side they now regard as credible title rivals and they would be looking for a fee in excess of £8million.

On the move: Ben Davies has rejected Liverpool and joined Tottenham from Swansea

Liverpool have looked at a number of options to slot in to that position, most notably Sevilla's Alberto Moreno and Ben Davies, who has joined Tottenham from Swansea in the deal also involving Gylfi Sigurdsson and Michel Vorm.

Moreno had his heart set on a move to Anfield but Sevilla have been difficult to deal with and refused to budge from their valuation of £16m, forcing Liverpool – who are trying to close a loan deal for Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo – to look elsewhere. Manquillo will join a two-year loan with view to a £4.5m transfer.
