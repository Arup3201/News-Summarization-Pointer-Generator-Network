The parents of a Virginia teenager shot by a neighbor when he accidentally broke into his home while drunk, have questioned whether he was killed in self-defense.

Caleb Gordley, 16, was shot in the back by Donald West Wilder, who lives two doors away from the teenager's family in Sterling.

Caleb's parents, Jennea and Shawn initially said they forgave Mr Wilder, but the release of a police report months after their son was shot has forced them to change their minds.

Fatal error: Caleb was trying to sneak back into his home after drinking with friends when he entered the wrong property

'At no point, from the 
homeowner's ... testimony, the account of the events, did he ever describe
 Caleb in any way being aggressive,' Mr Gordley told ABC 20/20.

The autopsy report also showed that Caleb had been shot in the back, his parents said.

Star: Caleb Gordley was a popular student and excellent athlete

'If you're really in fear of danger of 
your life and your family's life, why would you allow a person ... that 
appeared to be dazed to you, walk right past you and then you shoot him 
in the back?' Mrs Gordley said.

The basketball star had crawled in a back window in the early hours.

He didn't realize the house he had entered 
was not his own, but one two doors away from where 
he lived.

After ending up in his neighbor's home, a drunk Caleb had tried to walk upstairs to where he thought his bedroom was.

When Mr Wilder heard his alarm go off,
 and saw a tall figure he didn't recognize, he grabbed his pistol and 
confronted what he thought was a burglar.

He
 yelled out at the teenager but Caleb continued to walk through the 
house and up the stairs, where Mr Wilder's girlfriend was sleeping.

'The homeowner said he made eye 
contact with Caleb, and there was a dazed look on his face, so he knew 
he was on drugs, alcohol, whatever the case may be,' Mr Gordley said.

'As he came up the steps, he said he saw no weapon, nothing like that.'

According
 to police reports seen by ABC, when Mr Wilder fired warning shots at 
Caleb, the teenager turned to him and said: 'You just shot me.'

Mr Wilder then fired up to three more shots, including one that hit Caleb in the back. 

Sheriff
 Michael Chapman said that the incident needed to be seen in the context
 of an unknown and dazed-looking intruder breaking into someone's home 
at 2.30am.

But the teenager's parents say their neighbor could have shot at his leg instead of aiming at his chest and head.

'He lined himself up at the perfect angle to 
shoot a hollow point bullet through my son's lung and explode his chest 
and then a fourth shot at his head for good measure,' Mr Gordley said.

Loss: Shawn and Jennea Gordley have questioned their neighbor's actions in shooting their 16-year-old son

Close: The teenager lived in a house that looked almost identical to his neighbor's

No charges have been filed against Mr Wilder, who declined to be interviewed on 20/20. Virginia law permits homeowners to use deadly force if they feel threatened inside their own homes.

'Do I hate him? No. Do I want him put away? No, I don't think that's going to solve anything,' Mrs  Gordley said.

The teenager's parents say they are still waiting for their neighbor to make an apology in person.
