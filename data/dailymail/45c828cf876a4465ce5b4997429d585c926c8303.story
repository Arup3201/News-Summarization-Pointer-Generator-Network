It has been called obscene, immoral and everything from a national scandal to a public disgrace.

This is not Labour party bigwigs being linked to paedophilia. Nor is it war dossiers being sexed up so young British men and women could be sent to needless death and maiming by posturing politicians.

And although it has to do with money, it is not related to greedy bankers stuffing their pockets while engineering a financial collapse which has left millions of impoverished, freezing pensioners with next to no interest on their hard-earned savings.

Jackpot: Wayne Rooney is set to sign a new deal with Manchester United worth £300,000-a-week

Why the glum face? Rooney looked a little gloomy on the way to training at Carrington on Wednesday

Oh no. The matter exercising angst across the land - or rather however much of it is still above water - is the prospect of Wayne Rooney earning £300,000 a week.

Now while this is an astonishing amount of money for anyone to be paid for kicking around a bladder full of wind, is it really such an outrage?

This wage is not being paid from our taxes. Rather, it will generate a healthy sum for the Inland Revenue. Nor will it come from investors misled into subscribing to dodgy schemes by City fat cats.

Rooney - assuming he signs his four-and-a-half-years (plus one) contract, and it is hard to think of a reason why he should not - is being offered roughly a fifty grand a week rise by his current employers.

Manchester United feel pressed to make this gesture because their team are struggling somewhat right now and they need to convince potential recruits that they are in the business of regaining their status in Europe, no matter the cost.

There will be fans of the club aghast at their generosity to a young man who has already held United to ransom twice by threatening to take his talent elsewhere, like Chelsea.

But the harsh reality is that if supporters don’t like it they can stop buying their tickets. No-one can force them to go to Old Trafford. Anyway, what most of them are hoping is that Rooney is so grateful that he will drag United back to the top of the Premier and Champions Leagues by his golden boot-laces.

Elsewhere in the football world many are goggling at so much dosh. Since this contract is being negotiated at the sensitive time when the English game has lost its finest ever player, the comparisons are acute.

Now there has been no greater admirer of Sir Tom Finney than myself. I grew up watching him play whenever I got the chance and then became privileged to know him and spend time in his modest, charming and courteous company.

And, yes, at £14 a week (£12 in a summer when there were no games so he could concentrate on being Preston’s most famous plumber) he like all his contemporaries was slavishly underpaid.

But that is not Rooney’s fault.

Not even when you looks at figures like these: that £14 in the mid-to-late 1950s, when Finney was at his peak with Preston and England, would be worth £267 today. So by that measure Rooney would expect £13,904 a year, not the £15.6million on the table.

True gentleman, great footballer: Sir Tom Finney, who died last Friday and is pictured here playing his last game for Preston in April 1960, never earned more than £14-a-week during his professional playing career

Never forgotten: Jeff Powell walks with Sir Tom on the pitch at Deepdale in 2009

Sir Tom’s career earnings with Preston 
North End totalled less than two-thirds what Rooney will take home in a 
week. And against the £194,656 (plus win bonuses) with which Finney’s 14
 years of uncomplaining one-club loyalty was rewarded, the 27-year-old 
Rooney stands to bank £85.8m if he lasts the next five-and-a-half years 
at United.

It needs to be remembered that Finney was a pioneering campaigner for the betterment of professional footballers and did not resent the phenomenal incomes of the modern player. And he among many would argue that high earnings are infinitely preferable to the old maximum wage.

Since football is very much part of the entertainment industry, there is no logical reason to differentiate between its own players and pop singers and film stars. And I for one believe Rooney brings more pleasure to the world than Justin Bieber.

If the market rate is three hundred grand, so be it.

However, big money brings with it heavy responsibility. Rooney should feel an obligation to move heaven and earth to revitalise United and bring the feelgood factor back to Old Trafford. His is an important club to both football and modern society and the fans who are frustrated at the moment are the very people who make this contract possible.

He is now in what should be the prime years of his career and needs to perform accordingly, consistently.

The supporters may very well be hoping that certain demands, as well as a hefty fortune, are in the small print. For example, as a young man who tends to put on weight, would it be too much to ask that he tips the scales at a match-ready poundage at least once a week. There might also be lifestyle conditions.

Like not zooming off to Las Vegas for mini-breaks, severely rationing trips to nightclubs and remembering that what he needs to be doing most for the next few, crucial years is training hard, eating sensibly and sleeping a lot.

If such restraints are being applied then perhaps Sir Alex Ferguson, as a United director now, has had something to do with it. Certainly, as manager, he had no fear of reading the riot act to his best player.

Hopefully now, as he matures, Rooney will realise that such discipline is as good for him as for his generous paymasters – and that it is time to deliver.

Pellegrini and Wenger must blame themselves for Euro humblings

Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger are football men to be respected but they did not distinguish themselves in Champions League defeat this week.

As first Manchester City and then Arsenal were beaten 2-0 at home by two of the mightiest clubs in Europe, they elected to blame the referees rather than search for reasons within themselves and their teams.

Pellegrini faces a touchline ban for accusing the Swedish official of bias in favour of Barcelona.

Pointing the finger: Manuel Pellegrini (second right) suggested that Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson was impartial during Manchester City's Champions League defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday night

Sorry, it was a sending off. And sorry again, when City captain Vincent Kompany admitted they gave their opponents too much respect he was right... and his manager was wrong to send them out in such a negative formation and mindset.

Wenger will escape sanction for calling Bayern Munich’s Arjen Robben a diver. But sorry, the Bayern Munich man was cut down by Arsenal’s goalkeeper so it was a penalty - and in my view a sending off as well.

Self destruction: Martin Demichelis's (bottom) clear foul on Lionel Messi deserved a red card

Rush of blood: Wojciech Szczesny's (left) foul on Robben was clear for all to see and also merited a sending-off

Now, playing against either Barca or Bayern with only 10 men is a monstrous task but it was not the fault of the men with the whistle that City and Arsenal had to do just that.

We know it hurts to be as good as out of the most important club football competition in the world in the round of the last 16.

But sometimes it behoves managers to put their hands up and admit they have been beaten by superior opponents, not wave their arms accusingly on the touchline in pathetic impersonations of Tom Daley as he takes off from the 10-metre board.
