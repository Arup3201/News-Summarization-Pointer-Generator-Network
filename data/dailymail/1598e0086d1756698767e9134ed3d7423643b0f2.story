A protester who burst into the middle of the Leveson inquiry as Tony Blair gave evidence revealed today how it was 'surprisingly easy' to get past security into the court.

David Lawley-Wakelin, 49, got into Court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice through a 'secure corridor' and accused the former Prime Minister of being a war criminal.

He shouted: ‘This man should be arrested for war crimes’, gesturing to  Mr Blair.

Embarrassing: David Lawley-Wakelin, dressed in a white shirt and chinos, then shouted to the stunned court, 'This man should be arrested for war crimes'

Bundled out: Tony Blair (far left) appeared unfazed by the disruption. Lord Justice Leveson (standing to the right of the commotion, did not. Robert Jay QC (standing below Leveson) held his head in his hands

'Completely untrue': After peace was restored to the courtroom, Mr Blair told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue'

Mr Lawley-Wakelin claimed that Mr 
Blair had been ‘bought’ by JP Morgan, and that the US investment bank 
had profited from the Iraq War.

He was then marched out of the court and into a van by police officers.

Speaking on LBC radio today he claimed
that it 'surprisingly easy' to get into the court and described how he 
managed to gain access to the inquiry.

He told James O'Brien on LBC 97.3: 
'You go through the metal detectors, any member of the public can 
actually go in, and I tried to get in through the front entrance of the 
Leveson inquiry but was evicted as I don't have any press accreditation.

Talk show: David Lawley-Wakelin told LBC presenter James O'Brien it was 'surprisingly easy' to break into the Leveson Inquiry

Protester: David Lawley-Wakelin was arrested but it wasn't his first Blair protest. He also interrupted a debate on the Iraq War on BBC's Question Time

'But I figured out there must be a back way in as Lord Leveson himself must have one.

'When I got there I was surprised to 
find out that there was no security at all and in fact the door to the 
court was wide open in the same way that Lord Leveson himself would have
got in there.'

Incredibly, Mr Lawley-Wakelin admitted he was more worried about upsetting his mother than getting arrested over his stunt.

Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry

Arrested: David Lawley-Wakelin said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry as he was escorted from the Royal Courts of Justice

Police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin

He said: 'I did lose my bottle at one point and telephoned my mother to ask if I should go in and she said 'go ahead'.

'I just checked she would back me up no matter what. So I decided to go up and give my evidence.'

He added it was 'a little unnerving' 
to find himself suddenly in the spotlight but that he decided his 'beef 
with Tony Blair is too great to miss this opportunity'.

Echoes: The interruption was an embarrassing echo of the 'custard pie' incident when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during a Commons Select Committee last year and his wife, Wendi Deng, leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker

During Tony Blair's evidence to the 
Leveson Inquiry, Mr Lawley-wakelin shouted to a stunned courtroom: 'JP 
Morgan paid him off for the Iraq war. Three months after he invaded Iraq
they held up the Iraq bank for 20 billion.

It was not the first televised anti-Blair protest by David Lawley-Wakelin.

The filmmaker
and veteran Iraq-War protester launched a similar attack during an 
episode of Question Time on the BBC (pictured above).

Posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone, he yelled: 'This country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil.' His outburst was met with rapturous applause.

He later travelled to Iraq to make a short film in which he claimed 'to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him'.

The Alternative Iraq Enquiry then asks: 'Should Tony Blair be taken to the Hague and tried for crimes against peace?'

Following a screening of the film at the Frontline Club in west London in 2010, he led a debate with former Labour MP Clare Short and Major General Tim Cross, who was commander of the British Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

According to the Internet Movie Database, the film and TV professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of Time Team - hosted by Tony Robinson - and a first assistant director on a 2010 Everest documentary entitled The Wildest Dream.

He is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called Saint Dracula 3D.

He once also appeared with anti-Iraq war MP George Galloway in a TalkSport radio show last year.

'He was then paid six million dollars 
every year and still is from JP Morgan six months after he left office. 
This man is a war criminal.'

As chief counsel Robert Jay QC, who 
had been leading Blair's grilling, held his head in his hands, security 
guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of 
the chamber.

Mr Blair, who is a senior adviser at 
JP Morgan on a reported salary of between £500,000 and £2.5million, 
immediately told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely 
and totally untrue'.

Mr Lawley-Wakelin was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours.

Police and prosecutors are now 
deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin after the 
Lord Justice Leveson ordered an investigation into how he breached 
security.

He said: 'A man by the name of David 
Lawley Wakelin interrupted and disrupted the proceedings of this Inquiry
for purposes of his own.

'I directed that an inquiry should 
take place and it has how been completed. Appropriate measures to 
prevent any risk of repetition have been taken.

'It is of critical importance that 
witnesses can give evidence without disruption of any sort and in those 
circumstances I am today referring this incident to the Director of 
Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecution Service who, in 
conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service, can decide the way in 
which the matter can be dealt with appropriately.'

The father of two, a fierce opponent 
of the war on Iraq, has publicly heckled Mr Blair before, during an 
episode of the BBC’s Question Time.

A freelance documentary filmmaker, he 
is separated from his wife Angela and lives alone in Notting Hill. He is
currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called Saint 
Dracula 3D.

On his Facebook page, under the 
section entitled 'political views', he writes: 'Blair and at least four 
of his cronies should be behind bars...'

He once also appeared with anti-Iraq war MP George Galloway in a TalkSport radio show last year.

The dramatic earlier disruption echoed
that of Jonnie Marbles who thrust a custard pie into Rupert Murdoch's 
face during his evidence to a Commons Select Committee last year, 
provoking wife Wendi Deng to athletically leap to the mogul's defence.
