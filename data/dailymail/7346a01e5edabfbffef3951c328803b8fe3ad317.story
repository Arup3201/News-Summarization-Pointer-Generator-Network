Confused: Damon Tobias Exum, 37, who is said to have crashed into a police patrol car - then handed its driver a beer after he was stopped

A drunk driver spent the weekend in jail after crashing into a police car then handing its driver a beer when he was pulled over, police said.

Confused Damon Tobias Exum is said to have crashed into the patrol car while he was driving in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.

He apparently didn't notice the mistake and continued along the highway, but the officer inside gave chase until Exum pulled over.

Officer Alvin Rodriguez reported that he asked Exum for his licence, but the 'heavily intoxicated' driver instead handed him a can of lager.

Exum was arrested on eight misdemeanour charges, including driving under the influence and reckless driving, WSB-TV Atlanta reported.

Sergeant Fidel Espinoza told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Exum had been driving westbound on I-285 near North Peachtree Road in Dunwoody when he collided with Officer Rodriguez's patrol car.

Officer Rodrguez was not hurt in the smash and his car was in good enough shape to pursue Exum until he eventually pulled over.

Thirty-seven-year-old Exum, of Dunwoody, was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'totally unaware that he had collided with the officer's patrol car', said Sergeant Espinoza.

Going through the motions then on what would appear to have been an already clear-cut case of drink driving, Officer Rodriguez asked for Exum's licence - and got something to drink instead.

Exum was thrown into DeKalb County Jail in lieu of $3,270 bail.

Police said it was his third DUI arrest.
