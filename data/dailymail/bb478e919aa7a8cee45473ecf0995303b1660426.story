A controversial app inspired by the hit Disney animation Frozen enables users to perform a Caesarean on Princess Anna, one of the movie's title characters. 

Anna Giving Birth, which is the work of software designer Oleg Vinogorodov, is an unlicensed - and unofficial - Frozen app which claims to pick up where the popular animated movie left off, nine moths after Anna is thought to have married her love interest Kristoff.  

'Anna got married and she was pregnant in the spring,' the app's description explains. 'Now nine months had elapsed, and it's time to give birth to a baby.

Mother-to-be: Anna Giving Birth claims to pick up where Disney's hit animated movie Frozen left off

Operation: Users are asked to perform a C-section on Princess Anna

Newborn baby: When the baby has been delivered, users must then cut its umbilical cord

'Anna needs a very experienced doctor to help her deliver her baby. Let's come to help her!'

Players of the game are asked to take on the role of the doctor, and begin by monitoring the baby's heartbeat using the app's 'fetus egg monitor'. 

Then, after Anna's stomach has been treated with a bizarre freezing spray, users are instructed to pick up a scalpel and perform her C-section.

A baby then appears on Anna's stomach, before the app prompts you to cut its umbilical cord with the same scalpel that was used to perform the original procedure.

You then weigh and wrap the genderless child, whose genitals are covered with what appears to be three small starfish, and then hand it back to its delighted parents, Anna and Kristoff.

The app has, unsurprisingly, sparked outrage on social media, with many parents taking to Twitter to voice their concerns about such a graphic game being connected to one of the world's most popular children's movies.

'PEOPLE OF THE TWITTER: please do not download or play [Anna Giving Birth] it will ruin Frozen and scar you for life,' tweeted @kerstin_landry, while @teaganjaee added: 'Anna Giving Birth is so disturbing.'

It seems that some people have found humor in the controversial app however, with many opting to post what appear to be parody reviews on the game's iTunes page, no doubt in the hopes of eliciting further frustration from any concerned parents. 

'This app has changed the way I look at the world,' one review reads. 'I remember it vividly; I smuggled my phone into jail after being arrested...

'I needed a way to pass time faster so I downloaded this app. My inmates made fun of me and I almost thought about deleting the app but thank God I didn't... This app gave me faith not only in humanity, but in myself. My inmates say that after this app, I became a fatter, man version of Mother Teresa.

'The real training this application gave me was used one ordinary day in jail. A fellow female inmate was 9 months pregnant and we couldn't get a doctor fast enough, so I volunteered to perform the child birth.'
