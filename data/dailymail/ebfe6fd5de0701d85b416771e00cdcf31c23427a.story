2014 has seen another 12 months of tantalising sporting action. From events such as the World Cup to the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup - there has been a plethora of moments that have captivated us all.

Sportsmail have captured these historic moments step-by-step through our own brilliant photography team.

Below, Sportsmail's Kevin Quigley picks out his favourite taken images from 2014.

Sportsmail's Kevin Quigley photographed Steven Gerrard jumping in the air after scoring his side's winning goal against Fulham 

This Steven Gerrard is certainly my favourite picture I have taken this year. Not only because of how it looks but due to the fact I wouldn't have been able to get the image if Liverpool were not awarded a penalty in the final minute of added time. With the score at 2-2, Gerrard stepped up to slam the penalty home before going wild to give me this stunning picture

My image was shot on a Nikon D3s, Lens 70-200mm, 1/800th second, ISO 2500, F2.8
