A Danish woman has become the latest Westerner to travel to the besieged Syrian city of Kobane and join Kurdish forces bravely battling Islamic State militants. 

Joanna Palani, a 20-year-old of Kurdish descent, is understood to have written a message on her Facebook page describing a minor foot injury she picked up during a 'hard' attack on the jihadis.

Minutes earlier she had updated the page with a photograph of herself calmly smiling while wearing military fatigues, a bullet proof vest and carrying a large assault rifle - threatening ISIS militants with the words: 'See you on the front line tomorrow'.

Ms Palani has become the latest Westerner to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane, where Syrian Kurds assisted by Iraqi Peshmerga troops and US and Arab coalition warplanes have managed to force hundreds of militants out of the centre of the city.

Ms Palani is the latest Westerner to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane (pictured), where Syrian Kurds assisted by Iraqi Peshmerga troops and US warplanes have forced hundreds of militants out the city centre

Details of Ms Palani's journey to fight ISIS in Syria were reported by the Danish newspaper BT.

Less than a month ago she had made a gave an interview to Politiken saying that she was dropping out mid-way through her college course and intended to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane.

It is likely Ms Palani, who has lived in Denmark since she was three-years-old, has joined the Kurdish YPJ regiment - the all-female force of the better known YPG (People's Protection Unit).

Both groups are affiliated with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), which has been designated a terror group by NATO, but Ms Palani makes it clear that she does not agree with this assessment. 

'The Kurds are fighting for democracy and Western values,' she was quoted as saying. 

'If I get captured or killed, I will be proud of why I was killed. If I was afraid of the consequences of going down there, I would not consider it,' she reportedly added.

In her earlier interview with Politiken before she left for Syria, Ms Palani said she would do exactly the same thing had Denmark come under attack by Islamic extremists.

'I love Denmark. I grew up here and I love the freedom of our society. If Denmark should ever be attacked, I'm going to go in the front row with a Danish flag around my shoulders,' she was quoted as saying.

'But I've Kurdish family, and right now it is the Kurds who are attacked by brainwashed Islamists,' she added. 'she told  in October. 

She is far from the first Westerner to join the Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in Kobane.

There have been numerous other reports from Kobane of Westerners travelling taking up arms against the militants - including claims that a number of European biker gangs had ridden to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. 

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobane to join the fight against ISIS.

This morning Kurdish fighters captured six buildings from ISIS near Kobane and seized a large haul of their weapons and ammunition, a group monitoring the war said.

The terror group has been desperately trying to capture the town for more than two months in an assault that has driven tens of thousands of Kurdish civilians over the border into Turkey.

The six buildings seized by Kurdish fighters this morning were in a strategic location in the town's north, close to Security Square where the main municipal offices are based, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The Kurds also took a large quantity of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, guns and machine gun ammunition.

The clashes killed around 13 Islamic State militants, including two senior fighters who had been helping to lead the militant group's assault on the town, he said.

Kurdish forces appear to have made other gains in recent days of fighting. 

Last week they blocked a road Islamic State was using to resupply its forces, the first major gain against the jihadists after weeks of violence.

'During the last few days we have made big progress in the east and southeast,' said Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane.

But Islamic State still appeared to be holding a significant grip on the town. Abdulrahman estimated it controlled more than 50 percent of the city.
