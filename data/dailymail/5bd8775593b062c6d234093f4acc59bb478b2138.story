Tributes: Hani Haji Hassan, who was killed after she was involved in a collision with a lorry, was a 'lovely girl' who wanted to be a doctor, her family have said

This is the first picture of an 11-year-old girl who was killed by a lorry on her way home from school.

The devastated relatives of Hani Haji Hassan today said she was a 'lovely girl' who wanted to be a doctor.

Her family have described how they had to take the agonising decision to turn off her life support machine after she was taken to hospital following the incident.

Hani, the eldest of six girls, was struck by the lorry a stone's throw from her home in Streatham, south London yesterday afternoon. Police have said the driver stopped at the scene and was not arrested.

She was rushed to hospital suffering from severe head injuries but died soon after.

Her father Aweis Haji, 43, said: 'No parents should have to take the decision we had to and turn off the life support - it is the worst experience to see your daughter like that.'

Paying tribute to his 'caring' niece today, Hani's uncle Yusuf Sheikh said: 'Hani was a very lovely person.

'She was very quiet, charming and modest. She was the eldest of six girls and she was very caring towards all her sisters.

'She loved reading - she used to read all the time. She was a very sensible person and used to do all her homework - she wanted to be a doctor.

'She knew how to look after herself, although the accident was just one of those things.'

He said: 'This is very, very difficult for the whole family. We are just trying to stay together and show each other as much support as possible.'

Another of Hani's relatives wept as she paid tribute to the schoolgirl, who was a pupil at the Harris Academy in Merton.

She
said: 'Hani was a lovely, active girl. We are so shocked by what has 
happened - it's such a big shock. It's a very difficult time for us.'

The
woman, who was standing close to Hani's stricken mother as she spoke, 
said: 'Hani's mum cannot speak. She is hurting too much.'

Scene: Officers were called to Streatham Place after the girl was in collision with the lorry at 3.20pm yesterday

Tragedy: Streatham Place, Streatham, where a girl was knocked down and killed

Everald McLeggon, 62, said the girl's 
mother was screaming and crying at the scene at the time of the incident and required treatment for 
shock, according to the London Evening Standard.

He said: 'Then her father came running out. He was holding his head in his hands.

'I’m a big man but I’ve got kids and even I had to cry a bit when I saw what had happened.'

Location: It is believed the girl was making her way home from a local secondary school and had just got off a bus when the incident happened in Streatham Place

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'The driver stopped at the scene and was not arrested.

'Officers from Hampton traffic garage are investigating the incident and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.
