An elderly baroness whose former gardener claimed he was left deaf by years spent mowing grass on her country estate has successfully fought off his legal battle for £25,000 compensation.

Clifford Sayers, 66, claimed he was deafened by the din of his power tools while tending to the East Sussex estate, home to Pia, Lady Chelwood, widow of Military Cross holder and former Tory MP Tufton Beamish.

Mr Sayers, who looked after the grounds of the £700,000 home for almost 20 years after being hired by Lord Chelwood, had launched legal action seeking damages for ‘noise induced deafness’.

He claimed his intrusive tinnitus resulted from years of using lawn mowers, chainsaws, strimmers and other power tools in his job and that the noise prevented him from watching TV and made normal conversation with his wife impossible.

However, his case, finally hit the buffers yesterday as three top judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that he had left it too late to sue and that Lady Chelwood would not have a fair chance of defending herself due to the delay.

The case had initially been thrown out by a county court judge last year on the same grounds.

Last night the 90-year-old widow, who said she had felt betrayed by the noise claim, welcomed the ruling saying that 'justice has been done'.

She said: ‘The court has, for the second time, thrown out this frivolous case. Justice has been done.’

‘I’m very pleased but I always knew what the outcome would be - I knew he would never win. The whole thing was farcical.

‘I feel nothing for that man, and now I never have to think about him again.’

Lord Justice Jackson, sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Kitchin, said the legal deadline for launching personal injury compensation cases had expired four years before Mr Sayers lodged his claim in July 2008 and it would not be fair on Lady Chelwood to extend that time limit.

Lord Chelwood, formerly Colonel Sir Tufton Victor Hamilton Beamish, took on Mr Sayers as a gardener and forester in 1981 to look after the grounds of his country home, set in the East Sussex countryside above the South Downs.

Lord Chelwood - long satirised by Private Eye as Sir Bufton-Tufton - was a staunch champion of the countryside and a keen ornithologist.

The court heard Mr Sayers worked for him until his death in 1989 aged 72, and then for Austrian born Pia. He lived in a lodge on the estate until he left her employment in 2000.

His duties also included tending pheasants and feeding the ponies. But it was using the mechanical tools, Mr Sayers alleges, that caused the ‘intrusive’ ringing in his ears.

He claims he had a 45 per cent reduction in his overall hearing and suffered from what was described as ‘an irreparable industrial disease’.

However, he was told in 2005 that his hearing loss could be age-related.

Arguing that a county court judge had been wrong to strike out Mr Sayers’ claim, his barrister, Simon Mallett, insisted that too much account had been taken for Lady Chelwood’s advanced age and the problems she might face in giving evidence.

However, dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Jackson said that, apart from memory having failed with time, crucial insurance documents had been mislaid and Lady Chelwood’s defence to her former gardener’s claim would be unfairly prejudiced by the delay.

Last night Mr Sayers who lives in Crowborough, East Sussex, said that he was 'disappointed' with the ruling.
