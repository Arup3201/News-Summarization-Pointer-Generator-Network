A guest at a christening needed 50 stitches after he was glassed in the face following a quip about his orange tie representing the 'tangerine' colours of Blackpool Football Club, a court heard.

Victor Lisowski, 25, was asked if he was a Blackpool supporter by Benjamin Owen, but Mr Lisowski misunderstood the comment and pushed Owen away who retaliated by smashing a glass in his face.

Mr Lisowski was left with a permanent scar running from his left eye to the bottom of his chin, while Owen, 27, was jailed for five years after he was convicted at Bolton Crown Court of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Owen was enjoying the christening celebration at Heaton Cricket Club, in Bolton, Greater Manchester, when he fell out with Mr Lisowski, over a misunderstanding about his joke about his attire.

Owen asked Mr Lisowski if he was a fan of Blackpool FC as his tie was the same colour.

Mr Lisowski, who is not interested in football, did not understand and pushed him away and the court heard Owen then smashed the pint glass in his face.

The injury, described as 'horrific' by the judge, needed 50 stitches and left Mr Lisowski with a permanent scar running from his left eye to the bottom of his chin.

Judge Charles Bloom said: 'This case is about as tragic as any case could be. Two decent people came together at a family christening - it's an occasion of joy and celebration.

'It started with a misunderstanding and a miscommunication. You were intending to be jocular, but he didn't get the joke.'

He added that Owen, of Little Lever, Bolton, was a good family man who worked hard and was well liked.

Judge Bloom said: 'But your life now lies in ruin. It's an absolute tragedy for everybody.'

Owen was supported in court by about 15 friends and family, several of whom were in tears as the judge read out his sentence.

He was told that he would serve two-and-a-half years in prison and the remainder on licence.

Owen had denied wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but was found guilty after a trial.

Speaking outside court, Mr Lisowski, of Heaton, Bolton, said: 'I've never had an apology, and that's something I'd like.'

He added: 'I don't follow football at all. It doesn't interest me. Imagine if someone was calling you a tangerine (a nickname for Blackpool supporters) and you didn't know why.

'I'm just getting on with my life now, but I've got a permanent visible reminder of what happened every time I look in the mirror.'
