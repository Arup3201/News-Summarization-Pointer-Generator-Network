Pep Guardiola has been praised by Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and the 59-year-old claims that the Spaniard is 'more German than the Germans.'

The 44-year-old is renowned for his hard-work and dedication to the cause and Rummenigge has acknowledged this during his time at the Bayern helm.

The Bundesliga leaders are 11 points clear and still unbeaten in the league, while also being involved in all the major competitions, and the Bayern chief puts this down to his coach's work ethic.

'Guardiola works incredibly hard. He is more German than the Germans when it comes to his work ethic,' Rummenigge told Kicker.

'When the players have all long returned home and are relaxing on the sofa, Guardiola is still around and working on a masterplan for the next game.'

Rummenigge is convinced that his coach will still be in charge next season, despite reports claiming the Spaniard could be set for a sensational return to former club Barcelona.

'Guardiola will still be our coach next season,' he added. 'We believe in each other. I hope that Pep will remain at Bayern for a long time.

'He does not want to commit his future to Bayern at this stage, but he will stay here so long as he and his family feel well here.

'The coach is not a source of unrest at Bayern, but he is not the calmest person around either. He is determined to help the team to the next level on a permanent basis.'
