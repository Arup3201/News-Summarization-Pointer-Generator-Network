A grandmother held her daughter and two-year-old grandson hostage after abducting them with a Taser stun gun.

An Amber Alert was issued after toddler Ronnie Tran and his mother were kidnapped by two women from their home in Des Moines, Washington, on Tuesday.

Police say the 40-year-old mother was stunned with a Taser and bound with plastic ties before being driven with her son to a house in Fife.

The mother was then tied to a cupboard in the garage while the boy was taken inside the home.

She managed to untie herself, but had to flee without her son, police said.

The mother did not ring police but instead called a family member to collect her, only dialling 911 later that evening, it was reported by KIRO7.

A neighbor, Tony Marta, told how he saw a woman run screaming from the garage next door.

He said: 'She like stuttered, saying "they attacked me" in broken English.' 

Reunited: Ronnie with his parents after being located by police in Renton on Wednesday

Police said Ronnie was found safe and well in Renton at 9am yesterday and has been reunited with his parents.

It is not clear exactly how or where he was located.

Police have arrested one woman, named as Alyssa M Chang, but say the boy's paternal grandmother, 65-year-old Vien Nguyen, is still at large.

Detectives have not revealed a motive.
