Jailed: Travis Scott, 36, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after faking his own death

A convicted fraudster who faked his own suicide by leaving a shotgun and suicide note in a canoe splattered with his blood has been sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison.

Travis Scott, from Eden Prairie, Minnesota, hatched the elaborate plan to fake his own death and then escape to Canada in 2011 to avoid a prison sentence for a $11.5 million insurance scam.

He ground up some of his wisdom teeth, pulled strands of hair from his head and drew several pints of blood before leaving it in a stocking cap that he placed in the canoe on Lake Mille Lacs.

Three days later, authorities came across the cap alongside a shotgun and a suicide note, which explained Scott had also weighed down his body so it would sink.

In fact, he had escaped on an airplane he had bought under an assumed name, flying out from a nearby airport in the middle of the night, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

He
flew into an unsupervised airport near 
Winnipeg and rented a hangar under a fake name He
then hiked into Winnipeg, rented an apartment, got a cat and bought a computer and a Jeep.

Then using Canadian death notices, he was able to obtain the birth certificate of a baby who had died aged two.

He used the name to create a fake ID 
badge based on one worn by a cable TV installer who came to his 
apartment. With the ID, he was able to get a driver's license.

He was waiting for a passport to travel to Australia or Belize when he was
caught using faked prescriptions for anxiety pills at a pharmacy.

Scene: He had left blood, hair, a gun and a suicide note behind in a canoe on Lake Mille Lacs in 2011 - before fleeing to Canada where he assumed the identity of a dead child

Eighty-two days after he faked his suicide, he was arrested and his real identity was discovered.

On Monday, Scott was sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison by U.S.
District Judge Donovan Frank in St. Paul, the Star Tribune reported.

In a statement before the sentencing, the 36-year-old fraudster said that if he were released he 
could use his technological skills to reimburse the money he stole.

But Tim Rank, the federal prosecutor, said that Scott was 'a manipulative person'.

'There is very little question that the defendant will engage in fraud once again whenever he is released from prison,' prosecutors said in court filings.

Authorities explained that they quickly learned that the suicide was a ruse.

Scott had left a bullet in the chamber of the shotgun, which would only have been there if the gun had been pumped - ejecting the casing - after firing. Police deduced this would have been impossible if he had shot himself in the upper body.

They also noted that no vehicle had been left nearby that Scott would have used to get there.

Then finally, they learned he was facing prison for fraud.

'It became very evident very soon this is likely an individual who wants everyone to believe he died, and had gone through an extravagant effort to make us believe it,' Mille Lacs County Sheriff Bruce Lindgren said. 'The likelihood that he had committed suicide was remote.'

The faked suicide came after Scott pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering for filing a false claim with insurance company, Zurich North America. He faced five to 10 years in prison.

He had claimed that his supercomputers were damaged by a lightning strike and was awarded $9.5 million in losses and $1.9 million for business interruption.

He allegedly bought three airplanes, cars, a $700,000 house and a $300,000 yacht.

The court will now oversee forfeiture of Scott's property. He is responsible for restitution of $11,517,772.20.
