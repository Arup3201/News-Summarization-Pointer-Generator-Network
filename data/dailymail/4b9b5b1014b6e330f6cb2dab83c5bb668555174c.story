A
 couple who allegedly left their nine-month-old baby to drown in the bath wept in court yesterday as they were accused of failing in the 'most basic of 
parental responsibilities'.

Emma Oliver, 22, was washing her daughter Daisy Anderson in a small tub placed in the bath at home in New Moston, Manchester, when she decided to go round to a neighbour's for a chat.

She reportedly left Daisy's father Dale Anderson, 25, to take care of the baby as she walked round to the terraced house next door to theirs.

Tragic: Daisy Anderson drowned after being left alone in the bath at her home in Manchester, a court heard

Standing trial: Emma Oliver (left), 22, was washing her daughter in the bath on September 24, 2012. She then reportedly decided to round to a neighbour's house for a chat, leaving Dale Anderson (right), 25, in charge

But minutes after he began bathing his daughter, Anderson allegedly realised there were no clean nappies or towels in the bathroom, so he left the room and started searching downstairs.

However, when he returned, he discovered the baby was lying face-down in the water and not breathing, the court heard.

In desperation, Anderson is believed to have placed Daisy on a bed of teddy bears, before performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on her.

Meanwhile, Oliver, who had returned to the house, reportedly ran back to her neighbour's to call an ambulance.

But despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Daisy was pronounced dead in hospital later that day.

Now, Anderson and Oliver have appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with child neglect.

Yesterday,
 the court heard that Anderson had been left alone with Daisy while 
Oliver chatted to their neighbour about schools on the morning of 
September 24, 2012. 

The couple are alleged to have crossed each other
 on the stairs as Oliver left the bathroom to walk next door, leaving their daughter unattended for the first time that day.

Paramedics
 were alerted to Daisy's fate at around 10.40am and arrived at the house
 within two minutes of the call, where they reported that the baby was 
not breathing.

They took the baby to North Manchester Children’s Hospital, where doctors tried desperately to revive her.

However, she had already gone into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead two hours later.

David Temkin, prosecuting, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court: 'There is no doubt that this case is extremely sad.

'Nobody
 in this room could fail to be moved by hearing about the death of a 
baby. You must try your very best to deal with this case as coolly and 
calmly as you can.

'The prosecution’s case is that each of these defendants failed in their duties as parents towards this young girl.

'The
 first and most devastating way was that they each left the child 
unattended in the bath. Not for long, but long enough for tragedy to 
strike.

'The second way is that these defendants failed in their parental duties because of the state of their home.

'The prosecution’s case is that they failed to ensure that the home was safe enough, clean enough and hygienic enough to be suitable for bringing up a child.'

The court 
heard that police had started investigating Oliver and Anderson for 
child neglect after officers noticed the 'dirty and unhygenic' state of their house while Daisy and her parents were in hospital.

Neighbours
 had been so worried about the state of the couple’s home that they had 
started hoovering and tidying up the mess before the police arrived, the jury heard.

Tributes: David Temkin, prosecuting, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court: 'There is no doubt that this case is extremely sad'. Above, teddies and floral tributes are left outside Oliver and Anderson's home in Manchester

But police officers quickly halted the clean-up operation and 
noted the house had dirty nappies lying around, food on a high chair, 
dirty dishes covered in congealed food, damp clothing on the floor and 
dirty bed clothes on the cot.

In an interview with officers, Oliver and Anderson were asked whether an 'accident' had occurred, to which they reportedly replied that Daisy had just ‘stopped breathing’ moments earlier - 
making no reference to the bath.

Mr Temkin said it was ‘perfectly clear’ each of the defendants had ‘loved and cherished’ Daisy, and felt ‘deep sadness at their loss’.

But he added: 'It’s not a case about intentional cruelty - it’s a case about serious failings in the most basic of parental responsibility.'

Mr Temkin told the court that Anderson had known that his partner had left the house to chat with a neighbour that morning.

'Mr Anderson went into the bathroom and carried on bathing her but after a time realised there was no towels or nappies in the room,' he said. 'He went out of the bathroom and left the child unattended.

'He went downstairs to get what was needed. It is not precisely clear how long he was out for but when he got back he saw Daisy was lying down facing the water. He took her out and tried to revive her with mouth to mouth. As he was doing that Miss Oliver returned.

'She knocked on the front door to be let in. Mr Anderson left the child again to let her in. He told her what had happened.'

'[Oliver] was at the house for about 20 minutes because I was just doing general cleaning. It was general chitchat - we were all going to put the kids names down at school local to us,' she said.

'She didn’t mention where Daisy was and I didn’t have any concerns.

'She had one back to get her coat to go the school and I was washing the pots when I saw her run passed the kitchen window. She came into my house and said Daisy’s not breathing. She said "phone an ambulance". She was panicking and my first instinct was to follow her out.'

She added: 'I saw Dale trying to resuscitate the baby and I rang for an ambulance. Emma moved Daisy into the kitchen and I told her to put her down flat. She put her down in the living room. Dale punched the wall and another neighbour tried to help.'

Miss Sutton said a 999 operator had given her CPR instructions as both parents tried to revive her and neighbours gathered.

'Everybody was just in panic mode - we all had the same interest at heart, to help Daisy,' she said.

'The paramedic arrived and said I had done amazing and that’s when I filled up and got as lump in my throat because it all hit home and the reality sunk in.

She added: 'Emma was a good mum - she looked after her daughter. Daisy was always dressed nicely and Emma put her first. She would go without for Daisy.'

Paramedic Philip Ogden told the jury: 'When I arrived at the house, I noticed the hallway was very messy, clothes and toys were scatted and I had to step over things.

'I walked into the living room and there was quite a few people there. I saw the baby girl was undressed and appeared to be dry.

'Her father appeared to be doing CPR. I asked what had happened and was told she had just stopped breathing a few minutes before the call was made. I asked if there had been any untoward incident at all. They said there hadn’t.

‘I asked a couple of times if there had been any illnesses or accidents that would explain the situation. But I was told she had just stopped breathing moments earlier.'

Oliver eventually told nursing staff at the hospital what had happened, the court heard.

Oliver and Anderson deny two counts of child neglect.

The trial continues.
