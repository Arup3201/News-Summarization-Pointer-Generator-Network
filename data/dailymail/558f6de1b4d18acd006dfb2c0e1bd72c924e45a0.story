Police believe Alan Edwards, 46, deliberately drove his car into a parked big-rig off the 5 Freeway near Castaic, California, in the early hours of Monday

Police believe a 46-year-old father deliberately killed himself and his two young children by driving his car into a parked big-rig off the 5 Freeway near Castaic, California.

Alan Edwards of Lancaster was killed, along with Erick Edwards, 9, and Alona  Edwards, 5, where their 1997 Honda Accord slammed head-on into the parked tractor trailer in the early hours of Monday morning.

The incident happened just before 1 a.m. and investigators were immediately suspicious because the driver had had to intentionally maneuver in order to hit the back of the rig.

‘Because of this we don’t believe he fell asleep,’ Eddie Hernandez, a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department homicide detective, told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal.

There was no evidence Edwards had braked, the lieutenant said, adding that he and his wife Sherri were going through a divorce and custody battle over the children after eight years of marriage.

On Friday, Sherri had sold the family’s home in Lancaster but neglected to tell her estranged husband about the sale, she said.

When Edwards arrived to collect the kids for the weekend, he found the home virtually empty and sold.

Over the weekend he refused to return his wife’s calls and when he didn’t return the kids as scheduled on Sunday, she reported them missing.

'This was a murder-suicide,' she told SCVS. 'He left his driver’s licence, his keys and my son’s asthma medication. All the doors were unlocked.'

On Tuesday, detectives released a statement confirming that they believe the driver’s actions were deliberate.

‘Preliminary information indicates that the adult male suspect deliberately collided with a parked tractor trailer at a high rate of speed without making any attempts to stop, killing himself and two victims in the car,’ read the statement.
