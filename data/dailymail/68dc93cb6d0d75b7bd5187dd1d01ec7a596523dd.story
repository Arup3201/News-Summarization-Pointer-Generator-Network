The Forestry Commission has declared a national emergency after it found a disease which has devastated ash trees in Europe has spread to the British countryside.

Ash dieback has been found in the wider environment at sites in East Anglia, and there are fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as Dutch elm disease in the Seventies.

Responding to the outbreak, the government today said it will bring in a ban on ash imports and tight restrictions on ash movements within Britain on Monday.

Under threat: An ash tree in Gwent. The Forestry Commission today warned that a virulent disease affecting the trees has spread to the UK - and there are fears it could cause as much damage as Dutch elm disease

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson 
told MPs of the plan after Simon Hart, Tory MP for Carmarthen West and 
South Pembrokeshire, asked in Commons Defra questions what steps the 
department was taking to deal with the disease.

The Chalara fraxinea fungus, which 
causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death, wiped out
90 per cent of ash trees in Denmark in seven years.

It had previously been identified in 
nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park, a college 
campus and a new woodland.

The Forestry Commission today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases.

Ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea (C. fraxinea). The disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees, as pictured right, and it can lead to tree death.

European trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in Poland in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other European countries.

However, it was 2006 before the fungus’s asexual stage, C. fraxinea, was first described by scientists, and 2010 before its sexual stage, Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus, was described.

In February 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the Netherlands to a nursery in Buckinghamshire.

Since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in England and Scotland, including a car park in Leicester; a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland at Knockmountain, near Kilmacolm, west of Glasgow; a college campus in South Yorkshire; and a property in County Durham.

All these sites had received stocks of young ash plants from nurseries within the past five ears.

However, now that infected older trees have been found in East Anglia with no apparent connection with nursery stock, the Forestry Commission are also investigating the possibility that it might have entered Britain by natural means. 

Mr Paterson told the Commons: 'I’ve 
very grateful to [Mr Hart] for raising this because there have been 
reports today on the radio of the horrific danger to our 80 million ash 
trees.

'We have already launched a 
consultation on the ground looking in real detail to see whether this 
disease has taken root in this country.

'That consultation will report to me 
tomorrow and I will discuss it over the weekend with the head of the 
Forestry Commission GB and I think on the evidence we are seeing, I 
intend to bring in a ban on imports and tight restrictions of ash 
movements within GB on Monday.'

Labour’s MP Dame Joan Ruddock 
criticised the timing of the coalition’s response to the issue, arguing 
Mr Paterson would 'not be forgiven for any delay'.

She said: 'May I tell the Secretary of
State that he should have banned the import of ash seedlings the minute
the disease was actually found in nurseries in this country. He will 
not be forgiven for any delay by the people of this country who so value
the ash trees.

'Will he ensure that the Forestry Commission has all the resources it needs to be able to confront this terrible threat?'

Mr Paterson replied: 'I think she is 
being pretty unfair. The minute we heard about this we launched a 
consultation, that will report tomorrow, so on the basis of evidence, 
and all her colleagues are shouting at me about evidence and science 
based, I will look at the evidence from tomorrow evening and if it’s a 
sensible decision I will ban the import and I will make restrictions on 
Monday.'

The Woodland Trust today confirmed the
fungus had been found in both mature ancient woodland and woodland 
creation areas on its estate at Pound Farm in Suffolk.

The Trust is supporting a ban on 
importing and moving ash trees in a bid to stop the disease becoming 
established in the UK, which the Government is poised to bring in as 
early as next week.

The Horticultural Trades Association 
has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing 
ash trees for planting in this country.

But there are concerns that if it has been found in the wider countryside, a ban on imports could be of limited value.

Infected: A tree in Franfurt, Germany, suffering from ash dieback. The disease, caused by the Chalara fraxinea fungus, causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death

In the UK, ash trees make up around 30
per cent of the wooded landscape, across woodlands, hedgerows and park.
Losing the trees would have serious implications for Britain's ecology,
warned Andrew Sharkey, head of woodland management for the Woodland 
Trust.

Dutch elm disease caused the deaths of more than 25million elms in the UK alone, almost completely eradicating one of the English countryside's most distinctive trees.

Although Dutch elm disease first reached these shores in 1927, a new, more virulent strain appeared in 1967 to which the English elm was particularly susceptible.

Caused by a fungus spread by the elm bark beetle, the Dutch elm disease is believed to actually be native to Asia, from where it was accidentally spread by man.

Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic nearly all of Britain's English elm trees, which often grew 150ft high, are gone.

The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ('suckers'); but these suckers rarely reach more than 5m before the fungus attacks.

The largest remaining concentration of mature elm trees in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where 15,000 elms still stood in 2005, several of which were estimated at over 400 years old.

Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area and efforts of local authorities remove infected sections of trees as soon as they show symptoms.

'This is yet another example of why 
the protection of our native trees, natural resources and eco-systems 
needs to be at the top of the agenda and we need a step change in the 
level of importance placed on bio-security to tackle the bigger issue,' 
he said.

'The occurrence of tree diseases in 
the UK is becoming far too frequent and once they are established we are
often powerless to act.

'We are potentially facing the ash 
equivalent of Dutch elm disease, and unless we take serious measures as a
country we will continue to see problems arising from imported 
diseases.'

The Trust called for an emergency 
summit or taskforce to be set up by the Government to tackle tree 
diseases, before another species was lost for good.

Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry 
Commission’s plant health service, said: 'We and our colleagues in the 
Food and Environment Research Agency, the Scottish Government and the 
Northern Ireland Forest Service have stepped up our efforts to tackle 
this disease as a priority.

'This includes redeploying Forestry 
Commission staff from their usual duties to survey woods and forests in 
East Anglia and throughout Great Britain.'

He added:'It is still early days and 
investigations are continuing, but there is a possibility that the East 
Anglia outbreak is an isolated one which has been present for some time.

'This emphasises the importance of preventing spread further afield.'

He urged forest managers and tree 
professionals to use the information on the Forestry Commission’s 
website about the disease, inspect trees again and report any suspected 
to be infected.

As a precaution, the Forestry Commission is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages.

Infected ash trees have also be identified at Norfolk Wildlife Trust’s Lower Wood reserve, Ashwellthorpe.

The trust’s head of nature reserves, 
John Milton, said: 'This is possibly the first case of ash dieback 
disease in established woodland in Norfolk, although it is likely we 
will now see further cases.

'We are working closely with the plant health team from Forestry Commission and monitoring our woodlands closely.'

But he warned: 'Tracking the disease 
is going to be difficult with the imminent autumnal leaf fall, so the 
true extent of the disease in the UK may be difficult to establish until
the spring.'

The Forestry Commission today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases.

The Commission has produced a pictorial guide to how to spot the disease. Here are some of the signs:
