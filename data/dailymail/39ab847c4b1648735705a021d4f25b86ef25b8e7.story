Martin Skrtel showed that he's fully recovered from the injury scare that forced him off in Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Blackburn by posing for a photo in Monte Carlo - while wearing a £260 Givenchy t-shirt. 

The centre back was taken off on a stretcher in the first minute after a clash with Rudy Gestede left the Slovakian flat out on the Anfield pitch.

Skrtel took to Instagram where he posted the snap of himself and wife Bara enjoying some time away from England.

The centre back was knocked unconscious and required eight minutes of treatment before being substituted 

Skrtel is currently on a short-break in sunny Monte Carlo, Monaco, before he'll return to help Liverpool in their quest to finish in the Champions League qualification places.

Liverpool travel to Swansea a week on Monday, knowing that a win is vital if they want to keep the pressure on Manchester United and Arsenal. 

Brendan Rodgers side have won their last three meetings with the Welsh outfit and scored an impressive ten goals. 

The last time the two sides met, the Reds comfortably won 4-1 including a double from Adam Lallana and ex-Liverpool man Jonjo Shelvey's own goal.
