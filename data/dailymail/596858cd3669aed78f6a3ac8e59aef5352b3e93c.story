Dennis Rodman today arrived in North Korea insisting that his visit has nothing to do with the politics of the pariah state, where the uncle of leader Kim Jong Un was brutally executed last week.

The eccentric basketball star said he just wanted to 'have some fun' on his trip as he passed through Beijing on his way to Pyongyang.

The 52-year-old has been fiercely criticised over his friendship with Kim, who has imprisoned and murdered thousands of his own impoverished citizens.

Last week, the dictator had his uncle 
Jang Song Thaek publicly purged and then executed, in a vicious U-turn 
against the man who was thought to be one of his closest advisers.

However,
 Mr Rodman has not called off his plan to spend the time between now and
 Christmas Eve in North Korea, and is hoping to return next month to 
play a game of basketball in honour of Kim's birthday.

'It
 has nothing to do with me,' he said in Beijing today. 'Whatever his 
uncle has done, and whoever's done anything in North Korea, I have no 
control over that. I mean, these things have been going on for years and
 years and years,

'I'm just 
going over there to do a basketball game and have some fun. People have 
been saying these things here and there. It doesn't really matter to me.
 I'm not a politician. I'm not an ambassador.'

He added: 'I'm just going over there 
to try and do something really cool for a lot of people, play some games
 and try to get the Korean kids to play.

'Everything
 else I have nothing to do with. If it happens that he wants to talk 
about it then great. If it doesn't happen, I just can't bring it up.'

Despite
 pledging to stay away from politics, the former Chicago Bulls star also
 said he was keen to build bridges between Kim and the U.S. President.

'Sport
 is so important to people around the world so I hope this is going to 
engage the American people, especially Obama,' he added.

Mr Rodman has visited Pyongyang on two 
other occasions, during which he spent time dining as a guest of Kim 
Jong Un, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship.

Defiant: The former Chicago Bulls star said he would not discuss the execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle during his trip to the country

Journey: The star insisted he had no connection to the political issues surrounding North Korea

Training: Rodman is hoping to prepare North Korea's basketball team for a game against ex-NBA stars to celebrate Kim's birthday next month

The visit comes at a time when there also been fears for the safety of the dictator’s wife, Ri Sol Ju.

These
 fears were largely eased when a video was released showing her with Kim
 Jong Un at a memorial service to mark the second anniversary of his 
father's death.

Before then,
 she had not been seen for a number of weeks and her absence from 
official photographs has led to speculation she could have fallen out of
 favour with a husband who is swift to deliver punishment to anyone who 
shows the slightest sign of disloyalty.

‘It's certainly safe, even when there 
is a bit of disruption like there is now - a bit of trouble or chaos - 
there's even more need for cultural or sporting exchanges,’ said Rory 
Scott, a spokesman for Irish bookmakers Paddy Power, which has arranged 
the trip.

Mr
 Rodman is expected to provide North Korea's national basketball team 
with four days of training.

He also intends to return to Pyongyang in 
January with a team of fellow former NBA stars to hold basketball games on Kim Jong Un's birthday.

‘Dennis is 
going to spend a couple of days training the North Korean team to get 
them ship shape for the January match,’ Mr Scott said.

Meanwhile, North
 Korea's young dictator appears to be trying to change the 
country's history as the population mourns the death of his father.

The
 30-year-old leader has purged North Korea's state news archive, even 
removing the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death from two years ago.

On
 Monday, thousands of North Koreans laid flowers outside the state 
mausoleum during a remembrance ceremony for their 'Dear Leader' on the 
second anniversary of his death.
