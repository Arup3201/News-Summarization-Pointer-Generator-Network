His dramatic post-court speech, in which he announced he had saved Casey Anthony's life, drew gasps almost as loud as those that came when the jury found his client not guilty of murdering her young daughter.

It was a rather bold statement to make by defence lawyer of the moment Jose Baez, who has been called 'the luckiest man in America' by one lawyer.

Baez was chosen by Casey Anthony to represent her 'at random', court tapes revealed, after she heard his name mentioned by other prison inmates.

It was a choice many questioned at the time - both among her family and in the legal profession.

Delighted: Man of the moment Jose Baez pulls off the victory of his career

Speaking to the Miami Herald, Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and law professor at Nova Southeastern University, echoed the thoughts of many when he called Baez: 'The luckiest man in America.'

In taking on the job of attempting to clear Anthony of murder charges related to the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, Baez went from being a small-time local lawyer to the defence attorney in the most high-profile case in America.

Jeff Ashton, one of the three 
prosecutors who led the case against Anthony, announced tonight that he 
will retire at the end of the week.

Mr Ashton, 53, has prosecuted for the
 Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office for 30 years.

His reputation and
 experience was in stark contrast to that of Jose Baez, Anthony's lead 
defence attorney, who was admitted to the Florida Bar only three years 
ago.

In 2008, when the decision went public, Richard Hornsby, the president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers, was shocked.

'I first said, "Jose who?" Hornsby told ABC News. 'I had no idea who he was.'

Baez, 42, a Navy veteran, took almost a decade simply to start practising as a professional lawyer. Despite graduating from law school in 1997, he was was perennially denied entry to the Florida bar until 2005 - because he refused to pay child support to his former wife or secure life and health insurance for his teenage daughter.

He had previously declared himself bankrupt and defaulted on loans, according to an order by the Supreme Court of Florida.

As a result, he was barred from the bar for eight years, because, according to the Florida Supreme Court, the financial marks on his name showed 'a lack of respect for the rights of others and a total lack of respect for the legal system, which is absolutely inconsistent with the character and fitness qualities required of those seeking to be afforded the highest position of trust and confidence recognised by our system of law.'

'It kind of happened at random in booking.

'I
 heard a couple of people talking about attorneys... His name came up and
 I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along'

Casey Anthony on why she hired Baez

The decision to hire Baez was also criticised by Anthony's family.

In jail house tapes from July 2008 played to the court, Lee Anthony, Casey's brother, warned her to switch attorneys.

Understand your rights in this... If at any point you want to change jockeys in this horse race, you can do it…it's as simple as you reaching out to anyone in the Corrections Department…and make it known on what you want to do,' he told his sister.

Her father George Anthony added: 'I just, I hope that the compassion that he says that he has is being 
genuine…I hope he's not building a reputation for himself.'

When Lee probed her on how she came to hire Baez, Casey explained: 'It kind of happened at random in booking.

'I heard a couple of people talking about attorneys...His name came up and I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along…It was an inmate and there was three other people that confirmed it.'

In court, Baez faced much media criticism for what appeared to be a series of bold and dangerous moves, which could have scuppered his defence case.

He was slammed, in particular, almost daily by notorious host Nancy Grace for his choice of argument in court and for 'relishing in the spotlight' outside of it, supposedly using the case as an opportunity for fame.

In his opening statements, Baez stunned onlookers by claiming his client had lied all along about what had happened to her daughter.

Furious: Nancy Grace has continually argued against Baez's tactics in court

She was no longer arguing that a nanny had taken her for a month before her disappearance was reported but that a tragic accident in her parents' swimming pool led to them attempting to cover up little Caylee's death.

Baez then told the court she had lied
 because of psychological problems that stemmed from Casey having been 
sexually abused by her father - a claim he completely denied.

'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez'

Nancy Grace on the verdict

Once the new story was established, Baez essentially backed himself into a corner, critics argued.

The
 only witness who could corroborate these bold claims was Casey herself 
and legal experts almost always warn against bringing one's client to 
the stand.

As it transpired, the claims were never backed up and Casey did not give evidence.

Baez
 was heavily criticised throughout the case by notorious host Nancy 
Grace and was labelled 'incompetent' on one of her shows.

Speaking
 with defence attorney Raymond Giudice about testimony instigated by 
Baez that Caylee's remains may have been tampered with by woodland 
animals, Grace said: 'You know what? Maybe it was a dingo dog or 
Sasquatch or Bigfoot or a martian!

'You
 know what? I really think -- you know, I see you laughing, but here`s 
the deal.. The defence can`t laugh. They've done it now. They can sit 
there and laugh in open court. What were they thinking?  A coyote did 
it?'

Different: Baez was criticised for using so many posters and charts in court

Giudice responded: 'We`re seeing is an entire team, not just Mr Baez, their incompetency.'

After the not guilty verdict was announced today, Grace said rather ungraciously: 'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez.'

Baez had been practising as a lawyer for just three years when he was booked by Anthony.

In his highest profile case before the Anthony trial, he defended a Nilton Diaz, a man accused of killing the granddaughter of a boxer.

After Diaz was convicted of manslaughter, the client filed a 
motion arguing that Baez was a defective attorney, although his motion was denied.

While he was waiting to be admitted to the bar he worked with two bikini businesses - Bon Bon Bikinis and Brazilian-Bikinis.com, which are both now inactive.

He also worked for not for profit organisations which fought to prevent domestic violence and child abuse.

While his profile has soared since the Anthony trial began, Baez's financial troubles have not ceased.

'Saved a life': Baez addresses the media after the historic result

His home was in foreclosure last 
year, according to reports, and it is unclear how he was paid to 
represent Anthony, although money from sales of pictures and footage of 
Caylee are thought to have contributed.

'He's
 a guy with a colourful and complicated past and a very confusing 
present,' Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and professor at Nova Southeastern 
University Law Center told ABC News during the case.

'His courtroom demeanour leaves you with a sense that this is a guy who is in over his head.

'He's really flying by the seat of his pants. From his very confusing open, from the way he's been cross examining witnesses, at this point, you really have to wonder what his strategy is.'

Despite all the criticism, however, today's result is an undoubted milestone success for the attorney - which is perhaps why he so basked in the moment.

Turnaround: Baez won despite claims he took the job for fame

As the clerk of the court read the verdicts, Anthony hugged Baez and soon after began to cry.

Later, as the judge spoke to the jury, she could be seen mouthing 
'thank you' to him, before the whole defence team hugged in tears like a victorious sports team as the
 session ended.

In a bizarre speech given after the case in both English and Spanish, Baez appeared shaken with emotion as he shamelessly declared that his defence had ‘saved a life’.

He told the media he was ‘very happy for Casey. I’m ecstatic for her and I want her to be able to grieve and grow and somehow get her life back together’ but spent much of the speech focussed on how the moment felt for him.

He used to opportunity to speak out against Casey’s ‘trial by media’ and the death penalty, which he labelled ‘disgusting’, before saying: ‘I want to thank everyone who stood behind me and supported me throughout this time.’

The speech then reached its climax as, holding back tears, Baez declared he was especially proud that when he went home this evening his daughter ‘will ask me what did you do today and I can say I saved a life.’
