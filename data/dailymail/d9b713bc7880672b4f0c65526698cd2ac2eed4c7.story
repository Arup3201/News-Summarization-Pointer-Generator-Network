A glow-in-the-dark cockroach, a harp-shaped carnivorous sponge and the smallest frog on Earth are among the most bizarre newly discovered species of 2012, chosen by scientists.

Also slithering into this year's top ten is a snail-eating false coral snake, as well as flowering bushes from a disappearing forest in Madagascar.

A green lacewing that was discovered through social media and hanging flies that perfectly mimicked ginkgo tree leaves 165 million years ago were also included by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University.

The International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University has compiled a list of the ten best newly discovered species of 2012. They include a glow-in-the-dark cockroach, a green lacewing that was first discovered through Flickr, and a frog that is only 7mm big. A total of 140 species were nominated

Tiny Violet - Viola lilliputana

Found: Peru

Carnivorous sponge - Chondrocladia lyra

Found: Pacific Ocean, California

Lesula Monkey - Cercopithecus lomamiensis

Found: Democratic Republic of the Congo

Snail-eating snake - Sibon noalamina

Found: Panama

Fungus -  Ochroconis anomala

Found: France

7mm frog - Paedophryne amanuensis

Found: New Guinea

Endangered forest plant - Eugenia petrikensis

Found: Madagascar

Glow-in-the-dark cockroach - Lucihormetica luckae

Country: Ecuador

Flickr butterfly - Semachrysa jade

Country: Malaysia

Hanging fly fossil -  Juracimbrophlebia ginkgofolia

Country: China

Rounding up the list is a new monkey with a blue backside and human-like eyes, a tiny violet and a black staining fungus that threatens rare Paleolithic cave paintings in France.

The weird and wonderful creatures were all identified for the first time in 2012.

They make it into a list published each year by a global committee of taxonomists, scientists responsible for species exploration and classification.

Professor Quentin Wheeler, founding director of the group, said: 'We have identified only about two million of an estimated 10 to 12 million living species and that does not count most of the microbial world.

'For decades, we have averaged 18,000 species discoveries per year which seemed reasonable before the biodiversity crisis.

Now, knowing that millions of species may not survive the 21st century, it is time to pick up the pace.

Members made their selection from more than 140 nominated species.

To be
 considered, species must have been described in compliance with the 
appropriate code of nomenclature, whether botanical, zoological or 
microbiological, and have been officially named during 2012.

Nominations for the 2014 list - for species described in 2013 - can now be made online.

Previous top ten lists from the past six years are available from the Arizona State University website.

This glow-in-the dark cockroach was discovered last year in Ecuador. Its official name is Lucihormetica luckae and it uses luminescence to create its glow. More than a dozen luminescent cockroaches have been discovered since 1999 and this latest addition is thought to now  be endangered, or even extinct. Only one specimen has been found

A new species of snail-eating snake was discovered in Serranía de Tabasará mountain range in Panama. The snake is nocturnal and hunts soft-bodied prey including earthworms and amphibian eggs, as well as snails and slugs. The snake is not a threat to humans and can ward off prey by mimicking the dark and light rings found on venomous coral snakes. Its name comes from the Spanish phrase 'No a la mina' or 'No to the mine.'

Biologist Dr Antonio Valdecasas, of the Museum of Natural Sciences, 
Madrid, said: 'Selecting the final list of new species from a wide 
representation of life forms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and 
animals, is difficult.

'It requires finding an equilibrium between certain criteria and the special insights revealed by selection committee members.

'We
 look for organisms with unexpected features or size and those found in 
rare or difficult to reach habitats.

We also look for organisms that are
 especially significant to humans - those that play a certain role in 
human habitat or that are considered a close relative.'

This carnivorous sponge, called Chondrocladia lyra was found in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. It lives in water that averages 3,339 metres deep and has large, harp- or lyre-shaped vanes, with more than 20 parallel vertical branches, often found with a balloon-like ball on the top. This unusual shape maximizes the surface area of the sponge for contact and capture of planktonic prey

This year's top ten came from Peru, the Pacific Ocean off the north east
 US coast, California, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Panama, 
France, New Guinea, Madagascar, Ecuador, Malaysia and China.

Wheeler said: 'I don't know whether to be more astounded by
 the species discovered each year, or the depths of our ignorance about 
biodiversity of which we are a part.

'At the same time we search the 
heavens for other earthlike planets, we should make it a high priority 
to explore the biodiversity on the most earthlike planet of them all: 
Earth.

Discovered in the Lomami Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the lesula is an Old World monkey. It is is only the second species of monkey discovered in Africa in the past 28 years. Scientists first saw the monkey as a captive juvenile in 2007. Researchers describe it as having human-like eyes. Although the forests where the monkeys live are remote, the species is hunted for bush meat and its status is vulnerable

Adult male lesula monkeys, found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is an Old World monkey well known to locals but newly known to science. Adult males have a large, bare patch of bright blue skin on the buttocks, testicles and perineum, pictured

'With more than eight out of every ten living species awaiting
 discovery, I am shocked by our ignorance of our very own planet and in 
awe at the diversity, beauty and complexity of the biosphere and its 
inhabitants.'

Added Prof Wheeler: 'We are calling for a NASA-like mission to discover 10 million species in the next 50 years. This would lead to discovering countless options for a more sustainable future while securing evidence of the origins of the biosphere.'

The announcement, now in its sixth year, coincides with the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus - the 18th century Swedish botanist responsible for the modern system of scientific names and classifications.

The world's smallest violet, pictured left, is only found in the Intermontane Plateau of the high Andes
 of Peru. It is called the Lillipution violet after named after the race of 
little people on the island of Lilliput in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s 
Travels. The fossil shown on the right is of a hanging fly and was found along with preserved leaves of a gingko-like tree, in Middle
 Jurassic deposits from China’s Inner 
Mongolia. This discovery is a rare example of an insect mimicking a gymnosperm 165 million
 years ago
