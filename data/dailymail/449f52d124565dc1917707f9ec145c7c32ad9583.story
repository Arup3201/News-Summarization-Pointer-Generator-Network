A love-rat groom has been banned from contacting his new wife - after he had a fling with his wedding hairdresser.

Harry McNeil, 23, from Brecon in Mid Wales, married his childhood sweetheart Bronwen Phillips in November last year but split a fortnight after tying the knot when she discovered the romance.

But after the affair with stylist Alexandra Kotri turned sour, McNeil resorted to winning his wife, who he had been with for six years, back and began bombarding her with texts, a court heard.

The estate agent had been warned not to contact Ms Phillips, 24, after her solicitor told him to stay away from her home in the Welsh town.

Brecon Magistrates Court was told he sent dozens of texts and phone calls to Ms Philips before going to her house, banging on the letterbox and pushing the door last month.

Prosecutor Julie Sullivan told the court: ‘Just before 1am on December 17th, police received a call to attend an address in Brecon as it was reported McNeil was outside harassing Bronwen Phillips.

‘The call was made by Ms Phillips’ mother who was on the phone to her daughter at the time.

Bronwen Phillips, 24, found out about the affair two weeks after she married McNeil and then separated

‘The defendant and Ms Phillips had married on November 1st following a six-year relationship but two weeks later had separated.

‘On November 16th the defendant sent texts to the victim pleading for her forgiveness and said he wanted her back and that he loved her.

‘She received approximately 14 messages and nine or 10 calls. The defendant was warned by the victim’s solicitor, who she had instructed in divorce proceedings, not to contact Ms Phillips.

‘On December 17th the defendant turned up at the victim’s house and began banging on the door, banging the letterbox and pushing the door in an attempt to get in.

‘He shouted through the letterbox “I’ll stay here all night”. The victim didn’t answer and hid in the living room out of sight.

‘She could see he was taking photos through the letterbox as she could see the flash. She knew he had been drinking.'

Ms Sullivan said that when police arrived McNeil was still outside the property and was taken away to be interviewed. 

‘He said he’d been in a relationship with Bronwen Phillips and deeply regretted what had occurred and wanted to get back together and had sent between 20 to 30 messages.

McNeil was given a restraining order after he bombarded his wife with texts and calls

‘He said he’d left his wife for a brief relationship with the hairdresser at their wedding. He acknowledged he’d been given advice not to contact his wife.

‘He said soon after he’d entered the other relationship, he’d realised he’d made a mistake.’ 

The prosecutor said McNeil even texted his wife after his arrest: ‘The final message was sent while the defendant was in the back of the police car. 

'He told her he’d been arrested, he loved her and wanted to talk to her.’

Magistrates heard he also used the WhatsApp messaging app to contact Ms Phillips, which meant he could see she had read his messages but was not answering them.

McNeil, who represented himself at the hearing, told police he had been trying to take a photo through the letterbox to see if there was key in the lock. 

He was given a nine-month community order with six months supervision and a requirement he attend the respectful relationships course. 

The restraining order prevents McNeil from contacting Ms Phillips by any means or from attending at her home.

He must also do 100 hours unpaid work and pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

Hairdresser Ms Kortri, who advertises on Facebook as 'Alexandra's Mobile Hairdressing', admitted the fling but said the relationship was over.

‘All I want to say it the relationship is over. It only lasted a couple of weeks.' she said.
