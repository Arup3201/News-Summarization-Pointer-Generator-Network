This morning I woke up alone again, as I do every morning. I nipped down to the kitchen to make a plate of hot buttered toast and brought it back to bed, where I switched on the radio, lay back and tucked in, happily scattering crumbs all over the sheets.

My husband Tom and I hadn't had an argument, nor is our sex life a thing of the past. Quite the reverse.

Ever since my husband and I decided to sleep in separate bedrooms five years ago, our marriage has been happier and more fulfilling than ever.

'Best thing I ever did': Rachel is highly pleased with the restorative effects sleeping in a separate bedroom to her husband has had

As I listened to Tom's footsteps in the hallway, I smiled mischievously as I recalled our wonderful 'date' in his bedroom yesterday evening, which ended with a kiss goodnight before I tiptoed back to my own boudoir.

I've always believed that deciding to sleep alone was the best thing I ever did. And this week I learned that I am in some very good royal company.

In an interview, Princess Michael of Kent revealed that she and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms so they are 'fresher' for each other. Since they've been married for 35 years, they're clearly doing something right.

Sharing a marital bed is a peculiarly British thing. Continentals are far less keen, and America's National Association of Home Builders says 60 per cent of new homes are likely to have dual master bedrooms by 2015.

So why do it? Well, please understand, I love my husband dearly and the physical attraction between us remains as strong as the day we met. But between his snoring and my fidgeting, we just could not get along while we were sharing a duvet.

Tom and I met in 2001 when I was a political correspondent for GMTV and he worked at the Ministry of Defence.

Although he's 23 years older than me, I fell for him instantly. Born in Fiji, he joined the RAF at 17, flew all over the world and fought in two wars - a definite Alpha male, with dark skin, a deep voice and one infuriating habit.

Like 40 per cent of the men in this country, Tom snores - very loudly, every night, without fail. Only last week, a survey revealed that more than half of all couples find snoring the most annoying habit in bed, and one in ten of us would rather sleep with a pet than our partner.

For me, sleepless nights became a fact of life. But Tom was so lovely in every other way that I felt compelled to try to turn a deaf ear to a habit he couldn't really help.

This went on for four years until 2005 when Tom and I separated. He already had three children from his first marriage and, at 57, was adamant he didn't want to start another family. I desperately wanted a child, so we split.

We were apart for just over one miserable year before Tom managed to woo me back with the promise that we would marry and start a family. I was delighted - but I didn't feel the same way about his snoring. Our first few weeks back together were heaven by day, hell-on-earth by night.

'Night after glorious night, I go to sleep and stay asleep.'

Ear plugs, anti-snoring sprays and nasal strips made zero impact. So I made Tom consult his doctor, who told him that his sonorous habit was thanks to some boxing he had done as a young man that had left him with a deviated septum.

On the basis that it would be painful and might not even work, he firmly declined the suggested surgery - and my thoughts turned murderous.

On a short break to Spain soon afterwards, things became so bad that I woke Tom and yelled at him: 'If you don't stop snoring, I am going to punch you really, really hard. Please go and sleep in the bathroom.'

Tom argued that since I was the only person affected, I was the one who should sleep in the bathroom.

And so it was that I took myself off to a cold, tiled floor, next to a dripping tap, too exhausted to fight any longer.

Once we got home, I just told Tom straight: 'I want to sleep in the spare room.'

Much to my amazement, he greeted the idea warmly.

'Thank goodness for that!' he said. 'I had been trying to think of a way to tell you that your fidgeting and getting up to the loo so many times in the night is driving me insane.'

Good night's sleep: Now Rachel doesn't have to be pestered by Tom's annoying nocturnal habits

And so, five years ago, I moved into the spare room. I go to bed early with a hot-water bottle (even in summer, as I have the coldest feet) and read a book. I eat chocolate and crisps in bed and get crumbs everywhere - a habit Tom can't stand.

Night after glorious night, I go to sleep and stay asleep.

By contrast Tom goes to bed very late and watches television with the windows open, even in winter.

Friends say we're missing out on those spontaneous moments of intimacy and early-morning cuddles. But, in reality, people wake up with morning breath and flatulence, not in a romantic embrace.

Intimacy may feel like it's 'on tap' when you share the same bed, but in my experience, couples who know they can do it any time actually end up doing it very little. But when you have separate beds, you make time for each other out of desire, not out of habit.

After our son, Tanoa, was born in September 2012, he slept in my room because I was breastfeeding. Now, each night Tom and I take turns to have the baby monitor in our room and get up if he wakes. Since he has slept 11 hours a night since he was six months old, that's never been an issue.

In fact, our sleeping arrangements are so stress-free all round, that I have been recommending it as a foolproof way of reinvigorating a relationship.

After all, there's not much that can't be improved by the restorative power of a really good night's sleep.
