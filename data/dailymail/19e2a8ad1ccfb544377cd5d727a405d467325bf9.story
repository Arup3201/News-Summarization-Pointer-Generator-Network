Benefits chiefs have ruled that a former forklift driver who had a leg amputated following a workplace accident and is recovering from an operation on his other leg is fit to work.

Darren Gilligan, 35, has been told that he failed to meet the criteria to receive Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) because he did not score enough points on a medical assessment form.

The decision marks the second time that the single 
father-of-two has had his ESA benefits rejected - the first was shortly 
before he had his leg amputated last August.

It comes as Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions 
Secretary, today said that losing a limb should not automatically entitle people to a payout.

He
pledged to push ahead with controversial reforms that will see two 
million disability claimants reassessed over the next four years under 
plans to save the taxpayer billions of pounds.

He
said: ‘It is a gauge of your capability. In other words, do you need 
care? Do you need support to get around? Those are the two things that 
are measured. Not “You have lost a limb”.'

Mr Duncan Smith was referring to a new, more stringent benefit called Personal Independence Payment which will replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).

Last August's decision against Mr Gilligan receiving ESA was eventually overturned when he appealed and he continued to receive £188 every fortnight.

Mr Gilligan said: 'It's ludicrous. When they did a U-turn last time I still had both my legs but now I've actually had the amputation I'm worse off than before and there are other health complications.

'But they are saying I'm fit to work - I'm clearly not.'

Fightback: Mr Gilligan now plans to appeal with the help of letters from his GP, consultants and physiotherapists

Mr Gilligan, of Baildon, West Yorkshire, had been getting used to his false leg when he fell and tore ligaments in his other knee, for which he underwent an operation on Thursday.

He said: 'I'm wheelchair-bound because I can't bear any weight and I get chronic backache. I want to work when I'm well enough and have learned to walk on my new leg but that's not possible now.

'I'm not a scrounger. I want to go back to work, I'm a proud man. I'm not trying to pull a fast one.

'All I want is to be left to get better, this is no life and it is so frustrating because there is nothing you can do.'

Mr Gilligan, who lives with his daughters Charlotte and Amy, both 12, said he had been for an assessment about two months ago, before finding out the decision last week.

He now plans to appeal with the help of letters from his GP, consultants and physiotherapists - all of who, he said, agree he cannot return to work.

He said: 'I will appeal and with all the specialists behind me I should get the extra points I need.

'I was told I only had 12 points towards getting my ESA - six for having one leg, another six for being depressed and I need another three apparently.

'Everyone I speak to is flabbergasted. If you can breathe and blink they want you back to work.'

Mr Gilligan added: 'As soon as I can wear my leg all day - not even all day - I could do part-time between the leg and wheelchair. As soon as the other leg gets stable enough so I can put on the false leg I want to work. 

'I'm sure I could do some type of manual labour. If it wasn't for my injured leg I would be up and about ready to work. I would even do voluntary work. I just want to help myself.'

Should amputees be forced to work?

Paul Anderson, of Bradford & District Disabled People's Forum, said 42 per cent of people in Bradford were winning their appeals against ESA judgements, which showed how 'ridiculous' the entitlement process was.

He said: 'It's causing a lot of stress and unnecessary worry because of the way the assessment and scoring process is so unfair and so unrealistic.

'Disabled people want to be given the opportunity to work but some people need more support and also jobs they can do are not always available.'

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'We shouldn't automatically write off a person's ability to work, solely on the basis of a health condition or disability.

'That's why the Work Capability Assessment doesn't focus on a particular diagnosis, but on the actual abilities of an individual, and whether that person - with the right support - could undertake suitable work.

'People who are too sick or disabled will continue to receive our unconditional support, but those who are able to work will get specialist help through the Work Programme.'
