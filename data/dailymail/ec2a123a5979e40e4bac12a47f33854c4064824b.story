Two singles in their seventies who married after a chance meeting at a blues concert have proved that love can come at any age.

Margie Goldsmith, a 70-year-old travel writer who lives in New York City, had been divorced twice and no longer had marriage on her mind when she met Jamie Anthony, a 71-year-old retired insurance executive, at the Triad NYC, a theater on Manhattan's Upper West Side, in July 2012.

'I had completely decided that it absolutely was not worth it. I'd done it twice and that was enough,' Ms Goldsmith told DailyMail.com.

Just married: Margie Goldsmith, a 70-year-old travel writer who lives in New York City, wed Jamie Anthony, 71, on December 13 after meeting at a blues show in 2012

'I was very happy with my life as it was. I was living a life as a complete person with a lot of friends. And I didn't feel I had to have a man. I think if you get to a certain age, you get over that - you don't need to have a man in your life,' she added.

She and Mr Anthony, who had also been divorced twice and has three grown children, struck up a conversation about their mutual love of the blues after he noticed that her friend was wearing a shirt from the Shack Up Inn in Mississippi, where Mr Anthony had stayed many times.

'I thought he was absolutely charming and I loved his Southern accent,' she recalled of Mr Anthony, who grew up in Sandy Springs, Georgia, and now produces blues bands. 'I was thrilled to meet someone who had a similar passion.'

One day later, he invited her to Maplewoodstock, a music festival near his home in Maplewood, New Jersey. The following weekend, he asked her to take a ride on his motorcycle.

'The moment he told me he loved motorcyles, I thought oh God, he's got to have tattoos all over his body. He's probably got black leather, he's got chains and he rides a Harley. But I liked him enough to be willing to give it a go,' she said.

First impression: 'I thought he was absolutely charming and I loved his Southern accent,' Ms Goldsmith recalled of Mr Anthony

However, she found the ride exhilarating, telling the New York Times: 'Riding behind him was very sensual. You can choose how much to put your arms around him. I put my arms around him a lot. We were like two teenagers on our first date. By the time we made it back to the city, I was hooked.'

The pair went on to experience other adventures together, including a motorcycle ride in the rain on Bavaria's Romantic Road, during which they got lost, not speaking a word of German, and ended up in Austria.

It was in Germany that Ms Goldsmith began to realize the relationship was serious, she added to DailyMail.com.

'It was the first time I'd been away with him for more than two or three nights and he was really easy to be with and we had the same values. And I was very attracted to him, which I hadn't been in a very long time. I had just met a lot of men whom I couldn't wait to get away from after a cup of coffee,' she said.

On a subsequent trip to Bali, where Ms Goldsmith was working on a story assignment, Mr. Anthony proposed in Balinese, telling her: 'I will love you forever. Please be a part of my life.'

The couple married on December 13 at Mr. Anthony’s church, Prospect Presbyterian in Maplewood.

Happy couple: 'He was really easy to be with and we had the same values,' Ms Goldsmith said of Mr Anthony

Ms Goldsmith said she was eager to gain 13 new family members, including Mr Anthony's son and two daughters, and their spouses and children.

She found an instant rapport with his daughter Ashlee, whom she met on their first date at Maplewoodstock, and was impressed that all three children were 'so beautifully brought up, and so polite'.

Ms Goldsmith said that there are two secrets to a happy marriage.

'First of all, respecting the other one's feelings and compromising instead of blowing up or getting resentful. But even before that, being open about your feelings,' she said.

'In both other marriages, I just let the resentment seethe inside of me. I was too afraid to express what I really felt because I thought each respective husband would get angry. But now that I'm older and wiser, I have no trouble telling Jamie if something bothers me and he does the same. I think the resentments are what drive people to divorce. It's empowering to be able to say what you feel.'

Ms Goldsmith has kept her apartment in New York City, where she likes to write in her office, while Mr Anthony will maintain his residence in South Orange, New Jersey, where he's since moved, so that neither has to compromise their lifestyle. The couple will spend weekends together and plan dinner dates during the week.

Ms Goldsmith said: 'I think at 20, or 30, or 40, as a woman, you're looking for someone to complete you. Even the second time around, you kind of lose your identity to a man. If you were brought up in an age when your mother said find a guy, marry him and  darn his socks and cook his meals, you become an appendage of your husband and you lose whatever identity is your own.

'But when you're 70, if you choose to get married, you have your identity, you're not about to lose it. And if you're marrying someone who's also 70, then they understand that. They're not going to try to mold you into something they want you to be.'
