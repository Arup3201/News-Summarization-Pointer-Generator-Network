Sex offenders will face tougher checks, ministers announced today - after the Mail revealed more than 850 are on the run from the police.

The Home Office will close a string of loopholes in the official register of sex criminals - including one which allowed offenders to register their address as a park bench.

Homeless sex offenders who did not have a permanent address were able to nominate a public place where they slept as their home and keep it for an entire year.

In future they will be forced to check in with the police every week and notify the authorities if they are moving around.

Anyone on the register who travels 
abroad will have to tell the police even for trips as short as a day. In
the past notification was not required for holidays shorter than three 
days.

They must also tell the police if 
they move into a house where a child lives, and notify officers of any 
attempts to change their name by deed poll.

The crack down comes after figures, 
released following a Freedom of Information request, showed 700 sex 
offenders have been missing for more than a year,  and one has been at 
large for nearly a decade.

The total means the number of  perverts who have vanished from the radar has more than doubled in just two years.

The figures raised serious concerns about the extent of police checks on criminals placed on the official Sex Offenders’ Register, and efforts to find them once they have absconded.

Victims’ groups said the register was ‘out of control’ and warned that sex offenders were getting away with staying ‘underground and undetected’.

Anyone given a jail sentence of 30 months or more for a sex crime, ranging from repeated indecent exposure to rape, is automatically placed on the register for life. There are now more than 37,000 names on it.

But figures show that on September 1 last year a total of 843 had  disappeared. Of those, some 690 had been untraceable for more than 12 months. On the same day in 2009 there were just 356 registered sex offenders at large, fewer than half the 2011 number.

The numbers at large for more than a year have also more than doubled. Two years ago the total stood at 260.

Now the figures released following a Freedom of Information request to the National Policing Improvement Agency show more than one in 50 of all those on the register are missing.

Separate figures reveal that 57 registered sex offenders were charged with a further offence last year.

An example of an offender who 
disappeared was serial rapist Peter Chapman, who was off the police 
radar for seven months after his monitoring level was downgraded by the 
authorities.

He went on to rape and murder 17-year-old Ashleigh Hall after contacting her on Facebook.

Chapman posed as a teenager on the internet to lure the trainee nurse to her death. He was jailed for life in 2010.

Lynn Costello, of Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, said: ‘The figures don’t surprise me because nobody has really had a control of the sex offenders register since it was brought in.

‘These people are offenders who want to move around and remain underground and undetected.

‘But all the blame for this cannot be put at the doors of the police. How many paedophiles can be tracked down when the police are being asked to do so much paperwork?’

Home Secretary Theresa May said the ruling for sex offenders to be taken of the register after an amount of time was 'appalling'

Despite the huge numbers of criminals at large, barely a handful of sex offenders are listed on police wanted websites.

The ‘Most Wanted’ page of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) website shows the details of just two missing child sex offenders.

Jason Waller, 35, has been missing for
four years. He was sentenced to three years for assaulting three 
children, but disappeared in 2008.

Stephen
Clare, 40, has been off the radar for nine years. He was jailed for 
sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl and taking indecent photographs
in the 1990s.

He served 18
months and was released from jail in 1998, when he moved to Brighton. 
Police said decisions on whether to publicise individual offenders would
depend on the circumstances in each case, and work was being done 
behind the scenes to hunt offenders down.

Cumbria
Assistant Chief Constable Michelle Skeer, spokesman for the Association
of Chief Police Officers on the management of sexual offenders, said 
monitoring was working and fewer serious offences were being committed 
by dangerous offenders.

She said: ‘The UK has some of the most effective techniques in the world to manage registered sex offenders.’

Ministers have 
also announced the process by which sex offenders will be able to challenge 
their inclusion on the register for life.

All offenders placed on the register 
indefinitely have been given appeal rights following a human rights 
judgment by the Supreme Court in 2010.

From later this year, adults who have
been on the register for 15 years will be able to appeal to the police 
and if there is no evidence they remain a threat, they will be taken 
off.

If the decision goes against them 
they will be given a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Court who could
overturn the police ruling.

The Supreme Court agreed with two 
convicted sex offenders that no right of review was 'incompatible' with 
their right to privacy.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the ruling was 'appalling' and 'seems to fly completely in the face of common sense'.
