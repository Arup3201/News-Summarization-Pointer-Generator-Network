Glenn Hoddle has left QPR following the shock resignation of manager Harry Redknapp on Tuesday.

The former England manager was part of the backroom team at Rangers, and confirmed his departure from Loftus Road several hours after Redknapp's announcement citing the fact he needed double knee surgery.

'I am a bit shocked and surprised, to tell you the truth,' Hoddle told ZapSportz. 'We all know football is a results-orientated business but I always felt that given a few more games, Harry could have turned it around down there at the bottom.

'It would have only taken a couple of good results to have achieved that as it is very tight down there.

'But that’s football for you. I have enjoyed coming back into coaching and I thanked Harry for giving me that opportunity to tip my toe back into the coaching arena.

'I have enjoyed every minute. I wished him all the best and I do sincerely hope QPR can stay up. I would love the players to turn it around as I have enjoyed working with them – and hope I have improved them.'

Sportsmail understands that Joe Jordan will also depart the club. 

Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey will take temporary charge as QPR prepare to face Southampton at home in the Premier League on Saturday.
