She's made no secret of her desire to be a film star and it seems that Cara Delevingne may have struck gold - or grey- with her latest move.

The 20-year-old model has reportedly auditioned for a highly coveted role in the hotly anticipated Fifty Shades Of Grey movie.

Cara, who has seen her star rapidly rise this year, apparently impressed producers in her audition  for the movie adaptation of E.L. James' erotic trilogy.

There really is no stopping her! Model Cara Delevingne is said to have auditioned for a secondary character role in the film adaption of E.L. James' Fifty Shades Of Grey

A source told The Sun: 'Cara is a front-runner for a part. She's desperate to get the gig and 
has always said that she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.'

Insiders have revealed that Cara became close friends with actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson during her film debut in the 2012 Hollywood remake of Anna Karenina, alongside Keira Knightley and Jude Law.

And it just so happens that Aaron's wife Sam Taylor Wood is directing the upcoming Fifty Shades movie.

The source added: '[Cara] is a 
global icon now and a good actress as well and Sam wants her in the 
movie – though which part exactly hasn't been established.

'[Cara's] agent has also been talking to
Kelly Marcel, the screenplay writer. And, if needs be, a strong role 
will be written in for her.'

Anyone who has been following the model of the year, they will know that ambitious Cara doesn't just settle for one job at a time.

The supermodel, who walked in over 30 shows in fashion week last season, will also appear in Kids In Love, a drama about hard-partying young Londoners.

Speaking about the film, a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The film is all about rich kids who live a wild lifestyle filled with parties and drugs.

Good contacts: Cara is said to have become good 
friends with Aaron Taylor-Johnson whilst starring in Hollywood hit Anna 
Karenina, and now his wife Sam is producing the Fifty Shades Of Grey 
movie

‘So some aspects of the storyline will not be a particularly big stretch for Cara,’ said a friend of the model, who is regularly out at the capital’s hotspots with the likes of Rihanna.

‘It will be Cara’s first big screen role, so she’s really excited about it and is eager to make sure that she does a good job. Her name in itself will obviously be a big draw for the film too.’

And film work is not the end of Cara’s ambition. The blonde starlet, who heads to Ibiza next week to celebrate her 21st birthday, is also keen to break into the music industry.

She recently begged rapper Pharrell Williams, who performed on summertime hit Get Lucky, to team up for some recording studio sessions after starring in a shoot with him in Vogue's September Issue.

Could 2014 be an even bigger year for the non-stop model?

Ever since the movie rights for Fifty Shades Of Grey were sold to Universal Pictures and Focus Features, the potential cast rumour mill went into overdrive.

So just who will play the role of Anastasia and Christian Grey?

So far, actors hotly tipped to play the mysterious Christian are Robert Pattinson, Chris Pine, William Levy, Joshua Bowman, James Deen, Hayden Christensen and Alexander Skarsgård.

As for 
innocent Ana, firm favorites are Lauren Watson, Emilia Clarke, Lucy 
Hale, Alexis Bledel, Emma Watson and Elizabeth Olsen.
