Hollywood star Johnny Depp is renowned for not wasting his beer, but it was a spill of a very different kind that saw him flying back to the US.

The actor is rumoured to have broken his right wrist go-karting on a private track at five-time MotoGP world champion Mick Doohan’s luxurious Coomera property last weekend.

Depp has been based at the sprawling waterfront compound since he arrived on the Gold Coast last month, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.

The 51-year-old actor will require surgery  after injuring his right hand on Australia's Gold Coast while filming the latest installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movie franchise.

Johnny, who was not on the set of the fifth Pirates movie when the mystery ailment occurred, appeared with his hand taped up and he seemed to be favouring it as he held it close to his chest.

However, despite needing surgery, which he voluntarily chose to return to the United States for, Johnny appeared to be in jovial spirits, smiling and waving at fans as he made his way onto the plane. 

He even showed that the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is still in the foremost of his thoughts, as his bandage featured a skull and crossbones.

The incident is expected to only cause a short delay to filming of the movie, in which Johnny reprises his iconic role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the lucrative fantasy franchise.

It is said Mr Depp will be overseas for two weeks during which his absence will only 'minimally' affect production as other scenes are filmed.

The spokesperson also said the film's release date will still be July 2017.

It is not clear if Johnny's new wife Amber Heard, 28, who he married last month, will be in LA to look after him when he arrives.
