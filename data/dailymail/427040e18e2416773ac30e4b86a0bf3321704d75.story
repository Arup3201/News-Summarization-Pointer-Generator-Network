A woman neglected her dog so badly it was found 'starving' and 'unable to stand'.

Kathleen Crowley's Alsatian was found buried under a pile of bikes in her garden and was so malnourished and ill it had to be put down.

The dog was discovered by an RSPCA officer who visited Crowley's home in Canterbury Avenue, Bradford, West Yorkshire, last year.

The Alsatian was so badly neglected when found in Kathleen Crowley's garden it had to be put down

Bradford and Keighley Magistrates Court heard that the animal had suffered such abuse it was impossible to save it.

Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the dog was taken to the vets where it unfortunately had to be put down.

He described how floors in the house were 'filthy' and the kitchen 'covered with dirt and grime'.

On Tuesday, the 48-year-old was handed a two-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, for failing to provide the dog, and three bull terriers, with a suitable environment.

Maria Temkow, defending, said she had health difficulties and was unable to look after herself or the animals.

Neighbours complained the stench from Kathleen Crowley's filthy garden was so bad they could not have their windows open in the summer

Speaking from her home yesterday, Crowley said: 'There was nothing I could do, the dog was quite old.

'I didn't mean to hurt the dog. I wasn't able to clean the house or the garden.'

Her partner David Wright, 46, and 
her daughter Vanessa Crowley, 21, who both live with her, pleaded guilty
to failing to provide dogs with a suitable environment.

Vanessa
Crowley was handed a 12-month community order with a 15-day activity 
condition and ordered to complete 60 hours of unpaid work.

Wright was also given a 12-month community order and told to complete 50 hours' unpaid work.

They were also banned from keeping animals for life.

The defendants were ordered to pay £260 towards costs, which totalled more than £5,000.

A neighbour, who lived next-door to the defendants, said: 'I have seen the dog on a few occasions in the garden whimpering.

'The dog always looked tired and unenergetic.

'The smell was so bad that in the summer we could not even open the windows.'
