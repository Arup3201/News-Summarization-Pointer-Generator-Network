 'That's football, it always surprises you.' Arsene Wenger's first response to Yaya Sanogo's performance on Saturday was one that was replicated by astonished Arsenal fans.

The former Auxerre striker finally burst on to the Gunners scene in the 5-1 win against Benfica after a questionable first year, netting four goals.

Joel Campbell also scored as Arsenal impressed in the Emirates Cup, giving Wenger something to think about ahead of the new season.

Unlikely hero: Yaya Sanogo was a man possessed on Saturday, scoring four goals against Benfica for Arsenal

Praise: Arsene Wenger admitted he was surprised, but said the youngster has a bright future at the club

In the mood: Sanogo celebrated his goals with a unique dance in front of the Emirates Stadium crowd

Alexis Sanchez was signed to vastly improve Arsenal's striking options as they aim for a title challenge, but Wenger admits the often erratic Sanogo has the potential to make it in North London.

Sanogo was injured for basically two years before he came to us. If you look at his goal scoring record before he got injured, it is quite frightening,' Wenger told reporters.

'You could see when he scored the first goal today, suddenly they can raining. I especially liked the third goal he scored, it was really the goal of a striker of quality. 

'He has a big future here, or course, he is 21. He has something of Adebayor. He is strong, a strong body, similar strengths (to Adebayor), but as well technical skill.'

Core players: Wenger says he can slowly improve the England team with players like Calum Chambers

Point to prove: Jack Wilshere also featured on Saturday, another young Three Lions player

Calum Chambers was another player looking to make a point, and he excelled at centre-back, a position Wenger may look to utilise him in.

The youngster is England's Under 19 captain, and with the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere also at the club, the French boss says he can help the Three Lions excel in the future.

'He is 19 years old, and what he did is very promising. 

'I told you we will have a core of English players, you have to trust me, I will get you slowly a good national team.'

Impact: Wenger has a word with new signing Alexis Sanchez ahead of the Chilean's debut for the Gunners

Another swoop? Wenger hinted that he had enquired for Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira

Fans were in a buoyant mood after the pre-season victory, helped by early deals in the transfer market. But Wenger has already insisted he won't stop there.

Sami Khedira has been heavily linked with a switch in recent weeks, and while the 64-year-old denied Arsenal had made a bid for the Real Madrid midfielder, he did hint that some contact had been made.

Asked if he had enquried, Wenger replied: 'What is an enquiry for you? I don't know [if he's available]. If I read the newspapers, he is.'
