They were armed with just two shovels and a digger, and vowed to build the longest waterslide in the world by the end of this month.

And as these pictures show, New Zealanders Jimi Hunt and Dan Drupstee have dug their way to victory.

The pair of New Zealanders have constructed the  650m attraction in Auckland, will only stay open for two days, as part of a festival to help combat depression and promote the pair's motto: 'Living more awesome'.

And already people are enjoying the muddy thrills and spills on a waterslide dug into a hillside in Waimauku.

But only 2,000 people will have the honour of riding the water slide.

In a video posted online, Mr Hunt walks through a 'luge-track' style trench cut in the hillside, which includes a 'tunnel' where the slide runs under a fence.

Despite being a mud track through fields of cows at the moment, Dan Drupsteen (left) and Jimi Hunt's (right) waterslide is expected to clinch the title of world's longest when it is complete

Co-founder Dan Drupsteen said: 'We're a couple of Kiwi guys who like so many others have really suffered at hands of depression.

'It
was really tough, but having come out the other side we decided the 
best way for us to keep depression at bay was to 'Live More Awesome'.

'We hope this amazing project will encourage others to do the same and we want people to know it's okay to ask for help.

'It's much easier to make a difference or be awesome when you have friends by your side.'

Mr Hunt can be seen on a YouTube 
video clip about the making of the project explaining just how long it is.

Three slides are being built down the
hillside - the 650metre-long monster, along with two smaller ones - one
80metres and another 60metre 'grandma slip'n'slide' for the more timid.

Currently
the world's longest waterslide is the Black Hole in Austria's 
Sonnentherme Lutzmannsburg. It measures 211m in length and features 
lights, sounds and fog effects. About halfway through there is a 6m 
section where the slider goes almost into freefall.

Hunt's previous adventures include riding a lilo down the Waikato River in New Zealand.

The 650metre-long waterslide, the brainchild of New Zealanders Jimi Hunt and Dan Drupsteen (pictured), will be open for public to use on February 23 and 24 near Auckland

The opening of the slide will form part of a festival to help combat depression and promote the pair's motto 'living more awesome'

The
men say 'Live More Awesome' was based around the idea that if they 
continued to strive for better things and 'live more awesome' then there
was no way that depression would ever get them again.

Through
their online and social media presence, then men hope to connect those 
people to others with like minds and encourage people to have hobbies, 
do things rather than buying things and have fun.
