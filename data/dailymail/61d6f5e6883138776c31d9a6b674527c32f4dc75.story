Saad Al-Hilli, one of the four people killed in the Alps murder two years ago today

Those responsible for the murders of four people including members of a British family in the Alps may got away with ‘the perfect crime’, investigators conceded today. 

Their chilling words come on the second anniversary of a bloodbath which has baffled detectives.

It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother and a French cyclist.

The Al-Hillis' daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

‘The further we advance, the less conviction we have,’ conceded local prosecutor Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry.

‘It lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up. On a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track.’

Mr Maillaud said that ‘after two years’ hundreds of people had been interviewed, thousands of documents read, and numerous forensic tests carried out ‘but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out.’

Conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud told France’s Metronews: ‘We have tried everything possible, but we’re perhaps we’re in the presence of the perfect crime.’

Detectives thought they had made a breakthrough in June when a 35-year-old Iraqi convicted criminal was questioned for three days, but he provided an alibi.

In another bizarre twist, it has emerged that Mrs Al-Hilli had a ‘secret ex-husband’ who died in mysterious circumstances in America on exactly the same day as the quadruple killing.

The Al-Hillis, from Claygate, Surrey, originally came from Iraq, and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein may be a reason for their murders.

Lt Col Benoit Vinnemann, one of the police commanders working on the case, has meanwhile raised the prospect of a ‘family secret’ which may have provided a motive for the murder.

He said Iqbal Al-Hilli was ‘secretly married’ to an American dentist 13 years her senior, identified only at James T, between February 1999 and December 2000.

The short relationship was ‘never spoken about’ and James T died in Natchez, Mississippi - on exactly the same day as the Alps killings - with one theory being that a poison dart was used to assassinate him, though the official cause of death was a heart attack. 

Mrs Al-Hilli died next to her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, while local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car.

There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey.

Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, the brother of murdered Saad, was arrested last year but released because of lack of evidence

Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested last year under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence.

Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old old former policeman from the Annecy area, also spent four days in custody over the killings in February.

The gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders.

Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well.

This has led to well-sourced theories that Mr Mollier, the cyclist, may have been the principal target.

He had recently left his wife and two children to live with a multi-millionaire heiress, with whom he had just had a baby, and there were said to be tensions in the relationship.

There have been accusations that the French authorities are involved in a cover-up, as they insist that Mr Mollier was just an unlucky passer-by who got caught in the crossfire.

Zainab and Zeena, the surviving daughters, are now in the care of members of the Al-Hillis' extended family.

They have been given round-the-clock security because those responsible for the murders are still at large.

Zainab is certain to have seen those responsible, although she is not thought to have provided any kind of detailed description.

The killings took place in an isolated lay-by on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of Chevaline.

A detective involved in the case said: 'The reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence, and disappeared without trace. It is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved.'
