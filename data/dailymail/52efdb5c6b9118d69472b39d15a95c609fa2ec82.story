Arjen Robben was the star of the show and here is his heat map

Three days in to this World Cup and already the champions have a weaker grip on their trophy. Spain lost the first game four years ago, too, but defeat by Switzerland in South Africa cannot compare psychologically to these stunning events in north-east Brazil.

Spain’s worst defeat since a 1963 reverse to Scotland, this was more than a setback. This was a humiliating, humbling capitulation, a defeat that asks as much about the mental fortitude of Vicente del Bosque’s team as it does their hapless defending.

Some defeats in sport represent more than the loss of a solitary contest and this was one of them. This was a 7&6 in Ryder Cup singles, an Ashes defeat by an innings, a round one knockout in Vegas. Some teams would not recover from this. It remains to be seen if Spain can.

Holland were brilliant. So hungry as to be ravenous and driven relentlessly forwards by the mesmeric talents of Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

The upshot was one of the World Cup’s most startling results. We all remember Argentina’s loss to Cameroon in 1990, France succumbing to Senegal in Seoul 12 years later. In the very same way, we will remember this.

Taken in isolation, the result was staggering enough. Spain 1 Holland 5. Say it slowly to make sure it’s real.

What made this even more remarkable, though, was the way that it happened. Moments before half-time, Spain were a goal ahead and cruising. Had David Silva scored when played clear at this time the champions probably would have won.

Fast forward an hour, though, and Spain were on their knees. In their eyes they had the shocked look of street mugging victims. Holland scored five and could have scored eight. Iker Casillas – who had a dreadful night – produced a stunning double save late on, while Wesley Sneijder fell over when it looked easier to score.

'In the end, it could have been six, seven or eight,' said Van Persie. 'But, really, it couldn’t be better.'

Ultimately, the only thing that saved Spain was the full-time whistle. Back in the quiet of the dressing room, they will have looked at each other and seen faces they did not recognise staring back.

The highlights reel will, of course, show them scoring first. Once again there was controversy about it but few will care now.

Forward Diego Costa turned in the penalty area, placed his foot on a defender’s leg and was given a penalty. It was a poor decision but Xabi Alonso struck the kick to the right and Spain had a deserved lead.

For a while, all was normal. Costa was struggling but it didn’t seem to matter. Xavi and Silva enjoyed a good 15 minutes and Spain looked likely to score again.

Had they done so, Holland couldn’t have complained and Silva’s miss – trying to chip the goalkeeper – was certainly pivotal as within a minute or two the Dutch were level.

Dutch left back Daley Blind’s pass from deep across field to Van Persie was certainly a good one. Spain failed to move out as one and the Manchester United forward was onside. Briefly he looked as though he may control the ball but ultimately he threw himself forwards and the header that arched above and beyond Casillas was as good as you will see.

On terms at half-time, Holland would have taken a draw.  As it transpired they emerged to humiliate Spain. The Dutch simply can’t have had a better 45 minutes of football.

The second goal, in the 53rd minute, started with Blind once again. This time his target was Robben and the manner in which the Bayern Munich star controlled the ball to turn back inside Gerard Pique and score was wonderful.

It was Spain’s heaviest defeat since Scotland beat them 6-2 in 1963.

Portugal beat them 4-0 in 2010.

Spain last conceded three in Brazil in the Confederations Cup final last June (lost 3-0 to Brazil (Fred 2, Neymar).

They last conceded two to Group B rivals Chile in a friendly in September.

They lost WC opener to Switzerland in 2010 (0-1, Gelson Fernandes).

The Dutch have scored as many goals against the World Champions as they did in both their qualifying games against Andorra combined (5)

As the rain fell hard, Spain sought answers. Del Bosque appeared briefly to urge them to lift their heads but they couldn’t. He made substitutions but they didn’t work. The direction of the game was set, the die cast.

Goal three was a tough one. Casillas’ attempt to gather a corner was impeded by Van Persie but he simply needed to be stronger and as the ball disappeared over his head, Stefan de Vrij bundled it in on the goal line.

Here on Friday night, Casillas looked like a goalkeeper in need. He looks not to have recovered from his poor showing in last month’s Champions League final and it will be interesting to see if Del Bosque drops him next week and, if so, who out of David de Gea or Pepe Reina comes in.

'I won’t blame individuals,' said Del Bosque. 'But we must improve. We cannot go under.'

Certainly what happened in the 72nd minute wouldn’t have helped Casillas’ cause. Trying to control a simple back pass, the goalkeeper only managed to present the ball to Van Persie and goal No 4 was poked in to the empty goal as Holland took events from the surprising to the simply unforgettable.

Still there was time for a fifth. More mistakes from Spain, a gallop forward by Robben past Sergio Ramos and another devastating finish.

On the Dutch bench, coach Louis van Gaal smiled and tried to look phlegmatic.

'We can get better, without a shadow of a doubt,' he said later.

Del Bosque, meanwhile, placed a towel across his knee as the rain fell. He may well have placed it over his head.
