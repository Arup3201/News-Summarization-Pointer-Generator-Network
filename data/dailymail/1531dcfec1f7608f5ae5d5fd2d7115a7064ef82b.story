A prisoner gouged out his eyes in protest at the sweltering conditions inside his cell, it was claimed today.

The unnamed man is said to have inflicted the horrifying injuries on himself at HMP Nottingham on Monday evening as temperatures reached about 25C.

It is thought he was protesting at the temperature in his cell. However, the Ministry of Justice have today denied this was the case.

An ambulance then took the man, believed
 to be just days from his release date, to the Queen’s Medical Centre 
hospital in Nottingham.

A prisoner at HMP Nottingham, pictured, is said to have gouged out his own eyes in protest at sweltering conditions. It is thought the unnamed man inflicted the injuries as temperatures reached 25C on Monday

This morning, the hospital would not confirm the inmate's condition.

Prison bosses say they have now launched an investigation.

A number of inmates were thought to be protesting at conditions across the jail when the shocking incident took place.

A source inside the jail said: 'Somebody cut their eyes out of their face. He was protesting. The
 heat is just so high. Prisoners simply can’t deal with it.

'They need to
 let some air in the room. It’s only going to get worse.'

Prisoners who were released from the jail today described what they had heard.

Graham Doughty, who was held on the same wing as the man, said: 'I was told he got a blade out of a razor and was gouging his eyes out.

'There was blood all over the place. We heard the screams about 7.30pm, but nobody came until 8pm. When they came, they came en masse, and he was pulling his other eye out as well.'

East Midlands Ambulance Service 
confirmed it was called to the scene at 6.43pm to treat a male 
patient and that a prison nurse was already helping the man.

Police
 also confirmed they were called to the jail at 8pm the same evening to a
 report of an injured man and, following inquiries, 'it was established that no crime had taken place'.

A statement from the Ministry of Justice said: 'A prisoner at HMP Nottingham was taken to hospital following an act of self-harm.

'Staff reacted quickly and paramedics attended. No other prisoners were involved.

'The prison is investigating the incident and police were informed as a matter of course.'

Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the 
Howard League for Penal Reform, was critical of conditions in prisons today.

She said: 'Prison windows allow virtually no
 ventilation so temperatures in tiny cells holding two or three men soar
 to unbearable levels and the stench from the open toilet is 
overwhelming.

'Men are caged in these cells for up to 23 hours a day.

'We have reverted to prison conditions of the eighteenth century.'

The incident comes after a critical report of the Category B prison was released by the Independent Monitoring Board.

The organisation’s annual review said a 25 per cent cut in budget had led to the loss of 140 officers despite the capacity of the prison being upped in the same period.

The IMB said the changes in operations were 'unsustainable' and would lead to 'more prisoner disruption and a further reduction in already low staff morale' in the future.

It said prisoners were being stopped from having showers, work and education programmes were being cancelled, prisoners with serious mental health problems were being kept in cells formerly used for solitary confinement and Muslim inmates’ food had been contaminated with pork products.

Speaking earlier this week, a Prison Service spokesman said: 'Staffing levels at HMP Nottingham are at an appropriate level to ensure the prison runs safely.

'Our approach to staffing levels has been agreed with the unions and puts prison officers back in frontline roles where they are most needed.'

But a woman visiting the prison said the conditions were 'dreadful.'

She added: 'It is disgusting. They hardly leave their cells, being in there at least 23 hours a day if not 24.

'They can have as little as one shower a week and exercise twice a week, which they are meant to have every day. That place is just horrible.'
