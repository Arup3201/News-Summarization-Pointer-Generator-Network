The prominent Aspen family of slain socialite Nancy Pfister - whose body was mysteriously found in the closet of her home last month - are now under watch by the sheriff's department amid concerns other suspects in the murder case have not been apprehended.

While three people have already been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree in connection to the case, authorities say the investigation is not over and are not taking any precautions when it comes to the victims relatives.

The first homicide investigation in Aspen in over a decade, Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, who developed the Buttermilk Mountain Ski Area.

While both parents are dead, Page Six have reported that her sisters, Suzanne and Christina, as well as her daughter Juliana, have been assigned security by the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office.

'They’re not sure if they’ve got them all,' a source told the column.

'There could be others lurking. Nancy’s relatives have been assigned security by the sheriff’s department.

'They are very grateful for that, and the support of friends and loved ones.'

Police and prosecutors have been tight-lipped about what they believe happend to Pfister, essentially releasing no information about the case, however the three accused have all separated appeared in court.

Pfister, 57, who was briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas, was found severely beaten in her mountain home on February 26, just four days after returning from an extended trip to Australia, authorities said.

Pfister's assistant and friend, Katherine Carpenter, 56, who discovered her body, is the latest to be arrested and charged with her alleged murder.

Latest suspect: Katherine Carpenter - a friend of victim Nancy Pfister, who paid her to overlook her home while Pfister traveled - has been formally charged with first-degree murder. However details about the case remain scant

The tenants: Nancy Christine Styler, 62, and husband William Francis Styler III, 65, have been charged with allegedly killing Pfister, their landlord, and shoving her in a closet

The tenants staying in Pfister's home, William F. Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Styler, 62, were the first to be formally charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't paid utilities'.

Over the years Pfister had paid Carpenter, an employee at two Apline bank branches in Aspen, to manage her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month lease.

On February 6, Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that anyone interested should contact Carpenter.

She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter.

William Styler, wearing an orange jail outfit, kept his head down as he was brought into Pitkin County District Court in a wheelchair. earlier this month.

Nancy Styler entered the courtroom in handcuffs immediately after her husband.

The Stylers are represented by separate lawyers and did not acknowledge each other.

Evidence: Posts put on Facebook by Pfister detailed the problems she was having with her home in Aspen, where she was inevitably found dead. Investigators spent weeks at the home gathering evidence

Juliana Pfister attended those proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged rent dispute.

'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said.

'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.'

Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, which remained an active crime, removing many boxes and files as evidence.

County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has released few details about the resort town's first murder investigation since 2001.

'This is a very important case,' he said.

'It just doesn't happen in Aspen.'

Police have not ruled out making more arrests the Pfister's death remains an open investigation.

The autopsy report has not been released and all records in the case have been sealed.

Bail has not been set for any of the defendants.

Old life: William Styler, a former physician, and his gardening expert wife Nancy look relaxed as they smile for a photo. The couple have been charged with murdering Nancy Pfister

Carpenter worked as a bank teller at two Alpine Bank branches - the Aspen Business Center and East Hopkins Avenue. The bank recognized her 20-year service in November.

According to public records, she kept a post office box in Woody Creek 
and had lived in various towns throughout Colorado. She also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 
1999, according to federal court records.

Two Alpine Bank customers told The Aspen Times that Carpenter was friendly.

'I would have bet the farm that she didn’t do it,' one of the customers said.

Friends of the Stylers say they have been shocked at the arrests.

'They never demonstrated any kind of edge,' Dr. Joel Cooperman, a former neighbor, told the Denver Post. 'Neither of them displayed any kind of behavior that would indicate they would do anything like this.'

'I would laugh to think that that’s what they were involved in. They can't be,' Ned Ingham, a former neighbor, told CBS. 'I am totally floored. It would the last thing I’d ever think.'

Dr
 Styler, known as Trey, was an anesthesiologist and the chairman of St. 
Joseph Hospital's Department of Anesthesiology in the 1990s.

The couple, who have a son, lived in 
the Greenwood Village area until about eight years ago, when Styler was 
hit by a chronic illness. He quit his medical practice and his license 
expired in 2005.

Afterwards, he turned his attentions to helping his wife in her full-time gardening career.

She

 founded the Victoria Conservancy and provided lilies to gardening 
entities around the world, becoming known as a leading expert on the 
variety of an 8-foot species called Victoria. They also welcomed school 
children into the garden to look at the flowers and their pond.

'They would have people from all over the world over there,' neighbor Ned Ingham said. 'They were known famously for their flowers.'

A
 photographer, Povy Kendal Atchison, spent time photographing the 
Stylers' gardens and the couple for business shots at the time 'things 
were going south for them'.

Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at his Colorado motel room

Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found

She
 told the Denver Post that they seemed like they were good people until 
their money started running out. Court documents reveal the extent of 
their troubles.

In
 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia 
Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, 
but he lost the case.

He 
accused his lawyer John Powell, whom he had paid $600,000, for 
overcharging him for legal services - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell 
for the debt, the Aspen Times reported.

He
 won and Powell was put on probation and ordered to pay $800,000. But 
before the Stylers got the money, Powell filed for bankruptcy, 
protecting him from having to pay the 
debt.

The report in the 
Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal 
thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit 
'suicide by cop'.

In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse during her first appearance earlier this month

Locked up: Styler - who had been suffering various illnesses before his arrest -and his wife are being held without bond

'It was very devastating to him,' said Paul Gordon, a Denver attorney who represented Styler.

Last summer, Powell complained to the state's Attorney 
Regulation Counsel that Styler was observing his house - and Styler responded that he was trying to find out if Powell still lived there .

As 
recently as November last year, Styler had written to the 
court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting
 money - the same time he was renting the property from 
Pfister.

When she returned from Australia and 
evicted the couple nearly two weeks ago, they had been staying at the 
Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt, where rooms cost $119 per night.

William Styler was taken 
from the motel still wearing his bathrobe, while his wife was seen with 
tears streaming down her face.

Missed: Pfister, pictured right with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills

Well-connected: Nancy Pfister was once briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas

Nancy Pfister's remains were cremated on Monday and relatives and residents are holding a memorial service for her on March 15.

Her murder has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident.

'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.'

The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas.

Pfister's
 daughter said she is waiting to find out more details on the case.

Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community.

'I
 have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to
 her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or 
hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' 
Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong 
people this time.'
