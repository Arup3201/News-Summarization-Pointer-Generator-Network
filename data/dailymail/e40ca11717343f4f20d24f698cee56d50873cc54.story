Julie Creffield is on a quest to prove that slim doesn't necessarily mean fit - and fat doesn't always equate to being unhealthy.

Weighing 15st 7lb, Julie runs 5-10km four times a week, incorporating a longer run at weekends when training for a marathon.

She's set up a website, 'The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running’, to help others to start running, whatever their size.

Julie spoke to MailOnline about her mission to prove you don’t have to be slim to be fit.

At age 23 and weighing 20st Julie, from Stratford, was unfit and living on diet of fast food, with a very active social life which saw her binge drinking several times a week.

Working on the Olympic project, Julie felt she needed to make an effort with her health.

‘A a work colleague convinced me to take part in a 3k fun run. With absolutely no training, I almost died on the way round - not only due to the unusual strain on my body, but also from pure embarrassment when a young boy shouted “Run Fatty Run” as I passed him.

‘That shocked me into taking action and regaining control over my life. The following day I signed up for the London Triathlon, which I completed just three months later in a XL wetsuit that just about fitted my size 18 body.’

Despite this, Julie admits she made little real progress over the following six years, taking part in fitness events sporadically, with her party lifestyle and unhealthy diet preventing her from making any real strides in fitness or weight loss.

It was a comment by a rude spectator ('Run, fatty, run') during a 3k fun run that sparked Julie's campaign to prove bigger women can - and should - run

Julie, who gave birth to her daughter in January last year, has now changed her diet and is working with a nutritionist to make sure she gets the proper sustenance for training. However she insists weight loss is in no way a goal.

‘I rarely drink alcohol now and my diet is much more balanced. I eat more proper foods and I’ve stopped eating ‘diet’ foods.

‘I cook much more food from scratch and snack more healthy on things like fruit and nuts.

‘Now I’m a mother I didn’t want to pass on unhealthy habits to my daughter.

Julie's blog about running as a larger lady received thousands of hits, so set up her website 'The Fat Girls' Guide to Running'

‘I also want to be a good role model for people. I don’t want to say you can eat literally whatever you want as long as you exercise and be healthy because that isn’t the case.

‘Obesity is a huge concern around the world, but inactivity is the big killer of our time. Many people simply think that running is something that fat women can’t or shouldn’t do at all, including some medical professionals - I am on a mission to prove otherwise.’

Julie set up The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger or a mother, as well as nutrition tips, events as well as running campaigns such as ‘Kit that Fits’ which encourages companies to make workout clothes available in larger sizes.

Julie says: ‘ The blog was going on in the background telling my story and I started to get people coming to me asking for advice.

‘It was getting upwards of 10,000 hits and I started to think, this is something I am really passionate about and I could do it full time.’

The website, which advocates the Health at Every Size approach or HAES, states: ‘Being overweight in this modern world is not an easy thing what with the Medias obsession with an unachievable idea of “The Perfect Body” the pressure to be a certain size and to live a healthy lifestyle has never been stronger.

Julie now runs day-long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active

‘But we all know that slim does not equal fit, and fat does not always equate to being unhealthy, or inactive, or lazy, or… all of those other negative connotations that it has acquired over the years.

‘HAES isn’t suggesting that everyone of every size is always healthy – a popular misconception. Instead, it focuses on helping anyone interested in being as healthy as they can be in the body they have right now. Hand in hand with this it challenges size stigma to advance equality.’

Julie hopes to continue to expand the website, and now runs day long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active.
