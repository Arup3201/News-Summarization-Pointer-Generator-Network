Norway has become the latest country to consider stripping citizenship from extremists who travel abroad to fight jihad.

The government said it was important to send 'a strong signal' to people thinking about leaving the country to join terror groups.

It came as London Mayor Boris Johnson called for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State (ISIS) to be automatically stripped of their passports.

In echoing that call, Norway's Minister of Children and Equality, Solveig Horne, said the government will 'turn over every stone' to prevent its citizens from becoming radicalised.

She told The Local: 'We will begin discussion about introducing regulations on revocation for any citizen causing serious damage to vital government interests or who has volunteered to serve in foreign military services.

'This is a strong signal to people wanting to take part in terror operations and wars.'

Other countries, including Denmark and the Netherlands are looking at similar measures.

Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said Britain must take on ISIS to 'try to close it down now', warning that doing nothing would mean a 'tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door'.

The mayor, who has overall responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, called for new laws that would mean anyone visiting Iraq and Syria would be automatically presumed to be terrorists unless they had notified the authorities in advance.

The issue has been pulled into sharp 
focus for many Western governments after the brutal killing of U.S. 
journalist James Foley by an Islamic State fighter dubbed 'jihadi John'.

Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said: ‘Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in "battle" they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins.

‘Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to "black-eyed virgins" is in fact a promise of 72 raisins.

'I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.'

However, he was roundly criticised for his comments.

Richard Barrett, a former MI6 security chief, said the threat from ISIS was ‘unproven’ and needed to be better understood before new laws were rushed through.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg added that new legislation to combat the threat posed by British jihadists returning from the Middle East would not remove the danger from Islamic State extremists.
