All they wanted to do was make their lawn look pretty.

Fed up with motorists parking on the verge, this couple planted a colourful flowerbed to keep them away.

For the past 15 years, they have nurtured daffodils, pansies and hydrangeas, which were admired by all their neighbours.

Colin and Kath Halsey have been told they could face criminal damage charges after planting daffodils and pansies on a grass verge outside their home

15 years after they first planted the flowers in 1999 the couple have been warned by a council official that their 'planting activity' was a criminal offence

But the local council has suddenly decided that the well-kept flowerbed is a criminal offence under the Highways Act.

And it has threatened Colin Halsey, 77, and his wife, Kath, 76, with court action unless they dig it up.

The trouble started when a council officer inspecting the area warned Mr Halsey, who has lived in the house in Northwich, Cheshire, for 53 years, about his ‘planting activity’.

The retired salesman then received a letter saying he could be charged with ‘criminally damaging the highway’ – which carries a maximum £50 fine – if he failed to remove the plants and returf the area at his own expense.

The Halseys planted these flowers and bushes on the verge outside their home to stop motorists churning up the grass whenever they parked their cars

The illicit beds were spotted when the council worker carried out an inspection of the village

Mr Halsey was told by a council worker that planting the flowers amounted to a criminal offence under section 131 of the Highways Act 1980,

‘This situation really upsets us – especially as we have nurtured that flowerbed for the best part of 15 years,’ Mr Halsey said.

‘We spent a lot of money to make the area look nice and now some council jobsworth wants us to get it back to how it was.

‘The front garden used to look terrible with cars churning up the soil.

'All we wanted to do was to stop that for the good of the neighbourhood. All our neighbours liked the flowerbed.

When Mr Halsey failed to remove the flowers he was sent a legal letter, accusing the pensioner of adding extra plants

Today the couple were warned they may face a charge of 'removing any soil or turf from any part of a highway without lawful authority'

The trouble began when a chestnut tree, which had stood in this spot, was felled and the area was subsequently visited by a council officer

The letter sent to the Halseys from a worker at Cheshire West and Chester Council warning them that the verge should be restored to its original state

‘The council say if an accident happened on the flowerbed it would not be known who was liable if someone got sued.

‘No one gave a damn for almost 15 years – now we’re being threatened with a criminal record.’

He added: ‘Surely the council have better things to do.

Mr Halsey said that his front garden had looked 'terrible' with cars churning up the soil, and he wanted to stop this 'for the good of the neighbourhood'

Mr Halsey suggested that council workers could turn their attentions to sorting out damaged verges in other parts of their street

‘There must be more important things they need to focus on, like cleaning the streets and sorting the churned-up lawns in the rest of the area.’ 

The great-grandparents have spent more than £250 on flowers and bedding plants for the verge, which they planted as part of a tidy-up project in 1999 for the millennium celebrations.

A spokesman for Cheshire West and Chester Council said: ‘We do have a responsibility to maintain grass verges and it’s very difficult to do that if there are things people have done on their own.

‘What we would like to do in this case is discuss with the residents to see if some kind of formal agreement can be put in place.’

The Halseys planted the flowers on the verge to brighten up the area, and to stop the grass outside their home from ending up like this

Mr and Mrs Halsey's own garden is just as colourful as the beds they planted outside their home
