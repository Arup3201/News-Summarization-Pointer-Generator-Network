They may be known for their glossy hair, picture-perfect make-up and bikini bodies, but judging by the packed itinerary, the Miss Universe contestants will have to prove they are both beauty and brains.

Nearly 90 of the world’s most beautiful women descended on Miami on Monday ahead the 2014 Miss Universe pageant and it looks like they've got a tough few weeks ahead.

The preliminary competition, which includes evening gown, swimsuit and the interview rounds, will take place on Wednesday 21 January - but that doesn't mean the preparations haven't begun.

Women from dozens of countries - including Albania, El Salvador, Great Britain and Haiti - have been preparing backstage for the biggest week of their lives.

The event's official photographer followed the women, who are touring, filming, rehearsing and preparing to compete, and captured the lengthy preparation processes, from getting their haired coiffed to having dresses fitted.

The events schedule kicks off on Friday with a drinks reception. Miss Universe contestants will be introduced to the public and to the City of Doral, where the event is being held, for the first time on stage at the Downtown Doral Park. Quite fittingly, there will be a pink carpet for VIP arrivals.

To show off their modelling skills, on Saturday the Miss Universe contestants will be showcasing fashion brand Chinese Laundry's spring 2015 collection while wearing the latest footwear styles from the label. Later in the day, the ladies will put their best foot forward with salsa dancing lessons.

On Sunday, they will enjoy a Graffiti Art Experience by visiting pop artist Romero Britto’s studio for an interactive painting event. Then, they will take part in the celebration of the nations with  a cultural parade and an afternoon of live music, dancing, food carts, and mingling. 

The parade will feature marching bands and a variety of luxury cars showcasing the Miss Universe contestants. Local restaurants will hold a gastronomic festival and multicultural dances will take place.

The following week kicks off with a golf putting tournament, zumba lessons and a cooking contest. Contestants will also show their charitable side when they accompany Miss Universe 2014, Gabriela Isler, on a visit to FFP, the largest international charity in the United States that serves the poor in countries in the Caribbean and Latin America.

There will also be a Yamamay swimsuit fashion show and a gifting auction. Every year, the contestants bring a gift from their country that will be donated to a silent auction to support a selected charity. This is a special annual event and this year proceeds will go to Best Buddies, a long-term partner of the Miss Universe Organization’s. 

The ladies will also get to let their hair down ahead of the preliminary competition at a VIP cocktail reception  at Image Skincare, the official skincare sponsor. There will be a DJ, red carpet and the women will carry out interviews with press.  

Following on from the preliminary round, the top 15 women will be chosen and they will go straight into the National Costume round the same night.

The finals will be held at the FIU Arena on Sunday 25 January, when Venezuelan Miss Universe 2013, Gabriela Isler, will hand over her crown.

It has also been rumoured that Filipino boxer, Manny Pacquioa, will be a judge, although he is yet to confirm his place on the panel.

Among the notable contestants is Miss Great Britain, Grace Levy, an events executive from London.

Grace, who studied psychology  in Bristol, worked as an event manager of her own annual charity event and starred on popular British dating show, Take Me Out.

Tegan, who is studying for a Bachelor of Nutritional Medicine, has hopes of raising awareness of mental health in youth. She is also part of a youth mentoring program helping schoolgirls struggling with confidence.

Miss USA, 24-year-old Nia Sanchez, is half Hispanic, and has travelled across the world on countless mission trips. 

After working as a full-time model for the past seven years, she landed a face character role at Hong Kong Disney World.

The popular contest was established in 1952 as a local 'bathing beauty' competition spearheaded by Catalina Swimwear in Long Beach, California. 

Speaking about the pageant, a spokesperson for the event said: 'These women are savvy, goal-oriented and aware. The delegates who become part of the Miss Universe Organization display those characteristics in their everyday lives, both as individuals, who compete with hope of advancing their careers, personal and humanitarian goals, and as women who seek to improve the lives of others.'

This year's event hasn't come without controversy; tensions are rife in the event's city of Doral, who pledged $2.5million from its reserves to support Trump’s beauty pageant, according to the Miami Herald.

Grace Levy, Miss Great Britain, revealeds her 'patriotic' costume on Facebook

Grace Levy, Miss Great Britain, recently revealed her national costume on her Facebook page.

Alongside the image, she wrote: 'My national costume is the epitome of Great Britain, and mostly London where I live. 

'My costume portrays a sense of how I feel about being a modern day woman in my city; passionate, strong and empowered, whilst at the same time giving me the opportunity to represent something which people immediately know as British.

'It also reflects the protection of the monarchy and how patriotic I feel towards them. 

'I spent days exploring my city to find inspiration and I discovered that London is a city which is completely dedicated to them; hence why I finally decided to base my national costume on the Royal Guards of Buckingham Palace. 

'My costume was designed by myself and handmade using the same textiles and embellishments from the same factory that make all official regalia for the royal family and their guards. 

'This has made my costume that little bit more special. The factory also happens to make the costumes for smash hit British TV series Game of Thrones. 

'I can't wait to represent the greatness of Britain on stage in Miami! To the people of GB..... This is for YOU.'

However, not everyone was taken with Miss GB's patriotic look. 

Fashion writer Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) todl FEMAIL: 'This, she says, shows how she feels about the Monarchy. Not a great deal, by the looks of it!

'It looks more like a cheap, tacky tribute to Cheryl Cole.'There is nothing here that will protect the Monarchy. 

'In fact, if I was the Queen, I'd make sure she's ousted from the country immediately.'
