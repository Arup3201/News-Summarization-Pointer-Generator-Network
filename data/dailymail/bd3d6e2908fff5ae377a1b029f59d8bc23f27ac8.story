If there's one thing the internet does well, it's videos of cats doing funny things.

Pizza Hut Japan has embraced people's obsession with cat videos and created their own video series where cats run a fictional store called Pizza Cat.

The webisodes star four felines who run Pizza Cat and show each "employee" doing various jobs like taking orders, delivering pizzas, handling money and vacuuming the floors - none of which they do particularly well.

Each video is adorable, weird and totally pointless, just like most cat videos on the internet.Â  But if you love animals you'll be hooked on this cheesy campaign.

Pizza Hut Japan has released a brand-new marketing campaign, featuring videos where cats take over a Pizza Hut store and rename it Pizza Cat

Expect a few fur balls in your pizza from Pizza Cat. The ginger cat coughs one up while the other cats do not look amused

Wearing adorable miniature Pizza Hut uniforms, the furballs with attitude run the restaurant and needless to say, they're not very good at it!

From taking phone orders, mapping out delivery routes, making pizzas and of course, taking designated sleep breaks, the cats adventures at Pizza Cat are so ridiculous you can't stop watching.

Who knows how these pawed employees got a job at Pizza Cat, when they can't even keep their uniforms on or stay awake on the job.

The message of the campaign is completely lost in the cuteness but it goes down well for anyone needing a laugh.

'We're not quite sure of the actual point of it all, but according to the translation of the YouTube page, "Pizza Cat! Store is a fictional store." Shocking, I know, but it's great anyway,' Alfred Maskeroni of AdWeek posted on their Best and Worst of Advertising, Branding and Design section.

Although getting a pizza with an extra topping of cat fur doesn't seem very appealing or appetizing, these videos are ridiculously moorish.

This kitty takes his job very seriously. It's not every day a cat gets to run a pizza restaurant

At Pizza Cat they take their jobs very seriously... just as long as it doesn't get in the way of chasing balls of wool
