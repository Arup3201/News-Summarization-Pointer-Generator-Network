Rank upon rank of neatly regimented towels stretching across the sands can only mean one thing.

The Germans have invaded Britain - or the British coast at any rate.

Figures from VisitBritain show that more than half a million Germans are enjoying a spot of our glorious British weather in seaside towns including Brighton, Penzance and Torquay.

Sonne, Schwimmen, Sport! German tourists are flocking to seaside destinations such as Fistral Surfing Beach in Cornwall to get a touch of the bracing British sea air

This means more Germans are choosing to holiday along the UK's 7,723-mile coastline than visitors from any other nation.

Latest figures put our Teutonic neighbours in only second place to the French in terms of visits to the UK, with 2,989 Germans coming to Britain between April 2011 and March 2012 compared with 3,820 people from France.

But yesterday's figures show those Germans who do come here are making a beeline for the beach, with 523,000 - 18 per cent of those coming to Britain - choosing coastal destinations last year.

By contrast, only 4,000 (13 per cent) of French visitors and just 355,000 (12 per cent) of Americans chose the UK as seaside destination.

Only three per cent of tourists from sunnier climes such as Brazil picked the British seaside.

Old and new: Sports and Britain's mix of history and modern culture were picked by foreign visitors as the main reasons for coming to the UK

Les rosbifs: British culinary classics such as the traditional Sunday roast were not so popular amongst holiday makers from outside the UK

The findings come from a report into what the tourist authority can do to boost visits to Britain's coastline.

A peculiarly Germanic drive to colonise our sun loungers may not be the only reason they are drawn to the coast.

'Aga sagas': The romantic Cornwall-based novels of Rosamunde Pilcher such as The Shell Seekers and Cliffs Of Love were the basis of a German TV series

VisitBritain listed Cornwall, along with East Sussex, as the most popular destination for German tourists - Cornwall being the location of writer Rosamunde Pilcher's novels, which formed the basis of an 89-part TV series in Germany.

The show gained a popularity akin to that of Downton Abbey, with as many as seven million viewers tuning into them on Sunday nights.

It's perhaps not surprising, then, that 
Cornwall and Devon alone saw a 14 per cent increase in visits from 
German tourists last year - many taking part in Pilcher-themed tours 
around the South West of England.

This was despite the fact that the total number of Germans visiting the UK rose by just two per cent - while visitors from other countries such as the U.S., Australia and Canada fell.

And Germans remained stubbornly budget-driven while on holiday over here, their percentage spend rising by just one per cent between last year and 2011 - compared with a 34 per cent spending increase from French visitors.

A spokesman from VisitBritain said: 'Over the past six years the coastal counties of East Sussex and Cornwall have attracted more than 80,000 German holidaymakers a year, significantly more than those countries attract from all other major markets.

'This tends to indicate that the possibility for coastal walks exerts a strong influence on where Germans choose to holiday in Britain.'

Reserviert: The stereotype of the German tourist laying their towel out to 'book' a beach spot could be becoming a common Cornish sight

More than 35million visitors a year (12 per cent) took to the UK's coastline, the spokesman said.

However, the 'beautiful coastline' came last in a list of reasons for visiting - along with British food - according to questionnaire-based research.

The top reason given for visiting was our 'rich sporting offer', followed by music festivals, heritage, the mixture of 'old and new' and the British countryside.
