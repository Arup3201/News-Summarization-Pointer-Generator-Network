Hate preacher Abu Qatada has lodged an appeal against his deportation to Jordan in Europe's highest appeal court - in a move which could keep him in Britain for months.

Home Secretary Theresa May ordered his 
arrest yesterday after she secured a landmark deal which she hopes will see him 
sent to Jordan to face terror charges.

But his lawyers lodged a last ditch appeal in the European Court of Human Rights last night in an attempt to halt his deportation.

A spokeswoman for the court said the 
deadline for the appeal was midnight - and it was made after 11pm last 
night. She said: 'It was literally last minute.'

As the situation descended into deeper farce, it emerged that the Home Secretary spent last night as a guest of celebrity agent Jonathan Shalit was was celebrating his 50th birthday.

Qatada's legal team claims that 
judges at the European Court of Human Rights were wrong three months ago
 when they ruled that he would not be at risk of torture if returned to 
Jordan, a court spokeswoman said.

The court's Grand Chamber will decide
 whether to hear his appeal, but the radical cleric, once described by a
 judge as Osama bin Laden's right hand man in Europe, cannot be deported
 until the court has reached a decision.

A panel of five will now meet to decide if the case can go before a Grand Chamber of 17 judges.

The spokeswoman could not give any indication the whole process would take.

The move comes as the 47 member nations of the Council of Europe prepare to meet in Brighton tomorrow for talks aimed at reforming the court and the types of cases it hears.

Home Secretary: Theresa May spebnt yesterday evening at celebrity agent Jonathan Shalit's 50th birthday

Mrs May admitted yesterday it could be ‘many months’ before the fanatic is put on a plane to his home country.

Abu
 Qatada was given three months to appeal the European Court of Human 
Rights' decision when they handed down their judgment on January 17.

His
 appeal was received just after 11pm last night - April 17. However, the
 Home Office claim that the deadline expired at midnight on April 16.

A
 Home Office spokesman said: 'Qatada has no right to refer the case to 
the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, since the 
three-month deadline to do so lapsed at midnight on Monday night.

'His case should be heard in British 
courts, as the Home Secretary outlined to Parliament yesterday. In the 
meantime, he remains in custody.'

Yesterday within hours of his detention, 
Qatada’s lawyers were demanding he be let out again on bail and making 
it clear that they would do everything possible to thwart deportation.

That could mean a string of further 
appeal hearings, adding to the £1.5million bill in legal costs and 
benefits already run up by Qatada, who has links to convicted Al Qaeda 
terrorists.

Mrs May was forced to seek the deal 
with Jordan following January’s ruling by the European Court of Human 
Rights that he would not face a fair trial if sent home. The ruling also
 led to Qatada’s release on bail in February.

Since then he has been at his family 
home in Wembley, north-west London, under strict bail conditions. The 
£1,900-a-month rent on the house is paid through benefits, and a 
surveillance operation to monitor his every move cost British taxpayers 
£100,000 a week. Just after midday yesterday, smirking Qatada was led 
from his home by immigration officers and taken to a hearing of the 
Special Immigration Appeals Commission, in Central London, which rules 
on terror immigration cases.

The hearing was delayed when Qatada demanded a translator, although he has lived here since 1993.

The judge, Mr Justice Mitting, said he
 still posed a risk of absconding and denied bail. He indicated a full 
hearing could be delayed until October. It is likely a further 
application for bail will take place within days, but last night Qatada,
 whose real name is Omar Othman, was in Belmarsh high security prison.

Next year will mark two decades since 
he first cheated his way into Britain on a fake passport, and nearly a 
decade since efforts began to remove him.

Yesterday’s hearing was told that the 
Jordanian government had agreed to ‘bend over backwards’ to ensure 
Qatada received a fair trial.

Five smartly dressed officers were in the house for around 15 minutes before emerging with Qatada, who left the house and was not handcuffed

The European Court of Human Rights found that sending Qatada, 51, back without assurances that torture evidence won't be used would be a 'flagrant denial of justice'

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for Mrs May to explain the steps she was taking to deport the cleric

The deal means that if returned 
Qatada’s earlier conviction in Jordan, handed down in his absence, will 
be quashed. His new trial on terror charges will be heard in public with
 civilian judges, he will have full access to lawyers and will be able 
to summon defence witnesses.

Following the Strasbourg ruling, which
 said torture evidence might be used against Qatada at trial, Mrs May 
and other ministers embarked on a frenetic diplomatic effort to secure 
the deal that would make deportation possible.

Mrs May insisted it would be 
impossible simply to put Qatada on a plane at once as his lawyers would 
obtain a court order preventing deportation.

Robin Simcox, counter-terrorism expert
 from the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘Theresa May deserves praise for 
her persistence and determination to expel Abu Qatada from the UK. He is
 a senior jihadist ideologue and his presence is clearly not welcome in 
this country. Furthermore, the UK Government must, as a basic principle,
 be allowed the legal freedom to deport national security threats.’

Ministers insisted last night that Britain is on track to get a deal this week to curb Strasbourg’s human rights judges.

Despite suggestions that key proposals
 had been watered down or ditched, sources said Justice Secretary 
Kenneth Clarke expected to secure wins on measures to protect the 
importance of decisions made by national courts, to make the court more 
efficient and consider fewer cases, and on the nomination process for 
judges.
