The Queen is well known for her love of all things equine.

So, there should be little doubt that when she made her historic trip to Ireland in 2011, one of the highlights would have been meeting the country's top trainers, jockeys and racehorses at the Irish National Stud in Kildare.

It only seems fair then that, as Irish President Michael D. Higgins - himself an avid racing fan - does the rounds on his state tour, she returns the favour.

It was in this spirit that Mr Higgins was invited to admire the Queen's finest animals at the Kingsclere Park House Stables in Berkshire.

The Irish Premier and his wife, Sabina Higgins, were given the tour by trainer Andrew Balding - brother of TV presenter Clare - whose family are the current custodians of the prestigious stables.

Mr Higgins had the chance to get up close with two of the Queen's prize fillies, Micras and Enliven - who is running at Newbury tomorrow.

He was then show the stable's facilities, including the exercise pools. It is not only the Queen who keeps her horses at Kingsclere, they also look after animals from other notable owners - including former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

However, not all of the trip has been so lighthearted.

There was a political fallout when Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness attended a state banquet on Tuesday, especially after former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit commented: 'There's always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.'

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said it was unacceptable for a member of the House of the Lords to support the shooting of a political leader.

'I fully understand that Norman Tebbit has himself been a victim of the political conflict and I regret that he has suffered grievously,' said Mr Adams, a former West Belfast MP and now TD for Louth in the Irish parliament.

'However, to publicly advocate the assassination of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness is a shocking throwback to a violent past from which we are seeking to move on.'

Mr Adams said his party colleague and ex-IRA commander Mr McGuinness has worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the peace process at considerable risk to himself.

Lord Tebbit was injured with his wife during the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton.

Mr McGuinness met the Queen again this afternoon, at a reception held at Windsor Castle.

It is extremely rare for the Queen to host a second reception - in addition to the banquet - during a state visit. This is being seen as a sign of the importance the Queen attributes to President Higgins's trip, following her own state visit to Ireland, with the Duke of Edinburgh, in 2011.
