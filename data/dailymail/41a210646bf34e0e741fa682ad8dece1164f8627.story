A retail chain has been slammed by shoppers for allegedly 'promoting bullying' after splashing the slogan 'You can't sit with us' across a range of products aimed at young people.

A children's charity has also condemned the quote, which they say is classed as 'covert bullying'.

Australian fashion chain Cotton On has removed t-shirts and accessories, branded with the line from the 2004 film Mean Girls, from its shops after shoppers expressed their outrage.

Jess Bridson, from Gisborne, a city in northeastern New Zealand, first spotted a black clutch bag in her local store featuring the offensive quote.

Writing on Facebook on Saturday, she said: 'Way to promote bullying Cotton On! This is really s***, why can't it say "would you like to hang with us?".'

The image was quickly shared online by people who were outraged that the bag was being sold in a shop aimed at the teen market.

Sandie Farr wrote: 'Promoting bullying to the demographic that suffers most from it - massive fail Cotton On.'

'Not cool at all Cotton On - bullying is NEVER fashionable,' Tina Ngata said.

Ema Vincent Logan added: 'Way to promote bullying guys...

'I don't really care what movie it came from it's disgusting and I had heard it far too many times as a kid and growing up.'

Liz Tibbutt also said it was irrelevant whether the line 'You can't sit with us' came from a film.

'Really, Cotton On? I know it's a quote from Mean Girls and I know it is meant to be cute but don't we have enough trouble with bullying?'

In the film, starring Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried, one of the Mean Girls, Gretchen, shouts 'you can't sit with us' at Regina because she is wearing sweatpants on a Monday - it's against the rules to wear them on that day of the week.

Regina replies: 'These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.'

Not the only one: Other popular fashion retailers also stock products with the Mean Girls slogan on them. This vest top is on sale at online retailer Misguided

'A statement like "you can't sit with us" is a form of exclusion which we categories as covert bullying,' a representative for children's charity The Alannah and Madeline Foundation, Katina Astles, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Being left out can affect all aspects of young people's lives... including their academic performance.'

She explained that bullying is a serious issue in Australia.

'Our research shows 1 in 4 kids in Australian schools experience bullying every fortnight. It can happen on the way to school, during class activities and in the playground.'

'I think it's really good Cotton On have listened to the feedback from the community and recognised the impact the products could have and taken action,' Ms Astles added. 

Cotton On Group spokeswoman Greer McCracken told the New Zealand Herald that the products have been 'voluntarily with drawn from sale, pending a formal investigation'.

She added: 'This is a business underpinned by a sound moral and ethical code. The Cotton On Group does not condone bullying on any level and takes matters such as this very seriously.'

Cotton On are not the only company who have used the the 'mean' line on its products.

Online fashion retailer Misguided, which operates in Australia, the UK and the US, is currently stocking a black and white 'You can't sit with us' vest.

Popular: Lots of online retailers sell the slogan on tops in the US. This one can be purchased from Me and My Tee for $21.93 AU

Baby version: A Mean Girls 'you can't sit with us' pink high chair organic baby bodysuit is available to buy from US online shop Spunky Stork

The top can be bought for $19.98 AU and the product description reads: 'Make a mean girl statement in our "You can't sit with us" boyfriend vest. In white with a monochrome ribbed trim, this slouchy style looks amazing with sports luxe leggings and black heeled sandals.'  

Plenty more online retailers have also borrowed the quote to be used on tops, hats and sweaters around the world.

In the US, Fairtrade retailer Spunky Stork, sells white baby bodysuits with the slogan written in pink and accompanied by a picture of a high-chair.

The Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cotton On and Misguided for comment.
