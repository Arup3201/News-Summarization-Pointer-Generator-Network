This is the cheeky seal who pops into London city centre every day for a free salmon lunch at Billingsgate Market.

For around 10 years the large marine mammal has been fed by the finest fish usually destined for some of the capital's top restaurants.

Despite being in the heart of London just yards from Canary Wharf the grey seal has resisted any attempts to release it into the wild.

Dinner time: Sammy the seal visits Billingsgate Market, Canary Wharf, where he is fed salmon by dockside porters who bang on metal to signify feeding time

Attempts have been made to release Sammy into the wild but the seal keeps returning to be fed at the dock

Instead the seal - dubbed Sammy - seems to prefer the des-res address surrounded by marinas and the city's high-flying financial market in Docklands.

Dockside porters at Billingsgate have become so used to Sammy they even 'call him' for dinner by banging at metal bar at the side of the dock.

Billingsgate constable Gary Meeks 
said: ‘They've tried to release Sammy into the wild in the past but he 
just comes back, he's obviously happy here or he wouldn't.

‘Sammy
usually turns up in the morning and the porters bang on the metal bar 
at the side of the dock and up he pops out of the water.

‘He's
obviously well fed and he must have been coming here for the last 10 
years, I'm a Londoner and you don't see many seals about to be honest.

‘His favourite fish is salmon, I'm not surprised given the size of some of the ones thrown over the fence to him.’

Sammy's favourite food is salmon and seal experts have said it would be cruel to stop feeding him now

Experts have said the markings on the seal's coat suggest Sammy could be a female

But seal experts have cast doubt on Sammy's credentials - and now believe his markings show he might actually be female.

Amy Hudson, from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, said Sammy may be a Samantha rather than a Samuel due to the markings on the seal's coat.

She said: ‘We normally advise people not to feed seals in the wild but as Sammy...has been there so long it would be cruel to stop.’

Sammy has been spotted by workers from the area and market shoppers over the years and one wildlife enthusiast even uploaded footage of the seal online.

He is such a regular face around the docks at Billingsgate the he has been included in Zoological Society London's Marine 
Mammal Survey since 2008.

ZSL’s Marine and Freshwater Conservation Programme Manager, Alison 
Debney, said: 'Sightings such as Sammy are very important; they help to 
build up a picture of the rivers’ role in the ecology of British marine 
mammals.

'We need people to keep an eye out and to detail their sightings
at www.zsl.org – it could help conservationists in the future.'

Sammy was first named by Samantha Davenport, who spotted him when working at Canary Wharf's Barclays Bank building.

She named Sammy after after a children’s book by Syd Hoff. She told ZSL: 'It was so 
exciting the first time I saw the seal, I almost jumped in – it’s a 
lovely and quite grounding experience to see such wildlife amongst all 
this steel and glass.'

Billingsgate became associated 
exclusively with the fish trade in the sixteenth century and in 1699 an 
Act of Parliament was passed making Billingsgate ‘a free and open market
for all sorts of fish whatsoever’.

Between 1920 and 1964, the Thames was devoid of fish. Flounder and 
European eel were the first two species to re-colonise the river.

Since the mid 1960s the number of species in the Thames has increased 
to 124.
