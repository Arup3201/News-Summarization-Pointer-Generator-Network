Taxi app Uber offered a woman £20 credit after she was allegedly sexually harassed by a driver who asked to perform a sex act on her, it was claimed last night.

The passenger said she had initially got in the back of the cab in London before the driver asked if she wanted to sit in the front - which she did, because she was feeling car sick.

But the driver then asked about her relationship status before inquiring if she enjoyed sex acts being performed on her - suggesting he could pull over into a side road to carry out one.

Claims: Taxi hailing company Uber (file picture) has offered a woman £20 credit who alleged she had been sexually harassed by a driver who asked to perform a sex act on her

The woman complained to Uber, who apologised for the ‘intrusive experience’ and said the incident was already being investigated. However, she was unimpressed by this response and wrote back.

In another email to Uber - the firm behind an app letting customers book and track vehicles - she said the incident in March left her feeling uncomfortable, according to Newsweek’s Lucy Draper.

The woman said in the message: ‘I am pretty relaxed and outgoing and I feel that I can take care of myself, and if I felt so uncomfortable I dread to think how a more timid girl would have felt.

‘I won't be taking this any further but I do implore you to take this quite seriously as I worry for other women who could find themselves in a similar situation.’

Another Uber employee then responded to say her trip had been refunded and £20 was credited to her account. This response was signed off with: ‘Sorry again for such an un-Uber experience.’

The woman - who has heard nothing more from the firm - said she was told by Uber that it was refunding the money 'in hope that you will give us a second chance', reported Newsweek.

But an Uber spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘Uber does not give credit as compensation for issues of a serious nature.

‘In this incident, which dates back to the beginning of this year, Uber added £20 to the rider’s account when the original trip was refunded.

‘We take all allegations incredibly seriously - any driver who is accused of acting inappropriately is suspended from the platform while an investigation is undertaken.

‘The driver involved in this incident was permanently deactivated from the Uber platform.’

Founded in 2009 in California, Uber is best known for its smartphone app that connects passengers with local drivers, and the company then charges a commission for each ride.

When a journey is complete, customers are invited to 'rate' the driver on a five-star system, and the driver can do the same with the customer.

The company said last week it was valued at £25.5billion, a double in market value in six months. Uber is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries.

Protests: Separately today, Uber said it would review its India operations and improve driver screening as it tried to reach an agreement with politicians to restart services, after being banned in New Delhi

Uber has been banned from operating in Spain while a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association is probed

But today, Uber said it would review its India operations and improve driver screening as it tried to reach an agreement with politicians to restart services, after being banned in New Delhi.

The federal government asked states to ban Uber amid concerns about passenger safety after one of the company's drivers was arrested for allegedly raping a young female passenger in New Delhi.

The case caused uproar in India after it was revealed the suspect had been previously charged with sexual offences including rape. Uber failed to uncover the charges because it does not carry out background checks on drivers in India.

And on Tuesday, MailOnline reported how a judge had banned Uber from operating in Spain while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association.

The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the capital's court services said in a statement.

They also accused drivers hired through the app of 'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job’. But a company spokesman hit back, saying: ‘Uber is confident that when once we have had the opportunity to present our case in court, these precautionary measures will be lifted.’
