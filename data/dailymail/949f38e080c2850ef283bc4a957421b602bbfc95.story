Public trust in the police has been severely shaken by recent corruption scandals, a major report warned yesterday.

In a worrying assessment, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor said the public felt badly let down by the failure of officers to live up to expected standards of integrity.

The Stephen Lawrence investigation, Hillsborough, Plebgate, revelations about undercover officers, the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 riots and other recent controversies have, he said, left the police damaged – despite ordinary bobbies being more honest than they were in the 1960s and 1970s.

In his 163-page assessment of the State of Policing in England and Wales, Mr Winsor concludes forces are:

But it is his conclusions around public trust in the police which will raise the most concern.

He wrote: ‘Controversies and revelations of a serious and negative nature in relation to the conduct of some police officers, both past and present, have hurt public confidence in the police, and the morale of the very great majority of honest, hardworking, committed and brave police officers has suffered as a consequence.’

He added: ‘The police service has been damaged, but it is certainly not broken.’ Mr Winsor called on police leaders to ‘repair the damage which has been done’ with a commitment to the highest standards of professional conduct and to the vigorous and uncompromising establishment of the truth.

Those who have violated the high standards that police officers should abide by deserve firm treatment, the report said.

It said: ‘[The public’s] expectations are that police officers will adhere to standards of honesty and conduct which are appreciably higher than those demanded of most others. And it is in that respect that the public feel badly let down – and perhaps afraid – when police officers are exposed as having failed.’

Before he was appointed to head the HMIC, Mr Winsor wrote two reports proposing widespread and radical reforms of the police.

Until then, policing workplace practices were ‘stale and discredited’ and some officers developed a sense that forces ‘deserved to be insulated from fundamental and searching review’, he concluded.

The failure properly to combat the huge rise in cybercrime had handed the advantage to offenders and left the public at risk.

‘The internet opens a new portal in our homes to those who do us harm,’ he said.

Mr Winsor pointed to burglary detection rates among forces as low as 15 per cent and also raised ‘real concerns’ about the handling of domestic abuse cases and car crime.

And, he said, criminals have got off as a result of the sloppy writing of reports for the Crown Prosecution Service.

Labour policing spokesman Jack Dromey said the report raised serious questions about the future of British policing.

‘Public trust in the police has been damaged by allegations of misconduct, failed investigations and cover-ups,’ Mr Dromey said.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Tom Winsor’s report rightly points out that recent allegations about misconduct have damaged but not broken public confidence in the police. The majority of police officers conduct themselves honestly.’
