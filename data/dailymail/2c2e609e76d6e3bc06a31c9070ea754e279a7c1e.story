A council has defended its decision to sell the birthplace of former prime minister Sir Anthony Eden for a bargain price.

Windlestone Hall, set in 25 acres of parkland and boasting its own clock tower, stables and servants’ quarters, was expected to attract offers of more than £2million.

But six years after it first went on the market it has been sold for £241,000 - a fraction of its original valuation.

Piece of history: Windlestone Hall is thought to have been valued at nearly £2million just a few years ago

Sign of distinction: The 19th-century clocktower would have been in place when former Prime Minister Anthony Eden was born here

Deserted for years: The house has not been used since 2003, when a local authority school moved out because it needed major repairs

Elegant decor: One of several ornate ceilings within the beautiful building

In 2010, English Heritage refused the proposals by a developer who wanted to build luxury homes on the site

Opulent fashion: Classical mouldings shaped like swirling leaves and baskets of flowers decorate walls and ceilings throughout the mansion

The grade-II listed property, sold by the Eden family in the 1920s, was once a school and a former POW camp during the war, but had been empty since 2006.

Stuart Timmiss, head of assets at Durham Council, said: 'Given the condition of the building the state of the market and the very significant maintenance costs....the sale did represent best value for money for taxpayers.'

A councillor had reported the sale to the Audit Commission whose investigation highlighted a lack of transparency in selling the property after a £1.5 million deal collapsed.

Its new owners, who have chosen to remain anonymous, vowed: ‘It is a private home which is going to be renovated back to its original splendour.’

The charming house features grand staircases, Doric order columns and 12 bay windows at the front

Affluent past: Staff quarters and a stable are situated in the extensive grounds

Born at the hall: Anthony Eden was born at Windlestone in 1897, before going on to become Conservative Prime Minister in the fifties

The picturesque home, located 
near the County Durham village of Rushyford, is said to need urgent 
repairs costing an estimated £3million

County Councillor John Shuttleworth insisted the council had sold the property too cheaply. He said: ‘The property was on the market for a figure approaching £2million in 2007.

‘The council was offered £1.5million in the same year, but they turned this offer down. It is a massive, massive property, with ornate period features.

‘Even in today’s climate the land itself should be worth at least £4,000 an acre making the parkland alone worth £100,000. I think the sale for this price is totally wrong.’

The 19th century hall was first built in 1835, incorporating a section of the rear wing which dated back to 1750.

Designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi and built for Robert Thompson Eden, the property was the 1897 birthplace of the former Tory prime minister Sir Anthony Eden who led the country between 1955 and 1957.

In 2006 Durham County Council, faced 
with an £81,000 annual bill to maintain the hall, decided to sell up to a
property developer who planned to turn the hall into luxury flats.

'As the hall is a grade II listed building, we were obliged by law to protect and maintain it while it was under our ownership.

However, the proposals were  rejected by English Heritage.

Gorgeous setting: Windlestone lies within 25 acres of lush parkland

Grand interior: The hall boasts a library with dummy bookshelf, many original staircases and fireplaces - but needs major repairs

Upstairs downstairs: The northern elevation of the former staff accommodation

Glorious countryside: An earlier prospective buyer wanted to build luxury flats on the site - but the new owners intend to restore the home to its former splendour

Enduring designs: Map showing the listed buildings in and around the 19th-century home

After the deal fell through the council began looking at alternative options when it received an expression of interest which finally led to its sale.

The U-shaped home has a billiard room, a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery, stables, separate staff quarters and many original marble fireplaces.

A spokesman for English Heritage said it was of the ‘most historically significant buildings in the North East’, adding: ‘We are pleased new owners have been found and look forward to working with them and the council.’

From Baronets to blackboards: An extension was added on to Windlestone when parts of it became a school between 1957 and 2003

Windlestone Hall was built in 1835 and instantly became one of the region's grandest stately homes.

It was commissioned by Baronet Robert Johnson 
Eden, to replace his 16th-century manor, and designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi.

On
the death of the fifth Baronet in 1844, the estate and Baronetcy passed
to his cousin, Sir William Eden, the fourth Eden of Maryland Baronet, who became High Sheriff of Durham in 1848.

Anthony Eden was born there in 1897 and later served as a cabinet minister before becoming prime minister from 1955 to 1957.

The estate was then used as a prisoner of war camp for female German prisoners during the Second World War.

Afterwards it was adapted by the council to serve as a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties for nearly 50 years, between 1957 and 2006.

Windlestone Hall School added an unlisted extension to the building in the seventies, but was forced to relocate several years ago after the hall fell into disrepair.

A buyer then became interested in developing the land for luxury flats, but the deal fell through and the house has only now been sold to an unnamed buyer, who plans to restore it to its former splendour.
