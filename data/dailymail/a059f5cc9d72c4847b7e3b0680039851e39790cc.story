From being forced to dress in skimpy clothing to putting up with inappropriate behavior, a new report has lifted the lid on the 'rampant sexual harassment' of the American restaurant industry.

A staggering 90 per cent of female restaurant workers say they have been sexually harassed by customers, co-workers and management in the workplace, according to the published document.

This includes being sexually teased, pressured to date, inappropriately touched, shown sexually suggestive photos and receiving letters, calls or texts of a sexual nature.

Shocking: A new report has lifted the lid on the rampant sexual harassment of the U.S. restaurant industry. Above, 60 per cent of female workers reported that  harassment was an uncomfortable aspect of  life

It also includes being ordered by restaurant bosses to flirt with guests, expose body parts or dress in a particular manner, such as 'wearing tighter clothing or make-up to look more sexy'.

Researchers found tipped employees put up with the unwanted behavior because they depend on customers' tips to boost their minimum wage of $2.13 per hour.

This wage, which is more than $5 lower than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, has remained unchanged since 1991.

The 'endemic' sexual harassment of restaurant workers was unveiled by Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) United, which interviewed employees from across 36 states.

According to the 34-page document, named 'The Glass Floor: Sexual Harassment in the Restaurant Industry', women make up two-thirds (66 per cent) of all tipped restaurant employees. 

Alarmingly, 60 per cent of female workers reported that sexual harassment, such as groping, was an uncomfortable - and regular - aspect of working life.

Half claimed they had experienced 'scary or unwanted' behavior from customers, colleagues and their bosses, with one third experiencing harassment from customers on at least a weekly basis.

'Since women restaurant workers living off tips are forced to rely on customers for their income rather than their employer, these workers must often tolerate inappropriate behavior from customers, co-workers, and management,' the report said. 

'This dynamic contributes to the restaurant industry's status as the single largest source of sexual harassment claims in the U.S.' 

Male restaurant workers also reported high levels of sexual harassment in the workplace, with more than 50 per cent admitting receiving sexual comments, remarks or teasing.

Contrast: These figures show differences in customer behavior, experienced by male and female workers

Nearly 40 per cent said they had received inappropriate comments about their sexual orientation, while 55 percent claimed customers had sexually harassed them.

The shocking figures may account for why around 37 percent of all sexual harassment claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stem from the restaurant industry.

Saru Jayaraman, co-director and co-founder of the non-profit restaurant worker's group, RA, told USA Today: 'We need to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers in the United States.'

She added that tipped workers are wrongly being 'forced to dress and act in certain ways that make them vulnerable to customer, co-worker and manager harassment.'

Management behavior: These figures,  relating to management behavior, reveal that 20 per cent of  female workers have been told to alter their appearance beyond the restaurant's dress code by those above them

The report, compiled in cooperation with nearly a dozen women's and workers' rights groups, comes as low-wage restaurant workers increasingly push for better pay and improved rights.  

The National Restaurant Association (NRA) dismissed the report, saying that it 'takes charges of sexual harassment very seriously' and 'no individual is making $2.13 an hour'. 

It told CBC MoneyWatch: 'The assertion from ROC that the tipped wage somehow increases sexual harassment by customers is another effort to confuse the reality of the tipped wage in the industry.

'We take pride in the fact that more women own, operate and manage restaurants than virtually any other industry.'
