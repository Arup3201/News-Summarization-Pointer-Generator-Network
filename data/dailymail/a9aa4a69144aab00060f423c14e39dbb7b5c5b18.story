Once, table salt was just a big tub of Saxa decanted into a shaker. Today, a host of salts in a rainbow of colours are claiming pride of place in our dining rooms. So, are they worth their designer prices?

HIMALAYAN PINK SALT BRICK

£85, 12in platter, divertimenti.co.uk

WHAT IT IS: A huge, round slab of pink salt that looks more impressive than my marble kitchen. Top chefs are serving seafood on salt blocks instead of plates. It’s also a fun dinner party trick (just wipe with a damp cloth after each use).

Salt is a part of most foods but rarely given a second thought

Alternatively, a smaller block can be passed between guests with a grater, like a block of Parmesan, so they can serve their own salt. The blocks are harvested from the Himalayas in northern Pakistan. Salt deposits were formed 600 million years ago when an inland sea evaporated, leaving behind crystals in an eye-catching pink shade due to the presence of iron oxide.

BEST FOR: As a platter to serve a starter of prawns, scallops or smoked salmon. Or grate over tomato and mozzarella salad for a pretty glitter.

VERDICT: I served prawn mousse wrapped in smoked salmon on this slab and my guests loved it. The saltiness is absorbed delicately by the food.

I used a second slab so we could grate salt onto our main course of chicken ballotine. 5/5

GAEA SMOKED SALT

A Greek salt harvested in the shallow Messolonghi lagoons using techniques that are centuries old

£8.99 for a trio of 85g salts, lakeland.co.uk

WHAT IT IS: A Greek salt harvested in the shallow Messolonghi lagoons using techniques that are centuries old. The salt is collected, dried and smoked slowly over a beech wood fire.

Paprika is added, lending a burst of colour and a mild spice kick. The result is small crystals of an intense pink hue and an overwhelming smoky aroma.

BEST FOR: Adding a distinctive smoked flavour to blander dishes. It works well on salmon fillets (sprinkled with salt and lemon and cooked in foil), scrambled eggs or in soup.

VERDICT: When Lakeland told me this smoked salt works brilliantly with creme brulee, my favourite dessert, I thought they were joking.

I’m still not convinced they weren’t, though it certainly turned this custard pudding into a talking point. Use sparingly. 3/5

WINEMAKER’S DEEP RED SALT

£4.50 for 70g, souschef.co.uk

WHAT IT IS: If you love steak seasoned liberally and washed down with a fine red wine, then this is the perfect salt for you.

It’s infused with Merlot and Cabernet, turning it a blood- red colour. This creates such a dramatic effect that its Facebook page has been shared almost 1,000 times, making it the first salt to become a social media star.

BEST FOR: Rubbing into steak as a seasoning. The red wine flavour combines with the bite of the salt for a deep-flavoured steak and succulent juices.

Alternatively, sprinkle on a salted caramel pud for a dash of blood-red drama.

VERDICT: My children loved the look of these large crystals. I added it to lasagne — the wine taste and deep colour made a wonderful difference. 4/5

BART BLACK SALT

Striking black flakes of sea salt

£3.19 for 45g, bart-ingredients.co.uk

WHAT IT IS: Striking black flakes of sea salt. Mediterranean sea water is filtered in Cyprus, placed into large stainless steel vats and heated until salt crystals form on the bottom.

These are then dried and mixed with charcoal made in Sri Lanka from burning coconut husks. The result looks like tiny flakes of coal.

BEST FOR: Using as a decorative salt to transform ordinary food into the extraordinary. Sprinkle on a pizza topped with ripped mozzarella and Parma ham for a simple yet memorable supper.

VERDICT: This tastes like any other salt, but using it transformed me from tea-time Mum into a culinary superstar.

I stirred it into chilli instead of the usual table salt and it turned my mince a deep, rich, plum colour.

For a dinner party, I melted white chocolate and poured it into discs, then sprinkled black salt on the top and allowed the discs to set. The results looked incredible and my guests loved the combination of chocolate and salt. 5/5

SEL DE MER

£2.75 for 250g, bart-ingredients.co.uk

This salt is harvested from salt flats on an island off the French coast

WHAT IT IS: This is harvested from salt flats on an island off the French coast. Water collects naturally and is then evaporated by the sun and wind. The natural crystals are scraped up with rakes.

It is stored, but not fully dried, giving it a softer taste and the texture of wet sand.

BEST FOR: Cooking with rather than sprinkling. If you want your poached fish to have a sea water taste, it’s perfect. Also good for casseroles.

However, this ‘wet’ salt doesn’t work as a garnish at the table, as it doesn’t break down easily, leaving big lumps.

VERDICT: Don’t make the mistake I did and put it into a salt grinder. It sticks and won’t sprinkle. I liked the milder taste — it tastes like a mouthful of sea water.

Taking advantage of its wet texture, I mixed it with herbs and rubbed it on pork to make spectacular crackling. 2/5

AUSTRALIAN MURRAY RIVER SALT

£10 for 120g, eicfinefoods.com

WHAT IT IS: Peach-coloured flake salt is extracted from Australia’s biggest river basin, which is dominated by the Murray and Darling rivers.

Originally, it was farmed for use in the building trade. Then chefs tried it and discovered it was as delicious as it is pretty.

The delicate colour comes from sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron suspended within a crimson coloured brine in river basins.

Tens of thousands of years old, the brine changes composition and colour according to the weather — bleaching in the sun, but darkening in the winter — so your salt can be apricot, pale peach or almost crimson at various times.

BEST FOR: It melts quickly when you cook it, breaking down into the food, so you can adjust the seasoning quickly without having to wait for the saltiness to kick in.

However, this salt is so pretty it is best used as a garnish for baked potatoes, grilled meat and fish. I wet the rim of a Margarita glass, dipped it in the pink flakes and served spectacular cocktails to my friends.

VERDICT: So mild in flavour that the Australians say you can eat it out of your hand — and they are right.

If you can’t stomach strong tasting salt, this is the prettiest alternative you’ll ever find. If Disney did salt, it would look like this! 4/5

PERSIAN BLUE SALT

£10 for 250g, eicfinefoods.com

WHAT IT IS: Said to be one of the oldest and rarest salts in the world, it is famed for its blue colour and sharp, distinctive flavour.

When the crystals formed more than 260 million years ago, some were highly compressed without oxygen or light, causing them to turn sapphire blue.

BEST FOR: Adding a quirky decorative twist to white fish or sprinkled over beef carpaccio. The bright blue colour adds impact, but it tastes like any normal salt.

VERDICT: It comes in a jar sealed theatrically with wax and labelled so beautifully in blue and gold that it looks more like luxury bath salts than the edible kind.

Taste-wise, it is like any rock salt — crunchy and hard.

I don’t like rock salt on salad because I find the taste too harsh, so I tried this on poached white fish. The crystals melted into the fish, leaving an occasional startling blue speck. But you are paying for the colour, not the taste. 3/5
