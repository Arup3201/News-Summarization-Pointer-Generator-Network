The mother of the Muslim convert who shot dead a Canadian soldier outside Parliament on Wednesday reunited with her estranged son over lunch just days ago - the first time she'd seen him in five years. 

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan Bibeau released a statement on behalf of herself and her ex-husband saying she did not know what to say to those hurt in the attack and could offer 'no explanation' for her son's actions.

'No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time,' she said in the release on behalf of herself and Bibeau-Zehaf's father, Bulgasem Zehaf. 

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them.' 

Susan Bibeau, whose son had his passport seized after he was designated a 'high-risk traveler', works as a federal public servant for the Immigrant & Refugee board and lives in Montreal.

On Wednesday, her son gunned down 24-year-old single dad Nathan Cirillo as he stood guard by the National War Memorial in Ottawa, before running inside the Parliament and opening fire.

His shooting spree was stopped when sergeant-in-arms Kevin Vickers shot him dead. 

After the shooting, it emerged that Zehaf-Bibeau had recently converted to Islam and friends had been worried about his mental health.

A criminal court database revealed there were 13 Quebec court records dating back to June 2001 involving him, including drugs charges, weapons charges, assault causing bodily harm and robbery.

His full name according to court documents is - 'Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau'. 

His close friend David Bathurst, a fellow convert, said Bibeau had told him that he wanted to travel to the Middle East, but it is not known if he made contact with any extremists.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. 

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. 

We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' 

He says Zehaf-Bibeau insisted that he was 'only going abroad with the intent of learning about Islam and to study Arabic.' 

But sources told The Globe and Mail 'he had not been able to secure a valid travel document from federal officials, who have been taking measures to prevent Canadians from joining extremists overseas.'

It's understood that he traveled to the U.S on four occasions, most recently in 2013. Officials there are trying to trace whom he met while in the country.

Bathurst says that after friction with the elders at the house of worship, Zehaf-Bibeau was eventually asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque. 

In her statement Ms Bibeau did not reference her son's mental health or religious conversion. 

'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created,' she continued.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time.

'You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.'

Ms Bibeau works as Deputy Chairperson, Immigration Division on the Immigration and Refuge Board of Canada, according to the board's website. She joined IRB in 1990 as a refugee protection officer, working her way up over her 24-year career.

Attack: Royal Canadian Mounted Police swarmed the area as the shooting unfolded on Wednesday

Zehaf-Bibeau's father is a Libyan businessman named Bulgasem Zehaf who once owned a local restaurant, Cafe Tripoli. The couple divorced in 1999 and his father reportedly fought in Libya in 2011.

The gunman's victim, Nathan Cirillo, was revealed to be a 24-year-old father who was bringing up his six-year-old son. Friends said he had dreamed of serving his country since he was a teenager. 

On Thursday, Queen Elizabeth released a statement to Canada about the attack. 

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected,' she said.

SERGEANT-AT-ARMS Kevin Vickers is being hailed a hero for shooting dead the gunman inside Canada’s parliament.

Mr Vickers, 58, was praised by politicians for ‘selflessly keeping them safe’ after grabbing a gun he keeps in his office amid the rampage.

A hero's welcome: Mr Vickers was greeted by a moving standing ovation just hours after he stopped terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau

It was the first time he fired his gun in a career spanning nearly thirty years 

The sergeant-at-arms is the person responsible for safety and security of parliament and has the ceremonial role of carrying a gold mace into the House of Commons. Ex-policeman Mr Vickers has held the position for eight years.

MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs … owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.’

Minister Julian Fantino added that he was ‘profoundly grateful’ for Mr Vickers’ ‘selfless act.' 

In Parliament on Thursday the public servant was greeted with a moving standing ovation 

An emotional Mr Vickers gave a humble nod of his head at the ceremony as he bravely returned to work just a day after saving the lives of his co-workers 

His sister, Mary, told the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'
