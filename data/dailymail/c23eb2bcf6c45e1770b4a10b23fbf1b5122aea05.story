Just as it seemed as though Lindsay Lohan was turning a corner, disaster seems to have struck again.

Quite literally, too, as the 25-year-old allegedly struck someone while driving away from a club, and then fled the scene, according to TMZ.

And despite an initial police investigation concluding that nobody had been injured and they were therefore happy to close the case, it seems that the man 'struck' by Lindsay is to press charges.

Melee: Lindsay Lohan tries to drive her Porsche away from the Sayers Club in Hollywood late last night, she's alleged to have 'slightly struck' a club manager in the crowd

The actress herself took to Twitter and her WhoSay account to slam the rumours, and wrote: 'Scrape? This is all a complete lie. I've
been at community service. Last night, I attempted to wish a friend 
happy birthday, which I didn't even get to do because I was freaked out 
by all of the paparazzi. These false accusations are absurd.'

TMZ report that the club manager who was hit has sought medical attention and is looking to hire a lawyer.

If he does file a complaint, police will have no choice but to open a hit-and-run investigation, which would violate Lindsay's probation in her shoplifting case. 

Lindsay was in her new Porsche when she left the Sayers Club in Hollywood at just after midnight Wednesday. 

TMZ contend that LIndsay was driving out of the 
parking area when she was blocked by paparazzi and bystanders around the 
nearby Hookah Lounge. 

They wrote: 'Lindsay made contact with the manager of the Hookah Lounge with her car and then peeled out.

Police assistance: Lindsay and her friend were later pulled over by the police, but it's believed that Lohan called them to come to her aid

Denial: Lindsay Came out fighting on both her Twitter and WhoSay account

'Cops were called, came to the scene, 
interviewed people inside the Hookah Lounge -- including the manager who
was lightly struck -- and then left.

'We're told Lindsay may have been the one who called police to protect herself from paparazzi, and that's why cops came.'

They add that the manager didn't know who Lindsay was at first and that he told photographers on scene that he was fine, but that a short time later he started complaining he was injured.

The 26-year-olf 'grazed his knee' with her vehicle and only began complaining about his injury after he discovered the driver's celebrity, it is alleged.

One eyewitness told TMZ: 'He got up and started smoking his hookah.'

In hot water again: Lindsay Lohan in Beverly Hills last night before she headed to the Sayers Club in Hollywood where she's alleged to have struck a man with her car

A police spokesperson told RadarOnline.com: 'There was no evidence of a crime or a hit and run.'

But Lindsay did swap seats with her friend after the incident, she was pictured leaving in the driving seat but when she was pulled over by police - her friend was driving.

The night before this debacle her $80,000 sports car was photographed with a extensive scrape across the side.

This was BEFORE the Sayers Club incident last night, as she enjoyed dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Beverly Hills on Tuesday night.

Lindsay was pictured leaving the meal in her very battered-looking luxury vehicle.

The six-month-old black Porsche Panamera had suffered enormous scrape marks along its side.

The eye of the storm: The cavalcade of fans and photographers around Lindsay is said to have caused the later incident

Lindsay had been dining out at Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ Restaurant in Beverly Hills with her sister Ali Lohan, 18, and friends.

She dressed up for the occasion, in a blue frilly top, black skinny jeans, blue heels and a brown 'waterfall' jacket.

The Mean Girls star has recently returned to her natural red tresses after sporting a platinum 'do for several months.

Ali, 18, also had a recent makeover with a short, choppy cut to her previously long mane. Ali wore ripped jeans, a black jacket and ankle boots.

Lindsay splashed on her latest toy in October last year. The purchase set her back $80,000 - despite her being sued for $90,000 in unpaid limo fees at the same time.

Despite being panned by critics, Lohan's recent stint as a Saturday Night Live host proved a ratings winner, becoming the second-most watched episode of the season.

On a personal front, things are also improving: She is set to finish her community service assignment, which she was handed after pleading guilty in May last year to stealing a necklace from jewelry store in Venice, California.

Lindsay also served five weeks of home confinement last summer for misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation.

She has predicted she will finish her community service at Los Angeles County morgue and her counseling requirements well ahead of her March 29 deadline.

A spokesman for Lindsay declined to comment at this time.
