A Melbourne taxi cab driver has been crushed to death in a hit and run while exchanging details with another driver over a minor collision in Brighton East early Sunday morning

Police say the Melbourne taxi was rear ended by a Toyota Corolla at Brighton East at around one oclock, Sunday morning.The 13CABS driver, a 65 year old man from Aspendale Gardens, was then struck by a Mitsubishi Colt and crushed between two cars whilst exchanging details

Police say the taxi had two passengers at the time of the collision and there were three occupants, including the driver, in the Toyota.

Only a female passenger in the Corolla was taken to hospital for minor injuries.

Police say the driver of the third vehicle, a 46 year old man fled the scene on foot.

A search, including airwing and sniffer dogs, was conducted shortly after but police were unable to locate the driver.    

Superintendent Neville Taylor said it was a minor collision that became one of three serious crashes overnight.

He has called for any witnesses to the fatal crash and said it appeared alcohol, distraction and other impaired driving may have played a part.

'Here we are again on a Sunday, cleaning up the mess, cleaning up the carnage,' he said.

 Simon Purssey from 13CABS said the taxi driver's death has shocked the company.

'When something does happen, a tragedy like this for the industry, it happens and it affects everybody from the drivers to the contact centres to operators, family and friends and staff,' Mr Purssey told ABC News.

He said the man had about 10 years' experience driving taxis.

'The driver was experienced, doing his job at night and all of a sudden he's not here with us anymore, it's a tragedy.'

Police have again reminded drivers that high risk behaviour costs lives after a taxi driver was killed in a hit and run whilst exchanging details with another driver in a minor collision

13CABS also posted an article of the crash on their facebook page and urged anyone to help if they could.

It said, 'terribly sad news to report this morning. One of our fellow Drivers has sadly passed away in a traffic incident this morning. We are absolutely devastated.'

Victoria's road toll now stands at 167 deaths, 11 more than this time last year.

Police have again reminded drivers that high-risk behaviour costs lives.
