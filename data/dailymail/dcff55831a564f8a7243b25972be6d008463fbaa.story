Pakistan has rejected U.S. special envoy Marc Grossman's request to visit the country, a senior official said today.

The decision highlights the increased tensions between the uneasy allies.

Pakistan did not elaborate on its reasons.

A senior government official, who declined to be named, said: 'Ambassador Grossman asked to visit Pakistan but we conveyed to him that it was not possible at the moment.'

Tensions: U.S. special envoy Marc Grossman and Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, address a press conference in Islamabad in October. Pakistan has rejected his request to visit the country

Relations between Islamabad and Washington are at the lowest point in years, dragged down by a Nato cross-border air attack which killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on November 26.

The growing tension threatens to set back peace efforts in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the U.S. is gradually withdrawing troops after a decade of war.

Pakistan's cooperation is regarded as crucial, because of its long history of association with militant groups, to efforts to persuade the Taliban to join negotiations.

Mr Grossman, U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, is due to visit Afghanistan and Qatar this week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last Wednesday.

Pakistan said in early December it had decided to review cooperation with the U.S. and Nato.

The review is currently before parliament with no firm timeline on when recommendations will be presented to the government.

U.S. State Department spokesman Mark 
Toner said yesterday that Pakistan had decided the review should be 
completed before Grossman's next visit.

Ties between Washington and Islamabad were severely hurt in January 2011 by the killing of two Pakistanis by a CIA contractor.

The
U.S. further infuriated and embarrassed Pakistan's powerful military in
May with a unilateral special forces raid that killed Al Qaeda leader 
Osama Bin Laden.

Pakistan said the raid, of which it wasn't informed, was a violation of its sovereignty.

Relations
between Pakistan's civilian leadership and military are also at their 
worst since a 1999 coup following reports of a disputed memo allegedly 
from President Asif Ali Zardari's government seeking U.S. help in 
reining in Pakistan's powerful generals.
