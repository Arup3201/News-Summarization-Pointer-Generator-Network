Labour's shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell called for a change in workplace culture so fathers feel able to take more time off with their children

Young fathers have the 'worst of all worlds' because they are expected to help with childcare but their bosses won't let them have time off, Labour’s childcare guru has claimed.

Shadow minister Lucy Powell revealed even her own husband refused to take more than two weeks’ paternity leave, fearing the reaction from his colleagues in the NHS.

In an interview with MailOnline, Miss Powell suggests paternity pay could have to rise unless there is a culture change for it to become more acceptable to men - and their employers - to share the burden of raising their children.

New rules come into force in April next year allowing new parents to share the 52 weeks of leave previously only available to mothers.

But a Labour government forerunner which let dads enjoy some ‘additional paternity leave’ was taken up by just 1 per cent of new fathers.

In an interview ahead of Fathers’ Day on Sunday, Miss Powell warned passing laws was not enough to ensure new dads took time off work when a child is born.

She claimed young fathers had the ‘worst of all worlds’ because they are expected to share childcare responsibilities at home, without the support at work.

Fathers must get ‘angry’ with political and business leaders to demand fairer treatment, she adds.

Miss Powell was elected in 2010, and gave birth to Tom in May last year. She has a daughter, Katie, and a step-son, Joe.

She took maternity leave from the Commons, and tried to persuade husband James Williamson, a doctor, to make use of the Additional Paternity Leave rules, which allow fathers to use up some unused maternity leave once the baby is 20 weeks old.

Miss Powell told MailOnline: ‘When I was off this time last year I said to my husband “I’ll be going back after four or five months, why don’t you take a couple of months off?” because he would have been able to do that under this scheme.

‘But he said “well how do you think that’s going to go down at work".

‘He’s a doctor, so he works in the NHS which you’d think would be more open-minded about such things.’

Miss Powell wants to put childcare at the centre of a big policy offer in Ed Miliband's general election manifesto

Maternity leave was first introduced in 1975, but was only extended to all working women in 1993.

New dads got paternity leave in 2003, and are entitled to two weeks  at £138.18 per week.

The last Labour government introduced Additional Paternity Leave, which offered between 2 and 26 weeks depending on how much unused maternity leave their partner had left once they returned to work once the baby was 20 weeks old.

It was supposed to allow both parents to share the time spent with their new baby in their first year.

But ministers have admitted that in 2012-13 just 3,867 fathers took the option of extra leave, just 1.4 per cent of those thought to be eligible.

When shared parental leave is introduced by the coalition from  April next year, parents will be able to split the full 52 weeks leave - paid for 39 weeks.

Lucy Powell said: 'Where something like additional paternity leave is designed to help that transition, it's obviously not being taken up.

'The reality is shared parental leave probably won't be much more than this. It's not the panacea that people might think it is.'

If Labour’s childcare champion cannot persuade her own husband, what hope is there for the rest of the country?

‘It’s definitely cultural,’ she says. ‘The example of my husband, I think that’s often how dads feel themselves but also how they are made to feel in the workplace.’

In addition to the woeful take up of extra paternity leave, official figures show fathers are half as likely as mothers to ask for flexible leave, and half as likely again to have the request granted.

‘There’s a real perception in the workplace that dads won’t share the caring responsibilities, don’t need those allowances being made.

‘So there’s reluctance for them to ask.’

The answer, for now, is to tackle the cultural barriers, more high profile successful dads working flexibly, politicians taking a lead.

But if that does not work, fathers might need a more blatant inducement: hard cash.

‘All the evidence we have heard about shared parental leave is there is that extra barrier about pay and status because dads are the ghee earner in the couple’, Miss Powell says.

‘So the statutory pay for this additional maternity leave, it’s three months of statutory paternity which is often not significant enough.

‘And it will be the same with shared parental leave.’

Increasing paternity pay is ‘definitely’ something that Labour will look at.

She says paternity pay could ‘potentially’ be paid as a proportion of a new father’s salary, so high earners do not see their income slump so dramatically.

‘Obviously offering additional pay isn’t cheap,’ she cautions.

‘I haven’t got money in my back pocket to be able to do this.

‘But what I would personally endeavour to do is really champion the cause of dads and try and get some of this cultural shift into the system first of all.

‘And then see if, later on, further changes are needed, we will have to look at where we might be able to fund that from.’

Even with the economy now growing, and employment rising at record levels, many working men would be reluctant to demand extra rights when being in a job at all is the priority.

But Miss Powell insists that dads themselves have to make the case for more rights in the workplace.

She likens it to the struggle two decades by women to get enhances maternity rights.

‘I would call on dads to get a little bit more angry about what provisions they have and be a bit more demanding about that’ she adds.

Young fathers are the ‘most frustrated, dissatisfied members of the workforce’, Lucy Powell said (file picture)

She points to a recent study which showed young dad were the ‘most frustrated, dissatisfied members of the workforce’.

‘For the new generation of dads there is a feeling that the caring responsibilities will be more evenly shared within the couple - and dads want to play that role at home - while also being successful at work.

‘In a sense dads are that new group who have got the kind of worst of all words really.

That’s why I say they need to start being demanding themselves, but we as politicians and business leaders need to rise to that challenge as well otherwise it’s going to be dads demanding it, maybe in not a very nice way.

‘All the evidence shows that if there is time taken off by dads when the baby is first born that that bonding is really critical and can then lead to much more secure relationships throughout that child’s life.

‘So it’s really good for children to do that. But also if we want a society where some of the gender inequalities are reduced, where caring responsibilities are seen as more fairly shared, then we have to enable dads to play the part they often want to play in doing that.

‘So it’s good for children and I think it’s good for society as a whole.’
