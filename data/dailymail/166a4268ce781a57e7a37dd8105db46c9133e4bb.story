BBC bosses were well aware of allegations about Sir Jimmy Savile’s targeting of teen girls as long ago as the 1970s, former staff have claimed.

Despite increasing evidence of abuse carried out on BBC premises, the corporation has said it has no record of complaints about him.

However, former BBC Press officer Rodney Collins insisted the BBC was ‘certainly’ aware of allegations about the star when he was there in the 1970s.

Former press officer Rodney Collins claims that the late Douglas Muggeridge, a former Radio 1 controller, knew of the allegations involving Jimmy Savile and underage girls

He revealed that he had been called 
in to see his boss at the time, Douglas Muggeridge, controller of Radio
1 and Radio 2, and was asked to investigate the possibility that claims
about the TV presenter were going to appear in the Press.

Mr Collins said he was told by the radio  boss that there were 
allegations involving underage girls surrounding a programme the star 
was making for Radio 1, called Savile’s Travels. This saw the presenter 
travelling around the country in a caravan.

In addition, a former Top of the Pops dancer said her fellow performers 
made complaints to BBC staff and the producer of the show about Savile’s
lewd behaviour.

The actress and model, who danced for Top of the Pops 
between 1964 and 1966, said staff working on the programme were aware 
that the presenter targeted young girls and dragged them into his 
dressing room.

She added that she even complained directly to the show’s producer, who 
had also received reports of abuse from other dancers, but the problem 
was ignored.

She said: ‘He once tried to pull me in… but I managed to get away.’

The commemorative plaque outside Sir Jimmy Savile's flat in Scarborough has been vandalised after allegations have been made about the TV presenter

Earlier in the week other ex-BBC staff said bosses had ‘turned a blind 
eye’ to his behaviour and that it had been an ‘open secret’.Ex-Press 
officer Mr Collins speaking to the BBC said when he checked with 
newspapers about the allegations he was told they were unlikely to be 
printed ‘because Jimmy Savile does a lot for charity’.

He added Mr 
Muggeridge was an honourable man and thought if he had felt there was 
weight to the allegations he would have made full inquiries.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The comments made by the former Press officer 
reflect a conversation that he says he had in 1973 about allegations 
that the controller of Radio 1 had heard but he does not refer to any 
formal complaint having been made.’

Fresh accusations about Jimmy Savile have been made today by a former BBC press officer

Savile 
was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award 
which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and 
broadcasting in 1971.

The new accusations come as the BBC made a humiliating U-turn, as it finally announced a joint inquiry
with police into claims that Savile abused underage girls.

The
about-face came on the eve of last night's devastating ITV programme, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, which alleged that the star exploited his fame to rape and molest 
girls as young as 12.

In the past few days, the BBC 
insisted it had searched old files and found ‘no record’ of any 
misconduct.

But a chorus of victims has claimed Savile groomed them by 
offering tickets to attend his hit shows such as Top of the Pops and his
Radio One show.

The scandal around the dead star has deepened, with some vandals daubing 'paedophile' and 'rapist' on the commemorative plaque outside his former Scarborough home.

The fresh accusations come after it was alleged yesterday that the Jim'll Fix It star raped a woman when she was 16.

The grandmother, now 65, claims she met Savile in 1963 when she was invited to speak on Radio Luxembourg, for which he was a DJ, about her Elvis Presley fan club.

He told her he was going to meet Elvis the following month and asked her to give him a photograph of herself that he could show The King.

The teenager obliged and was delighted when, upon his return, Savile phoned her home to invite her to his London hotel because

he had a gift to give her ‘from Elvis’.

The junior secretary walked to his Russell Square hotel after work, feeling ‘as if I had died and gone to heaven because I was about to speak to a man who had met Elvis’.

But she says when he answered the door to his hotel room he was wearing his pyjamas, pinned her against a wall and then raped her.

The BBC said they had no record of any written allegations about Sir Jimmy Savile's misconduct
