A German Green party leader has taken the Ice Bucket Challenge to a new high - by dousing himself in icy water while stood next to a marijuana plant.

Cem Oezdemir took part in the charity craze while on a Berlin rooftop with the waist height plant in shot as part of a call for the legalisation of cannabis.

Mr Oezdemir, whose party supports legalising
 the drug for adults, acknowledged that the plant was indeed a 'subtle political 
statement'.

Mr Oezdemir, whose party supports legalising the drug for adults, acknowledged that the plant was indeed a 'subtle political statement'

After speculation about the plant swept social media he told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ): 'Yes, it is a cannabis plant.

'In a free society it should be up to each individual person to decide whether they want to consume cannabis and take the associated risks,' he told the newspaper.

Possession, cultivation and consumption of cannabis is illegal in Germany although carrying small amounts is tolerated. In July, a court ruled that seriously ill patients could cultivate their own.

Cem Oezdemir is one of many public figures and ordinary citizens around the world to take the challenge to raise funds to fight Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Motor Neurone Disease (MND).

Many other politicians are also getting in on the act.

Former U.S. President George W. Bush completed the challenge and nominated Bill Clinton to do it after him. Barack Obama has refused to do it, giving a donation instead. Here, Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond have done itÂ  - and David Cameron was also nominated by Russell Brand and Katie Price.

The Prime Minister has declined and given a donation instead.
