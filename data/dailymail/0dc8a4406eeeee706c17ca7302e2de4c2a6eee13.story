A woman who received more than ten love letters from her boyfriend before Valentine's Day this year published them online for all the world to see - even though he didn't write them. 

Brandon Garner found 15 letters  John Edwin Walker wrote to the love of his life, Annie Elizabeth Goodyear, in 1916.

Garner, who found the handwritten letters in a brick wall in a 19th century building in Raleigh, North Carolina, during renovations, promptly gave the notes to his girlfriend Kathryn Volpe.

The letters from Walker to Goodyear were from 1916 and they were written on monogrammed stationery

A trove of 15 love letters from 1916, discovered during renovation of a 19th century building in Raleigh, N.C.

After she got her hands on the letters, which were written in longhand on monogrammed stationery, Volpe decided to publish them  on her bakery's website.

She was hoping to spread some ore-Valentine's Day love and also wanted to get help identifying the couple so she could give the letters to their family members. 

Volpe also fell in love with Walker and Goodyear according to theLos Angeles Times. 

It didn't hurt that Garner actually read several of the letters aloud to Volpe after he realized how much she liked them

She said: 'As cheesy as it sounds, I got that warm, fuzzy feeling — just all gushy inside. 

'Anyone who has truly loved someone can identify with J. Edwin [John], even if they can't articulate their feelings as beautifully as he does.'

Several of the 'tough guys' who were helping Garner renovate the building, which is now a martial arts gym, were also 'smitten' by the letters.

After she got the letters, Volpe began publishing them on her bakery's website to help spread the love

Goodyear (pictured above) and Walker married in 1918 and then they separated in 1930 but did not divorce

The letters, which Walker wrote while he was living in a YMCA in Virginia, contain phrases such as 'yield up your own precious being to the impassioned arms and lips of him who bears this love for you' and 'sometimes a man will lose his useless head completely when his own love gives him the precious privilege of looking into her eyes'.

Volpe published the last of the letters on Valentine's Day, along with all of the information she has about the couple.

The final letter begins, 'My Lovely Sweetheart' and was sent in August of 1916.  It reads: 'How happy I was after you phoned me last night.

'I had been trying for a long long time to go asleep, but I couldn't. 

1918: John Edwin Walker and Annie Elizabeth Goodyear were married.

1920-21: Lived in Atlanta, Georgia, with John Edwin working for Nash Motor Company.

1922-29: Lived in Raleigh with John working for Nash Motor Company and Southern Refrigerator Company.

Early 1930: Lived in Springfield (question as to whether Missouri or Illinois.

Later 1930: John and Annie separated but did not divorce. Annie went to Charlottesville, Virginia, to work at St. Anne's. John went to Sanford, North Carolina.

1971: John passed away in Sanford and Annie came down from Virgina to handle his affairs.

1990: Annie passed away in Charlottesville.

'Every moment found me more wakeful; and then the bell rang – cheerfully – surprisingly cheerful came your dear voice over the wire saying - “Are you there?” 

'My own Darling, surely the people in the story we read were not more happy than are we in the new joy we found in the phone last night. 

'And you discovered it! Just like you discovered me – and my heart and soul. O the vibrant whispers – they were so sweet. You were at my side!

'Then when you hung up, you came running, and in a minute you had found the haven of rest I had made for you in my arms, and with your own arms about me and mine around you, in the full knowledge of God, and with the most wonderful bliss of love to us, we slept!' 

Records show that Goodyear and Walker were married in 1918. 

He was 26; she was 22. 

They lived in Raleigh for more than ten years before hitting a rough patch and separating in 1930. 

The couple never officially divorced, but Goodyear began living in Virginia while Walker remained in North Carolina. 

Walker died alone of  'diverticular colon' in 1971 at the ago of 70. 

After his death, Goodyear traveled to North Carolina to deal with her husband's affairs. 

She died 19 years later in 1990 at age 94.

Volpe summed up their story like this: 'J. Edwin and Annie were in their early 20s when he wrote the love letters, and there is no doubt that his professions of devotion and adoration were truly genuine. 

'They were in love, got married, moved around the country, and then...who knows? 

'We can speculate for days on why they might have separated, but at one time, they loved each other deeply and were able to realize it in marriage and life together. 

'And that, to me, is a happy story.'

When she published, the final letter today, Volpe revealed she had an ulterior motive for sharing Goodyear and Walker with the world.

She wrote: 'Before we get to the final letter, I must confess the third reason I wanted to publish these. 

'I was hoping to inspire people (my boyfriend included) to take a cue from J. Edwin and start penning love notes...' 

Only time will tell if Garner takes the hint.
