A Briton died in a mudslide while renovating the Spanish holiday home where he planned to retire.

Andrew McGaughey, 65, was buried to his neck when the ground gave way as he filled a ditch with concrete.

The divorced father-of-two had told neighbours he was worried about cracks that had appeared in the walls of the property, near Torrox a half-hour drive east of Malaga.

Local police had to assess the situation at the house after the mudslide, the foundations of which had been said to be unstable for a period of time

The retired Briton had been planning on living in the house all year round following renovations to the property

The accident was possibly due to heavy rain from strong storms dislodging the soil under and around the house

Dutch neighbour Gertrudis Van Delf said: 'He’d been saying for some time he was worried about the stability of the house because of subsidence.

'He had just retired and was planning on coming to live here all year round.'

The man’s girlfriend had spent Christmas with him at the property, but returned to the UK just over a week before the tragedy.

Mr McGaughey had started the repair work around the same time.

It is not known where in UK the victim is from.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Malaga said: 'Everything is pointing to a freak accident.'
