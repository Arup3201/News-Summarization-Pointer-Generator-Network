Hundreds of patients queued for more than four hours to say goodbye to a cherished GP when he retired from practice after 32 years.

Described affectionately as a 'good old fashioned' doctor, Dr Richard Hughes was adored for the way he took time to get to know people and talk through their issues - rather than to simply treat patients as 'a number'.

His decision to retire from Hanway Medical Practice in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was met with dismay and receptionists were deluged with requests for appointments with the 60-year-old medic just so people could wish him farewell.

But staff were unable to fit them all in, so decided to open specially for two hours on a Saturday afternoon to accommodate their requests.

Thanks, and goodbye: Patients queue down the street to bid a fond farewell to beloved doctor Richard Hughes, who is retiring after 32 years. He was well-liked for his efforts to get to know those he cared for

In the end, they were forced to remain open for over four hours after hundreds of people formed a queue around the block.

They arrived with cards and gifts - including food hampers - and joined him for a chat, tea, coffee, and cake.

Dr Hughes qualified as a doctor in London in 1977 before settling in Portsmouth in 1980.

He worked at the city’s St Mary’s Hospital before completing his GP training at the Hanway Medical Practice, where he worked until he retired.

Practice manager Denise Fenton, 57, said: 'Richard was completely humbled by the turnout but it came as no surprise to the other staff.

The practice manager said: 'Richard was like your old-fashioned doctor, who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally.' Pictured (left to right) Patient Atik Miah, Dr Richard Hughes and patient Sue Louth

'We were bombarded with requests for appointments with him since he announced his retirement, and we couldn’t fit everybody in.

'We told patients we would open for a couple of hours one weekend so we could leave the week day appointments for medical matters.

'But even that wasn’t enough. Hundreds of people queued around the block, so we were forced to extend the drop-in session.'

She added: 'Richard was like your old-fashioned doctor, who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally.

'He would be the first person in in the morning and the last to leave at night - sometimes as late as 11pm.

'He was always over-running because he spent so much time talking to patients. However, nobody seemed to mind waiting for him to catch up, as long as they could get to see him.

'His departure is a huge loss to the surgery, but we wish him well.'

Dr Hughes said: 'As soon as I qualified in 1982, I knew it was the place I wanted to be. I have always liked knowing people and finding out about their families, so it was a perfect job for me.

'I have never disliked anyone I met and have enjoyed working as a GP. All my patients have been so unique.

'There are thousands of stories that I will take with me, and all of them so individual. I will miss all the staff there, they have always been so superb and one of the reasons why I’ve enjoyed working there so much.

'I was very touched to see how many people came to say goodbye to me. I’m lucky to have had such a great career.'

During his time, Dr Hughes took a special interest in diabetes care, and also started training junior doctors.

Patient Sue Louth, 62, who visited the surgery to wish him good luck, said: 'He had been my GP for more than 30 years and was the best.

'He always had time for you, would listen to your problems and ask after your whole family. He took care of you and treated you as an individual - he always went that extra mile.'

Dr Hughes will use his retirement to spend more time with his wife Theresa, and his three children.

He would also like to enjoy conservation and wildlife hobbies.

Ed Miliband's promise to guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours could cost £3billion, doctors warned today.

Labour
 has set aside just £100million to pay for the policy, launched last 
night to bolster support as polls put the Tories ahead for the first 
time in two years.

Today
 the Royal College of GPs said the £3billion would need to be found from
 elsewhere in the NHS to reverse the 'erosion' of funding to local 
surgeries over recent years.

Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their GP within 48 hours

In
 a speech last night Mr Miliband said it was a ‘scandal’ that many 
patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would 
plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times.

He
 claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times 
would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid 
consultants.

But Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge.

She
 told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The £100 million is a start and 
it’s a welcome start. It’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any
 sort of guarantee. 

'When
 you look at it, it’s around about £10,000 per practice. It certainly 
won’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses, more 
GPs.

'At
 the moment the share of NHS funding that goes to general practice is 
just over 8 per cent. We see about 90 per cent of all NHS consultations.
 We believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent.'

She
 said this was the equivalent of 'a rebalancing of  £3billion because 
that is the share of the NHS budget that historically came to general 
practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want'. 

Dr
 Baker added: 'That funding has been eroded over the years and we need 
to be able to balance NHS funding to deliver a proper general practice 
service.' 

Labour
 claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours 
has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, with 
one in four people have to wait a week to be seen.

Mr Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe ahead of his policy launch, which has since been criticised for a lack of funding

Mr
 Miliband said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an 
appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save 
the NHS more than £300million.

‘This
 will be better for patients, because they have better access to their 
GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently 
spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of 
health service we need’, he said.

The
 Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said 
they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it 
counter-productive to patient care.

Mr
 Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow 
patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a 
receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to 
need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day.

All
 patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within 
48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their 
choice.

The
 number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80
 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, Mr Miliband

Chaand
 Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this 
policy was suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, 
are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the 
situation worse.

He
 added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when 
practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the 
freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients 
with long-term conditions.’ 

Labour
 sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the 
previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see 
their own GP will still be able to.

GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours.

The
 cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal 
fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a 
month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the 
Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units.

Mr
 Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal 
the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of 
health budgets.

A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Once
 again Labour's sums simply don't add up. Ed Miliband promised 'iron 
discipline' on spending, but he's too weak to stick to it. He's got no 
economic plan to secure Britain's future. 

'All
 he does offer are more of the same old failed Labour policies from the 
past - more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.'
