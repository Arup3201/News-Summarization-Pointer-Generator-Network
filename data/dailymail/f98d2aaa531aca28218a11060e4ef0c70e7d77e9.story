Huge: This serrated Tyrannosaurus tooth was found with other Alamosaurus bones by the researchers

The enormous bones of what is believed to be the biggest dinosaur in the U.S. have been unveiled by university researchers.

A research paper produced jointly by the Museum of Rockies in Montana State and the State Museum of Pennsylvania describes two gigantic vertebrae and a femur that the team collected in New Mexico from 2003 to 2006.

The bones belong to the sauropod dinosaur Alamosaurus sanjuanensis: a long-necked plant eater related to Diplodocus.

The Alamosaurus roamed what is now the southwestern region of the U. S and Mexico about 69 million years ago.

In the paper, Montana State University researcher, Denver W. Fowler and Robert M. Sullivan from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania write how carrying the the vertebrae alone was a 'killer' task taking up an entire day because the paleontologists carried them 1.2 miles through 100-degree heat.

Dr Fowler said: 'Alamosaurus has been known for some time, its remains were first described in 1922 from the Naashoibito beds of New Mexico.

'Since then, more bones have been discovered in New Mexico, Utah, some really nice material from Texas, and Mexico, including a few partial skeletons.'

He said the sheer size of the new bones had caught the researchers by surprise.

He said researchers had believed that a fully grown Alamosaurus measured around 60 feet long and weighed about 30 tons.

But a 2009 study by another MSU researcher, Dr. Holly Woodward, led to discovery of a femur thought to belong to an adult that was still growing.

Dr Fowler said. 'This told us that Alamosaurus got even bigger, but we didn't imagine that it could get quite this big.'

The enormity of the new bones puts 
Alamosaurus in the same size league as other giant sauropods from South 
America, including Argentinosaurus which weighed about 70 tons, and is 
widely considered to be the biggest dinosaur of all.

Dr
Fowler added: 'Over the past 20 years, Argentinean and Brazilian 
paleontologists have been unearthing bigger and bigger dinosaurs, 
putting the rest of the world in the shade.

Comparison: It is difficult for researchers to estimate body size from only fragmentary remains, but overlapping skeletal material gives an indication of maximum sizes for the biggest dinosaurs

'However, our new finds not only show that Alamosaurus is newly recognized as the biggest dinosaur from North America, but also that it was right up there with the biggest South American species: the US is back in the fight for the No.1 spot.'

Although comparison of the new Alamosaurus bones with the South American species gave the researchers an idea of size, giant specimens of sauropods like Alamosaurus and Argentinosaurus are only known from very fragmentary remains.

This means they only offer a glimpse of what a complete Alamosaurus might look like.

'We'd love to find more complete material', said Dr Fowler.

'Fortunately, Alamosaurus bones are quite common in the Naashoibito of New Mexico, so we have a good chance 
of going back and finding more, but in order to dig up one of the 
world's biggest dinosaurs you need one of the world's biggest dinosaur 
digging teams and large digging equipment.'

The Pennsylvania State Museum field 
crew is made up of just two to three people, so there are limits on how 
many bones can be collected in one season.

Even
so, many new and important specimens have been recovered over the past 
10 to 15 years, including new species, and other members of the fauna 
including the iconic carnivore Tyrannosaurus.

'We found a shed Tyrannosaurus tooth with another Alamosaurus neck bone that we were excavating,' Dr Fowler said.

'The Tyrannosaurus may have lost its tooth while feeding on an Alamosaurus carcass.'

He added that other recent discoveries by paleontologist Jack Horner's paleo lab at the Museum of the Rockies have emphasised the importance of understanding growth and ontogeny in interpreting dinosaur evolution.

'Increasingly, we're finding that very large or small individuals often look very different, and are often described as different species.

'Our findings show that Alamosaurus was originally described based on immature material, and this is a problem as characteristics that define a species are typically only fully gained at adult size.

'This means that we might be misinterpreting the relationships of Alamosaurus and possibly other sauropod dinosaurs too.'
