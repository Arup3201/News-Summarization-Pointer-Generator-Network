An open jail has been condemned as a laughing stock after a second prisoner went missing in a week – bringing the total on the run to 82.

Burglar Greg Disbrey, 27, simply walked out of Ford Open Prison on Monday and has not been seen since.

Three days before, thug Lucas Lamb absconded from the Category D facility in Arundel, West Sussex.

Sussex Police said Disbrey has links to Edgware in north London and Devon, and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and handling stolen goods in 2012.

The jail holds 521 inmates - meaning the total who have absconded are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity.

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked their money is being used to run a laughing stock of a prison.

‘They rightly expect that prisoners are not able to wander off at their leisure.’

Yesterday figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request revealed that the two men bring the total missing from Ford to 82.

This includes two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s.

Justice campaigner Peter Cuthbertson slammed the lax security at the prison.

The director of the campaign group Centre for Crime Prevention said: 'Open prisons in general and HMP Ford in particular have a terrible record for prisoner escapes.

'Eighty-two separate cases is an appalling figure.

'It is dangerous to rely on prisons that have such a bad record of escapes, and it’s high time to stop the overuse of open prisons.'

Police described Disbrey as white, 5ft 7ins tall and with a pierced eyebrow, two large moles behind his right ear and a tattoo of a cross on his right forearm.

The Ministry of Justice declined to comment.
