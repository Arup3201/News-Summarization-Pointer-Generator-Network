Ever wanted to dine like a dictator? We can't say we have but now you can thanks to a recipe book which reveals the favourite dishes of some of the world's most notorious leaders.

Dictators' Dinners, a bad taste guide to entertaining tyrants is a cookbook like no other as it reveals the favourite foods of murderous men including Hitler and Stalin - and how you can recreate their best-loved dishes at home.

Authors Victoria Clark and Melissa Scott describe the book as a 'blend of history, photo album and recipe book' as they reveal the foods that could sustain a tyrant.

Hitler pictured dining with Eva Braun: He used to wait 45 minutes after his food had been taste-tested before eating in case it was poisoned

They write in their foreword: 'We very much hope this book will amuse and inform readers, but also acquaint them with some exotic cuisine and, by the by, remind them just how thin the line between man and monster can be.' 

The book offers a fascinating insight into the lives of the leaders via the food they ate, as we reveal below... 

JOSEPH STALIN

Dinners times in the Russian communist dictator's company sound like a British students' night out.

Drinking games, food fights and singing and dancing were all commonplace.

But while students are all about having fun, Stalin's parties provided another opportunity for him to exert his control, humiliate people and expose their weaknesses.

Enforced merriment: Stalin used to host raucous dinner parties and one of his starters was satsivi, a type of chicken soup, right

Singing and dancing was not an expression of joy but a compulsory act enforced by the fearsome leader.

Meanwhile, he would relish drinking his guests under the table to again prove his superiority. 

Clark and Scott write: ''Guess the Temperature' was one of Stalin's favourite drinking games and reduced many guests to staggering, incontinent wrecks.'

Stalin's dinner parties could often last for six hours with the cuisine influenced by his Georgina roots including food such as walnuts, garlic, plums and pomegranates.

Given his penchant for excess eating and drinking, the authors conclude he's just as likely to have died from a stroke than poisoning at the age of 75. 

ADOLF HITLER 

Clark and Scott reveal that while Hitler had more compassion for animals than he did for people, he was not a devoted vegetarian.

It was documented on more than one occasion that he ate dishes such as pigeon and liver.

Hitler was renowned as a vegetarian but it has been documented that he regularly ate bird meat so the cookbook includes a recipe for squabs, right

A British chef called Dione Lucas who worked at a Hamburg hotel in the early 1930s confirmed the Nazi leader's love of bird meat.

She told readers of her Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook in 1964: 'I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a great favourite with Mr Hitler who dined at the hotel often.'

Such was his fear of being poisoned, Hitler had 15 food-tasters to ensure his meals were safe for him to eat.

Clark and Scott write: 'Only after a period of 45 minutes had elapsed without any taster dropping dead was a dish deemed safe for transportation to Hitler's table.' 

And while people starved during the Second World War or lived on rations, he carried on feasting like a king.  

The book quotes one of his food tasters, Margit Wolf, who was struck by the 'superior quality' of the fuhrer's meals. She said: 'There was asparagus in season, with Hollandaise sauce, vegetable broths with little semolina dumplings, roasted red peppers, rice, salads and vegetable stews'.  

BENITO MUSSOLINI

Had dictator Benito Mussolini been given the chance to rule the world he would have made all his subjects eat an Italian diet.

According to the book, he once said that 'French cooking was worthless and Italian the best in the world.'

Mussolini thought Italian food was the best in the world and his family favourite dessert, Ciambellone, right, does look tasty

But that doesn't mean he feasted on pasta and pizza. One of his favourite dishes was a less appetising salad of roughly chopped raw garlic, dressed with oil and lemon.

The authors reveal that Mussolini's tyranny may have ended earlier than 1945 if he hadn't made changes to his diet.

They explained how he was diagnosed with an enlarged liver, heightened blood sugar and a deformed colon but 'a revised diet that included rabbit and chicken brought about a startling improvement.' 

SADDAM HUSSEIN 

Fish was a favourite dish of the notorious leader of Iraq who ruled with a iron fist from 1937 to 2006.

The books reveals he could eat it at any time of the day and loved it as fresh as possible.

Saddam Hussein loved his fish cooked fresh so he would often make his staff grill it for him as early as 5am. The recipe book reveals how to cook one of his favourites, carp, right 

They state: 'On occasion, he would rouse his kitchen staff at five or six in the morning to grill some fish he'd just caught.'

His callous, murderous attitude was even revealed when he ate as the book reveals how 'once, as he chewed olives he told his former chief of intelligence he was spitting out the stones in "the way I will one day spit out the Israelis from their land".'

MUAMMAR GADDAFI

Vain as well as powerful, Libyan ruler Gaddafi had a secret weapon to ensure he always had a pearly white smile - camel milk.

But Clark and Scott observe that the beauty treatment came with unfortunate side effects.

Vain: Gaddafi used to drink camel milk to enhance the whiteness of his teeth

'The camel milk Gaddafi liked to drink may have enhanced the brilliant whiteness of his smile but it seems to have played havoc with his digestion. Whether he suffered from uncontrollable flatulence or whether, on the other hand, he was able to exploit this affliction to emphasize whatever point he was engaged in making, as demonstrated in an interview with John Simpson, is debatable.

'Certainly, on a visit to his tent in 2004, Tony Blair was advised not to accept a glass of camel milk, lest he be similarly afflicted,' they write.

One of his favourite meals was a dish from his home country - camel meat with couscous - but he also had a penchant for Italian food - despite banishing Italians from Libya.

KIM JONG-IL

The recipe book reveals how the former leader of North Korea was as fastidious as he was cruel.

They write: 'Hundreds of his luckless people were recruited to the project of preserving his health and vigour by way of his diet. A small army of women was employed to see that every grain of rice destined for his plate was uniform in size, shape and colour. 

Kim Jong-Il would often feast while his people starved. Shark's fin soup was one of his favourite dishes but as they are now a protected species, the cookery cook recommends using soy or chicken breast instead

'It then had to be cooked over a fire using only trees cut from a mountain peak near the Chinese border.'

He loved sushi and it was once reported he 'enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its "mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing."' 

More evidence of his cruelty is shown by the way he had 'live lobsters airlifted to his train as it crossed Siberia on its way to Moscow... and he had food grown for him alone, while North Koreans starved.'

Bon appetit: Camel meat

2 medium onions, finely chopped

Salt and pepper

2 tsp of cinnamon

Il/ 2pt of water

Rose water

1kg/2lb 4oz camel meat diced

2 cinnamon sticks

3 cardamom pods

Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in pan. Add and cook half the onions until golden.

Stir in the chickpeas and 1 tbsp of tomato paste, season with salt, pepper and 1 tsp of cinnamon then add 150ml of the water.
