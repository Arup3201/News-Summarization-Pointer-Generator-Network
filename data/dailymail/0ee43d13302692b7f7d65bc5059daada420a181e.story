Palestinians have accepted an Egyptian plan for a new 72-hour ceasefire despite Israel keeping away from talks this weekend. 

It is hoped the truce with Israel would clear the way for a resumption of talks about a long-term ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. 

However, Israel walked away from discussions after militants resumed their rocket fire on southern Israel with the expiration of an earlier three-day truce.Scroll down for video.

Today's decision was aimed at bringing the Israelis back to the negotiations. 

There was no immediate Israeli response. 

A Palestinian negotiator said: 'We are here to look for an agreement. We cannot have an agreement without talks, so we accepted an Egyptian proposal to have a cease-fire for 72 hours in order to resume the talks.'

He, along with other Palestinian negotiators who confirmed the decision, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the negotiations with the media. 

The Egyptian-mediated talks are aimed at brokering a long-term truce arrangement between Israel and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip following the heaviest fighting between the bitter enemies since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.

In nearly a month of fighting, more than 1,900 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians, nearly 10,000 were wounded and thousands of homes destroyed. Sixty-seven people were killed on the Israeli side, including three civilians. 

The fighting ended in a temporary 72-hour cease-fire last Tuesday, during which Egypt had hoped to mediate a longer-term agreement. 

But when the three-day window expired, militants resumed their rocket fire, sparking new Israeli reprisals.

The violence has continued throughout the weekend, albeit not as strong as at the height of the fighting. 

Earlier Sunday, Palestinians threatened to quit the negotiations if Israel did not return, while Israeli leaders said there would be no talks while the rocket fire continues. 

'Israel will not negotiate under fire,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today, warning his country's military campaign 'will take time.'

Hamas is seeking an end to an Israeli-Egypt blockade that has decimated the local economy. 

Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent arms smuggling and it says Hamas must disarm as part of any long-term arrangement.

Hamas has said handing over its weapons arsenal, which is believed to include several thousand remaining rockets, is inconceivable.
