Carol Howard, 35, a firearms officer with the Met Police, has been awarded £37,000 after suffering race and sexual discrimination 

Scotland Yard  leaked information about the arrest of a glamorous firearms officer in a bid to 'deflect' negative publicity surrounding her discrimination case, it has been found.

Carol Howard, 35, won a racial and sexual discrimination case against the London force in July this year, after judges ruled she had been 'bullied' while serving in the Metropolitan Police’s 700-strong Diplomatic Protection Group.

Today, Mrs Howard received £37,000 in damages after the tribunal branded the treatment of police chiefs towards the officer as ‘malicious, insulting and oppressive’.

The force was heavily criticised for releasing details of PC Howard’s arrest and suspension from duty over an unrelated dispute with her ex-husband. 

Tribunal judges found the force had leaked the information as a way to 'deflect attention' and to 'portray her in a negative light', once the tribunal had found in her favour. 

The force was also accused of deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews. 

And Mrs Howard was awarded an extra £10,000 over the fact the Met's commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe had failed to issue an apology to the officer since the ruling.  

After the hearing, Mrs Howard, from Coulson, Surrey, said she was glad the tribunal had recognised the force's 'dirty tricks' to 'smear' her name, but said that no amount of compensation could make up for what she had been through. 

She said: 'Today is not a day for celebration. I have been put through a two-year ordeal in which I have been bullied, harassed and victimised simply because of my gender and race.

'No amount of compensation will ever make up for the hurt and upset that I have been caused.

'Since I won my initial hearing, the Metropolitan Police has failed to apologise to me or express any regret at the treatment I received. The only reaction from the police was to smear my name by releasing misleading details of my arrests.

'I am glad that the tribunal recognised that this leak of information was a dirty trick by the Metropolitan Police aimed solely at deflecting criticism from itself while simultaneously seriously damaging my reputation.

'The arrests were, I believe, also motivated by revenge simply because I made a stand against police bullying. Even today I am still having to fight to clear my name, in this regard, as part of this ongoing nightmare.'

PC Howard, who was one of just two black officers in the protection group, was discriminated against for being a black woman by her boss, Acting Inspector David Kelly, the tribunal found.

Judges were highly critical of the way the Met Police dealt with the case and called for the force's internal Fairness At Work scheme to be overhauled.

She continued: 'I did not willingly seek this employment tribunal but had no other option to pursue it after various attempts to resolve the situation internally with the police proved fruitless.

The London force was criticised by employment tribunal judges for releasing details of her arrest and suspension from duty over an unrelated dispute with her ex-husband after she won the tribunal

'In that regard, I am pleased that the tribunal has recommended that the Metropolitan Police's internal complaints system is fully and independently reviewed.

'I worked extremely hard to become a firearms officer in the Diplomatic Protection Group, was proud of my job and always gave 100%.

'It saddens me that I found myself in this position through no fault of my own but I do hope that lessons can be learned from my case which will allow more officers, suffering similar discriminatory treatment, to come forward.'

Scotland Yard faced a barrage of negative media coverage over the case in July. 

Speaking outside court, Mrs Howard said she was glad the judges had recognised the force's 'dirty tricks' but that no amount of compensation could begin to make up for the two-year ordeal 

The panel found that, while the force did not name PC Howard, a draft press statement was altered to include more detail about her three arrests linked to a domestic dispute with her estranged husband.

The judges said: 'The respondent had received a lot of negative publicity and had been heavily criticised in the media as a result of the tribunal's judgment in favour of the claimant.

'We have no doubt that the second statement was issued to deflect attention and criticism from the respondent and to portray the claimant in a negative light.'

PC Howard's solicitor Kiran Daurka, senior employment lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'We are delighted with the tribunal's recognition that PC Carol Howard experienced an extremely distressing and humiliating time throughout more than a year of discrimination against her.

The London force was blasted by tribunal judges for being ‘malicious, insulting and oppressive’ and deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews

'The fact the Metropolitan Police did not issue a public apology following the tribunal's decision only exacerbated the hurt and distress felt by our client. This was reflected in the award for aggravated damages and a top award for injury to feelings.

'We now sincerely hope the tribunal's recommendations are implemented as soon as possible, as set out in the tribunal's judgement.

'In particular, we welcome recommendations there be an independent review of previous discrimination complaints brought by its own officers against the Met and also an independent inquiry into how the Met looks into future discrimination allegations.

Judges also criticised commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for failing to express any regret or to apologise for the way PC Howard had been treated

'The tribunal's powers to make these wide recommendations is currently under threat from a change in the law. The Deregulation Bill will see these tribunal powers removed in future and we will be writing to the House of Lords shortly to ask that this power be retained.

'The power to recommend significant changes is clearly so important in cases such as this where there have been findings of discrimination with potential wide spread consequences.'

PC Howard, who is currently on sick leave, was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the Met chose her to be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the Olympics.

She brought a claim of discrimination against the Met which was upheld earlier this year.

She told the London hearing that she was subjected to sexual and racial discrimination, for which she was awarded aggravated damages.  

Her award included £25,000 for injury to feelings, £10,000 for aggravated damages, £350 for the financial loss of not being able to do overtime while she was off sick with stress and depression, a 5 per cent increase of £1,767.50 for delays in dealing with the case, and £282.97 interest. 

At the end of the employment tribunal, judges found Mrs Howard had been 'singled out and targeted' for almost a year by a senior officer. 

The case also revealed a practice where advisers involved in the internal Fairness At Work complaints process were not allowed to record findings of discrimination.

A report had references to discrimination removed over concerns it would be used in a tribunal, and two other cases were cited where similar material was deleted. The system is now under review.

After she won the hearing, it emerged that Mrs Howard had been held twice by Sussex Police - once last year and once in January this year.

She was also arrested by Scotland Yard for alleged assault in April this year. 

Mrs Howard has been told that she will face no further action over the arrest by the Met Police. In relation to the arrests by Sussex police, a file is currently with prosecutors who are considering whether to bring charges.
