A grandmother has spent £4,000 covering her house in 'anti wi-fi' paint after claiming wireless signals are causing her health problems.

Stefanie Russell paid for her house in Steyning, West Sussex to be covered in four thick  coats of the special paint, and has banned mobile phone and computers from her house.

Ms Russell says that she is highly sensitive to the rays emitted by wi-fi signals and it often leaves her suffering from headaches and nausea.

Both her interior and exterior walls are being covered with the paint and Ms Russell also owns a special device, which detects unwanted wi-fi signals in her home 

She believes that her symptoms are so severe she cannot travel on public transport because of the number of portable devices being used.

Now, she is having the inside and outside of her home covered with the special paint, which costs £28 a litre and claims to block wi-fi signals from entering or leaving her house.

The 72-year-old said: 'I've not been diagnosed by a doctor but my GP surgery is aware of my condition.

'Every time I am near wi-fi or mobile phone signals I feel ill.

'It makes it difficult for me to get around and see people. I don't touch the internet or email - it's not safe.

The grandmother claims that the wi-fi signals severely affect her health and leave her experiencing headaches and nausea 

'The painting inside and outside my house is nearly complete. I feel much better now I'm more protected.'

The paint works by containing aluminium-iron oxide, which resonates at the same frequency as wifi.

It means that when it is coated on walls, signals are absorbed and blocked from entering the rooms.

Ms Russell also has a special device, which detects unwanted signals in her home.

She added: 'I have a device which helps me to detect how many wireless signals are near. I'm reassured that I will not have unwanted wi-fi guests coming into my home.

Ms Russell is having her home painted with the paint called 'bloc paint' which stops wi-fi rays from entering or leaving her home 

'Schools could use broadband instead of wi-fi, protecting them from early exposure to radiation. This is important - exposing them at an early age is essentially "cooking" our children.'

Campaigners have raised concerns that wi-fi networks could be doing untold damage to people's health.

They claim that the level of microwaves emitted by a wireless transmitter is comparable to that from a mobile phone mast.

They say that symptoms such as headaches and lapses in concentration have already been reported by some who use wifi systems frequently.

However, other studies have found that using a mobile phone or wi-fi poses no damage to health.
