Ashley Cole has explained why he declined the offer to appear in the book celebrating Arsenal's 'Invicible' season of 2003-04.

Cole made a controversial switch to west London rivals Chelsea in 2006 - a move which angered Arsenal's fans, many of whom still refuse to forgive him.

The book, released last October, featured interviews with a host of stars from that season, including Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira, but not Cole - who has now explained why.

Cole said in a series of Tweets that he will never forget his time at Arsenal 

Members of the Invincible side Ray Parlour, Lauren, Robert Pires, Sol Campbell, Jens Lehmann and Martin Keown gathered in London for a preview screening of 'Invincibles' documentary on Sky Sports

He said on Twitter: 'People asking why I'm not in the Invincibles book I thought it would be for the best. I didn't think fans would want it.

'But I will never forget my times at Arsenal and the amazing achievements I accomplished there with great people.'

The book was written by journalist and life-long Arsenal fan Amy Lawrence. She tracked down and spoke to all members of the squad and management to talk about the unbeaten season.

Cole, who was still playing for Chelsea at the time, turned down the chance to be interviewed for the book, and Lawrence thought it was due to the manner of his controversial switch from North to West London.

Cole moved to Chelsea from Arsenal on transfer deadline day in 2006

Arsenal fans made mock £20 notes to wave at Cole when Arsenal played Chelsea as they accused him of moving for money 

Cole and Arsenal fans never really made up following his departure in 2006

Cole was offered a new contract by Arsenal on wages of £55,000 per week, but in his own book, My Defence, the left back said the offer left him ‘trembling with anger’ as he had asked for £60,000 per week and felt the club were not that keen on keeping him if they were prepared to haggle over £5,000 .

Cole moved to Chelsea on transfer deadline day with the Blues offering a deal worth £90,000-a-week and the move left a bad taste in the mouth for all concerned.

Manager Arsene Wenger described the whole Cole saga as one of the regrets of his career. Cole had been earmarked by Patrick Viera to replace him as Arsenal captain and spend the whole of his career at the club. 

Wenger says in the book that Cole left due to a misunderstanding between his agent and the club. 

In an interview with www.the42.ie, Lawrence said: ‘When he left and went to Chelsea, there was a lot of bad feeling on Arsenal’s part and on his part. I don’t think he feels like he was treated well, and obviously Arsenal don’t feel as if they were treated well. It was like a very messy divorce.

‘You’d like to think with a bit of time, he could look back on that period and be proud of it. I’m not sure he’s ready to do that yet — he certainly wasn’t ready while he was a Chelsea player.

‘Perhaps in a few years’ time when his career is over and he has a bit more distance, maybe he can recognise what he achieved. I wouldn’t be convinced it’ll happen, but certainly the players spoke fondly of him and had a lot of affection for him as a person as well as a player. But there’s obviously still a bit of a problem there.’
