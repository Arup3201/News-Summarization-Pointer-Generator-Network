These are the faces of the seven young US Marines who were killed during a training exercise at a military base in Nevada.

The men, one of whom was just 19, died when an accidental mortar explosion sent shrapnel flying into troops at Hawthorne Army Depot.

All of the Marines killed on Monday night were based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where the tight-knit community has joined in mourning their loss.

Casualties: Lance Cpl Mason J. Vanderwork, 21 (left) and Cpl Aaron J. Ripperda, 26, were also named among the dead

Fallen: Lance Cpl Josh Taylor, left, and Roger 
Muchnick, were among the first to be named as victims in the training 
exercise accident on Monday night

Hundreds of residents in the rural 
community steeped in military history turned out to honor the fallen 
troops as investigators arrived to try to determine what happened.

Families with children clutching small 
American flags were among the nearly 300 people who attended the brief 
memorial service near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, today, where a 
trumpeter played taps at a city park as a giant U.S. flag flew at 
half-staff across the street from the base.

The victims of the blast whave been identified as Lance Cpl Josh Taylor, 21, of Marietta, Ohio; Roger Muchnick, 23, of Westport, Connecticut; Pfc Josh Martino, 19, of Dubois, Pennsylvania, Lance Cpl David P. Fenn II, 20, of Polk City, Pennsylvania, Lance Cpl. William T Wild IV, 21, of Anne Arundel, Maryland,  Lance Cpl Mason J. Vanderwork of Hickory, North Carolina and Cpl Aaron J. Ripperda, 26, of Madison, Illinois.

Living his dream: Pfc Josh Martino had wanted to be a Marine since he saw a TV special about the Marine Corps when he was a boy

Lance Cpl Taylor was engaged to be married, and had a wedding planned for May. His fiancee's father called him an exceptional person.

Keith Malone told The Marietta Times: 'You don't meet many young men like him today. He was respectful to everyone, very humble, just happy, happy all the time.'

Friend Christian Gentry added: 'You don't find people like him... Why would this happen to someone as great as Josh was? He had given so much into the Marines and [his] family.'

Taylor is also survived by three sisters and a brother.

Muchnick, who'd been in the Marines for about three years, had served in Afghanistan.

He played high school lacrosse and football in Westport, and later played lacrosse at Eastern Connecticut State University, where he studied business. He was considering a return to college after his enlistment.

In a biography on the university's website, Muchnick said the one thing he would like to do before he died was 'live,' and his most embarrassing moment was getting caught lip-synching in a school talent show.

His grandfather, Jerome Muchnick, said: 'He was at the top of his game when this happened. You can't imagine losing a very handsome, 23-year-old grandson who was vital and loving.'

Pfc Martino had aspired to be a Marine since he was a boy, when he saw a TV special on the Marine Corps.

His mother Karen Perry said: 'Since he was probably 8 years old, he wanted to be a Marine. That's all he wanted to do.'

Martino was a talkative former high school athlete and accomplished hunter who hoped to marry his fiancee later this year, Perry said.

His mother said she first heard a radio news report about the Monday accident, then three Marines arrived at her workplace to say her son was among the seven dead.

All three were based at Camp Lejeune.

Marine officers from the base, who arrived at the Hawthorne Army Depot on Tuesday, could not attend the memorial, as they began the task of figuring out what caused a mortar shell to explode in its firing tube.

The accident prompted the Pentagon to restrict the use of the weapons until an investigation can determine their safety, officials said.

The explosion on Monday night at the sprawling facility during an exercise involved the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune.

Seven men were killed and eight were injured, officials said.

A Navy corpsman is among the injured.

Hawthorne has been an important installation in American military history since World War II, when it was the staging area for ammunition, bombs and rockets.

Practice facility: The mortar blast occurred at the Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada, where members of the U.S. military conduct training

Area: The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles. It is located about 140 miles away from Reno

The facility has downsized in recent years but still serves as a munitions repository and disposal site, along with being a training facility for troops as they take advantage of terrain and climate similar to places like Afghanistan.

The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles, and bunkers dot the sagebrush-covered hills visible from the highway.

Even though the Marines were from the other side of the country, locals still feel a strong sense of pride in the military because the town's history is so deeply tied to the armed forces.

Following the accident, the Marines issued an 
indefinite moratorium on firing of all such mortars worldwide until an 
investigation clears as safe the type of weapon and ammunition in the 
tragedy.

A Marine 
Corps official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was not 
immediately clear whether the mortar exploded prematurely inside its 
firing tube or whether more than a single round exploded.

Location: The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles in Nevada. It is located about 135 miles from Reno

Preparedness: The military has called Hawthorne an ideal training facility for special forces

The
60mm mortar is a weapon that traditionally requires three to four 
Marines to operate, but it's common during training for others to 
observe nearby.

Maj Gen Raymond C. Fox said: 'We send our prayers and condolences to the families of Marines involved in this tragic incident.

'We
remain focused on ensuring that they are supported through this 
difficult time. We mourn their loss, and it is with heavy hearts we 
remember their courage and sacrifice.

The cause of the explosion is under investigation.

Hawthorne has held an important place
in American military history since World War II when it became the 
staging area for ammunition, bombs and rockets for the war.

The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection says that the depot employed more than 5,500 people at its peak.

The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles.

Nevada was chosen for the location 
because of its remoteness in the wake of a devastating explosion at the 
government's main depot in New Jersey in the 1920s.

It opened in September 1930 as the 
Naval Ammunition Depot Hawthorne, was redesignated Hawthorne Army 
Ammunition Plant in 1977 when it moved under the control of the Army, 
according to its website.

In 1994, the site ended its production mission and became Hawthorne Army Depot.

The
site currently serves several purposes for the military, including 
storing ammunition and explosives and providing what the military calls 
an ideal training facility for special forces preparing for deployments 
to similar desert terrain in places like Afghanistan.

It is one of the deadliest incidents to occur within a military facility in the U.S.

The
accident comes a week after a U.S. military plane assigned to a 
Washington state Naval Air Station crashed during a routine training 
flight, killing all three crew members on board.

In
February 2012, seven Marines were killed when a chopper went two 
military choppers collided in the Chocolate Mountains along the 
California-Arizona border.

Thirteen
service members were killed in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, when Army 
psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan opened fire on colleagues at the Texas 
base.

In March 2002, two training accidents over the course of few days totaled five deaths.

In
the first incident, a Navy HH-1 Huey chopper crashed into Split 
Mountain in the Sequoia National Forest. Two service members aboard the 
helicopter were killed and another four were injured.

A
mortar explosion was reported a day later at Fort Irwin in the Mojave 
Desert. Three soldiers from Kansas were killed in that accident.
