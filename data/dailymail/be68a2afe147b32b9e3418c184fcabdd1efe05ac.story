The FBI has now joined the search for missing Aisha Khan, the 19-year-old Kansas college student who disappeared shortly after leaving a frantic phone message saying an intoxicated stranger had assaulted her.

Local police have put in over 400 man hours since she disappeared midday Friday, and her family spoke out publicly about their despair at a police press conference yesterday.

Aisha got married in July and her 
husband Waseem was also at the press conference, making his first public
 appearance since his teen bride disappeared. He maintained that they 
had a happy marriage and the police chief said there is 'no reason to believe that he is a suspect'.

Frantic: In her voicemail, Aisha said she had never been so scared in her life after a stranger assaulter her shortly before she disappeared from a University of Kansas campus

Missing: Aisha Khan called her sister saying she had been assaulted by a man but was able to run away, but she was gone when her sister went to look

‘She was my wife, so I know her better, more than somebody else,’ Waseem said. ‘She’s happy with me.’

Aisha's mother Fozia also appeared, begging for her teenage daughter's safe return.

‘Whoever has my daughter, would please just bring her safe back home,’ said Aisha’s mother Fozia Khan.

'We'll forgive him we just want her safe back home,' she continued, assuming that she was kidnapped by a man though no suspect has been officially identified.

Husband: Waseem Khan said that he and Aisha had a happy marriage, and they postponed their honeymoon until after her exams

Aisha, who is studying for her finals at the University of Kansas, disappeared late Friday morning after she was allegedly assaulted on a secluded picnic table at the Edwards Campus in Overland Park

After running away from the man, she called her older sister Faiza and left a harrowing voicemail.

When her sister went to get her shortly after, all she found were her books and cell phone on Aisha’s favourite bench.

'My heart is like pounding.  I've never got this scared in my life.  Pick up your phones. I am freaking freaked out right now!'

'Oh my gosh it was so scary,' Aisha said in the message to Faiza.

Faiza listened to the message just minutes after it was left, and she tried calling Aisha back but she did not pick up her phone.

In the message, Aisha made it clear that she had slapped the man and run away. Reports differ as to whether she thought he smelt like alcohol or marijuana, but she was clear that he seemed intoxicated.

That did not provide much hope for Faiza after she drove to the spot where Aisha was studying at the Kansas University Edwards campus to find her sister's books and phone sitting on the table unattended.

Police have few new clues, but said that three construction workers saw a woman matching Aisha’s description walking off the campus by herself, but they could not confirm that it was her.

Desperate parents: Amanat and Fozia Khan were at the police press conference and were visibly upset as they asked for prayers from supporters

‘There's so much we don't know about the case,’ said Overland Park police chief John Douglass.

Frantic: In her voicemail, Aisha said she had never been so scared in her life

‘What we’re going to do is we’re going to act on this as if it were an abduction. We’re putting resources into it to deal with it accordingly. If it turns out otherwise, then so be it,’ Mr Douglass continued.

Four FBI agents have joined the 10 police detectives, 50 police officers, and University of Kansas  security guards are all looking for the teen.

The Kansas University campus does not have surveillance cameras, so that has not been helpful for police, but they have been canvassing the surrounding areas extensively.

Police on horseback have looked in nearby wooded areas, volunteers are passing out thousands of flyers, and investigators are looking over security footage of a gas station right next to the campus.

Aisha and Waseem live in the nearby 
neighborhood Olathe, and police have targeted Overland Park Municipal 
Golf Course, Quivira Park, and Stohl Memorial Park in their search.

'We
 have looked at videotapes of all the intersections. To date, we have 
seen absolutely nothing in that area,' Mr Douglass said.

A
 devout Muslim, Aisha’s disappearance has sparked an outpouring of 
support from Aisha’s family, friends, and the local Muslim community.

Her father Amanat also appeared and briefly spoke to press but was overwhelmed by emotion.

‘Please keep praying for us, we need help,’ he said fighting off tears.  

Her devastated family is offering a $10,000 reward for clues of her whereabouts.

‘She's 19 years old, but not much more than a child. One of our own is missing and we need to find her,’ Mr Douglass said.

Quiet spot: Aisha liked to study on this secluded picnic table, and this is where her sister found Aisha's books, cell phone and iPod

The campus: University of Kansas' Edward campus is in Overland Park, approximately 20 minutes south of Kansas City just near the boarder of Missouri

Sibling bonds: Aisha's sister Faiza and brother 
Imran Khan have both spoken out in hopes of increasing awareness about 
their missing sister Aisha. Faiza was the last one to see her when she 
dropped Aisha off
