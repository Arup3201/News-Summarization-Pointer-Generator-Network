Andy Murray seemed perfectly at ease on Wednesday as he peacefully practised at Wimbledon with his new team headed by Amelie Mauresmo – seemingly immune to the pressures of next week.

He did so having been boosted by confirmation that Wimbledon’s unique seeding formula had bumped him up from his ranking of fifth to third position in Friday’s draw, providing some kind of insulation.

This was guaranteed, leaving him to enjoy the day’s highlight of a 200 metre race at a nearby running track between his fitness coach Jez Green and Roger Rasheed, coach of Grigor Dimitrov. The whole team plus interested onlookers piled over to Wimbledon Park to see Rasheed win by a close head.

The atmosphere may be more serious 
come tomorrow morning when the draw was made, but at least Murray knows 
that he will not have to face his three main challengers – Novak 
Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer – until the semi-finals.

It
 means that Murray’s theoretical quarter final opponent would be one of 
Stan Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych, David Ferrer or Milos Raonic, yet it is 
all ifs and buts.

The 
mathematical formula, which rewards grass court performances of men from
 the previous two years, saw to his promotion, while relegating 
Australian Open champion  Wawrinka down to number five.

The
 Swiss, a first round loser in 2013, has reacted phlegmatically to the 
prospect, and in any case he has bigger concerns are being struck down 
by a heavy fever earlier this week.

When
 Wimbledon next year goes to having a three week gap between the French 
Open and SW19 it is likely to heighten debate about whether the formula 
is necessary at all in an era when baseliners can play perfectly well on
 the grass.

Already 
there is a fundamental inconsistency with the tournament reserving the 
right to alter the women’s seedings, something they did yesterday by 
inserting Serena and Venus Williams into the number eight slot in the 
doubles.

Another area 
under increasing debate is whether 32 seeds are needed, with many 
believing that it distorts competition and can make for an 
over-predictable first week, although that was emphatically not the case
 at Wimbledon twelve months ago.

The
 number of seeds was doubled in 2001 but many feel that it is time to go
 back to the old system of a privileged draw for only 16 players, when 
getting seeded was a notable career boast in itself.
