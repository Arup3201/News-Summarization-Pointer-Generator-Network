Chelsea will decide whether to send Izzy Brown out on loan after training on Monday.

Brown, 18, was a surprise name on the Chelsea subs' bench at the weekend for the 1-1 draw with Manchester City.

Chelsea want him to gain some experience but will only let him leave on loan for the right club.

Chelsea could let Izzy Brown leave the club on loan for the rest of the season

Burnley are interested in taking the striker for the rest of the season especially with uncertainty continuing over the future of Liverpool target Danny Ings.

Burnley are in the market for more firepower and are believed to be looking at Stamford Bridge as a likely source for reinforcements.

The striker was signed from West Brom in 2013 and made his Premier League debut for the Baggies on the final day of that season.

Uncertainty surrounds the future of Burnley's Danny Ings 

In October 2014, Brown made the Chelsea bench for the first time in a competitive fixture, but was an unused substitute as Chelsea beat Shrewsbury Town 2–1 in the League Cup.

The striker is also an England U19 international and scored two goals in as many appearances for the Young Lions.
