Cities across the country are turning to green as they take part in annual St. Patrick's Day parades. 

The day itself is not until Tuesday - but many cities have already held parades, with attendees decked out in green to celebrate. 

In the northeast, Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade included two gay and lesbian groups for the first time on Sunday.

Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade made history Sunday as two gay and lesbian groups marched after decades of opposition that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The gay military veterans service group OutVets and gay rights group Boston Pride joined the annual celebration of military veterans and Irish heritage at the invitation of the sponsoring South Boston Allied War Veterans Council.

The Allied War Council's current leaders voted 5-4 in December to welcome OutVets as one of about 100 groups in this year's parade. Boston Pride said it also received an acceptance letter this week.

Boston's mayors had boycotted the event since 1995, when the council took its fight to exclude gay groups to the U.S. Supreme Court and won on First Amendment grounds.

First-term U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine, marched with OutVets.

'I believe gay rights is the civil rights fight of our generation and this is a small, but important, step in the steady march toward freedom and justice,' he said.

Some Roman Catholic groups declined to march, including the state Knights of Columbus, saying they felt this year's parade had been politicized.

Police were preparing for the festivities, with forces around the country putting on extra officers and increasing DUI checkpoints.

WTNH reported that the parade on Sunday in New Haven, Connecticut was predicted to bring in more than 300,000 attendees. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania also held a parade on Sunday.
