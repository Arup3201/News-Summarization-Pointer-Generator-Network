Convicted rapist Ched Evans is engaged to his girlfriend just two weeks after he was released from prison, it emerged today.

The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire earlier this month after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his hometown of Rhyl, Wales.

He has now proposed to fiancée Natasha Massey, who has led the campaign against his conviction, it was reported today.

Ched Evans is to marry his fiancée Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl

Ms Massey, who has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of the crime, was seen wearing a ring in a recent video the footballer made in which he claimed he was only guilty of infidelity

Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. 

In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'.

He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it.

'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong.

'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful.

'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.'

Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring in the video, but it is now believed to have been a 'commitment ring' Evans gave her while he was in prison.

The Sun reported this morning that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed.

A source told the paper Ms Massey was 'over the moon' and 'smiling from ear to ear'.

Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. 

Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive.

'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose.

'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.'

She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him.

‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time.

‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’

Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month

Evans's own family have criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim.

She said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’

His victim's father has also spoken out, demanding an apology from the footballer.

He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found.

‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.'

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.
