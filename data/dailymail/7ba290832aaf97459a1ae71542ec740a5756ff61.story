Denise Rich, the wealthy socialite and former wife of late billionaire trader Marc Rich, threw a lavish carnival-themed party in a St Tropez harbor last night with guests including Joan Collins, Magic Johnson and Ivana Trump.

The 68-year-old renounced her U.S. citizenship last year, saving herself millions in tax dollars, some of which seems to have been pumped into the lavish, ostentatious party on her 157-foot yacht Lady Joy.

She has an estimated fortune of $12million.

Also at the party were Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn, TV personality Star Jones, model Jerry Hall and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman.

Wooo: Denise Rich smiles during her annual St Tropez party on July 17, 2013, in Saint-Tropez, France, where she danced with Joan Collins, Magic Johnson and Ivana trump

A source told the New York Post: 'The entire dock is covered in red carpet. Huge stars are hanging like balloons. Women are doing circus acts above the dance floor, which is rotating in a circle with a big top over it'

Having a ball: Joan and Terry were also seen with Denise Rich and Ivana Trump

A source told the New York Post: 'The entire dock is covered in red carpet. Huge stars are hanging like 
balloons. Women are doing circus acts above the dance floor, which is 
rotating in a circle with a big top over it. Oh, yes.'

The Grammy-nominated songwriter appeared in the  Federal Register on April 30, 2012, in a 
quarterly list of Americans who renounced their U.S. citizenship and 
permanent residents who handed in their green cards.

Her ex-husband Marc Rich died in Switzerland aged 78 at the end of June.

He made his fortune by founding the company which would become Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, but was more famous for fleeing from the U.S. in 1983 when he was indicted on more than 50 counts of fraud, racketeering and tax evasion.

The charges could have earned Rich 300 years in prison - however, in 2001 Clinton decided to pardon him hours before leaving office, leading to speculation he was motivated by receiving thousands of dollars in donations from the financier's ex-wife Denise.

Rich, who was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, has Austrian citizenship through her
deceased father. her lawyer said she dumped her U.S. 
passport 'so that she can be closer to her family and to Peter Cervinka,
her long-time partner'.

The 68-year-old wrote songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson, is the latest bold-faced name to join a wave of wealthy people renouncing their American citizenship.

Rich's two daughters live in London; 
Cervinka, a wealthy property developer, is an Austrian national.

Dubbed 'Lady Gatsby' by Yachting 
magazine, she owns multiple properties, including a mansion in Aspen, 
Colorado and is a frequent habitue of Cannes, Monte Carlo and St 
Tropez.

Last year Rich sold her massive, 12,000 square foot Fifth Avenue duplex penthouse to Hollywood mogul David Geffen for $54million at the end of 2012.
