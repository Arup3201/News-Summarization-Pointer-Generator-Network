Police in North Carolina described the living conditions at the home where an 11-year-old boy was found handcuffed by his ankles to a post with a dead chicken around his neck as 'an environment you wouldn't want to walk through, much less live in.'

As the 11-year-old and four other children aged between eight and 14-years-old were removed from the home of foster parents Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper, Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said that the couple would also handcuff the children overnight to a three-foot piece of railroad to stop them running away.

With Larson and Harper currently in jail on a bond or more than one million dollars, Cathey said the home had an overwhelming smell of urine and feces, no running water and revealed all the children slept on the floor in one room, 'As bad as you think that house was on the outside, that's probably the cleanest part of that place,' according to WCNC.

Shocking conditions: Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested Friday after a sheriff's deputy found the shivering 11-year-old boy

Wanda Sue Larson, a supervisor with the Union County Department of Social Services, and Dorian Lee Harper, an emergency room nurse at CMC-Union in Monroe, face charges of intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals.

'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said to MyFox8.com.Â 

'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water.'

The conditions at the property shocked authorities who found dozens of chickens, turkeys, geese, two llamas and a horse roaming around the ramshackle home which was littered with junk.

Cathey said that the smell inside the home took his breath away and that the children lived among dogs and feces.

All the children appeared to suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was to buy them pizza.

Wanda Sue Larson, 57, was arrested and charged with child abuse and false imprisonment on Friday after a deputy found the boy shivering and handcuffed by his ankle to the front porch, the Union County, North Carolina sheriff's office said.

Larson, a supervisor at the county's Child Protective Services office, was not home when the child was discovered but is accused of being complicit in the mistreatment, according to sheriff's officials.

Authorities also arrested Dorian Lee Harper, 57, who along with Larson was serving as a foster parent to the child. The couple has four adopted children in addition to the foster child.

A deputy was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property when he saw the child handcuffed to the porch.

He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch.

According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house.

Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. The children were removed from the home and are in the care of protective services outside of Union County.

'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday.

'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'

Both Larson and Harper were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals due to the condition of some of their pets.

It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation.

Larson and Harper remained jailed on Saturday. They each face charges of intentional child abuse that inflicted serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals, with the latter allegation based on the condition of some of the family pets, the sheriff's office said.

Larson also is charged with willful failure to discharge her duty as a public official and both are due in court on Monday.
