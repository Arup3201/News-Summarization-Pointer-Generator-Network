Kell Brook pulled off a stunning upset to dethrone Shawn Porter and win the IBF welterweight world title on Saturday night.

The Sheffield star recovered from a slow start in Los Angeles to gradually impose himself on the unbeaten champion.

One judge scored the fight level but the other two marked it in Brook's favour, albeit by flattering margins of 117-111 and 116-112.

Porter, who had won the title from Devon Alexander last year, was relentless in the first half of the fight as he forced his opponent back.

A cut opened up above Brook's left eye as early as the second round but it was clear from the initial exchanges that the Brit was landing the cleaner shots.

In the face of the champion's smothering tactics however, Brook was unable to put his combinations together as Porter took advantage of a weak referee to lead with his head.

But by the halfway stage, the 26-year-old from Ohio began to tire and a second clash of heads left him too cut above his eye.

Brook, who saw three title fights with then champion Alexander cancelled through injury in 2013, began to impose himself as Porter struggled to display the power that stopped Paulie Malignaggi in brutal fashion four months ago.

And when the final bell rang, the champion looked a beaten man as Brook and his small band of supporters celebrated.

After British judge Dave Parris scored the bout a draw, Brook faced a nervous wait before the other two scores were revealed. 

Brook becomes just the sixth Brit to win a world title in the welterweight division after Matt Wells, Lloyd Honeyghan, John H Stracey and Ricky Hatton.

The 28-year-old can now look forward to a series of money-spinning fights including a potential battle of Britain with bitter rival Amir Khan. 

Eyeing up the prize: Brook has also talked up the possibility of stepping into the ring with Floyd Mayweather Jr

'Since I was nine years old, I've been training to be a champion,' said Brook. 'I looked scrappy, but I did what I had to do.

'I dealt with business, It's an unbelievable feeling, and I can't get my head around it.

'You're going to see me in some mega fights now. I'm the champion; Keith Thurman and Floyd Mayweather will be watching this. Amir Khan can get in the queue.'
