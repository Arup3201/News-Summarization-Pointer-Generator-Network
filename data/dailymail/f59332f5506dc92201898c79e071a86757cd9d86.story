A multi-coloured footbridge has been built over a canal bed - and it's made out of giant-sized pieces of Meccano.

The six-ton steel bridge in the Little Lever area of Bolton cost £90,000 to construct, using 400 pieces of oversized Meccano and 700 nuts and bolts.

It is hoped that the project will kickstart a regeneration of the historic stretch of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal at Nob End.

Old-fashioned fun: The completed bridge now stands 1.3 metres high and spans 6.4m across the canal in Little Lever to Moses Gate Country Park

Colourful story: Artist Liam Curtin said he wanted to reflect Bolton's engineering heritage

Splash of colour: The bridge is 1.3 metres high and 6.4m across. The council praised its distinctiveness

The bridge built at the spot in 1796 was a wooden construction used by horses, but it collapsed around 50 years ago.

Earlier this year, a developer gave Bolton Council money for the building project, an agreement that was part of
its planning application to build houses in Little Lever.

The council commissioned public artist Liam Curtin, from Fallowfield, to work on a public installation.

'We tried out a few smaller projects in the area, such as floating structures like a boat made of CDs, created by local people,' he told MailOnline.

'We then turned towards canal and had a different site, but the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Society talked me into looking at the site where the bridge now is.

Nuts and bolts: The fact that the pieces could be assembled on site meant lots of people could be involved

'Distinctive': The nuts, bolts and component parts were made in two Bolton factories

Play time! A local steel fabricator made the beams, nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set - but 10 times thicker and 1,000 times heavier

'They thought having it there would allow them to develop the rest of the canal, and have a footpath going into Moses Gate Country Park.

'Paul Hindle, leader of the society, took me on a tour of a vandalised bridge and a new, very robust but slightly ugly bridge nearby. It made me want to make the design stronger, and yet reflect Bolton's heritage as town of engineering

Meccano is a model construction system comprising re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces.

It was invented in 1901 in Liverpool by Frank Hornby and manufactured by the British company, Meccano Ltd, between 1908 and 1980.

It was an educational toy for children, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing.

It is now manufactured in France and China.

'Meccano is, in a sense, scaled down engineering and all we were doing was scaling it up.

'It's intriguing because of the Meccano element, and it was funny going back to it - we even modelled it with Meccano.

'We also had something we could assemble on site, meaning lots of people could be involved.

'A Meccano society came to visit it and they were impressed with its authenticity.'

The completed bridge now stands 1.3 metres high and spans 6.4m across the canal in Little Lever to Moses Gate Country Park.

Here, the canal branches into three, at a famous site important to the history of canal building, dating back to the 1790s.

Local steel fabricators made the beams, nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set — but ten times thicker and 1,000 times heavier.

Each piece cost around £55 to produce and each bolt around £18.

The bridge uses traditional 1950s Meccano colours, and local people volunteered to help with the building.

Mr Curtin added: 'Building a bridge from giant Meccano is the fulfilment of a childhood dream. I spent my entire childhood building mechanical devices from Meccano.

'It wasn’t until I actually saw the finished pieces arriving from the factory that I realised we had created something quite wonderful.

'As members of the canal society unpacked the lorry, they appeared like Lilliputian figures in a magical toy world.

'I am so grateful to everyone involved. The engineers at Bolton Council have been creative and inventive and given us something which is structurally sound without compromising the artwork. The local residents and canal society members have been working tirelessly.'

Bright idea: The scaled-up building pieces make people 'look like Lilliputian figures in a magical toy world', according to the artist

The council’s cabinet member for environment, Councillor Nick Peel, hailed it as a ‘distinctive landmark’.

He said: 'Being from the local area myself I know that the bridge will really benefit local people and I hope they make good use of it.'

It was originally described as having an 'exaggerated toy-like detail'.

Marie McNulty, Bolton at Home’s east neighbourhood manager, said: 'Local residents have been overwhelmingly supportive of this idea, which we believe would make a positive difference to the area as both a functional and decorative feature.'

The canal society is also carrying out 
improvements around the Nob End section of the canal and is planning to 
create a picnic area.

Society members hope it will form part of their long-term aspirations to create a visitor centre and re-open the waterway.

They plan to remove the in-fill at the nearest road bridge and put in a dam so that water can flow down the stretch of canal again and under the Meccano bridge.
