Citing a personal matter, Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington abruptly resigned from the team earlier today. 

His resignation took effect immediately, with bench coach Tim Bogar stepping up as interim manager for the remainder of the season

Washington, 62, had previously tested positive for cocaine during the 2009 season, and been subjected to random drug testing ever since, with then-team president Nolan Ryan deciding to keep him on as manager, even as he offered to leave the team.

Resigned: Ron Washington released a statement today announcing he would be stepping down as manager of the Texas Rangers, citing a 'personal matter'

General manager Jon Daniels told ESPN that Washington's resignation is 'not drug-related.'  

'I have submitted my resignation from the job I love - managing the Rangers - in order to devote my full attention to addressing an off-the-field personal matter,' Washington said in a statement. 

'As painful as it is, stepping away from the game is what's best for me and my family.'

He then added, 'This is in no way related to the disappointing performance of the team this season.'

Last place: The Rangers have a record of 53-87 this season, and were the first MLB team officially eliminated from making the playoffs

The Rangers, in the midst of a six-game losing streak, are the first major league team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention this year, and have a record of 53-87 with 22 games left to play in the season.

Washington had been the Rangers manager since the start of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, and led the team to World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011.

Prior to joining the Rangers, Washington spent 11 seasons as an assistant coach with the Oakland Athletics.

He went 664-611 with the Rangers, earning more wins than any manager in club history. He also enjoyed four consecutive 90-win seasons, three playoff appearances, and back-to-back American League championships. 

The Rangers were 18-16 in Washington's three postseason appearances. 

Success: Washington coached the Rangers to appearances in two World Series, in 2010 and 2011

'He has left his mark as a teacher, motivator, and leader on this organization,' said Daniels. 

'We wish Ron the best as he deals with this matter.'
