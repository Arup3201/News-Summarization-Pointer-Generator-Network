A Romanian scrap yard worker has provoked fury by claiming it is his 'right' to move his family to Britain so he can claim up to £25,000 of benefits.

Father-of-five Nicu Popescu, 30, moved to Birmingham from Bucharest two years ago and says he now plans to bring over his wife and children in order to top up his low income and take advantage of its easy handouts.

His plans have been widely condemned by MPs as an 'abuse' of Britain's weak benefits system and an example of why immigration routes should be tightened.

Mr Popescu said the benefits in Britain were significantly better than Romania and he hoped his family would be given a three or four bedroom house once they arrived, the Daily Express reported.

'In Romania the healthcare is very bad and here they offer you free treatment. It will be a dream new start for my family.

'It's my right to claim benefits.'

His unashamed plans to take advantage of the country's soft benefits system provoked outrage as commentators claim Britain has become a 'holy grail' for immigrants because of its generous handouts.

Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the Popescu family's attitude epitomised Eastern European attitudes towards Britain and showed how its system was open to abuse.

Many are waiting to see what effect a landmark European Court ruling will have on preventing benefit tourism.

Five days ago European judges gave Britain the green light to block welfare claims from European Union nationals - stating jobless migrants cannout move around the continent living off state handouts and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves.

There were 38,580 migrants from the EU claiming Jobseekers Allowance in the UK in February this year

The decision was ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers.

It is believed the ruling will provide a basis in European law that can reinforce reform attempts in Britain.

David Cameron has heralded the ruling.

He said: 'This is good news and a step in the right direction. The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right. There should be rules about restricting benefits.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the UK who don’t have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become a unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems.

‘The case underlines that free movement is not an unqualified right and will have a major impact on the way the Commission interprets law in future.’

EU migrants who come to Britain are banned from claiming jobseekers’ allowance for the first three months they are here. For the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim, if they can prove they are actively looking for work – although this is to be reduced to three months.

After that, they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits. In January, ministers announced they were banning jobless migrants from claiming housing benefit.
