From Botox and lasers to Kim Kardashian's favourite vampire facelifts, it 
seems that we have entered a new era in the 
fight against wrinkles.

But the
 latest addition to the litany of unusual lotions and potions about to take the beauty world by storm really could be described as out of this world.

Renowned Harley Street plastic surgeon Dr Yannis Alexandrides has developed a range of products  in collaboration with two space 
scientists who worked on the Soviet Space Program, responsible for a number of pioneering accomplishments in space flight over 63 years.

Galactic: Dr Yannis Alexandrides has developed a range of products, called 111Skin (left) in collaboration with two space scientists who had previously worked on the Soviet Space Program. The range claims to help maintain youthful skin

The formulations were originally created because astronauts reported skin problems such as thinning, dryness, increased sensitivity and delayed healing.

Once 
the program had been dissolved, the scientists kept hold of their 
patented formula, which they had supplied to astronauts to protect their 
skin while in orbit.

This formula is NAC Y² (a combination of NAC, 
Vitamin C and Escin) which increases Glutathione - the most vital 
antioxidant in our cells for maintaining youthful skin.

NAC and Vitamin C
 are essential for stimulating Glutathione which decreases during the 
body’s ageing process.

Escin, meanwhile, is a potent antioxidant that promises to increase 
blood circulation, promote stronger collagen production, and help 
transport NAC and Vitamin C directly to the cells.

Potent: The formula in each product is NAC Y² (a combination of NAC, Vitamin C and Escin) which increases Glutathione - the most vital antioxidant in our cells for maintaining youthful skin

Together, these 
ingredients claim to detoxify, hydrate and regenerate skin cells, working from 
within to strengthen the skin and fight damage.

Each
 111SKIN product, sold in Harrods and costing between £40-£190, contains the patented NAC Y2 formula.

This potent 
antioxidant has been taken by astronauts in supplement form when in 
space for 25 years and is proven in NASA research to delay ageing and stimulate the body’s natural repair 
system. 

One such product in the range, the £117 Space Anti Age NAC Y2 - Facelift Day Cream, claims to heal skin whilst preventing scarring.

One of the hero products from the range is the 111 SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream - a potent anti-ageing concoction using rare diamond dust particles.

The galactic cream doesn't come cheap. Beauty aficionados desperate to turn back 
the clock must pay a staggering £599 for 50ml.

111 SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream claims to penetrate the deeper 
layers of skin in order to transport potent youth restoring ingredients 
including NAC Y2 formula, Collagen type I and III and Hyaluronic acid.

Out of this world: The £599 111 SKIN Celestial 
Black Diamond Cream contains diamond particles from space and was 
developed with the help of NASA scientists
