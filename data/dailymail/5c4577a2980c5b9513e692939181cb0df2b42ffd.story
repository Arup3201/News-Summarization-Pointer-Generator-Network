Her husband was defeated by him in the 1992 presidential election, however Barbara Bush holds Bill Clinton in high esteem.

Mrs Bush, 88 proclaimed her love for the former president as she revealed that Clinton sees Bush Snr as ‘the father he never had’.

'I love Bill Clinton': Barbara Bush revealed that former president Bill Clinton sees George Bush Snr as 'the father he never had'

‘I love Bill Clinton,’ Mrs Bush told C-SPAN. ‘Maybe not his politics, but I love Bill Clinton.

‘Bill visits us every summer. We don’t agree politically, but we don't talk politics.’

Allegedly referring to each other as ‘41’ and ‘42’, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush grew close in the years after the 1992 election, particularly after the former left office and the pair began working together on charity efforts.

‘You cannot get mad at the guy,' Bush wrote in a letter to a journalist friend following the pair's mutual relief campaign in the wake of the 2005 South-East Asia tsunami, later published in All The Best, George Bush; My Life in Letters and other Writings.

'I admit to wondering why he can't stay on time, but when I see him interacting with folks my wonder turns to understanding, with a dollop of angst thrown in.

‘Clinton is a fascinating character. He has opinions on everything - no matter what. He seems to have a great grasp of history's events and people.'

Bill Clinton’s father died in a car accident three months before he was born, and Barbara Bush says her husband has somewhat filled that gap.

‘Bill's father wasn’t around, and I think he thinks of George a little bit like the father he didn't have,’ the former first lady said of Clinton.

Mrs Bush speaks in the interview about how her husband has become a father figure for Bill Clinton, something echoed by his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton.

‘Barbara Bush has even started referring to Bill as her adopted son, sometimes as the adopted black sheep son.

'I don't know how Jeb and his siblings feel, but I know Bill loves it because of his great admiration and affection for 41 and all that they have done together,’ Hilary Clinton said in a speech at the National Constitution Center last year.

The interview with Barbara Bush is part of C-SPAN's series on first ladies.
