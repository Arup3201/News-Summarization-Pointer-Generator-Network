This is the moment a young man walking past a building site narrowly escaped death when a careless worker dislodged a 17lb block of concrete from 26ft up.

A split second after he stepped around a workman moving a barrier, the missile  fell, missing his head by a few inches in a stroke of good fortune that almost certainly saved his life. 

With lady luck on his side, the 29-year-old pedestrian was struck a glancing blow on his right shoulder and knocked to the pavement.

Cheating death: The 14lb stone falls from a height of 26 feet towards the unsuspecting pedestrian

The man, who does not want to be 
named, suffered cuts, bruises and muscle spasms as a result of the 
accident. The mental scars may take a lot longer to heal. 

A health and safety executive 
investigation found that a cherry picker was being used overhead to 
clean stonework and install anti-pigeon spikes.

When it was moved, it struck the building and dislodged the block.

There were no barriers erected underneath the work in Camberley, Surrey, when the rubble fell on the busy high street.

Portsmouth-based Majestic 
Construction told Guildford Magistrates’ Court that the barriers were 
being moved to provide a safe working area where the cherry picker was 
heading.

Luck escape: Amazingly, the falling masonry missed his head by inches and hit him on the shoulder

But none of its workers thought to warn pedestrians of the potential danger.

The company was fined £8,000 and ordered to pay £5,473 costs.

It pleaded guilty to a single breach 
of the Work at Height Regulations 2005. After the hearing, HSE inspector
Andrew Cousins said the incident last May could have been  easily 
avoided. 

‘This was an entirely preventable 
incident that resulted in a large chunk of masonry being knocked on to 
an entirely innocent pedestrian,’ he said. 

‘It is pure luck that it missed his head, otherwise he could well have been killed.

Safety breach: The high street in Camberley, Surrey, where the 29-year-old cheated death

‘Simply fencing off the area beneath the works and providing an alternative route around it is all that was necessary.

‘Where people are working overhead in a public area they must exclude the public from the work area wherever possible.

Public safety needs to be managed in exactly the same way as that of those undertaking the work, and not just left to chance.’

Majestic Construction declined to comment because of a claim relating to the incident.

But in its promotional material it 
says: ‘We pride ourselves on exceptional customer service and 
workmanship. With attention to detail and commitment to our clients, you
won’t be disappointed.’
