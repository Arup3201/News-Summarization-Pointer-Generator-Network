Andrew Silverman, the real estate mogul whose socialite wife Lauren is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby, co-owns a hotel in Panama that is known for prostitution, it emerged today.

Silverman's company took over the Veneto hotel - which one travel website claims has been a 'Panama sex destination for decades' - in 2007 for $90 million.

The revelations come as sources close to Silverman's estranged wife told MailOnline that he is 'no angel' - even though friends have tried to paint him as an injured, innocent party.

A website named the Panama Sex Guide Web says: 'If you're a rookie, the Veneto is the place to start your journey in to Panama City's night scene.'

It explains that as many as 30 girls will be working the casino on any given evening and will take up to $350 for a night 'depending on the talent level you desire'.

'If you find what you are looking for, you can take them up to your room with no questions asked and no need to leave the hotel,' it adds.

Travel site The Panama Report added that the Veneto's 'resident hookers are fun to an extent: They're like a wild zebra which the safari-going vacationers find exotic and untamed,' the New York Post reported.

Lavish: The hotel, in Panama City, has 327 bedrooms, four restaurants and two bars

'On the prowl': Some online reviewers said scores of prostitutes looked for business in the casino of the hotel

And a recent recent review on TripAdvisor warned that the hotel, which has 327 rooms, four restaurants and two bars, is 'not great for family visits' due to the prostitutes.

Another reviewer last month said that the casino is full of as many as 100 prostitutes a night.

'Very easy to identify these women who are mostly well dressed with straight hair and with breast and buttock implants,' the reviewer wrote.

The hotel manager responded to the review: 'I want to... let you know that we do not encourage prostitution, however it is legal in Panama.'

A hotel source added that all profits from the hotel go to building schools throughout the country.

And today a family source hit back at the accusations over the casino, telling MailOnline: 'The casino is highly regulated like all others in Panama and is open to the public, just like all the major properties in Las Vegas.

'This is a desperate attempt to try and change the subject from Lauren's infidelity and to smear her husband, who has refrained from attacking her because he places a greater priority on protecting his son than further embarrassing the son's mother.'

Above board: Hotel staff noted that prostitution is not illegal in Panama but that they did not encourage it

Interior: Other websites said that customers could take prostitutes to their rooms with no questions asked

The revelations come after friends 
have tried to claim the moral high ground on Andrew's behalf, painting 
him as the innocent party while his wife struck up a relationship with 
his friend Simon Cowell.

But sources close to his estranged wife Lauren have said he is 'no angel'.

One family source in Florida told MailOnline: 'People will think that Andrew is the totally innocent party in all this.

'But
if this divorce gets ugly, then it won't be one-sided, Lauren knows 
everything about Andrew - and believe me, he's no angel.'

Another source added: 'He has been known to say to friends, "Let's go away and get some girls," presumably to his place in Panama,' the Post reported.

He also asked the husbands of Lauren's friends to party with him in Las Vegas, a source said.

But another friend of the couple added: 'A bunch of guys going away for the weekend is pretty normal behavior... Itâ€™s sad to see someone desperately trying to smear Andrew.'

The couple, who have been married for ten years, are now going through a divorce and have said that their seven-year-old son is the priority. Andrew is said to be looking for sole custody of the boy.
