Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan used 'relatively sophisticated' bombs with fuses made from Christmas lights and remote-control detonators made from model car parts.

In a federal court filing on Wednesday in Boston, prosecutors also revealed that while the suspect hid from police in a boat, he wrote a note saying how he was jealous of his brother Tamerlan, who died after a gun battle with the authorities after the bombing.

Tsarnaev hid in the boat parked on the driveway of a house in Watertown, Massachusetts, where he had been shot and bleeding, trying to evade police after the bombings.

In the note, wrote in pencil, Tsarnaev said that his brother had gone to the 'garden of paradise' and asked Allah to make a martyr of him, reported USA Today.

He also wrote that the U.S. government was 'killing innocent civilians' and that he couldn't stand to see 'such evil go unpunished'.

He also warns that America is 'fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, so how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.'

The federal court filing was made in response to a motion from Tsarnaev's defense
 team to supress the note and statements he made to FBI agents during his emergency 
treatment shortly after his arrest last year because he had no lawyer 
present.

In the filing, prosecutors said that FBI
 agents needed to question Tsarnaev at the time because they had to 
determine exactly how the brothers had constructed their explosives and 
whether they had any accomplices who may have posed a threat.

'The Marathon bombs were constructed using improvised fuses made from Christmas lights and improvised, remote-control detonators fashioned from model car parts,' prosecutors wrote.

'These relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the Tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others.'

Prosecutors also revealed that Dzhokahar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev crushed and emptied fireworks of their gunpowder to make the detonators for their bombs.

Gunpowder is so fine that it would be expected to leave traces on their bodies and where they worked.

However, 'searches of the Tsarnaev's residences, three vehicles, and other locations associated with them yielded virtually no traces of black powder, again strongly suggesting that others had built, or at least helped the Tsarnaev's build the bombs and thus, might have built more,' wrote prosecutors.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's legal team had not responded on Wednesday to the legal filing as the preparations for November's trial gather pace.

The 20-year-old terror suspect ran over and killed his own brother last year in a confrontation with police just days after the April 15, bombings which killed three and injured hundreds.

The younger Tsarnaev is facing federal charges that could result in the death penalty for his role in the deadly terror attack.

The brother's also shot dead an MIT police officer before they unleashed a trail of destruction across Boston as they battled police with bombs and automatic weapons in Watertown.

Despite the assertions of the prosecution, no one else has ever been charged in connection with the bombings.

'In short, the facts and circumstances known to law enforcement at the time they interviewed Tsarnaev provided ample reason to believe that the Tsarnaevs did not act alone,' prosecutors wrote on Wednesday.

They also wrote that the government had reason to believe that 'others might have radicalized them, directed them, trained them, assisted them, and/or concealed them; and that these others might be planning or poised to carry out additional attacks.

'Finding out if there were other bombs, other bombers, or others plotting similar and coordinated attacks was a public safety matter of the utmost urgency.'

This month, lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev argued that the statements 
he made to authorities after he was arrested should be thrown out 
because he was questioned for 36 hours in a hospital room while 
suffering from gunshot wounds and without being told his rights.

The lawyers said in a flurry of pre-trial court filings that federal 
agents began questioning Tsarnaev about 20 hours after he arrived at the
 hospital in critical condition and his statements can't be considered 
voluntary.

Federal investigators questioned him days after last year's deadly 
bombing without formally telling him of his right to a lawyer under a 
public safety exception allowed when there's concern about an ongoing 
threat.

But defense attorneys said the questioning continued 'despite 
the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threat to
 public safety, repeatedly asked for a lawyer, and begged to rest.'

They
 said his treatment included painkillers that impaired his judgment and 
increased his susceptibility to pressure.
