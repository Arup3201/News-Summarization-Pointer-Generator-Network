A couple who spent $35,000 building a tiny house-on-wheels to live an eco-friendly life were stunned to find their home-to-be had been towed away by thieves.

Casey Friday and his wife Jessica spent two and a half years building the house themselves from the raw materials so they could reduce their environmental impact.

The 650sq ft home, which can be attached to a car and moved like a trailer, could run on rainwater, compost its waste and get by on 'very little' electricity - but was purloined from its custom-paved driveway in Spring Branch, Texas.

The theft on December 20, which drove the couple to despair, led the two to think that their efforts and money was wasted.

But after the story featured on the local news, San Antonio residents tipped police off that the diminutive dwelling had cropped up on the other side of town.

Sheriff's deputies were able to return the home last week, which is now being kept in an impound lot while the Caseys decide what to do with it next, according to NBC4 San Antonio.

Rage: Friday reacted angrily to the theft of the home, which had been finished for less than a month when it was taken

Painstaking: Friday and his wife built the whole house themselves from the raw materials

He told the station the theft was 'depressing, devastating, made me angry and shocked all at the same time.'

In a blog-post after the crime, he said: 'Our house had not even been on the property for a month, and some f*****g a**-clown decided to steal it, like it was his all along.'

'We probably put in about $35,000 into parts alone on the house. Clearing the (now destroyed) land and adding a paver “driveway” for my car cost us $3,100.

Unsure: The Fridays are waiting to decide what to do with the home now as they no longer want to live in it

'You can see how they destroyed it while stealing the house. I worked on this house for 2.5 years, while building up my businesses. The resale value on this highly custom house would easily be $55-60,000.'

The couple has said they may now sell off the house as the theft has blighted their plans to live in it, and they have already signed up for an apartment.

Officials at the Bexar County Sheriff's office told NBC4 that they were not certain who stole the house - and that the people responsible will face charges.
