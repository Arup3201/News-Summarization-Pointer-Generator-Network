Newcastle have taken a swipe at exiled loanee Hatem Ben Arfa via their matchday programme – and he will again be forced to train with the reserves should Hull, as expected, send him back to St James’ Park next month.

Alan Pardew will not allow the French winger, whom he chose to get rid of during the summer after becoming disillusioned with his ‘lack of professionalism’, to disrupt the team spirit he has harnessed on Tyneside this season.

And Newcastle’s programme was quick to remind supporters of Ben Arfa’s current struggle for form with a page detailing his ‘torrid’ performance at Manchester United, during which he was substituted before half-time.

So far, Pardew and the club have preferred not to mention the 27-year-old and the boss was a little miffed at one press conference when – amid United’s six-match winning run - a French journalist repeatedly asked questions about Ben Arfa, forcing Newcastle’s press officer to intervene.

But the programme previewing Saturday’s 2-1 win over Chelsea made a point of highlighting Ben Arfa's poor display at Old Trafford.

Using a big picture of the player for the first time, they wrote: ‘Hatem Ben Arfa lasted just 35 minutes of Hull City’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester United last Saturday before being replaced by Sone Aluko.

‘The French winger endured a torrid opening half hour at the hands of Louis van Gaal’s United before Tigers boss Steve Bruce made the change.’ 

Bruce has since been forced to deny that there was a fall-out with Ben Arfa. 

Sportsmail, however, understands the Hull boss has lost patience with his deadline-day signing, who has failed to score in eight appearances and has been left out of the last two matchday squads.

The player’s work-rate is thought to be a major concern among the management team at the KC Stadium.

Bruce, whose side have slipped into the bottom three after a run of eight without a victory, said: ‘There is no disputing that he has got ability but ability isn’t enough at this level, so he will be training like everyone else will be training.

‘We have now got four or five weeks until January and we could lose three or four players next week and then there is a chance that he might be back in.

‘We will see what December and January brings and have a sit down and see where we all are.’ 

Ben Arfa, via his Instagram account, says there is no rift with Bruce: ‘I just wanted to clarify my situation,’ he wrote.

‘I have no problem with my coach (Bruce). This is someone that I love that I respect and I admire!’ 

Ben Arfa’s contract at Newcastle is up at the end of the season and, should he return to the club in January, it is thought they will allow him to leave on loan for the remainder of his deal.
