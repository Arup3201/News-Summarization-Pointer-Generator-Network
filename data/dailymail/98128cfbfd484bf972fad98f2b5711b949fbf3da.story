Fans of The Simpsons and Family Guy have been given a first look at the hotly anticipated crossover episode after a teaser was released at the Comic Con festival.

The one-hour Fox special – titled The Simpsons Guy – sees the Griffin family journey to Springfield from their Quahog home to bond with Homer and co.

But the teaser begins with a distinctly unimpressed Peter Griffin revealing his scepticism with their new environment.

As they walk through the town, he warns 
his family: 'Don’t drink the water around here... everyone around here 
looks like they have hepatitis.'

Bonding: Bart gives Stewie and Brian an example of his trademark prank call to Moe's tavern  

Relations warm, however, when the two fathers head down to Apu's store to indulge in their mutual love of doughnuts.

The children also share bonding sessions, with Bart giving Stewie a lesson in his trademark prank call to Moe's tavern.

Stewie isn't quick to catch on, though, and tries his own hoax - which falls down with disturbing flatness.

'Hello, Moe,' he begins. 'Your sister's just been raped.'

Bar bickering: Having bonded over their love of doughnuts, Peter and Homer argue over which beer is best

Later, Homer and Peter's friendship breaks down into a full-scale battle after they argue about beer.

Their fight sees them turned into Incredible Hulk-style characters after a nuclear disaster at Springfield power plant in a parody of a recurring Family Guy in-joke that often sees Peter coming to blows with a giant chicken called Ernie.

But the teaser also appeared to dash hopes of a series developing from the collaboration.

When Lois remarks that 'this Springfield place seems nice, we should visit here again', Brian replies: 'I don’t know Lois, this looks like a one-shot deal.'

Simpsons regulars Hank Azaria, Dan Castellenata, Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright will feature in the special episode while Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, who voices Peter, as well as the usual Family Guy cast, will also star.

McFarlane has previously featured Homer, Marge and various other Simpson’s characters in Family Guy, amongst them The Juice is Loose, a 2009 episode in which Peter befriends another Simpson – O.J.

Dan Castellanata – who voices Homer – also gave a one-liner in a 2012 episode of the show, with MacFarlane making an appearance in The Simpsons last May.

Family Guy has also taken good-natured swipes at the blocky animation used in early episodes of The Simpsons, which originally launched in 1989.

The Simpsons Guy will premiere on Fox in the U.S. on September 28.
