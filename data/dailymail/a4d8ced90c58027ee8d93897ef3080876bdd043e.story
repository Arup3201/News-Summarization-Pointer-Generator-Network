Dubai and the Caribbean are not just for the rich and famous, especially as we start to chase winter sun to escape the grey skies of Britain.

These deluxe destinations are among the most affordable places to find almost guaranteed sunshine during our bleak winter, research by Kayak.co.uk has found.

For average temperatures above 26 degrees celsius and the cheapest flights in October, look no further than Cyprus's Larnaca - a return flight to the popular island off southern Turkey will set you back just £148 next month.

Summer escape: Dubai Marine Beach Resort becomes even more appealing during winter in Britain

Popular during summer and holding onto the season more than much of Europe, and at even more affordable prices than its high season, is Spain's Tenerife with flights at about £169 return in October.

Dubai is next on the list, great value at £333 to get there and back, but the city really comes into its own in November and December as the days get shorter and shorter in the northern hemisphere.

After Dubai comes sun-soaked southern USA havens including West Palm Beach in Florida and Palm Strings in California with prices at £464 and £519.

Dubai's year-round rays sees it to the top of the list for November and December, enticing tourists the cheapest return flights for a place expecting 26-plus degrees.

Mexico's party town Cancun is also an affordable sun trap to fly to  in November, as are the Caribbean twin island country of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados's capital Bridgetown, Vieeux Fort in Saint Lucia, Georgetown in The Bahamas and Grenada.

Other top value options for that winter sun break include the rarely cheap Honolulu in Hawaii and Salvador in Brazil.

When Christmas comes around and pasty skin becomes the norm, Dubai is by far the most modest option for return flights with £268 return flights, although the figures don't factor in the cost of accommodation and entertainment once you're there. 

India steps up to the plate big time at Christmas as well with trips to the hustle and bustle of Mumbai or Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala well worth considering at a cost of £360 and £442 respectively. 

For a more subdued setting, the sun continues to shine in the old favourite Hawaii with cheap flights to Honolulu, Kailua Kona and Lihu all less than £610.
