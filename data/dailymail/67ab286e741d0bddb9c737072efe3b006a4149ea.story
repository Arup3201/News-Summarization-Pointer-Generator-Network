England were denied a rare win on German soil  by a saved penalty and the upright as the Under-19s were held to 1-1 draw against their bitter rivals.

Not since the senior side beat Germany 2-1 in a 2008 friendly, with John Terry's late header, have England or any of the sides at youth level won here, but the Under 19s came within a whisker.

Goals from England striker Bradley Fewster and Germany's Timo Werner either side of half time eventually decided this tie at the Stadion Niederrhein in Oberhausen.

Germany Under-19s: Funk, Baumgartl, Fohrenbach, Kijewski, Klostermannm Christiansen, Dahoud, Ristl, Sane, Cueto, Werner.

England Under-19s: Gunn, Smith Brown, Chilwell, Morris, Gomez, Galloway, Kiwomya, Alli, Fewster, Colkett, Roberts. 

The game was tight and anxious until Middlesbrough's Fewster broke the deadlock with a well-taken goal on 37 minutes.

Dele Alli was busy and bustling in the middle of the park and his pressure paid off when he pinched the ball from Mahmoud Dahoud and passed to Fewster on the edge of the box. The teenager took a touch around centre-back Niko Kijewski and sent a low shot under Marius Funk from eight yards.

But Germany struck back in the 59th minute with a well-worked goal. Patrick Pflucke found Boubacar Barry on the right in, from England's point of view, too much space and he sent in a low cross which Werner slid in.

From there, the match completely opened up. Manchester City left-back Ashley Smith Brown struck the right post on 64 minutes after twisting and turning two defenders inside out before curling an effort across goal. When the ball came back off the upright, Alli followed up with a low shot but it was saved by Germany goalkeeper Marius Funk.

England won a penalty two minutes later when goal-scorer Fewster was clattered in the box by Steffen Nkansah, but he stepped up to take it and his effort was saved by Funk, diving low to his left.

Straight up the other end, Germany broke and Leroy Sane struck a powerful drive which England goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of Scotland and Norwich stopper Bryan, could only beat out.

But England were dangerous on the break, too. In the 79th minute Joshua Aina passed from his own half to Demarai Gray on the right then charged forward. Gray played him in with the return pass and Aina's low shot across goal flew agonisingly wide.

Then, on 86 minutes, centre-half Brendan Galloway, who moved from MK Dons to Everton in the summer, tore forward from the back. He ran on to Brandon Barker's high ball, in behind the defence, and went for a flick over the on-rushing goalkeeper but the move required the subtler finish of a forward and the ball dropped over the bar.

Line-up: England's young lions pose for a photo before their 1-1 draw with Germany in Oberhausen

Liverpool target Alli, 18, was immense in the centre of the park. Scouts from top-flight clubs have followed him closely at MK Dons over the past 18 months and manager Karl Robinson suggested recently he is one of the most talented teenagers England have ever produced.

Fulham winger Patrick Roberts ghosted past the German players for fun and had the opposition constantly on the back foot running scared.

Roberts, 17, has tried to style his game on Lionel Messi – there's no harm in aiming at the top – and his low centre of gravity enables him to shimmy and shift the ball around and through players as if they weren't there. In the first half the 5ft 5ins player was a much-used outlet on the left-hand side to build England's attacks. It was just a shame that one of those did not turn in to a second goal.

John Peacock, in charge of the side before handing over to new manager Sean O'Driscoll, said: 'There are bits we can work on without a doubt but I'm very pleased with them. They're a great group, they listen intently, they work hard, they put a shift in.

'The result didn't quite come off, but the performance was key and we said that from the very beginning. Produce a performance and you'll be fine.

'The message we give to the players now: Go back to your clubs, get back into your club environment, keep working hard and doing the things which got you here in the first place.'
