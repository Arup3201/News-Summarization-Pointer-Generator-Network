Parts of Britain are becoming as 'scary' as American gangland cities, The Kinks frontman has warned.

Ray Davies was shot nine years ago by a mugger in New Orleans and said similar gun attacks are on the rise here.

'It is disturbing how it is now on the increase, even in my home area of Muswell Hill,' he said.

The 69-year-old musician said when he was held up by the gunman he was surprised his instinct was to fight back.

'You know about fight or flight - well I responded with fight,' he told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival.

'I found it totally unacceptable. I don't think people realise how they will react or behave in any given instance.

'You expect you will be passive but for some reason I was incensed and I chased the guy down the street.

'A car came with his accomplices in it and he took up the classic stance and shot me.'

Performing with The Kinks, Ray Davies said despite the band's success in the States where he was shot, he woke up in hospital with the name tag 'Unknown Purple' as nobody knew who he was

He described the experience as 'shocking' but not as shocking as not being recognised by the paramedics who saved him.

'It was a very humbling experience' he said.
