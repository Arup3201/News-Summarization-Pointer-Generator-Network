The death of a father-of-three who was stabbed in a row over a bike was not murder or manslaughter, a coroner has ruled.

Now the family of Liam Mearns, 21, are devastated after it was ruled that there was not enough proof that the tragedy was an unlawful killing.

Twelve people were arrested after Mr Mearns suffered a fatal wound that sliced into his lung and punctured his liver in Clacton, Essex, on December 13, 2011. All were eventually released without charge.

Loss: Liam Mearns, 21, was 
stabbed to death in December 2011. A coroner ruled his death was not 
unlawful. His fiancee Hollie Morgan says she is 'devastated' about the decision.

Mr Mearns also suffered a second stab wound that went through his cheek and cut through one of his teeth.

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray yesterday recorded an open verdict at his inquest, saying there was not enough proof it was murder or manslaughter.

His family and friends shouted to Mrs Beasley-Murray to reconsider and change the ruling to unlawful killing.

Inconclusive: Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said there was insufficient proof that the death was murder or manslaughter

She considered the request but reaffirmed her decision.

After the inquest, Mr Mearns' tearful fiancee Hollie Morgan said: 'I don’t understand how they can say this was not a murder.

'Everyone can see he was stabbed. It’s not like he fell on the knife.'

Miss Morgan was expecting their second child when he was killed and gave birth to Gracie-May in April 2012.

She added: 'What am I supposed to tell my kids now? They have to grow up without their dad because of this and the court won’t even say it was a murder.

'We are all devastated.'

The inquest heard Mr Mearns was stabbed in a row over a bicycle.

Family and friends broke down in tears when doctors described the horrific injuries he suffered.

Dr Ben Swift, a forensic pathologist, said: 'There were two incised wounds that were caused by a sharp-edged weapon.

'It would have required severe force to inflict the wound to his face, but the wound to his chest was fatal.'

Mr Mearns stumbled away from the scene and collapsed outside nearby store Bootleggers.

Dr Swift said he did not have any defensive injuries, which would have suggested he had been in a fight.

He said the victim had been drinking on the day of the incident and had traces of cannabis in his system.

Brutal: The father-of-three was stabbed in the chest and in the face. 12 people were arrested in connection with his death but all were eventually released without charge

A total of 12 people were arrested in
 connection with the killing, but the last suspect was released without 
charge in May last year.

Essex
 Police said the Crown Prosecution Service had advised there was 
insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson, the investigating officer, explained the events that led to the stabbing.

Police have agreed to meet with Mr Mearns' family to discuss the case.

They were able to question Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson at the inquest.

Liam’s aunt, Katie Norfolk said: 'It would be nice for us as a family to get more information.

'We sit at home waiting for something to happen.

'We would like to see the case reopened to look at the evidence again.'

Det Con Insp Robinson said: 'The case was reviewed by us and the Crown Prosecution Service and significant issues were raised around the inconsistencies between accounts and the credibility of the witnesses.'

She said an off-duty police officer saw the commotion and discovered Liam’s body.

It was alleged Ben Mills-Matheou, one of Liam’s friends, had taken a bike that belonged to Danny Mellowship.

Mr Mellowship is alleged to have confronted Mr Mills-Matheou who then called Liam.

Mr Mearns and a group of others are thought to have gone to Mr Mellowship’s house in Wellesley Road.

Miss Morgan called her father Andrew Morgan and asked him to stop her fiance. Mr Morgan told the inquest he arrived to find Liam doubled over.

Mrs Beasley-Murray recorded an open verdict, saying there was insufficient evidence for her to label it an unlawful killing.

She said: 'This court has a duty to look afresh at the evidence and is not fettered by any decision made by the Crown Prosecution Service.

'This court is not sure to the required standard of proof that this is murder or manslaughter. We shall never quite know what exactly happened in the darkness on that day.

'What began as a seemingly trivial dispute earlier in the day got completely and tragically out of hand.

'A young man has lost his life and three young children will grow up without their father.

'It is to be hoped that lessons have been learned all round.'
