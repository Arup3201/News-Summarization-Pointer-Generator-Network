All 50 states of America will see snow this week as the nation is plunged into the coldest month for decades.

For the first time since 2010, meteorologists predict two snow storms barreling through the country in the next seven days will engulf Florida - a usually snow-less state.

It comes as cold weather records continue to fall across the country, with February declared the coldest month in New York for 81 years. 

The average temperature in the Big Apple over the last four weeks has been 24F - 11 degrees below normal. New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades.

As the mercury continues to plummet, ice breakers are being deployed by the US Coast Guard to create ferry and shipping lanes along the Hudson River in New York and the Delaware in Philadelphia.

According to The New York Times, it has not been this frigid in New York since February 1934.

That month it averaged 19.9F. On February 9 of that year, the mercury sank to 15 degrees below zero - the lowest daily reading in the city's history.

The only other February on record that was cold than this past month was in 1885 - when the average daily temperature was 22.7 degrees

Jay Engle, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told The Times: 'It was like the most sick month you can think of.'

As the records continue to tumble - with almost 500 daily low-points being beaten in the last month - forecasters predict there's more on the way.

This next winter storm will begin to take shape Saturday in California as a disturbance digs into the Southwest, bringing rain in the lower elevations and snow in the mountains.

Snow, sleet and ice will then spread eastward across the Plains, Midwest and Northeast through midweek. 

Texas has already seen six inches of snow as a result of the storm, with Oklahoma - seven inches - and New Mexico - one foot - also suffering from the wintry downpours.

Boston's all-time winter weather record is also at risk, after 102 inches of snow fell on the city in the space of a month.

Insurance companies in the area are getting a historic number of claims from homeowners whose properties have been damaged by the weight of the snow.

Experts say that popping, creaking, or cracking noises can be signs of a stressed roof that could be about to collapse. Residents are warned to leave immediately in those cases.

Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, told the Boston Globe: 'If you are hearing loud cracking, like cracking wood, there is something going on up there. But if it’s just a variety of sounds, don’t automatically get everyone out of the building.'

Wintry conditions also caused chaos across the southeastern United States this week as the area saw an unprecedented amount of snowfall.   

Wet, heavy snow snapped tree limbs and cut power lines in North Carolina leaving more than 200,000 Duke Energy customers without electricity at one point. Nearly a foot of snow fell in parts of Alabama - closing roads, schools and businesses. 

A volunteer who works with the National Weather Service measured 11 inches of snow in the Guntersville area in the morning. Authorities said 8.5 inches of snow fell in the Athens area, with similar amounts reported in other towns and cities across northern Alabama.
