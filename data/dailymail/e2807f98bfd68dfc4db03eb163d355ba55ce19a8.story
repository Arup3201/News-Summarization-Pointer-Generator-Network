A Star Trek fanatic who spent thousands of pounds turning his flat into a replica of the Starship Enterprise was jailed today for downloading and passing on child porn.

Tony Alleyne, 60, who kitted out his flat in Hinckley, Leicester, with a computerised flight deck, voice-activated lighting and a set of 'transporters' over his ten-year project, once claimed: 'Some people might think I'm a bit of a sad individual, but I'm not. I'm just really into Star Trek - it's my only vice.'

But he was sentenced to 34 months in jail today after police discovered a 'massive' collection of more than 5,000 pornographic pictures involving babies, children and animals.

Alleyne, who is unemployed, had also distributed dozens of images - some rated at the most serious level five - Leicester Crown Court heard.

The sci fi obsessive, who had given dozens of interviews and appeared on TV shows including MTV's Extreme Cribs and ITV's May The Best House Win, was picked up by an internet crime unit last autumn.

Police raided his flat in September and seized computer equipment, although Alleyne refused to answer any questions in interview or reveal the passports to his five email accounts.

Among the 5,083 pornographic pictures found on the computer after it was analysed were shocking sexual images involving babies and animals.

Victoria Rose, prosecuting, said Alleyne was also discovered to have emailed 135 pictures to another paedophile. 

She added that when police were finally able to enter the email accounts Alleyne had refused to give access to, they found they had been deleted.

But officers were able to recover a chat log between Alleyne and another man in which they discussed swapping child porn material.

Alleyne was last in the media spotlight in January 2012, when his ex-wife tried to dismantle his Star Trek features - based on a mixture of the 1979 USS Enterprise and the starship Voyager from the 1990s series - to make the flat easier to sell.

Among the features in the flat is a doorbell that 'rings' with a soundbite from Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).

Alleyne has admitted ten counts each of making and distributing indecent images of children between January 2010 and September 2012.

He also pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals.

Judge Philip Head, sentencing, told him: 'Over a period of two-and-three-quarter years, you accessed child pornography in massive quantities.

'Without people like you consuming such material, there would be no market and these poor, desperate children would not be treated in such a way.

'You have shown no insight or remorse, save for being caught.'

Alleyne was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
