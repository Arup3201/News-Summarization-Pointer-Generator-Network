Injured: Anthony Gambale, 19, and Gabriella Katanov, 17, pictured, were critically injured with second- and third-degree burns in the blast that took place inside a Marine Parkway garage in Brooklyn early Tuesday

A pair of teen sweethearts have been rushed to hospital after an experiment to make their marijuana stash more potent ended in a fiery explosion, police said.

Anthony Gambale, 19, and Gabriella Katanov, 17, were critically injured with second- and third-degree burns in the blast that took place inside a Marine Parkway garage in Brooklyn, early Tuesday.

The couple were trying to make what's called 'ear wax' marijuana - a version 80 per cent stronger than usual pot and highly hallucinatory - by soaking the drug in butane.

However, as they were evaporating off the gas, one of them lit a cigarette and the garage went up in flames.

According to the New York Daily News, the explosion rocked the sleeping residential neighborhood and residents could hear the pair begging for help.

'We could see the flames and hear people yelling for help,' next-door neighbor Pat Doyle told the Daily News.

Gambale and Katanov are both in serious condition at Staten Island University Hospital.

'Their lungs are good... but from the waist up, all burned,' the girl's devastated mother, Luba Poukhova, told the Daily News.

Scene: The blast occurred in the garage of a home, pictured, in Marine Park, Brooklyn

Experiment: Officials reported the explosion occurred as a result of a huge marijuana experiment involving butane. They were transported to Staten Island University Hospital North and now face drug charges

'Her hands, too. She could be in the hospital for a year. She needs surgery. The doctors said it will get worse every day.'

Poukhova said her daughter attended 
Rachel Carson High School and had been dating Gambale, a friend since 
childhood, for around seven months.

On Monday night, Gabriella went out about 8 p.m., promising to be home by 11 p.m., the mother told the Daily News.

Potent: The couple were allegedly trying to make the extremely powerful form of marijuana, known as 'ear wax,' pictured, for its yellowish color and gooey consistency

Police said the couple were trying to
 make the extremely powerful form of marijuana, known as 'ear wax,' for 
its yellowish color and gooey consistency. Gambale and Katanov had 
filled a blue 30-gallon tub with cannabis and covered it in butane, 
according to police.

Officers also found pot plants, plastic storage containers, plastic tabs, coffee filters and glass pans on the premises.

Drug charges are pending for the teens.

Also nicknamed 'dabs,' 'honey oil,' or 
'butter,' the turbo-charged high is far stronger than normal pot
 and has become a growing problem in parts of the country, according to 
drug addiction specialists.

'The symptoms of wax, dabs, or butter include psychotic breaks, having hallucinations, seeing things that are not there, hearing things that are not there, having tactile sensations like something's crawling under my skin,' Jon Daily, the founder of Recovery Happens Counseling Services, told KCRA.com last month.

He added: 'It's much more addictive. I think there's going to be psychological ramifications to come. I think we're going to see more psychosis with it, more anxiety with it. We're going to see more sleep problems with it.'

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the drug in marijuana that induces a high. While pot contains roughly 20 per cent THC, ear wax can contain up to 90 per cent of it.
