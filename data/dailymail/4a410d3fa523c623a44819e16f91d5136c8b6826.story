Bentley is going ‘green’ by switching its luxury cars to ‘plug-in’ electric hybrid power within two years.

And by the end of the decade nine out of 10 of the sporty British cars will have the option of charging up from the mains to improve their fuel efficiency and reduce their high CO2 emissions by up to 70 per cent.

It means the luxury leviathans could soon have emissions as low as a standard Ford Fiesta hatchback.

New design: Bentley will switch its luxury cars to 'plug-in' electric hybrid power

Engine: The hybrid system will offer a power increase of up to 25 per cent together with a 70 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions

Power-up: The cars, which currently fail to average 17 miles to the gallon, will be more fuel efficient with the electric chargers

The luxury car-maker is harnessing the technology now familiar to motorists since the launch of Toyota’s petrol-electric Prius, to make even its biggest and most expensive limousines more frugal and green.

t will match its conventional petrol engines to an on-board electric motor which can be charged from the mains, but also use electric power generated from braking .

Bentley bosses at Crewe say that after a full charge, their ‘plug-in’ hybrids will be able to run on electric power alone for up to 30 miles.

It also means that cars which now fail to average 17 miles to the gallon will go many miles further per fill-up.

Stylish: Bentley says its new £110,000 sports utility vehicle will be 'the most luxurious and powerful sports utility vehicle on the market'

Decor: The Carbon-efficient model will have the same lavish interior as the model it is based on, the Mulsanne

Gearstick: The model, which uses a manual gearbox, will be able to travel for 30 miles on electricity alone

Bentley is to showcase its new technology at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition in China on Sunday using a prototype electric hybrid Bentley Mulsanne.

Bentley says it will boost performance and efficiency without compromising luxury.

But the first production car in which electric power will feature is the firm’s new 4X4 sports utility vehicle to be launched in 2017. Bentley says its new £110,000 sports utility vehicle will be ‘the most luxurious and powerful sports utility vehicle on the market’ and expects to sell 3,000 a year. It will be followed by a new ‘baby’ Bentley, the fifth model in the range.

Grill: Bentley claims the new design will boost performance and efficiency without comprising looks and luxury

Wheels: The same 4X4 technology used in the non-hybrid models will be adapted and installed on the car

A Bentley spokesman said: ‘The plug-in hybrid system will offer a power increase of up to 25per cent together with a 70per cent reduction in CO2 emissions, both without any compromise to the exquisite luxury, timeless design and industry-leading refinement for which Bentley has become renowned.

‘Bentley hybrids will also be capable of driving at least 30miles on electric power alone, allowing for emissions-free city driving with the option of enhanced performance on the open road. ‘

The Bentley hybrid prototype is based on the flagship £230,000 Mulsanne. The current model has a 6.75 litre V8 petrol engine developing which propels it from rest to 60mph in just 5.1 seconds up to a top speed of 184mph.

Acceleration: It will be able to reach speeds of up to 184mph and will reach 60mph in just 5.1 seconds

But on fuel efficiency it manages just a gas-guzzling 16.7 miles to gallon with whopping CO2 emissions of 393grammes per kilometre.

If an electric hybrid version achieved the promised 70 per cent reduction in C02 emissions, this would take it down to around 118g/km – or about the same as a standard 1.25 litre Ford Fiesta or an Audi A1 hatchback. The more frugal ECOboost Ford Fiesta manages 99g/km.

Bentley has already announced 100 new jobs and record profits of £140million after revealing it will be exporting its powerful engines abroad for the first time in its history – including to Germany – from next year. Bentley, which is part of the giant Volkswagen Group, is to become a ‘centre of excellence’ for all large 12-cylinder W12 engine production which will be exported for use in other cars in the VW conglomerate – including Volkswagens and Audis - from the end of next year.

Bentley Motors’ headquarters in Crewe is home to all of its operations including design, research and development, engineering and production of the company’s three model lines, Continental, Flying Spur and Mulsanne. The 4X4 will be the fourth model and the proposed ‘baby’ Bentley the fifth.
