Scotland Yard has seen a leap in the number of people reporting online abuse and bullying -  and the figures are set to rise, a senior police officer said today.

It comes after a number of high profile online 'Twitter trolling' bullying cases, where users of the site are bombarded with threats and abuse, many involving celebrities.

Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey told members of the Greater London Assembly that the force has seen a rise in crimes linked to online harassment and bullying.

Around 1,500 additional crimes linked to online abuse are being reported to Scotland Yard per year and the number looks set to rise, a senior police officer said today

Mr Mackey said: 'We're seeing about 1,500 additional offences reported to us per year.

Under Section 127 of the 
Communications Act 2003 it is an offence to ‘send by means of a public 
electronic communications network a message or other matter that is 
grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character’.

Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000.

'I think it will rise as people become more aware of this.'

Investigators face difficulties including many social media companies being based in the US, where laws are different; the difficulty of providing legally robust evidence for court cases and trolls using false identities or software to cover their IP address, he said.

This follows torrents of abuse that were directed at a number of high profile women on Twitter. 

It began with feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, from north London, who was subjected to a string of violent and obscene messages after she was involved in a campaign to have a woman's picture printed on a new banknote.Earlier this month she complained that she had been made to trawl through the abuse to provide evidence for police. 

She said: 'It's just appalling. I got an email saying 'why don't you go through what you've had' from three users with certain handles. It just shows such insensitivity to someone who's been through so much.'

In July, historian Mary Beard got her own back on Twitter trolls after using the site to name and shame a student posting vile abuse on her profile

Today Mr Mackey said that the force has investigators who could have looked through the material. He said: 'I don't know why she went back through each and every one.'

Ms Caroline Criado-Perez has since closed her account on the social networking site. 

She
was subjected to abuse along with Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy who was 
targeted after she offered support to the freelance journalist.

Classicist
and television historian Professor Mary Beard, Guardian columnist 
Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of 
Time magazine Catherine Mayer were also among those who received 
threatening messages. 

Since then, Twitter has introduced a 'report Tweet' button.

Ms Beard retweeted – or forwarded – to her thousands of followers a message from Oliver Rawlings in which he called her a ‘filthy old s***’ with a revolting sexual comment.

It prompted a flurry of online support for the 58-year-old TV presenter – including an offer from one of her 42,000 followers to pass on the home address of her abuser’s mother.

Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000.

Trolls can also be charged if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, they send an electronic message which they know is false.

In 2010, Colm Coss, from Manchester, was jailed for 18 weeks under Section 127 after posting obscene messages on Facebook tribute sites, including one for former Big Brother star Jade Goody.

Last year Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 weeks after posting explicit comments and jokes about April and Madeleine McCann.

Also in October Azhar Ahmed, 20, of Fir Avenue, Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was ordered to carry out 240 hours community service and pay a fine of £300 after posting an offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers.

He wrote: ‘All soldiers should die and go to hell.’

In 2007, 498 people were successfully convicted under Section 127, including 96 in the South East. It has risen sharply each year to top 1,286 in 2011, including 227 in the South East. Latest figures are soon to be published.

In total, there have been 4,536 successful prosecutions from 2007-11.
