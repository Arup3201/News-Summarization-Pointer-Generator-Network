One of Tony Abbott's top advisers has warned that Australia has become obsessed with global warming and instead should be worried about global cooling.

In a comment piece written for The Australian, Chief Business Adviser Maurice Newman claimed that the country was 'ill-prepared' for plummeting temperatures and dismissed scientific research that suggest the earth is getting hotter.

'The warmth the world has enjoyed for the past 50 years is the result of solar activity, not man-made CO2', he wrote in a controversial blog published on Thursday.

He claimed that politicians have 'put all (their) eggs in one basket' and 'made science a religion... ignoring at its peril and ours, the clear warnings being given by Mother Nature'.

The former ABC chairman laid the blame for current policy on the government's 'biased research to pursue “green” gesture politics.' 

However, his comments have provoked a furious backlash from scientists who said that his ideas were not based on any scientific evidence.

Adam Bandt, Green's Deputy leader, labelled Mr Newman's ideas 'almost deranged' and said that Tony Abbott had 'no choice but to dump him as head of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council'. 

Ian Dunlop, scientist for the Climate Change Taskforce, also criticised Mr Newman, branding his comments 'arrogant'.

'The reality is that virtually all the informed scientists around the world and every major institution like the world bank and UN, are investigating climate change in great detail because it is an incredibly complicated problem', he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The vast majority of scientists are saying it is a big problem and we need to get on with addressing it'.

Adviser to the Abbott Government, Maurice Newman claims citizens are ill-prepared for global cooling because of biased scientific research led by governments

Labor's environment spokesperson Mark Butler took to Twitter to express disbelief over Mr Newman's claims

He said that the government had avoided addressing the issue because of the implications for the economy.

'Unfortunately the governments have been finding it very difficult to take any actions because it means fundamentally changing the way the economy works,' he said.

Mr Dunlop said that inaction to tackle the problem was down to fear. 'It all sounds quite scary and it is a huge thing to do, but we do have solutions, we just have to do it,' he said.

'Both Labor and Liberal have agreed that we have to cut emissions down by five per cent by 2020 but the real action we require is that we need to reduce it 50 per cent by 2020.'

Global warming scientist Dr Bradley Opdyke dismissed Mr Newman's claim that there the climate was getting cooler rather than warmer. 

'The ocean actually says it is getting warmer. 'If you are looking for evidence, good data comes from the ocean because it has a much higher heat capacity,' he said.

'Almost every year over the past 10-15 years there has been a record temperature highs, compared to the 20th centuries temperatures.'

Dispute: Climate change scientist Dr Bradely Opdyke said that scientists lacked faith that the government would take action on the issue

Dr Opdyke refuted Mr Newman's claim that climate change is from the sun, rather than CO2, based on no evidence to support that the 'sun's output is increasing over the years.'

'If these people who are meant to advise the government are saying these things, well they are clearly advising the wrong things,' he said, adding that Mr Newman's comments were based on 'absolutely no evidence' and that the research supporting global warming came in a 'truck load.'

'If he had any evidence to support those claims that it was cooler we would probably give him a Nobel Prize,' he said.

Speaking to The Guardian, Professor Mathew England described Mr Newman's comments as 'weird' and 'uneducated'.

'The idea that solar cycles can override climate change driven by greenhouse gases is fanciful', he said.

'Saying we aren't prepared for global cooling is like saying we aren't prepared for an alien invasion. There is no credible scientist saying this is on the horizon.'
