Ronda Rousey made UFC history yesterday by knocking out her opponent in just over a minute.Â 

The match-up between Rousey and Sara McMann was the main fight at the Ultimate Fighting Championship event held at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas Saturday night.

But the fight was over in just 66 seconds, after Rousey grounded McMann with a hit to the liver - the fastest knockout in UFC women's history.

One for the record books: The 66 second knockout was the quickest in UFC women's history. Women have been competing in UFC events since 2012

The fight started off with Rousey pushing McMann up against the fence and knee her.

Rousey tried to pull a judo throw but McMann defended it.

Rousey then landed a knee to McMann, followed by an elbow, another knee, another elbow and a final knee to the liver that knocked McMann to the ground.

McMann didn't get up fast enough and the referee called three strikes, securing the bantamweight victory for Rousey.

Ouch: Mann took several elbows to the face before bowing out

Too soon? Many in the crowd booed the knockout, thinking it was too premature

The crowd reacted with boos, clearly thinking the knockout was too early.

But McMann, who was previously undefeated, kept a good attitude despite her defeat.

'I thought it was a good fight. I got hit in the liver, and no matter how hard you train, you can't get your liver stronger,' McMann said. 'I hope to get a rematch and come back here and put on a better fight. I was trying to get back up, but it's my own fault. I should've gotten back to my feet quicker.'

Rousey continues to go unbeaten in both MMA and UFC (She's 9-0 in MMA, and 3-0 in UFC).

Women have been competing in UFC competition since 2012.

Winner, winner: The win Saturday secured Rousey the women's bantamweight belt
