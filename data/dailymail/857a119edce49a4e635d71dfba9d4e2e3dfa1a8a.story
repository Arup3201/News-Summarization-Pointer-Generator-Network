It can't be nice ending the dreams of the contestants she has nurtured throughout the competition.

But Jessie J was forced to choose between members of her team on tonight's episode of The Voice.

With only Vince Kidd safe from elimination following last night's performances, Jessie had to choose between the remaining three contestants.

Me really? Becky Hill seemed shocked that Jessie J chose her to go through to the semi-final

Jessie said the decision was difficult and added: 'A great thing as an artist is to have such an amazing quality of artists to choose from.'

The Domino singer said she had an extremely tough choice to make but selected Becky Hill to go through to the next stages of the competition.

Cassius Henry and Toni Warne are now out of the competition.

Before the show Jessie J had actually accidentally revealed her selection by posting a picture of herself with Vince and Becky to her Twitter page.

Tough decision: Jessie said it was difficult to chose someone from her own team because all three were very talented

Unbelievable! Becky seemed stunned by the news she was staying in the competition as she hugged her fellow team mates

Jessie J wasn't the only one who had to make some tough decisions tonight - Danny O'Donoghue was also tasked with axing members of his own team.

The Script singer said that Max Milner, David Julien and Aleks Josh were all on 'a level playing field of talent'.

Before making his decision he told Max: 'You write, you play, you take chances.'

All over: Cassius Henry and Toni Warne have been sent home and are out of the competition

Upset: It was obvious that Toni Warne and Cassius Henry were deeply upset by being sent home from the competition

He told Alex: 'I can see you selling a lot of records and you are wise beyond your years.'

To David he added: 'I see a lot of myself in you.'

But using his gut to make the decision he decided to save Max, much to the disappointment of the other two.

Max-imum talent! Danny chose to save Max sending two of his other contestants home

End of the road: Aleks Josh, David Julien were sent home despite Danny saying they had lots of talent

It was no surprise that Bo was saves after yesterday's performance of of Rihanna's Love The Way You Lie given that will.i.am told her she'd sung it 'a million times better' than the Grammy-winner.

Viewers were treated to a performance by Paloma Faith, who looked stunning in a glittering dress as she sang her new song Picking Up The Pieces.

The show's presenter Holly Willoughby also looked lovely in her tight black dress which boasted sheer paneling including a strip across her stomach for a very alluring look.
