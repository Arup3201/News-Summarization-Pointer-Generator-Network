David Cameron’s local hunt yesterday became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes.

The Heythrop Hunt, which the Prime Minister has ridden with, was fined £4,000 after it admitted four offences under laws introduced in 2005.

All previous prosecutions have been against named individuals. And yesterday Heythrop huntsman Julian Barnfield and recently retired master Richard Sumner pleaded guilty to the same four charges.

However, a judge sitting at Oxford 
Magistrates’ Court questioned whether the ‘staggering’ £330,000 the 
RSPCA spent on bringing the case was money well spent.

Outside court, Barnfield, 49, said he 
had been unable to afford to fight the charges and accused the animal 
charity of ‘playing politics’ by targeting a hunt in Mr Cameron’s Witney
 constituency.

The Prime Minister, who has promised a
 free vote on hunting in the Commons, rode with the Heythrop six times 
before the law changed.

The hunt is popular with his fellow 
members of the Chipping Norton Set – an influential group of MPs and 
media professionals who live close to the Cotswolds market town.

More than 230 people have been convicted of illegal fox hunting since it was outlawed by Labour almost eight years ago.

The majority of hunts continue to meet by using trail hunting, usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of fox urine across fields and woodlands.

Other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out quarry from woodland which can then be shot.

Yesterday was the first time the RSPCA had enough evidence to bring a prosecution against an entire hunt, rather than just individuals.

Graphic footage of foxes being 
attacked, which was taken by anti-hunt group Protect Our Wild Animals, 
was played to the court during yesterday’s hearing.

Describing a hunt in February, 
prosecutor Jeremy Carter-Manning, QC, said: ‘The hounds converge in to 
semi-circles and the screaming reaches a crescendo. The hounds are 
making a kill.’

The next clip showed the bloodied carcass of a fox clamped in the jaws of a hound, prompting gasps from a packed public gallery.

Passing sentence, district judge Tim 
Pattinson said: ‘Hunting of foxes provokes extremely strong feelings on 
both sides of the argument ... Some people see the hunting of foxes as 
cruel and immoral, others see it as an essential tradition, part of 
countryside management, and say criminalising the activity is 
inappropriate.

‘The coalition Government has indicated the possibility of a free vote in Parliament at some point in the future.

‘I must put all of these matters to one side. I must sentence fairly and in accordance with the law.’

The footage, pictured, showed evidence of 'prolonged and deliberate unlawful hunting,' said Mr Carter-Manning

Referring to the RSPCA costs for 
mounting the prosecution, he said: ‘It is not for me to express an 
opinion, I merely flag it up, but I do find it to be a quite staggering 
figure.’ He said the costs for all five defendants were only £35,000.

He fined 68-year-old Sumner £1,800 and
 Barnfield £1,000 for the offences which occurred on November 23 and 
November 30, 2011, and February 29 and March 7 this year.

The hunt was told to pay £15,000 towards the RSPCA’s costs, Sumner £2,500 and Barnfield £2,000.

Outside court, Barnfield said: ‘We conceded because the money wasn’t there to defend ourselves.

‘I would like to stand there and 
defend it but there was no way it was possible. The fact a charitable 
body can take on this political thing and spend so much money which 
other people have given them for another thing, is stunning.

‘I just hope their donors question 
what they are doing with their money. They could have picked on any 
other hunt but they picked on Heythrop because we are in David Cameron’s
 constituency.

‘They are trying to put pressure on him not to give a free vote like he said he would, to embarrass him in some way.’

Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA 
chief inspector Mike Butcher said: ‘The evidence in this case was 
incontrovertible – it clearly showed hounds being encouraged to pursue a
 fox.

‘This is illegal under the Hunting Act
 and constitutes a wildlife crime.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA denied the
 charity had targeted Heythrop and said it would prosecute illegal 
behaviour wherever it found it.

In their 2010 manifesto, the 
Conservatives promised a free vote in the House of Commons on whether to
 overturn the ban, but many doubt it will happen because Liberal 
Democrats are opposed to the proposal.

A growing number of younger female Tory MPs, nicknamed the ‘Blue Foxes’, are also said to be against any plans to lift the ban.
