A Texas mother who has been accused of starving her young stepson and keeping him locked in a closed sparked an Amber Alert Monday involving her newborn baby, who was later found safe.

Law enforcement officials in Houston launched a search Monday for Tammi Bleimeyer and her six-week-old son, William, but about an hour later the alert was cancelled.

Last week, a judge ordered Mrs Bleimeyer, of Houston, to surrender her newborn to child protective services, but on Monday afternoon the mother and son were nowhere to be found, sparking the Amber Alert.

Meanwhile, Tammi Bleimeyer is expected to appear in court Tuesday for a custody hearing regarding her seven children, who had been removed from her house.

On the mend: This photo of Jordan taken in April shows the 5-year-old smiling and looking much healthier while being treated at a hospital

In April, organizers of a Facebook toy drive and fundraiser for Jordan shared a photo of the 5-year-old smiling and looking much healthier while being treated at a hospital.

Jordan Bleimeyer allegedly told his biological mother and grandmother that he was padlocked in a closet, fed just a piece of bread and a cup of water or milk each day and plied with drugs when visitors came to the house to keep him quiet. 

Bradley Bleimeyer's 16-year-old stepson raised the alarm in March and told police he had found his five-year-old stepbrother in a diaper under the stairs.

Tammi Bleimeyer has claimed that she never mistreated the child and accused her teenage son for lying to the police because he did not respect his stepfather, who is only eight years older than him.
