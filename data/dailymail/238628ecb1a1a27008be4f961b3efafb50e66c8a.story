Having breezed through qualification from one of the World Cup's toughest groups with a game to spare, Louis van Gaal's squad were more than entitled to enjoy a day off in the sun ahead of their last-16 game against Mexico.

Robin van Persie and co have arguably been the tournament's most impressive team: thrashing world champions Spain 5-1, beating Australia 3-2 and finally seeing off World Cup surprise package Chile 2-0 to set themselves up for a favourable first knockout round draw.

And with incoming Manchester United manager Van Gaal already appearing to be adopting a laid back approach to the time off he gives his players in Brazil, United fans will be hoping that the same happy atmosphere can be replicated when Van Persie returns to Old Trafford with the new manager.

Van Persie appeared to be unhappy under David Moyes - with Rio Ferdinand labelling his transformation under last season's manager going from: 'the star man, our go-to guy, the top scorer, to being almost like a sideshow.'

But with Van Gaal replaced Moyes in the Old Trafford hotseat, the Dutch striker, who will return to the side after suspension, should be seen smiling a lot more next season.

The strong relationship beyond the two has been obvious since Holland's first game of the tournament - with captain Van Persie high-fiving Van Gaal in one of the defining images of the World Cup so far.

The Dutch squad, and their manager, enjoyed their rest day by the pool with their families before stepping up their preparations for the game against Mexico.

They will be the strong favourites to reach the quarter finals on Sunday, with bookmakers Coral offering odds of 1/2 on them to qualify ahead of the Mexicans who finished second behind hosts Brazil in Group A.

With Van Gaal keeping his eye on his stars from a distance the Dutch chatted with the fans while enjoying some snacks at the poolside.

Norwich City's Leroy Fer even managed to escape to the beaches in Rio to spend some quality time with his girlfriend.

Work wasn't too far from the mind though, with Van Persie leading his teammates in a game of head tennis.

Holland started the tournament as rank outsiders but are now considered joint-fourth favourites behind Brazil, Argentina and fellow Europeans Germany.

The hard work starts now though against Mexico who are unbeaten so far and proved hard to beat for Brazil. Van Gaal will undoubtedly be cooking up another plan to put off his starting the United job for a few more days.
