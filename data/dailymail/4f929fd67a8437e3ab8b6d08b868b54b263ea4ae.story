George Osborne said Tory MPs would not be forced to support David Cameron's renegotiation

Tory MPs will be allowed to campaign to leave the EU after the general election, George Osborne revealed this morning.

The Chancellor said MPs would get a 'free vote' to campaign how they want if the Tories were re-elected next year.

It means Conservative MPs will not have to support Mr Cameron's EU renegotiation even if the PM claims he has won back significant powers from Brussels.

Mr Osborne said: 'People will know what the Conservative Party's policy is. But ultimately it will be a free vote for backbench members of the Conservative Party - it's a referendum, of course.

'But people should be in no doubt that the Conservative government will put forward its proposal at the referendum, the reform that we will have achieved, the renegotiation that we will have achieved, the successful outcome of that renegotiation at the election.'

Mr Osborne insisted that the Government could campaign to leave the EU.

The Chancellor went on: 'If we didn't think it was in Britain's interests to be in the EU, we wouldn't argue for it, but we think it is in Britain's interests to change our relationship with Europe, improve the European economy and argue for that reform.

'Anyone who doubts that this Prime Minister will deliver should look at the Scottish referendum ... but we need to be in office to do that.'

Mr Osborne's remarks come amid growing concern that more eurosceptic Tory MPs are planning to defect to UKIP.

Rebel backbencher Mark Reckless announced his decision to leave the Conservative Party at the UKIP conference in Doncaster on Saturday.

He became the second sitting Tory to leave for Nigel Farage's party, following Douglas Carswell's defection last month.

Mr Reckless's defection, sparking a by-election in the Kent seat of Rochester and Strood, was the first of two blows for the Prime Minister at the start of this week's Conservative conference in Birmingham.

It came hours before charities minister Brooks Newmark was forced to resign after it emerged he had sent X-rated pictures of himself to an undercover reporter.

Mr Cameron, speaking yesterday, admitted the conference had not got off to the 'best of starts'.

London Mayor Boris Johnson, who will address a rally at the conference today, issued an appeal to any further would-be Tory defectors, urging them not to break ranks and join Nigel Farage's 'people's army'.

Writing in his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said Conservative MPs would be 'utterly nuts' to desert the party for Ukip as they simply risked handing power to Labour at next general election.

The Tory hierarchy sought to sought to regain the initiative today with Mr Osborne's announcement that taxes on pension pots would be scrapped.

Under plans revealed ahead of today's speech in Birmingham, savers will be able to pass on money in their pension pot tax-free to their children and grandchildren after their death.

The measure will apply to anyone inheriting cash held in a pension fund from April 2015 and is expected to benefit the families of hundreds of thousands of people to the tune of a total £150 million each year.

If the person passing on the pension pot is 75 or under, beneficiaries will only have to pay their marginal tax rate when drawing down the income, as they would with any pension. If they die over the age of 75 there will be no tax to pay at all.

Mr Osborne told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'At present, highly complex rules allow savers to pass on pensions without tax only to spouses or children under the age of 23, or in cases where they are under 75 and have not yet touched their pension pot.'

Mr Osborne has also announced plans to remove housing benefit from under-21s and cut the benefit cap by £3,000 to £23,000 to fund three million new apprenticeships.
