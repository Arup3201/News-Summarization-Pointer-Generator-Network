Iker Casillas is planning to swap shirts with Mario Balotelli when Liverpool visit the Bernabeu for their Champions League clash, but he'll wait until full time to do so.

The Italian forward was roundly criticised for swapping shirts with defender Pepe at half time when Real Madrid visited Anfield for their recent Group B match.

Casillas told Sportsmail he was keen to swap shirts with the former Manchester City man at the end of the game, but revealed he didn't really see the problem with doing it half time.

Liverpool are currently third in their hotly-contested Champions League group. 

Real Madrid are within touching distance of qualification on nine points from three games while Ludogorets, Liverpool and FC Basle are all level on three.
