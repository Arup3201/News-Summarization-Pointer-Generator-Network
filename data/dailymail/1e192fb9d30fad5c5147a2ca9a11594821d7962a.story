Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly have been moved to a Peruvian jail cell which they must share with 38 other inmates.

The British women, both 20, had shared a room for the past two months at Virgen de Fatima, prison in the capital of Lima.

Now they are in a cell that holds 40 where they have to queue for the one cold shower and lavatory.

Health: A French academic specialising in female prisons in Peru, said health was the biggest problem in such large communal cells

Melissa's father, William, said he is concerned for his daughter's well-being.

'They probably had it good in the other cell, but now it's totally different for them,' he said.

'It's really worrying. It all adds to the concern. I hope they're safe.'

Chloe Constant, a French academic specialising in female prisons in Peru, said health was the biggest problem in such large communal cells.

'When you're living in such close proximity to other prisoners, disease can spread quickly,' she said.

'Skin diseases are very common, especially fungal infections.

'Tuberculosis is also a big problem, and even HIV.

Michaella McCollum Connolly and Melissa Reid now face sharing with 38 other woman and will experience shocking poverty inside the new prison

McCollum and Reid initially claimed they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from Lima to Spain with 24lb of cocaine

'There is great poverty inside these jails, and that will be a shock.'

She added that the pair might be transferred to the tough Ancon 2 prison in the desert outside Lima.

The women were caught in August smuggling Â£1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

McCollum and Reid initially claimed they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage when they were arrested.

But in September McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Reid, from Glasgow, pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge.

They had hoped the behind-closed-doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence

However, the prosecutor in charge of their case said that the pair could face a six-month investigation if their guilty pleas are rejected.

Speaking after the hearing, Juan Mendoza said that the women's confessions had not satisfied prosecutors.

If their pleas are turned down by the court, prosecutors could force them to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs.

Mr Mendoza refused to say whether or not the women had told him anything more about the gang.

In a video, Reid says she was forced to take 'these bags' in her luggage. She says she didn't know there were drugs inside them
