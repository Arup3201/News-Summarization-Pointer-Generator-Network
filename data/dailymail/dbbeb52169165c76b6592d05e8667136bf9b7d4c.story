A teenager who was given painkillers and antacids after complaining of stomach pains died of bowel cancer just weeks after her misdiagnosis.

Layla Watt, 19, visited her GP surgery at least five times in January and February of this year, but each time she saw a different doctor.

Each one suspected she was suffering with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) until her final appointment in February when the GP said her symptoms required immediate attention.

She died from bowel cancer that had spread to her liver in April.

Layla Watt died aged just 19 because doctors failed to recognise that she was suffering with bowel cancer. She was repeatedly given painkillers and indigestion medication to relieve her symptoms

Layla, of Cleland, Lanarkshire in Scotland, started to complain of pains in her side and having a swollen stomach in January.

She was seen by different GPs on four separate occasions at the Wishaw Health Centre and because Layla's mother and sister suffered with IBS, the doctors presumed her problems were symptomatic of the same condition.

As the weeks went by Layla complained of extreme fatigue, loss of appetite and developed an intense thirst. She was offered routine blood tests but they were not classed as urgent.

Her concerned mother Margaret, 56, eventually insisted on accompanying her on a visit to the surgery on February 19. The doctor who examined her said her symptoms required urgent treatment and she was immediately rushed to hospital where she was given a scan.

Doctors discovered a tumour that had wrapped itself around her bowel. The cancer had also spread to her liver.

Layla was transferred to Glasgow's Beatson Hospital and despite chemotherapy, her condition worsened and she passed away on April 30.

'Full of life': Her mother Margaret said that Layla (pictured age six, left, and age four in dance clothes) was a 'unique, bubbly and beautiful person' who as a teenager loved going out with friends and listening to music

Mrs Watt has opened up about how she held Layla's hand in her final moments just 10 weeks after she had been diagnosed with cancer. She said:  'Layla was a unique, bubbly and beautiful person. Being a typical teenager she loved music and going on with her friends.

'She was just so full of life and things were just starting for her, but in January this year she started complaining about feeling ill.

'She wouldn't be able to go out [with friends] because of a sore pain in her side.

'As
 time wore on she went to the doctors again and again. She had been to 
the doctors about four or five times, but each time she was prescribed 
something different.

Layla (pictured, right, in 2012 with her mother Margaret, left, and her sister Emma, centre) had initially been diagnosed with IBS but doctors eventually realised she was suffering from bowel cancer

'She would never finish the course of the drugs and I was always on at her to take them. But she would say they were making her feel worse, not better.

'She lost her appetite and her stomach swelled up but we thought she was putting on a bit of weight.

'But on February 17 she was crying and saying she thought something was really wrong.

'She told me she thought she had cancer. I broke down in tears, but looking back it was almost as if she knew.

Doctors eventually discovered that Layla had developed a tumour that had wrapped itself around her bowel. The cancer had also spread to her liver by the time she was diagnosed

'Two days later I took her to the doctor again and insisted on going into the room with her.

'After a quick examination the doctor looked at me and told me she needed to get to hospital immediately.'

Her father Bobby said: 'We were just speechless. This was our young, healthy teenage daughter who was so healthy and had everything to live for. The worse part of knowing the truth was knowing that Layla had to be told too.

'She was 19, an adult and she had a right, but we just wanted to save her.

Layla (pictured left as a one-year-old with her sister Emma, then 14, and brother Bobby, then six) fought against the cancer but died on April 30

Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year.

Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss.

It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women.

Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly.

The number of young people with bowel cancer has more than doubled in ten years. Obesity and lack of exercise are blamed for the 120 per cent rise in cases among under-30s between 1997 and 2006.

Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease increases your risk of developing disease.

The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent.

'We didn't want her to be frightened. A doctor explained that without treatment she wouldn't survive. That day, our whole world just fell apart.'

Layla remained in the Beatson Centre where she was treated and visited by her parents and her older sister Emma Haddow, 33, and brother Bobby, 25.

But after just 10 weeks she lost her battle against the disease.

Mrs Watt said: 'When Layla was admitted, we were just in such shock, even Layla was convinced she was going to get better.

'She even updated her Facebook status telling her friends that she did have cancer, but she would get better.

'But every day I watched my beautiful daughter grow weaker and weaker, I just felt so helpless, so useless.

'She
 was in a single room because she was so sick and from then on, I 
just slept in a chair beside her.

Bobby was given a fold-down bed and 
stayed with her every moment for her final month.

'In the last three days of her life she couldn’t speak but I knew she could hear us.'

On
 April 30, Margaret woke up and noticed Layla's breathing had become 
laboured.

Bobby called for the nurse and they advised the parents to 
call in siblings Emma and Bobby.

'Later that day she slipped away. We 
were numb, shell-shocked, devastated,' added Mrs Watt. 'It had all 
happened so fast and it we were living our worst nightmare.

'We watched our
 little fighter go through hell but she fought all she could to the very
 last second.'

While Layla's parents do not blame the health centre for her death, they are seeking answers. Mrs watt said: 'We don't want anyone else to be faced with this. It was the last thing anybody would ever have expected to have to such a young person.'

Over 600 people attended Layla's funeral and gathered at Cambusnethan cemetery on May 3.

Margaret added: 'The past few months have just been overwhelming. Somehow Layla knew she had cancer, but she tried to be strong for everyone else.

'It all happened so fast, we don’t know 
if anything else could have been done. But we do feel we need some 
answers, so that we can gain some closure and properly start grieving.

Layla's mother (centre) as well as Layla's friends and family recently ran the Race for Life to raise money for research into cancer

'Our family have had to go through this and we don’t want anyone else to be faced with this. It was the last thing anybody would ever have expected to have to such a young person.

'Now we want to urge parents to really listen to their children. Even Bobby and I feel we overlooked Layla’s symptoms but we are not medical people.

'We should have pushed more, went back to the doctors and insisted.'

Doctors at the hospital told the family that they had never seen a case like Layla’s because she was so young.

Bowel cancer is typically seen in older men but numbers of the deadly disease have risen by 120 per cent in the past ten years.

Layla repeatedly visited Wishaw Health Centre to get help for her upsetting symptoms but doctors overlooked the possibility of cancer because the media studies student was so young

More than 60 of Layla's friends and family ran the Glasgow 5K Race for Life in her honour last month to raise money for Cancer Research.

Margaret said: 'We have already collected £4500 for Cancer Research with more money still to come in.

'It was a good day and is for a very worthwhile cause. Layla would have liked it as all her friends did it.'

A spokeswoman for Wishaw Health Centre said: 'This is a very tragic case and our thoughts are with Layla's family at this difficult time.

'We would encourage them to get in touch with us if they want to discuss their concerns further.'
