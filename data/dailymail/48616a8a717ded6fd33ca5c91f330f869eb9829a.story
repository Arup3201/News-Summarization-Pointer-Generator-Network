An assistant principal at a public high school in Manhattan who was caught secretly changing his son's grades has been fined by the city's Conflict of Interest Board.

Abdurrahim Ali, who worked at Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School, changed 11 of his son’s exam and course grades from failing to passing between June 2012 and January 2013.

He is being fined $7,000.

Abdurrahim Ali used his administrator's password to change his son's grades 11 times in less than one year

Ali, who began working for the New York City Department of Education in 1989 and is currently not assigned to a school, used his administrator’s password to log into the school’s grading program.

His son attended Bread and Roses from 2009 to 2013. 

A Department of Education spokeswoman said that, 'Mr. Ali abused his position, and has been disciplined for his inappropriate actions. The DOE is committed to swiftly addressing any improper behavior in our classrooms, to ensure that we are delivering a high-quality education to all our students.'

According to The Wall Street Journal, he made $104,437 last year.

In his signed deposition, Ali stated that,'Despite a Bread and Roses policy requiring that grade change requesters fill out and sign handwritten grade change forms for all grade changes, I did not fill out any such forms for the changes I made to my son’s grades.'

Dr. Rodney Lofton, the current principal at Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School, had no comment on the situation.

Currently, 512 students attend the school, located in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood.
