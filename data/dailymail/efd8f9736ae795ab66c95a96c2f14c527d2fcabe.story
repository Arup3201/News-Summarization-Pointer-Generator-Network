Reality show: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe

Robert Mugabe has mocked Tony Blair during a television interview, saying: ‘We call him Bliar’.

Appearing on a  reality show, the 89-year-old Zimbabwe despot said he 
could trust Margaret Thatcher, but ‘it was a different story with the 
Labour party and Blair’.

He added: ‘You couldn’t compare them to Thatcher and the others . . . oh, who can ever believe what Mr Blair says?’

The comments come during a sycophantic, two-and-a-half-hour television 
interview conducted inside Zimbabwe’s opulent State House.

Mugabe wore a formal suit and tie as he dined with his 47-year-old wife 
Grace and two of their children, with silver cutlery on a spotless white
 tablecloth.

Thanks to Mugabe’s chaotic and corrupt rule, three quarters of  the population live on less than  £1 a day.

The dictator’s family use their television appearance to declare their 
love for one another, to discuss philosophy and to laugh about the time 
Grace punched a British photographer in the face.

Grace Mugabe said of her 2009 assault on Richard Jones in Hong Kong: ‘I 
ran after him and I caught him. I started beating him. He was pleading 
with me . . . I didn’t answer so I kept on punching him.’

At one point South African interviewer Dali Tambo – who describes Mugabe
 as ‘warm, charismatic and very humorous’ on camera – asks Mugabe what 
attracted him to Grace, a former typist with whom he started an affair 
while his first wife Sally was terminally ill.

Mugabe blinks, as if holding back tears, and says: ‘Although it might 
have appeared cruel, I said to myself well, it’s not just myself needing
 children . . . my mother has all the time said “Am I going to die 
without seeing grandchildren?”

‘So I decided to make love to her. She happened to be one of the nearest
 and she was a divorcee herself. And so it was.’

Asked what Sally 
thought of his infidelity, Mugabe replies: ‘I did tell her and she just 
kept quiet and said “fine”.’

After claiming he could trust Margaret 
Thatcher (pictured left with Sir Dennis Thatcher, saying goodbye to the Mugabes in 1982), the 89 year old says '[It] was a different story with the 
Labour party and Blair (right)

The People of the South programme is to be broadcast in South Africa 
tomorrow, just over a month before Zimbabwe’s planned presidential 
election.

Despite this, the programme makes no mention of the country’s main opposition party, The Movement for Democratic Change.
