Police in Washington have been caught on tape letting their fellow officers off the hook for speeding - because they were running late for a conference.

A lengthy recording by a regular driving listening in on the police scanner picks up the cops spotting patrol cars roaring down a 60mph freeway at speeds as high as 86mph - then laughing it off.

The conversation took place between ground-based officers and a Washington State Patrol plane running a speed trap on Highway 2 near Wenatchee, around three hours east of Seattle.

Coming up behind you: Blogger Bill Gillam filmed a police car approaching him from behind then roaring past - around the same time State Patrol officers were chatting about not taking action against speeding police

Double standard: Officers over the radio could be heard laughing off the officers' speeding. One patrol car was going at 86mph on Highway 2 near Wenatchee, Washington

 

At first the airborne officer spots a white car overtaking traffic but doesn't clock the speed until he works out 'whether we want it or not', the video.

The footage, uploaded to YouTube by blogger Bill Gillam, then records a second officer being clocked at 86mph - 26mph over the stated 60mph limit for the stretch.

But, rather than take action, the two officers chuckle to one another and describe the car roaring down the highway as a 'pretty good one'.

As more and more officers speed by it dawns on the two that they are all headed to a drugs conference in nearby Chelan - which starts at midday. The footage was recorded around 10.30am.

The airborne officer, nervous about the speeds, seems to suggest taking action at one point.

'Late for conference': The officers joke over the airways about mentioning the speeding to the officers themselves - but concede it wouldn't make them many friends

He tells his colleague: 'I don't know if it matters or not but all the ones I'm not calling the speeds at have been over 80.'

But the response bats away the prospect of issuing any tickets - as would happen to normal motorists - and said that the issue could result in 'a little announcement to slow down next time' at the conference.

Even though later in the video one motorcyclist's behavior is described as 'unsafe' when he overtakes somebody at 72mph, the officers seem more concerned the prospect of being unpopular than taking any action.

When it is suggested that officer in the plane fly to the conference and confront the speeding officers, he jokes: 'I'm sure I'd make lots of friends.'

The Washington State Patrol has admitted the video, dated October 8, is legitimate.

After the double-standard emerged, the department also said it would void any tickets issued to motorists over the two-day period of the conference, KIRO-TV reported.

Spokesman Bob Calkins said: 'Typically we don't stop what we know to be a police vehicle because they could be on their way to an emergency that we don't know about'.

The KVI radio station reported that he said: 'We learned about the video and we understand how it would make people fee. If they're not going to an emergency they should obey that the rest of us obey.'
