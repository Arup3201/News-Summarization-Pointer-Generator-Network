A couple posted selfies to Facebook in a car they stole from a pastor after gunning him down, police have said.

Lashonda Williams, 24, and Roger Reed Jr., 23, allegedly shot Reverend Don Smith on the side of the road in Hickory Hill, Tennessee on November 1 before stealing his 2010 Buick Lacrosse.

They drove more than 150 miles back home to Greenville, Mississippi, where they were caught four days after the heinous murder, MyFoxMemphis reported.

But while on the journey, the apparently had plenty of time to snap multiple kissing and grinning selfies and post them to their Facebook profiles.

No remorse: Lashonda Williams, 24, and Roger Reed Jr., 23, allegedly took these photographs inside a car after killing its owner and going on a joyride for more than 150 miles. They have now both been arrested

Caught: They allegedly killed a pastor on November 1 but were tracked down in Mississippi on November 5

'It just shows how egregious this crime is, you know, that some people, their conscience doesn't bother them,' Greenville Assistant Chief of Police Delando Wilson said.

'They have been suspected of a heinous crime. To joyride in the victim's vehicle is pretty heartless.'

The couple, who claim to be married on their Facebook profiles, have been charged with first-degree murder and aggravated robbery. Williams also appears to be the mother of young children.

They were caught on November 5 following a brief chase and attempting to leave the car on foot.  

Killed: Reverend Don Smith, who had been a pastor of a Memphis Baptist church for 30 years, was found next to a pond in Hickory Hill, Tennessee. His family believes he had offered his help before he was robbed

They remain behind bars and are awaiting extradition back to Memphis.

Relatives of the victim say they don't recognize the couple and believe that he might have been shot and robbed after offering to help them. 

'The only thing I can see is my daddy trying to help someone in the middle of the night which is something he would do that,' his daughter Whitney Smith told Fox.

'The kind of person he was, people might have thought he was naive because helps everyone even if he shouldn't.'

His wallet was also stolen, police said.

Reverend Smith, 57, had been the pastor of Prospect Park Baptist Church for nearly 30 years and was going to celebrate the milestone later this month.

He was laid to rest one week after his death and leaves behind a wife and daughters.

'As a family we're already forgiving this person, but we want justice served,' relative Raymond Jones told WREG.

Two days after his son was arrested, Roger Reed Sr. expressed his sympathies for the slain man.

'Please say a prayer for Pastor Don Smith,' he wrote. 'I'm hurting right now mentally physically emotionally....'
