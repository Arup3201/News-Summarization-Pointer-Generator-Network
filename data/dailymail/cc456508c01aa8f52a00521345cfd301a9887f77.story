Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie joined Stoke three days before the transfer window shut in a player-exchange deal which saw Kenwyne Jones head the other way to Cardiff. He scored his first goal for the Potters, his third Premier League club, in last weekend's 2-2 draw with Southampton. Before you read his second Footballers' Football Column, check out his video…

In football you have to be ready to make changes quickly and that has happened to me. I have moved from Cardiff to Stoke and this is a new chance to make a mark, to show what I can do. 

I like what I am seeing so far. I have only been here a short time but already it feels comfortable and I’m happy.

The gaffer, Mark Hughes, is a man I like working with. His team talks, before and during matches, are very good. He is a passionate man who knows how to get a point across. He doesn’t join in with training too much, but every now and then the ball will come near him and he’ll do something – he can still hit a great volley!

I also like his tactics. We are playing some very good football and doing well, even if the Premier League is crazy this year. It is extremely competitive. But the manager has been calm about it. He knows what he wants us to do and we are doing it.

When you have that clear idea of what a manager wants it makes changing team much easier. I scored against Southampton and that helps too – it’s always important to get going fast.

The style of football is important. I must admit I was frustrated at Cardiff. I enjoyed being there, with a really nice group of players and good people as well. But the style of football under Malky Mackay was not really right for me. It was effective in the Championship but not in the Premier League.

We played a lot of long balls and sometimes we didn’t really have wingers. As a striker, you can get isolated that way. 

The spirit in the team was excellent, though. I stay in touch with Steven Caulker by text and I look forward to seeing the boys when we go there to play in April. But that is football. Things change and you move on.

For me, football is always more important than just liking a place. I wanted to move on for the sake of my football. 

There is a hassle that goes with it that maybe people do not understand. You go through the process of leaving a place, finding a new home, getting settled in.

Luckily for me, my wife is very supportive. Her and I and our baby have moved into a small apartment for now and we will move into our old house in the summer.

I still have a house in the Midlands from my time at West Brom and there is a player on loan currently living there. We’ll move in during the summer. My wife is expecting another boy in June so it is an exciting time for our family.

Stoke is probably a better fit for me in a football sense. We play the ball to feet more, which is great for me. And more often than not I am playing off someone, rather than being the target myself. It suits my game more. It creates more shooting chances and that is what every striker wants.

I hadn’t had a proper shooting chance in a while before the Sunderland game so to get that sight of goal and then to score felt great. These things matter to a striker. 

The whole place feels good right now. Stoke have this brilliant training ground, and that is good when you are a player. It is where you go to work every day. And the medical team is very good, very professional.

When I arrived, I was having cramps at first because I had not been playing 90 minutes – I had been getting taken off in games at Cardiff. Now I am feeling sharper and up to speed again.

The Premier League has been crazy so far. I have been around it for quite a long time and I have not seen it quite like this before. Normally, you have some idea of who is going to win and who is going to go down. 

There are maybe a couple of teams in the top half of the table who look like they will stay where they are. The other 18 are moving all the time. It is intense.

A few weeks ago you would have looked at the table and thought Crystal Palace and Sunderland were going down. Now look at them. New managers have come in and totally changed their circumstances.

Then you have Fulham, who were struggling quite badly and then they get a draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford. It is hard to say what will happen.

The top of the table is more exciting than it has been for years. As a player, you find it quite stressful but also very exciting. There is so much on every game. Even now, at the start of February, it feels like the games mean so much.

If you go four or five games without winning you are going to be in huge trouble. If you go four or five games without losing, you will jump up the table. I think this next month will be crucial.
