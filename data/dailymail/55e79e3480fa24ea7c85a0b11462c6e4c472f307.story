More than 1,000 mourners clogged Brussels' main basilica to pay their last respects on Tuesday to Belgium youth international and Wolfsburg midfielder Junior Malanda, who died in a car crash last week.

Among the attendees, many of whom wore Wolfsburg colors, were Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking and manager Klaus Allofs.

Malanda was a back-seat passenger when the driver of the SUV lost control and the vehicle skidded off a slippery highway 10 days ago and overturned several times. Malanda, aged 20, was pronounced dead on the spot.

Malanda had Congolese roots, and the service included several African songs and dances.

According to reports in Germany, the Belgium Under 21 international died after the car he was a passenger in crashed on a motorway near Porta Westfalica in north west Germany on Saturday afternoon.

Bild said the two other people in the vehicle had been taken to hospital with serious injuries after the car left the road and crashed into a tree amid heavy rain and wind.

Malanda, who joined the Bundesliga club from Belgian side Zulte Waregem in 2013, had reportedly been due to fly to South Africa on Saturday night for Wolfsburg's winter training camp.

The 20-year-old was seen as one of the brightest young prospects coming out of Belgium
