The ex-wife of Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has taken out a billboard-sized advert promoting her new gym - just over the road from his head office.

Joanne McCue Bannatyne is also pictured on the eye-catching poster, which includes the slogan 'Welcome Your New Neighbours'.

It is plainly visible from Bannatyne's office window in his HQ next to Bannatyne's Health Club in Darlington.

Ms McCue Bannatyne, 47, whose divorce from the self-made millionaire was finalised earlier this year, opened her rival CrossFit gym in May at the former Darlington FC stadium, now home to Darlington Mowden Park Rugby Club.

She declined to comment on whether the wording of the advert, which features a group shot of the CrossFit team, was designed to be provoke her former husband.

However, she said: 'This was where we could get the advertising space in Darlington, it is one of the two main routes into the town and hoardings are quite hard to come by.

'Whether or not it's controversial, it picks up people driving into Darlington from Teesside.'

The couple announced they were separating in 2011, five years after they were married. Bannatyne had proposed to the then Miss McCue during a holiday in Barbados.

Their break-up was particularly 
acrimonious. After his wealth was valued at £430m in the Sunday 
Times Rich List, Ms McCue Bannatyne reportedly demanded he pay her 
£1,000 per day, plus payments for their two children, a house in the UK and holiday home in France.

Bannatyne famously took to Twitter, where he now has more than 630,000 followers, and branded his then wife a 'gold digger'.

But the divorce hit the former Royal Navy sailor hard, and in another tweet he threatened to 
take his own life, saying: 'My day could not have been worse. Suicide is
a considered option.'

The comments were later removed.

Bannatyne operates more than 60 clubs across the country under the Bannatyne Health Club banner and has more than 180,000 members, according to its website.

Last year the Sunday Times Rich List 
estimated his wealth to be £85m, considerably less than the disputed 
£430m, which Mr Bannatyne had claimed was one of the reasons for their 
divorce.

In May this year it emerged Bannatyne was repaying debts of £122m - money he borrowed from Anglo Irish Bank to buy 24 fitness clubs from Hilton Group in 2006.

The bank later collapsed and Bannatyne was forced to hire a team of legal and financial experts to negotiate the terms of his repayments with administrators KPMG.

Earlier today a spokeswoman for the 64-year-old declined to comment on the latest twist.

However, Bannatyne - who is starring in a new series of Dragons Den, which began on Sunday - spoke about the divorce from his former wife in a recent interview with the Daily Express.

He said: 'Relations could not be worse. She's angry with me, but I still don't know why because she won't speak to me.

'I'm still in love with her, but she hates me.'

It is not the first time a rival fitness business has utilised the advertising space directly outside Bannatyne's.

When Lifestyle Fitness, in Eastmount Road, opened last year, it took out an advert on the same billboard.
