Arrested bride: Bernadette Catan-Keeler was arrested on Sunday morning for allegedly beating and biting her husband just hours after they were married

Michael Lohan's ex-girlfriend has been arrested for assaulting her new husband just hours after they were married.

Bernadette Catan-Keeler is accused of attacking her new husband Michael Keeler and biting his shoulder. She was arrested Sunday morning in Point Lighthouse, Florida, and charged with domestic battery.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, Mr 
Keeler told police his new bride attacked him at a hotel and then later 
at their home in Lighthouse Point.

At the end of March, Lohan - father of troubled starlet Lindsay Lohan - told RadarOnline.com that he had started dating Bernadette, who he said was a nurse he had met at the beach in Florida.

He told the website she was a 'down to earth person who hates tabloids!'

He added: 'She is smart, doesn't drink or smoke and is in great shape'.

This despite the fact that one of the photos Mr Lohan posted online of the couple shows the woman holding what appears to be a pack of cigarettes.

Police say the Keelers got married on Saturday, then stayed that night at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale.

The happy new couple went to a nightclub to celebrate, but things quickly turned sour.

Mr Keeler told police he saw his new wife dancing with another man, so he left the nightclub and returned to the hotel. He said his wife followed him back shortly after, and that she was drunk.

He claimed she then pushed him and bit him on his left shoulder.

Mr Keeler said he drove home to the house in Lighthouse Point he shared with Mrs Catan-Keeler.

When she got there, she allegedly ripped off his shirt, threw water at him and bit him on his right arm.

Same woman? In March, Michael Lohan posted this picture to Twitter of himself with Bernadette, who appears to be Mrs Catan-Keeler. He said she 'doesn't smoke or drink', though she is holding cigarettes

At around 8:30 a.m. Sunday, two police officers approached the house after getting a 911 call from there.

The officers said they saw a shirtless Mike Keeler through a window, holding a cellphone and holding down his wife, who was yelling for help.

Mrs Catan-Keeler allegedly claimed the bite mark on her husband's shoulder came from kinky play, while the bite mark on his arm was delivered after he pushed her into a wall.

Mr Keeler has said he doesn't want his wife to go to jail, and he appeared at her bond hearing Monday to ask for leniency. He said she may have been under the influence of drugs.

It's unclear if Mrs Catan-Keeler is actually a nurse.

Her bond was set at $4,500.

'Finally a down to earth person who hates tabloids!' Mr Lohan said. He also told reporters he had met her on the beach in Florida

Broward County Judge John 'Jay' Hurley said: 'For newlyweds, this is not starting things off on the right foot, for sure.

'I hope this is a small bump in the road and you two can iron it all out and have a nice long life together'.

In March, Michael Lohan had his own trouble with the law, even before he posted steamy pictures online of him and then-Miss Catan.

Mr Lohan was arrested in West Hollywood, California after a previous girlfriend, Kate Major, filed a police report against him, claiming he'd assaulted her.

The Los Angeles District Attorney filed a misdemeanor charge of 'inflicting injury on a Cohabitant' against him.
