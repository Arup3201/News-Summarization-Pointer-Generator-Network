A cup of tea, fast internet connection and a trustworthy best friend are some of the bare necessities of modern life, according to a survey.

The top 20 things Britons cannot live without also includes television, the iPhone, the family car and, for some, spectacles.

Researchers compiled the list following a study carried out among 2,000 adults aged between 18 and 65. A daily shower and central heating also appear, as do a glass of wine and a pint.

A glass of wine was one of the items on the list of things that Britons cannot do without

The list revealed that more than one-third of us would struggle to cope without an ‘I love you’ every now and then, while the same percentage want cuddles and a solid marriage.

A full English breakfast, coffee and chocolate also made the list, as did a night in on the sofa and a good cry every now and then.

The poll was conducted to mark the forthcoming Blu-ray release of the 1967 Disney classic The Jungle Book, which features the song The Bare Necessities.

For one in 20 people surveyed, life wouldn’t be complete without a foreign holiday once a year.

And while women place cuddles as their number one ‘bare necessity’, men are more firmly attached to their television. For women, chocolate, a best friend, the heating and a cup of tea are all of high importance. But for men, it is a full fry-up, football and sausages.

And while one-third of men can’t live without a pint of beer, only 7 per cent of women agree.

Four in ten people admit until they had an iPhone they had no idea what a necessity it was, while 34 per cent say the same about their car, and 33 per cent about their spouse.

Despite not wanting to live without their phone, television or car, 77 per cent of Britons claim every material item is replaceable. And 86 per cent believe people are guilty of overlooking the essential things in life such as love and friendship in favour of material things.

For six in ten people, the bare necessities in life have changed as they have got older, with seven in ten claiming they have become less materialistic. But while 33 per cent of people claim they could function without a smartphone, laptop and social networking, 60 per cent would find it frustrating.

The top five bare necessities were an internet connection, followed by television, a cuddle, a trustworthy best friend and a daily shower.
