Port Authority police officers made a special delivery when they helped to deliver a baby girl near the toll booths on the George Washington Bridge.

The bundle of joy was delivered on the upper level of the George Washington bridge  on Saturday morning after a woman went into labor in the back of a taxi cab.

The woman, who has not been named, from Monroe New York had been travelling in a taxi along with her husband towards Manhattan when she felt severe labor pains.

The driver of the taxi then called for medical assistance at 6.33 a.m. for the 36-year-old passenger.

Port Authority Police officers Jason Malice, Steve Pisciotta and Joseph Ponzo, a rookie police officer, responded to the scene.

Police officer Laverne Watson was also on hand to offer her assistance.

As soon as officers arrived, the woman's waters broke and they all helped to deliver the baby girl who dropped into Watson's hands.  

According to a Port Authority spokesman Watson helped to deliver the child and Pisciotta, a trained EMT then clamped and cut the umbilical cord.

'I was a nervous wreck, but mom was fine,' Watson told 1010 WINS’ Roger Stern. 

Meanwhile, Pisciotta used an emergency ‘OB Kit’ he had in his medical bag which he always carries on patrol and had everything necessary to help out with the unusual birth.

'I clamped the cord in two spots,' Pisciotta said. 

'I cut the umbilical cord in the middle, wrapped the baby up.'
