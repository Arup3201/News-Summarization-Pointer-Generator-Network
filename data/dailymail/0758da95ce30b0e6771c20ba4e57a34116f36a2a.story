Hillary Clinton, who has in past had trouble talking about her wealth and life experiences, is intensifying an effort to  humanize herself to likely voters. 

Clinton has increasingly made mention of her roles as both a mother and grandmother in remarks, framing her public policies in the context of the hardships she dealt with while raising only child Chelsea and the hopes and fears she has about the world her granddaughter Charlotte will inhabit.

During a Tuesday speech in Silicon Valley, her first in the U.S. this year, Clinton indulged in self-deprecating humor. She casually joked about being overweight at the conference targeting women and teased that she might have a hoarding problem.

The much sought after public speaker earned an estimated $300,000, according to the New York Times, for her keynote at the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women on Tuesday, where  attendees paid $245 a ticket to listen to Clinton and other female leaders. 

Clinton had been unusually quiet in the last several months before the Santa Clara, California, speech as she interviewed potential managers for her expected presidential campaign and revised her message. 

She'll make several appearances next week, however, at an Emily's LIST gala in Washington, D.C. and a dinner for her family's non-profit, the Clinton Foundation, and she'll participate in a Clinton Foundation event for students in Miami next weekend. 

Back in the spotlight on Tuesday, Clinton continued to play coy about her campaign rollout, telling interviewer Kara Swisher, co-executive editor of Re/code, that she would make a decision about her political future 'in good time.'

'I am obviously talking to a lot of people, thinking [it] through,' Clinton said, according to NBC News. 'Because here's my view on this, Kara: I just think that we have so many big issues we have to deal with that unless we can really come together and have a national conversations about those issues, we're not going to make the progress we need.'

Playing to her audience Clinton stated that 'in many ways the economy is still operating like it's 1955,' and chastised men who ignore women's issues, saying to themselves, 'Act like you’re listening and this too shall pass.'

'I think we all cheered at Patricia Arquette's speech at the Oscars—because she's right, it's time to have wage equality once and for all,' she said, utilizing pop culture reference to make her point. about the wage gap between men and women.

While advocating for paid leave for new mothers Clinton revealed that she waited to have a discussion with her own employer while pregnant with daughter Chelsea.

Clinton worked at a law firm at the time, where she was a partner - the first female at the the firm to hold the title. 'I just kept getting bigger,' she said of how long it took her to broach the subject, according to San Jose Mercury news reporter Julia Love, who was present at the 'Lead On' event, which was not broadcast.

The former first lady attempted to empathize with conference goers and showcase her own struggles with everyday issues while talking about her weight. 'You can tell I’m not doing Fitbit,' she said, referring to a popular wristwatch pedometer

The former first lady again attempted to empathize with conference goers, and showcase her own struggles with everyday issues, while talking about her weight.

'You can tell I’m not doing Fitbit,' she said, referring to a popular wristwatch pedometer.

And when asked by Swisher whether she's an Android or Apple user, Clinton delicately sidestepped the question by again poking fun at herself. Clinton said she has an iPhone and a Blackberry. 

'I don’t throw anything away,' she said. 'I’m like two steps short of a hoarder.'

When it comes to serious matters such as foreign policy, Clinton's relied heavily on tenure as Secretary of State, during which time she traveled more often and to more countries than any of her predecessors, to convey an auro of  astuteness.

Former Hewlett Packer executive Carly Fiorina, the only female Republican known to be seriously considering a presidential campaign in 2016, sunk her teeth into the talking point on Tuesday while speaking at an Atlanta, Georgia, luncheon, telling the event's Republican audience that frequent flyer miles don't count in presidential campaigns.

'Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,' Fiorina said, per an Associated Press report. 'But unlike Hillary Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.'
