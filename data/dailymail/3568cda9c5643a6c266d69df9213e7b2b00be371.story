Admission: The captain of the stricken cruise ship Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, told his bosses on the night of the disaster: 'I have messed up'

The captain of the stricken Costa Concordia reassured coastguards that he would be the last to leave the cruise ship, a new recording has revealed.

But Captain Francesco Schettino did not keep his promise and ended up fleeing the vessel while passengers were still on board.

Schettino, 52, who is under house arrest facing charges of abandoning ship and multiple manslaughter, promised coastguards that he would be the last person off the ship - minutes before he fled in a lifeboat, leaving hundreds of passengers on board.

In
the recording, released by Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, an official
asks Schettino whether everyone is going to abandon ship. Sounding 
breathless, the captain replies: ‘I’m going to stay here.’

The coastguard asks again: ‘So only you are going to stay there?’

Schettino replies: ‘I’m the only one who will stay here.’

Signing
off, the coastguard says:  ‘Very good, Captain. Continue with the 
evacuation and we’ll speak later. Keep your mobile with you.’

In
another tape recording released last week, an exasperated Gregorio De 
Falco, head of the local coastguard, ordered Schettino back to his ship 
to co-ordinate the rescue.

The captain later told investigators he ‘tripped and fell’ into a lifeboat.

It has also been revealed Schettino made a frantic telephone call to a senior company executive just after the incident.

Sources said he told Roberto Ferrarini, Costa Cruises’ operations manager: ‘I’ve messed up. We have touched the bottom [of the sea]. I am telling you the truth. We sailed past Giglio and we took a hit.’

Sources say the captain’s call was made 23 minutes after the liner ran aground, tearing a gaping 230ft hole in its hull.

Twenty people are still missing and the number of people dead has risen to 12. The body of a woman was found by divers on Saturday in a submerged corridor on the fourth deck of the  £372 million vessel.

The
victim – who was wearing a lifejacket – was taken to the island of 
Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, where the Concordia hit rocks nine 
days ago.

Investigators say Schettino sailed the Concordia to within 800ft of Giglio when it should have been at least five miles away in open sea.

Prosecutors claim the captain  was on an unauthorised course to perform a ‘salute’ to islanders.

In legal documents forming part of the case against Schettino, the father-of-one confirmed that 30  minutes before the tragedy he had dined in the ship’s exclusive Club restaurant with Moldovan blonde  Domnica Cemortan.

At the time of the impact at 9.42pm last Friday, Schettino said that Ms Cemortan, 25, was ‘in a side room’ close to the bridge.

He added: ‘All of a sudden I saw foam on the surface of the water off the bow of the ship. I knew immediately it was a reef that had not shown up on the radar.’

Despite having become the most reviled man in Italy, the captain has won support among some people in his hometown, Meta di Sorrento, near Naples.

One sign written on  a bedsheet and attached to a wall declared: ‘Captain, don’t give up.’

One woman, who declined to be identified, said: ‘The poor thing – everyone is against him, really against him. I feel sorry for him.’

Yesterday, Schettino’s wife, Fabiola Russo, left the couple’s home  and was driven off by a friend.
