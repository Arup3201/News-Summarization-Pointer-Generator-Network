It is the rolling countryside that inspired John Constable's most celebrated works, including his masterpiece - The Hay Wain.

But residents fear that 'Constable country' is under threat because of a proposed development which could bring 160 houses to the small Suffolk village where the landscape painter was born.

Developers have put forward plans for a mix of 50 affordable homes, 94 town houses and several apartments on the outskirts of East Bergholt.

The homes would be built just over a mile from Flatford, where Constable painted The Hay Wain in 1821 as well as The Leaping Horse and The Lock.

Constable recognised that his primary inspiration was the landscape surrounding Dedham Vale and once said: 'I should paint my own places best'.

Residents are determined to protect the artist's legacy and have raised concerns that the great artist may have sketched the fields where the homes could be built.

Patricia Wright, secretary of the East Bergholt Society, told The Times: 'We don't want a big development dumped down on a corner of the village. We would like a modest number of small developments.'

'Constable wrote, 'Those scenes made me a painter and I am grateful.' So are we, and we are determined that his legacy will not be lost on our watch.'

Up to 160 homes could be built at the site in  East Bergholt (shaded red area) - just over a mile from Flatford Mill, where Constable painted the Hay Wain

This is the spot from which Constable set up his easel to make preliminary sketches for The Hay Wain (pictured today)

She conceded that the fields were on the opposite side of the village to Flatford Mill but said that they still deserved to be protected.

The village sits within the Dedham Vale and Stour Valley - an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is 20 minutes from Ipswich.

Developers Bidwells and Knight Developments have not yet submitted a planning application, as they are waiting for the results of a survey.

'Once all the views are taken into account we will submit the application to Babergh District Council,' said the developers.

Peter Dent, of the campaign group Action East Bergholt, said: 'We are not against development totally but 144 homes in one hit is absurd.'

Constable completed The Hay Wain in 1821 and nearly 200 years on, you can still stand at the exact spot where he set up his easel beside the River Stour at Flatford. 

The painting was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, but failed to find a buyer.

But when it was exhibited in France, with other paintings by Constable, the artist was awarded a Gold Medal by Charles X.

For many years the Flatford site has been in the hands of the National Trust, which organises 'Constable Country' tours of Flatford and the surrounding countryside.

The Mill was once owned by John Constable's father and the artist made the surrounding  area the subject of many of his works. 

Constable was largely self-taught, but became a student at the Royal Academy schools at the age of 24.

He exhibited from 1802 at the Royal Academy in London and later at the Paris Salon and influenced the Barbizon School and the French Romantic movement. 

Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, Constable was never financially successful. 

He did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52.

Another one of his most famous works is The Leaping Horse (pictured) once described by Lucian Freud as 'the greatest painting in the world'
