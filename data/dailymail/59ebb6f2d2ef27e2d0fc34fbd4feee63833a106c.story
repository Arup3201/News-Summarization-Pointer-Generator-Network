The paralysed have been offered a ray of hope after British scientists used light to move and control frozen muscles.

Experts from University College London and King’s College London made the breakthrough during stem cell research.

The work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again.

Experts from University College London and King's College London made the breakthrough during stem cell research. The work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again.

In the shorter term, it could help sufferers of motor neurone disease, which leads to the gradual paralysis of muscles, including those that control breathing and swallowing.

Paralysis occurs when motor neurons – specialised nerve cells that relay messages from the brain – become damaged, so the researchers set about replacing them.

They began with embryonic stem cells, or ‘chameleon cells’, capable of turning into every tissue in the body.

They inserted a gene into the cells that made them sensitive to light and then turned them into motor neurons.

These designer cells were then transplanted into mice, where they grew and connected with paralysed muscles.

Crucially, when light was shone on them, the muscles moved, the journal Science reports. The researchers now want to create an implant that emits light as needed.

UCL researcher Professor Linda Greensmith said: ‘A lot of patients live in fear suffocating to death because they can’t breathe or choking to death because they can’t swallow.’ 

She hopes the first test operations in motor neurone disease patients could start within five years.

The breakthrough also offers hope to those left wheelchair-bound by car crashes and other accidents.However, the need to make dozens of muscles walk again means this is a more distant dream.
