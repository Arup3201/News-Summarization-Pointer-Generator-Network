Drowned to death: Ruhshona Kurbonova, only four-years-old, was found dead in the pond at Prospect Park, in Brooklyn

The body of a 2-year-old girl was pulled from a lake in a popular Brooklyn park after her parents reported her missing.

Ruhshona Kurbonova was found dead Saturday just before 6.00 p.m. by divers after a frantic five-hour search of Prospect Park that involved divers and helicopters, police said.

The girl and her four-year-old brother were playing near the lake when they both fell in, witnesses told the New York Post.

The boy was pulled to safety before disappearing into the pond's murky depths, which police said offer zero visibility. Another police source told the paper the bottom of the lake is like quicksand.

Officers combed the 585-acre park handing out missing person's fliers while divers searched the murky lake and a police helicopter hovered above.

Kurbonova's brother was eventually reunited with her mother, who held out hope the young girl would be found alive but then collapsed in grief when told of her daughter's fate, according to the Post.

Another source told the New York Daily News the woman had to be taken away on a stretcher.

Uncle Dekzod Isokov told the Post the two siblings disappeared while the family was grilling shish kabobs on the radiant afternoon.

They just left,' he said. 'They walked off and we didn’t know.'

Another witness, Angela Peterson, told the paper she saw who she believed to be the pair's older brother running though the park shouting in another language as the mother frantically trailed after him.

'I heard the mother say, ‘Oh my god! Oh my god!’ She was so distraught,' Peterson recalled.

A group in the park for a church picnic said a few good samaritans who pulled Kurbonova's brother out of the lake brought the algae-covered boy to them asking if he was theirs.

'They kept asking people, ‘Is this your son?’ until the family said, ‘That’s my son,’ and then asked if they found a little girl with him,' one of the picnic-goers said.

A person called 911 saying a woman approached her shouting 'my babies!

'She didn’t speak much English,' the caller said. 'The mother was in a terrible shock — that feeling when you lose something and you go numb. I know the park like the back of my hand but for a child…it’s almost like a maze, a game.'
