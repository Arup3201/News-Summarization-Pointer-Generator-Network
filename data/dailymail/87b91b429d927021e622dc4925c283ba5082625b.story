British actress Julie Walters has waded into the class row between popstar James Blunt and Labour MP Chris Bryant

Julie Walters has claimed that working-class children 'aren't represented' in the arts.

The Hollywood actress, who was honoured with a BAFTA fellowship last year, branded it 'really sad' that youngsters from privileged backgrounds were enjoying all the breaks.

The 64-year-old star of Mamma Mia, Harry Potter and Calendar Girls, appears to back the argument of the Shadow arts minister, Chris Bryant.

The Labour MP claimed British culture was 'dominated' by stars like Blunt and Eddie Redmayne who went to expensive boarding schools.

Harrow educated Blunt hit back calling the politician a 'classist gimp,' and 'prejudiced wazzock' who was using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes. 

'Working-class kids aren't represented,' Mrs Walters said in an interview with the Guardian Weekend magazine.

'It's really sad.

'I think it means that  we're going to get loads more middle-class drama.

'It will be middle-class people playing working-class people, like it used to be.' 

Mrs Walters, whose grew up in Staffordshire with her builder father and clerical assistant mother, was awarded a 'full grant' to study at Manchester Polytechnic. 

But she said she would fail to make it today because she would not be able to go to college.

After finishing college Walters went onto start her career at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, working with the likes of Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell in working-class drama.

'I don't know how you get into it now,' Ms Walter, who was Oscar-nominated for her turn, opposite Michael Caine, in the 1983 film Educating Rita, told the newspaper magazine.

She said that she doesn't 'know what to tell,' the kids that write to her asking for advice to break into acting.  

Mrs Walters, who won a BAFTA in 2010 for her performance as Mo Mowlam in Channel 4's Mo, reportedly said it was not just a problem for actors, but also writers. 

In his letter to Mr Bryant, Blunt claimed that the £30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry.

The  Brit award-winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh.

Blunt opened his letter to Mr Bryant by accusing him of being a 'classist gimp', despite the fact that the Labour MP himself was privately educated at £20,000 a year Cheltenham College before attending Oxford.

In Blunt's letter, he wrote: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.'

He added: 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend.

'No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.'

 Blunt said even in the army, which he joined after university, he was told that trying to become a pop star was a 'mad idea'.

He wrote: 'And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian).

'Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry.' 

He added: 'You come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance.

'But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my s*** songs, and my plummy accent.

'I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my a*** off.

'What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and 'level the playing field'.

'Perhaps what you've failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-'G'-from-'GB' thinking, which is to look at others' success and say, 'it's not fair'.'

Blunt signed off his letter: 'Up yours.'

But Mr Bryant accused the pop star of being 'blooming precious'.

In a letter in response, the MP wrote: 'I'm not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I'm not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen.

'If you'd read the whole of my interview, you'd have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you.

'But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.'
