This is an excellent time to plant a hedge. Spring is close and if you get your plants into the ground by mid-March, they'll enjoy the maximum number of growing days in their first year.

Hedges are valuable in so many ways. Functionally, they make better windbreaks than walls and can muffle sound. You can use them to improve privacy, create enclosures, act as backdrops or mask unsightly objects.

Hedges also make lovely features. Deciduous, evergreen, flowering, fruiting — they run through subtle changes with each season. You can plant low-growing ones for bordering paths, prettying up little beds or just to create formal patterns.

Lots of woody plants are suitable for hedging, but some adapt more readily than others. Growth speeds vary, too, but here's a golden rule: never choose plants purely for speed.

Leyland cypress — the fastest — is a terrible choice because it can't produce new shoots from mature branches. So if you cut back an overgrown leyland hedge, you'll be left with permanently hideous naked limbs.

IT HAD TO BE YEW

Yew, on the other hand, is perfect. Even if cut back to a stump, it will grow as a dense bush. Though not speedy, it grows faster than most people expect and thrives in a variety of conditions. What's more, you can trim yew to any size and it needs cutting only once a year.

Holly keeps its shape with a single annual clip and most varieties of common holly are suitable. Those with plain green leaves tend to have more vigour than variegated varieties.

Privet grows much faster, but needs several cuts each year. Elaeagnus x ebbingei makes a fine hedge, too, but Viburnum tinus is an excellent evergreen that flowers through winter. Among deciduous hedging, beech and hornbeam keep their old foliage all winter. Hornbeam copes well with heavy soils, but beech is better for chalky or sandy conditions.

BEAT THE BLIGHT

For little hedges, box has been grown for centuries. It's easy to clip and can be kept tiny, but there's one big drawback — box blight. This serious disease damages mature hedging, so if you're planting new, choose something else.

The small Japanese holly Ilex crenata is an excellent substitute. It's robust, has tiny rounded leaves and clips to any size, even teeny. Choose the variety Green Hedge.

Before planting your hedge, dig a roomy trench that will accommodate roots. To boost fertility, work compost into the trench bottom and mix in a little bonemeal.

With bare-rooted hedging plants, make sure the roots never dry out. Keep them heeled into the ground until your planting trench is ready. Apply a mycorrhizal booster, such as Rootgrow, to ensure rapid establishment. You can buy this from garden centres or online.

Tall plants will need support while they develop their root systems. Use canes or light stakes and tie the main stems gently to these with jute string.

Water newly planted hedges regularly during their first summer, particularly during dry spells. And never allow weeds or grass to grow at the base of the developing hedge.

After planting, I like to trim away as much as a third of the growth. This seems brutal, but will help stimulate new growth. When the young hedge grows back after its first trim, it should do so quickly and with denser branches.

When your hedge is growing well, remove supports. Trim as necessary, making it fractionally wider at the bottom than top. It will take years to develop the dense growth needed for a sound and durable hedge.

At first, there'll be ugly holes, thin zones and an uneven top. But that's normal.

And with regular clipping and a few years' loving care, it will be less like a row of shrubs and more like a proper grown-up hedge.
