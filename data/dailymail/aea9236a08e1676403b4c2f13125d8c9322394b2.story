Plumber Daniel Hickling caused a gas explosion which blew a house off its foundations and injured the owner and his wife

An incompetent workman who caused a gas explosion that blew a mansion off its foundations after botching a simple repair job was today given a suspended jail sentence.

Plumber Daniel Hickling, 32, agreed to cut off and cap two gas pipes at the luxury home in Lincolnshire, despite not being qualified to do the work.

A hole he left in one of the pipes caused a leak that led to an explosion within hours of him finishing work at the detached home in Nettleton, on the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds.

Lincoln Crown Court was told that Hickling, who was not Gas Safe registered and had never been trained in gas work, left the LPG gas supply turned off at the property when he left.

And he failed to carry out a legally required test for leaks before finishing.

Hickling admitted to 'failings' and that he lost concentration while working on the job, but claimed he believed he was working on a water pipe and not a gas pipe.

After hearing evidence Recorder Helen Malcolm QC ruled that the plumbing and heating engineer either knew, or obviously should have known, the pipe carried gas and should not have started the job. 

Hickling was given an 11 month jail 
sentence suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of 
unpaid work and pay £2,000 towards prosecution costs.

The court was told the couple that owned the house, Martyn and Teresa Moody, called in Hickling to bury the gas pipes as part of renovations to convert a former kitchen into a dining room after an extension was added to their home.

The Moodys smelt gas while watching television following their evening meal.

They began searching the property and Mr Moody, out of instinct, flicked on a cigarette lighter while checking one of the rooms. Seconds later the house blew up.

The
blast had such force that the entire building moved an inch. The 
windows and front door were blown out and the ground floor of the home 
was severely damaged. Debris was thrown 100 yards away.

The 63-year-old, who had recently sold his own construction and electrical business, spent two weeks in hospital after he suffered serious burns to his hands, arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts. He has been left scarred for life.

His wife Teresa suffered burns to her legs and feet. She spent two days in hospital before being released.

The house, which was built for the couple in 1993,  had to be completely
rebuilt and the Moodys lived in a caravan for more than a year before 
they were able to move back in.

Mr Moody said 'It was devastating. The house had to be rebuilt. We were 
out of our home for just over a year. We were under-insured. We haven’t 
been paid for our uninsured losses. That was £100,000. It’s not been a 
great year.'

Hickling ,33, of Howsham, Lincolnshire, pleaded guilty to three charges 
relating to the incident in July 2011 but disputed the prosecution case 
that he knew he was working on gas pipes.

He admitted charges of carrying out work to an inappropriate standard, 
carrying out work while not registered with the Gas Safety Register and 
carrying out gas fitting work he was not competent of doing so in breach
of the 1998 Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulation.

Rebuilt: The large detached home, which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993, was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in

Recorder Malcolm told him: 'The work that you did fell far below an acceptable standard and left a very dangerous situation.

'In the event there was a disastrous 
explosion caused by your work. There were considerable and serious 
injuries to both of the Moodys and the total destruction of their house 
and its contents.

'Mr Moody’s comment that it has not been the best year must be one of the understatements of the century.'

James Puzey, prosecuting for the 
Health and Safety Executive, said 'Mr Hickling was incompetent to carry 
out this work and it was carried out incompetently. That led directly to
an explosion which almost destroyed the property and caused serious 
injury to the householders.

'It is incredible that an inexperienced plumbing and heating engineer could mistake gas pipes for water pipes.'

Underinsured: The entrance to the home of Martyn and Teresa Moody

Gareth Weetman, defending, said 
Hickling’s income from his plumbing business had dropped by almost half 
since the explosion and he has built up debts leaving him 'on the brink 
of bankruptcy'.

Speaking after the hearing HSE 
inspector David Butter, who investigated the case,  said: 'Anybody who 
carries out work on gas pipes or appliances without being on the Gas 
Safe Register is breaking the law.

'Daniel Hickling endangered the lives of this couple as soon as he began work. They are extremely lucky to have survived. 

'It is essential that homeowners and 
businesses check gas installers are registered with Gas Safe before 
having work carried out to ensure the job is completed to the required 
safe standard.
