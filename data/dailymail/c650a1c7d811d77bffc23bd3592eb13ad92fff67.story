Jose Mourinho should look to himself and his bosses rather than supporters if he wants to fix the atmosphere problem at Stamford Bridge.

It’s true, the expectation of a comfortable win can breed complacency amongst supporters — but the club’s hierarchy have made it as hard as possible to arrest that slide.

The prices — a problem across English football — have excluded a large number of Chelsea’s traditional fanbase from attending games regularly.

For those who can shell out, anyone believed to be ‘persistently standing’ risks ejection from over-zealous stewards and letters threatening the removal of their season ticket. No cauldron of noise has ever been created by fans being forced to sit down.

The travelling Chelsea support is far more vocal. Away games attract a younger crowd, with a high concentration of people who want to stand and sing. In SW6 those people are dotted all around the ground, making it hard to get an atmosphere going.

It’s a great shame, because when the mood is right Stamford Bridge can really rock, with the crowd so close to the pitch.

Chelsea fans were more vocal in the past - and away from home the support is always louder than the Bridge

Every plea fans have made to the powers that be for standing sections, greater concessions or unreserved seating has fallen on deaf ears.

Mourinho himself greatly exacerbated the problem in his first spell as manager by moving the away fans’ section from behind the dugout.

Opposition supporters are now housed on the other side of the ground to the vocal Matthew Harding Stand, removing opportunity for the back-and-forth so often a catalyst for a lively atmosphere.
