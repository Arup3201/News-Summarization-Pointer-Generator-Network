Supermarkets throughout the UK are selling halal and kosher meat from animals that have not been pre-stunned before having their throats cut.

It recently emerged that British retailers and restaurants are quietly switching to halal meats in their products and meals, leaving customers opposed to the practice - seen by some as causing unnecessary suffering to the animal - in the dark.

Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons all sell meat from non-stunned animals produced by specialist halal suppliers, such as the London-based Haji Babab Halal Meats.

Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, leaving them in pain.

A spokesperson from Tesco said: 'We offer a range of products to meet the needs of customers from all communities.

'As part of our commitment to provide our customers with a choice, we sell a range of frozen, chilled halal meat and convenience products in areas where there is a demand for them.

'All halal products we sell are clearly marked as such, to enable customers to make informed decisions about their purchases.’

A spokesman from Morrisons said: 'All halal and kosher products are very clearly labelled so there can be no mistake'

Last week the Mail reported that all the major supermarkets are selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels.

Tesco says that by supplying halal products they are meeting the demands of their customers

Sainsbury's said: 'We do sell a selection of branded halal and kosher products in some stores, all of which is very clearly labelled'

'In New Zealand it is common for lamb to be blessed however we have never requested this and all of the meat we sell is from animals stunned prior to slaughter so it would be wrong to label our own-brand meat as halal,' a spokesman for Sainsbury's said.

'All of the own-brand meat we sell, 
including New Zealand lamb, is from animals stunned prior to slaughter. 
Under no circumstances would we ever sell own-brand meat from an animal 
that has not been stunned.

'We do sell a selection of branded halal and kosher products in some stores, all of which is very clearly labelled.'

A statement from the British Retail 
Consortium, which speaks on behalf of the industry, said: 'British 
retailers know that animal welfare standards are a key issue for their 
consumers.

'All own brand meat from major UK supermarkets comes from animals that have been stunned before they are killed and all our members have confirmed all their own brand fresh meat is from animals that have been pre-stunned before slaughter.

'However, we understand there are some customers who want meat from animals that have been slaughtered in accordance with strict religious protocols and in relevant stores meat produced by specialist producers is available with clear certification that is branded halal and kosher certified meat produced by specialist companies.'

Separately, many restaurants such as Pizza Express, and KFC are selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus.

The Conservative MP Philip Davies, who is leading calls for a new labelling law, said: ‘There is overwhelming public support for this change. People should be able to make an informed choice about what they are buying.’

Fast food giant Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 outlets, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers.

It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules.

The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with 'the views of religious communities'.
