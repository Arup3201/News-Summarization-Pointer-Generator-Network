She won hearts far and wide across Europe - and the world - when she won last week's Eurovision Song Contest, but Conchita Wurst truly is the queen in her home country.

Last Saturday night, Conchita’s Rise Like A Phoenix was awarded 290 points, ensuring that Eurovision 2015 will be held in the Austrian capital.

More than 10,000 people gathered in front of the federal chancellery in Vienna, to celebrate the return of Conchita to the stage.

Eventually, as more fake-bearded fans gathered in the square in front of Chancellor Werner Faymann's office, the space proved too small, forcing much of the crowd into a nearby park.

Wurst said her Song Contest victory is ‘not for me, but for people who believe in a future with progress.’

In a meeting with Wurst, Chancellor Faymann, head of the Austrian government, praised her as a symbol for ‘tolerance, love and joy of life.’

Wurst, the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, triumphed over the 25 contestants in this year’s contest, including British singer Molly Smitten-Downes, who came 17th with just 40 points.

As Conchita, she identifies as gender neutral but prefers to use female pronouns where this is needed.

Prior to Eurovision, Wurst had faced a barrage of homophobic and transphobic attacks from within her own country and from other countries including Russia, Armenia and Belarus, who branded the contest a 'hotbed of sodomy', the BBC reported.

'I can only say thank you for your attention. If this is only about me and my person, I can live with it', Wurst previously said about her critics in emails.

'You know, I have a very thick skin. It's just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement.'

This year's Song Contest was hosted by last year's winners, Denmark, with Eurovision 2015 to be held in Austria's capital Vienna.
