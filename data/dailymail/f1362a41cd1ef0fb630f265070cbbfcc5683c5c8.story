Gang members who paid impoverished Chinese villagers up to £2,500 to donate kidneys, which were smuggled around the country in boxes labelled as seafood have been jailed.

Qingshanhu District People's Court heard that the gang had originally started out illegally stealing organs from patients in Nanchang, the capital city of east China's Jiangxi Province.

Their organ trafficking programme proved so profitable that they moved from exclusively dealing with brain-dead patients to paying regular individuals to donate organs.

Their operation was so highly organised that they had even hired a ward at the Nanchang Huazhong Hospital, to carry out the operations.

The kidneys were then packaged in boxes and labelled as seafood before being sent on to the end destination where they were transferred into patients who paid tens of thousands for the illegal organ.

Mo Yongqing who was responsible for delivering the organs said that claiming they were frozen seafood worked even when suspicious security guards had checked the contents.

But the gang were caught by adverts that they were making online with increasing frequency for new people to donate organs.

The court jailed 12 members of the gang for sentences ranging from three years to 12 years for trafficking in human organs.

It heard that the gang had made £150,000 profit from selling the kidneys to the recipients for £12,000, having paid the original owner of the kidney just £2,500 for the donation.

One donor, a 21-year-old from Anhui Province, told the court that he had wanted to earn some money to show his father he could live on his own, and had been assured that he could live a perfectly normal life with one kidney.

Like the dozens of other donors he was recruited online and said that the gang had taken him to Nanchang in October 2011.

He added that prior to the transplant, he stayed in a motel under guard and was taken to two hospitals to see if he was a match with patients needing a transplant.

About three weeks later, he said he was blindfolded and taken to a hospital to have a kidney removed after which he was paid the promised £2,500.

Another man, a 27-year-old, said he sold a kidney to pay gambling debts and was taken from the city of Guangzhou to Nanchang in November 2011 to have it removed.

The gang paid the private Nanchang Huazhong Hospital £3,400 for the hire of a room for each operation.

Jiang Zhenglin, a doctor, earned around £1,000 for each operation and nurses 'borrowed' from other hospitals were paid up to £400.

Local media reported that many of the gang members had previously sold organs or had been transplant patients and took part because of the money to be made.

They were regarded as unlikely to betray the other members because of the fact that they either had illegal kidneys themselves, or had been paid to donate a kidney which is also illegal.
