England are building a ‘World Cup hub’ designed to digest data from all 64 games in Brazil and turn it into ammunition for Roy Hodgson and his team.

In what is shaping up to be a tournament with a heavy sports science influence, the Football Association will use an operational nerve centre at St George’s Park, the national football centre, to blend traditional scouting methods with the modern desire for video analysis.

England’s scouting team in Brazil will include Mike Rigg, the FA’s head of talent identification, Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development, Gareth Southgate, England’s Under-21 manager and scout John Marshall.

They will study England’s potential opponents and compile match reports in the normal manner, noting popular set-piece routines and the strengths and weaknesses of players, before liaising with those at St George’s Park.

The FA’s senior football analyst Steve O’Brien and his assistant Mike Baker will control the ‘World Cup hub’, where they will watch all 64 games played in Brazil and compile the facts and statistics.

They will study each game in the company of different football specialists and scouts employed by the FA and the coaches who are based at St George’s Park. This information will then be packaged and sent to Hodgson’s backroom team in Rio de Janeiro and used to enhance England’s tactics and strategy in Brazil.

There is friction developing inside football between the traditionalists, who value the eye and instinct of those steeped in football, and the technophiles who are embracing the masses of data and evidence now available.

This is the FA’s bid to carefully combine the two but it is fair to say no England football team will have embarked on a World Cup adventure armed with quite so much sports science expertise.

Hodgson, a traditionalist who is fairly open-minded about the advance of scientific data, will be able to use it to monitor the reaction of his players to the heat - they use heart-rate monitors and GPS tracking technology in training - and tactically within games if he wants.

Even after the tournament, the information gathered at the hub will be used to consider successful trends and strategies in international football, in the same way as a technical report.

Much of this comes into the realm of Dave Reddin, formerly Sir Clive Woodward’s right-hand man in England rugby union and consultant to the BOA, who is the FA’s new head of performance services and will be in Brazil. Reddin’s brief, according to the FA upon his appointment, was to ‘create new tournament strategies aimed at increasing success’.

Ashworth has described his role in the operation as ‘pivotal’. Woodward applauded the idea to employ Reddin when it was confirmed last year and said: ‘Dave is right up to date with everything going on in sport.’ 

There are two video analysis experts 
among the support staff for the World Cup: Andy Scoulding from Liverpool
 and Laurence Stewart from Hull City. Coach Gary Neville often spends 
the first half of England games in the stands studying the video 
technology and reporting back to Hodgson at half-time.

The Barclays Premier League stopped clubs installing TV monitors and laptops in the dug-outs, mainly to avoid pressure on officials after slow-motion replays and different camera angles highlifht poor decisions. But mobile phone technology is advancing at such a rate that video experts in the stands can quickly and easily send replay clips and statistical information to those sitting on the touchline. The trick is to identify the information which is both useful and easily digested.

England also have Liverpool’s sports scientist Barry Drust in Brazil and Arsenal’s nutritionist James Collins, who will have an important role because of the high temperatures.

Collins will be expected to keep the players’ bodies well hydrated and balanced with different minerals and electrolytes using energy bars, supplements, recovery drinks and post-match food.
