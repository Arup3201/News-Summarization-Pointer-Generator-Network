A respected California drama teacher stands to lose his job after appearing in a web series with some former students that showed him smoking marijuana.

Christian Kiley, a teacher at Etiwanada High School in Rancho Cucamonga since 2005, played a homeless man in a teaser for the upcoming amateur pilot, called Skidz, and was seen dragging for a marijuana joint.

After the trailer was posted to YouTube on August 20, the school started receiving complaints, and Kiley was placed on leave as the school district investigated the clip.

However Kiley said the show was fictitious, the cigarette he smoked was herbal, and sees no reason why he can't have his job back.

'It shouldn't be an issue': Etiwanda High School drama teacher Christian Kiley says his decision to act in an amateur web series with some former students should not cost him his job

'I'm mystified and perplexed by the way this has gone down,' Kiley told CBS Los Angeles.

'I think the example I'm trying to set for my students is to avoid artistic complacency and get out and do things.'

'I understand the need to have precautionary measures and the need to protect children but in this instance, and because it's former students and because it's within my right to freedom of artistic expression, I feel like it shouldn't be an issue.'

The trailer at the center of the problem has been removed from the internet.

According to The Daily Bulletin, it had been live on an age-protected YouTube channel for 15 hours and had been viewed 65 times before it was pulled down.

The creators of the 'comedic' series - who hope it will be picked up by a cable network - re-shot the scenes that featured Kiley with another actor.

Support: A Facebook page set up to help Kiley get his job back has been gathering supporters

Riley has been off work for five weeks.

The school district has not commented on the incident, which they say remains under investigation.

A Facebook page called Reinstate Christian Kiley at Etiwanda High School had 702 supporters as of Thursday.

Kiley's attorney, William Trejo, said it is an infringement of Kiley's free speech.

'If he had done the same thing in a popular TV series, like Breaking Bad, would they be attempting to terminate him as they are doing so today?' Trejo told CBS.

Skidz will be released on YouTube, without an appearance by Kiley, on October 2.
