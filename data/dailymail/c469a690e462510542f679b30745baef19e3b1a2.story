A mother is facing a £7,000 bill after her 12-year-old son ran up huge charges playing a popular online game on his phone.

Theresa Cox said she and her son James were not given any warning about costs of up to £240 a day on Clash of Clans.

T-Mobile said Supercell, the developer of the game, was responsible for setting the charges.

James Cox, 12, from Breaston, Derbyshire ran up the £7,000 phone bill while playing on his smartphone 

James was playing Clash of the Clans on his smartphone where he was paying £240-a-day for add ons

But Ms Cox, of Breaston, Derbyshire, said she might now have to sell her car to pay the debt.

She added: 'The only way I have financially of raising that money is selling my car and I need my car to get to work.

'I naively thought the industry was better regulated than this - that there were safeguards in place.

'Before you download the game it says there are in-app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it.

'Nobody at any point alerted me to the situation.'

Ms Cox's son inadvertently paid extra charges that are used to progress in the game. 

In similar games, players can pay for extra gaming credits - or add-ons - which would otherwise take a long time to build up or as a fast track to unlocking content in the game.

She told BBC Derbyshire: 'He bought two add-ons totalling £5.98 for the game Clash of Clans and the phone has kept buying (add-ons) at a rate of £240 per day.'

James said: 'I was confused to what had happened - I didn't have a clue.'

His mother said she did not blame her son, but added: 'He was slightly over-enthusiastic when playing on his phone.'

Alistair Charlton, a games expert with Mobile Choice website, said he had tried the game and that there were various password options for when transactions were necessary, including just once at the beginning, every 30 minutes or after each transaction.

Smartphones often operate on a system where applications themselves are free but various add-ons will then be offered to you in exchange for money.

This could take the form of in-game credits or 'currency' to help secure game upgrades or unlockable content or extra features with the application.

But there are options to turn off in-app purchases off on different systems.

On Apple's iOS the 'restrictions' menu it is possible to turn such purchases off altogether or set your own password.

Tap on 'Settings' then 'General' and 'Restrictions' then tap 'Enable Restrictions' and choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm.

At this point it's possible to set restrictions from a menu and in the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off'.

On Google Android open Google Play Store and cselect 'Menu' and then 'Settings' and under 'User Controls' there is an option to enter the PIN to confirm. At this point, tick the box to 'Use PIN for purchases' - anyone wanting to make a puchase in the app will have to know the PIN.

On Amazon Kindle Fire open the Amazon Appstore app and choose 'Menu' then 'Settings' and then select 'Parental Controls before tapping on 'Enable Parental Controls'. 

At this point you can enter your Amazon password or tick the 'Use PIN' box, if you prefer a PIN.

But he was unable to explain how £240 would have been charged every day. 

'For each payment made there would have been an email receipt sent to the person whose Google account is registered on the phone.

'Before you download the game it says there are in-app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it.'

Mrs Cox said: 'Mobile firms need to review procedures, and forget making a profit from vulnerable people.'

T-Mobile said it has placed Mrs Cox's bill on hold to allow to her resolve the issue with the game provider.

Supercell refused to comment on individual complaints, but advised users to read the parent's policy on the firm's website.
