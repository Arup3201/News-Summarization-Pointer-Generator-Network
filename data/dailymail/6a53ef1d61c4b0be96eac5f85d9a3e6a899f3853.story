Felipe Massa was at the centre of a rather embarrassing team orders row in Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix after he ignored a direct instruction from Williams to move over for team-mate Valtteri Bottas as the two diced for seventh place.

The message delivered from the Williams pit-wall was humiliating in its delivery, too – reminiscent of Ferrari infamously ordering Massa to allow Fernando Alonso to take the lead of the 2010 German Grand Prix – an instruction which ultimately lead to the end of the team order ruling.

'Felipe, Valtteri is faster than you. Do not hold him up,' was the instruction to Massa on Sunday – eerily similar to the 'Felipe, Fernando is faster than you' team directive from four years ago.

Massa subsequently defended his decision to ignore the order from the pit-wall, but Bottas argued he would have '100 per cent' caught Jenson Button who finished sixth.

Either way, an uncomfortable moment for Massa, who, after spending almost a decade of playing second fiddle to Michael Schumacher and then Alonso at Ferrari, would not have expected the same treatment at Williams - particularly to a team-mate only in his second full Formula One campaign.

Lewis Hamilton completed the perfect hat-trick of pole-position, race victory, and fastest lap for the first time since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.

Hamilton's 23rd career win also moved him to 11th on the all-time list alongside the Brazilian Nelson Piquet and one better than 1996 world champion Damon Hill.

Only Nigel Mansell (31), Sir Jackie Stewart (27) and Jim Clark (25) can claim to have won more races as a British driver.

It also marked the 100th points' finish of his career although Hamilton didn't wish to be reminded of that statistic afterwards.

'I don't want to hear that kind of stuff because it means I am getting old,' the 29-year-old quipped.

Daniel Ricciardo appears to have inherited the appalling bad luck which plagued the career of the man he replaced.  

After being thrown out of the results in Australia, Ricciardo, the replacement for Mark Webber at Red Bull, saw an almost certain fourth-placed finish snatched from his grasp after a bumbled pit-stop.

The botched job on the front-left tyre led to comical scenes in the pit-lane with his Red Bull crew then pushing the stricken Aussie back to the garage.

Ricciardo then suffered a failure with his front wing which led to a puncture before then having to serve a 10-second grid penalty for Red Bull's unsafe release. all in a matter of laps.

Red Bull's gaffe also means Ricciardo will serve a 10-place grid penalty at next week's Bahrain Grand Prix.  It never rains…

Mercedes made history on Sunday with their first 1-2 finish since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix.

The legendary Juan Manuel Fangio finished ahead of Piero Taruffi by just 0.7seconds at that race in Monza almost 60 years ago, but Hamilton's winning margin over Rosberg was rather more emphatic on Sunday.

Hamilton finished over 17 seconds ahead of his team-mate, going some way to disproving theories that the British racer might not have the tactical nous to cement a championship challenge this year.

'Why is Benedict Cumberbatch' was tending worldwide on Twitter after the British actor was the surprise choice to conduct the post-race podium interviews.

The job is one normally reserved for a Formula One legend, but Cumberbatch, known for his leading role in BBC drama Sherlock, turned in a credible performance.
