Christmas has never looked as cute as this one-foot-tall mini tree sprouting from a pothole in the snowy streets of London.

Other pictures compiled for a quirky book of mini-gardens planted in potholes across Britain's capital include a tiny Mini Cooper car in a royal garden with red-coated soldier, an iconic telephone box and the priceless reactions of real Londoners confronted with the strange scenes.

London pothole gardener Steve Wheen, 34, has created over 150 little gardens so far, the smallest being just one-inch-square.

'I really enjoy the reactions of people who come across my work,' said Steve.

'London can be so grey, especially at this time of year.

'When I was thinking about how to brighten up London, gardening came to mind.'

Steve has been pothole gardening for three-years, mainly around the streets of London.

His gardens are made with some compost and whichever flowers or he chooses to plant - usually costing between five and ten pounds each from his local garden centre.

While they are often temporary additions to the streets, Steve is sure that he makes a lasting impression on the people who are lucky enough to come across his work while they go about their daily lives.

Peaceful: Steve says his pothole gardens are partly a response to the lack of green space in London, but he mainly just wants people to enjoy an unexpected moment of pleasure

'I'm always surprised when I ask people what they think the message is behind my work,' he said.

'Often they think I'm protesting - I've even had one person suggest I was marking the places where people have died in car accidents.

'I think in a city like London, where it's easy to feel starved of green space, my message can be seen as a green one and that's fine with me.

'The environment is something we all need to be thinking about more and more.

'But most importantly, it's all about making people smile [and] giving them an unexpected moment of happiness.'

Steve's book, The Little Book of Little Gardens is available for £9.99 from www.thelittlebookoflittlegardens.com
