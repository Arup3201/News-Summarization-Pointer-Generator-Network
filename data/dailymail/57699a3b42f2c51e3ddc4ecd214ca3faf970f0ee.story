A couple who were tied to a large mortgage decided to downsize their home by creating their own tiny house on wheels costing just $33,000 (£19,600).

Andrew and Gabriella Morrison from Oregon were tired by the fact their lives revolved around monthly payments to the bank. So they decided to opt out of the rat race.

The pair both have backgrounds in construction and wanted a place that would feel like a real home, but more importantly be mortgage free.

And that's when they came up with the idea of hOMe, a tiny house on wheels, but which looks like a stylish abode both on the outside and in, and comes complete with high end appliances and furniture.

Mrs Morrison, 43, explained: 'It took us four months to build and cost $22,000 (£13,000), $33,000 (£19,600) if we include the high end appliances, cabinetry, furniture, and fixtures.

'We are now debt free, off grid, joyful, closer as a family, and enjoying living our lives full time in hOMe.'

Mrs Morrison adds that the house allows herself and husband Andrew, 41, to have a grown up living space, while daughter Terra, 14, has her own cabin nearby. The couple also have a 17-year-old son called Paiute who attends college.

As well as having no mortgage payments, their heating and cooling bills are significantly lower, due to the massive reduction in square footage to their home.

But because the home is built on a trailer, it is not recognised by building codes, meaning building permits are almost impossible to obtain.

The couple, pictured, wanted to downsize and created and designed the tiny house themselves, which ended up costing just $33,000

The entrance to the house, which even has a second storey; The interior cost the couple $11,000 to complete up to this standard

Not much to heat: Because their home is significantly smaller, the Morrisons' bills are much lower

The kitchen, complete with modern appliances and furniture, looks relatively spacious, but costs the couple a lot less to run

Despite being tiny, the home still has everything you would expect, including this comfortable bed (although the window is perhaps a bit small)

Mr Morrison relaxes with his guitar in his new lounge, which his wife says has brought them closer (literally) as a family

The home has been fitted out with all high end appliances, complete with space for storage of clothes and shoes and even has room for a fire

The house has regular facilities including a toilet and a shower so they never go wanting

The couple's daughter Terra, 14, has her own cabin nearby, but often goes to stay at her parents' house
