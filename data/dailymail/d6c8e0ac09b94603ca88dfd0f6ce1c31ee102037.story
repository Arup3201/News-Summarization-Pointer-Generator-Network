'Bailout': The nephew of JFK, Robert Kennedy Jr., received $1.4bn of taxpayers' cash for his company, it is claimed

The nephew of former president John F. Kennedy has been given a secret £1.4bn bailout for his company thanks to his White House connections, a new book has claimed.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr is said to have received the vast sum of tax-payers' cash for his 'green energy' firm BrightSource while it was $1.8bn in debt in 2010.

The payment was made by Sanjay Wagle, a former BrightSource  employee who after raising money for Barack Obama was rewarded with a job in the U.S. Department of Energy, it is claimed.

The revelation was made in an explosive new book, Throw The All Out, which exposes the secret financial deals of an inner circle of businessmen and politicians in the White House.

The author Peter Schweizer says that the payment was made to Kennedy Jr. thanks to connections in Washington.

Kennedy Jr. is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Robert 'Bobby' Kennedy is the brother of the former president JFK, who was assassinated in 1963.

Following JFK's assasiantion in November 1963, Robert 'Bobby' Kennedy continued to serve as Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson for nine months.

However, he later split after disagreements over the Vietnam War and by 1968 was a favourite for the Democratic Party leadership.

Tragically, just hours after winning the California presidential Bobby Kennedy was shot three times by Sirhan Sirhan by Arab gunman Sirhan Sirhan while addressing a packed hotel in L.A. He died 26 hours later on June 26. 

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has forged a successful career as an attorney specialising in environmental law and more recently and as a radio host,

Wagle was one of the principals in Kennedy’s firm who raised money for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.

When Obama was elected to the White House in 2008, Wagle was installed at the Department of Energy (DOE), advising on energy grants.

BrightSource, whose largest 
shareholder is Kennedy’s VantagePoint Partners, is said to have faced 
financial difficulties before the bailout.

The company needed a massive government contract for a solar-panel plant on federal lands on California if it was to survive.

A
 company statement from the time said: 'Our future success depends on 
our ability to construct Ivanpah, our first utility-scale solar thermal 
power project, in a cost-effective and timely manner.

'Our ability to complete Ivanpah and the planning, development and construction of all three phases are subject to significant risk and uncertainty.'

The company was able to continue with the project after the bailout, it is alleged.

Just two years previously, Kenndery Jr. had said publicly that Obama's energy plans would create 'a gold rush'.

Claims: Throw Them All Out by investigative journalist Peter Schweizer

Schweizer writes in Throw Them All Out: 'A billion dollars in taxpayer money being sent to wealthy investors to bail them out of risky investments—does this sound familiar to anyone?'

It is also claimed in the book that billionaire investor Warren Buffet profited with millions from the government bailout programs he helped design.

However, all of transactions are legal in the U.S. The book merely highlights how 'insiders' can profit from the system.

Schweizer also claims that Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, bought VISA shares while she was overseeing legislation that would directly impact the stock’s value.

Schweizer writes in the book: 'Politicians have made politics a business. They are increasingly entrepreneurs who use their power, access, and privileged information to generate wealth.

'And at the same time well-connected financiers and corporate leaders have made a business of politics. They meet together in the nation’s capital to form a political caste.

'In short, the Permanent Political Class has clearly figured out how to extract wealth from the rest of us based solely on their position and proximity to power. If you have a seat at the table, you are in for a feast.

'If you don’t have a seat at the table, you are probably on the menu. Exactly how crony capitalists are consuming public wealth and fattening themselves is the subject of this book.'

He said that Palosi had profited from a street lighting project which she was in charge of.

He added: 'For years, Nancy Pelosi has pushed for earmarks to construct and ultimately extend San Francisco’s so-called Third Street Light Rail Project.

'In 2004, she boasted to her constituents that she had secured more than $120 million in federal money for the project. Third Street is one of the most expensive light rail projects ever, costing $660 million for just a six-mile route. '
