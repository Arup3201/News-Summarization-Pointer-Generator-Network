Mollie King has fast become a front row regular and attendee at some of fashion's hottest parties - she was even unveiled as the first ever ambassador for Oasis this week.

And it seems that her foray into fashion hasn't gone unnoticed because the star has landed herself a modelling contract too.

The Saturdays singer, 26, has been signed by Next Models where she will join a roster of talent including Alexa 
Chung, Rita Ora, Lana Del Rey and Suki 
Waterhouse.

First look: Mollie King has landed herself a modelling contract with Next Model Management and says she couldn't be more excited about her exciting new venture

Speaking about the new signing, Sarah Leon, head of talent at Next, told MailOnline: 'Mollie has a really great style identity and we started to notice her fashion potential. 

'We are really excited to continue working with Mollie, she has great things ahead.'

Front row regular Mollie, who has been quietly creating a new grown-up style for herself and  taking her success up a notch by carving out a career in fashion, couldn't be more excited about the new partnership.

She told us: 'I am so thrilled about signing with Next, I couldn't believe it when they approached me about it.

'I am joining the likes of Alexa Chung, who I just love, so I am seriously flattered.' 

Mollie's first shoot with Next, which we can exclusively reveal, shows the 5ft 4in singer looking fresh-faced and natural.

A
 far cry from her usual preppy look, Mollie sports a messy bun, super 
short black dress and grungy black platform shoes - but pulls off the 
look with aplomb.

Mollie's new venture was announced at an intimate press dinner this week, which also saw her unveil her 'Loved By Mollie' a/w13 collection for Oasis - a 45-piece capsule range from the brand's new season styles that has been handpicked by the well-dressed singer.

The clothing line features the 
26-year-old’s personal fashion favourites and includes oversized coats, 
fitted leather skirts, pretty pastels, and floral prints.

A
 spokesperson for Oasis told MailOnline that the collaboration was a 
‘natural progression’ for the singer, who has championed the High Street
 label for years.

Hell for leather: Mollie has chosen a fashion forward edit, Loved By Mollie Chosen - a 45-piece collection which highlights her favourite key pieces for the season

Mollie also serves as an ambassadress for luxury handbag label, Aspinal of London, who even named a handbag after her.

The £450 satchel, which the singer often carries, is described on the Aspinal of London
 website as 'a must-have investment piece for the modern girl on the 
go' and is available in tan, beige and black.

If Mollie's new fashion ventures are anything to go by, it seems that Alexa Chung better watch her back.
