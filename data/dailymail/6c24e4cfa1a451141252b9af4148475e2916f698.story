Protest of innocence: Bill Boal, pictured here arriving for trial in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was accused of taking part in the Great Train Robbery

The family of a man convicted over the Great Train Robbery have launched a fresh appeal nearly 50 years on to clear his name, with one gang member declaring 'he had absolutely nothing to do with it'.

Bill Boal was one of 12 men jailed for the audacious crime in August 1963, which resulted in the gang taking £2.5 million from the Glasgow-to-London Night Mail train.

Boal, who was sentenced to 24 years - later reduced to 14 on appeal - died in 1970 from cancer while still in prison. He always protested his innocence.

Now robber Roger Cordrey's son Tony has spoken out by stating what Boal's family always believed - that the engineer from Fulham, west London was not involved in the robbery.

Speaking to the Sunday People, he said: 'Bill was totally innocent. Dad said many, many times Bill had absolutely nothing to do with the robbery.'

His statement comes as Boal's family revealed they are preparing a file asking the Criminal Case Review Commission to look again at their father’s case.

If successful, they hope to convince the Appeal Court to reverse his conviction and clear his name.

It will include testimony from gang members and include evidence ruled out of the original trial.

Boal was convicted after the police 
found him with Cordery's car, which contained £141,000 - his friend's share of the massive haul.

He always maintained that he was unaware of the stolen money - and other gang members have supported this.

Nick Reynolds, the son of convicted robber Bruce Reynolds, told the Sunday People: 'Bill never played any part in it and the rest of the guys were completely stunned when he was convicted.'

Reynolds, who died earlier this year aged 81, also left a hand-written statement confirming Boal was never involved.

Boal's family hope the relatives of other gang members will now come forward to help their fight for justice.

His son David, 62, said Boal's conviction 'virtually destroyed' his life and those of his mother Renee, his brother Anthony and sister, Debbie.

'We carry the scars – some of them very open and very real – to this day.'

Boal met Cordrey after lodging with his family in Hampton, west London.

The two became friends and shared a love of racing, snooker and gambling.

Both their worlds were shattered following the events of August 8, 1963, dubbed by police as 'the crime of the century'.

Hideout: Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire was used by the gang in the days following the robbery

The gang laid low for five days at Leatherslade Farm – 17 miles from the ambush site near Ledburn, Beds – before splitting the money and dispersing.

Soon afterwards, Cordrey rang Boal to tell him he could repay a debt that he owed his friend.

He invited Boal to join him in a 'project' in Bournemouth – and Bill decided to combine it with a family trip to the seaside.

They travelled by train to Oxford, where Cordrey met them in his new Rover.

Boal's son Anthony noticed bags and cases, which he thought were filled with fishing tackle for their trip.

There were so many that the children had to sit on them during the trip to Dorset.

In fact the bags contained the stolen money, which would be worth £2.6million today.

Once they arrived in Bournemouth, Boal sent his wife and children to the beach while Cordrey asked him to help him find a garage and flat to rent and to buy another car.

Boal's sons believe Cordrey also gave their father £220, with a promise of giving him another £430 in another couple of days, to repay the entire debt.

But within a week of the robbery, both were arrested after offering to pay cash for three months’ rent on a lock-up garage.

The owner was a policeman’s widow, who became suspicious of the amount of money owned by the pair.Two years later, Boal told a lawyer that he had only stayed with Cordrey because he believed his debt would eventually be settled.

Boal died in June 1970, four months after Jack Mills, the train driver who violently coshed in the robbery.

Victim: Bruce Reynolds, pictured with his wife Angela prior to his death earlier this year, maintained that Boal was innocent in his autobiography

He protested his innocence until the end and had written letters addressed to the European Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the Official Solicitor.

Gang member Bruce Reynolds also spoke of Boal as a 'victim' in his autobiography: 'Bill Boal was a victim of the judicial process.

'And while we, the Great Train Robbers, accept responsibility for injuring Jack Mills, I’ve yet to hear of anyone ­accepting responsibility for what was done to Bill Boal.'
