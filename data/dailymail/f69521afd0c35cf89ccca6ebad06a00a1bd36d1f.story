A U.S. military helicopter with four crew onboard has crashed at an American airbase in Japan, it was confirmed today.

The HH-60 rescue helicopter crashed in a training area at Camp Hansen on the southern island of Okinawa.

The U.S. Air Force said all four crew members are believed to have survived.

Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters that three crew members ejected from the helicopter and the fourth was apparently injured and taken to hospital.

Onodera said the accident was 'regrettable' and that he was asking the U.S. to provide information promptly, conduct a thorough investigation and take preventive measures.

The helicopter, which belongs to Okinawa's Kadena Air Base, was on an unspecified training mission, the Air Force said in a statement.

Officials said the cause of the crash is not yet known.

Television footage showed smoke rising a remote mountainside forest and officials said firefighters had been dispatched to the area.

Okinawa prefectural police said there were no reports of injuries among local residents.

However, the crash could add to anger over the concentration of U.S. military bases on the island.

About half of the 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan are based on Okinawa under a Japan-U.S. security pact.

Kadena Mayor Hiroshi Toyama said: 'We knew it was going to happen sooner or later.'

Local media said the crash revived memories of an accident in 2004, when a CH-53 helicopter from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma crashed into a nearby university building, triggering a huge anti-base uproar although there were no civilian injuries and the crew survived.

Many residents associate the U.S. bases with accidents, crime and pollution.
