Black British actors are being forced to move to America because they are not given a chance in the UK, stand up comic Lenny Henry told MPs today.

The Comic Relief founder said Hollywood stars like Idris Elba, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Marianne Jean-Baptiste were being overlooked by the BBC and other TV bosses.

He pointed to the lack of ethnic minorities on TV - but praised EastEnders as the top show for showing black and Asian families.

Lenny Henry today called on MPs to guarantee more jobs for black and ethnic minority actors on TV. He said stars like Idris Elba did not need extra training - they just needed a break

The actor - joined by former BBC chief Patrick Younge and the corporations's current Scottish news boss Marcus Ryder - unveiled a 'Henry' plan to get more black and ethnic minorities into the TV industry.

Under Mr Henry's proposals, the BBC will have to hit targets for hiring top black and ethnic minority actors and producers.

The comedian told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that black actors like Idris Elba did not need greater training or other gimmicks - they 'just need a break'. He added: 'Initiatives don't work, jobs do.'

He said: 'We are haemorrhaging talent in this country. Not just BME (black and minority ethnic) people like Idris Elba and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. They could be working here benefiting us.'

Mr Henry shot to fame when he won the talent show New Faces in 1975. 

He has criticised the TV and film industry for not providing a 'fair and honest reflection of our society' and recently signed up to a committee advising the corporation on its representation of ethnic minorities. 

The session comes the day after the acting chairman of the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - said it should do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain

Diane Coyle, who is in the running to replace Lord Patten as head of the trust, admitted its flagship soap EastEnders is 'almost twice' as white as the real East London.

In a speech at the London School of Economics, Ms Coyle, said the BBC's Audience Council for England 'compared the population of Walthamstow in East London with Walford - the fictional home of EastEnders'.

She said: 'The Audience Council figures suggested that there are almost twice as many white people living in fictional E20 as in real life E17, while the population of EastEnders tends to be younger than their real life counterparts and more likely to have been born in the UK.'

Former Chief Creative Officer of BBC Television Production Patrick Younge joined Lenny Henry at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee today

She said it would be 'daft' for the show to be a 'perfect replica' of the real world, but said it was 'important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain'.

Director-General Tony Hall announced last week that the BBC would set up a new £2.1 million 'diversity creative talent fund' to help 'fast-track' shows by ethnic minority talent onto the screen and create a series of development programmes aimed at encouraging future commissioners and executives from ethnic minority backgrounds.

He also said he wanted to see ethnic minorities account for 15 per cent of on-air talent in the next three years.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Last week we set out far reaching plans that we believe will make a tangible difference - we will work hard to deliver them and of course reserve the option of going further if we fall short, but people should judge us on progress over the coming months and years before concluding the need for even more measures.'
