Francis Coquelin was left nursing a bloody nose for a second time this month after a collision with Marouane Fellaini just five minutes into Arsenal's FA Cup quarter final victory at Old Trafford.

The Frenchman was seen to by the Arsenal medical staff, and was given the all clear before returning to give a Man-of-the-Match performance.

The Arsenal midfielder suffered a broken nose at the beginning of the month following a bruising bump with team-mate Olivier Giroud during the Gunners 2-0 Barclays Premier League win over Everton.

He was forced to wear a protective mask during Arsenal's victory at QPR last week and trained with it too.

And he could have done with it in Manchester after requiring the club's doctors to rush on the pitch to clean him up.

Not wearing his mask, the young Frenchman was left bloodied after an early blow from United midfielder Fellaini.

The 23-year-old was swiftly back on his feet, however, and was cleared to continue.
