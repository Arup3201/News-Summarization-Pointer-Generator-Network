Scandal: MP Sir Cyril Smith, who died in 2010, tried to interfere with an investigation into his child abuse in 1970, new documents revealed today

Sir Cyril Smith tried to bully police after they launched an investigation into claims he molested young boys, according to files.

The late politician went to a police station in 1970 and demanded to know why  detectives were investigating the claims.

Officers later submitted a file to prosecutors with a covering letter that said: ‘He appears guilty of indecent assault.’

During their meeting Smith tried to find out from officers who his accusers were and admitted approaching two of the teenagers.

An officer then warned him about interfering with witnesses and accused the politician of ‘fishing’ for information, according to the records.

Last night an MP claimed the documents – released in a Freedom of Information request this week – prove that 30st Smith was trying to meddle with the police investigation.

Six weeks after his visit to Rochdale police station detectives passed the file to prosecutors, describing his conduct as ‘inexcusable’.

Their covering note added: ‘He has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys to whom he had a special responsibility. He appears guilty of numerous offences of indecent assault.’

Attempt: Smith was trying to find out the names of his accusers as he said it would impact on his electioneering in Rochdale

The file, submitted by Lancashire Constabulary, was examined by prosecutors who decided to take no further action against him.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) 
has now admitted it should have prosecuted the politician after 
allegations of abuse in the 1960s.

The decision not to prosecute left Smith free to prey on other vulnerable young children, it later emerged.

Meddling: ' The former Liberal MP for Rochdale has been accused by the current one Simon Danczuk, who says it shows how hard Smith tried to influence the police

In 1972 – two years after the case 
was dropped – he won the Rochdale by-election for the Liberals and 
served as MP until 1992. He died aged 82 in 2010.

This week it emerged that Jimmy 
Savile could also have been stopped from abusing children up to 50 years
ago, but police failed to act on allegations.

Documents show that in January 1970 
Smith, then a prominent Liberal councillor, asked to meet detectives at 
Rochdale police station to find out the names of his accusers.

A transcript of the conversation 
between Smith and detectives shows he was determined to challenge the 
police for launching an investigation.

Smith began the meeting by asking 
bluntly: ‘Why are the inquiries going on?’ and ‘Whom did you approach 
for statements?’ He also asked what stage the police had reached in 
their inquiry and when he would know if he was to be charged.

Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for 
Rochdale, said the documents prove Smith tried to bring pressure to bear
on the police to drop charges.

Smith was accused of inflicting 
humiliating punishments on teenage boys in the 1960s and 70s at a hostel
he had helped to set up. His victims say he would spank their naked 
bottoms and order them to strip for ‘degrading’ medicals despite a 
doctor not being present.

It emerged that between 1970 and 1998
police tried to have him charged three times but when his 80-page file 
was first passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions it was marked 
‘no further action’.

Last year the CPS admitted Smith avoided prosecution only because sex abuse cases were dealt with differently 40 years ago.

For decades, damaging rumours swirled around Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith - a political legend locally and nationally.

But
despite police 40 years ago being convinced he had indecently assaulted
young boys, the 30-stone Liberal never faced justice.

Today a transcript of a conversation her had with police shows how he tried to 'interfere' with their investigation.

Saturday January 24, 1970 - 11.20am, Rochdale police station

OFFICER:
Well, very briefly the allegations concerning that, are that you went 
along there and examined these boys by taking their pants down. Whether 
that's right or not, I don't know.

CYRIL: I understand that that's the subject of the investigation.

OFFICER: Which, pending on what explanation you put forward, would seem improper.

OFFICER: If my information is right, you spoke to one of the boys, who has been interviewed.

CYRIL: Yes.

OFFICER: What was that about?

CYRIL:
He told me what you had been asking him. He told me he had made a 
statement to you. I've seen two of them and the third came to see me. 
I've asked them if they have made statements.

OFFICER: I must 
warn you about interfering with witnesses. The only reason I am here 
this morning is because you wanted to see me. I did not want to see you.
You must have some suspicion about you and them, about what's in the 
statements or you would not be here, would you?

CYRIL: Well - 
er - I'm hesitating, not because I'm frightened, but I've seen a 
solicitor obviously, and he says I must make no statement or answer no 
questions. If they want to question you on those lines, tell them that 
you have appointed a solicitor. It's not that I'm afraid to answer the 
questions, it's purely because I'm advised not to do.

OFFICER: What you have come on this morning is just a fishing expedition. You want to see what we know.

CYRIL:
Well, yes, fishing - I think that is fair comment. But one of my 
problems is - I don't know if you know about local affairs.

OFFICER: No, I have no connection locally.

CYRIL:
Well the situation is this. In three weeks time, I've got to give a 
decision, one way or another, whether I'm going to fight the next 
Parliamentary Election as a Liberal in Rochdale, and if I'm going to be 
charged, I'm not going to accept. Guilty or not guilty, it would be 
unfair to the party. On the other hand, if I am not going to be charged I
would like to have a do, and I have got to make my mind up in the next 
three weeks.
