Maria Sharapova beat Shaui Peng in straight sets on Sunday to set up a mouthwatering Australian Open quarter-final clash with Eugenie Bouchard.

World No 2 Sharapova needed just one hour and 15 minutes to see off No 21 seed Peng 6-3, 6-0 on Rod Laver Arena.

It guarantees a last-eight meeting with Bouchard, who earlier survived a second-set collapse to beat Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1, 5-7, 6-2.

Tuesday's match will be their first meeting since Roland Garros last year, when Sharapova fought back in three sets before going on to claim the title.

Sharapova said: 'Last year I think she had the most consistency in all the Grand Slams. Our last match was at the French Open and it was a really tough three-setter.

'She has been playing incredibly well and confident tennis. I have a tough match but I always look forward to these matches'

The first set proved tight in the early stages with breaks exchanged before Sharapova edged ahead again for 5-3 and the Russian made no mistake in serving it out.

Sharapova, a former Melbourne champion in 2008, then took charge as she hit 14 winners and made just 5 unforced errors in a flawless second set.

She said: 'I'm so happy. Last year I lost in the fourth round so getting to the quarters here is really special.'
