Louis van Gaal will continue with his big-spending 'Galacticos' transfer policy this summer as Manchester United prepare to go big in their search of title glory.

And the Dutchman will focus his attentions on landing proven international talent, rather than high-risk, big-money youngsters, that have become a feature of the club's transfer policy in recent seasons.

United spent close to £150million on the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria last summer - deals that have not gone as well as expected.

Nevertheless, as long as United qualify for next season's Champions League, the Old Trafford money-men will sanction another £100m-plus transfer splurge to help turn the club into realistic title contenders again.

And Van Gaal will continue to focus his attentions on high-profile deals, rather than unproven potential, despite having his fingers burned by Falcao and Di Maria.

United signed a clutch of young talent in recent seasons as the club look to build for the future.

But the strategy has not proved as fruitful as they'd hoped.

And Van Gaal will target players he feels are in their prime and can hit the ground running.

Borussia Dortmund defender and World Cup winner Mats Hummels, 26, is a prime target, as is Holland international Memphis Depay.

Juventus star Paul Pogba, widely regarded as one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the world, is also on United's radar.

United have a long-standing interest in Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, 25, but a serious knee injury has thrown a potential move to Old Trafford into doubt.

Van Gaal has a major interest in Gareth Bale but the Wales international wants to stay at Real Madrid, as Sportsmail revealed this morning.

Porto's Danilo, who is valued at £30m, is a target as Van Gaal looks for a new right back.

But the Brazil international is set for a move to Real Madrid, meaning United have turned their attentions to England's first choice right-back Nathaniel Clyne or Barcelona star Dani Alves.

The illustrious list indicates the calibre of player United are intent on signing this summer as they look to re-establish themselves among Europe's elite.

A string of expensive young signings have not progressed as expected in recent seasons, a failure that has not gone unnoticed by Van Gaal.

And the Dutchman wants to avoid similar mistakes this summer.

The £15m capture of Wilfried Zaha in January 2013 has turned out to be a disaster, likewise the signing of Alex Buttner in the summer of 2012 was one to forget.

The jury is still out on the £31.5m signing of Luke Shaw last summer, while the captures of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling - who cost a combined total of £26m - have also been questioned.
