Thousands of Norwegians took to the streets today to sing a children's song that deluded mass killer Anders Behring Breivik claimed was being used to brainwash youngsters.

Some 40,000 converged on Oslo's central square to 'face terror with music' and sing the 1970s song Children of the Rainbow.

Just a few hundred metres away, Breivik continued to stand trial in the city's courthouse for his July 22 bombing-and-shooting rampage that killed 77 people.

Last week he said the song, a Norwegian version of American folk singer Pete Seeger's Rainbow Race, was an example of how 'cultural Marxists' are infiltrating schools.

Later the protesters, who came together through Facebook, laid roses on the steps of the courthouse in memory of those killed in the massacre.

Shocked by his lack of remorse for the slaughter, Norwegians have decided the best way to confront him is by demonstrating their commitment to everything he loathes.

In court, people who survived Breivik's car bomb in Olso's government district gave emotional testimony as he listened expressionless.

Anne Helene Lund, 24, was just 23ft from the explosion. She was in a coma for a month, and when she woke up she had lost her memory, unable to remember even her parents names.

Her father, Jan Erik Lund, also took to the stand. Fighting tears, he described his mixed emotions at seeing his daughter with severe life-threatening brain injuries in the hospital.

He said: 'It was like experiencing the worst and the best in the same moment. It was fantastic that she was alive, horrible that she was as injured as she was.'

Breivik says he was targeting the governing Labour Party, which he claims has betrayed the country by opening its borders to Muslim immigrants.

He has shown no remorse for the attacks, which he coldly described last week in gruesome detail. Since he has admitted to the attacks, Breivik's mental state is the key issue for the trial to resolved.

If found guilty and sane, Breivik would face 21 years in prison, though he can be held longer if deemed a danger to society.

If declared insane, he would be committed to compulsory psychiatric care.

Yesterday a man injured in the devastating Oslo bomb blast described the terrifying aftermath as blood pumped out of his arm and panic started to set in.

Eivind Dahl Thoresen, 26, was hit by falling debris on the street outside the Norwegian government building in the July 22 explosion that killed eight.

Face to face with Breivik at the latter's trial he said he only realised he was in trouble when, rushing to help another victim, he was told: 'Are you going to help me? Look at yourself.'

With blood soaking through his jeans and T-shirt, he cried for help until two people arrived to bandage his wounds with clothes he was carrying in a bag.

He said: 'I felt alternately cold and warm. At that point I was sure I would die.'

Thoresen, who was hospitalised for three weeks after the blast so doctors could surgically remove shards from his arms and legs, still needs crutches to walk.

His lawyer showed the court pictures of the grim scene.
