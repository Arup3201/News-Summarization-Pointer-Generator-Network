Startling hidden camera footage shows migrants crossing illegally into the U.S. from Mexico, via a couple's private property.

Jim and Sue Chilton run a 50,000-acre cattle ranch southwest of Tucson, Arizona and for years they've complained about illegal immigrants - and suspected drug cartel members - jumping the four-strand wire fence that marks their 5 1/2-mile border with Mexico.

The couple even testified before Congress about the issue plaguing other Americans like them, who are abandoned by border patrol officers who maintain only a limited presence on rugged areas of the border.

Sneaking across: Hidden camera footage shows illegal immigrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico on an American couple's 50,000-acre ranch in southern Arizona

Delivery men: Jim and Sue Chilton run a cattle ranch that spans 5 1/2 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. Above, more migrants walking on their property with large packs usually used to transport drugs

To prove just how at risk they are, the couple enlisted the help of border-security advocacy group SecureBorderIntel.org to set up several hidden cameras on their property.

The group installed the cameras in well traveled paths about 10-15 miles north of the international border in March and April.

In June, they came back to the property and the Chilton's worst nightmares were confirmed: migrants, many carrying large packs used for drug smuggling, hiking over their ranch.

'It just confirmed what we already knew,' Jim Chilton told NBC News. 'We have ceded to the cartels 20 miles, 30 miles inside the United States.'   

On their own: Some American land-owners like the Chiltons are left defenseless on the border, since the land it too rugged to patrol

Ranchers like the Chiltons are particularly at risk because they live in a no-man's land along the border.

While U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has more officers than ever maintaining the border, they leave rugged areas of land like the Chilton's Ranch relatively unchecked and instead patrol further north where it's easier to catch illegal immigrants.

Sue Chilton says she used to roam about her ranch freely, but now never goes without an escort for fear of becoming another victim of the aggressive cartels.

Another group caught on the hidden cameras is dressed in all camouflage while carrying much lighter packs

Without a trace: One in the group stays behind to sweep up their tracks

The 2010 unsolved murder of Arizona rancher Rob Krentz is believed to have been carried out by a smuggler who shot the man to death on his own land.

'The fear we have is running across a group coming across with an AK-47 dressed in camouflage garb and carpet shows and small backpacks on their backs carrying meth, crack or heroin,' her husband Jim said.

Many smugglers wear carpet shoes while crossing the borders to cover up their tracks. In one of the hidden camera videos, a group is seen in all camo walking on the ranch while a man in the back sweeps up their steps. 

The Chiltons say they find evidence of illigal immigrants on their land all the time, such as break-ins at their home and trash and clothing left behind.
