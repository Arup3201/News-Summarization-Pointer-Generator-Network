Time-poor golfers who struggle to fit a round into their busy lives have come up with a novel way of working on their swings - playing with fluorescent balls under spotlights in the middle of the night.

The specialised LED golf balls are used by Sydney-based company Light It Up Golf which regularly hosts after-dark events across the country in a bid to make the sport more accessible to generations that are otherwise too busy.

Light It Up Golf owners, Brad and Joel McIntosh, set up thousands of custom lights around nine hole golf courses and light up pins and holes to help golfers navigate their way in the dark.

'We basically make the golf course come alive at night,' Brad McIntosh told Daily Mail Australia.

'The night golf concept brings a lot more fun to the sport. It's that wow factor.'

Mr McIntosh said they created the company a year ago after seeing a massive decline in golf membership across Australia over several years.

'A lot of people had gone away from golf because of work or family and people don't tend to come back to golf until their 50s,' he said.

'That's the main issue we saw... time-poor people,' he said.

'Younger people donâ€™t even have time to play. At least with (Light It Up Golf) it's after work and they can play once a week if they like.'

The team spent two years developing the concept, which involved creating an LED-based golf ball that lights up for 11 minutes when it hits a club or the ground.

'In 12 months we've run over 50 events across Australia and the feedback has been more than what we expected,' Mr McIntosh said.

'Clubs are getting 30 to 40 new members at the golf clubs from our events.

'At one event, we had four people come from 300km away just to play. People are lining up to play.'

The latest event was held at Castle Hill Country Club in Sydney on Friday.
