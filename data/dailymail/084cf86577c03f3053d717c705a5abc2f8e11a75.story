If you can hardly bear the thought of your mother-in-law coming over for lunch, look away now. 

Britain's biggest family gathering was held in Buckland Brewer in Devon as 130 people celebrated their gene pool and enjoyed a bit of a catch-up.

Four generations of the Heal family travelled from far and wide to be there with some flying in from New Zealand.

We are family: 130 of John Heal and Mary-Anne Fry's descendants met in Devon to celebrate

Most of the clan live in Devon and Cornwall but some family emigrated to Australia and New Zealand in the 1800s sparking a geographical split from the herd. 

With far too many  to fit inside a house, pub or any other local venue, organisers borrowed a giant marquee to house the monster celebration. 

One for the album: Guests wore name stickers to identify themselves

All present were descendants of John Heal and Mary-Anne Fry, who were stalwarts of the rural farming community in the 19th century and are buried in the local cemetery. 

The last family gathering of the Heal brood took place in 1987 but only attracted 30 to 40 people.

Originals John and Mary had nine children, who had dozens more between them, and their children went on to have scores more themselves. 

Their great granddaughter Emily Heal, 89, was the oldest relative in attendance and the youngest, was six week old Edith Beer - John and Mary's great, great, great granddaughter.

Family matters: Luckily, the sun shone during the gathering in the village of Buckland Brewer

The jolly affair was organised by Lorna Hicks, 65, and her cousins who used genealogy records to build a family tree  before sending out invites.

She said: 'We always knew we had family overseas, it was quite common for people to emigrate from here back then.

Four generations of the Heal clan met in a wedding marquee because they could not fit inside a house or pub

'In my grandfather's generation, three of five boys emigrated. Only one of the boys lived at home the whole time.

'Some of my cousins had been meaning to have this event for a long time, and it finally seemed like the right time to do it.'

Despite the success of this meeting, they aren't planning another reunion any time soon. 

Some relatives travelled from New Zealand to ensure they were there for the big day

Lorna added: 'We had a marquee from a wedding and we did a "bring and share".

'It was a great fun day, lots of sitting around and chatting. Living so far apart we had lots to catch up on.

'It's not the sort of thing you want to do too often though - the logistics are a little daunting and the novelty would soon wear off.

'We might do one in another 10 years or so.'
