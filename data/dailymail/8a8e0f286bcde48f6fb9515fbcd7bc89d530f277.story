Three Delaware teenagers involved in videotaped assaults of a mentally disabled man have been sentenced to probation and house arrest, followed by placement in a secure juvenile facility.

The teens were sentenced Monday after each pleaded guilty to a single felony count of crime against a vulnerable adult.

The boys, two 15-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were sentenced to probation and house arrest for the rest of the school year, followed by summer placement at a juvenile facility.

Videos posted online showed the 27-year-old victim being body-slammed to the ground, stomped on and kicked, and repeatedly punched in the head.

Attack: The victim (in gray) can be seen trying to stop the youths from attacking him

Violent: One of the boys picks the man up before throwing him to the ground. Others can be heard laughing

Hurt: The man, who can be heard groaning, was reportedly treated at the hospital afterwards for injuries

The defendants were charged with offensive touching, assault of a vulnerable adult, and conspiracy. Prosecutors later added hate-crime charges, which were dropped along with other charges following the guilty pleas.

A video that was posted to YouTube shows a group of teenagers pursuing the victim as he shouts: 'Leave me alone!'

One boy swings at the man, repeatedly punching him, before picking him up and throwing him to the ground on at least two occasions.

The boys then crowd around the man - while one teenager who is filming the attack on his cellphone nears the man to get a closer shot as he writhes on the floor.

A separate video reveals them attacking the man in a wooded area, Fox29 reported.

In that attack, the victim can be heard crying, while a female voice says: 'You guys are so mean to him.' 

In September, the victim's mother Yana told WPVI that while initially seeing the video she felt 'Rage, anger - because of the situation, with him being mentally disabled, he doesn't do anything to anyone but be kind.'

Yana told the television station her son Karon has Williams Syndrome.

Those with Williams Syndrome often have an intellectual disability, heart defects, a slight stature and distinctive facial features, including a flat nasal bridge. Sufferers are often extremely friendly.

'He's not doing too good,' his godmother Debra Jackson told CBS3 in September. 'One, he's ashamed about it happening, he’s embarrassed.'

She added that her godson thought the teenagers were his friends. 

That same month, one teenager who appeared in footage told CBS 3 that he assisted in reporting what happened. He said the assaults were filmed in Newark.

He told the television station at the time 'The right thing to do was call the cops. If you beat up a mentally disabled person, you should be locked away for good.'

Cruel: As the group surround him, one of the teenagers (with the backpack) is more concerned about getting a close-up snap of the victim than helping him

Concern: The victim's godmother and sister (seen in September) said that he is ashamed and thought the teens were his friends
