An Iraq War veteran who was one of the first to critique the conflict has died some 10 years after he was left paralyzed from the neck down while serving in the Army.

Tomas Young, 34, of Seattle, Washington died Monday, the day before Veteran's Day, and the cause of death has still not been revealed. 

The Army veteran previously vowed to commit suicide in 2013, but later changed his mind to spend more time with family. 

Iraq War Army veteran Tomas Young (pictured) died Monday after an injury sustained in the conflict left him quadriplegic 

Young became a outspoken critic of the Iraq War after getting severely injured just five days after arriving in the Middle Eastern nation in 2004 

On his return from Iraq, Young became the subject of 2008 documentary 'Body of War' 

Young enlisted in the Army two days after September 11, 2001, wanting to take vengeance against the terrorist cells in Afghanistan that helped organize the attacks.

But instead he was deployed to Iraq in 2004, and just five days after arriving in the Middle Eastern country, was shot in the chest during an insurgent attack in Sadr City. 

That severe injury left Young paralyzed from the neck down, a quadripeligic.

After his return home, Young became one of the first critics of the Iraq War and gained notoriety in 2008 as the subject of the documentary film 'Body of War' by  Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue. 

On Monday, Donahue told BillMoyers.com that Young was a 'bright light' and 'talented young man'.  

'He was a political animal and he had a political statement that he wanted to make,' Donahue said. 'Tomas wanted people to know that this is the drama being played out in houses across the country occupied by thousands of young men and women who fought in the war.'

Last year, to mark the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, Young sent a letter to former President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, criticizing their motives motives behind the Iraq War. 

'I write this letter, my last letter, to you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. I write not because I think you grasp the terrible human moral consequences of your life lies, manipulation and thirst for wealth and power,' the letter read. 

'I write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have done.

The cause of Young's death was not immediately known. He previously planned to commit suicide by stopping his feeding tube, but later changed his mind to spend more time with his wife Claudia Cuellar (pictured together in March 2013 above) 

'You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans – my fellow veterans – who’s future you stole.'

That letter was supposed to be Young's last, as he vowed to stop taking his medication or feeding tube in an attempt to commit suicide. 

But Young later changed his mind, telling Democracy Now that he wanted to spend more time with his family. 

'I want to spend as much time as possible with my wife, and no decent son wants his obituary to read that he was survived by his mother,' he said at the time.

Young is survived by his wife Claudia Cuellar.
