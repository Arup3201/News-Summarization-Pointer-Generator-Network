The Americans admitted they may have inadvertently encouraged the Argentinians to invade the Falkland Islands, it emerged last night.

The former head of the CIA privately confessed that Argentina may wrongly have believed its  support for US covert operations in Central  America would mean Washington's 'acquiescence' for the 1982 invasion.

In fact, despite friction between London and Washington, the Pentagon provided vital behind-the-scenes support for the British military to retake the islands.

But newly declassified files reveal 
fears at the heart of US intelligence that a misunderstanding over US 
foreign policy could have led Buenos Aires to believe an invasion would 
not upset Washington.

Just
 over a month after the Argentinian surrender in June 1982, Sir Nicholas
 Henderson – then about to retire as UK ambassador in Washington – 
recalled conversations with CIA director William Casey in a 'valedictory
 telegram' to his Foreign Office bosses in London.

Sir
 Nicholas wrote: 'It is relevant that Mr William Casey, the head of the 
CIA, who was closely concerned in Cabinet discussion on this subject, 
has implied to us privately that he thinks the Argentinians may well 
have been led up the wrong path.

'They may have believed that their support for the US in covert operations in Central America was more important to the US than in fact it was, and could be expected to earn them American acquiescence in forward policy elsewhere.'

Sir Nicholas also recalled handing US Secretary of State Alexander Haig a piece of paper detailing British evidence of Argentina's intention to invade on April 2, 1982. 

He said: 'Mr Haig's reaction to the information I had given him was electric.'

Sir Nicholas added: 'He wanted us to win and would have been horrified if the Argentinians had got away with it.'
