Tottenham’s new coaches were put through the customary-but-embarrassing initiation ceremony after joining the club this summer.

Kyle Walker captured the video, and duly uploaded the video to his Instagram account.

While new manager Mauricio Pochettino is not seen, the video shows three of his most trusted colleagues, whom he had worked with at Espanyol and Southampton.

Tone-deaf? Tottenham's new coaching staff sang as part of their initiation at the club during pre-season

On the right-hand side is Miguel D’Agostino, Pochettino’s Argentine compatriot, the club’s new first-team coach. The 42-year-old had a journeyman playing career, seeing him play in his native Argentina, Ecuador, Honduras and the lower echelons in Spain and France.

In the centre of the video is Jesus Perez, with the Spaniard acting as Tottenham’s assistant head coach, having previously been Pochettino’s assistant manager when at the South Coast club.

The final man to appear, on the left-hand side, is Toni Jimenez. He was appointed the club’s goalkeeping coach this summer, with him having played three times for Spain during his heyday.

Their efforts seemed to entertain the playing squad, who were shown to be laughing and recording the incident, with the coaching staff awkwardly dancing around to some Latin American music.

Tottenham are currently on a pre-season tour of the USA, having drawn 3-3 to Seattle Sounders last Saturday in their first fixture.

They travel to Toronto on Thursday, where they will come up against former striker Jermain Defoe, as well as ex-centre back Ryan Nelsen in the dugout.
