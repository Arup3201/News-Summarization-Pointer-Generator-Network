A vintage Maserati super car has sold for a record-breaking £4 million - almost doubling the record for the iconic Italian manufacturer.

The rare 1955 Maserati 300S was snapped up at a British auction on Friday after a bidding frenzy in which the price escalated far beyond the previous record of £2.25 million.

One of the most desirable of all 1950s competitive two-seaters, it was described by racing legend Sir Stirling Moss as 'one of the easiest, nicest, best balanced racing cars ever made'.

Rare sale: Bonhams auctioned off the 1955 Maserati 300S Sports-Racing Spider at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on Friday

Legendary: Co-driven by Bill Spear and Sherwood Johnston in the 1955 Sebring 12-Hours race, the Maserati is part of racing history

The bright red convertible was the third of its kind ordered by Briggs Swift Cunningham, an American collector, for his friend and racing driver Bill Spear.

It was driven by Spear and Sherwood Johnston in the American round of the FIA Sports Car World Championship in which they came third after a Jaguar D-type and a Ferrari. 

Cutting-edge for its time, it was featured in the August 1955 issue of the prestigious Sports Cars Illustrated.

Bill Spear sold the car in 1956 to Joe Giubardo of Long Island in USA, who was murdered by two assailants at his home in 1964.

It was then preserved by Joel Finn, a sports writer, from 1964 to 1986.

The Maserati was then acquired by German doctor Thomas Bscher who took great care in looking after it.

It was sold to the current vendor around seven years ago.

It sold for the world record price at an auction in Goodwood, near Chichester in West Sussex, on Friday.

James Knight, Bonhams Group Motoring Director, said: 'In collecting terms, sports racing cars of the 1950s are the most coveted of all.

'The competition between the great marques from this period, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Jaguar, Maserati, is as fierce today as it was then. The Maserati 300S is right up there among the greats.'

Biggest seller: The Mercedes-Benz W196 driven by Formula 1 legend Juan Manuel Fangio fetched £19.6 million at Goodwood

'A car equally at home on road or track, offering impeccable handling and crucially able to accommodate two in comfort, it is the perfect all-rounder.

'It is eligible for all the great historic events, including the Mille Miglia, Le Mans Classic and Goodwood Revival.'

The biggest seller at the Bonhams Goodwood Festival of Speed was a 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 at £19,601,500.
