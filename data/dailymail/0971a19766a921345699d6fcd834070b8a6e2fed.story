A friend says Heidi denies she and her bodyguard were romantically involved while she was with Seal

Heidi and her bodyguard are currently calling their relationship 'undefined'

Friend of the supermodel says it is 'sad' that Seal is making these accusations

When they split up their seven year marriage in January, the world was shocked.

Heidi Klum and Seal by all accounts appeared happy, renewing their wedding vows every year and putting on plenty of red-carpet PDA's.

But now the Kiss From A Rose singer has sensationally revealed that the 39-year-old German supermodel was having an affair with her bodyguard BEFORE the couple broke up.

Did Heidi cheat? Heidi Klum's estranged husband Seal claims that she cheated on him by having an affair with her bodyguard before they separated in January this year

The 49-year-old made the claims last night to TMZ, after pictures emerged this week of his estranged wife cavorting on the beach with her bodyguard. 

Seal told TMZ that the former Victoria's Secret Angel was having an affair with the security guard before they separated earlier this year.

When initially asked what he thought about his former wife moving on with the heavily tattooed man, Seal said: Whilst I didn't expect anything better from him, I would of thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help.

'But I guess you all now have the answer you have been looking for for the last seven months.'

The British singer added that his top priority was his children's well-being. The singer has three biological children with the Project Runway host, including Henry, six, Johan, five,  and Lou, two. As well as Leni, eight, whom he formally adopted.

'That's what happens when two people separate, they move on and generally meet other people in their lives,' he said.

'I certainly don't expect Heidi to all of a sudden become a nun, but as always my main priority is the emotional well-being of my children, and to be quite honest if there is going to be someone else there in their lives, I would much rather it was a familiar face.'

Romantic getaway: Seal's sensational revelations come

to be her bodyguard during a sun-soaked holiday in Sardinia, Italy

Close: It
 would appear that things are getting serious between the two – which is
 hardly a surprise seeing as they already knew each other so well

According to TMZ, Heidi today denied that she cheated on Seal with her bodyguard.

The website reports that the supermodel told a friend that while she was still with Seal, the pair's relationship was 'strictly professional.'

However, since splitting with the singer in January, Heidi has gotten 'very close' to her security guard.

Heidi's friend explained to TMZ that he has been helping her get through her separation from Seal.

The couple are now said to classing their relationship as 'undefined'.

Heidi's pal said she is not surprised that Seal would make these kinds of accusations.

'It’s sad but not surprising that he would resort to making excuses for their divorce when the real reason is looking him in the mirror,' they told TMZ.

Seal's sensational revelations come 
after pictures emerged this week of Heidi cavorting around with a man believed 
to be her bodyguard during a sun-soaked holiday in Sardinia, Italy.

She was seen going topless and reclining on a sunlounger with the man in question at a swimming pool, looking loved up.

The
 pair then showed they have developed a close relationship as Heidi 
massaged suncream into her tattooed companion’s shoulders while they 
took a dip and later floated around on a lilo.

It
 would appear that things are getting serious between the two – which is
 hardly a surprise seeing as they already knew each other so well.

A lot to talk about: The pair chatted all throughout the afternoon

As well as enjoying some romantic alone time by the pool the duo hit the beach with three of Heidi’s children and Heidi’s bodyguard has even met the in-laws in the form of her parents Gunther and Erna.

Youngsters Johan, Leni, and Henry, were all on hand for the trip with their famous mother, and were seen playing on the beach together during a day out - while Lou was spotted in Erna's arms later.

The bodyguard, who has worked for Heidi since she was still married to Seal, seemed to be getting on well with the children as they larked around together on the sand before he gave Heidi a tender hug.

However even during the family day out it seems the two couldn’t get enough of each other.

They took some time out to go and perch on a rock for a private chat and were very hands on with one another.

While Seal is not happy about the couple's union, it appears that he has also moved on his love life with a new partner.

Last month he was seen cosying up to a pretty bikini clad brunette on a yacht – also in Sardinia.

Seal and Heidi announced their split in January after seven years of marriage and filed for divorce three months later.

While their split was initially amicable, it seems things may have turned sour for the pair in the divorce.

A source told Star magazine that the supermodel is fuming at her former flame after he reportedly used intimate shots of the children in an ad campaign without her permission.

An insider told the publication via Radar Online: ‘Heidi felt that the children had gone through enough since their parents split, and she didn’t want their private moments out there for the world to see.

‘But Seal maintained he had every right to use his personal photos —  and, moreover, that it was a done deal and out of his hands.'

The model allegedly hired a lawyer to demand that the company, Leica digital, take down the video – and it was retraced days later.
