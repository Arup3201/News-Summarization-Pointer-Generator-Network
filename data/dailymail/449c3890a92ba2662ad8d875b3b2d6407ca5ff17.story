A 62-year-old skydiver is being treated for burns after landing on power lines during a parachute jump.

The skydiver had to be airlifted to hospital at the weekend after landing on the power lines next to a busy road near Sacramento.

Friends of Mark Elizondo say he is an experienced skydiver who had taken part in several jumps on Sunday, before falling on the power lines at about 2pm.

'It’s a freak thing,' Bill Dause, who owns the Lodi Parachute Center, said. 'He’s jumped here before. He’s 
made several jumps today and just did something wrong.'

Mr Elizondo's wife, Raedell, said he had been practicing routines with 14 others when the accident happened.

She described her husband, who she met while skydiving, as experienced and said he had made more than 1,000 parachute jumps.

Mr Dause told KCRA: 'For some reason he just went two far downwind and unfortunately the power line was below him when he turned around and tried to come back.'

Witnesses said Mr Elizondo, from Utah, was conscious but had been burned and was in shock when emergency services arrived.

Lieutenant Michael van Grouwt added that Mr Elizondo was alert and talking as he was carried away on a stretcher.

'He was fairly stable,' Lieutenant van Grouw told the Recordnet.

Mr Dause said wind was unlikely to have led to the accident at the weekend, but other skydivers at the center disagreed.

'It’s happened before and that’s 
strictly the pilot of the parachute,' Ed Barr said. 'The wind today 
makes it even worse.'

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the accident and will check the condition of the parachute and whether it was packed properly, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said.

FAA records show that the agency recommended citations against the parachute center in 2010 and 2011 for failing to maintain aircraft equipment, according to the Los Angeles Times.

An independent instructor at the center also faced the possibility of a FAA fine last year over allegedly not fastening a harness to a student properly during a tandem jump.

A video of Laverne Everett celebrating her 80th birthday with a tandem jump shows her slipping out of the harness. However, she landed safely and refused to criticize her instructor, according to the Modesto Bee.

Mr Elizondo, from Utah, is still being treated for burns in hospital.

Fellow skydiver Bill Stanley said: 'Basically, any sport has risks. People get killed in any sport that exists. Quite honestly, my drive out here is more frightening.'

Mr Dause added that he could remember only other accident involving power lines since starting his business.
