Some four decades ago, an Alabama couple decided to build their home underground to beat the high price of fuel during the oil crisis of the 1970s.

Now Jim Mortenson and wife, Mickey, are still happily nestled in their extravagant bamboo-lined bunker in Bagely, having raised two children there and, not only, saved on energy costs but survived scores of savage storms.

During the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, the Mortenson's, like the rest of the United States, were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage.

Then Mr Mortenson read a magazine article about how underground living reduced the cost of heating and cooling and they were intrigued.

'We told our families, and they didn't tell us we were crazy,' he laughed in an interview with The Daily Mountain Eagle. 'We were young and didn't know what we were doing.'

The couple set to work in 1975, when their daughter Terra, was born, building the intriguing residence themselves, mostly on weekends.

They moved in eight years later, in 1983 -- the year their son, Joshua, was born. And even then the house was 'a work in progress.'

'By then, I think the inspector just felt sorry for us so he let us move in,' Mr Mortenson, who is now a grandparent, told The Eagle.

The house is constructed of concrete walls that are heavily waterproofed.

The roof area is decorated with tropic plants, such as banana trees and several types of elephant ears and bamboo, which Mr Mortenson started growing commercially 15 years ago and now ships all over the country.

The only help the couple hired was a plumber, a concrete block layer, and someone to smooth the concrete floors and roof slab of the 2,500 square foot house.

Everything else, they did themselves, according to an earlier article from AL.com.

As for energy efficiency, Mr Mortenson said the home is easy and cheap to cool in the summer though humidity can be a problem.

The couple installed a furnace a few years ago to heat the property They also have underground power and utility lines.

But Mickey Mortenson said the shelter the home provides from wild weather was a huge benefit they overlooked.

'I didn't realize how much I'd appreciate the fact that it's storm proof,' she said.

'These last few tornadoes I tell the kids to come down when ever there's a bad storm. We usually have a houseful of people when the weather's really bad.'

Mr Mortenson still marvels at the house the couple built so boldly all those years ago, after simply reading book after book on architecture and construction.

'I was in my 20s,' he said. 'There is something wonderful about youth - you just get up and go. It was fun in a way.'
