Revealed: A newly released autopsy report on Ezell Ford, 25, revealed he was shot three times by LAPD officers, including once in the back, on August 11

An autopsy report released Monday shows that an unarmed and mentally ill 25-year-old black man killed in a confrontation with LAPD this summer was shot three times, including in his right side, right arm and his back.

The report on the autopsy of Ezell Ford by the Los Angeles County coroner's office had been ordered withheld by police for months to avoid tainting potential witness statements.

Ford was unarmed when police confronted him on a street near his home August 11. Police said officers tried to speak to him but ended up in a struggle and shot him when he tried to grab an officer's gun.

The autopsy report stated that a muzzle imprint was found around the back wound and coroner's investigators noted abrasions to Ford's left hand, forearm and elbow.

Toxicology tests showed Ford had marijuana in his system at the time of his death. 

Steve Lerman, an attorney for Ford's parents, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Ford's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit and $75 million claim against the city.

More protests were planned for Monday afternoon following release of the report. 

The suit said two gang officers involved in the shooting - Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas - knew Ford from the neighborhood and were aware he had mental problems.

The suit also claimed that the city, LAPD and 10 unnamed superiors or other officers were part of a culture that tolerated civil rights violations, including racial profiling and excessive force against blacks.

The withholding of the autopsy report became an issue itself, but in November, Mayor Eric Garcetti promised that it would be released before year's end.

The report was being withheld so as to enable the corroboration of possible witness statements, he has said.

Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said in a statement that the autopsy presented only 'one set of facts among many hundreds being collected and assessed in the ongoing investigation.'

'LAPD officers are put directly in harm's way every day as they face complex situations, unthinkable dangers and split-second decisions while protecting the residents of Los Angeles,' Izen said. 'No officer goes to work with the intent of using force, much less deadly force, but force may become necessary when there is an objectively reasonable certainty that there could be injury to themselves or someone else. As tragic as these situations are, law enforcement officers absolutely have the right to defend their life or the life of another.'

Ford's death drew some 500 demonstrators to police headquarters the Sunday after the shooting. It followed the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson.

Grand juries decided not to bring charges against that policeman, nor against a white officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man in New York City.

The LAPD said no officer was hurt in the incident, and Ford, who was identified by family members, died in hospital. 

Demonstrators rally against the Missouri grand jury's decision to not indict Darren Wilson for his fatal shooting of Michael Brown, in front of a mural of Ezell Ford, on the corner of Broadway and 65th Street in Los Angeles, California December 1. Ford, 25, was killed by police in Los Angeles on August 11, two days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by Darren Wilson
