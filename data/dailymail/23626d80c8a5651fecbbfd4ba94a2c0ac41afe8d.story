A mother and her teenage daughter from Connecticut who were facing the prospect of being made homeless, have been saved after the girl blogged about the family business on Tumblr.

Danielle Walters, 14, found out her mom had been laid off from her job working in a bank, so she took it upon herself to try and boost the small craft business ran by her mother in her spare time.

In a desperate heartfelt plea to generate some interest, and allay fears that the two could lose their home, she posted about the company, Suffield Sundries, which sells artisan candles and soaps.

Business partners: Danielle David (left) wrote a Tumblr posting encouraging users to visit her mom Noelle's (right) website. The business ran out of stock within days after more than 200 orders were placed

Cry for help: The original posting complete with business card and website address that led to so many orders being placed

'My mom recently got fired from her job, my step-dad moved out and we don't have enough money to keep living where we are. She has a small business where she sells candles, soaps and soon body spray,' the posting began.

‘All I want is for [my mother's] business to get big and noticed a lot more,’  Danielle wrote.

'This is what she wanted to do when she was younger, and even today. Make candles, soaps, etc. She loves this. She hated her old job as a banker and she hated retail. I want her to be happy.'

'Buying from her website would mean a lot but I am not asking you too (sic)'

Selling out: Danielle's mother's small online business, Suffield Sundries, sells artisan candles and soaps and is hosted on the e-commerce crafts site, Etsy

Unknown influence: Noelle, Danielle's mom, had no idea her daughter had made the heartfelt online plea. Orders were coming in by the minute and soon the company ran out of stock

On the hunt: Despite the spike in orders, Mrs Walters-Davis says that after being laid off from her job in a bank she is still looking for a full-time position to help look after her four kids

The post included a snapshot of the 
business card, and requested that others reblog the picture to ‘help my 
mom's business get out there.’

To
begin with, there weren’t many responses but within a week her mother 
Noelle Walters-Davis, sold her entire stock of 200 soaps with up to 
10,000 customers viewing her website each day.

Speaking
to the Daily Dot, Mrs Walters-Davis said she didn’t know anything about
her daughters PR efforts until she was told about the girls 
thoughtfulness on the company’s Facebook page.

‘We were both shocked at how things blew up on Saturday. Orders just kept coming in one right after the other, and she and I would just look at each other in amazement.’

Despite selling out of her stock and with orders coming in for yet more cute soaps and smellies, Mrs Waters-Davis says that she and her four kids are not yet ‘in the clear’ and she is looking for a new full-time job.

Since launching her store three years ago Mrs Walters-Davis said that sales had been 'pretty much non-existent' averaging only one Etsy shop view daily and with never more than two shoppers at her store at the same time.

Now she has had more than 12,000 people view her online shop and at one point had 600 potential shoppers visiting at once. She has also acquired 1,800 fans on the store's Facebook page.

Showing her gratitude at the level of interest in her company, Mrs Walter-David posted a message on her page: 'I am beyond grateful for the out pouring of kindness and support from the Tumbler (sic) community! My heartfelt THANK YOU goes out to each and every one of you!'
