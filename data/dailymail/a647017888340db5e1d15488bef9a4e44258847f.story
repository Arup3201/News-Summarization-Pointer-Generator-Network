Bust enhancers, bust reducers, corsets, and waist control garments - it appears that women have tried every trick in the book, a sometimes very painful book, in their quest for the 'glorious figure of youth.'

A set of rare historical documents reveal the ever changing tactics and technology used by British women to disguise or shift their bumps and curves over the past 80 years. 

They tell the story, often in painful detail, of how underclothing was deployed across the decades to help women appear trimmer.

Vintage: An old catalogue from 1950 released by JD Williams reveals exactly what lengths women went to in their quest for the 'glorious figure of youth'

Corsets, girdles, and semi-rigid underwear, which relied upon sturdy straps rather than more comfortable elastic are all described in the archive, just released by JD Williams, one Britain’s oldest retailers. 

The archive goes on to show all of the most popular shapewear garments sold by  for the next fourteen decades.

Tricks of the trade: As these catalogues reveal, women used bust enhancers, bust reducers, corsets, and waist control garments to trim their figures

Sucked in: Women were seemingly big fans of girdles - these firm controls from a 1970s catalogue promised to flatten tummies for a sleeker, slimmer silhouette

The archive shows how the lingerie industry was in the forefront of using cutting edge, newly discovered, man-made materials, deploying them in designs long before the rest of the market realised their potential.

It shows that subtle but incremental changes show the transformation to today’s shapewear, which is now developed using highly technical, computer designed architecture.

Components are now engineered to combat specific stresses and stretches, spreading the load across the entire garment for an 'incredible smooth often seamless result,' according to JD Williams.

Modern technology is now geared towards strength and comfort focussing on fabric advances such as powermesh and stretch lace, as well as ranges such as a ‘No VPL’ knicker that uses bonded silicone at the leg seam to ensure underwear is not visible through clothing.

JD Williams has released the rare archive, complete with illustrations, to coincide with Body Confidence Week.

The retailer said it wants emphasise the fact that even apparently slender celebrities such as Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow use shape wear to boost their confidence at important events.

It added that over 60 per cent of British women are dealing with body image issues, and sales of shapewear at JD Williams up 40 per cent in 2014.

A spokesperson said: 'We often take the smooth, comfortable, sophistication of today’s modern shapewear for granted.

'However this archive shows the sacrifices that women have made in the past so that today’s generation can put their most natural looking, smoothest silhouette forward.'
