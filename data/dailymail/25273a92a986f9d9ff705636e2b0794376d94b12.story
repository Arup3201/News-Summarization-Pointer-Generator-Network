It was the moment the world had been waiting for. Or at least the large portion of the world who harbour an obsession with the Kardashians.

Kim Kardashian made her first appearance in public as a mother. And while she kept her style dressed down and sober (is this the new relaxed Kim?), she sure let her accessories do the talking.

Not for Kim the everyday nappy bag from Cath Kidston. For her first appearance en famille with baby North and 36-year-old rapper boyfriend Kanye, Kim toted a £20,000 Hermes bag, stuffed full, no doubt, with Swarovski pacifiers, Dior baby bottles and cashmere babygros.

But more striking than the Hermes nappy bag were the matching moccasin boots that Kim and Kanye were sporting.

and baby North, Kim dressed down - but she let her accessories do the

Kanye's

Fringe theatre: Kanye's suede boots bore a remarkable resemblance to Kim's, and both saw their fringing swing at their ankles, creating added drama to otherwise simple looks

Eschewing heels for once, Kim wore on her feet a pair of tan fringed Minnetonka boots in suede - and Kanye wore his own black fringed pair.

It is no secret that the two have long been performing a sort of style merge.

Ever since the two began dating in the first half of 2012, Kim's wardrobe began to go through something of a metamorphosis - and Kanye made no secret of the fact that he was behind it.

In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim was in tears as Kanye went through her wardrobe with his assistant, throwing out dozens of items of clothes - some she said were her favourite.

'I like that top, it's like 'Yo, I'm getting on best dressed lists now. I'm stepping all into this territory,' he says as he bins heaps of clothes.

Gradually the skin-tight, plunging dresses made way for leather, lace and Lanvin.

Push-up bras were out; natural cleavage in.

Kim's personal stylist: In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians last year, Kanye and his assistant went through Kim's wardrobe, throwing out all the clothes he deemed unstylish, saying now Kim would be 'getting on the best dressed lists'

Doppelgangers: Kim and Kanye have often been spotted wearing matching clothes - indeed, Kanye has taken responsibility for styling Kim since the two became a couple in 2012

As the transformation took hold, it was clear just how much influence Kanye had over his girlfriend when the two started making public appearances dressed eerily similarly.

Matching leather outfits, top-to-toe black, co-ordinated urban sportswear...

Where Kanye shopped, Kim followed. And now it seems her post-baby wardrobe will be no different.

Kanye has spoken in the past of wanting Kim to dress and style herself more 'naturally'. 'I grew up with women in 80s magazines,' he has commented previously. 

With flat, comfortable boots and a super-luxe bag in an understate colour (Kim's other oversized Hermes bag is bright orange), could this be the new Earth Mother Kim?

Only time will tell.

Stylish yet comfortable: Kim paired her Minnetonka boots with leggings and denim shirt, while baby North's outfit remained a mystery as the baby was shrouded in a muslin
