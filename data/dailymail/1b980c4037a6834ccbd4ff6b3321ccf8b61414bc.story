It's obvious to choose a flight based on the cheapest option.

But with so many add-on fees to consider as additional to the cost of a ticket, Business Insider reporter Sara Silverstein decided to go looking for the best price overall.

The journalist decided to book flights for the Fourth of July weekend - one of the busiest American travel times - from New York to Los Angeles, to determine which airline offers the greatest deal.

What she found was the most popular carriers, such as Delta and United, had the costliest extras.

Don't forget the add-ons: Business Insider conducted a report into the cheapest airline to fly from New York to Los Angeles on Fourth of July weekend in terms of overall fees, and determined SouthWest offered the best price

The report found that JetBlue and Southwest Airlines did not charge customers to check in one item of luggage.

However American Airlines, Delta and United all charged $25 to check a bag.

Picking a seat is also an important and expensive option.

SouthWest determines their seating arrangements on the order that people check in, but for $12.50 you can reserve a spot toward the front of the plane.

JetBlue offer more spacious seats for $80.

United has economy plus for $99, while Delta has economy comfort for $99.

American Airlines has the fewest available complimentary seats.

Upgraded seats cost between $66 and $86.

SouthWest Airlines charged the least amount of additional fees overall, Business Insider concluded

The cost for a good seat and a checked seat one-way on Delta and/or United is almost $250.

Silverstein determined that SouthWest were the best all-inclusive option.

However that is without being able to choose a seat.

Delta and United were the most expensive for Fourth of July when it came to additional fees.
