A heroic young girl who put her life on the line to stop her sister from being run over has been included in a list celebrating people who make the UK a happier place.

Ramona Gibbs is one of 100 unsung heroes celebrated in the Independent on Sunday Happy List, which aims to be an alternative to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Then six, Ramona put herself in front of a car to stop her younger sister Trixie from being run over by a vehicle that drove onto the pavement outside their Bristol home.

She was left with liver and lung 
damage, a broken rib and leg, bruising to her pelvis and internal 
bleeding, and had five operations during 16 days in hospital. Trixie 
only suffered a scratch.

The youngster was also awarded a Children's and Young People Award by Somerset and Avon police in Portishead last year.

her mother Sally, a primary school teacher, said last year: 'It’s really amazing what Ramona did - it must have been pure instinct.

'If it was not for her, Trixie would have been killed. All the eyewitnesses said that the car was heading straight for her.'All of Ramona’s injuries were abdominal, which would have been head height for Trixie.

'I can’t even think about what might have happened if Ramona hadn’t done what she did.'

Recovery: Ramona spent 16 days at Bristol Children's Hospital

Sally added: 'Trixie remembers there 
was an accident and that Ramona was very badly hurt. She also remembers 
being pushed by Ramona which is the reason we know how it happened.

'I remember her saying that Ramona 
had pushed her. She was actually quite cross about it - she didn’t 
realise that Ramona had done something that had saved her life.'

Highlighting the stories of people 
who have improved the lives of others, the list also features soldier 
Carl Taylor, who saved three Afghan children from the Tailban.

The Corporal, of 3rd Battalion The 
Mercian Regiment and from Birmingham, won a Military Cross for running 
80 feet to assist the boys after they were trapped behind a wall.

Flood rescuers David and Cameron Dunn
got a mention for saving a pensioner who was caught in deep water in 
Keynsham, Somerset, last November.

Ellis Blake and Ariana Webley also made their way into the happiness chart for saving a life.

Aged 20 at the time, the cousins 
stopped a man from bleeding to death after a machete attack at a 
Bimingham bus stop by using towels and a bag of frozen Brussels sprouts.

An amputee from Truro, Cornwall, has 
been celebrated for designing a fitness DVD for others who have lost 
limbs, the elderly and overweight.

Leanne Grose, who lost her left leg 
to a rare form of bone cancer, has also written an autobiography and 
given birth to the child she could not have.

And social worker Shahida Choudhry, 
from Birmingham, started a petition for Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani 
school girl shot in the head by the Taliban, to receive the Nobel Peace 
Prize.

The list, which is published in the 
Independent on Sunday today, also celebrates those who have improved 
people’s lives through volunteering, fundraising, mentoring and charity 
work.
