A bull on its way to be butchered made a run for it but after leading pursuers on a six mile chase through a Chinese city, ended up being crushed against a tree by an SUV.

The animal was on its way to be slaughtered when it leaped off the back of a truck it was being transported on and ran away. 

It injured four people on its rampage through Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province. 

The bruised and bloodied bull was finally brought to a halt by an SUV which crushed it up against a tree

It is unclear whether the bull survived its ordeal, which came at the end of a six mile chase through Chengdu

The animal lies badly injured after it took eight policemen and a private car to bring it down

Owner Zhou, his wife and their assistants chased the 400kg animal along busy main roads for more than six miles before it finally stopped in the downtown area.

With the bull in a rage Zhou called for help from police. A total of eight officers were sent to the site to deal with the emergency. 

A passing private car also joined the force and hit the bull several times, which injured it but still did not stop it. 

One incredible image showed the bull being struck from behind and flying through the air as it ran along a busy road with cars either side.

A police officer later fired four shots at the bull and another drove an SUV into it and crushed it against a tree.  

An elderly man, a young child and a police officer were all injured in the incident.

They were all sent to hospital for medical treatment.
