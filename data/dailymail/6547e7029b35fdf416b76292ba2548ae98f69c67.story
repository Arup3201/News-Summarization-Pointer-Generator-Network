It was the wedding of their dreams, at a beachfront Caribbean hotel surrounded by family and friends.

But while most of the other hotel guests happily congratulated newlyweds Kate and Robert Whitaker, one was left distinctly unimpressed.

In a scathing 560-word review on the TripAdvisor website, a holidaymaker at the Mango Bay on Barbados vents her frustration at showjumper Mr Whitaker, 32, a member of the Whitaker equestrian dynasty, and his new wife, 37.

Beachfront wedding: Robert and Kate Whitaker's wedding at Mango Bay, Barbados last month angered a fellow hotel guest to the point where she wrote a scathing review on Tripadvisor

She does not name them but refers to a ‘very well-known showjumper’ and his ‘exceedingly loud Essex fiancee’ before complaining about their guests ‘causing havoc to the ambiance, with their middle of the night drinking and shouting’.

The identity of the unhappy guest at the 76-room hotel – which costs around £1,500 per person for seven nights – is a mystery, but her TripAdvisor profile says she is a woman aged over 65 living in East Yorkshire. She has the user name adrienne3.

Mr and Mrs Whitaker – who live in Kent and are not from Essex – were alerted to the review by one of their bridesmaids back in Britain.

‘So many people congratulated us the following day at breakfast, but obviously we must have upset this one person,’ said Mrs Whitaker.

The review begins: ‘After three days at Mango Bay I was ready to give the hotel five stars. However the impact of a so-called upper-crust wedding party spoiled the serenity.’ 

Mr and Mrs Whitaker were joined by 60 friends and family, including Mr Whitaker’s father John, 59, the British equestrian and former Olympian, and his uncle Michael, 54, also a showjumper

Happy day: Mr Whitaker and his wife, who have a one-year-old daughter, Evie, married on January 13

Accusations Guest called Mrs Whitaker an ‘exceedingly loud Essex fiancee’ and said the wedding made her stay at the hotel feel 'more like a week with a load of lager louts'

The reviewer says she asked a security guard to tell the party to be quiet but was told ‘I can’t do that’, she claimed. 

In her TripAdvisor review of the hotel, the pensioner calling herself adrienne3 wrote:

‘After three days at Mango Bay I was ready to give the hotel five stars. However the impact of a so-called upper-crust wedding party spoiled the serenity.

‘A very well-known showjumper (you know who you are) arrived with his exceedingly loud Essex fiancee and 80 guests causing complete havoc to the ambience, with their middle of the night drinking and shouting etc.

‘A request to the security guard to ask them to be quiet was met with, “I can’t do that”.

‘When I mentioned it to Pedro in the morning, all he would say was that mine was not the only complaint.

‘Obviously the hotel were making an awful lot of money from this wedding but why should other guests have to suffer because of their obnoxious and rude behaviour.

‘It was more like a week with a load of Blackpool lager louts than a stay at a 4.5-star hotel.

‘The wedding of a Northern couple two days later was done in the best possible taste and no problems, as far as I am aware, was caused to the other guests.

‘Other than the presence of the gross Essex wedding party we had a wonderful time and possibly would return in the future.’

'When I mentioned it to Pedro in the morning, all he would say was that mine was not the only complaint,’ she wrote.

Complaining about ‘obnoxious and rude behaviour’, she adds: ‘It was more like a week with a load of Blackpool lager louts than a stay at a 4.5-star hotel.’ 

The writer praises the hotel itself but complains about the noise from the karaoke bar – although she does add: ‘But it is only on a Sunday night and not EVERY night as it was with the wedding crowd.’

Mr Whitaker, originally from Huddersfield, and his wife, who have a one-year-old daughter, Evie, married on January 13. 

They were joined by 60 friends and family, including Mr Whitaker’s father John, 59, the British equestrian and former Olympian, and his uncle Michael, 54, also a showjumper.

Last night Mrs Whitaker said: ‘There was not one Essex person there – not that there would have been a problem had there been. She stereotyped everyone.’

She said that while some of their party enjoyed drinks and dinner at the hotel during their holiday, the TripAdvisor comments were ‘quite far from the truth’.

 She also said they held their evening wedding reception at a nearby restaurant, not at the hotel.

‘I don’t believe anybody acted untoward, especially on the wedding day because it was the middle of the day and we went on elsewhere to drink and eat,’ she said.

The author of the review did not respond to a request for comment.
