A 72-year-old veteran beat off a 275-pound pickpocket with his cane last month after being targeted in suburban Detroit.

Security camera footage shows the moment Chet Dunham walks past 23-year-old Jeffrey Darnell Jones II after finishing breakfast on March 27.

Seconds later Jones reaches over into Dunham's back pocket, seemingly trying to steal the senior citizen's wallet.

But Mr Dunham quickly reacts, swinging around to hit Jones with his walking cane.

'I just hit him, that was it,' Mr Dunham told WDIV.

'There's nobody gonna have their hand in my pocket without me reacting. That's how fast it was, just seconds,' he added.

Mr Dunham's threatening stance caused Jones to back off and say: 'I was just kidding'.

After sizing Jones up, Mr Dunham decided he needed to get help and entered the adjacent Bank of America branch where a teller called 911.

A joke: Dunham quickly swings around and strikes Jones with his walking cane, causing the 23-year-old to back off and say: 'I was just kidding'

Arrested: Jones was quickly arrested and charged with attempted larceny from a person -  a five-year felony

Police soon arrived and arrested Jones outside the restaurant where Mr Dunham had just finished eating breakfast.

After he was arrested, Jones told authorities he was in the area for a doctor's appointment and was waiting for a ride home.

'I believe that to be true. But, whatever the reason he committed that act, I'm still not sure.' Detective Bryan Ford told Grosse Point News.

A review of the surveillance footage shows Jones was lingering in the same area for some 20 minutes before choosing Dunham as his target.

'He thought he was going to be an easy target but obviously he wasn't,' Detective Bryan Ford said.

'This guy's no Jack-be-nimble,' fellow Detective Lt Richard Rosati added.

Jones admitted to trying to steal the old man's wallet, and has since been charged with attempted larceny of a person - a five-year felony. 

He is being held on $5,000 bond at Wayne County Jail.

Authorities say Jones is unemployed and lives with his mother and younger brother.

He quit high school halfway through the 11th grade because 'it was too difficult'.
