Warning: Prime Minister David Cameron said he would target green levies and company profits to bring down energy bills

Huge rises in energy bills are ‘morally wrong’ at a time when costs for power firms are not rising, David Cameron said today.

The Prime Minister took aim at companies which have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days, as he promised ‘action’ to curb the profits of the Big Six energy firms.

It also emerged Number 10 want to cut the green levies on bills by £50, to counter claims the government is not acting to ease the rising cost of living.

The UK is second only to Estonia among European nations for the number of people who are struggling to pay their energy bills, according to research by the fuel poverty alliance Energy Bill Revolution.

ScottishPower yesterday became the latest firm to announce eye-watering price rises, warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks.

It follows Npower announcing a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas promising a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

At a press conference in Brussels, Mr Cameron was asked if the energy giants were ‘morally wrong’ to increase their costs, following rises by four of the Big Six firms.

Mr Cameron said: ‘On power bills I think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially, but we have to look at the causes of why bills are going up and act on those causes rather than just have some sort of blanket policy that doesn't work.

‘That's why I've identified, of the four parts to a bill - you've got the wholesale prices, the transmission costs, the green taxes and charges, and then you've got the profits that the companies are making - it's those last two where we need action.

‘So, on the profits you need more competition, you need more challenge, I want more companies in that sector, I want the competition in the market properly reviewed every year, and we will have that.

‘On the green charges, yes, we should be trying to roll the cost of those back, in the best way that we can because that is one of the things that has been adding to bills in recent years.’

Charges: Four of the Big Six energy firms have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days

The threat to target the profits of energy firms comes after former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Minister this week called for an ‘excess profits tax on the energy companies’ to claw back  money to money help for the elderly to keep warm this winter.

Mr Cameron has rejected the idea, insisting a review of competition in the industry, due to be announced next week, will bring more competitors into the market and p to cut bills.

The Prime Minister is also locked in negotiations with his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg over the future of green levies which push up bills by more than £100-a-year.

Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted he would not allow green levies to be scrapped altogether

Government insiders indicate that Mr 
Cameron wants any change to green levies to have a significant impact on
bills, and hope to be able to promise customers a reduction of at least
£50.

Mr Clegg today said he would not 
allow all green levies to be axed following the PM's surprise 
announcement earlier this week that ‘roll back’ the charges.

But they could be paid for from general taxation instead of added costs on energy bills.

The Liberal Democrat leader told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine: ‘Removing all the levies is an incredibly bad idea and I would never support it.

‘It's certainly not an idea which this coalition Government is going to put forward.’

Official advice issued by Public Health England (PHE) says people should keep their homes warm, with living room temperatures of 21C (70F) and bedrooms and the rest of the house heated to 18C (65F).

It says temperatures above this 'may waste money' but below this 'may risk your health'.

If people are unable to afford to heat all their rooms, they are advised to heat their living room during the day and bedrooms just before going to bed.

But Mr Clegg insisted: ‘I'm certainly not giving people advice on what to wear and what to do with their own thermostats.’

the cost of going green

The Prime Minister insisted that any action the Government took on green levies would be done in a transparent fashion.

He
repeated his assertion that Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze bills if he 
won power in 2015 was a ‘con’ because no politician could prevent 
fluctuations in the oil and gas markets.

‘What matters is getting to grips with the causes of things that are causing the bills to rise,’ he said.

‘That must be done in an open and transparent way, so that if you end what's causing the charge to rise that's transparent, if you move a charge from a bill to somewhere else that's transparent.

‘What is a con is saying “I'm going to cap energy prices” when actually you're not doing anything to deal with the reason why they are increasing.’

He said the British public are ‘basically very smart and they know that energy bills can go up when the world price of oil and gas goes up’.
