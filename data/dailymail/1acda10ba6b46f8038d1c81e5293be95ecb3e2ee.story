Two 160 million year old fossils found in China are from the earliest known tree-dwelling and subterranean mammals ever discovered. 

With claws for climbing and teeth adapted for a tree sap diet, Agilodocodon scansorius is the earliest-known tree-dwelling mammaliaform (long-extinct relatives of modern mammals). 

The other fossil, Docofossor brachydactylus, is the earliest-known subterranean mammaliaform, possessing multiple adaptations similar to African golden moles such as shovel-like paws.

With claws for climbing and teeth adapted for a tree sap diet, Agilodocodon scansorius is the earliest-known tree-dwelling mammaliaform (long-extinct relatives of modern mammals). The other fossil, Docofossor brachydactylus, is the earliest-known subterranean mammaliaform, possessing multiple adaptations similar to African golden moles such as shovel-like paws.

The earliest mammals are thought to have appeared roughly 200 million years ago, arriving on the scene during the Mesozoi cEra with dinosaurs ruling the land and flying pterosaurs keeping an eye out for a quick snack. 

The earliest-known bird did notappear until about 150 million years ago. 

Where they were found

Agilodocodon scansorius, an omnivore that lived about 165
million years ago, possessed paws with curved claws for
climbing, limb dimensions characteristic of other tree-dwelling
mammals and flexible elbow, wrist and ankle joints good for
scrambling up trees with agility.

Its spade-like front teeth, similar to some New World
monkeys today, allowed it to chew into bark and eat tree gum or
sap.

Docofossor, a mole-like insect-eater that lived about 160
million years ago, boasted shovel-like paws for digging, teeth
similar to later burrowing mammals that forage underground and
sprawling limbs ideal for underground movement.

University of Chicago paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo called
Docofossor a "dead ringer" for today's African golden mole.

Traits in Docofossor's fingers are so similar to that mole
that the researchers suspect the same genes may be responsible
even though the two creatures belong to different branches of
the mammalian family tree and are separated by 160 million
years.

The earliest mammals are thought to have appeared roughly
200 million years ago, arriving on the scene during the Mesozoic
Era with dinosaurs ruling the land and flying pterosaurs keeping
an eye out for a quick snack. 

The earliest-known bird did not
appear until about 150 million years ago.

"Before the 2000s, it was generally thought Mesozoic mammals
could not diversify much in the dinosaur-dominated ecosystem,"
Luo said.

Docofossor, a mole-like insect-eater that lived about 160million years ago, boasted shovel-like paws for digging, teethsimilar to later burrowing mammals that forage underground andsprawling limbs ideal for underground movement.

But Luo said this notion has been undercut by discoveries in
recent years of fossils of many Mesozoic mammals with numerous
specializations including swimming, tree-living and digging.

"Simply put, our distant mammalian relatives explored 
ecological niches that were just as varied and interesting as
many modern mammal groups," Luo said.

Agilodocodon and Docofossor both belonged to a long-extinct
early mammalian order called docodonts. Castorocauda, another
docodont living at about the same time in the Jurassic Period
whose fossil was unearthed in China in 2006, had beaver-like
traits tailored for an aquatic lifestyle.

The research was published in the journal Science. 

Stem mammaliaforms (also known as “stem mammals”) are long-extinct relatives The newly discovered  fossils show stem mammaliaforms had very diverse feeding and locomotor functions, and a much wider ecological divergence as a whole, despite the dominance of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic Era.
