After three previously unrealized opening dates starting as far back as 2006, One World Trade Center will finally open next week.

The long awaited opening will come Monday as the first tenants move into the $3.9 billion, 1,776-foot skyscraper.

Publishing giant Condé Nast and some 3,400 staffers will fill floors 20 through 44 starting Monday.

Finally: The new World Trade Center with all its spectacular views will finally open next week after years of unrealized opening dates and political wrangling

While Condé Nast is the building's largest tenant, other companies have also signed on. Major tenants include the government's General Services Administration, the China Center trade facility and the advertising firm Kids Creative.

Getting to this point was not a simple process. The original cost of the building doubled as the structure went up.

And the opening date, which was initially set in 2006, was first moved from 2006 to 2011, then 2012 and now to November 2014.

Condé Nast, and visitors for that matter, won't be able to take in the spectacular views of the 102nd floor's 120,000 square foot observation deck until spring 2015.

Breathtaking: Looking north, the view extends all the way to the Catskills in the distance

To the north and west, visitors will see the busy Hudson River and New Jersey beyond

Once spring finally comes, visitors willing to shell out $29 will be treated to an elevator ride 102 floors up, where they will be greeted with sweeping views of New York City. 

State and city officials held a news conference in September from the 67th floor of 4 World Trade Center, which opened in November.

A completed World Trade Center complex will create a vibrant district and make Lower Manhattan a business and shopping destination, they said.

Although costs soared and plans changed for 1 World Trade Center at the beginning of construction, it will open sometime this fall, Rechler said.

'We owed it to all those who perished' to persist and complete the building, Rechler said.

The center and a transportation hub will open in phases and may not have a grand opening, he said.

The observation deck at One World Trade Center won't open until 2015, but when it does visitors will be treated to spectacular views.

From the top, the rolling Catskill Mountains can be made out to the north.

South of the tower, viewers will be able to make out New Jersey.

Brooklyn is to the east, where the view extends to JFK Aiport, according to the New York Daily News.

To the west is the busy Hudson River.

Once spring finally comes, visitors willing to shell out $29 will be treated to an elevator ride 102 floors up, where they will be greeted with sweeping views of New York City
