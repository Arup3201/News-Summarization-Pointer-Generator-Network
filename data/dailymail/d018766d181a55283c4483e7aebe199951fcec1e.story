Steven Craig Vonk left his DNA behind at the crime scene

A bungling burglar has been jailed after leaving his DNA on a can of Carling at the scene of his crime.

Armed with lager, Steven Craig Vonk broke into a flat near his home in Brynmill, Swansea, last month. 

The 39-year-old fled the scene empty-handed after waking up the homeowner, leaving the beer behind. 

Forensic officers were able to trace the burglar through DNA left on the tin. 

He was sentenced to 876 days in prison for burglary and a further 12 weeks from a previous suspended sentence at Swansea Crown Court. 

Detective Inspector Mark Kavanagh, of Swansea CID, said disturbing a burglar was a terrifying experience for any householder.

'Fortunately in this case the victim was unharmed and no property was stolen,' he said.

'But when our investigation got under way it became apparent a can of lager had been left at the scene which did not belong to the victim.

'The can was forensically examined and contained the full DNA profile of Vonk. He was later traced and arrested for the burglary.

'Whenever a burglary is reported we use every tool available to us to try and identify a suspect.

'Forensic technology is an important way of catching burglary suspect and, in this case, leaving behind a can of lager has resulted in us putting the suspect before the court.'

The burglar was caught by police after leaving his can of Carling at the crime scene when the homeowner woke up
