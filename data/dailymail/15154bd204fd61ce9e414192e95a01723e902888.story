Two of America's top restaurants are set to adopt a new system that will force diners to pay for their meal when they book a reservation - in the hopes of curbing dinner cancelations.

New York's Per Se and Napa Valley's The French Laundry, both owned by acclaimed chef Thomas Keller, will begin using Tock, a booking system created by restaurateur Nick Kokonas that's slated to launch in early 2015.

Tock requires customers to reserve tables online and pay the full amount of the restaurant's prix fixe tasting menu - including service charges - in advance, so that the post-meal bill includes only drinks. Tickets are non-refundable.

Both of Mr Keller's famed restaurants offer extravagant eight-course tasting menus; the price of Per Se's is $310, while dinner at French Laundry costs $295.

Mr Kokonas began using a pilot version of the software in Alinea and Next, two Chicago establishments that he co-owns with Grant Achtaz, in 2012.

'Per Se and The French Laundry will work exactly like Alinea. Pre-purchase of the tasting menu, phone call to every guest,' he told Eater.

Other eateries that have tested an early version of Tock include San Francisco's Coi, Los Angeles' Trois Mec and Wylie Dufresne's recently closed New York spot WD~50.

Mr Kokonas will charge restaurants a $695 monthly fee for unlimited use of the program, which will help owners ensure that last-minute cancellations don't affect their profits.

Coi's owner, Bay Area chef Daniel Patterson, told the New York Times that Tock is perfect for his new restaurant Aster, which has only four seats and offers a tasting menu that features expensive ingredients such as spiny lobster.

'When there is a limited supply, Tock works really well,' he said.

Earlier this week, Mr Keller told Inside Scoop SF that the new system will improve the experience of booking reservations at his restaurants, which previously required diners to call a month in advance.

'Right now when you call for a reservation at 10 a.m., 90per cent of the time you’ll get a busy signal,' he said of French Laundry.

'Then the majority of our guests who get through get the response of "Sorry we’re booked." Now they are disappointed they didn’t get a reservations. This affords certainly more transparency and more opportunity to get a reservation without the frustration of calling and getting a busy signal.'
