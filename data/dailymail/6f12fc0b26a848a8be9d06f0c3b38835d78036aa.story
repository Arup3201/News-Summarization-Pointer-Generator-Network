If the £20,000 Harrods hamper had your mouth watering but left you feeling a little priced out of the market, this could be the solution.

It includes Grand Cru champagne, a magnificent 6.5kg Serrano ham, fine cheeses and meats – just the sort of produce you might have expected in the luxury collection unveiled by the Knightsbridge store last month.

However, this is the Aldi version and it comes with a £540.30 price tag – saving £19,459.70.

The contents of the Harrods hamper, highlighted by the Daily Mail in October, astounded and angered some readers.

In a time of austerity, when a five-year cost of living squeeze has meant hardship and sacrifices for many, the idea that shoppers might spend thousands on the ‘Decadence’ hamper seems remarkable.

But Harrods has experienced huge interest in the luxury collection given that some of its customers, including billionaire Russian oligarchs and Arab potentates, have come through the credit crunch largely unscathed.

Aldi, which has become Britain’s 
favourite budget retailer with sales up by more than 30 per cent in a 
year, responded by creating a cut-price version.

Food snobs may balk at the idea, but Aldi Christmas puddings recently beat the best that Harrods has to offer in blind taste tests by the Good Housekeeping Institute.

The supermarket has also collected more than 100 awards for its wines and spirits.

Retail analysts Verdict last week found the number of people using Aldi for their main weekly shop has leapt 31.7 per cent in a year.

Almost one in five customers are middle class or upper middle class – up from one in eight a year ago.
