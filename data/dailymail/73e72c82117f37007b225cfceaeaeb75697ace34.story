This is the shocking tweet from Justin Ross Harris to a friend on September 11 of last year that suggests his baby Cooper, then 13-month-old, was not sleeping to his satisfaction.

Of course, many parents of young babies have shared similar frustrations about wishing their babies would sleep through the night. But the shocking tweet from @rossharris: ‘NEW INVENTION: Snooze buttons on babies’ is shocking in light of the charges against Harris, who has been charged with leaving his son to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18, is alarming.

Harris, who describes himself as a 'web developer, musician and lead guitar @ Stonebridge Church' on his Twitter account, which he joined in July 2008, has a total of 22 tweets on his Twitter page, most talking about entering contests and his new coffee machine.

Turned away: Leanna Harris walks out of the Cobb County detention facility after being turned away from seeing her husband and accused killer of her son on Tuesday morning

Harris' wife Leanna was barred from visiting her husband on Tuesday when she attempted to see him in jail for the first time since shocking details of the alleged crime were revealed in court.

Harris refused to answer reporters' questions as she left the Cobb County detention facility in Marietta on Tuesday morning, where she'd spent 36 minutes according to WXIA, except to shake her head 'no' when asked if she'd seen her son's accused killer.

She appeared at least passably distraught as she got in the back seat of an unidentified woman's car, though questions have already begun to arise about her role in 22-month-old Cooper's June 18 death precisely because of her behavior.

Also on Tuesday, investigators took Justin Ross Harris' SUV back to the Home Depot parking lot to recreate details similar to the day when the child died.

Police revealed this week that 
Cooper had been switched out of his forward-facing new car seat weeks 
before his death - even though he was too big for his old one.

Harris
 was found dead in his rear-facing car seat in a parking lot in Cobb 
County, Georgia on June 18 - after sweltering inside for more than seven
 hours.

According to Cobb County, Georgia police detective Phil Stoddard, Harris told his wife, 'I dreaded how he would look,' when he 'discovered' his son's dead body.

Harris faces a 
murder charge but insists he mistakenly left his 22-month-old son inside
 the car before heading to work at Home Depot.

With the boy in the rear-facing seat, Harris would not have seen his child if he looked over towards it.

During
 a probable cause hearing on Thursday, Cobb County Police Detective Phil
 Stoddard testified that the boy was 'several inches' too big for the 
child seat, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Loss: Cooper Harris, pictured with his parents Justin Ross and Leanna, had been switched out of a seat that might have been easier for his father to see him in the back of the sweltering car

He added that the parents had bought a new, forward-facing child seat just six weeks ago but they switched back to his old seat for reasons that are not yet clear.

'Harris knew the specific make and model of the seat and what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it,' the warrants state.

'When the seat was inspected the straps for the seat were set on the lowest level for a small child.'

Harris told detectives his son was 'developing fine'.

Suspicions are also growing about what role Harris' wife may have played in the death.

Emotional: Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder

Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but she expressed little emotion throughout last weeks hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away.

Investigators also described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious.

When
 workers at her son's day care said that Cooper had never been dropped 
off, she calmly responded: ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There's 
no other explanation,’ Stoddard said.

When
 reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been 
charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him: 'Did you say too much?' 
according to Stoddard.

When she called home June 18 with the 
grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone 
saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’

Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’

Familiar face: Leanna Harris, right, wife of 
Justin Ross Harris, arrives for her husband's bond hearing in Cobb 
County Magistrate Court Thursday. There are also questions surrounding her reactions to her son's death

Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month

Police
 had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched 
children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling 
officers it was her ‘worst fear.’

At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him.

‘Ross
 is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her 
husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’

Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions.

'Some
 of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the 
same question,' the deeply religious mother said.

Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head

'I should be crumpled 
into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing 
behind me, holding me up.'

The
 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her
 two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, 
even if she could.

'He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is,' she said.

Detective Stoddard also told the court 
that several injuries were found on the boy's body, including 
visible marks on his face, revealing that he had struggled to escape as temperatures soared.

Justin Ross Harris remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges. He has been denied bond.
