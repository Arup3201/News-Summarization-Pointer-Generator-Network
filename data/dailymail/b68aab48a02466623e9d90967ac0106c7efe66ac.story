A young woman who dismissed a brown mark on her arm as melted chocolate was later told it was a cancerous mole.

At first, Natasha Mash, 26, tried to wipe off the brown spot, believing it was the remnants of a chocolate bar she had been eating.

But concerned when it didn't go away, she visited a doctor, who reassured her it was nothing to worry about.

At first, Natasha Mash thought the mark (circled) was a bit of chocolate she had accidentally wiped on her arm. When she realised it was a mole, she saw her GP - but was told there was nothing to worry

Miss Mash, 26, was eventually diagnosed with melanoma - the most deadly form of skin cancer- after a different doctor noticed her mole during an appointment for a chest infection

It was only months later that another doctor happened to notice the mole - and she was eventually diagnosed with melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer.

Miss Mash, a youth worker who lives in Watford, then underwent three operations to completely remove the mole and save her life.

At age 22, Natasha noticed the 2cm spot in the mirror and headed straight to her doctor.

She was reassured that as she was so young, the chocolate-coloured mole was nothing to worry about.

But seven months later when she was at her GP surgery for a chest infection, her doctor noted the mole as a cause for concern and decided to keep an eye on it.

It was only when Miss Mash returned in February for a check-up that she found out the smudge she had at first thought was a blob of melted chocolate was actually skin cancer.

She underwent initial surgery a week after her diagnosis and then two further operations to make sure the cancer was completely removed.

The following ABCD rules show some changes that might indicate a 'melanoma', the deadliest form of skin cancer.

As skin cancers vary, it is important to tell a doctor about any changes to the skin, even if they are not mentioned here.  

Asymmetry - the two halves of the area may differ in shape

Border - the edges of the area may be irregular or blurred, and sometimes show notches

Colour - this may be uneven. Different shades of black, brown and pink may be seen

Diameter - most melanomas are at least 6mm in diameter. Report any change in size, shape or diameter to your doctor

Expert - if in doubt, check it out

If your GP is concerned about your skin, make sure you see a consultant dermatologist, the most expert person to diagnose a skin cancer.

Even now she has six-monthly check-ups and diligently checks all of her moles once a week to make sure there have been no changes.

Natasha was supported by the Teenage Cancer Trust who put her in touch with other young people who have also had the same type of cancer.

But she is determined not to wallow, wants to share her experience to help make other young people aware of the risks.

Miss Mash said: 'I mistook my mole for chocolate and so quickly realised that it was something much more serious.

'Never did I think something so small or seemingly insignificant could have such a big effect.

'One day I saw this big mark on my arm. I thought it was chocolate and tried to wipe it off.

'Then I realised that it was a mole I had always had that had changed dramatically.

'It was April, so I'd been wearing long-sleeved tops practically all of the time through the winter and not noticed it.

'I went to the doctor who shrugged it off and said it was nothing to worry about.

'You're so young that you think these kind of things don't happen to you.'

The following November, she visited the GP with a chest infection and another doctor noticed the mole.

She said: 'When I took my jumper off for the doctor to listen to my chest she noticed and said she wanted to keep an eye on it.

'I went back in February for some tests and a week later I had a phone call saying that the doctor wanted to have a chat.

Miss Mash said talking to other young cancer sufferers through the Teenage Cancer Trust made her feel less alone

'I didn't even think that it was anything to worry about until the doctor explained that it was melanoma and they needed to take action as quickly as possible.'

Miss Mash then underwent three operations to have the cancer removed.

She said: 'I had a big lump taken out of my arm at the beginning of March but I was really lucky that it was caught so early.

'At first they checked me every three months and now it's every six months

'I am really careful in the sun now and prefer to go on holidays where it won't be too hot.'

Talking to other young people suffering cancer made her feel less alone. 

She said: 'I spoke to a contact from the Teenage Cancer Trust at the hospital and she put me in touch with other young people who had a similar experience.

'I was able to talk about everything I was going through on the online forums which made a huge difference in helping me overcome the cancer.

'I thought I was the only person going through it but being able to speak to other people in the same position made me feel so much more normal!'
