Frisbee catching has been banned from a country dog show today on the grounds of health and safety amid fears the pets could injure themselves when taking part.

It is one of three events to be either dropped or altered at Scruffs Dog Show in Keswick, Cumbria, after organisers cited health and safety concerns.

Show organisers took the ‘bizarre’ decision to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the competing dogs could injure themselves.

The Kennel Club, which has named the town the UK’s most dog-friendly on two occasions, supported the decision.

Tony Lywood, one of the show’s organisers, said a third category – 'best biggest catcher' – had also been toned down for safety reasons. Instead of jumping to catch the biscuit, dogs will instead be sitting down when taking part.

Mr Lywood said the decision was made after fellow organisers raised concerns about the competing dogs’ wellbeing.

He said: ‘In shows elsewhere there have been occasions where dogs have jumped high and twisted their back, and there was one where the dog had to be put down.

‘The committee made the decision reluctantly, we were advised it was a better thing to do even though it sounds counterintuitive and bizarre.

‘I think we probably made the right decision, we just want to avoid any dogs getting hurt.

‘Health and safety has finally hit dogs.’

Organisers decided to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the dogs could get hurt. More than 500 people are set to attend the show in Keswick, Cumbria (above)

The Kennel Club endorsed the show's decision.

A spokesman said: ‘The Kennel Club encourages fun sports and activities for dogs in order to keep them fit and healthy.

‘But it has concerns about the game of frisbee, particularly in its more extreme forms.

‘While it can be safe in controlled conditions, if it is thrown at great heights or awkward angles, leading the dog to jump and twist, it can cause strain and injury on landing so care should always be taken.’

More than 500 people are expected to descend on Fitz Park in Keswick today for the dog show, which will see 28 dogs taking part in 24 different categories.

Other categories will see prizes awarded to the dog with the most appealing eyebrows, the waggiest tail, the longest tongue and the one which most looks like its owner.
