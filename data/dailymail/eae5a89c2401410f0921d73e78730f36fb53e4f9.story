England’s preparations for the Six Nations took a turn for the worse as Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan was carried off on a stretcher before his side won with a stunning last-minute penalty from James Hook.

The 25-year-old received several minutes of on-field treatment at Kingsholm after injuring his left ankle in a second-half collision that involved his international rival — Billy Vunipola of Saracens.

It was a game billed as a heavyweight battle for England’s No 8 jersey, but the contest could now end up being settled by default if Morgan fails to recover in time for his country’s opening fixture against Wales on February 6. Morgan was man of the series in the autumn Tests and the onus was on his opponent to lay down a marker.

Vunipola sucked in defenders early on from a standing start in midfield. The 22-year-old is one of the most effective players at making gains inside heavy traffic and helped to provide a stable platform from which his side could attack.

With Owen Farrell pulling out shortly before kick-off, it was left for Alex Goode to fill in at fly-half. The England hopeful had a tight calf but club officials were confident he will return to full fitness by next week. 

Goode took over the kicking duties and pinned the Cherry and Whites into the corner in the seventh minute. Saracens asserted their dominance at the set-piece, particularly in the line-out, and were awarded a penalty try after the hosts dragged down a driving maul.

Hook kicked two penalties to narrow the deficit to one-point inside the opening quarter, but should have been ahead after Billy Twelvetrees failed to pass to Jonny May and finish a simple two-on-one chance. The home side’s poor finishing was then punished as they leaked two more penalties to the boot of Goode.

The game within the game, Morgan versus Vunipola, did not quite live up to the billing in the first half, with Gloucester scrum-half Dan Robson being the stand-out performer. 

The 22-year-old signed for Wasps on Wednesday and showed a glimpse of his skill with a sublime score after 35 minutes. With a seemingly impossible amount of space to work with, the half back wriggled clear and chipped over the last man before touching down his score.

Hook missed the conversion but his side were given another shot to take the lead after David Strettle was penalised for a deliberate knock-on. The wing was shown a yellow card, but once again Hook’s kick fell short.

Strettle was joined in the sin-bin by Gloucester lock Tom Savage after the break and Saracens used their extra weight in the forwards when Billy Vunipola crashed over from a driving line-out.

Then came the moment of concern, as Morgan was replaced by Gareth Evans in the 49th minute. The home side rallied and another Hook penalty sparked a comeback. 

Callum Braley finished a pitch-length score after good work from May and Evans. George Kruis and May were then sent to the sin bin before Mako Vunipola crashed over to score. But Hook had the last laugh when he kicked a penalty from just inside his own half.
