Disgraced NFL star Aaron Hernandez was a heavy user of the drug angel dust - PCP - and was so paranoid he carried a gun with him at all times before his arrest in June, a new report claims.

The former New England Patriots player also surrounded himself with 'gangsters' and came to prefer those friends to his family or his teammates, whom he became increasingly detached from in the months before he was dragged from his home in handcuffs, Rolling Stone magazine reports.

The Rolling Stone story, published on Wednesday, traces Hernandez's path from star tight end to murder suspect. He is charged with shooting dead semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd in June at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

The magazine also accuses Hernandez's coach at the University of Florida, Urban Meyer, - and others at the football program - for effectively covering up an alleged attack on a bartender in Gainsville, as well as at least one positive drug test.

Another incident in which Hernandez allegedly fired into a car after a bar fight while he was playing for the Florida Gators may have been swept under the rug, as well.

A new report claims that Aaron Hernandez abused PCP, or angel dust, before he was arrested for murder

Prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows Aaron Hernandez carrying the .45-caliber pistol he used to kill Odin Lloyd. Rolling Stone claims he carried a gun with him everywhere

This picture of a young Hernandez dressed all in red - the color of the Bloods street gang - and flashing gang signs has been cited as evidence of his troubled past

The 23-year-old is also suspected in the 2012 murder of two immigrants from Cape Verde, who were shot and killed outside a nightclub in Boston. The case is being heard by a grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges.

The magazine claims that Hernandez killed Odin, who was a friend and was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance, after Odin talked to some of his cousins when he was at a bar with Hernandez. The cousins who didn't like Hernandez and told Odin that the NFL player was a 'punk.'

But Rolling Stone claims that the murder came as a result of Hernandez's paranoia from abusing angel dust. 

'Don’t matter what it’s about: Aaron’s out of his mind,' Rolling Stone quotes a family friend as saying.

'He’s been twisted on dust now for more than a year, which is when all of this crazy shit started.'

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the charges and hired top criminal defense attorneys to fight the case in court.

The magazine also claims that Hernandez carried a rifle in his gym bag wherever he went as a result of his paranoid.

Odin Lloyd, 27, was found murdered near Hernandez's home in June

His lawyer, Michael Fee, did not return a call from MailOnline seeking comment on the Rolling Stone allegations.

The magazine accuses Hernandez of being involved in a 'thug life' that was apparent even to New England head coach Bill Belichick.

When he was arrested he was only 'one step' from being cut from the team over the issues, it was claimed.

New England dropped Hernandez the day prosecutors announced they were filing murder charges against him and are attempting to claw back much of the money they owe him from a four-year, $40million contact he signed last year.

Hernandez's legal and disciplinary 
trouble didn't begin in the NFL. While playing for the Florida Gators in
college, he was arrested for punching a bartender in the head.

He was also suspended after he tested positive for marijuana.

Rolling
Stone claims that his drug violations may have been even more 
pronounced and that he failed drug tests than the one that was released publicly.

The magazine alleges that Florida coach Meyer and others in the football program worked to keep at least one other positive drug test - and the bartender attack - under wraps and out of the news media.

Meyer has not responded to the allegations.

The
magazine also reports that Hernandez's problems began with a troubled 
home life - claiming that both his mother and father had criminal 
records.

The story alleges that his mother Terri had a relationship with an alleged drug dealer with a history of violence.

When his father died, Terri moved her boyfriend into the house to live with Hernandez and his brother.
