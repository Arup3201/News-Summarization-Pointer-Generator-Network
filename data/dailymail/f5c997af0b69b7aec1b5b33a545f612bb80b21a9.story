The new breast-checking glove is said to be as effective as traditional breast cancer screening in detecting lumps

Women are being warned not to rely on a £25 glove claimed to be as effective as a mammogram at detecting signs of breast cancer.

The manufacturers of the BE gLOVE say it makes detecting lumps much easier during self-examination because it increases finger sensitivity.

But breast cancer charities are telling women not to put their faith in the product, saying evidence of its effectiveness is limited.

The warning comes only weeks after an advertising watchdog criticised an £86 ‘breast torch’ that manufacturers said could act as an ‘early breast-screening device’.

The glove is being publicised in the UK after clinical tests in Italy showed it allowed women to detect the same number of lumps as a mammogram.

Its manufacturer, IC Pharma, says the ultra-thin polyurethane glove magnifies finger sensitivity 15 times, making it easier for women to feel hard areas in their breasts.

But Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast  Cancer Campaign, said: ‘Evidence that devices of this nature can improve detection of breast tumours is very limited, so we urge women not to use tools such as the BE gLOVE as a substitute for mammograms or for being breast-aware.

‘We encourage all women to check their breasts regularly, know what is normal for them and discuss any concerns with their GP.’

Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It is important that women are not misled when it comes to checking their breasts. We do not advocate the use of these gloves and we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these. The best way for women to be breast- aware is to know their own breasts.’

The BE gLOVE is said to work by reducing friction on the skin, stopping lumps being pushed away by the fingers.

A clinical study by Professor  Stafano Varardi, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the University of Rome, compared women doing self-examinations with their bare hands with those using the glove.

The company behind the glove says it could help the millions of UK women who have no idea how to perform breast self-examination

Those given the glove detected the 
same number of lumps as were identified by mammography, according to IC 
Pharma. Women using their bare hands found only 50 per cent of the lumps
revealed by breast screening.

Official guidelines advise women to 
carry out breast self-examinations each month, but a survey by IC Pharma
showed most check themselves only two to three times a year, and 55 per
cent did not know the right way to look for lumps.

Company spokesman Karen Winterhalter said: ‘At the age when women should include breast self-examinations as an essential part of their routine in taking care of their health, it is staggering to see that 55 per cent do not know what they are doing.

‘Whilst we know that nine out of ten lumps found in the breast are not cancerous, it is extremely important for women to check their breasts regularly, so it becomes part of their routine.’

Last month the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that marketing of the Breastlight torch device was ‘misleading’ and ‘irresponsible’.

Cancer charities said they feared women were using the torches as a substitute for breast screening and getting ‘false reassurance’.

Everyone’s breasts are different, 
altering with age and at different times of the month.

Look for 
changes that are unusual for you, such as:

•    Lumps or thickening of breast tissue•    Continuous pain•    One breast becoming larger or lower•    Puckering or dimpling of the skin•    Nipples becoming inverted (turned in), changing shape or position•    Developing a rash, crusting or producing discharge from the nipples•    Swelling under the armpit or around the collarbone•    Continuous pain in the armpits
