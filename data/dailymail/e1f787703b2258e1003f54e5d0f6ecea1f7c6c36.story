The parents of a young girl left paralysed in a road crash have spoken of their disgust after the taxi driver responsible for the accident was fined just £250 and kept his licence.

Jessica Bootes, four, was left fighting for her life after Amir Azaz crashed into the back of the car she was travelling in with her parents, causing a six-vehicle pile-up.

Lisa Orrock, 31, and Chris Bootes, 36, were devastated when Azaz walked free from court - while they will spend the rest of their lives coming to terms with their daughter's disability.

Jessica's family had to endure an almost hour by hour trauma, waiting to find out if she would survive the injuries she suffered in the crash in Jarrow, South Tyneside

Jessica has been left paralysed down her right side, blinded in one eye and fearful following the crash on March 4 in Jarrow, South Tyneside.

On Tuesday Azaz, 35, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.

He was given six penalty points and a fine at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court, a punishment Ms Orrock slammed as 'disgusting'.

Ms Orrock, an estate agent before she left her job to care for her daughter, said: 'Jessica will live with this for the rest of her life.

'No punishment would have been harsh enough for Azaz in my opinion, but this is ridiculous.

'We have not got justice from the courts.

'I believe Azaz will go on to injure again, and I would hate this to happen to anyone else.'

The family, of South Shields, South Tyneside, had been driving to McDonald's and to Asda to buy Jessica an outfit for World Book Day.

While stopped at traffic lights Azaz careered into them from the right, hitting them from behind.

Jessica, who had been strapped into a booster seat in the back of the car, severely banged her head.

Lisa Orrock and her partner Chris Bootes are launching a civil case to try and secure funds to help pay for the specialist rehabilitation their daughter Jessica needs

She suffered a seizure on the road-side before being rushed to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where she was placed in an induced coma for 11 days and given a blood transfusion.

She also underwent emergency surgery to repair a damaged skull.

Jessica is now in a wheelchair and is only able to get out of it with the use of a specially made leg splint. She also wears training shoes and a helmet.

She has no use of her right arm, her speech is limited to single words and has lost the sight in her right eye.

Jessica now needs specialist rehabilitation, therapy and equipment to help live her life and the family's lawyers are working on a civil case to secure funds.

Ms Orrock said: 'Jessica was due to start school in September but now it's like she is back to square one having to learn how to talk and communicate all over again. She is being very brave but it's very tough to deal with.'

She
 said the family has 'suffered deeply' and were struggling to come to 
terms with the serious injuries their 'beautiful daughter' had suffered.

At hospital, Ms Orrock said the family had to ensure an 'almost hour by hour trauma of wondering whether Jessica would survive'.

Ms Orrock,
 whose partner Mr Bootes is a heavy goods driver, said Azaz hadn't shown
 any remorse or compassion which 'would of helped us'.

He added: 'I just don't believe this sentence sends out the right message to help prevent accidents. A stronger sentence would show all drivers that they have to take more responsibility for their actions on the roads.'

The family's lawyer, John Davis, said he was working to secure funds so that the family could 'get the specialist support they need to help maximise Jessica's recovery'.

He added: 'Much is unknown at this stage as to how she will respond to treatment and rehabilitation but the family is determined to ensure that she has the best possible quality of life ahead of her.'
