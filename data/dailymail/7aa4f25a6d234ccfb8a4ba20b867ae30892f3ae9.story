Richard Nixon is remembered for many things – but very rarely for being a softy.

However a series of love letters penned to his future wife long before his rise to power and fall from grace, reveal that at one time he was just another man in love.

Decades before he became known to some as ‘Tricky Dick’, it was Nixon making up the nicknames – sweet ones to his future bride in gushy love notes that reveal a surprisingly soft and romantic side of the man taken down by Watergate.

‘Dearest heart’, he addresses her, while recalling their first meeting in flowery prose and daydreaming about their future together.

During their two-year courtship Nixon and his wife Patricia Ryan exchanged dozens of letters, six of which will be unveiled Friday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, California, as part of an exhibit celebrating the 100th birthday of the woman Nixon playfully called his ‘Irish gypsy.’

‘Every day and every night I want to see you and be with you. Yet I have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy,’ Nixon writes in one undated letter. ‘Let's go for a long ride Sunday; let's go to the mountains weekends; let's read books in front of fires; most of all, let's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours.’

Eighteen years after his death, the correspondence offers a tiny window into a fiercely private side of Nixon that almost no one ever saw.

‘These letters are fabulous,’ said supervisory museum curator Olivia Anastasiadis. ‘It's a totally different person from the Watergate tapes that people know. President Nixon started out as an idealistic young man ready to conquer the world and with Pat Ryan he knew he could do it. There's a lot of hope, there's a lot of tenderness and it's very poetic.

Richard Nixon was secretly seeing a psychiatrist during the height of his political career, a new book has claimed.

The former US president began seeing Dr Arnold Hutschnecker in 1952 with a string of complaints he thought were all in his mind, like back and neck pain and insomnia.

‘The Gumshoe and the Shrink’ claims that Nixon continued seeing the doctor for at least a decade including during the fateful 1960 election which he lost to John F Kennedy.

Should the disclosures have been made public at the time, it is questionable whether voters would have allowed such an unstable man to become president.

Author David Robb also reveals that in a foreshadowing of Watergate Nixon once hired a private eye to look into Kennedy’s health.

According to the book, in 1960 Nixon’s team got into offices belonging to two doctors treating Kennedy looking for dirt that he was actually secretly ill.

When Kennedy found this out his father bizarrely asked his friend Frank Sinatra to find the best investigator around so they could do their own digging.

‘He loved her, he was absolutely enthralled by her and that's all he thought about.’

The letters stand in stark contrast to the grim-faced leader forced to resign in 1974, disgraced.

Instead, Nixon comes across as an ardent and persistent suitor in the letters, which date from 1938 to just before the couple's marriage in June 1940.

The two met while auditioning for ‘The Dark Tower’ in the Southern California town of Whittier and dated for two years until Nixon proposed on the south Orange County cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He later delivered her engagement ring in a small basket overflowing with mayflowers.

The romantic touch and chivalry that Nixon brought to his seaside proposal comes through in the letters as well.

In two of the handwritten notes, 
Nixon — raised a Quaker — uses ‘thee’ instead of ‘you’ to refer to his 
future bride, a pronoun that signals a special closeness in the Quaker 
tradition. He also writes about himself in the third person, referring 
to himself as a ‘prosaic person’ whose heart was nonetheless ‘filled 
with that grand poetic music’ upon knowing her.

‘Somehow
on Tuesday there was something electric in the usually almost stifling 
air in Whittier. And now I know. An Irish gypsy who radiates all that is
happy and beautiful was there,’ he wrote in one letter. ‘She left 
behind her a note addressed to a struggling barrister who looks from a 
window and dreams. And in that note he found sunshine and flowers, and a
great spirit which only great ladies can inspire. Someday let me see 
you again? In September? Maybe?’

A
much more practical - and somewhat less impulsive — Pat Ryan replies in
one short note: ‘In case I don't see you before why don't you come 
early Wednesday - and I'll see if I can burn a hamburger for you.’

The
object of Nixon's affection was slower to come around, but eventually 
was just as smitten with Nixon as he was with her, said Ed Nixon, 
Nixon's youngest brother.

‘She was quite an independent young lady and she was very cautious about anyone she met and if they couldn't smile, she wouldn't want to do too much unless she could make them smile. That captured Dick's imagination,’ the younger Nixon said. ‘She was challenging. She challenged me and I think she challenged Dick.’

Nixon's presidency began to unravel in 1972 when burglars who were later tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Nixon denied knowing about plans for the break-in beforehand, but an 18 1/2 minute gap in a recording of a post-Watergate White House meeting led many to suspect a cover-up.

Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974 and retreated to his native California. The following month he was granted a pardon by President Gerald Ford.

Pat Nixon never doubted her husband and stood by him until she died in 1993, a day after their 53rd wedding anniversary, said Robert Bostock, a consultant to the Richard Nixon Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the exhibit, and a former aide to Nixon after he left the White House.

Her loyalty and spirit was a 
testament to their love and part of what bound them together from the 
earliest days of their courtship in Whittier, when he was a young 
attorney and she a high school stenography teacher fresh out of college.

‘She
was with him the whole way; she never lost faith in him. Her feeling 
was that it was the country's loss when he had to resign, that he had 
accomplished so much good and had so much more good to accomplish,’

Mr
Bostock said. ‘Her favourite saying was, 'Onward and upward.' She spent
no time looking back. She was always looking forward.’
