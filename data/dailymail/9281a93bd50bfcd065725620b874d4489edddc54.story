A man has admitted faking his own death after being caught out when he got a speeding ticket four days later.

Raymond Roth, 47, had been reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach, New York, while swimming in July last year.

Officers
combed the water near the beach during a massive rescue effort but, 
days later and 730 miles away from home, Roth was stopped by police for 
speeding in South Carolina.

Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy

Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced yesterday he has now admitted a conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation.

He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death.

State police arrested both men in last August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, 'There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here' from the father.

But Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

'We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,' Davis told CNN on Thursday. 'He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.'

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.'He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,' he said.

Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression

Charges: Roth was arraigned on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident

'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced

Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina.

When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue.

But he failed to show up to a scheduled 
meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been 
admitted to hospital with depression.

Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island

Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death

Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina

Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges.

Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Davis has denied.

He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public.

Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she has received numerous phone calls from him despite court order of protection

Up for sale: Roth had put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death and was allegedly calling about the sale

'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Mr Roth allegedly said.

Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson.

In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance.

'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’

Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City.

Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.
