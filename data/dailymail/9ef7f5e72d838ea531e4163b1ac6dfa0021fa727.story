Actor Johnny Depp has allegedly been subpoenaed by a lawyer seeking to prove his client, a woman accused of fatally hitting a pedestrian with a limousine, is insane.

TMZ reported the star was served the papers on Thursday at the Los Angeles premiere of his new movie Transcendence.

The client, Nancy Lekon, is accused of mowing down and dragging a pedestrian for nearly a mile under a battered limousine through downtown Los Angeles in 2009.

Lekon will stand trial later this month charged with murder, after pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

At the time of her arrest, Lekon allegedly told police she was in the area because she was meeting Depp, her 'boyfriend'.

Her lawyer has now called on Depp to disavow Lekon's claims in court, in a bid to prove she is delusional.

Summoned to court: Actor Johnny Depp was allegedly subpoenaed on Thursday at the LA premiere of his new movie 'Transcendence'

Fun times: Johnny Depp was swarmed by adoring fans at the LA premiere of his new flick 'Transcendence', where he was allegedly summoned to court over a bizarre 2009 case

Depp, 50, has not commented on the reports.

NBC News reported the disturbing incident unfolded in December 2009, when Lekon, then 43, and 25-year-old Sonia Taunauu began arguing about narcotics in an industrial area near Skid Row known for drug dealing.

Lekon, who was driving a battered black 
1989 Cadillac limousine, left the area but then returned and allegedly mowed down Taunauu.

The victim was known around Skid Row as 'China'.

Victim: Sonia Taunauu, 25 (pictured left and right) died after being hit by a limousine and dragged for nearly a mile in downtown Los Angeles in 2009

Police said Lekon then dragged Taunauu under the limo for nearly a mile through Skid Row streets, at one point driving past a police station.

Pursuing officers tried to pull Taunauu out from under the vehicle, but she died at the scene.

Lekon collapsed on the road and was taken to a hospital before being booked for investigation of vehicular homicide.

She faces court at the end of this month.

Meanwhile, Depp has been in the spotlight this week over his relationship with fiance Amber Heard.

While the private Pirates of the Caribbean star denied rumors his 27-year-old sweetheart was pregnant, he gushed about his feelings for Heard in a recent interview with John Hiscock at The Mirror.

The father-of-two explained he 'loves kids' and would happily have a family of 100 with his new flame.

'As far as having more kids, it’s easy for me – and Amber should have the opportunity to have kids if she wants. Let’s face it, practising for it is fun and it’s all wonderful,' he said.

The couple met in 2010 during filming for The Rum Diary, but only confirmed their relationship last year.

Depp has been busy promoting his new film Transcendence, which opens April 18.
