Famed Raiders tight end turned television sports broadcaster Todd Christensen died at 57 in a Utah hospital on Wednesday after suffering complications during a liver transplant.

The two-time Super Bowl champ's death was announced this morning by Christensen's alma mater, the school that would launch his impressive football career, Brigham Young University.

Liver disease was among a number of illnesses Christensen reportedly battled prior to his death.

Christensen's son, Toby Christensen, said his father died Wednesday morning at Intermountain Medical Center near his home in Alpine, Utah.

'I've been receiving hundreds of texts, Facebook postings and emails â€” from everybody with a story about my dad,' Toby Christensen said.

Christensen was a devout Mormon who didn't drink, and his family believes his liver problems started 25 years ago after a "botched" gall bladder operation, his son told The Associated Press.

Chosen in the second round of the 1978 NFL draft, Christensen was first a Dallas Cowboy.

He began the 1979 season with the New York Giants but midway through the season he'd join the team that made him a star.

The Oregon raised Pennsylvania native helped lead the Raiders to Super Bowl victory twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984.

Christensen, at 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, never fit the Raiders' untamed mold. He was a thoughtful son of a professor, and even read his own poetry at a Super Bowl press conference. He later self-published three books of poetry.

In 1983, he set a tight end single season record when he caught 92 receptions. Three years later, he broke his own record by catching 95.

'Our condolences, thoughts, and prayers go out to the family of Todd Christensen. Great player, great guy,' tweeted BYU Football.

As a college baller, Christensen led the BYU Cougars in receiving three times between 1974 and 1977, ending his career at the school with 152 receptions.

'He had great skill,' BYU football Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards told the Daily Herald of Provo, Utah. 'He ran the ball well and he caught the ball extremely well. He had excellent ability in all areas and those are the things that stand out.'

In addition to his Super Bowl rings, Christensen played in the Pro Bowl for five of his 11 NFL seasons.

After his departure from pro football in 1988, Christensen's resume took some unexpected turns.

He had a brief flirtation with Major League Baseball when he hit a home run during a workout with the Oakland A's in 1990.

He even briefly appeared as a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television series.

Christensen appeared in other television projects like Married with Children and acted as a sports analyst for both ESPN and NBC.
