Cost: Disposing junk mail is costing English councils more than £50m per year

Taxpayers' are forking out more than £50 million a year - just to get rid of junk mail that is dumped on their doorsteps.

Last year the county of Cornwall alone paid £700,000 to send 4,000 tonnes of unwanted leaflets, pamphlets, menus and glossy adverts to landfill - enough to fill 500 dustcarts.

If it was recycled it would still cost a staggering £500,000 to process.

The claim comes as, tonight, the BBC's Panorama reveals that Royal Mail 'financially relies' on the distribution of junk mail - which is now said to be vital to the service's future.

Richard Kemp, Local Government Association vice chairman, said: 'If you extrapolate [the Cornwall figure] across England it's more than £50 million a year.

'We've got to cut down the stuff going into the waste streams, there's a lot of unwanted packaging.

'If people stop producing this stuff then we could make significant savings to their council tax, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.'

Tonight's Panorama will look at the role Royal Mail plays in getting junk and scam mail, of which it delivered 1.7 billion pieces last year, to residents' front doors.

It focuses on its links to Spring Global Mail, which handles vast amount of mail for legitimate international business, but is also alleged to be used by scam mail fraudsters.

Royal Mail owns 33 per cent of the firm, in partnership with the Dutch postal service Post NL, that sends large amount of scam mail into Britain.

And once that mail, which bears the official Royal Mail postmark and is not evidently from abroad, has entered the UK postal system the service has a legal obligation to deliver it.

Fraud investigators said the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, giving credence to the scammers' claims.

Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, said: 'We're trying to make Spring Global and Royal Mail more aware of the human tragedy that this type of fraudulent mail impacts on victims.

'I think they need to understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people.'

Marilyn Baldwin, whose late mother Jessica Looke was scammed out of £50,000, said the official stamp of approval 'proved the scams were real' to her, and that it was now up to the Royal Mail to protect the vulnerable.

She said: 'My mother used to say, it isn't a scam, it's genuine. This is the Queen's mail.

'Royal Mail are delivering, in effect, coach loads of criminals to the houses of elderly and vulnerable people. They are the link between the victim and the scammer.'

A spokesman for Royal Mail said it was working closely with police to stop scam mail from entering the system.

He said: 'We very much understand the upset and disquiet that scam mail can cause households across the country, including vulnerable people.

'We do not want our postmen or women handling or delivering mail that causes harm. We have made significant progress in our efforts to root out scam mail as we intensify our drive against it.'

Spring Global said it too was working closely with police and other agencies to prevent scam mail slipping through, and that since January it had removed six million items out of the system.

Of the 'local look' postmarks, it said in a statement: 'Local look is a recognised international marketing activity to prepare mail with a foreign postal indicia.

'This happens across the world and not just in the UK. The vast majority of companies using such a service are legitimate businesses that are looking to reduce costs and improve response rates.'

But Richard Hooper, who authored a report for the government on Royal Mail's future, said legitimate junk mail was central to the financial viability of Royal Mail.

He found that income from legitimate advertising mail accounted for nearly a quarter of Royal Mail's letters business - £1.3bn out of a total of £5.4bn.

He added: 'The supreme irony is that without advertising mail, you would not have a universal postal service.'

The Direct Marketing Association said sales due to junk mail totted up to £16bn a year and that half of the UK population had bought goods as a result of a piece of direct mail last year.

And Alex Walsh, its head of postal and environmental affairs, said: 'I do think we do need to make a differentiation between advertising mail and junk mail.

'For us it's very simple, junk mail is irrelevant and poorly targeted. That is waste and unnecessary. However, legitimate advertising mail is a different matter. It's whether it's relevant to those people.

'We have a very strict code of practice in terms of targeting and supression.

'And in fact the industry has made huge steps in the use of that. Inevitably there is some instances where that is not going to be accurate.

'But we are on the verge of signing a voluntary agreement with Government that will give us some very hard measurable targets to achieve our targets.'
