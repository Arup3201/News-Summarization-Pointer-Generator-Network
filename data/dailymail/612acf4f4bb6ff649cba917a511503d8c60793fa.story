A police officer who faces getting fired for failing to return to work after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year has revealed his battle with post traumatic stress disorder.

Thomas Bean said he is unable to forget the horrifying scenes he witnessed as one of the first responding police officers on December 14, when a gunman shot dead 26, including 20 children.

Speaking to the Today show, he revealed he had an urge to self harm after the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut and that he often cried in his sleep - or struggled to sleep at all.

'I can't describe the overwhelming 
senses of emotions that I had,' he said. 'That night I drank a lot. 
The next day, I wanted to cut myself because I just felt so numb.'

Struggle: Thomas Bean, who was one of the first cops to respond to Sandy Hook Elementary School following the shooting there last year, is fighting for long-term disability benefits as he now suffers from PTSD

As well as unexplained outbursts of anger, he also suffered flashbacks - sometimes seeing the scenes of horror out of the corner of his eye as he carried on a conversation.

He spoke with a friend who was a PTSD specialist and sought treatment, and a doctor recommended that he should not return to work.

Bean is the only officer not to return to the department following the massacre, although at least 14 others missed work because of PTSD associated with the killings.

He said he is now hopeful that the town keeps its promise to protect its officers.

'They promised us – all of us, all the police officers – that if we do our job, and something happens, they’re going to take care of us,' he told the Today show. 'And they're not holding up their word and that's all we want them to do, for myself and for anybody else that this is going to happen to.'

In August, Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe sent Bean a letter telling him that termination with the department was 'warranted and will be my recommendation to the Newtown Police Commission'.

Kehoe asked Mr Bean to meet with him 'to discuss the issue of whether termination of your employment is necessary due to the medical disability and your options if that is true.

'They haven't given him many options. It's either quit and get nothing, retire and get nothing or we will fire you and you get nothing,' Newtown police union President Scott Ruszczyk told The Courant.

Union officials said they expect Bean to be dismissed because the town does not want to pick up the cost of paying half of his salary until he is eligible to retire - which is mandated by the union.

Bean has been receiving long-term disability benefits, but the town's insurance police will only cover two years of long-term disability.

'The town tried to pinch some pennies by buying the wrong type of insurance policy, ' said Eric Brown, attorney for the Newtown Police Union, reported NBC.

'Tom acknowledges, based on his own reports, that he's probably not going to be able to come back to work. The question is what type of benefit is he entitled to?' Mr Brown said.

Bean said he thinks other police 
officers would like to file disability claims but have returned to work 
because they fear the repercussions.

'I
believe some of them are afraid of what’s going on, so now they can’t 
take care of themselves, because they’re too worried about the 
financial, which is a huge burden,' he said.

Last month the demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary School began under a cloak of secrecy and security to discourage ghoulish souvenir-hunters.

Officials hope it will be completely dismantled by the one-year anniversary of the attack.
