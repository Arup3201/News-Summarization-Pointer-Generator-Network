These are China's boy racers, gathering for an illegal The Fast and the Furious-style car race.

The drivers were caught in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province after police found out about the event on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter.

The illegal street races popular in Asia were the inspiration for 2001 car racing movie starring Vin Diesel, and in the latest race busted by police the cars involved included top of the range sports cars.

Police spokesman Bo Hsieh, 45, said: 'We found several Ferraris, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and BMW motor cars gathered on the road in Hangzhou.

'They were well organised and had hired security guards to simply block off the road to prevent anyone else coming on to it while they were racing.

'This in itself is completely illegal as well as speeding on a public road and all of those involved will be punished.'

Police confirmed that by blocking the road none of the racers had been able to escape in the cars although several had escaped on foot.

Bo Hsieh said: 'There were a lot of people there and although some quickly made off we were able to capture most of them.'

He said that they had been tipped off by monitoring traffic on Weibo and had set up an operation to arrest those involved.

He added: 'The organiser we believe is a millionaire who made his money with a car dealership.

'He also has a firm that deals in modifying high-performance cars and had worked on adapting a lot of the cars that were taking part in the race.'

Police confirmed that they had applied to confiscate the seized cars many of which they alleged had undergone illegal adaptations that meant they were not fit to be driven on Chinese roads.
