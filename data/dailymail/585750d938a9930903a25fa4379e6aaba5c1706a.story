New York has knocked London from its position as the world's leading global financial center after seven years, according to the Global Financial Centres Index.

The rankings, compiled by London-based consultancy Z/Yen, gave London 784 points versus 786 awarded to New York.

The report noted that New York's ascendance is due in large part to London's fall in the biannual rankings.

Clash of the Titans: New York City has overtaken London as the top world financial center, according to the biannual Global Financial Centres Index, for the first time in seven years

The GFCI asks over 3,000 financial professionals twice a year to give their take on the world's commerce centers.

On a 1,000 point scale, they anointed the following cities with the precious top 10 spots.

'This seems to be based on a number of factors including ... uncertainty over Europe, the perception that London might be becoming less welcoming to foreigners and perceived levels of market manipulation,' wrote the report's author Mark Yeandle on Z/Yen's website.

'London sees the largest fall in the top 50 centres,' said Yeandle.

Yeandle also pointed to London's regulatory environment as a reason for its slip.

'Because London is less of a swashbuckling place,' he told the Financial Times, 'thereâ€™s less opportunity to make money.'

According to the report, New York's two-point lead is 'statistically insignificant' on the survey's 1,000 point scale.

And, besides, the lead could be a shaky one for both finance capitals as Asian centers continue to flourish.

Hong Kong and Singapore took third and fourth spots respectively, the same as a year ago, the survey showed.

But the gap between the 'Big Four' and the chasing pack, led by Zurich, Tokyo and Seoul, was narrowing, it said.

Middle East centres, such as Qatar, 
Dubai and Riyadh, which took places 26, 29 and 31 respectively, 
continued to rise in the index, while 23 of the 27 European centres 
declined in rank.

TheCityUK,
 a lobby group for British financial and professional services, said 
London slipping from the top spot should be a wake-up call for Europe's 
policymakers.

'London 
is Europe's financial center and is hugely important to the continent's 
ability to finance growth and create jobs by attracting global 
investors,' said Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK.

The Global Financial Centres Index is compiled from assessments completed by 3,246 financial services professionals, Z/Yen said.

Hong Kong snagged the number three spot, as it did in the previous survey. The Asian financial centers as a whole have been quickly gaining on Western cities

Singapore fell just behind Hong Kong and also has benefited from fears over Europe and a generally burgeoning Asian economic climate
