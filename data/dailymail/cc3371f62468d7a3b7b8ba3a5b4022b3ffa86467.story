The infamous row between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi was sparked by a disagreement on whether her daughter should go to university, it has been claimed.

The celebrity couple split after remarkable pictures, taken outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, in June appeared to show Mr Saatchi 'throttling' Miss Lawson.

Within weeks of the pictures being published around the world, they had divorced after 10 years of marriage.

Infamous moment: Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi were allegedly rowing about whether her daughter Mimi should go to university in the lead up to this incident outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair in June last year

But it has remained a bone of contention as to what caused the heated argument which resulted in Mr Saatchi appearing to grab the 53-year-old TV chef's throat as she broke down into tears.

It has now been claimed the couple had been having a disagreement on whether Miss Lawson's daughter Mimi should go to University.

According to Vanity Fair, Mr Saatchi told a close friend that he told Miss Lawson that Mimi should continue her internship at The Economist rather than leave to go to university.

However, the credibility of the claim in Vanity Fair is contradicted by Miss Lawson's evidence on oath in court that the argument was in fact about her desire to become a grandmother.

During the lunch date on June 9, he is said to have pressed the point that Mimi could continue to impress her bosses at the publication and gain an advantage on those leaving university with little or no experience in the profession.

Divorce: Nigella Lawson divorced her husband Charles Saatchi after she was photographed apparently being throttled by the millionaire art editor

First interview: Nigella Lawson has appeared on 
GMA last week and admitted she'd been 'eating a lot of chocolate' to cope with the
 trials of the past year including drug allegations and her divorce

Admission: Nigella told the TV morning show in New York on Thursday that she was 'mortified' by the playing out of her private life in court

As the discussion became more and more heated, Miss Lawson excused herself from the table outside and visited the toilets in the restaurant.

Mr Saatchi is said to have told the unnamed source he became increasingly frustrated when Miss Lawson returned to the table and was 'unable to focus'.

The source claimed Mr Saatchi only then took a hold of Miss Lawson's neck to 'get her attention'.

He is then said to have told Nigella: 'Listen to me. I feel very passionate about this. I think it's great they love her at The Economist.'

Miss Lawson is said to have refused to co-operate with the Vanity Fair article.

However, the credibility of the claim in Vanity Fair has to be doubted as Miss Lawson gave evidence on oath that the argument in fact was about her desire to become a grandmother.

She told the court: ‘Someone walked by with a very sweet baby in a stroller, and I said “I’m so looking forward to having grandchildren”.

‘And he grabbed me by the throat and said: “I’m the only person you should be concerned with – I’m the only person who should be giving you pleasure”.’

Photographs of the incident led directly to Mr Saatchi accepting a police caution for assault and the couple divorcing.

It has previously been claimed by 
Miss Lawson's former assistants during their trial for fraud that the 
argument had been about the TV chef using drugs.

But both Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi insisted the row was not about drugs.

Admission: Miss Lawson told the jury that she had snorted cocaine seven times in total - including once while married to Charles Saatchi

Departure: Nigella Lawson leaves court after admitting taking cocaine and smoking cannabis during her marriage to Charles Saatchi

Referring to the incident outside Scott's Restaurant in Mayfair, central London, Mr Saatchi told Isleworth Crown Court: 'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be clear?

'Was it about her drug use? No.'

During the court case, the TV cook admitted she had snorted cocaine and had even smoked cannabis in front of her children.

But she said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi.

During seven hours of testimony, Miss Lawson, 53, was asked: ‘Are you or have you ever been a user of cocaine?’ She replied: ‘I have never been a drug addict. I have never been a habitual user. But there were times in my life when I used cocaine.’

She was testifying against Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo who allegedly went on lavish spending sprees with Mr Saatchi's company credit cards. The sisters were cleared of the charges.
