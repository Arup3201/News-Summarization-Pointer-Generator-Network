World leaders will gather for crunch talks at Camp David today as Greece teeters on the edge of exiting the euro.

The Group of Eight industrialised nations meet at the U.S. presidential retreat near Washington DC for a two-day summit.

The focus will be on Greece as it stumbles toward an unprecedented eurozone exit that could rock the global economy.

It comes as EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht revealed for the first time today that the European Commission and the European Central Bank are working on an emergency scenario in case Greece does leave.

He said: 'A year and a half ago there may have been the danger of a domino effect.

'But today there are, both within the European Central Bank and the European Commission, services that are working on emergency scenarios in case Greece doesn't make it.'

A call was also made today by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for the introduction of a directly elected EU president to help strengthen the bloc's political union and overcome the debt crisis.

He said: 'We've got to create a political union now. We need strong European institutions.'

His comments follow a fresh round of market panic sparked by elections in the debt-ridden country that saw huge losses for the parties that back austerity measures.

A political crisis has followed leaving the two-year-old effort to prevent a Greek default on its 173billion euro ($220 billion) bailout on life support.

It is possible the June 17 election will result in a government that would refuse to implement the austerity measures that Greece's last remaining international creditors are insisting on.

Speculation is increasing that Greece may have to leave the eurozone and markets across the globe fear the crisis may be slipping beyond control.

In Spain, the main share index fell this morning more than 2 per cent before recovering, while shares in London fell by as much as 1 per cent.

Confidence in European banks was also undermined by ratings agency Moody's, which cut the credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks.

The country said today it will name independent auditors to probe bad loans and property holdings in the financial sector and determine how big a state bailout is needed. 

In Asia, stock markets registered heavy losses. Tokyo's Nikkei average fell 3 per cent, the biggest one day fall since last August.

Asian markets were also hit by losses in New York, where the Dow Jones closed more than 1 per cent lower.

'The crisis in Greece is a very serious and immediate problem,' said Uri Dadush, a former senior World Bank official. 'Bank deposits are leaving Greece today.'

But elections France and Germany have shattered a long-standing consensus that spending cuts are the answer to Greece - and Europe's - woes leaving the G8 divided as the end game approaches.

New French President Francois Hollande is sure to use his first G8 to press for pro-growth policies, and is likely to win the backing of most people around the table.

That puts the pro-austerity German Chancellor Angela Merkel firmly in the hot seat as pressure grows for a new direction.

'The medicine that they have been taking is not working' said Dadush.

'This will be an opportunity for the US, Italy and France, not to gang up, but to work together on Merkel to say 'look, you need a somewhat different approach.''

Merkel may even find herself arguing with her host, President Barack Obama.

Fearing the impact of European financial chaos on the United States as it approaches elections in November, Obama seems poised to wade into what has largely been a European debate.

At the summit, Obama will raise 'specific' actions Europe could take, as the US welcomes the 'debate in Europe about the imperative for jobs and growth,' according to National Security Adviser Tom Donilon.

Still, with Obama unwilling or unable to put more cash on the table, he may find himself with minimal leverage.

A compromise may be found in the creation of joint European bonds for specific infrastructure or investment projects in hard-up countries.

Supporters say the move would allow much needed stimulus at a relatively low cost and keep budget cuts in place, allowing the G8 to claim it is focusing on austerity and growth.

Others argue that will do little to reverse the drag that fiscal consolidation has put on the economies of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy.

G8 leaders will hold their main discussions on Europe's fiscal plight Saturday at Camp David's rustic collection of cabins in the wooded Catoctin Mountain in Maryland, outside Washington.

On Friday night, discussions around the dinner table at Obama's Laurel Lodge will focus on Iran's nuclear challenge ahead of talks between global powers and the Islamic Republic in Baghdad later this month.

The leaders are also expected to address Syria's crackdown on its anti-government uprising, fears North Korea will launch a new nuclear test and Myanmar, after Obama eased US investment restrictions Thursday on the country formerly known as Burma.

The G8 club of developed nations includes the U.S., Britain, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and Russia.
