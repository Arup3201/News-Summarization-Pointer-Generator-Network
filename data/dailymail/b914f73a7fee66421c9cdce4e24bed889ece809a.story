Love cheat: Katherine Poxon, 22, plotted with her lover Stephen Swallow, 44, to attack her husband Steven

A cheating wife who was charged with plotting with her secret lover to have her husband killed has rekindled the romance with her intended victim.

Katherine Poxon, 22, and Stephen Swallow, 44, both admitted planning to attack her husband Steven when they appeared in court today.

But Mr Poxon has forgiven his wife for her affair and they are going to work out their differences.

He was even sat in the public gallery at Leeds Crown Court, where she and Swallow were due to stand trial for conspiring to murder him, before they pleaded guilty to conspiring to cause him grevious bodily harm.

A previous court hearing was told that the young mother had allegedly asked her lover Swallow to kill her husband after he threatened to take custody of their child if she left the marriage.

The hearing was told that Poxon had allegedly sent her lover a text message to 'get the job done'.

Police arrested Poxon, who has never had a job, and after questioning she was charged with soliciting murder, conspiracy to murder and perverting the course of justice.

Two days earlier, on September 7, last year, Swallow’s niece Kirsty had contacted Poxon claiming she as aware she had asked her uncle to kill Mr Poxon.

Richard Clewes, defending Poxon, said his client had confessed to her husband about sending the texts on September 6 and they had decided to make a go of their marriage - she had then destroyed the sim card before the police arrested her.

Mr Clewes told Judge Geoffrey Marson QC: 'She told her husband about this on the Friday that she had sent the messages and they were in the process of sorting things out.'

Even as Poxon went through the court system, her forgiving husband was posting on Facebook alongside photos of him and Poxon kissing passionately pages stating ‘you are my one in a million’ and phrases ‘This is for my baby girl LV U 2 bits bbe xxxxxxx’.

Poxon wept in the dock today as she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of conspiring together with Swallow to cause grievous bodily harm between August 28 and September 9, last year. Swallow admitted the same offence.

Swallow, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, was remanded in custody and Poxon was granted bail for the preparation of reports prior to sentencing on March 21.

The court was told that the perverting the course of justice charges will lie on file while the remaining charges will be dealt with on the day of sentence.
