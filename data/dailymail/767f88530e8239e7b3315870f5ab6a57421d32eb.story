A photo of the Detroit Red Wings prospect who shook up a non-existent NHL season with his bizarre drunken driving arrest last month has been revealed in all of his Teletubby-clad glory.

Riley Sheahan, 20, of Ontario, Canada, who now plays with the Red Wings minor league affiliate Grand Rapids Griffins, was pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving back on October 29.

He later submitted to a breathalyzer test and blew a .30 - more than three times the legal limit - classifying him under Michigan's 'super drunk' law (.17 or higher).

And if there is anything more shocking than his blood-alcohol level, it was his choice of attire - a purple Teletubbies costume, that of Tinky Winky.

The details of Sheahan's arrest were reported on Tuesday by MLive.com.

Given the date of his arrest, it is likely that Sheahan was driving to or from a Halloween party, but that detail could not be verified.

If convicted, he faces up to 180 days in jail and may be booted back to Canada.

When he was pulled over by officers, he allegedly handed over the driver’s license of Brendan Smith, a teammate and fellow Red Wings prospect.

Police allege that Sheahan was using the 23-year-old Smith's ID so that he could drink alcohol.

The arresting officer wrote in the police report: 'Riley is only 20 and I asked him if he had Branden’s (sic) ID so he could get in the bars. He shook his head yes and stated "yea."'

MLive.com reported that Sheahan 
pleaded not guilty to the charges of DUI and providing false information
to a police officer on November 6.

His next court date is slated for 
December 13.

When asked about Sheahan's arrest, Red 
Wings general manager Ken Holland told the Detroit Free Press: 'I'm 
aware that Riley was charged with a DUI. We're handling it internally.

'He sat out a game. We've talked to him. We're aware of what's happened.'

Sheahan, a No. 1 draft pick who had been playing hockey with Notre Dame, was called up by the Red Wings for one game on April 7, 2011, but he collected only a few penalty minutes as the team fell to the Chicago Blackhawks.

The arrest comes at a grim time for the locked out National Hockey League, as labor negotiations remain stalled.

The NHL has canceled more than one-third of its regular season, including all games through December 14, the New Year's Day outdoor Winter Classic and the All-Star weekend scheduled for January 26-27 at Columbus, Ohio.
