Oscar De La Hoya, a living legend himself, believes our own Amir Khan will join him in the pantheon of ring superstars.

And he expects Khan to prove him right whenever his chance comes to fight Floyd Mayweather.

De La Hoya, now Khan’s Golden Boy promoter, has kicked off this son of Bolton’s big fight week in Las Vegas by saying: ‘Amir can become one of the all-time greats.

‘He is in the welterweight division, which is where you get the best of both worlds. Speed and power. And Amir has them both. 

'Sugar Ray Robinson is absolutely the best welterweight ever but Amir can be as spectacular as anyone in history.’

Khan has the opportunity to demonstrate as much on Saturday night when he tops the bill at the MGM Grand Garden for the first time.

He has starred at the Mandalay Bay before but says ‘the MGM is the biggest venue in world boxing.’

He will share that fabled ring with Devon Alexander. The pair should have collided a year ago for the world title the American still held at that time.

Now they contest what many here are talking of as a final eliminator for the enriching privilege of becoming the next fighter to threaten Mayweather’s unbeaten record.

De La Hoya is hopeful that a fight between Khan and Floyd Mayweather can be sorted in the future

Khan, who has twice lost world titles of his own, admits: ‘I can’t afford another mistake.’

De La Hoya does not expect him to slip up again.

‘The bigger the fight, the bigger the prize, the more Amir rises to the occasion. Alexander is a very talented, very durable boxer but Amir is in the perfect place to fulfil now.’

Money Mayweather is their target but Khan’s dream of finally clinching that long-promised bonanzat is threatened by a growing sense that Floyd Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will come to terms at last for the richest fight of all time, the one the world wants to see.

De La Hoya says; ‘Well, I’m a boxing fan first and foremost and like everyone else in the game I want to see that fight and I believe it should happen. 

'But it annoys me that Amir keeps being promised his turn for a major fight and it doesn’t happen.’

Mayweather is scheduled to take to the ring next in May and Pacquiao has thrown down a challenge which boxes his rival for the mythical title of best pound-for-pound fighter into a corner

De La Hoya says; ‘If Floyd doesn’t meet Manny then I believe his only other option is to fight Amir, who in addition to his own Khan army of fans from Britain is recognised in America as very exciting.’

There has also been talk of Khan taking on his former sparring partner Pacquiao and De La Hoya says: ‘While Amir’s speed would set huge problems for Mayweather, I think Pacquiao would be slightly the more difficult fight for him.

‘But I’m not saying he couldn’t win. Style-wise Amir is more trouble for Floyd but he is a major threat to any welterweight in the world, both those guys included.

‘I’m pushing for the Mayweather fight because Amir deserves it. And when does go in against Floyd or Manny, don’t be surprised if he wins.’

If Mayweather takes another route, again, one alternative for Khan is a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, who now brings a world title to the table and expects to return to the ring in Aprill after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday.

Khan has made it clear that will only happen if he dictates all the terms and conditions.

De La Hoya says: ‘Khan-Brook in front of 100,000 people at Wembley Stadium could be a fall-back position. But what I really want for Amir is the super-fight which brings his chance of glory.’

Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports on Saturday night
