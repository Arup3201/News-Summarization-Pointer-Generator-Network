Police Sgt. Gary Gross told the Ledger of Lakeland the woman 'wasn't paying attention.' 

She suffered a compound fracture to her right arm, and her right leg was injured.

She was taken to a hospital, but no additional information was available. 

Kristin Seay, spokesman for train operator CSX, told The Ledger: 'Accidents between trains and pedestrians or vehicles are all too common.

'About every three hours somewhere in the U.S, a person or a vehicle is struck by a train.

'We urge drivers and pedestrians to use extreme caution around railroad tracks for their personal safety.'

She said the train had two locomotives and was carrying consumer goods from Winter Haven to Jacksonville.
