Praised: Jade Goodwin, 21, and mother Julie, 50, have been praised by a judge after they apprehended a prolific burglar by tackling him to the ground and sitting on him

A mother and daughter were praised by a judge after they caught a prolific burglar by rugby tackling him to the ground and sitting on him until the police arrived.

Jade Goodwin, 21, and her mother Julie, 50, apprehended Wayne Wooldridge as he attempted to make off with cash and jewellery.

The pair chased Woolridge, 44, as he tried to flee their home in Walsall, West Midlands, after they returned to find him stood in the living room.

He was eventually stopped after Miss Goodwin tackled him to the ground.

The thief managed to wriggle free but she tackled him again before a passing motorist saw them struggling in the doorway of the property and helped stop him escaping.

Off-duty security guard Graham Harvey also witnessed the incident and sat on the thief with Mrs Goodwin while her daughter dialled 999.

Wooldridge, who has 50 previous convictions for burglary and attempted burglary, was jailed for three years and eight months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Wednesday after admitting burglary and assault.

He asked for 83 other offences to be taken into account.

The court heard Wooldrige, of Walsall, had only been out of prison for three weeks when he raided the Goodwin’s home.

Judge Robin Onions told him: 'You have a dreadful record and subjected Mrs Goodwin and her daughter to what must have been a terrifying experience.

'They both showed commendable bravery and deserve an official commendation for their actions.'

Jasvir Mann, defending, told the court: 'The address was empty when he broke in but any burglar risks the return of the occupant and he ran off as soon as she arrived.'

The stolen jewellery, which includes irreplaceable heirlooms from Mrs Goodwin’s later mother, has never been recovered, and police believe there was a second, undiscovered, offender.

Wooldridge has now refused to help the couple get their possessions back.

Speaking after the hearing Mrs Goodwin said: 'I thought I was a strong person but this incident has shaken me.

'It still makes me cry. I have lived happily in that house for 50 years and this was such an invasion of my privacy.

'I have always managed to see the good in people and have never experienced anything like this before but it has made me want to move from this house I loved and an area I have always been happy to live in.

'The person who did this has no consideration for anyone else.

Mrs Goodwin went on to say: 'His actions have broken me and I hope he rots in jail.

'I
have heart problems and have had angina attacks since this happened but
I have no regrets over my daughter and I having a go.

'They both showed commendable bravery and deserve an official commendation for their actions'

- Judge Robin Owens

'It would have felt so much worse if that so and so had got away with it.'

Miss Goodwin said: 'Mum shouted "get him" as he ran off and I just went for him.

'I was like a bull. I have watched my brothers play rugby in the past and so had a rough idea how you were supposed to tackle.

'He broke free but I ran after him and got him again.'
