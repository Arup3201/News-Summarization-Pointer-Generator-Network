Sam Rouen, who's known for winning The Biggest Loser after losing nearly half his body weight in 2008, has been selected as the new candidate for the annual NSW Firefighters Calendar

In 2008, Mr Rouen went from 154kg to 82kg on the third season of Channel Ten's reality weight-loss TV series

The fireman, of Campbelltown in Sydney's south-west, told Daily Mail Australia he is overwhelmed by the support.

'I just jumped on board not expecting anything,' he said.

'I don't want to get too ahead of myself but I'm pretty excited about it.' 

In season three of the reality weight-loss series, The Biggest Loser, Mr Rouen went from 154kg to 82kg.

Mr Rouen has shed 71kg, fulfilled his dream of becoming a firefighter and now has been voted as one of the favourite half-naked calendar models for 2016

The Campbelltown local, Sydney's south-west, says the calendar is for a good cause as it raises funds for The Children's Hospital at Westmead Burns Unit

After his huge achievement, he went on to accomplish his life-long passion of becoming a firefighter.

'It's something that I've always wanted to do as a kid but never thought it would be a viable option as I grew up,' Mr Rouen said.

Although he failed his first application, he was determined to succeed and finally did so by his third attempt - four years after winning the reality series.

Fans were clearly impressed by his potential candidacy on Facebook, which generated comments such as: 'Wow, what a hottie!!! U'd [sic] be mad NOT to put him in the calendar', 'whatever month he's on, I don't think I'll be changing my calender all year' and 'what a babe!'

Mr Rouen was sheepish at the idea that he may well become a pin up boy.

'I never really thought I'd be doing something like this considering I don't really like taking my shirt off - even at the beach,' he said.

'I'm really appreciative of all the comments and the support and I often have to pinch myself because these aren't things that are said to me a lot.' 

Successful candidates will be shooting the 2016 NSW calendar in March next year to raise money for The Children's Hospital at Westmead Burns Unit.

Since its inception in NSW nine years ago, they've raised more than $250,000 for the cause.
