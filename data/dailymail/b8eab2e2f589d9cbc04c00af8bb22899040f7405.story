A young mother died from cancer after hospital doctors told her to cure a lump on her breast with primrose oil ointment. 

Samina Chaudhry, 33, from Northampton, went back several times to say the primrose oil treatment was not working. 

Two years later, doctors sent the biopsy for analysis but the cancer was so far advanced it could not be treated.

A CT scan and MRI found multiple tumours on her brain.

Her devastated husband Mohammed is now bringing up their two sons Zeeshan, 13, and Usman, 11, on his own.

Samina first visited her GP in 2006 when she was just 27-years-old and she was referred to Northampton General Hospital. 

However, hospital doctors diagnosed a skin condition similar to eczema and advised her to treat it with primrose oil ointment.

However, despite going back several times it wasn't until November 2008 that a biopsy was sent to be examined. 

'When she was finally diagnosed, Samina aged in seconds. The blood just drained from her. It was devastating', Mohammed told The Sunday Mirror. 

'My poor wife didn’t stand a chance.'

Samina had a mastectomy as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Throughout her illness, she even carried on her job helping parents and young children at a Sure Start centre. 

However, in 2012 her condition deteriorated and Samina was admitted to a hospice.

The mother decided to die at home and so the family living room was turned into a makeshift ward.

Within a month, Samina had died.

Following legal action Northampton General Hospital agreed to pay the family damages yesterday.

The MailOnline is awaiting a comment from Northampton General Hospital.
