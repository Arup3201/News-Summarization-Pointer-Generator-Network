A pilot and his wife used quick-thinking and modern technology to safely land their plane at night after the electrical systems failed.

By using their iPads, they were able to navigate through nearly 80 miles in the dark before successfully bringing down the single-engine propeller plane onto a runway at Rapid City Regional Airport in South Dakota - without using landing gear.

The pair, whose names have not been released, were flying the Piper PA 24-250 Comanche from Wyoming to Wisconsin when their plane had a full electrical-system failure last Friday night.

The couple, whose names have not been released, were flying from Wyoming to Wisconsin last Friday night on their single-engine propeller plane. As a result of an electrical system breakdown, the pilot and his wife used their iPads to navigate to the airport

The electrical failure caused all of the on-board computers to shut down and made the pilot unable to extend landing gear onto the runway, according to KEVN Black Hills Fox. 

The only cockpit instruments he and his wife had available to them were airspeed and altitude indicators.

As they were also unable to alert traffic controllers that they were entering Rapid City airspace, they had to abruptly crash-land the plane onto the runway.

Tower employees reported seeing sparks beneath the bottom of the plane as it skidded to a stop, according to KDLT.

They were also unable to alert traffic controllers that they were entering Rapid City airspace, and without landing gear, the pilot landed the plane on its belly on a runway used for smaller planes

'He had to be a super good pilot,' said Department Battalion Chief Tim Daly.

A firefighter and Aircraft Rescue specialist Jerry Lueras made contact with the pilot and his wife following their landing. 

The couple was able to exit the plane without any injuries and were given a brief medical examination.

Officials have to investigate the impromptu landing, and said it will likely take time before the plane is flown again.

'We're glad for the support of the Rapid City Fire Department, as well as the support of our operations and maintenance crews at the airport,' said Toni Broom, Deputy Airport Director for Finance and Administration. 

'This was a great example of our teamwork, and we're happy that there were no injuries from these incidents.'
