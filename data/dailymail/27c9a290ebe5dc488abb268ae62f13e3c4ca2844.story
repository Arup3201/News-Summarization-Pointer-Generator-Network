U.S. health authorities are currently investigating a fourth possible outbreak of norovirus aboard a cruise ship this year.

Officials with the Centers for Disease Control boarded the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

During the course of the week-long Caribbean cruise, 114 passengers and 10 crew members got sick - suffering mainly from vomiting and diarrhea.There were a total of 1,273 passengers on board and 575 crew members.

A CDC environmental health officer and epidemiologist will conduct an assessment of the ship and determine the outbreak.

They will also be testing stool samples from the sick passengers and crew members.

While the cause of the outbreak has not yet been discerned, if it turns out to be norovirus it would be the fourth such instance aboard a cruise ship this year.

Last month, three cruise ships had outbreaks - including a particularly nasty case aboard the Explorer of the Seas.

Over 600 passengers aboard the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line got sick with norovirus, in addition to 55 crew members.

Another outbreak aboard a Princess Cruise line caused the ship to cut short it's seven-day trip.

What is norovirus? Also known as the Winter Vomiting Bug in the UK, norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed.

And this isn't the first time the ms Veendam had an outbreak of illnesses.

Since the CDC has been posting cruise-ship outbreak reports online, the ship has had seven cases of mass illness.

Just last spring, a ms Veendam cruise was infected with E. coli. And there were two cases of norovirus in the span of three months of 2005.

It seems the outbreak could have been prevented as well.

In September the ship failed a CDC sanitation inspection, after brown liquid was found dripping on clean dishes and a fly in the buffet.

'While unacceptable for Holland America Line, the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration,' Holland America's Sally Andrews said last year.

The CDC grades cruise ships on a 100-point scale, and anything less than an 85 is considered failing. The ms Veendam got a 77.Â
