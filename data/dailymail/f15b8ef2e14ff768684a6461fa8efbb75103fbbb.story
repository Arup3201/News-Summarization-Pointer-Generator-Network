From airport delays to holiday traffic jams on the way to the seaside, sometimes it can be tempting to stay at home instead of going globetrotting.

But now you can fly above some of the world’s most iconic landmarks and natural wonders thanks to a website that makes it easy to find videos filmed by drones.

A Swiss drone enthusiast has collected drone footage scattered across the web, and organised it on a map of the world, allowing you to take a quick scenic flight from the comfort of your sofa.

Jan Hiersemenzel told CNN he made website Travel By 
Drone to create a library of drone footage from around the world.

‘It’s difficult to find good drone footage and there are great videos scattered everywhere,’ he said.

Now,
 people at home can choose a location on a map of the world and zoom in 
to see drone videos pinpointed on certain locations.

Using the map, people can choose an aerial video including the Las Vegas strip, a flight over Antarctica (pictured) and skirting around the elaborate towers of Angkor Wat in Cambodia

Most people associate drones with military attacks, but they are used for a host of other reasons.

Farmers
 are starting to use drones to map their farms as well as to survey 
crops and livestock. They can spot weeds and take pictures that show how
 much fertilizer needs to be applied.

Amazon.com has demonstrated the drones could be used to deliver parcels in remote areas.

Drones
 can also be used to fly to toxic locations such as nuclear waste to 
safe locations and take the place of humans surveying dangerous habitats
 and wastelands such as Fukushima.

They can additionally prove useful in the search for ancient sites and identify sites for archaeological digs.

Both Google and Facebook are interested in using the technology to provide internet access in remote areas.

In this way, people can choose an aerial video of the Las Vegas Strip, or weave between the elaborate towers of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

In recent years, some travel companies have started to make videos filmed by drones to show off hotels, cruises and holiday destinations.

These videos join those created by amateurs who have submitted their aerial masterpieces to be included on the map, Skift reported.

A team checks through the submissions to ensure they really were filmed by drones.

If they are legitimate, the footage is geographically tagged and added to the map.

As might be expected, there are more places filmed in the U.S. and Europe, but more remote exotic locations have also been captured.

Users can selection a location on a map of the world, and zoom in to see drone videos pinpointed on certain locations. Most videos are pinned to the U.S. and Europe (pictured), but there are others in more exotic and unusual locations
