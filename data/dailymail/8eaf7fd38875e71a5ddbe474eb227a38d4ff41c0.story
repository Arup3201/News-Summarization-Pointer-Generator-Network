A pregnant woman who sexually abused a nine-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl to please a man she had never met has been jailed for six years.

Marie Raison, 25, sent disturbing images of her touching the two young children sexually to Paul Dent, 29, a paedophile she met online.

The pair met on an internet dating site and their conversations quickly turned to sex.

Paul Dent, who has a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child, actively encouraged Raison to molest the young children

Dent, who has a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child, actively encouraged Raison to molest the young children so he could satisfy his own desires, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard yesterday.

Raison, a former school cleaner and nursery nurse, was pregnant with another man’s child at the time of the offences between May and July last year.

When she was arrested Raison tried to blame her sister for taking the photos while Dent told officers he was angry that not enough women were being jailed for child sex offences.

Jailing Dent for seven years and Raison for six years Judge Martin Zeidman QC, said: ‘Ms Raison, this was the most horrific of offences.

‘It is important to note that this was not just a plan, it was a conspiracy that was implemented and undertaken on a number of occasions.

‘You, Dent, did not of course physically carry out the assaults but you pressed vigorously for more and more images and showed great irritation when they did not come as quickly as you wanted.

‘And to make it worse you have a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child.

‘Of course it was you Raison who actually did the physical acts but it was you Dent who enthusiastically pressed her to do so.

‘That said, there was nothing to prevent you Raison from discontinuing the internet conversation - he was not with you or in your home - you could have just stopped all communication but you wanted it to continue.

‘I have reached the conclusion that you are both as bad as each other.

‘I make it absolutely clear that I totally reject the suggestion your sister played a part in creating or sending these images.'

Raison and Dent showed no emotion as they were jailed.

A series of messages and pictures were found on Raison's phone both sent to and received from Dent

Prosecutor Charlotte Newell said: ‘They met on the internet and it quickly progressed into Dent asking Raison to sexually abuse the children.

‘Suffice to say he indicated he would like to visit her which she encouraged - he had made it plain that his own sexual fantasies with the children included sexual intercourse.

‘It was only discovered when a friend found the messages on her phone being exchanged.

‘They were arrested in their respective parts of the country and their computers, laptops and phones were searched.’

A series of messages and pictures were found on Raison’s phone both sent to and received from Dent.

In interview Raison said she had only had Dent’s number because her sister had told her to contact him.

She also said she had met her sister every day that week but prosecutor Ms Newell described Raison’s excuses as ‘a pack of lies.’

Dent told police he had received a random text from Raison and the last time he had spoken to her he had asked her to stop sending the pictures.

He also told police he was angry about the ratio of men to women that had been convicted of child sex offences and so he had amassed the messages to see how far she would go.

Both children are in foster care and have suffered no apparent physical or psychological harm.

Ms Newell added: ‘It can only be speculation at this stage but both children haven’t shown any signs of physical or psychological harm.’

Dent has since expressed a desire to under-go sexual offences prevention treatment.

Raison, of Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, and Dent of Washington, Tyne and Wear, admitted two counts of conspiracy to commit sexual activity with a child and one of conspiracy to take indecent photos of a child.

Three counts of encouraging and assisting in the commission of an offence, two of sexual activity with a child and eight of possession of indecent photographs of a child were all left to lie on the court file.
