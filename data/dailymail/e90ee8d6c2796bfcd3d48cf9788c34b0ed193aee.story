Rio Ferdinand has all the qualities to be 'another Michel Platini' and take up a role running the game, according to QPR boss Harry Redknapp.

Ferdinand is in contention to be the Football Association's candidate for Britain's FIFA vice-presidential position despite his current playing commitments at Loftus Road.

The 35-year-old defender is coming to the end of an illustrious playing career that has included winning six Premier League titles, the Champions League and playing at two World Cups.

Ferdinand spent seven years under Redknapp's tutelage at West Ham and the now-QPR boss has no doubt the former Manchester United defender has a lot to offer the game once he hangs up his boots.

'He could be another Michel Platini (UEFA president) - that'd be nice for him and why not?' Redknapp said.

'He's a bright boy and a lovely guy - an absolute class act on and off the field - he's smart and a top boy.'

Ferdinand, who grew up in Peckham in south London, has shown a strong interest in community work in the past.

He set up The Rio Ferdinand Foundation, which uses role models to help children in education and employment, as well as taking an active role in anti-racism, Aids awareness and child literacy campaigns.

'We need more people like him running the game,' Redknapp said. 'He's got great knowledge of the game and is a great role model.

'He's come out of a working class area in south London area and he's made it.

'I've known him since he was 14 and he's a fantastic boy and he hasn't changed a bit as a person, he's just got a bit more experience now but as a person he's top class.'

Ferdinand has played every minute of QPR's five league games so far and is set to start at the heart of the defence for Saturday's trip to high-flying Southampton.

The veteran has predominantly been used in a central defensive trio this season and while Redknapp reverted to a back four against Stoke last weekend, the QPR boss says 3-5-2 remains an option.

'I had thought about it this week, it's in my mind,' Redknapp said.

'I spoke to the coaches, we had a meeting and chatted about it - it's something that I wouldn't discard.

'I bought the little right back Mauricio Isla in to play right wing back from Juventus and Armand Traore is a left wing back really.

'I've also got five centre halves and I like all of them - to play three of them would suit us fine.'

QPR face a tough trip to Ronald Koeman's Southampton this weekend, who have started the season superbly

Southampton have dispelled doubts surrounding their summer transfer policy by taking 10 points from their opening five games and beating Arsenal in the Capital One cup on Tuesday.

The Saints' excellent start under new boss Ronald Koeman sees them sitting second in the  Premier League table, three points behind Chelsea.

'I've been very surprised at how well they've done, it's been amazing,' said Redknapp, who managed Southampton for a year from December 2004.

'They keep producing good players there, they've got this conveyor belt of kids coming through.

'They've bought well - Ronald Koeman has got a couple of good players from Holland that he knew and they're a powerful outfit again.'
