Just one council has sought to restore weekly bin collections using a flagship £250million Government fund – and now even that one has decided not to go ahead because it would be too expensive.

In opposition, David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles repeatedly pledged to restore the ‘fundamental right’ to a weekly bin round, and on winning power unveiled a scheme encouraging councils to do so.

The £250million fund was meant to be used to allow local authorities to return to and support existing weekly collections – or invest in schemes that would benefit the environment, such as by raising recycling rates.

But Mr Pickles has even struggled to convince councils that collect all bins weekly to carry on doing so – let alone persuade those who have axed them to rethink. Only around a third of the bids submitted by 2012 were aimed at retaining a weekly collection. Others sought funding for recycling services.

Now, in an embarrassing blow, the only council to sign up to the original plan to revert from fortnightly to weekly collections has decided not to continue.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles helped create a £250million fund  meant for weekly collections and environmental schemes

Stoke-on-Trent City Council was awarded £14.3million from the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2012 to revert to weekly household waste collections for a minimum of five years.

But city officials have now told the Government that the plans would be too expensive and fall foul of a new European Union waste directive. 

Andy Platt, of Stoke council, said a series of ‘massive budget cuts’ meant the Government cash would not cover the cost of weekly collections.

Hilary Benn, Labour’s spokesman on communities and local government, said: ‘Eric Pickles blustered for years that he would return England to weekly bin collections but this has now been exposed as nothing but pompous hot air.

‘What’s worse is that the quarter of a billion pounds he spent on trying to persuade councils to switch to weekly collections appears to have been a complete waste of money; money that could have been spent on protecting other services.’

He accused Mr Pickles of making claims ‘he never had the power to implement’ and added: ‘In politics, you need to say what you mean and mean what you say. Eric Pickles does neither.’

Setting up the fund in 2011, the Communities Secretary said it would help authorities ‘deliver weekly collections’ but the Daily Mail revealed last month that families now have to wait 12 days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected. 

 

They also have to contend with an average of nearly four different bins.

Local government minister Kris Hopkins accused Mr Benn of hypocrisy, saying that he was the ‘architect’ of fortnightly bin collections under Labour.

‘Conservatives in Government have taken a series of steps to protect weekly collections, and without our active support, weekly collections would have disappeared in England by this year, as has happened in Labour-run Wales,’ said Mr Hopkins.

‘We will be taking further steps to support people’s right to have a frequent and comprehensive rubbish and recycling service.’
