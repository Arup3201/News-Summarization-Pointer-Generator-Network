He is competing in the current series of Dancing On Ice and consistently tops the judges' leader board.

And firm favourite Ray Quinn, 25, has every reason to celebrate after revealing he lost two stone to take part in the show.

The West End star swapped Chinese takeaways and cans of lager for healthy eating and regular gym sessions - and the results are outstanding.

Ray (before, left) would have a friend breakfast daily, but has now cut out pasta, potatoes & bread (after, right)

Cutting out potatoes, pasta and bread through the Caveman Diet high in protein and fresh veg the star dropped 28lbs in eight weeks.

Former X Factor star Ray - who is 5ft 9" - went down from a bloated 14st to a lean and ripped 12st.

'When I got the call from ITV asking me to take part in Dancing On Ice I knew I had to take action,' he said.

'I had 10-12 weeks to lose two stone, and I was so determined I reached my target in eight weeks. Dancing on Ice was the kick start I needed.'.

'The training is gruelling enough- up to 12 hours a day - so I wouldn't have got through the first day had not got fit beforehand.'

To help him reach his goal Ray admitted to asking everyone and anyone for nutritional and training advice.

He was bloated at 14 stone and with 20 per cent body fat

He said: 'I started going to the gym five times a week, building up on weights and doing lots of pull-ups and press-ups.

'I'd go up to other men in the gym and ask; ‘what should I be eating? Am I doing this right?' And they'd be happy to give me tips.'

The dad-of-one, who is married to actress Emma Stephens, said his busy work schedule meant he was eating convenience foods touring theatres in the UK. 

No fat, no stodge, says Ray, who eats good fats like avocado - but not greasy foods

'I'd have a bacon sarnie everyday for breakfast, or a full fry up,' he said. 'They a mayo heavy pre-packed sandwich, with crisps and full-fat coke for lunch.

'I couldn't get enough of pizza, chips, KFC or Chinese meals after each show. I'd like a drink or two, easily washing down six cans of lager a night. That's a lot! It really bloated me out.'

On deciding to make a change Ray transformed his diet and is now reaping the results - showing off a defined six pack and muscular toned arms.

Breakfast: Fried bacon and eggs

Snack: Coke and crisps

Lunch: Pizza and chips/ Pre-packed sandwiches and crisps

Snack: Chocolate bar and fizzy drink

Dinner: Chinese or fried chicken take-away with 4-6 cans of lager

Breakfast: Bowl of porridge. Protein shake after work-out with one spoon of peanut butter

Snack: 3-4 fruitsand handful of almonds

Lunch: Steak, green salad and cous cous

Snack: dried meat biltong

Dinner at 6pm: Lean turkey breast, sweet potato, green veg. Protein shake at 8pm

'I cut out potatoes, bread and pasta to start with. I now have sweet potato with lean turkey instead of chicken, which is lower in fat. I'm eating little and often and I'm never hungry.

'I have so much more energy now. If you put a huge log on a fire it goes out, eating a small amounts more often is so much better.'

Ray now starts his day with a hearty bowl of porridge, always gets his five a day and drinks lots of water.

'No fat, no stodge,' he said. 'I'll have good fats like avocado - but not greasy foods. I had a potbelly and I hated it.'

He added: 'It hasn't been easy. I don't even have milk in my tea anymore! But I'm keeping it off this time, there's no going back. I feel and look so much better.'

But he does have the occasional cheat day. 'Every second Sunday I eat whatever I want for a day, whatever I'm craving most,' he said.

'You have to have a cheat day - I'd never stick to this tough regime if I didn't have that.'

Ray, who is married to actress Emma Stephens, said another key part of his diet success was taking Forza T5 Super Strength fat burner supplements.

The pills claim to help boost physical endurance, muscle development, burn fat and reduce fatigue.

He said: 'FORZA T5 helped to reduce my snacking cravings, increased fat burning and also provided energy and protein.

'I
 took two capsules most mornings - these kick start the fat burning 
process and gave me more tone and muscle definition.' He also took them in the mid-afternoon to prevent 
snacking and cravings.

Ray, who won the Dancing On Ice crown in 2009, is back on the show for a second attempt to win the coveted winner's trophy with his with pro partner Maria Filippov.

But the competition is fierce as he is up against past winners such as Hayley Tamaddon (Series 5) and Beth Tweddle (Series 8) to name a few.
