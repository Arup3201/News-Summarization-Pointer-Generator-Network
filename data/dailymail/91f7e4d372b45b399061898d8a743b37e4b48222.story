Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home

Police are continuing to question three teenagers today over the murder of a surgeon outside his millionaires' row home.

Anthony Owen, 68, was found unconscious 20 yards from the property next to his white Honda Civic, which was still running.

Two neighbours, in the affluent Hale Village in Widnes, Cheshire, called an ambulance and Mr Owen was taken to hospital.

However, the cancer specialist is not thought to have regained consciousness, and died on Saturday.

Last night, murder detectives 
arrested the youths after witnesses 
reported seeing three youngsters cycling away on BMX-style bikes from Mr Owen’s 1920s' 
thatched villa.

Cheshire Police said three teenagers, aged 14, 16 and 17, all from Widnes, were arrested yesterday and remained in custody.

Shocked residents described the surgeon, who was semi-retired, as a ‘pillar of the community’.

A
wealthy enclave popular with the city’s professionals, the Cheshire 
village is sandwiched between the town of Widnes and Liverpool’s 
deprived Speke estate.

Mr 
Owen – who is thought to have been unmarried – was discovered at about 
10.20pm on Sunday, March 11 with head injuries. He was sprawled across 
the pavement with his head lying in the road.

He was taken to Walton Neurological Centre in Liverpool but later died.

Police quickly ruled out the 
possibility that he had been hit by a car and said they were keeping an 
open mind as to whether he had fallen and hit his head.

Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. A witness reported seeing three youths on BMX bikes tearing away from the area minutes before his body was found

After decades of working as an oncologist, Mr Owen was still doing locum work at  Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales.

The devout Catholic had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years, nursing his mother Anne, herself a retired doctor, until she died in 2003.

Patricia King, who has lived next to Mr Owen for more than three decades, said he was ‘dedicated to his profession’.

‘Anthony was a dear friend and neighbour, and we will miss him dearly,’ she added. ‘He saved many lives.’

Barbara Myers, 70, whose husband Harold was treated by Mr Owen when he fell during a stroke, said: ‘He was a very good friend.

‘There have been a lot of problems in the street because we are an ageing group and Anthony was always there if he was needed.

‘I was at a party in Manchester recently and one of Anthony’s cancer patients came over to me and asked me to remember her to him.

‘She was hugely grateful to him for saving her life. He was more than just a decent bloke and the community is a lot poorer without him.’

Another neighbour, Jane Teebay, who is retired, added: ‘He was one of the most wonderful people I knew and we’re all desperately upset. He was a caring, fine, clever man.’

Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours

And Pixie Spencer, a close friend, said: ‘He was quite sociable and well-liked. People invited him to anything that went on in the road.

‘He was the last person I thought of as a pensioner because he was so active and did a lot to help people around here.’

William Stephens, 42, who runs a local website and knew Mr Owen for 11 years, paid tribute to him as an ‘eminent doctor’.

‘Whenever I was out painting the parish gates or tidying the garden he would always come over and tell me I was doing a good job,’ he said.

‘He was very pleasant and very nice. Everyone in the  village is talking about his death but nobody knows what happened.’

Witnesses have described two of the suspects as sharing a BMX-style bike. The third man was standing up as he rode a second bike.

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said Mr Owen had suffered a severe head injury.

She said: ‘The teenagers – aged 14, 16 and 17 who are  all from Widnes − have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody helping police with their inquiries.’

She added that the attempted theft of Mr Owen's car was not currently a line of inquiry.

Mr Owen’s death has echoes of the killing of Garry Newlove, who was murdered by a gang of drink-fuelled youths.

The 47-year-old died two days after confronting  the gang when his wife’s car was damaged outside their home in Warrington in August 2007.

Now a Tory peer, his widow has campaigned to highlight the costs of binge drinking.
