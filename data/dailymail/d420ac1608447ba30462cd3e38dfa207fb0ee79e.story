Microsoft has scrapped plans to restrict used games on its Xbox One console after widespread criticism.

The decision came after rivals Sony announced its cheaper PlayStation 4 would not limit gamers to only playing new software.

Microsoft will now remove any DRM - digital rights management - banning any trade-in and used games from its next-generation Xbox One, which was unveiled last month.

Microsoft's Don Mattrick announced the following changes on the backtracking Xbox Wire blog:

An internet connection will not be required to play offline Xbox One games.

After a one-time system set-up with a new Xbox One, you can play any disc based game without ever connecting online again.

There is no 24-hour connection requirement and you can take your Xbox One anywhere you want and play your games, just like on Xbox 360.

Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today.

There will be no limitations to using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on Xbox 360.

In addition to buying a disc from a retailer, you can also download games from Xbox Live on day of release.

If you choose to download your games, you will be able to play them offline just like you do today.

Xbox One games will be playable on any Xbox One console -- there will be no regional restrictions. 

Don Mattrick, President of Microsoft Interactive, said the company had 'heard loud and clear' what fans had to say.

Writing on the Xbox Wire blog, Mattrick said: 'You told us how much you loved the flexibility you have today with games delivered on disc.

'The ability to lend, share, and resell these games at your discretion is of incredible importance to you.

'Also important to you is the freedom to play offline, for any length of time, anywhere in the world.

'Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today - there will be no limitations to using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on Xbox 360.

'While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content.

'We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds.'

Sony gaming boss Jack Tretton said: 'PS4 will not impose any new restrictions on your use of PS4 game discs.'

The decision by Microsoft does come at a price though as Bill Gates' company have now scrapped any plans to offer discounts when trading-in download-only games.

Microsoft's Xbox One will launch in November. It has improved voice recognition and gesture controls, built-in Skype features and multi-tasking Snap Mode. Microsoft originally planned to restrict the use of second-hand games but has now backtracked

Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One during a
press event in May with pricing and more specific detail announced later at the E3 conference in Los Angeles.

The compay initially was planning to let game publishers set the rules for reselling games to retailers.

'We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers,' the company posted on the Xbox news Web site.

'Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.'

The company also clamped down on gamers being able to share titles with friends.

Microsoft said no fees will be charged when games were transferred but gamers could only share games with people who have been on their friends list for at least 30 days.

And each game could only be given once.

And although Microsoft said the Xbox One didn't need to be connected constantly, gamers were told they would only be able to play offline for up to 24 hours on a main console, or one hour if logged onto someone else's console when accessing their games and media from the cloud.

Between the two events the company was forced to write a blog post explaining what would happen with used games on the console.

The Xbox One goes on sale in November priced £429 while Sony's PlayStation 4 will cost £350.

When unveiling details of the Xbox One, Microsoft said it would be completely
controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures, and with the new 
Instant Switching feature users can ask the Xbox to 'watch TV', 'open 
Internet Explorer' or use it to change channels quickly without having 
to find the remote control. 

Microsoft's Xbox One also comes with a
multi-tasking Snap Mode that lets users run more than one service at 
any one time, such as watch a film while checking emails on Internet 
Explorer.

Microsoft executives touted the Xbox One as a replacement for the set-top box.

It was also revealed that Xbox Live - the online game and media centre - 
will no longer limit users to 100 friends and that Microsoft points will be 
scrapped in favour of real money.

Attendees await the start of the Microsoft Xbox E3 2013 Media Briefing in Los Angeles. At the event, bosses confirmed the new console will cost $499 or £429 - and the Xbox 360 will be updated to look more like an Xbox One
