Cara, the bushy-browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in enquiries

The 'power brow' shows no sign of falling out of fashion thanks to Cara Delevingne.

According to a cosmetic surgery group the bushy-browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in the number of women looking to fill in their sparse eyebrows with a transplant.

New stats from Transform reveal that they have seen enquiries about eyebrow transplants - which cost about £1,500 - increase by 45 per cent since 2010.

The average age of those enquiring is 30, and the group report that 70 per cent of callers admit they have previously over-plucked.

Despite the hefty price tag more women than ever are now considering paying out for the treatment.

Transform believes this is in part due to many finding that the 90s trend for thin, over-plucked eyebrows has left them with sparse brows - and what it is calling 'the Delevingne effect'.

Cara’s coveted brows are so popular that they even have their own social media accounts, with one Twitter account boasting almost 5,000 followers, reports the Express.

Hair transplant surgeon at Transform, Dr Mabroor Bhatty, said: 'The rise in enquires for this treatment comes mainly from women who have previously over-plucked, which can permanently damage the follicle leaving them with thinning or virtually no eyebrows.

'As fashions have changed, women are looking to reverse these effects with the treatment. 

'Eyebrow transplant procedures are performed in the same way as a hair transplant, by taking a strip of hair from the donor site; usually at the back of the head at the lower hair margin, where the hair is finer.

'This strip is divided into single hair follicles before each follicle is individually transplanted to incisions made in the eyebrows.

'As is the case with a standard hair transplant, it is normal to see hairs falling out for the first six weeks. However, new hair will grow on average between two to three months after the procedure, creating the desired thickening effect.'

But the follically challenged need not despair if their brows are more Sarah Harding than Cara Delevingne: we have entered the age of the eyebrow extension.

The process, Brow Perfect, involves carefully gluing individual synthetic hairs onto existing fine hairs, or directly onto the skin.

This latest launch from company Lash Perfect aims to fill in gaps, add volume and extend the brow line.

The salon treatment is aimed at those experiencing age-related hair loss or those who have over-plucked or waxed their brows in the past. 

The process gives a texture and realistic look to brows that pencils and pencils and powders can't attain, say Lash Perfect.

The brow extensions are available in different shades and can be glued on to create the type of arch desired.

'We do eyebrows to suit the age and shape of each individual customer,' explains Beverly Piper, owner and director of Lash Perfect.

'Nobody's brows are the same,' she says.

'People find they have natural gaps, or perhaps they over plucked when they were younger.

'Up until now, the only way to bride the gap was to use powder or a pencil, which gives a flat look. But now you can have depth and dimension with the eyebrow extensions.'

The beauty professional recognises fashion's influence on modern women's love of big brows.

'Cara Delevingne has amazing brows and carries them off beautifully. She has given women the license to wear their eyebrows boldly and beautifully without needing them trimmed all the time,' says Piper.

'Brow Perfect is all about bold and beautiful brows. Fashions do change but gaps in brows will never be in.'
