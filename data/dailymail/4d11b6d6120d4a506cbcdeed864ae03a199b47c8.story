A married couple on benefits lived in a string of luxury homes before fleeing without paying rent, reports today suggest.

Housing benefit claimers Amanda and Derek Finnigan, both 35, who have seven children together, have rented three luxury homes across Scotland since September 2011, it is claimed.

It is alleged that in each instance, they have fled the luxurious homes without paying rent - leaving three separate landlords out of pocket.

Now, the couple are alleged to owe a total £21,000 in rent arrears to the home owners.

But Mrs Finnigan has defended the couple's actions, saying they need large properties as they are a nine-person family and that their choice of home has 'nothing to do with luxury'.

She also denies fleecing any of the landlords.

She added her family have been smeared as fraudsters - and that they didn't pay rent on one property because of extensive repair costs they were forced to make.

According to Daily Record, the couple moved in to their first luxury home in September 2011.

Two months after tying the knot, the couple moved their family into a four-bedroom detached home in Giffnock, East Renfrewshire.

The property was advertised as costing £1100-a-month.

Landlord Ian Anderson claims he was forced to take legal action when the couple missed several rent payments.

Mr and Mrs Finnigan left the property in July 2012 - two days before the case reached court, the landlord said.

He claims the couple still owe him £6,000.

The couple then moved to a seven-bedroom home in Thorntonhall, South Lanarkshire. The rent on the property was £2,500-a-month.

John Campbell, who owns the property, says after paying a deposit the couple failed to pay rent for nine months.

Mr Campbell says he eventually told the council to begin paying their housing benefit directly to him.

When the pair left in April 2013 they owed him £15,000, Mr Campbell claims.

But Mrs Finnigan says the family do not owe the landlord anything as they were forced to make a stream of repair costs when they lived in the property.

She also says the family were harassed by Mr Campbell - a claim he strongly denies.

Speaking with the newspaper, he said: 'One can only fear for the next victim. As for harassment on my part, this is complete fiction.'

The couple have recently left a third property - a detached, five-bedroom home in Busby, East Renfrewshire. The rent for the property was £1,395.

Landlord Nick Barrat claims the cheque the couple paid for the deposit on the property plus one month's rent bounced.

The landlord says despite arranging for housing benefit to be paid directly to him, the couple owe him £3,000 in rent.

Mrs Finnigan admits she owes Mr Barrat £3,000.

Speaking with Sally Hind from the newspaper, Mrs Finnigan said: 'I need five bedrooms. I have seven kids. The best option for us is to stay in a private rent and find whatever surplus there is.

'It has nothing to do with luxury.'

She added the family were now in the process of moving into a smaller privately rented home.

Efforts are currently being made by MailOnline to speak with the Finnigans and all landlord involved.
