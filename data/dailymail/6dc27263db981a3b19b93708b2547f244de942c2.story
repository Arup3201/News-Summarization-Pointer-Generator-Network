For parents, the possibility of a child falling into a pool unattended and drowning is a very real and concerning threat.

So to put their mind at ease, one company has designed a headband that alerts a parent’s smartphone if a child accidentally falls in water.

By syncing with an iOS device, the sensor sends a warning via Bluetooth and lets the adult come to the aid of their child as quickly as possible.

A Connecticut-based company has revealed a device to keep kids safe near water. The £58 ($99) iSwimband alerts parents when their children have fallen into a pool. It can also let parents know when their kids have been underwater too long. In both instances an alarm is sent to the parent's phone to warn them

The waterproof device is known as the iSwimband and costs aroun $99 (around £60).

iSwimband is a small, wireless sensor that is worn either as a headband or a wristband says thecompany.

The sensor is paired with a compatible Bluetooth-enabled smart device running the free iSwimband app. 

When both the sensor and app are activated, the app continually monitors the status of the sensor. 

If the app determines that the sensor has been submerged into water, or submerged for a (user-definable) dangerous period of time, it notifies the caregiver via audiovisual alerts.

The caregiver can then investigate the circumstances and intervene if necessary.

The device apparently has a battery life of hundreds of hours of active monitoring.

It has an effective range of 100 feet (30 metres) or more. 

It sits around the head of a child and has a Bluetooth-enabled sensor at the front.

There is also a wristband option available.

The wristband version is designed for children who are non-swimmers and fall into a pool by mistake.

When the device detects the child has fallen into water, it sends an alert immediately to the parent so they can come and rescue them.

The headband version, meanwhile, is designed for slightly older children who are able to swim.

It detects when a child has been underwater for too long, perhaps because they are struggling to swim to the surface.

In this instance an alarm will again sound on the phone, alerting the parent to come and save their child.

Up to eight iSwimbands can be synced to any one iOS device.

Speakers can also be linked to provide louder alerts.

However, the company adds that it is important the parent knows the general location their child is in, as the device does not have GPS, although this is something they to add in future.

'iSwimband is the world's first wearable sensor designed to alert you with an audible/visual alarm on your smartphone or tablet (and linked speakers) if a swimmer has been submerged dangerously long, or if your non-swimmer enters the water,' the company says on their website.

'While nothing can replace diligent human supervision, iSwimband provides you and your loved ones with an added layer of protection around water.'
