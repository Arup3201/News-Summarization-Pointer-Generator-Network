Relieved: A laughing Jim Davidson put on a confident performance in Torquay yesterday despite his ordeal

Jim Davidson made his first live performance yesterday after being told he is to face no further action over allegations he sexually assaulted ten women - as it was revealed he was offered a 'mind-blowing' deal to join Celebrity Big Brother as soon as the allegations were dropped.

The veteran comedian turned down the offer because he still faces one claim.

Mr Davidson confidently strolled onstage to applause and cheers from hundreds of fans at the Princess Theatre in Torquay, Devon, where he performed a series of his famous controversial gags as part of his You Must Be Joking tour.

The former Big Break host began the adult-only show with the words: 'No further action' - to which the crowd burst into claps and whoops.

Mr Davidson said: 'It's weird that you're all clapping as if I have won something when really nothing has changed. The police have decided no further action and I'm very pleased.'

The 59-year-old then thanked his fans for all their support, and added: 'To those of you that have bothered writing and twittering, thank you.

'It's been nine months of murder really but the great thing about being innocent is that all you've got is the truth, you can't make anything up so I was f*****.'

Mr Davidson was arrested in January and again in March as part of Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

But the Crown Prosecution Service last night said the women's allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction.

When he heard the news, Mr Davidson said: 'I'm very pleased that it has now all blown over.'

Mr Davidson told a reporter sat outside his £850,000 riverside home in Stockbridge, Hampshire, that he was back to work as normal.

Speaking over the phone, he said: 'I'm in Torquay at the moment, preparing for a performance tonight.

'I'm very pleased there's going to be no further action.

'The police contacted my lawyer who informed me yesterday that I wouldn't be facing further action. 

Reprieve: Jim Davidson said he was pleased his ordeal had 'blown over'

'I'm very pleased that it has now all blown over. I have no further comment to make.'

He added: I've been through tough times before and got through, and I will come through this. It will all be fine.'

A TV source said: 'Channel Five were absolutely desperate to get Jim on as they know what a controversial figure he can be and were convinced he would make great viewing.'

Celebrity Big Brother started last night with stars including ex-Corrie actor Bruce Jones.

Bosses have not ruled out Davidson joining the house if his final allegation - an alleged indecent assault on a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s - is dropped, according to The Sun.

It is up to the Falklands’ attorney general Mark Lewis to consult lawyers before deciding whether he should be prosecuted.

He is due to play the Princess Theatre in Torquay, Devon, tonight as part of his 'You Must Be Joking' tour.

Last night a woman in her late-fifties answered the door of his Georgian home, claiming to be a neighbour who was house-sitting.

She said: 'We are all thrilled to hear no further action is being taken against Jim. We are really pleased for him.'

Mr Davidson has consistently denied the allegations against him, which included one dating back 35 years.

The TV star was detained at Heathrow 
in January as he arrived back in the UK ahead of a planned appearance on
reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother.

Mr Davidson had flown into London to give a series of interviews to journalists in advance of his appearance on the show.

TV executives quickly held crisis meetings and replaced him with someone else.

After
his initial arrest he told friends: 'I am no Jimmy Savile. I have never
forced myself on a girl in my life. I once let a drunken dancer sleep 
in my bed, but I never touched her. I am a gentleman.'

Last
night a CPS spokesman said: 'We have determined that there is 
insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in relation
to all complaints and have advised the Metropolitan Police Service that
no further action should be taken.

No further action: Jim Davidson was told last night the Crown Prosecution Service had decided the evidence against him was simply not strong enough

'All
those involved have been informed of the decisions, and, as is normal, 
should any of the complainants request a meeting to discuss these 
decisions we would be happy to meet with them.'

Mr Davidson's solicitor said his client was 'pleased' with the development.

Henri
Brandman said: 'My client Jim Davidson was, of course, arrested a 
number of months ago in respect of allegations of a historical sexual 
nature.

'He is pleased to have received news today that there will be no further action relating to the allegations.'

Accusations: Mr Davidson was arrested under Operation Yewtree which was sparked by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal. However, the comedian has now been told he will face no further action

Mike Osman, a DJ and friend of Mr Davidson, was also told yesterday that he would not be charged.

The 53-year-old, from Rownhams near Southampton, was arrested in January.

He was accused of sexually assaulting one of the ten women linked to Mr Davidson. Mr Osman was unavailable for comment last night.

Three people have so far been charged under Operation Yewtree.

Last week DJ Dave Lee Travis was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s.

He will appear at Westminster magistrates’ court tomorrow.

PR supremo Max Clifford 70, who is 
accused of indecently assaulting seven women and girls, and former BBC 
driver David Smith, 67, who is accused of sexually abusing a young boy, 
will face trial next year.

Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, 83, Gary Glitter, 69, and Freddie Starr, 70, are all on bail.
