An iconic artwork of 12 tumbling red phone boxes in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, has allegedly been damaged in a publicity stunt by the Cath Kidston homeware chain.

They added their trademark white spots - as Christmas snow - together with their company logo, to the 1987 piece Out of Order, by sculptor David Mach.

Local Conservation group the Kingston Society say light red and grey spots are still visible where the dots appear to have been lifted off.

A spokeswoman for Mr Mach said the artist had initially consulted a solicitor over potential legal action, but has since decided not to pursue the case.

She said: 'They did something without telling us first, then sent David an email telling him about it with a picture.

'David sat back at first and said no problem, until the Kingston Society got in touch to say what they did had damaged the sculpture.

'The next step for us is to go and have a look.

'David won't be too happy if they have repainted it the wrong colour, but maybe it's time to talk to the council and see what they have to say.

The project enabled the phone boxes' broken panels to be repaired and the phone boxes are going to be completely repainted

'There's not much we can do about it now but if they want to do anything else with it then they should ask us first.'

Kingston Society chairman Jennifer Butterworth said: 'We were dismayed that this was being done without the artist's consent, let alone knowledge.

'I'm yet to be convinced that the application of white snowflakes did not damage the boxes.

'This particular piece of artwork needs high maintenance if it is to remain witty and amusing, and not tatty.

'We abhor the use of it for advertising.'

A Kingstonfirst spokesman said: 'This was
 a hugely successful campaign for Kingston - over 700,000 people have 
engaged on social media and online really putting Kingston on the map.

'The project enabled the phone boxes' broken panels to be repaired and the phone boxes are going to be completely repainted, putting them in the best condition they have been in since their launch.

'These telephone boxes are our version of I Am Amsterdam - it's our iconic piece of art where every visitor has their photo taken with and something we should constantly promote and celebrate.'

An entry on the Cath Kidston website says: 'Kingston's famous 'falling over phone boxes' have been wrapped in our classic Spot Red print for Christmas.

'You'll find them on Old London Road, home to the town's antiques emporium and quirky independent shops.

'The boxes, officially named 'Out of Order' by artist David Mach, are one of Kingston's best known landmarks.
