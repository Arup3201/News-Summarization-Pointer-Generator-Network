West Ham boss Sam Allardyce faces the sack before the season starts.

Football Grapevine can reveal that the owners of the east London club had come to an agreement to give Big Sam ten games into the new season to assess the situation.

But after David Sullivan’s criticism of Allardyce, especially with regard to the £15million signing of Andy Carroll last summer, matters have come to a head and caused a massive issue between the dynamic of co-owner David Gold, and assistant Karren Brady.

Facing the axe: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce's tenure could be over before the new season

Rift: After David Sullivan¿s (left) criticism of Allardyce, matters have come to a head and caused a massive issue between the dynamic of co-owner David Gold (right) and assistant Karren Brady (centre)

Football Grapevine has been told that if the club were floundering in October, Allardyce would be sacked and paid off.

But issues over the buying of players and complications involving favoured agents have now come into the equation.

As revealed in this column nine months ago there is a big issue between the club's owner and Allardyce over the future of Ravel Morrison.

Gus Poyet and Slaven Bilic are two potential successors to Allardyce.

Bench mark: David Sullivan has admitted the club put all their eggs in one basket when signing Andy Carroll

Difference of opinion: While Allardyce doesn't want to keep him, West Ham want Morrison to stay

 

Woodward moving to avoid United getting caught out

Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward is seeking to finalise a series of signings over the next fortnight.

Why is Arsene 
Wenger moaning about Arsenal’s commercially led pre season schedule?

Why didn’t he put his foot down when the arrangements were being made?

Given the complexities of top end deals especially after a World Cup he has a long shortlist.

But that is not a scattergun approach, just a way of making sure the club don’t get caught out like they were last summer when they devoted most of their time and focus trying to sign Cristiano Ronaldo.

When that fell through the club ran out of time to pursue other targets and David Moyes’ ill fated reign was undermined from the outset because of a decaying squad.

Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid’s Angel di Maria (who is also wanted by PSG), and Edinson Cavani of PSG are three prime targets. As is Dutchman Kevin Strootman of Roma.

Forward fast: Woodward will continue to chase Mats Hummels (top left), Angel di Maria (top right), Kevin Strootman (bottom left) and Edinson Cavani (bottom right) as United's chief seeks to learn from mistakes

 

Liverpool eye up Vermaelen

Liverpool are set to make another attempt to lure Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal.

But the Belgium international centre-half’s head could be turned by reported interest from Barcelona.

Wanted man: Arsenal and Belgium defender Vermaelen is being courted again by Liverpool

 

Chelsea make move for Brazilian Firmino

Having lured Didier Drogba back to Chelsea to supplement his strike force Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has said he has completed all transfer business.

But the Blues may yet seek to bolster their attacking options by making a move for Brazilian Roberto Firmino. The 22-year-old plays for Hoffenheim and has also attracted the interest of Arsenal.

I am hearing

Ravel Morrison has had a loan move to CSKA Moscow proposed to him.

But the player who wants a new contract with West Ham or a move wants to stay in the Premier League as he seeks to justify the hype about him.

Unwanted: Ravel Morrison is not part of Sam Allardyce's plans at West Ham

 

I am also hearing

Everton, who hope to seal the permanent signing of Romelu Lukaku this week, are also seeking to take another Chelsea player on loan for a season.

Roberto Martinez wants 22-year-old winger Christian Atsu. Aston Villa and West Ham are also interested.

Mon: Steven Gerrard retires as an England… revealed 
firsT here . What a pity Stevie G was not given the skipper’s armband 
ahead of David Beckham.

Tue: Man Utd thrash La Galaxy 7-0 in Van 
Gaal’s first game. Last year they lost 1-0 to the Singha All Stars under
 David Moyes. Proof that rule of fear in football still works.

Weds:
 Frank Lampard finally signs for New York City… as predicted here. What a
 way to end a great career of a great player ridiculously ridiculed by 
so many.

Thurs: Van Gaal quite rightly argues over Man Utd’s 
pre-season worldwide marketing tour. But will the club bend? Van Gaal 
won’t. So could he be a one season wonder.

Fri: Didier Drogba 
returns to Chelsea. Clever buy by Mourinho… then again who recalls what
 happened when the Blues took Peter Osgood back... To find out check out

Libero

It would be naive to read too much into Manchester United’s 7-0 win over LA Galaxy in Louis van Gaal’s first game in charge.

But as predicted Van Gaal set out his stall by playing three at the back, a 3-4-3 cum 3-5-2 system.

It has been the preferred game plan of the Dutch for years.

So it was rather naive for some observers to wax lyrical over some sort of tactical revolution created by Van Gaal.

His system has its DNA in the old WM formation which went out of fashion at the end of the Fifites, when wing halves like Bobby Moore dropped back to become second centre halves.

Even so playing three at the back, either with three centre halves or two backs  with a sweeper, has come in and out of the English game, often with good effect.

Liverpool used it for a period in the Eighties.

And of course it worked well for England under Bobby Robson at Italia 90 and France 98 under Glenn Hoddle.

The mind of the boss: Van Gaal gave a glimpse of his tactical intentions with United in the 7-0 win over LA Galaxy

Indeed Hoddle used the system when in charge at Chelsea and still thinks it is the way forward for the England national side.

But the first team to use to system in the modern era was Notts County who under manager Jimmy Sirrell and influential coach a certain Howard Wilkinson played in the top flight in the early Eighties.

One of the key players of the three man back line was a player called Pedro Richards. A South American? No he was born in Edmonton, north London.

Those who argue English defenders can’t adapt to play three at the back talk tosh. Indeed Van Gaal might even turn Phil Jones and Chris Smalling into international class players.

System: Hoddle used the 3-5-2 system when in charge at Chelsea and still thinks it is the way forward for England

 

Back Heel

Many argued after he announced his international retirement that Steven Gerrard didn’t have many great games in the 114 times he played for England.

That’s a bit harsh but it’s true he was never the constant force of nature for country that he has been for so long for Liverpool.

One stand out display though springs to mind in the early days of his England career was his role in England’s 5-1 over Germany in Munich in 2001.

There were plenty of fine performances by England players that night and Gerrard was brilliant.

Perversely though there is strong argument that that result saw England slide into a comfort zone under Sven Goran Eriksson and the Germans realise they needed to revolutionise the structure of their national game.

Highlight: One of Steven Gerrard's finest hours in an England shirt was in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001
