A fire battalion chief hunted for the killing of his fiancee is a keen outdoorsman and may be hiding out in the mountains, authorities said today.

Police have been trying to find Orville 'Moe' Fleming, 55, since last week.

He is known to frequent the Sierra Mountains, Santa Cruz Mountains and the Yosemite Valley, Sacramento County sheriff's Sergeant Lisa Bowman said.

Fleming is wanted on suspicion of 
fatally stabbing Sarah Jane Douglas, 26, on May 1 in the south 
Sacramento home that he shared with her.

Her butchered body was discovered by her sister.

Fleming fled the scene in his state-issued fire vehicle and has not been seen since.

Fleming, who taught for several years at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's academy in Ione, was fired yesterday after not reporting for duty or calling in for five days, Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said.

Berlant said the termination was automatic because of Fleming's absence from work and has nothing to do with the allegations against him.

A statewide manhunt continues for Fleming, who is believed to have fled the immediate area in an unknown vehicle.

He also has keys to various gates, trails and Cal Fire facilities throughout the state, Bowman said.

Fleming may have changed his appearance by shaving his head or mustache, and he has obvious tattoos on his left arm, Bowman added.

He is also likely to have suffered cuts to one or both of his hands during the alleged killing, Bowman said, and he is believed to be carrying .45- and .25-caliber pistols.
