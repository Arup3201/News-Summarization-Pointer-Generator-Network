The largest warship ever built in the UK has been successfully floated on the water for the first time. 

The 65,000-tonne Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was floated out of the docks at Rosyth shipyard, where she was assembled, into the waters of the Forth of Firth in Scotland.

The carrier was formally named by the Queen earlier this month in a ceremony at the Rosyth Dockyard in Fife, where she was assembled and fitted out.

Afloat for the first time: The HMS Queen Elizabeth was put out on the waters for the first time today, two weeks after it was named by the Queen

Proud... and expensive: The ship is the largest craft that the Navy has ever constructed, and won't be fully operational until the end of the decade

Floating: The ship was steered out of the docks in a three-hour operation and berthed at a nearby jetty - the first time it has travelled afloat since its assembly

In an operation that started earlier this week, the dry dock was flooded for the first time to allow the vessel to float.

It was then manoeuvred out of the dock in a three-hour operation this morning, and berthed at a nearby jetty.

Teams will now continue to fit out the ship and prepare the vessel for sea trials in 2016, and it will be fully operational by 2020.

However, there are continuing doubts over the military's ability to fill out the plane with its full contingent of F-35 Lightning fighter jets. The Queen Elizabeth is equipped to carry 36 of the planes, but so far only three of the 48 ordered from the U.S. manufacturers have arrived.

For the naming ceremony a fortnight ago a dummy version made from aluminium and fibreglass was displayed on top of the craft because no real ones were available to make the journey.

The Government has ordered 48 of the planes in total, and plans to buy more, but it is unclear when the deliveries will finally be made.

One day: This computer-generated image shows how the specially-modified Lightning jets will one day take off and land from the carrier - but for now the jets are suffering setbacks

Ritual: Two weeks ago the Queen attended a naming ceremony at the Rosyth docks near Fife, where she christened the ship with a bottle of whisky

Procession: Dignitaries and military commanders attended the launch, which was punctuated by a flyover the the Red Arrows

The model also suffered a setback this month when U.S. authorities grounded the model after an engine fire. Part of the engine tore through the top of the plane and set alight during an aborted landing at a Florida airbase, causing the whole fleet to be grounded.

The ship and a second vessel, the under-construction HMS Prince of Wales, are the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.

Together they are known as Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers and are being built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA), a partnership of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence.

The vacated dock will be used for the final assembly of HMS Prince of Wales, which will begin in September.

Those behind the project, which costs an estimated £6.2 billion overall, say the QE Class will be the centrepiece of Britain's naval capability.

Each 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide, operating the F-35 Lightning II and a number of types of helicopter.

They will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity, from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.

At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point.

She generates enough energy to power Swindon, she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day - and travel 500 miles a day, too.

Above all, she will be able to deliver 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of British sovereign territory afloat.

Her sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is already in production, though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational, mothballed or sold.

Each ship, which has a life expectancy of around 50 years, will be fitted out with more than three million metres of cable and it will have enough power to light up a small town.

This week, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, described the project as a feat of engineering to match the London Olympics.

You could say much the same about the price - more than £6 billion for the pair. And that does not include the planes.

Each 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide, operating the F-35 Lightning II and a number of types of helicopter. At full capacity, the carrier will be able to launch an aircraft every 30 seconds.

They will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity, from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.

HMS Queen Elizabeth will have 679 permanent crew and capacity for 1,600 crew members when fully operational.

The ship features a new style of 'twin island' command points - one at the front for steering and one at the back for aircraft direction. Thanks to the cutting-edge technology on board, commanders on the bridge will be able to see 250 miles away.

The carrier's range is said to be 10,000 nautical miles and the ship is fitted with a long range 3D radar that is capable of tracking more than 1,000 targets at once or spotting a tennis ball travelling at 2,000 miles per hour.

But the models have yet to be delivered - and the entire U.S. fleet was recently grounded due to engine trouble
