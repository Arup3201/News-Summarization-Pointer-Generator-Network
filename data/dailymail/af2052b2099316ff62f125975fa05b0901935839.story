Samir Nasri has undergone successful surgery on a groin injury as the Manchester City forward begins his recovery.

The France international posted a Twitter picture taken from his hospital bed, accompanied by the caption: 'Thanks for the support! Surgery went well! Now time for the recovery!'.

Nasri was forced to go under the knife after Manuel Pellegrini revealed he was struggling to train. The 27-year-old is expected to miss Premier League matches against Aston Villa, Tottenham and West Ham as as well as Champions League fixtures against Roma and CSKA Moscow.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini confirmed that Nasri was advised to have the operation by the club's doctors 

The Frenchman scored some crucial goals last season but has missed City's last two matches through injury

Before the operation, Pellegrini said: ‘I’m not a doctor but he will be out for around one month.

‘He was training but he wasn’t 100 per cent and he wasn’t comfortable with what he was doing so the doctor decided it was the best option.’

Pellegrini also confirmed that the club could extend Frank Lampard’s loan from New York City FC beyond January.

‘The possibility is to do the best for Manchester City,’ Pellegrini said.

Pellegrini also said that Frank Lampard could stay at the Etihad Stadium beyond January
