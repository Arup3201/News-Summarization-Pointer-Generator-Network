This is the moment a motorist crashed a new £200,000 Ferrari while taking it out for a test drive.

The man was reportedly driving the 14-plate Ferrari F458, which can reach speeds of 202mph, down the overtaking lane of the A12 near Essex when he lost control.

The red supercar spun into a nearby Volkswagen Bora, before smashing into the central reservation, according to witnesses.

Police were called to the scene, where they discovered the remains of the vehicle on the southbound carriageway between Dedham and Langham.

Incredibly, no-one was injured in the crash, which took place just after 10am on July 5.

The Ferrari, a 2014 demo model which is capable of 0-60mph in three seconds, is said to belong to Lancaster Ferrari, a Ferrari dealership based in Colchester.

The
 driver, who was described as wearing an expensive suit, is thought to have been taking the new car, which retails for upwards of £208,000, for a test drive in the hope of later buying it.

'It had been raining just shortly before and I’m guessing they had spun out and hit a nearby car.'
