The distraught brother of an 18-year-old girl who vanished on Thursday, leaving her car parked at her high school, said his sister was not a brat who'd run away.

Massachusetts student Karen Douglas was last seen by her mother at her Newton home about 1pm.

But her devastated parents didn't know she was missing until they attended a parent/teacher conference at school that night, with teachers saying Douglas had missed some classes. 

Found: Police have found the body of Karen Douglas, 18, two days after she went missing. They suspect no foul play

Family members found her unattended car, unlocked, with the keys inside at her assigned student parking space about half a mile away from Newton-North High School later that night.

Newton police said they do not believe foul play is involved, Fox News reported, but her family fears she may have committed suicide.

Police units from Newton, Lowell and Woburn, as well as police K9 teams and a state helicopter, have been searching the Cabot Woods area of Newton, where Douglas was known to frequent.

'There have been other places we’ve looked at but not as intensively as this park and there was nothing (in other areas),' Newton police spokesman Lt. Bruce Apotheker said.

'They did an extensive search of the area, which came up negative.'

Douglas' brother yesterday posted a message to Reddit pleading for people not to judge his sister, who has suffered from bulimia and anorexia.

'She
 left her car at the Newtonville Shaws over the Pike and train station. 
She had $120 in her pocket. She is 5'11 and about 150 pounds (built like
 a supermodel and athletic),' he wrote.

'She has long brown hair and brown eyes and sometimes dresses like a hippie/hipster.

'Karen left a goodbye note to one of her best friends and has struggled with bulimia and depression in the past.

'I'm afraid it will be treated as 'some Newton brat ran away' when it's being treated as a very serious suicide attempt.'

He said his sister may have been spotted on Thursday at Harvard Square between 2pm and 4pm at a local Fedex store 'looking nervous'.

Newtown-North High School principal Jennifer Price sent an email  to parents and students on Thursday seeking their support.

'We are currently working with the police and her family to help locate Karen,' she wrote.

'We felt it was important to let you know given that this information is beginning to make its way into the press. At this time, the police are not treating this as a suspicious incident.'

Douglas is described as 5'11'' and has 
brown and brown eyes.

Police say she may be wearing a concert-type 
T-shirt, black yoga pants and a beige sweater.

Anyone with information on Douglas' whereabouts is encouraged to call Newton police at 617-796-2100.
