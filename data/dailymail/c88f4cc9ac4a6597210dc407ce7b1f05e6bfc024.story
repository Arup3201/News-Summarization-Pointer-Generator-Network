The parents of a seven-week-old baby girl have appeared in court charged with her murder.

Lee Davison, 28, and Jessica Hopkinson, 18, are accused of injuring Krystal Davison at their home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and both sobbed throughout the short hearing today.

Krystal was taken to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield last Thursday evening and police were called in after reports of a baby being brought in with serious injuries.

She died in the early hours of the next morning.

Today the pair spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth at Pontefract Magistrates Court.

Flanked by three security officers Davison, with short brown hair, jeans and a grey sweater crossed with thin blue lines, stood in front of Hopkinson, dressed in a bright pink top with black hair hanging down to her shoulders.

The pair were visibly upset during the short hearing, her wiping her eyes with a white tissue and him crying with his head on his arms, but they did not acknowledge each other in the dock.

They were both told that their case is to be sent to Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday.

No bail application was made.

The public gallery held around eight people, consisting of police and friends of the defendants.

It is understood the couple moved to their rented three-bedroom home in Pontefract in February.

A neighbour said the family had rushed to hospital on Thursday and police had been stood outside their semi-detached house ever since.

Keith Coverdale said he had seen little of the couple since they arrived in the street - and even less of their child.

Mr Coverdale, 28, said: 'The only clue I had that there was a young child in the house was the babygrows I would see hanging on their washing line.

'The only conversation I have had with them was on Tuesday night, when I took my dogs out for a walk,' he said.

'They were returning home with a baby in a pushchair and warned me to keep the dogs away from their gate.'

Paul Rothwell, 67, the owner of the property, said he understood the couple moved in before they had the baby.

He said the house is managed by a letting agency.

A spokesman for Wakefield Council confirmed the family was known to social services.

He added: 'It's obviously a really sad event but I cannot comment further in view of the police investigation.'
