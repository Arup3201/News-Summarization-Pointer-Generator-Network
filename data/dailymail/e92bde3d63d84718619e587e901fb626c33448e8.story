A police dog in Mississippi has been fired from the force, after finding playing with soda cans more interesting than drugs busts.

Police in Gulfport will be sending the Belgian Malinois dog back to the training facility he came from as Fred was found to be 'slacking off'.

Just two years ago, the city of Gulfport paid  $12,000-$13,000 for Fred which included training at a facility in Kaplan, Louisiana.

K-9 Fred gets easily abstracted on the job and starts playing with soda cans when he should be searching buildings and maintaining his focus

Fred was trained at K-9 Unlimited in Kaplan, a school thought to be excellent for turning out well-trained and hardworking dogs.

Chief Leonardo Papania told The Sun Herald that although Fred is more than capable of sniffing out drigs, he can sometimes get distracted.

He said that situations have come up where Fred will be searching a building, but see a soda can and start playing with it instead of finishing the job.

The police department tried sending Fred back to school to train the distraction out of him, but nothing seemed to work.

Fred (not pictured here) was trained at K-9 Unlimited, a very prestigious school in Kaplan, La.

The police were granted the right to sell back Fred to K9 Unlimited.

The police say they will miss the adorable yet distractible pooch.

'Your
 K-9 handlers do have a bond with these animals,' Papania said. 'They 
spend a lot of time with them. These animals are kept in their homes.

'You do have that working bond. But they also are aware of the ultimate 
responsibility we have with these animals.'
