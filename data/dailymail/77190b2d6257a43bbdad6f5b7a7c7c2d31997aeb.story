The mother of the Boston Marathon blast suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, says it is impossible that her two sons were responsible for the violent events this week and insists the brothers have been setup by the FBI.

Zubeidat Tsranaeva, who lives in Russia, said on Friday that her sons were innocent, while their father screamed and yelled in a separate interview in defense of the brothers.

'They never could have done this. Never, ever, ever!' said their father Anzor Tsamaev who lives in an area of Russia called Makhachkala.

He also said that he believes that his 
sons were set up, and without going into specifics, he said that if his 
younger son was killed once he is found, then he would see it as proof 
that there was a conspiracy afoot.

'If they killed him, then all hell would break loose,' he said to ABC News.

'If they kill my second child, I will know that it is an inside job, a hit job. The police are to blame.'

In a surprising twist, he said that he spoke to both of his sons just yesterday, days after the two bombs killed three and injured more than 180 people at the Boston marathon on Monday.

The boys told him: 'Everything is good, Daddy. Everything is very good.'

When asked what he would say to his 
living son, he said: 'Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead 
of you. Come home to Russia.'

The boys' mother, Zubeidat, echoed those sentiments, similarly accusing the FBI of setting up the boys in a Friday interview with RT America.

She said her older son, Tamerlan, became religious five years ago and claimed he had been spotted as a 'leader' in the movement and was being watched by the FBI.

'My two sons are really innocent and I know neither of them have never, never talked about what they're saying about them now,' she said.

Trying to understand: Anzor Tsarnaev said that he could not believe that his sons were behind the fatal bombing

In sync: Both Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife, Zubeidat, alluded to the existence of a conspiracy involving police or FBI meant to frame their innocent sons

Suspect: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, now 19-years-old, is seen in these two pictures that were released by authorities

Zubeidat described the boys as very communicative and said they called her often, telling her everything that was going on in their lives.

'I know my son never spoke about those things. I am a mother, I raised them.'

'My oldest son used to tell me everything. He used to call me and ask me "how are you mama?" Both of them, "mama we love you, mama how are you, we miss you."'

'My sons would tell me. My son would never keep it a secret. If there is anyone who would know, it would be me.'

The father has openly discussed the family's situation with the media.

'I feel terrible! Why they kill my son? Something wrong! My sons never do bombing. They hated guns – how they do bombs?' the boys father told People.

'I talked to my sons yesterday, both of them. We talked about the bombing. I was worried about them, they said they were okay.'

The first suspect- identified by 
officials as 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev- was shot and killed during a
 firefight with police but his younger brother Dzhokhar was able to 
escape and remains on the run.

He went on to say that they were good kids with 'big dreams'.

'I am very depressed. How am I going 
to live? Never I think in my mind this happen. My sons hate people who 
do bombs, they hate terrorists. Why they kill my son? And where is my 
other son? They have time to catch my other son, not kill,' he said.

'Deserved to die': An uncle of the first suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) said his nephew was a 'loser'. The second suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) remains on the run

Earlier on Friday, Anzor talked to the Associated Press, calling Dzhokhar 'a true angel'.

'Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.'

Back in the day: Dzhokhar's friends from high school paint a portrait of him being quiet but well-liked, one even saying that he was a 'class clown'

The siblings' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, gave an interview to the English-language Russian news channel RT America, insisting that her sons are '100 per cent innocent,' and that they have been framed.

'This is a set up, my son would never ever carry out such terror attack,' she said Friday.

She went on to say: 'FBI knew everything what my son was doing, told me he was serious leader, that they were afraid of him.'

Mrs Tsarnaeva went on to say that Dzhokhar was raised in the US and insisted that 'no one ever talked about terror' in their house.

That favorable picture of the 
19-year-old and 26-year-old bombing suspects comes in stark contrast to 
what one of their uncles recalled.

An uncle of the Boston bombing suspect who died early Friday morning said that he was a 'loser'.

Rather than being upset about his 
nephew's death, their uncle Ruslan Tsarni who lives in Maryland called 
Tamerlan a 'loser; and said that he 'deserved' his death this morning.

Initial
 reports say that he was strapped with an explosive when the shoot out 
began in the early hours of Friday morning, though it still remains 
unclear whether he died because the explosive or because of a gunshot.

He was declared dead within ten minutes of being taken to a local hospital.

'I wish they never existed,' Mr Tsarni, who lives in Maryland, told local Boston station WBZ.

Ruslan Tsarni said that the brothers had lived in America for nearly decade since traveling from Chechnya in Russia.

He
 had not spoken to the boys since 2009 and said that he did not 
recognize them when he saw the photos released by the FBI on Thursday 
evening.

'I'm wordless... shocked,' Mr Tsarni said.

'They do not deserve to exist on this earth.'

Ruslan called Tamerlan a 'loser', he described his younger nephew Dzhokhar as a quiet kid.

The boys' aunt, Maret, is a surgeon who 
lives in Canada. She used to be in Chechnya and her acts as a 
battlefield surgeon are described in a book.

'This is a huge tragedy for the family. My brother’s two boys, they are growing up so fast,' she told The Toronto Sun.

Unconvinced: Maret Tsarnaeva, the aunt of the two suspects, said that she could not believe the news

The devastation: Ms Tsarnaeva, who lives in Toronto, Canada, holds up a picture of the bombing

'My first reaction is, ‘Why the hell 
would they do this?’ But when I go through all the material, it’s not 
giving anything... the whole world is now making a decision (on them) 
now by just seeing these pictures and not having anything else.'

She told how her older brother Anzor had high expectations for his children, especially his older son Tamerlan.

Anzor was disappointed when he heard that Tamerlan, who was killed in a shoot out early Friday morning, had dropped out of college, but she thought that he had a happy life.

'Within the family, everything was perfect,' she said.

One hint of tension that she did reveal, however, was that Tamerlan 'seemingly did not find himself yet in America, because it's not easy.'

She said that the 26-year-old became a devout Muslim 'but just recently, maybe two years ago, he started praying five times a day.'

'He has a wife in Boston and from a Christian family, so you can't tie it to religion,' Maret told reporters.

The FBI has cordoned off the three-story brick building where the bombers' sister lives in West New York, near Union city in 
New Jersey. 

Unexpected: Friends and former classmates are painting a portrait of a normal young boy who went to parties and had friends

The New Jersey Star Ledger 
spoke to her earlier in the day and she said that she has not been in frequent contact with either of them.  

'They were great people. I never would have expected it. They are smart– I don’t know what’s gotten into them,' she said.

When
 asked if she was okay, she said: 'No I’m not okay– no one is okay right
 now. I’m hurt for everyone who has been hurt. I’m sorry for all the 
people who are hurt and for all the people who lost their lives.'

Several
 former classmates described Dzhokhar as a friendly, smart kid, and they
 said they were shocked that he was part of the pair who killed three 
and injured more than 180 in the marathon bombings on Monday.

An unidentified friend told CNN that he 'hung out, went to parties, smoked some weed... its not like he's some foreign dude'.

A different uncle, Alvi Tsarni, who lives close by in Boston was visibly upset when he spoke about his nephews.

'I don't believe any of my nephews are involved in this horrible incident,' Alvi Tsarni told the Boston CBS affiliate WBZ.

'If he did this I'm sorry too. It's crazy, it's not possible. I can't believe it. Who can do this stuff?'
