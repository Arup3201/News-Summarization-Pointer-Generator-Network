The promoter of the club where 12 Dallas Cowboys spent Friday evening before their fatal DUI accident had boasted on Twitter about their drinking exploits.

Kimesha Jackson, the promoter for the Dallas nightclub Privae, tweeted 'I have 12 Cowboys in the theeee building!!!!' Jackson added: 'These fools buying Ace on top of Ace!!!!'

'Ace' is thought to refer to Ace of Spades Champagne, a bottle which costs around $1,000 in a private club. Later that night linebacker Jerry Brown died in a drunk driving accident.

Drinking: Promoter Kimesha Jackson tweeted that 12 Dallas Cowboys were ordering $1000 a bottle Ace of Spades champagne the night that Brown died

According to USA Today, Brown and defensive tackle Josh Brent, were in Privae before leaving in Brent's car.

Brent was behind the wheel of a 2007 
Mercedes-Benz at about 2:20am on Saturday when the vehicle veered off 
the road, flipped at least once and slid about 900 feet.

Brent
has allegedly been speeding before the accident, which occurred hours 
before the team was due to fly to Cincinnati for Sunday's game against 
the Bengals.

NFL.com reported that the car was on fire when police arrived, and officers spotted Brent pulling Brown out of the mangled car.

Brown,
a practice-squad linebacker who also was Brent's teammate for three 
seasons at the University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the 
scene and pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

Privae is known for attracting 
celebrity clientele. Promoter Jackson posted a flyer for Friday's event 
on her Facebook which advertised "confirmed NFL/NBA friends."

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported
that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission would be investigating the
club.

In Texas, it is illegal to serve 
someone who intoxicated. The TABC said it would be interviewing other 
clubgoers, bartenders and any other witnesses.

Brent was released from jail on Sunday after posting bond for vehicular manslaughter.

As he stepped out of the Irving City Jail, Brent said he was 'just trying to deal' with the death of his teammate and 'very best friend' Brown.

'Jerry Brown was my very best friend, and I'm just trying to deal with his death right now,' Brent said, stopping briefly when asked if he had anything to say to Brown's family.

He would not answer any other questions.
