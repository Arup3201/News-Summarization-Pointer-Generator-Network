If the hot summer days have left your feet less than fresh a revolutionary Kickstarter project hopes to be the solution to all your problems.

Carbonised coffee fused into these futuristic socks promises to spell the end to stinky feet as it filters and adsorbs sweat and odour.

Ministry of Supply (MoS), who designed the garment, hope for £20,000 of funding but with more than two weeks to go until the opportunity to back them ends, they have already surpassed their goal four times over.

MoS' previous inventions include the £65 Apollo 2 dress shirt, a revolutionary garment that got widespread recognition.

The shirt is made using anti-microbial fabric with moisture wicking qualities and NASA heat-regulation technology.

The high-tech firm have now turned their hands to socks for their latest sartorial innovation.

Named Atlas,
the firm once again evoke ancient Greece for the name of their 
invention. The garment comes with a promise of cool and comfortable feet
thanks in part to coffee.

The
socks are made from a mix of cotton, recycled polyester and carbonised 
coffee which filters and absorbs sweat and odor to keep feet cool. MoS say that this is exactly how a Brita water filter works.

Carbonised coffee 'attracts molecules' 
(composed mostly of carbon) with its spongy structure. The trepped 
molecules are released in the wash, ready for a whole new dose of smells
the next time they're worn.

The high-tech socks are part of a Kickstarter project reliant on funding

The
coffee is reclaimed from coffee roasting factories and shops and then subjected 
to a pharmaceutical process to remove oils and that coffee 
smell. It is then 
infused into the company's recycled polyester yarns.

Atlas has undergone lab tests that 
MoS claims showed it to be three times more effective at absorbing 
smells than regular cotton.

The firm used 3D strain analysis to visualise how the skin stretches in 3D and adjusts, so that the sock doesn't have to bend and 
stretch to accommodate foot movements as conventional socks do.

They also used pressure mapping to 
locate points that require extra support, a similar to technology used
in the production of customised orthotics. This technique combined with thermal imaging 
identified hot spots and help improve ventilation.

They 'hope to provide new levels of comfort that were not previously possible'.

The firm say the socks are durable, easily passing the eight month stress-test.

Manufacturing
will be outsourced to specialist textile mills that use techniques such
as robotic knitting, which MoS says is like 3D printing but for 
knitwear.

MoS has poured as much clothing 
technology into ATLAS as it can, even down to the robotic knitting 
machines it uses to make the coffee socks.

Robotic knitting machines are like 3D printers for clothing, and offers the same level of precision and customisation industry 3D printers provide.

The sock project is now fully funded on Kickstarter four times over, so the MoS team's goal to product the garment in a variety of colours other than black is most likely to become a reality.

The  Atlas performance dress socks, a 'Brita filter for your feet', will come in medium and large and will cost £18 for two pairs. The project is still open for funding on Kickstarter for another 15 days.
