Key man: Aston Villa hope Cole will play a pivotal role this season

'One thing about Joe is he can see a pass, he can unlock defences with his ability. He's a top player and top man - we just have to keep him fit.

‘I have seen him in training and know exactly what he is capable of. Now we have to try to get the best out of him.

‘It is a bonus that he is back in the squad. He has been there and done it - he is a big asset to us.’
