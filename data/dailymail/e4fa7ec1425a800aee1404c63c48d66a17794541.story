It's difficult to imagine what a spectator at the first Wimbledon Championship in 1877 would make of the modern women's game.

They would certainly be surprised at the appearance and behaviour of the world's finest players yesterday.

Maria Sharapova showed she is not just good at tennis with a game of keepy-uppy during a training session.

While the training team had to do press-ups or a lap of the court if they let the ball drop, the 26-year-old Russian beauty avoided punishment

The former champion, 26, spent a 10-minute session with members of her training staff trying to keep a football in the air on Practice Court 16.

But while the others had to do press-ups 
or a lap of  the court as a forfeit for letting the ball drop, she 
avoided punishment for her errors.

Sharapova is due to play again today after breezing through her first-round match against Kristina Mladenovic on Monday, and is on course for a final with bitter rival Serena Williams.

Last year Bethanie Mattek-Sands dyed her locks green and purple – the colours of the All England Club.

Yesterday she turned up for her first round match with an even more alarming hair colour – bright green and yellow, outdazzling even the tournament’s fluorescent tennis balls. But it did not help the 28-year-old American, also known for her tattoos.

She lost to the seventh seed, Germany’s Angelique Kerber.

In a game that’s as much about mental strength as muscle power, players will do anything to give themselves an edge.

Yesterday,
that included having dripping blood and the cartoon caption ‘POW!’ 
painted on their nails – and pulling some rather terrifying faces.

Serena  Williams was sporting the intimidating nail designs, right, 
along with a striking up-do, centre.

And Slovakia’s Anna Schmiedlova, left, produced a very odd expression as she struggled in her match.
