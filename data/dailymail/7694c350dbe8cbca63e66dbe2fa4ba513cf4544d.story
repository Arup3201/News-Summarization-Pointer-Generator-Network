Sixty years after they went their separate ways in Ottowa, two childhood best friends will reunite back in Canada after it was revealed they were biological brothers all along.

Duncan Cumming, 72, and Ron Cole, 71, were close friends while attending the same grade school in the 1950s. They were raised by adoptive families in the same Ottowa neighborhood.

Fast-forward some 60 years to 2013 and the men--Cumming at his home on the island of Guernsey and Cole in Saskatchewan--were informed they shared a mother.

The way they were: Duncan Cumming, 72, and Ron Cole, 71, were close friends while attending the same grade school in the 1950s. Not until 2013 did they learn they are biological brothers

They men have since reconnected and have planned a reunion for next month, and its all thanks to a group called Parent Finders--but it nearly didn't happen.

'I was about to hang up, but she had a little too much information on my adopted family. She knew things that normally people wouldn’t know,' Cole recalled to the National Post about the phone call from Parent Finders.

It turned out, Cumming had reached out to the group in an effort to find his birth mother. Parent Finders then tracked down Cole.

'I started to listen. When she mentioned Duncan Cumming, that name kind of rang a bell,' Cole said.

The pair were friends for several years back in Ottowa. Their parents even vacationed once together and, by some incredible coincidence, they'd each saved the same black and white photo of the two of them aged 11 or 12 standing seaside. 

'It’s a great story,' Cole said.

Now the two men are planning a reunion in Ottowa, where they will meet as brothers for the first time, sixty years after parting as mere friends.
