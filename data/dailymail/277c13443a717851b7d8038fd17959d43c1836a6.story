Parties: Max Clifford, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, has admitted organising 'good honest filth' during the 1960s

Max Clifford threw 'legendary sex parties' where people would go for 'good honest filth', a court heard today.  

The PR guru was the 'ringmaster' at the events, but he insisted that he did not participate in the sex because he was in a relationship at the time. 

Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, Clifford angrily denied sleeping with Diana Ross as he called the sex abuse allegations against him 'a pack of lies'.  

The 70-year-old has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault against seven teenage girls, who claim he attacked them between 1966 and 1984.  

Today the court heard how Clifford had organised 'legendary sex parties' and 'blue movie' nights during the early 1960s, when he was working as a journalist.  

He also said he had 'thoroughly enjoyed' sex parties hosted by film star Diana Dors.  

Clifford described the parties as 'good honest filth for adults old enough to know what are doing, having a good time', and added: 'Sometimes when you are a star it's difficult to have the same kind of fun as other people.'  

But he denied taking part himself, saying: 'I was involved in organising good honest filth but that doesn't mean I had to stand there and take part. 

'I was with my partner, I was quite happy with that. Sometimes there was sex, sometimes there wasn't - to call them sex parties obviously sells.'  

He insisted he didn't personally call the parties 'legendary', adding: 'There are sex parties going on all over London all the time, that doesn't make them legendary'.  

When it was put to him that he was the 'ringmaster' of the sex parties, he replied: 'It's a role I like to have in many aspects of my life.'  

Clifford conceded he 'liked to be in control' but denied 'grooming' or 'manipulating beautiful and randy girls' for 'pleasure and a laugh'.  

Earlier he appeared agitated during cross-examination by prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC, and described his experience of being in court as 'horrible'.  

He told jurors: 'I have had heard more conversations about my penis in the last three weeks than I have in the last 70 years. It's all totally untrue'. 

Referring to claims he told a 17-year-old aspiring fashion model he slept with soul star Diana Ross, Clifford said: 'She actually said I claimed to have had sex with Diana Ross, nonsense.  

'Because I had a photograph of Diana Ross justifies her claiming that I had sex with Diana Ross. There is also a picture of Frank Sinatra - what are you suggesting, that I had sex with him as well?'  

He moaned about having to sit in the glass-enclosed dock 'for three weeks and listen to a pack of lies' while the prosecution presented its case to the jury.  

Evidence: Clifford was being cross-examined in court by prosecuting barrister Rosina Cottage QC

Anger: The veteran PR man described the allegations against him as 'a pack of lies'

Speaking about claim he abused a girl in a jacuzzi, the defendant said: 'I knew she was lying through her teeth. As far as I was concerned a liar is a liar is a liar.  

'She told a pack of lies then the next one went on to tell a pack of lies.'  

Clifford denied adopting voices including Bond supremo Cubby Broccoli, Hollywood heavyweight Aaron Spelling and Western star Charles Bronson to 'play games for his own sexual fun and pleasure'.

'These are all people that I would assume have very distinctive accents,' he said, insisting he only put on an effeminate voice to 'catch people out'.  

The court heard that Clifford had a string of affairs, but he denied the suggestion that he had told his daughter Louise to keep them secret from his wife.  

'Most of my friends were having affairs themselves', he said. 'My daughter knew and if she wanted to tell my wife, she could have done. She is very much her own person.  

'I would have said, "You know I love your mum and I would never leave her, but I'm greedy."'  

Accusation: Clifford is charged with 11 counts of indecent assault against seven girls and young women

When Ms Cottage suggested Louise had to lie for him to cover up his flings, he responded: 'She was a very responsible young lady but she didn't need to lie for me.  

'If she decided she wanted to tell my wife then she could have. I didn't say that makes it all right but that's what happened.'  

Ms Cottage told Clifford: 'You knew and always knew her loyalty would be with you.'  

He replied: 'No, that loyalty was to both of us. She was totally devoted to her mother as well.  

'It was the kind of relationship you have when you have been through all she had all these years. My daughter loved and trusted me and I loved and trusted her.  

'I'm very proud of my relationship with my daughter and proud of the woman she has become. I have never, ever expected her to lie.'  

Claim: He denied sleeping with soul singer Diana Ross, pictured in 2007 

Clifford suggested that his accusers had invented their stories in order to make money by exploiting his fame.  

'Because of who I am and where I am I have had calls from hundreds of people, both men and women, about stories they have fabricated,' he said.  

'When the Savile scandal broke we had dozens of people calling about stories, some of whom were obviously lying but some wanted money. It happens - it happens an awful lot.'  

Clifford dismissed suggestions he abused a 14-year-old he met at a Wimpy bar in 1966 - telling jurors he didn't like food from the burger joint.  

He also rebuffed the school girl's claims that the attack took place in a car - insisting he could not drive at the time.  

'It's absolute rubbish, a fairy story that only you believe', he told Ms Cottage.  

The lawyer said: 'You had only one thing on your mind, to have your sexual way with her, as you did again and again and again.'  

He replied: 'No, you are wrong, you are totally wrong. Why on earth would a girl get in a car with a total stranger that is repulsive and nerdy? It's totally ridiculous'.  

When it was suggested that Clifford's wife and mistresses would have been angry to discover him molesting young girls in his office, he replied: 'It didn't happen, so it wasn't a problem'.  

Clifford will continue giving evidence when the trial resumes on Monday.
