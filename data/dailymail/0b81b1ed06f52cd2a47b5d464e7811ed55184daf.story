A spurned teenager stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death with a six inch kitchen knife just hours after she begged police for help, a court heard.

Thomas Dalton, 19, is accused of waiting for Samantha Laney, 19, for 45 minutes outside her home before launching a vicious attack on her and her father.

Stafford Crown Court heard shortly after the killing Dalton updated his Facebook profile, saying: 'Some things got to be done in life.'

Murder charge: Thomas Dalton, 19, (left) is accused of stabbing Samantha Laney, 19, after lying in wait for 45 minutes outside her home before 
launching a vicious attack on her and her father

Miss Laney bled to death after a single stab wound to the back which punctured her lung and severed an artery.

Dalton is also accused of stabbing Miss Laney's father Steven Laney during the attack inside the family’s home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs., on February 21.

Mr Laney survived but the Court heard how just hours before her death, Miss Laney had called the police and asked them to help her after she received a string of violent threats from Dalton.

But officers refused to provide a police escort to accompany her to Dalton’s home to collect her belongings, saying they were too busy.

Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, told
the court Dalton had told Samantha he was going to 'slice her open' 
after she ended their relationship in January.

He
said Samantha had contacted Dalton to try and arrange for her or her 
dad to collect her personal items from his flat in Kidsgrove, Staffs.

The court heard he refused and threatened to kill her if she went near his home.

Mr Bennetts said: 'Samantha rang the police, asking for a police escort. She was told there were not enough police officers available.

'Samantha went to her aunt’s home. Dalton rang, ranting down the phone. He said if she or Steven went to their flat, he was going to slice them open.

'Steven entered Samantha’s house first, followed by Samantha and then her friend Elise. Elise attempted to close the door, but the door was flung open.

'Dalton, knife in hand, asked where Samantha was. Samantha was in the doorway between the kitchen and the hallway. Dalton ran up to her and stabbed her.

'Steven did not see the stabbing, but he saw Dalton with the knife. He ran up to him, and Dalton held the knife against him, trying to stab him.

'They struggled. During their struggle the knife fell to the floor.'

The
jury heard witnesses saw a man matching Dalton’s description standing 
near the address at 4.40pm, 45 minutes before Samantha arrived home.

The court was told Dalton then fled but was later arrested as he walked along the A34 towards his home in Kidsgrove.

Despite the efforts of paramedics, Samantha died shortly after 6pm.

Mr Bennetts said that while on remand, Dalton had written about the events of February 21, as part of a 'life story'.

The prosecutor claimed Dalton’s account confirmed he had intended to kill Samantha.

Dalton denies murder and attempted murder. The trial continues.
