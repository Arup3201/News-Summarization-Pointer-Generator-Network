Many great-grandmothers count knitting, watching television and completing crosswords among their hobbies.

But for Pat Thomson, 72, from Matlock, Derbyshire, everyday life is very different as Britain's oldest oil rig worker.

Instead, the pensioner battles 90mph gales, helicopter rides through lightning storms and 'bawdry' banter from male co-workers on a regular basis.

Ms Thomson, known as 'Auntie Pat' or 'The Queen' by her colleagues, gave up her job as a primary school teacher and joined a BP rig as a fully-qualified materials engineer in 1984.

She has spent the past 30 years working on rigs in far-flung locations, including the Falkland Islands, the North Sea and Gabon in Central Africa.

'I decided to leave teaching as I wanted 
to go on an adventure, and I have always loved science,' said the pensioner, who earns a hefty Â£700-a-day while offshore.

'Getting off helicopters 
on to the deck in 90 mile-an-hour winds is horrible as I am only little 
and I get blown around the place.

'The guys used to have to 
form a human chain and pass me up the steps, but over time, I have grown
 accustomed to flying by helicopter and now it's not as scary as it used
 to be.

'But there have been some particularly hairy moments, such as
 flying through a lightning storm, and on another flight back to 
Aberdeen many years ago, the pilot calmly informed us that one of the 
engines had failed and we were relying on just one.'

Ms Thomson, who has three children, also has
 to contend with the dangers of the rigs themselves, such as a 
potentially fatal hydrogen sulphide gas leak in the Irish sea.

'It would be common to hear the gas alarm going off regularly 
when working in the Irish sea as we were drilling alongside a live gas 
platform,' she said.

'When I realised I wasn't going to die, the first 
thing that came to mind was 'oh my god I look like such a state, I need 
to change and put on make-up before we get back to Aberdeen.'

The 5ft 3in pensioner said she had been forced to make herself 'one of the boys' to survive offshore during the early days of her career, claiming: 'The rigs were far from female-friendly'.

She said: 'I had no other female to share the experience with and 
ask for help. I had to share a cabin with four men, and use the same 
communal showers and toilets as them.

'On
 my first day on the rig, I arrived in the afternoon when most of the 
men were asleep after doing a 12-hour night shift.

'The
 last thing these guys expected was to see a woman arrive on the rig and
 that was certainly made clear when a man walked past me naked on the 
way to the showers.

'Another
 time, I was sharing a cabin with a young guy who was quite shy about 
being in the same room as a woman. He was worried as he had not brought 
any pyjamas, but I assured him it was OK as I had brought two nighties 
with me. I have never seen someone go so red in my life.'

Carrying on: Ms Thomson said she believed her unusual career had 'saved her' after her partner Russell died from prostate cancer in 2010

She added: 'I had to adapt myself to working like a man. I didn't wear low cut tops or lots of make-up.

'I tried not to complain and I got my hands dirty, I didn't want to be seen as some little woman who needed special treatment.

'I
 would have to get a steward to check if the communal toilets were empty
 before I went in and I'd leave a pink towel over the door so that the 
guys knew not to come in, or come in at their peril.

'My handiest qualification for dealing with the rig crew proved to be primary teaching.'

Ms Thomson, who starred in the 1994 documentary 'The Black Island', which explored life 
on-board North Sea oil rig F.G. McClintock, said she believed her unusual career had 'saved her' following her partner 
Russell's death from prostate cancer in 2010.

'Being 
offshore was a great way to take my mind off Russell,' she said. 'It really helped 
me move on.

'If not, I would have been sitting around in my slippers 
feeling sorry for myself. And I love challenges, so that is why I haven't
 packed it in yet.'

Ms Thomson recently completed a job in Gabon, where she was in charge of a team of men - many of whom had 
never had a female boss, let alone a woman of 72.

And her new partner, 79-year-old Robert Wood, could not be prouder of her achievements:

'I think it is fantastic all that she has done,' he said. 'You don't meet 
many women who can say they have worked offshore, I am very proud of 
her.'
