Britain is 'breaching the human rights' of controversial Wikileaks founder Julian Assange by not allowing him to leave his embassy hideout to go sunbathing, it's been claimed

Britain is 'breaching the human rights' of controversial Wikileaks founder Julian Assange by not allowing him to leave his embassy hideout to go sunbathing, Ecuador's foreign minister has today claimed.

The south American country claims the fugitive's human rights are being trampled on by being prevented from enjoying London's summer sunshine.

Assange, 41, has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in Kensington, west London, for nearly a year.

He was granted asylum as he fights extradition to Sweden on sex assault charges.

Met Police keep a 24-hour watch on the building and have orders to arrest him if he steps outside of the building.

Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino insisted today ahead of a meeting next Monday with William Hague in London his country would continue to protect Assange.Â 

Insisting the Australian could only sunbathe through the window of his embassy hideout, he said: 'We believe he has a fundamental right to sunbathe.'

He added: 'His right to intimacy, mobility, a normal life and health is being restricted.

'I will be asking the British government to allow Mr Assange to sunbathe and enjoy the warm weather and sunshine because unfortunately, at this moment in time, he hasn't been able to do so for a year.'

Assange was given diplomatic asylum two months after seeking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy on June 19 last year.

He entered the embassy after the UK's Supreme Court dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition to Sweden over claims by two female Wikileaks supporters he committed sex offences against them.

The Wikileaks founder says he fears he will be handed over to the US and face the death penalty if he is sent to Sweden.

Ecuador's Foreign Minister is expected to tell Britain it has a duty to grant Assange a safe passage out of the UK during his trip next week.
