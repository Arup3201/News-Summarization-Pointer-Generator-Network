A woman terrified of being an overweight bride refused to set a date for her wedding until she managed to slim down.

Kirsty Thomson, 26, from of Callander, Stirlingshire, weighed nearly 17 stone when she got engaged to sweetheart Lindsay McEwan.

She accepted and the couple got engaged - but loathed the idea of being what she called a 'fat bride'.  Instead, Kirsty kept her fiance waiting for seven years until she was slim enough to fit into her dream dress.

It took countless diets and Lindsay annually proposing to her again, asking if she was ready to tie the knot, before Kirsty finally reached her target weight.

Now Kirsty has finally glided down the aisle to wed her beau weighing a healthy 11st 9lbs after shrinking from a size 22 to a size 10.

She said: 'I refused to set a date because I didn't want to be a fat bride.

'I tried every diet but I would always start craving something and that would be the end of it.

'Lindsay has been patient and kept asking me on the same date for seven years. He's been great and very supportive.'

Kirsty struggled with her weight while working as a waitress at a hotel - where Lindsay was head waiter - because food was always available in the staff accommodation.

She later left the hotel and started working for a pharmacy, where one of her jobs was to offer advice on leading a healthy lifestyle.

It took seven years, lots of different diets and annual repetition of proposals before they married

Kirsty said: 'Lindsay and I both worked in the hotel and our shifts were all over the place so we never really had the chance to cook.

'We were surrounded by a fish and chip shop, Chinese and Indian takeaways, so we just ate conveniently. It was all the wrong stuff.

'Being a waitress was an active job. I could do it but I ended up a sweaty mess and you don't want somebody like that serving your dinner.

'I've worked in a pharmacy for the past three and a half years and I have to promote healthy eating.'I was massively obese and I was suppose to give advice about that. I felt like such a hypocrite.

'Some of my friends went to dance classes but I couldn't go - even if I could do the moves, I couldn't wear the outfits. It was mortifying.

'I didn't do much sport or exercise before. I hated going clothes shopping because there was only a few clothes shops in my town that had sizes big enough to fit me.

'I couldn't go shopping with my friends because I found it embarrassing but now I can swap clothes with them.'

As a result of her dodgy diet Kirsty ballooned to a weight of 16st 9lbs. 

But a year after joining Scottish Slimmers she began shopping for her wedding dress and could even swap outfits with her three best friends who became her bridesmaids.

Kirsty reached her target weight of 11st 9lbs just two weeks before her big day and even had to have her dress altered - because she was still losing weight.

She said: 'It was perfect timing.

'I ordered my dress from an American company in April and when it arrived in June it fitted perfectly.

'But when I tried it on two weeks before the wedding it didn't fit. I had to have four inches taken in because the weight just kept falling off.

'It was so easy. The more weight I lost the more interested I became.'

Kirsty soaked up the compliments from family and friends on her big day at Doune Castle, Perthshire, where she finally married Lindsay last month.

Guests were treated to a slap-up meal of prawns, salmon, chicken and cheesecake.

The happy couple then jetted off on a romantic honeymoon to Malta and the newly-wed bride packed a bikini in her suitcase for the first time.

Kirsty said: 'The honeymoon was phenomenal. All my clothes were either size 10 or size 12 and I bought my first ever bikini which I wore proudly.

'In the past I sometimes needed a seatbelt extension on the plane because it either wouldn't fasten or it would dig into me.

'Sometimes I would be too embarrassed to ask for it and just suffered the pain. I didn't have that problem this time.'

Proud husband Lindsay added: 'Kirsty's transformation is fantastic, she's looking good.

'I asked her every year to set a date but she would always just say 'not this year'.

'I managed to stay patient because I love her and she was definitely worth the wait.

'The wedding was great and Kirsty looked fantastic in her wedding dress.'
