David Cameron came to the defence of Bomber Command last night, calling them ‘heroes of our country’ who played a vital role in defeating Hitler.

The Prime Minister launched an impassioned defence of the sacrifice of the RAF in what was seen as a public slap down of the Archbishop of Canterbury over his apology for the bombing of Dresden.

Mr Cameron made his remarks to hundreds of dock workers at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk, and prompted an immediate round of applause.

Impassioned: The Prime Minister (left) launched a defence of the sacrifice of the RAF in what was seen as a public slap down of the Archbishop of Canterbury (right) over his apology for the bombing of Dresden

Last week the Mail reported how Archbishop Welby had spoken of his ‘profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow’ over the bombing of Dresden on the 70th anniversary of the raids.

Since the Mail published the story, we have been deluged with letters from readers deploring his comments, including from members of Bomber Command and relatives of those who gave their lives to defeat the Nazis.

Asked yesterday if he agreed with the Archbishop, Mr Cameron made clear his strong feelings of gratitude for the role of air personnel during the Second World War.

They were, he said, ‘very brave people who took enormous risks with incredible loss of life on our behalf to save Europe, to save Britain from fascism, from Hitler’.

He said: ‘Bomber Command played an absolutely vital role in our war effort. One of the things I was very proud to do as Prime Minister was to make sure the people who served in Bomber Command got proper recognition with a new clasp on their medals.

Allied bombing raids on Dresden left 25,000 civilians dead in 1945 and razed much of the city to the ground

‘And it was a great honour to hand out some of those medals to people who have waited for many, many years for the recognition I think they deserve.

‘I’m very lucky to occasionally get to jog around St James’s Park in London, and I always stop and look up at the Bomber Command memorial and think about those very brave people.

‘To me the people who served in Bomber Command are heroes of our country and they played a very important role in the Second World War.’

The Prime Minister was in Felixstowe to speak about his plans to improve the economy of the region.

Archbishop Welby spoke of his feelings about the Dresden raids – which left 25,000 civilians dead and reduced much of the city to rubble in 1945 – at a church service attended by German President Joachim Gauck.

He said: ‘Whatever the arguments, events here 70 years ago left a deep wound and diminished all our humanity. So as a follower of Jesus, I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow.’

His address made no reference to more than 55,000 British aircrew killed in the war against Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London and Coventry.

Later he was asked in a BBC interview if he thought Britain and America should apologise and said it was a ‘very complicated question’ – noting that British civilians had suffered during the Blitz and other German bombings.

He said: ‘I think there is a deep need for profound sorrow at the events and the causes of such dreadful times as Europe lived through.’

Archbishop Welby’s spokesman later attempted to clarify the remarks, claiming that it was ‘manifestly false’ to suggest he was apologising.
