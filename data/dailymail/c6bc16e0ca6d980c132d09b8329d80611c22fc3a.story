A reckless 19-year-old landed himself in a Florida hospital last
night after attempting to jump over a moving car driven by his younger brother.

Local police say Bladimir Barreto was attempting the
audacious leap for a video to display his athletic abilities to college football
recruiters.

As shown in the video below, an accelerating Honda Accord collided with
the shirtless Barreto head on before he was able to get off the ground. The collision
sent Barreto flying over the car and spinning several times in mid-air before hitting
the ground. The video was taken by another brother and uploaded to the
Internet.

Florida Today reported that Barreto was conscious and
bleeding when he was airlifted and flown from Palm Bay to Holmes Regional Medical Center in
Melbourne at about 5.30pm.

A Palm Bay police spokeswoman said Barreto is lucky that his
injuries weren't worse. She said the aspiring athlete was likely trying to
simulate videos he saw on the Internet.

Barreto graduated from West Melbourne Christian Academy in
2010 and played for the now defunct Brevard Grizzlies, an amateur football team.

"He wanted to play football and move on, he's just undersized. He's a small guy that was blessed with speed," Barretoâ€™s former Grizzlies coach David Dye told Florida Today. Dye said he estimated Barreto to be about 5 ft 5 in.

Police said charges are pending against Jerome Barreto, 17, who
was driving without a license.
