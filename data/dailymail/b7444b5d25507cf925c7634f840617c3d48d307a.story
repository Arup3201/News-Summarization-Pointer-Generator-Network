A Florida woman returned home this week to discover a baby who had been left on her doorstep - but local officials insist it was all a big misunderstanding.

The little boy was strapped into his car seat that was placed just outside Lynn Cattanio's Naples home.

Inside a diaper bag left nearby the 39-year-old woman found a note supposedly written by the infant's mother.

Confusing situation: This infant boy was found on the doorstep of a home in Naples, Florida, Tuesday morning, but authorities claim he was not, in fact, abandoned

‘[It] said that we looked like a loving family,’ she told the station WBBH.

The Collier County Sherriff’s Office had initially launched an investigation into allegations that someone was possibly trying to sell the newborn before dropping him off on Cattanio's doorstep.

The claims, however, later proved to be unfounded, leading the agency to conclude the probe.

The Naples resident, who operates a local candle shop, recalled a bizarre encounter that happened over the weekend - just days before the shocking discovery.

‘This lady walks by with a little white Maltese. All of a sudden, within 10 minutes, we knew her life story,’ Miss Cattanio said.

The woman said that the stranger allegedly mentioned that she had a daughter who recently had a baby, but refused to care for it and wanted to sell it for $10,000. 

After coming upon the baby boy outside her home Tuesday morning, Cattanio went over to a nearby motel where she believed the infant's family were staying, but they were nowhere to be found. 

Misunderstanding: A sheriff's office spokesperson suggested that Cattanio may have misread the situation, mistakenly believing the the child had been abandoned

The following day, the owner of the Naples inn confirmed that a family matching Cattanio's description had been renting a room there for a week.

‘[The family] didn't alarm us, but seems like she had some kind of issue,’ the motel proprietor said. Sometimes we see they all are arguing.’

In a bizarre twist, Cattanio said that after she called the authorities to report that someone had left a baby on her doorstep, the infant's grandmother suddenly showed up at her home and took the child back.

But as soon as the unnamed woman got into her car and started pulling out, she was surrounded by a dozen sheriff's deputies.

Friday morning, however, a spokesperson for the Collier County Sheriff's Office told MailOnline that it all has been a misunderstanding, and that the case had been closed.

Public information officer Michelle Batten said that the boy had not, in fact, been abandoned, but declined to provide additional details on the case.

According to Miss Batten, the child has since been reunited with his family.
