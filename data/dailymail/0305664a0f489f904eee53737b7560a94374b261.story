Christmas is seen by most families as a time to celebrate together – but for some it seems that only holds true until there is a better offer.

The majority of workers would choose a small cash bonus over a couple of extra days off with their loved ones during the festive period, according to research.

Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers asked 2,400 adults what they would value most at Christmas. The most popular option was a £250 cash bonus, with 57 per cent of the vote.

Just one in ten people opted for two extra days of annual leave.

The same proportion chose a £250 voucher from their favourite shop.

Only 4 per cent would take the offer of a £10,000 bar tab for their closest ten colleagues, 5 per cent would prefer a tablet computer and 4 per cent opted for a Christmas hamper worth £250.

Despite Christmas traditionally being a time of giving, only 2 per cent picked the generous option of donating £250 to charity.

A further 2 per cent chose a free dinner and drinks for them and three others. 

Experts offered a charitable explanation for the findings. 

They argued that the results show many people are struggling financially this Christmas – rather than wanting to escape their in-laws.

John Harding, employment partner at PwC, said: ‘Despite the recent signs of a pick-up in wage growth, many people are still feeling the squeeze so it isn’t surprising that people are hoping for an extra cash bonus in their stocking this year.’

He added: ‘Our research highlights that cash is still king this Christmas as employees overwhelmingly place a higher value on a small amount of extra pay above all benefits – even extra time off with their families at Christmas.’

Workers have endured an unprecedented squeeze on finances triggered by the economic crisis, as wage rises failed to keep pace with inflation.

But there are signs this could be coming to an end. 

Official figures released last week show regular pay grew 1.6 per cent in the year to October, while inflation fell to 1 per cent – its lowest level for 12 years.

Senior City workers can afford to splash out this Christmas as they look forward to average bonuses of £124,680. 

Their windfalls are predicted to rise by more than a fifth on last year’s average of £102,940, despite pressure from regulators. It means the typical bonus will be more than four times the average UK salary, according to recruitment firm Astbury Marsden.
