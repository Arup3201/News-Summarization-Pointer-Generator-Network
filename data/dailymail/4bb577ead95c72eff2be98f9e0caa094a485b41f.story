A bridesmaid hanged herself just hours after her sister's wedding, an inquest has heard.

Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year.

Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding.

But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party.

Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer.

Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. 

Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.

Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.'

Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fiancé Matt Wilson.

'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' 

Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. 

Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk.

Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight.

Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. 

Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey.

Carlo Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer

She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy.

'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.'

However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.'

The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels.

Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening.

Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems.

Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist.

He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.'

She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.'

'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added.

Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things.

Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding.

Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her.

However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. 

The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011.

Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems.

Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' 

Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.'

'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said.

'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work.

'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with.

'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died.

'On the 8th of November 2013 Boo's sister was married. Boo had played a major role in planning the hen do, which albeit stressful, seems to have gone very well.

'I heard that during the course of the wedding in the main Boo was her usual bubbly, lively self and that she, as her father told me, had been the 'life and soul of the party.'

'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.'

He ruled out a verdict of suicide, as he could not find any clear intention, such as leaving a suicide note and Rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days.

'Consequently I conclude Rebecca died from self-inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear,' he said.
