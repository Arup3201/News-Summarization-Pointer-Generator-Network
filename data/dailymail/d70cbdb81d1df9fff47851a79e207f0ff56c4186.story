A sports reporter got a little too close to the action at a high school football game earlier this month and ended up getting trampled by virtually an entire team.

On the opening weekend of the Texas football playoffs, David Amador traveled to Harlingen to cover their game against McAllen Memorial on November 16.

Amador’s video footage shows him filming the pre-game spectacle which involved the Harlingen players entering a giant Cardinals helmet, as smoke was set off inside of it.

In his desire to get as close to the act as possible, Amador stands less than 10 feet away from the players.

Next they start to run out of the helmet, which should be the reporter’s cue to get out of the way.

Instead, Amador stands his ground and it isn’t long before he is soon knocked to the ground by the stream of college footballers.

Oddly, Amador doesn’t seem to mind be roughed up by the players and can even be hear laughing during his ordeal.

By the end of the video, Amador is flat on his back while he continues to film what is going on around him - only now he is upside down.

'I got knocked down but that's okay its football time!,' yells an exhilarated Amador, who doesn't seem to have sustained any lasting injuries.

Harlingen topped Memorial, 58-20, so maybe the Cardinals should keep Amador around.

He publishes High School Sports Magazine, a Texas production that covers high school sports across the state, reports The Big Lead.
