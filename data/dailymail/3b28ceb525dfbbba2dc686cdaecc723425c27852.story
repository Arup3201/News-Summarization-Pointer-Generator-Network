Anti-terror police in Germany have arrested a  man codenamed 'The Tailor' who they claim ran a secret textile factory supplying large amounts of clothes and boots for ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria.

The Lebanese man, identified only as 31-year-old Kassem R., was woken up at his home in a suburb of Bonn by GSG-9 officers blowing off the front door of his apartment with explosives.

Similar raids at other addresses in Germany on Saturday resulted in more arrests of ISIS sympathisers.

He was led away for questioning along with his wife and children.

Computers, mobile phones and paperwork were seized by officers who suspect him of supplying ISIS terrorists with combat suits, 7,500 pairs of boots, 6,000 military-issue parkas and 100 military shirts - in all worth £100,000 - from a secret plant inside Germany.

Fifteen people were held in other raids in Germany as the intelligence service attempts to dismantle the support system underwriting the killers on the ground in the Middle East.

A 38-year-old Tunisian called Kamel Ben Yahia S. is accused of also sending clothing and cash to ISIS while Yusup G., 28, a Russian, was identified as the quartermaster responsible for shipping the goods.

Germany has seen some 400 of its citizens leave to fight for the jihad in Syria and Iraq in recent years. Spy chiefs say that a well-structured support system in the country is helping them with materials and goods to continue fighting.

Meanwhile Turkey said it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to reinforce fellow Kurds in the Syrian town of Kobani, while the United States air-dropped arms for the first time to help the defenders resist an Islamic State assault.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington had asked Ankara to let Iraqi Kurds cross its territory so that they could help defend the town which lies on the Turkish frontier, adding that he hoped the Kurds would 'take this fight on'.

Kurdish militias in Kobane have been fighting off an Islamic State offensive since September without, until now, outside help apart from U.S.-led airstrikes on the jihadists. 

The town, which is besieged by Islamic State on three sides, lies on the frontline of the battle to foil the radical group's attempt to reshape the Middle East.

The U.S. Central Command said it had delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to allow the Kurdish fighters to keep up their resistance in the town which is called Kobani in Kurdish and Ayn al-Arab in Arabic.

The main Syrian Kurdish armed group, the YPG, said it had received 'a large quantity' of ammunition and weapons.

The Islamic State relies on its global online propaganda machine, run largely by supporters far from the battle, to entice fighters, funding and other aid to the front. 

If the militants' victories begin to ebb in such a public forum, U.S. officials believe, so too will their lines of support. That alone makes the battle for Kobani a must-win fight for the U.S. strategy.
