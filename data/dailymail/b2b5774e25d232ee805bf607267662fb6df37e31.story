2013 has been a great year for Apple after it hit 50 million app downloads in May, and the best selling app of the lot was Minecraft.

The building app, which has become a phenomenon with children across the UK, was the most popular paid-for app on iTunes for both iPhones and iPads over the past 12 months, according to Apple’s annual sales round-up.

Candy Crush Saga topped the list of free apps on both devices during 2013 and Skyfall was crowned the bestselling film of the year.

Apple has unveiled its annual iTunes round-up of the bestselling games, apps, TV shows, films and music of the past year. Minecraft Pocket Edition, pictured, was the most popular paid-for game on iPhone and iPad

The Minecraft app, created by developer Mojang, is called Pocket Edition because it is a scaled down version of the popular PC and Xbox game.

It includes Survival and Creative modes and users can compete and play with other iPhone and iPad players over a local Wi-Fi network.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Snapchat, headquarters pictured, was the second most popular free app in 2013. The two-year-old app was recently rumoured to have refused a $3million buyout from Facebook

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials.

The app costs £4.99 but once a player pays, they can use the same game across multiple devices.

Sweet-swapping game Candy Crush Saga, pictured, was the most popular free app on both iPhones and iPads during 2013

Candy Crush Saga, in which players switch sweets to create lines of three or more to make them disappear, is free but players only get five lives at a time.

To unlock more lives, they must either wait half an hour for each life to refresh, ask Facebook friends for lives, or pay 69p through the App Store.

The app is also available through Facebook and developer King has today released a Dreamworld expansion pack for the popular game.

The language-learning aid Duolingo was chosen by a panel of judges as the iPhone app of the year, while Disney Animated, which allows users to learn the secrets of creating cartoons and bringing illustrations to life, has been named as the iPad app of the year.

The round-up also looked at the bestselling TV shows, movies and music.

Emmy award-winning show Breaking Bad, which concluded its fifth and final series earlier this year, was the most popular TV series of 2013.

Sam Mendes’ James Bond thriller Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig was the bestselling film.

Now That’s What I Call Music! 85 was the number one selling album on iTunes of 2013 and Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines featuring T.I and Pharrell was the number one selling song.

Beyonce’s recent surprise fifth album smashed iTunes records last week by selling 828,773 copies in just three days, yet has not been on sale long enough to make the list.

Channel 4 political drama Homeland took the top two spots in the bestselling TV shows of the year.

The full list of winners and editor choices is available at the iTunes store.
