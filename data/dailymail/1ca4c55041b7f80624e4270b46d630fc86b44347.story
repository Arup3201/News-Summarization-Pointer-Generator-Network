Most staff expect to answer a few probing questions from their employers when they have been off sick for a while.

But council workers in the Swedish city of Umeå were outraged after being quizzed about their sex lives, drinking habits and even their bowel movements when they returned to work from illness.

They were told to answer the bizarre questions in order to be allowed to return to their old jobs.

One woman claims she lost her job as a cook after refusing to answer the questions, according to reports in Sweden.

Several teachers were also apparently told to take the test.

One told the Kommunalarbetaren newspaper that she was asked about her 'sex-life, excrement, 
how much alcohol I drank even though I’d previously answered that I was 
practically a teetotaler.'

Umeå council has announced it has now stopped the 70-question test which was developed by the firm Personnel Partner AB, according to the newspaper.

Speaking to Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper, Gunnar Sjölander of the Swedish Teachers' Union (Lärarförbundet) explained that the test was 'mandatory.'

He said that several teachers who took it were then told they had two weeks to find a new job or 'face redundancy.'

'If they didn't find one, they were out. And some have already left,' he told the newspaper.

Umeå municipality's human resources director Birgitta Forsberg is reported to have said that around ten people were 'reassigned' after taking the test.

Umeå municipality and Personnel Partner AB were reported to the Swedish Data Inspection Board following the allegations, according to the Swedish English language news website, The Local.

The council has announced it has cut ties with the firm and that it will hold discussions with the people who have taken the test, according to reports.

Anders Lilliesköld, the council's personnel officer told the  Kommunalarbetaren that the test was used alongside 'many different activities' to determine whether a staff member could return to work.
