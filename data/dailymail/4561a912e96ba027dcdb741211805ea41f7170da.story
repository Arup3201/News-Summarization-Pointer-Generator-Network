'H8GAYS.'

It's the last thing you'd expect to see while walking through an airport and glancing down at your boarding pass.

Indeed the one worse configuration you might see on a plane ticket would be 'LST-UR-LUGGAGE'.

But according to Jeff White, a student at the University of West Florida, the confirmation code printed on a boarding pass issued to him by Delta Air Lines read as the anti-gay slur 'H8GAYS'.

'At first I didn’t think I read it right,' White told The Washington Post.

'I was worried that another customer might think I somehow picked that code.

'If I were a gay male, I might have thought that a Delta worker purposely gave me that code, and that would have made me extremely uncomfortable.'

The error occurred on a flight to Pensacola, Florida, earlier this month.

While the pass appears to be a genuine mistake, the lettering raised eyebrows because of its likeness to that of the NO H8, an American charity set up to promote equality, specifically to endorse same-sex marriage.

Delta Air Lines apologized for any 'concern or misunderstanding' the error occurred, but insisted that the confirmation codes 'are computer-generated and are completely random'.

'We will make every effort to ensure that a similar combination does not occur in the future,' added Russell Cason, a spokesman for the airline.

However the mistake has raised questions on why the combinations 'GAY' and 'H8' weren't previously blocked from Delta's system.

White, an IT major, said that Delta has surely blocked other letter combinations and could have done so with these words/expressions.

'What surprises me is that they didn’t block [the confirmation code] as a possibility of the string of random numbers and letters in the software they use to generate the code', he said.

'I’m sure they removed many four-letter words that would be seen as offensive.

'I’m surprised that ‘gays’ and ‘H8’ weren’t blocked as well.'

The situation is reminiscent of a incident in September, when Blake Loates, of Edmonton, Canada, opened a bottle of Vitamin Water and found 'You Retard' written on the inside of the lid.

Coca-Cola apologized to the family of an Alberta woman who was shocked to unscrew a bottle of the companys Vitamin Water and find the words 'YOU RETARD' printed inside the cap.

To make matters worse, Loates has a daughter with Autism and Cerebral Palsy.

Vitamin Water's parent company, Coca Cola, apologized, saying that retard in French is 'slow down' and that was what the bottle was supposed to mean.

In a separate incident earlier this year, Jetstar, the low-cost Australian airline, issued an apology to a passenger who pulled his suitcase from a baggage carousel at Perth Airport to find the message 'I am gay' written on it with stickers.

The man, a father of two, wrote about the incident in a blog, and said that his suitcase had been the first to appear on the carousel.

Budget Australian airline Jetstar launched an investigation into an incident which occurred at Perth Airport wherein a passenger retrieved his bag from the carousel only to find it had 'I AM GAY' written across it in stickers

He said he was 'utterly disgusted' and saw the eyes of fellow passengers 'look him up and down'.

'I was taken aback by the slogan but thought I had thick enough skin to ignore the leering,' he added.
