More than 20,000 homes and at least five schools were evacuated after a raging wildfire caused by months of drought spread across 700 acres of land in San Diego, California.

Firefighters worked around the clock as the fast-moving flames - dubbed the Bernardo Fire - ripped through parched land in the Rancho Bernardo area, pushed along by fierce winds. 

Helicopters could also be seen flying overhead spraying water onto the flames, as black smoke and whirling ash billowed into the sky above.

More than 20,000 homes were evacuated in San Diego, California after months of drought caused a raging wildfire to spread across 700 acres of land

Firefighters worked around the clock to tackle the flames, which come after months of drought and some of the highest temperatures recorded in the area for more than 30 years

The blaze began in the Rancho Bernardo area and was spread along the parched ground by the gusty Santa Ana winds

Officials said no homes were reported damaged in the fire. But there are still fears of more wildfires spreading across California as more record-high temperatures are predicted over the next two days

San Diego fire chief Javier Mainar said the firefighters now had a 'pretty good handle' on the wildfire

The wildfire comes after months of drought, as well as some of the highest temperatures seen in the area for more than 30 years.

On Tuesday, the day the fire started, record temperatures of 94F - which is around 35C - were recorded for the first time since 1979.

As the fire took hold of the area, evacuation orders were made for more than 20,000 homes, as well as several schools, on the outskirts of San Diego.

Meanwhile, another 1,200 homes and business in Santa Barbara County - which is 250 miles to the north - were also evacuated due to a fire, which spread across 500 acres.

Daniel Berland, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said at least six other fires in total had been reported in the state, but they were all now believed to be under control.

Another fire in southern San Diego County destroyed a mobile home before it was put out, he said.

On Tuesday, temperatures peaked at 94F, which is around 35C - the highest recorded temperature for this time of year in the area since 1979

While residents began returning to their homes last night, officials said no homes were reported damaged in the fire.

But there are fears there could be more fires, as record-high temperatures are predicted across California for the next two days.

Los
 Angeles and neighbouring cities have even introduced parking restrictions in
 some areas to make sure emergency vehicles can get through if fires 
start.

San Diego Fire Chief Javier Mainar said: 'At the point the fire is right now, we believe we have a pretty good handle on it.

'We hope to do some more work through the night and into tomorrow, but I think the largest part of the emergency has passed.'

But the fires still caused widespread panic for residents around the area.

Cameron Stout said he got a text from his wife shortly after midday, while he was filling up his car with petrol, saying she was packing up and leaving the family home with their valuables. 

Their next-door neighbor's home burned in a fire 15 years ago, he said.

The combination of high temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds caused the wildfire to spread

This week, San Diego recorded its highest temperature since 1979. There has also been less than half the average annual rainfall so far this year

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has responded to 1,350 fires since January 1, compared with an average of 700 by this time of year

Resident Chuck Dawson said about 30 firefighters barricaded his home after flames came within 25ft of the property

He said: 'This area's been through 
this before. I thought the recent rains would have prevented this from 
happening. But after a couple days of 100 degrees, it's reversed all 
that.'

Katy Ghasemi, 14, was
 held for hours in her high school classroom before the school let the 
children go home.

She said students studied, ate lunch, did yoga and looked out of the windows as the fire spread outside.

She said: 'There were a lot of flames. Some were right near the front gate.'

Resident Chuck Dawson said firefighters saved his home.

He said: 'The heat is ferocious as you get close to it. In fact, it probably came within 25ft of our house.

'Luckily, we had about 30 firemen who barricaded it, and it burned all the way around, but we're safe.'

The wildfire was caused by a combination of high heat, low humidity and notoriously gusty Santa Ana winds.

Months
 of drought have also left much of the landscape ready to burn.

Los 
Angeles has recorded just 6inches of rain this year - less than half its annual average rainfall.

Mr Berlant said: 'Fire season last year never really ended in Southern California.'

He said his agency has responded to more than 1,350 fires since January 1, compared with an average of 700 by this time of year.
