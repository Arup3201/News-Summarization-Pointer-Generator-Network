Fiery crash: This image shared by Twitter user Andrew Clifford depicts what appears to be a Lamborghini Diablo on fire after a collision near George Washington Bridge

Authorities in New York and New Jersey are trying to solve the mystery of a crashed Lamborghini that was found burning and abandoned near the George Washington Bridge.

Port Authority Police Spokesman Joe Pentangelo says the high-end Lamborghini Diablo was discovered engulfed in flames and unoccupied in the westbound lanes near the bridge toll plaza in Fort Lee, New Jersey, early Monday.

The luxury sports vehicle showed signs of a collision and sustained extensive fire damage.

Lamborghini Diablos were made by the Italian sports car company from 1990 to 2001. They are typically valued at $150,000 to $200,000.

The scorched Lamborghini was impounded after the fire was put out by responding police officers.

So far, officials have more questions than answers about the fiery accident.

Pentangelo told NorthJersey.com they do not know where the crash involving the Lamborghini took place.

The high-performance car was spotted on fire at around 2am Monday near Bridge Plaza North on westbound New Jersey Turnpike.

According to the Port Authority spokesman, officers found no evidence to suggest that anyone suffered injuries in the crash or subsequent fire.

Officials are now trying to identify the owner of the car. 

Twitter user Andrew Clifford, from Miami Beach, Florida, shared a photo of what appears to be the Lamborghini engulfed in flames near the span early Monday morning.

Truck driver Tom Green told NorthJersey.com he was on the upper level of the George Washington Bridge when he saw the Lamborghini zoom past him.

Shortly after, the truck driver saw the roadway littered with car parts and the convertible on fire.

The man described the unidentified driver as a bald African-American man. He was accompanied by a thin black woman, whom Green witnessed trying to pry open the driver's door.

According to Green, the Lamborghini appeared brand-new and was seen cruising before the collision with its top down.
