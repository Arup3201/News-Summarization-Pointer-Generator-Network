Pirelli may yet change its thinking over the tyre choice for the forthcoming Brazilian Grand Prix, but not as a consequence of Felipe Massa's 'dangerous' comments.

Pirelli, the tyre manufacturer, recently announced they would be running the hard and medium compounds for the November 9 race on Massa's home turf at Interlagos.

Massa, however, slated the plan as 'dangerous, very dangerous', and 'totally unacceptable' given the track has been re-surfaced with a new layer of asphalt this year.

Massa added: 'Normally whatever track I go to where they put down new asphalt, it gets even easier on the tyres. I have no idea why they choose these tyres.'

Massa's remarks cut little ice with Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery as he told Press Association Sport: 'That's a little bit strange as we've raced before there with the hard tyre.

'The data would suggest, as it has done for the last three years, it's one of the more aggressive circuits we have on the calendar, with a risk of blistering problems.

'We know the soft tyre, with the extreme loads, has potential to blister, so the decision was taken to go with the harder tyre.'

Hembery, though, at least recognised the fact the resurfacing works may have a bearing and is willing to alter the compounds if the data dictates.

Hembery added: 'There is one factor, which we need to do a double verification on, which is the surface as they've now completed a full resurfacing.

'We'll do another check with that. We have a meeting with the Tyre Working Group, where we have all the tyre experts from all the teams, and we'll discuss it with them.

'If there is unanimous agreement then we can reconsider, so we are open to change.

'But it needs to done on fact, data and details than from a random comment.'
