Polish workers are already a favourite among many bosses looking to hire hard grafters, but one job advert placed on government websites seemed to rule out any chance for other nationalities.

With all the details written in Polish, the only information in English were on-screen headings which stated that it came under the category of ‘labourer’ and the location was London’s Docklands.

The advert, which appeared on the Government’s Directgov and Jobcentre Plus websites, as well as job site CV-Library.co.uk, is likely to be in breach of the Equality Act 2010.

It emerged days after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that Polish is now the second most common language in England and Wales.

Advert: This post looking for a labourer on the Jobcentre Plus website has been taken down because it was written almost entirely in Polish

Against the rules: The Department for Work and Pensions which runs the Jobcentre Plus site said today that all adverts must be posted in English

The Polish advert was spotted by a young 
man as he looked for opportunities on one of the Government websites.

The 21-year-old job hunter’s grandmother, who asked not to be named, 
said: ‘He was on my computer and saw there was a labourer job going, but
he didn’t have a clue what it said because it was in Polish.

‘A job like that should be open to everyone, not just those who can speak Polish.’

The woman, 64, from Dagenham, East London, added: ‘There are so many 
people like my grandson who need work. It isn’t right that the job is 
being advertised to one nationality.’

Her husband, a 68-year-old retired production controller, said: ‘My grandson is 21 and is desperate for full-time work.

‘It was a shock when they saw the advert. It isn’t fair that British 
people are not getting equal opportunities to work compared to people 
who have come to the UK.’

Vacancy: The post was advertising for a labourer to work in the Docklands area of London

The advert was also offering a rate of £6 per hour, below the £6.19 minimum wage for people aged 21 and over.

CV-Library said that details of the vacancy were taken down when it 
realised it was in Polish.

A spokesman added: ‘We flagged this up with 
the recruiter [who posted the advert], who explained that the employer 
who owns the construction site is a Polish man who doesn’t speak any 
English.

‘Due to health and safety reasons he therefore needs to employ someone who speaks Polish.

‘We explained that the job description needs to be written in English 
but he can state in it that the candidate must speak fluent Polish.’

A 2010 report into the meat and poultry processing industry by the 
Equality and Human Rights Commission found that vacancies were being 
handed to migrant workers because they are easier to exploit and often 
receive terrible pay and conditions.

Taken down: The advert has been removed from the Jobcentre Plus website the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed

Foreign workers were also favoured over British applicants because they 
were considered less likely to complain and worked harder.

The report revealed that ‘most’ recruitment firms had experience of 
their clients breaching the Race Relations Act, now replaced by the 
Equality Act, in asking for workers from ‘specific countries’.

A third 
also admitted unlawfully supplying workers based on what nationality 
they thought the processing firm wanted or as a result of ‘direct 
requests’.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We carry out checks 
on employers but, should an inappropriate job be posted, we take 
immediate steps to withdraw their advert and, if necessary, ban them 
from using the site.’
