He is one of Britain’s wealthiest hedge fund tycoons, with a fortune of hundreds of millions of pounds.

But Sir Christopher Hohn’s lifestyle is far more ‘Swatch’ watch than ‘jet-set’, according to a High Court judge.

He was speaking at the outset of what could be Britain’s first billion-pound divorce case.

Split: Jamie Cooper Hohn (left) believes her former husband Sir Christopher Hohn (right) is richer than he claims and is not being generous with his settlement

Sir Christopher sat just feet away 
from his estranged American-born wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, as the couple 
began their legal fight over the size of her financial settlement.

Mrs
 Cooper-Hohn, 49, claims their joint assets were about £849million and 
her husband is worth at least a further £872million from personal assets
 in his hedge fund – The Children’s Investment Fund group of companies –
 making a combined wealth of £1.72billion.

Acrimonious: Mrs Cooper-Hohn believes she is entitled to half of her husband's wealth 

But
 Sir Christopher, knighted last month in the Queen’s Birthday Honours, 
claims he is worth a mere £67million and that much of his wealth was 
built up after they separated.

The 47-year-old ‘non-dom’ says therefore 
his wife is entitled to only a quarter of his wealth. Mrs Cooper-Hohn 
wants half.

Last month she 
failed in a Court of Appeal bid to have expert evidence of Sir 
Christopher’s assets submitted in the settlement case.

The couple 
separated in December 2012 and divorced in April 2013 but the decree 
nisi has never been made absolute.

Yesterday the High Court heard that 
despite the tycoon’s incredible ability to make money on the financial 
markets the couple lived ‘modest lives’.

Martin Pointer, QC, for Mrs Cooper-Hohn, said: ‘Both are from modest backgrounds, neither brought any assets into the marriage.’

He added: They have led relatively modest lives. They have not led a jet-set lifestyle.’

Referring to Sir Christopher’s image of frugality Mrs Justice Roberts added: ‘It was more of a Swatch [watch] lifestyle.’

Despite
 this reputation Sir Christopher has ‘spent his whole life making money’
 earning up to £24.2million a year, Martin Pointer QC told the court. 
‘He has generated wealth of £3.45billion.’

Difference: Sir Chris puts a value of only £67million on the company’s net assets. But his wife claims his shares are worth more than £872million, and their combined fortune is £1.72billion

The
 son of a Jamaican immigrant to Britain, Sir Christopher grew up in 
Surrey and is known for his simple lifestyle. He reportedly lives in a 
rented house, drives a Toyota Prius and wears a black Swatch watch he 
has had for years. The couple met as students at Harvard University and 
married in 1985. They have four children – triplets aged 12 and an older
 child aged 15.

They have homes in London, the US and the West Indies.

But yesterday the court heard Mrs Cooper-Hohn and the children live in rented accommodation.

Sir
 Christopher has also become one of the UK’s leading philanthropists 
after giving more than £1billion to charity through the Children’s 
Investment Fund Foundation, which is linked to his hedge fund.

And it is as chairman of the CIFF that Mrs Cooper-Hohn claims she contributed to the couple’s combined wealth.

Yesterday
 she took the stand to give evidence. A court order bans the reporting 
of what she said.

Whatever the outcome the divorce settlement is likely 
to be the biggest in UK history, beating the £220million paid in 2011 by
 the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. The hearing continues.
