Striking 17th Century Petworth House sits in a majestic 700-acre Capability Brown landscaped estate in the heart of Sussex's rolling South Downs.

If it looks as pretty as a picture or like something out of a film, it's because it's both.

Renowned landscape artist J. M. W. Turner was a frequent visitor to Petworth in the 1800s, and a number of his acclaimed paintings are of the stately home and surrounding countryside.

Now the house features in several scenes in the movie Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall.

The National Trust-owned property is spectacular, not only because of its grand appearance (the building was given a Versailles-inspired makeover in 1688), but because it houses one of Britain's most important art collections outside London.

I walk open-mouthed through the North Gallery, which is jammed with iconic works by van Dyck, Bosch, Reynolds, Blake and Flaxman and, of course, Turner.

Petworth House owns 20 Turners - mostly commissioned in the 1800s by then-owner the 3rd Earl of Egremont, a patron of the arts who encouraged painters such as Constable and Turner to make Petworth their home.

Stepping into the Old Library, which Turner used as a studio, light streams in through huge double-height windows that offer views across the lake, grassland and deer grazing around old oak and lime trees.

I had reached Petworth after an easy 3.6-mile hike from the pretty hamlet of Lodsworth, strolling beneath a green canopy of oak, chestnut and holly.

This area doesn't only fire the imagination, it also produces excellent wines.

Nutbourne is a family-run winery ten miles from Petworth. The site is exquisite.

On the balcony of its 19th Century windmill, we sipped delicious sparkling wine, a nutty 2010 Brut voted best UK wine 2013, and marvelled at the sight of vines stretching to the horizon, golden-brown leaves glowing like sunflowers.

It was easy to see how these picturesque valleys and endless skies inspired Mr Turner.

The Mr Turner exhibition at Petworth House runs from January 10 to March 11, 2015. Entry is included in the general admission price. Visit www.national trust.org.uk/petworth-house.

HF Holidays (www.hfholidays.co.uk) offers a variety of walking holidays, including the Country House Escape at Abingworth (ten miles from Petworth), with accommodation at Abingworth Hall, guided walks on the South Downs Way and visits to Petworth.
