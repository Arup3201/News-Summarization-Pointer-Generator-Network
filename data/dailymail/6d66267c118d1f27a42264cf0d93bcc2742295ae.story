One of the country's most influential evangelical leaders has apologized for saying homosexuals should be killed - 35 years after he made the comment. 

Bob Jones III said gay men and lesbians should be stoned to death 'as the Bible commands' in 1980. 

The 75-year-old, whose grandfather founded Bob Jones University in South Carolina, made the remarks during a visit to the White House to demand that President Jimmy Carter not extend protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to gay men and lesbians.

Speaking to the Associated Press at the time, he said: 'I'm sure this will be greatly misquoted. But it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in Israel's day against murder and rape and homosexuality. 

'I guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned, if murderers were immediately killed as the Bible commands.' 

In an apology issued on Saturday he said the comments were 'antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming Christ.' 

According to NBC, he added: 'I take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric. 

'This reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago.

Regret: In an apology issued on Saturday, Jones III (pictured in 1974) said the comments were 'antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming Christ.'

'I cannot erase them, but wish I could, because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching. Neither before, nor since, that event in 1980 have I ever advocated the stoning of sinners.' 

The apology has been sought for three years by BJ Unity, an LGBT group made up of alumni from the evangelical college. 

In a statement they accepted his apology, saying: 'We are grateful that Bob Jones III has taken responsibility for these words; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows. 

'This means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation.'
