Two-year-old Lilly squeezes her mother tight and begs her to tell Fireman Sam to stop his siren. Sadly though, the deafening noise is out of her mum’s control. It’s 11pm and Lilly is cowering with her parents and little sister in the stairwell of her apartment building in Tel Aviv, as Hamas rockets fly overhead. The bellowing sirens wailing outside are the warning that Tel Aviv is under attack.

‘I realise now that having grown up in Manchester and spent most of my adult years in London I’d never experienced real fear before - not until I first heard that siren,’ says 35-year-old Micky Stemmer, mum to Lilly and 1-year-old Talia. ‘The worst part is knowing your children are in danger and being helpless to protect them.’ 

When the sirens start, Micky and the other residents of Tel Aviv have 90 seconds before the bombs reach them from Gaza. ‘All I can think about is getting my girls to as protected a place as possible,' she says, which for Micky is the inner stairwell of her apartment block. 'I feel total panic inside but I try to put on a calm face. I don’t want them to sense my fear - at least that I can try to control,’ she says.

Micky had always dreamed of living abroad, so when she married Swiss-born Ilan fours years ago, the couple decided to settle in New York. ‘Once we had kids, living in Manhattan became unfeasible, so we looked to move on. We thought about moving back to the UK but then Ilan, who's a lawyer in hi-tech, was offered a job in Israel.

'Of course I had my reservations - I knew there was a fragile state of peace in Israel - but I loved the atmosphere, the climate and the vibrancy of Tel Aviv, so we decided to make the move.

‘Within a week of being here in November 2012, Hamas fired rockets into Sderot, a town in the South of Israel. I was glad it hadn’t made the news in the UK because friends and family might have questioned our decision - and I didn’t want anything to ruin our new life.

'We’d started to make friends and I loved the laid back lifestyle. At the time, there hadn’t been a rocket attack on Tel Aviv for 21 years and the general consensus amongst the Israelis was that Tel Aviv was out of range, so I didn’t feel we were in danger.’ 

What Micky hadn’t taken into account was that only 40 miles away from Tel Aviv, the Gaza strip, given to Palestinians in 2005, was now under Hamas rule. ‘I remember watching the Israelis withdraw from Gaza on the BBC from my flat in Colindale and thinking it was a step towards peace in the region. I never imagined in my wildest dreams how negatively that news snippet would end up impacting my life and that years later that strip of land would become a launch pad for firing rockets at me and my family.’

So how does a British girl feel about the Israeli government’s retaliation?
‘What I realise living here is how targeted Israel tries to be with its response - they drop leaflets and phone ahead so civilians can evacuate before they strike terrorist targets. But by using their people as human shields and hiding rocket launchers and weapons in civilian houses and schools, the jihadist regime doesn't make it easy to avoid fatalities. But there's sadness here when there are fatalities on either side. No one wants blood shed.'

The hardest part of the ordeal for Micky is dropping her girls at nursery each morning, not knowing what the day holds. 'There are ten children in Lilly’s class but it takes them four minutes to get to the basement where the bomb shelter is, so they huddle in a corner of the classroom as far away from the windows as possible.

‘Some parents have stopped taking their kids to nursery but we both work so we don’t have that luxury. One morning last week, the day after the nursery in the South of Israel had been hit by a rocket, Lilly noticed me getting teary as I kissed her goodbye. She said, ‘Don’t worry mummy, you’ll pick me up soon’, which is exactly what I usually say to her, but in reverse. I felt like my heart was going to burst.’

‘At nursery they’ve told Lilly that the 
siren is Fireman Sam playing a game, so I’ve tried to keep up the 
pretense. But when she’s snatched from her bed in the middle of the 
night and sees people screaming and running for shelter during the day, 
even a two-year old is wise enough to know something frightening is 
happening,’ says Micky.

When Micky and her family huddle on the stairwell they wait to hear ‘the boom’. ‘The noise scares the girls but it signals relief,’ she says. The boom she’s referring to is the reverberation of the rockets being intercepted by the Iron Dome – new Israeli anti-missile technology.

Since the attacks began two weeks ago, the Iron Dome has managed to destroy the vast majority of the 1,600 Hamas rockets launched on Israel, preventing them from causing the desired death and devastation on the ground. 'Without the Iron Dome Hamas would have killed tens of thousands of Israeli civilians dead by now,' says Micky.

So will Micky give up on her dream lifestyle and move back home? ‘Leaving two jobs, nurseries and friends isn’t so straight forward,’ she says. ‘And in some ways I feel more at home here than ever. They say the worst of times bring out the best in human nature – and in my experience that’s certainly been true.

‘The other day when a siren went off I got stuck in the door of the supermarket with my double buggy and with only a few seconds left people were putting themselves in danger to help me get the girls out. Relative strangers have offered for us to move into their house so that we can be nearer to a proper bomb shelter at night. And if you walk down the street, front doors are left unlocked so passers by can shelter in the event of a missile attack.

‘It would also be hard to leave the friends we’ve lived through this trauma with because only they really understand what we’ve been through,' Micky adds.

Once such friend is fellow expat Rachel Gerstler from London. The mum-of-three left the UK for Shanghai eight years ago then relocated to Israel in 2012.

‘My brother moved to Israel from London and made a great life for himself here, so we decided to try it out instead of going back to London,’ says Rachel, mum to Oli, 10, Maya, 4 and Daniella, who turned three last week.

‘The first night the sirens went off I was out at friends and had left a babysitter at home with the kids. No one was expecting it.’

‘I’d just stepped out the door of their block and instead of going back in I started running to my car to get home to my kids, which was obviously impossible within 90 seconds. But in the panic that’s all I could think to do. I was throwing up as I ran and was retching the whole way home.

‘I drove along the deserted streets, knowing that if these rockets weren’t intercepted I’d be finished. I didn’t even know what a bomb sounded like so when I heard a boom overhead I didn't know if it was the noise of the rocket about to land, an explosion or an interception.

'I just kept going as fast as I could until I was back through the door with my children. They were asleep when I came in and the babysitter helped me carry them onto the floor of the bomb shelter in the basement.

‘Since then we’ve been sleeping in shelter every night. I can’t risk getting three kids to safety in 90 seconds on my own,' she says, but adds she feels lucky she's not in Southern Israel where they only have 15.

'The children have obviously been very traumatised and confused,' says Rachel, so after ten days of shelling, she and six other mums decided
 to brave an outing to a nearby swimming pool with their kids. ‘Suddenly the sirens went off and the kids in the 
pool started panicking and scrambling to get out,' she says. 'Parents were 
screaming, desperate to find their children, and 
kids were crying in a frenzy to get inside before the bombs were 
overhead. It was like a scene out of a disaster movie,’ she says. 'I never imagined this is where my journey would end up.' Let's hope this disaster movie soon has a peaceful ending.'
