A Canadian family are reeling after a stranger sent them a letter telling them to euthanize their severely autistic son.

During the summer, 13-year-old Max Begley spends his mornings with his grandmother Brenda Millson in Newcastle.

She says she was shaking after receiving a letter Friday from an anonymous neighbor complaining that the noise Max makes outside is 'DREADFUL!'  and that it 'scares the hell out of my normal children!' Mrs Millson shared the whole letter with CityNewsToronto.

Nothing good to say: An anonymous neighborhood mother wrote this letter to the grandmother of a severely autistic teen in Newcastle, Canada

Sadness and anger: Max's mother Karla Begley was in tears as she read the hateful letter directed at her son

Signed off 'one pissed off mother' the woman goes on to say that the noises Max makes are not appropriate for the neighborhood.

'Crying babies, music and even barking dogs are normal sounds in a residential neighborhood! He is not!'

The woman's deranged letter goes beyond the offensive noise complaint into even more repugnant territory, writing that Max is a 'hindrance'.

'Who the hell is going to care for him? No employer will ever hire him, no normal girl is going to marry/love him and you are not going to live forever!'

Then she recommends something truly atrocious. 

'Personally, they should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science. What the hell else good is he to anyone!'

'Do the right thing and move or euthanize him! Either way, we are ALL better off.'

'Who says that about a child?' Max's mother Karla Begley asked City News.

She started to cry as she explained that her secondary progressive multiple sclerosis keeps her from walking and running with her son.

13-year-old Max was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two and he spends his summer mornings at his grandmother's house, usually playing in the backyard

On his side: The neighborhood came out in support of Max after hearing about the abhorrent letter

Since learning about the letter, neighbors of Max's grandmother have come out in a public display of support for the boy in an attempt to out the letter's author.

Max's father is worried that the letter might lead to violence against his son.

'A person that's that crazy or demented who would fabricate something like that...it leads me to believe that they're very dangerous,' Jim Begley said, 'and right now I'm scared for my son's safety.

If the writer is identified, Max's family plans to press charges.
