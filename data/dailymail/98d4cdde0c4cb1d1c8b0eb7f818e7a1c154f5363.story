The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has launched his mobile marshmallow picture-printing business in a top London department store with the help of a reconditioned tricycle.

James Middleton was revealed earlier this year as the man behind Boomf on Demand (BOD) – a unique business which allows Instagram pictures to be printed onto square marshmallows.

Today, he revealed the business had gone ‘mobile’ when he unveiled an ‘on-the-go printing machine’ in the form of a repurposed tricycle.

The business has now gone 'mobile' with an 'on-the-go printing machine' in the form of a re-purposed tricycle. To celebrate the launch of Boomf on Demand, Mr Middleton and his team took the retro bike to Selfridges

The machine allows photos to be printed onto marshmallows instantly, before they are sold as a box for £12

The machine allows images to be printed onto marshmallows instantly in store, before they are sold as a box of nine for £12.

It means members of the public can give the business their favourite images before watching them be transferred onto the tasty treats, ready for eating.

The Boomf brand was launched by Mint Digital towards the end of last year, but James Middleton’s involvement was only revealed in January.

The entrepreneur, who cycled across the U.S with his sister Pippa last month for Race Across America 2014, teamed up with Mint Digital chief creative officer Andy Bell for the latest venture.

Speaking in a tongue-in-cheek manner at the launch of the ‘mobile Boomf’ today, Mr Bell described how the pair successfully transferred the tricycle idea into a reality.

He said: ‘For many months, deep in the Berkshire countryside, a man dreamed of a tricycle that could create personalised marshmallows at the touch of a button. Many scoffed at his vision. Some said it couldn’t be done.

The retro tricycle used as Boomf's 'on-the-go machine' was assembled using items mostly from eBay

‘Luckily this was the 21st century and eBay had been invented. Every obscure part needed to assemble this vision could be tracked down using a technique known as “searching the web”.

‘Dyslexic super-powers allowed combinations of parts to be imagined in multiple dimensions as an entirely novel contraption. Few could understand this vision or why so many parts needed to be bought on eBay.

‘The machine had to be ready in four days. It was in incredible rush but, as luck would have it, the man in the Berkshire countryside was a boyhood fan of Scrapheap Challenge, and liked nothing more than a tinkering challenge against a fast approaching deadline.’

The ‘man in the Berkshire countryside’ is of course reference to Mr Middleton, who grew up in the county with Kate before she went on to marry Prince William.

Mr Middleton said that the most enjoyable part of creating the product was coming up with its name, Boomf

Now uncle to Prince George, the businessman is hoping to make a profit from his latest venture, which comes after he failed to make a profit with his cake and bread company for a second year.

Accounts filed earlier this year revealed how Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £21,148 for the 12 months to March 2013.

It means the company, which was set up in April 2011 by Mr Middleton, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in its first year of trading. The company also owes creditors £35,951.

However, Mr Middleton is hoping his latest quirky business will attract a wealth of custom.

He said: 'Boomf is the noise a marshmallow makes when it falls through your letter box'

Described as a ‘Willy-Wonka like machine that’s built out of a refurbished 1950s Pashley’s ice cream tricycle’, the retro bike will feature regularly in Selfridges on Oxford Street, central London.

A spokesman for Boomf said: ‘Boomf on Demand takes Boomf out of the factory, and lets you create your marshmallows live, in real time.

‘In short, Boomf on Demand lets you eat your face without delay.’
