A software glitch at Melbourne airport caused air traffic controllers to lose the position of at least nine planes on the tarmac.

The Senate Estimates committee was told by Independent Senator Nick Xenophon the February 13 incident happened after integrated tower automation suite (INTAS) - a program used for air traffic control - failed. 

He said he was informed there were at least nine aircrafts who were waiting on the tarmac to take off at the time the software glitch happened about 10pm.

Central Queensland University's Ronald Bishop said this flaw in INTAS had potential to trigger a similar incident to the one which happened on the Spanish island of Tenerife

'If this was a foggy night in Melbourne, this could have been potentially a serious incident,' Senator Xenophon told the committee late on Monday night.

Central Queensland University's head of program for aviation Ronald Bishop said this flaw in INTAS had potential to trigger a similar incident to the one which happened on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which is considered to be the worst accidents in aviation history.

In 1977, two Boeing 747s collided after thick fog prevented air traffic control and pilots to see there were two planes sharing the one runway, killing 583 people.

There was no ground radar so the air traffic control could only rely on reports from radio communications.

'For example, if there's a plane on Taxiway Charlie, they're holding them there but then they're not in the system, the controller could potentially put another plane in that spot,' Mr Bishop told Daily Mail Australia.

If this happens then usually the pilot would see the other plane there and tell air traffic control.

But Mr Bishop said this link in the 'safety chain' would break if there was heavy fog.

'Now one plane could strike the other one, which is probably full of fuel, and it could cause an issue,' he said.

'This could happen yes... but there are probably four or five scenarios we haven't thought of that could happen.

'Like MH370, we never thought a plane could disappear off the face of the earth.

'I don't know about you but I like people to know where the planes are. Someone should know where they are at all times.' 

Mr Bishop said if there had been heavy fog then planes could have collided on the taxi runway 

On Tuesday, Senator Xenophon told Daily Mail Australia: 'There are genuine concerns of ongoing software problems with INTAS.'

He said he had received complaints from air traffic controllers and pilots about the software, and their concerns needed to be looked into adequately.

Air Services Australia's Greg Hood told the committee the organisation had been informed about the situation and poor weather conditions had grounded planes for more than an hour.

He said this length of inactivity caused a number of planes to disappear off their radar.

'My understanding on that night in question [was] that there was thunderstorm activity and a number of aircraft that were taxiing in from the runway were unable to reach their gate,' Mr Hood told the committee.

To fix this problem, the window of time for a plane to stay in the system had been extended to five hours.

Mr Hood said he did not anticipate hearing this line of enquiry from Senator Xenophon but could give him more information if the politician wanted it.

While the Air Services Australia general manager of air traffic control was speaking, the South Australian representative said he had been sent a text by someone who had been there at time of the incident.

Senator Xenophon related the message to the committee, which said the idea that a thunderstorm had caused the glitch was 'crap' as it had already passed over Melbourne.
