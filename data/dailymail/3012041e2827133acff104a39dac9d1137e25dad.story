Bargain hunters are expected to make a dash for the best holiday deals this weekend,as travel firms gear up for 'Sunshine Saturday'.

The stampede for holidays is expected to see thousands booking a break in the sun, as people try to beat the the post-Christmas winter blues, made worse by the relentless stormy weather in recent weeks.

Travel firm Thomson told MailOnline it is expecting to see more than one million people visit one of its high street stores or log on to its website over the 24-hour period.

Of these around 35,000 customers are expected to part with their money and secure themselves a well-earned break.

It will make Saturday the busiest holiday shopping day of the year, prompted by the stormy weather and widespread flooding.

Thomson and fellow operator First Choice said more than half of all bookings are likely to be made on a tablet or mobile phone.

Head of marketing, Jeremy Ellis, said: 'With Christmas firmly out of the way many people want a holiday in the sunshine to look forward to.

'Over the last few years we've seen a trend towards booking holidays earlier and with record bookings over Christmas we're expecting the rush to continue with our busiest day of year this Saturday.

'It's also the perfect time for Brits to take advantage of some of the great January deals available to places like Greece and Croatia or further afield to 
Jamaica and Mauritius.'

Bookings are expected to peak in store at 2pm and online at around 8.45pm.

Short haul breaks in Europe are tipped to be the most popular, with Greece, the Balearics and Croatia likely to be the must-visit destinations.

While for those in search of adventures on far flung shores, places like Jamaica, Mexico and Mauritius are expected to top the wish list.

The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said: 'Members are reporting strong bookings and we expect this weekend and the next few weeks to be busy.'

Thomson and First Choice said they saw record bookings on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, with bookings up 10 per cent on last year.

A surge of people rushing to treat themselves saw traffic peak between 10am and noon on Christmas Day with more bookings than ever before made on tablet computers or mobiles.

Tenerife proved the most popular destination on Christmas Day, with many sun seekers attracted by the regular temperatures of 22C to 28C.

The Association of British Travel Agents said it is 'cautiously optimistic' about the holiday market in 2014, predicting people will spend more money than in 2013.

Thomson and First Choice predict a million people will visit their stores and log on to their websites on Saturday, hunting for cut-price deals. Of those around 35,000 are expected to snap up a bargain and book a break in the sun

Firm favourite Greece is expected to once again be one of the most attractive short haul options for people booking up their summer holiday

The association's destinations to watch in 2014 include Brazil, where the World Cup will kick off in June, the Caribbean, Greece, Mauritius and Sicily in Italy.

Mark Tanzer ABTA Chief Executive said: 'We know that Brits hate to cut back on their holidays and after several years of tough market conditions, we are seeing early signs of more optimism amongst British consumers.

'However, with the squeeze on household budgets continuing, we are expecting that tried and tested destinations and package holidays will continue to perform well in the coming year.

'We are also expecting a range of other overseas destinations to prove popular in 2014, as well as another good year for domestic tourism after the heatwave in the UK in summer 2013.'
