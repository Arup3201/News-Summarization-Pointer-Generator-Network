An 82-year-old woman was arrested after trying to steal a $7.39 bottle of Sexual Fantasies body spray from a CVS Pharmacy near her Georgia home.

Anneliese Young was caught by a store employee who spotted her placing the item into her purse in the Augusta store on January 27, according to police reports.

The elderly woman then walked out of the CVS without paying for the 'Fireworks' fragrance.

The Fireworks fragrance 'provides a burst of sensuality as plump wild strawberries, succulent peaches and voluptuous vanilla come together'

Young was then confronted by an employee outside the store just before 2pm.

The pensioner was apologetic, admitted to the theft and handed over the Sexiest Fantasies spray.

The Fireworks fragrance of Sexiest Fantasies 'provides a burst of sensuality as plump wild strawberries, succulent peaches and voluptuous vanilla come together', according to the manufacturer. 

The ingredients 'create a fragrance as addictive and seductive as the woman who wears it'.

The product is 'sure to drive men wild', according to The Smoking Gun.  

The CVS employee called Richmond County Sheriff's Office to report Young. 

Deputies arrested the woman after the worker advised that 'she did wish to prosecute', according to police records.

Young was later booked into the Richmond County jail.

The woman's arrest came just five days after another attempt at shoplifting in the Augusta, Georgia area.

On January 22, a man was arrested after he was caught stuffing steaks down his pants at a Wal-Mart, according to WRDW. 

When Demetress Glenn Howard, 51, was stopped by store employees, he pulled two steaks out of his pants. 

He also handed over a bag of chicken wings.

Young was confronted by a CVS employee outside the store just before 2pm. The worker called the police and said she wanted to prosecute
