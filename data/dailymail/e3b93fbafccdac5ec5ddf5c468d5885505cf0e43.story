We can’t say we weren’t warned. Roy Hodgson went out of his way before the game to insist that this wouldn’t be the start of a new era and he was right.

Hodgson is always wary of the easy sound-bite so he can’t be blamed for refusing to play the media’s game. 

He probably suspected, rightly, that to bill this game as a new dawn would have been trite – and it would. More to the point, he probably also feared his team could easily be mediocre again.

There was never going to be a sudden upturn in fortunes and a surge of fresh excitement as there is no golden generation waiting to step up. 

Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have retired, but the latter hardly played, so it’s not as though there have been a raft of thirty something players blocking the progress of the youngsters.

With England, you get what we have; what we have is shallow seam of talent. It was clear to all - certainly to the paying public, who recorded the lowest international crowd at the new Wembley - that the World Cup was a reflection on England’s real status. 

Tricky: Raheem Sterling wins a penalty in the second half which was despatched by Rooney

Dastardly foreigners didn’t conspire to undo us, there was no hand of God on which to place the blame; England simply couldn’t match good teams tactically or psychologically.

All of which means the road to Euro 2016 is going to be slow and steady for this current generation entrusted with representing the national team. 

If you wished to be optimistic you would point to Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling’s link ups and Danny Welbeck’s enthusiasm when he came on.

In fact, principally you would look to Sterling, especially when he was moved behind the front two for the last 20 minutes, and you might even feel hopeful about the future, though that thought in itself is a little scary; that a nineteen year old carries our hopes.

If you wanted a reality check you would turn to the back four. Phil Jagielka is being eased out after a World Cup which exposed his talents, but not because there is anyone better, simply because you might as well bet on Phil Jones at 22 potentially getting better.

In a first half in which Norway declined to participate meaningfully, it was difficult to judge the defenders. In the second, when presumably their manager Per-Mathias Hogmo had reminded them quite how ordinary England are, the shortcomings were painfully familiar. 

In his defence: John Stones was steady at right back but looks to be a more natural centre back

Hard to handle: Joshua King (right) caused Gary Cahill and Phil Jones problems 

Joshua King is no Luis Suarez but he forced Joe Hart into two good saves, with Cahill and Jones error prone and static. With a Nemanja Vidic or a John Terry alongside them, they can look good but neither looks capable of assuming that dominant role without a mentor.

John Stones may graduate into the centre. He looks more comfortable there than at right back, where he was merely steady enough.

Leighton Baines was presumably grateful for a quiet night opposite Mats Moller Daehl after his travails in Brazil. In the next two years we will discover whether these players, along with Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker, Calum Chambers and perhaps some outliers such as Eric Dier can develop into defenders of international quality. For now, they remain what they were in Brazil: fragile.

Step up: The likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (above) and Jack Wilshere must establish a grip on games

We saw a little of Fabian Delph and he was clearly determined to impress, which on a night which was presaged by exceedingly low expectations and delivered on them, was at least encouraging. But it is Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlian who need to establish their grip on games. 

They have reached a stage in their careers where they must prove they are more than youthful promise. Jordan Henderson was assured and looks to be slowly getting the hang of his role for England.

No-one but a fool would say England are about to rise to great heights. We would settle for: ‘England could be better.’ They could. But it will require an awful lot of players to grow up quickly and grasp responsibility and young English players have not been in the habit of doing that in recent years.
