It is an email that will probably make most senior managers squirm in their seats.

An employee at a media agency in London has decided to send a leaving speech detailing his grievances with a company manager to all members of staff.

And worse still - that email has now gone viral after it was posted online, with its hashtag trending on Twitter.

Damning: The email from disgruntled employee Kieran Allen provides reasons as to why he has decided to leave his job at London-based media agency MEC Global. Parts are censored for legal reasons

The phrase - coined by Twitter users - refers to the worker's boss at the UK media agency MEC Global, whose name we have withheld for legal reasons.

Employee Kieran Allen, a senior account manager at the company, has lambasted his manager for ruining the past 8 months of his working life.

Mr Allen has decided to quit the company after 2 and a half years of 'loyal service' because he alleges the manager blocked his bonus, gave him a verbal warning for poor performance and put him on a performance review, according to the email that was sent yesterday morning.

This, Mr Allen says, was after he was persuaded to stay with the company with the promise of a substantial pay-rise and rapid development.

But following the promotion he suffered a break down from stress after being overloaded with work and had to take two weeks off work.

It was only after his return in March that he says the manager 'instead of welcoming me back and looking to make things right, instead attacked me and made me feel an outsider.

'I was made to feel that I had actually done wrong'.

The hashtag started trending on Twitter after the email was uploaded by someone on the internet

In the email Mr Allen also alleges the manager has jokingly referred to the Paralympics as the 'Spastic Olympics' and openly claimed to be proud 'not to have a drop of Jewish blood in him'.

He claims he 'regularly made sexist and other bigoted remarks' and 'took a female colleague out for a drink on the day he interviewed her, then later took her back to the MEC offices that night and had sexual relations with her in the meeting rooms on the 3rd floor'.

He said the allegations were 'common knowledge throughout the team' and said 'it is hard to fathom that such a man is responsible for the work well-being of over 30 staff'.

Before signing off the message he wrote, 'I am writing this message in order to expose the failings and protect others in future' and 'I am a good human being who treats people with respect.'

'Not one thing on this email has been exaggerated or made up. This is my truth to you all.

'No doubt I fully expect the above to be ripped apart but as long as the truth is out there then that’s all I can do.'

A spokesman for MEC told MailOnline: 'We are sad that one of our employees has chosen to share their personal views in such a public way and has left the company with such bad feeling.  

'We are taking this issue seriously though given the highly personal nature of the email, we cannot comment further.'

The alleged response by management to the email sent to members of staff, posted on a website

According to a post on website Pastebin, management allegedly sent an email to staff after Mr Allen sent his email saying: 'By now, I expect you will have read 
the email sent to the company from Kieran Allan, and I am sure that once
the surprise has subsided, you are probably left with the same feeling
of sadness that I have.

'It's  sad that following the level of support
Kieran has had for him to send such an unprofessional and personal 
message to a public group and I'm even sadder for the colleagues 
directly affected by his comments.

'I 
was hoping to talk directly to Kieren to see what help I could give 
but however he chose to come in, send the mail and leave immediately 
afterwards.'

The email said 'those affected' would be consulted to see what action, if any, they wanted the company to take.
