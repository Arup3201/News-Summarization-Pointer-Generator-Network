Brian Williams has been accused of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

The allegation comes from a Boston firefighter who served on the committee that organized the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event at the city's national convention center in 2006.

Neal Santangelo, a veteran of the Navy submarine service, told the Boston Herald that Williams had agreed six months in advance to serve as master of ceremonies at the gala banquet.

Brian Williams appeared briefly during the September 30, 2006, episode when he featured in a Weekend Update sketch alongside Amy Poehler and was informed that Seth Meyers had got the job as her co-anchor 

Then on the day of the event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but could only greet guests and leave.

According to Santangelo, he arranged for a police escort to rush Williams to the airport so he could get back to New York.

He recalls that he and the other organizers were stunned when they found out that the 'pressing engagement' had been a walk-on part on that evening's Saturday Night Live.

Williams only appeared briefly during the September 30 episode, featuring in a Weekend Update sketch alongside Amy Poehler in which he was informed that Seth Meyers had got the job as her co-anchor.

'I … cannot believe that you left us for this,' Santangelo wrote in a letter to Williams the following week. 

'In an act of egotistical, blatant self-promotion, you deceived the (Medal of Honor) Recipients, declined to break bread with them and disrespected them.

The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States

'Pressing engagement': Brian Williams has been accused of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces in 2006 so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live

'You placed comedy before courage … Your conduct was irreverent, insulting, incomprehensible and shameful. 

'You may attempt to 'spin' the issue to support your position, but that will do nothing but bring you further shame in my eyes.'

Santangelo told the Herald that he never sent the three-page letter, out of fear he would come off as a 'loose cannon'.

He says both the local committee and national Medal of Honor society agreed with his sentiments but he was advised against 'burning bridges.'

Williams still sits on several advisory boards of the Medal of Honor Foundation, an adjunct of the MOH society.

'You need to apologize to America's veterans, and to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces defending freedom around the globe,' Santangelo also wrote in his October 5, 2006, letter. 'Anything less is unacceptable.'

Sangangelo admitted that his experience of working with Williams mean't he didn't have any sympathy for the anchor's current troubles.

Williams apologized last week for falsely claiming that he was in a helicopter that had been hit by a grenade while in Iraq in 2003, but many critics and veterans have called for him to be fired.

Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. 

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. 

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. 

Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook.

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. 

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. 

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there.

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ 

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away.

Boston, 2006

A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. 

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.

That engagement later transpired to be a walk-on part on an episode of Saturday Night Live

Organizer Neal Santangelo was so angered by Williams' behavior that he wrote him a letter

'In an act of egotistical, blatant self-promotion, you deceived the (Medal of Honor) Recipients and disrespected them,' wrote Santangelo

Although the national Medal of Honor society agreed with his sentiments, they advised him against 'burning bridges' and so he didn't send it
