Ah, the Oyster card. That most beloved access-all-areas key to the Transport for London network, which last week proved irksomely impotent in light of the tube strikes carried out by Bob Crow and his transport workers union.

A repeat performance of city-crippling industrial action was threatened again this week, until, at the eleventh hour, it was called off.

Londoners rejoiced. Meetings took place, plans were carried out, nobody had to sleep on the office sofa, and today, on Valentine's Day, a Holborn-based start-up has said thank-you to Bob Crow and his crew for cancelling the second set of strikes… by putting a cheeky, interactive love poem on every Oyster card in the city.

The tongue-in-cheek Ode To Bob Crow bursts out of every Oyster card - and every picture of an Oyster card, too – when the travel card is viewed through the 'magic lens app' Blippar on a smartphone or tablet.

1. Download the app on your smart phone or tablet

2. Open the app

3. Fill the screen with your Oyster card or an image of an Oyster card

4. Wait for the magic blipp to happen

5. Enjoy!

Accompanied by heart-themed graphics, tube trains, and the international debut of Bob Crow The Cupid, the poem's verses roll across the screen to the dulcet tones of jolly music.

The poem begins: 'Roses are red, Londoners were blue, we were mighty mad at you. You ruined last week, we have to say, when you took our tubes away.'

To hear the rest, blipp the Oyster Card on this screen, or blipp an actual Oyster card in your wallet.

Jess Butcher, Co-Founder and CMO of Blippar, told MailOnline: 'As a start-up (frequently working around the clock!) we were hugely relieved when this week's strike was called off, and thought we'd have some fun expressing our appreciation to Bob in the way we know best... through our magic mobile technology.

'We're normally busy turning CocaCola cans, KitKats, Argos catalogues, posters and magazines interactive for our clients, but this time we wanted to do something for us and our fellow Londoners, so have "borrowed" the beloved Oyster card to host a magic Valentine's thank-you to Bob on.

'We hope Londoners enjoy the experience of it coming to life in their hands (plus of course, our superb poetry-writing skills).'

Blippar is a magic lens app that unlocks interactive content - including videos, graphics, songs, games, coupons and 'try-on' experiences - from real-word stuff.

Whether the 'stuff' is a ketchup bottle, chocolate bar, poster, magazine page, T-shirt or coffee cup, looking at it 'through' the Blippar app on your phone or tablet will make it burst into life.

Brands and celebrities such as CocaCola, Disney, Warner Bros, Heinz, L'Oreal, Justin Beiber and the Wanted have used the app to add exclusive content to their products or adverts.

Crow is General Secretary of the National
 Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), which took strike 
action last week - alongside the Union for People in Transport and 
Travel (TSSA) - against London Mayor Boris Johnson's plans to close 
ticket offices.

While Blippar, which was founded by four friends in London in 2011, usually works with clients to create bespoke blipps on products and adverts, the fun-loving start-up is no stranger to 'guerilla blipping' of this nature.

The innovative gang has already made the Oyster card blippable once before, when blipping revealed how well each tube line was running.

They plan to return to that blipp from tomorrow, when Valentine's Day is over.

Blippar have also applied their technology to the British passport, a five-pound note, an American dollar bill and the 'smoking kills' logo on cigarette packets.

The latter was part of a campaign for the British Heart Foundation.
