The controversial prosecution of an NHS doctor over female genital mutilation was justified, a Liberal Democrat minister has claimed.

Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said the 'shock waves' the case created would serve as a warning to others about the dangers associated with treating victims.

She was speaking after Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, was acquitted in less than 25 minutes of carrying out FGM on a young woman at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012.

Lynne Featherstone said it was right to put Dhanuson Dharmasena on trial - even though he was acquitted in less than 25 minutes of carrying out FGM on a young woman at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012

He was accused of illegally stitching the woman after she had given birth – re-doing the FGM she had as a six year-old in Somalia. 

But a jury swiftly found him not guilty after hearing he put in a single stitch to stop her bleeding. 

Another man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was also cleared of abetting the offence.

The Crown Prosecution Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, have been forced to defend their actions amid accusations of running a 'show trial' which risked diverting attention from genuine victims of the crime.

Doctors and lawyers said the 'insulting' prosecution had also risked making other doctors fearful of treating FGM victims.

But yesterday, Miss Featherstone, the Lib Dem MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, in north London, said it was right to put Dr Dharmasena on trial. 

'Whatever the outcome of that case, the shock waves sent through the medical profession when the arrest was announced, hopefully will be very significant in making everyone in the frontline think, what am I doing? Do I know about this?' she said.

Miss Featherstone, speaking at a Zero Tolerance to FGM Summit in central London yesterday, added: 'I would ask health professionals to remember that is who they are protecting. These girls who have no voice, no choice and no control in their lives.'

Keith Vaz MP has warned that the 'unfortunate' handling of the case by the CPS would 'damage the campaign to encourage people to report FGM because there is a feeling that this has been initiated in haste'.
