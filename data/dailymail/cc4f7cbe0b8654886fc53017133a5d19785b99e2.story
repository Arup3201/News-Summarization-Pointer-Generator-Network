Five Royal Marines who were accused of killing an injured insurgent in Afghanistan have challenged a ruling that their names should be made public.

The order was made after one of the men was convicted of murder over the death of the enemy fighter, while two more were cleared and the other two had all charges against them dropped.

During the trial of three of the servicemen at a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, an order was in place which prevented them being named.

Challenge: Five servicemen investigated over the death of an Afghan insurgent are fighting a ruling that their names should be made public

Last Friday a court martial board 
found a commando, known only as Marine A, guilty of murdering the man in
Helmand Province more than two years ago.

Two
others, known as Marines B and C, were acquitted. Charges against a 
further two Marines, referred to as D and E, had previously been 
discontinued.

Judge 
Advocate General Jeff Blackett made a ruling that the names of the three
defendants and of Marines D and E should be identified publicly, but 
they have now lodged a challenge against that decision.

The
move was confirmed by the Judicial Office today and a hearing before 
the Court Martial Appeal Court in London is expected to be held in the 
last week of November.

Sentence: Marine A, pictured, could face life in jail when he is sentenced on December 6

Judge Blackett, when ruling that the 
anonymity order should be lifted, said: 'The principle of open justice 
is immutable and must only be restricted where either the administration
of justice would be seriously affected without the grant of an order 
for anonymity or there would be a real and immediate risk to the 
personnel were anonymity not granted.

'This
is not a case relating to the administration of justice and I am not 
satisfied that those who seek a continuance of the anonymity order have 
demonstrated that the fear that the marines' lives will be at risk is 
objectively well-founded.'

Counsel
for the marines said they wished to appeal and the judge said the 
anonymity order would remain in force pending further determination by 
the Court Martial Appeal Court.

Marine A, 39, could face life in prison when he is sentenced on December 6.

The head of the Armed Forces said this week that he should not be shown any clemency for his 'heinous crime'.

General Sir Nick Houghton said: 'Murder is murder, 
this is a heinous crime. No serviceman or woman is above the law.'

Marine A killed 
the insurgent near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 
servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade were killed and the Taliban hung the 
limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’.

Not punishing him would severely 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies', General Houghton said.

‘It would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading, some sort of exemption.'

Lord
Guthrie, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, agreed and said: ‘The military 
should observe the highest standards, and if some crime is committed, 
like everybody else they should pay the price. Murder is murder.’

Marine A was found guilty by a court 
martial of shooting the injured insurgent in the chest at close range 
with a 9mm pistol, then taunting him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you
c***.’ 

He was convicted after a two-and-a-half week trial of slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011.

His
badly injured victim was found with an AK-47 assault rifle and grenade 
following an attack on a British base. Marine A denied murder, claiming he 
thought the insurgent was already dead.

He is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active 
service abroad since the Second World War.

His closest friends and family maintain that his killing was out of character.

A family friend told the Mail: ‘We know him and the shooting was not him, it wasn’t in character. He is keeping positive.’

Relatives of troops who died as they served alongside Marine A in 42 
Commando criticised the military authorities for prosecuting him. One 
bereaved father said the decision was ‘inappropriate’. Others said the 
unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account.

Retired
Colonel Mike Dewar said it was important to ‘make exceptions for 
soldiers in extraordinary circumstances’. He added: ‘This is a 
completely different environment to a cold-blooded murder in normal 
circumstances.’

Some
senior retired commanders, including Major General Julian Thompson, who
led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, have called for leniency 
when Marine A is sentenced.
