A teenager who feared she would never walk again, is now preparing for a ballet exam after her spine miraculously healed itself.

Megan Kershaw, 14, was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in 2008, which caused her to collapse at school.

During a nine-hour operation to remove three-quarters of the tumour, doctors discovered the cancer had spread to her spine, causing spinal fractures, and for years she was confined to a wheelchair.

Megan Kershaw from Doncaster has now fully recovered from a rare form of liver cancer which caused her spine to collapse

It was during treatment that Professor Nick Bishop from Sheffield Children’s Hospital  suggested they should try and let the spine heal naturally.

Now Megan's back is fully healed and doctors have been amazed by her speedy recovery.

Professor Nick Bishop said: 'The speed of recovery is fantastic and just shows how well children’s bones can recover in this kind of situation.

'Her spine is healing itself without 
any special treatment from us. The spine’s building blocks, the 
vertebrae, have growth plates on their upper and lower surfaces.

“It is these growth plates that have restored Megan’s vertebral architecture in such an exemplary fashion.

'Megan no longer needs to see me now 
her spine has healed.'

Megan is once again enjoying her favourite hobbies which include dancing, horse-riding, skiing and riding roller coasters.

Her mother Deborah, 48, from Misson, near Doncaster said: 'She is a miracle. It is incredible what has happened and what the body can do.

'She’s back to being a normal healthy child and can do all the things her friends do.

'She has shown tremendous courage through everything and she’s back to her dancing which has helped her very much.'

Megan still needs regular check-ups and is having a scan at the end of March to check on her progress.

The youngster previously hit headlines when Simon Cowell paid for her to go on a trip to Disneyland in Florida for her 13th Birthday.

He stepped in when he heard she had made a 'wish board' that included meeting him, Girls Aloud and the dream trip to Disney.

Megan is now preparing for a Royal Academy of Dance ballet exam 
next month.

Dance tutor James Vaughan, who taught Megan before she was diagnosed with liver cancer said: 'Megan always had a great attitude and never missed a single lesson.

'When she was at her worst after the treatments had ravaged her body she first came back to class in a wheelchair unable to walk very well and she was a shadow of her former self.

'I was delighted to have her back and her determination to succeed despite her illness was an inspiration to us all.'
