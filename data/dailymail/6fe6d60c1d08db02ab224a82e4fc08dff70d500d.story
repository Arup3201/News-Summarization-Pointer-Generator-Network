Trap: Emma Watson is the favorite celebrity bait for cyber criminals trying to lure Internet users, it has emerged

Harry Potter star Emma Watson is the favourite celebrity bait for cyber criminals trying to lure internet users, it has emerged.

Internet security firm McAfee said today that the English actress is the 'most dangerous' celebrity to search for online.

That's because many sites use Miss Watson to trick users into downloading malicious software or to steal personal information.

When searching for the 22-year-old, there's a one-in-eight chance of landing on a malicious site.

This is the sixth time the Intel-owned security technology company has conducted the study, which was last year topped by Heidi Klum.

Female celebrities are far more likely to be utilised by cyber criminals: late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was the only male in the top 20.

Others among the riskiest celebrities to search online are Jessica Biel, Eva Mendes, Selena Gomez and Halle Berry.

McAfee says people using the internet should be aware of malicious content hiding in 'tiny' places like shorted URLs which can spread virally in emails, text messages or social networking sites.

The firm has previously said that singers and sports stars are safer searches than models and movie stars.

Last year, supermodel and TV host Heidi Klum was named as the most dangerous celebrity in cyberspace.

McAfee said searching for downloads and screensavers for the Project Runway judge and former Victoria's Secret model, 38, ran at nearly a one in 10 chance of landing on a malicious website.

CNN talk show host Piers Morgan, 46, a judge on America's Got Talent and the former editor of the Daily Mirror, was the most dangerous male celebrity in last year's survey.
