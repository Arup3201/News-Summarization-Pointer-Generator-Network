Jack Laugher became the most successful diver at these Games by winning the three-metres synchronised title with training partner and ‘best mate’ Chris Mears.

The pair, who train in Leeds, embraced when the big screen confirmed a score of 431.94 before seeking out their mothers to ‘give them a big squeeze’.

They finished 28 points ahead of Australian silver medalists Matt Mitcham and Grant Nel, with English pair Nick Robinson-Baker and Freddie Woodward clinching a surprise bronze with 364.41 points.

Laugher, 19, already had two Commonwealth gold medals and one silver before Tom Daley had even competed at Edinburgh’s Royal Commonwealth Pool, proving that British diving is more than a one-man show.

Mears, 21, is one of Sportsmail’s Road to Rio athletes.

‘These Games have been an absolute dream for me,’ said Laugher. ‘I was hoping, if I could get lucky, to come away with three medals. To come away with two golds and a silver is fantastic.’

Laugher, who was crowned one-metre springboard champion on Wednesday and a silver medallist in the three-metres individual event on Thursday, added: ‘To do the last one with my best mate and to get that alongside each other is what we have been dreaming of all year.’ Laugher and Mears’ best dive was an inward three-and-a-half somersault, for 85.68, but the pair produced three dives over 80 points in a world-class performance.

Mears, a music producer in his spare time, told Laugher jokes and they reminded each other of their favourite movie lines between nerve-shredding dives. 

Too good: Laugher and Mears finished almost 30 points ahead of Australia after a series of impressive dives

‘I see Chris dancing around to house music, throwing his hands in the air, while I listen to more chilled music,’ said Laugher.

‘We get each other laughing between dives. If you’re happy and chilled out, you dive well.’

Mears, fourth in the one-metre springboard, was delighted to make amends. ‘I was gutted with the one-metre,’ he said, ‘I was so close to the bronze that it put pressure on me today.’

Mears recovered from life-saving surgery to remove a ruptured spleen suffered while diving in 2009 and added:

‘I learnt a lot. I probably wouldn’t have made London if I hadn’t gone through that.

I wasn’t really working hard at school or in training. It made me realise life only happens once and you have to work hard if you want to achieve your dreams.
