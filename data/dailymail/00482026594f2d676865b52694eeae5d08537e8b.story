This video captures the heartwarming moment Toby the rescue dog protectively cuddles his sick best friend Carter as the adorable pair lie on the sofa watching cartoons.

When Carter's mother, Devin Crouch, turns the corner while filming the touching scene, Toby's paw is seen wrapped firmly around the poorly toddler in an obvious display of compassion.

As the aptly worded lyrics to a song in the cartoon ring out -  'friends help each other, yes they do' - it seems loving pooch Toby has been taking notes. 

Adorable: The heartwarming video shows Toby the rescue dog protectively cuddling his sick best friend Carter

Since Mrs Crouch, of Indiana, uploaded the moving footage on YouTube it has been viewed almost 100,000 times.

Underneath her post she writes: 'Mom walked in the room and saw Toby the rescue and Carter the toddler cuddling. It's a heartwarming moment!'

Toby was adopted by Mrs Crouch and her partner Jake - after his previous owner abandoned him outside a local bank.

The couple soon had a baby, Carter, and as the boy grew up he and Toby became inseparable.

In the footage, the pair can be heard watching popular kids' TV show Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

The show sees Daniel the tiger invite a new generation of preschoolers into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe every day - sharing adventures with O the Owl and Katerina Kittycat.

It seems Toby and Carter are as indiscriminate about their choice of friends as the show's characters.

Carter's mother documents the pair's close bond in a series of online blog posts, which see Toby and Carter asleep in bed together, playing in the garden and even in the bath.

Loving: Carter and Toby are inseparable, according to the toddler's mother, Devin, who documents the pair's close bond in an online blog
