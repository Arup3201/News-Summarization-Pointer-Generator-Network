Alejandro Bedoya scored in the first-half as a youthful United States team started the four-year cycle of preparation for the 2018 World Cup with a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in Prague on Wednesday night.

Three players made their U.S. debuts, with 21-year-old forward Joe Gyau playing the entire match, 23-year-old defender Greg Garza coming on as a 63rd minute substitute and 18-year-old midfielder Emerson Hyndman entering four minutes later. Hyndman, a grandson of former FC Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman, made his debut last month with Fulham in the Championship.

Tim Ream, a 26-year-old defender who failed to make this year's World Cup squad, came on at the start of the second-half to play his first international game since October 2011.

Brad Guzan played the first-half as he took over as the Americans' No. 1 goalkeeper from Tim Howard, who is taking a year off from the national team. Guzan, who turns 30 on Sept. 9, was the oldest player in the U.S. starting lineup.

The only U.S. player over 30 was goalkeeper Nick Rimando, 35, who made several excellent saves in the second-half, including stopping Daniel Punil's point-blank shot with his leg in the final minute.

The U.S. was coming off its first consecutive appearances in the World Cup's knockout rounds; the Americans were eliminated by Belgium after a 2-1 defeat in extra time in the round of 16 on July 1.

The only way is up! US coach Jurgen Klinsmann has targetted a semi-final finish at the 2018 World Cup

Leader of the pack: Sunderland misfit Jozy Altidore (front) captained the US for a second time

Coach Jurgen Klinsmann started just two players who began the match against Belgium: Bedoya and right-back Fabian Johnson. Forward Jozy Altidore made his first U.S. appearance since injuring a hamstring as the Americans opened the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Ghana. Altidore captained the Americans for only the second time.

Klinsmann told NBC Sports before the game his goal was to make the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup - a round the Americans last reached at the first tournament in 1930.

'Once you get out of the most difficult group in the World Cup, you should go further than just (the) round of 16,' he said. 

'This is our goal going towards Russia, not to stop at the round of 16, maybe not to stop at the quarterfinal, to say clearly, listen: We have four years to prepare this cycle. Our goal is going into a semifinal in a World Cup. And that means a lot of work, a lot of competition, a lot of grind.'

Playing for keeps: Former Chelsea No 1 Petr Cech's clearance led to the US goal

The U.S. went ahead when goalkeeper Petr Cech, dropped from Chelsea's starting lineup by manager Jose Mourinho, sent the ball upfield to Vladimir Darida. 

Mix Diskerud stripped the midfielder before seeing his blocked shot ricochet to Bedoya, who scored with a left-footed shot for his second goal in 33 international appearances.
