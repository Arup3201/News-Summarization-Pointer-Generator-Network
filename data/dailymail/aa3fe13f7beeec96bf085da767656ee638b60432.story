A graphic designer confessed to a friend she hoped her mother 'dies soon' a year before she plotted to poison her in a Breaking Bad-style plot, a court heard.

Kuntal Patel, 37, is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly toxin after the 60-year-old 'forbade' her from marrying her boyfriend, Niraj Kakad.

The phials of poison, ordered from the US, came hidden inside a candle, but the parcel was tracked by the FBI prompting a swoop by counter terrorist officers on Patel's home, Southwark Crown Court heard.

 Mrs Patel, a magistrate who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court in Bow, east London, drank the poison last December, but survived. 

Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Patel duped her close friend Julie Wong into having the package containing the deadly poison, which she had bought online using Bitcoins, delivered to her home in Streatham, south London.

She pretended it was a romantic gift of an expensive candle from Mr Kakad, who she had met on a dating site, which she did not want her mother to discover.

Ms Wong told London’s Southwark Crown Court that Patel, who she had known since university, was bullied and beaten by her mother, who was determined to break up her relationship.

The court heard that in a series of increasingly desperate emails and texts, Patel confided in her friend about the 'relentless' abuse and violence she suffered at her mother’s hands.

In one message in August 2012 she said: 'My life is so messed up right now, I actually wish I was dead or wish my mum died. I hate her so much.'

The following month, on September 24, she messaged Ms Wong again about her mother, saying: 'She got what she wanted, ruining my life. She should be happy. She blatantly said to me "I don’t care if you’re unhappy because I made the right decision".

Friends: The court heard that Patel told her friend Julie Wong (left) that she wished her mother was dead, and told another pal Darcia Babb (right) that her mother was a 'psycho', and she was afraid she might kill herself

'She keeps bringing it up, I don’t. She just sits on the sofa crying, I hope she dies soon.'

Shocked, Ms Wong had replied: 'Oh f*** Kuntal, you didn’t just say that?'

Patel shot back: 'What, it is true. I’m sorry, I won’t talk about it. It’s killing me. I really miss Niraj and we would have been really happy together.'

Peter Rowlands, defending, said Patel’s mother inflicted a 'war of abuse and physical violence' on her daughter, who lost weight and became suicidal under the strain.

Patel, who worked as a graphic designer for Barclays Bank, complained that her mother banned her from seeing her boyfriend and beat her.

In an email in July 2012 she confided in an email to Ms Wong that her mother beat her.

She wrote: 'I can’t hit her back. My life is so worthless I just sit and take it because I deserve it and my life is not going to change at all.

'She just sits and shouts at me like a bulldog. No reason or logic apart from being a psycho.'

Ms Wong said Patel sent her photographs of her bruised arm after her mother hit her.

She told jurors that Patel had been hit by her mother 'a few times', adding: 'There was one time she sent me a picture message. It was of bruising on her arm. She said it was caused by her mother.'

Ms Wong said her close friend became increasingly depressed and her weight plummeted in the two years before the alleged poisoning.

She encouraged her friend to break free of her mother’s stranglehold, and said she had no suspicions when she asked her to accept a package for her at her home last November.

Patel initially told her the package was a watch which Mr Kakad was posting to her from America.

But when the black A3-sized package arrived at Ms Wong’s neighbour’s house on December 10 last year, Patel changed her story and said it was an expensive candle.

Ms Wong said: 'She told me it was a candle given to her from Niraj. It was a memory for her. It was a very expensive candle.

Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Patel (pictured in a court sketch) duped her close friend Julie Wong into having the package containing the deadly poison, which she had bought online using Bitcoins

'They were at a hotel one time, she liked this candle, he remembered it and bought her one.'

Mr Rowlands told jurors that Patel had an extremely strained relationship with her mother, who 'treated her like a child' and gave her curfews.

The day before the package arrived she had told Ms Wong she was desperately unhappy and considering 'killing herself', jurors heard. 

After Kuntal bought the substance from American Jesse Korff, the FBI tracked the sale to London, and alerted British counter terrorism police, jurors heard.

Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, said: 'The order of event is information was received from the American authorities on January 25, 2014.

'A search was carried out at two addresses in Wyatt Park Road in Streatham - these are the addressees of James Sutcliffe and Julie Wong.'

Specialist officers trained in chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear substances then searched Kuntal's home.

DC Simon Thomas from the Met's Counter Terror command said: 'Due to the nature of the substances we were seeking, we had CBRN officers trained for dealing with chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear material.

'They wore protective equipment.'

He added that their main concern was if there was 'any immediate threat from the substance or people in the address'.

DC Thomas told the court that when Kuntal's East London home was raided on January 26, this year, she claimed not to have known there was anything inside the candle she received.

When asked by him what had arrived in the package, Kuntal allegedly said: 'It was just a candle that I ordered. I don't have it because it was destroyed in the post - the glass smashed.'

DC Thomas asked her where it had been ordered from, why it had been sent to Ms Wong's address and why she bought it.

The graphic designer for Barclays in Canary Wharf replied: 'Online - I can't remember. Because I wasn't available at home, she was.

'It was like a surprise gift - a present. I was going to give it to my mum.'

She also told police that because the glass had smashed she threw the candle away in the dustbin.

Kuntal was initially arrested on suspicion of keeping the drug without permission.

Jurors also heard from Darcia Babb, Kuntal's best friend of 20 years and a detective constable with the Met's Trident unit.

She said in a string of emails she was told by Kuntal that she 'could not live without' Mr Kakad and she had confronted her mother but was told 'over my dead body'.

Upon reading this, Ms Babb replied: 'Make a decision, are you going to stay there or leave. I fear she is going to kill you.'

Responding to this, Kuntal said: 'You don't know what she is capable of, she is psycho. She will go all out to ruin me or anyone associated with me.

'I am scared now my mum will kill herself.'

Later, DC James Galvin, who questioned Patel over three days, read the interview transcripts to the court, and said she had described her mother as 'quite healthy', despite suffering with high blood pressure.

She had said: 'I still don't agree with how she has dealt with it [her engagement] but at the end of the day she is still my mother.'

She went on to claim she bought the poison to kill herself, after seeing at TV documentary. 

'That's when things started going in my head - will this be good to probably use,' she had said.

'It is just something you could just drink and just die from.' 

Patel told the police the poison arrived in a candle, but the glass shell had smashed so she threw the contents away.

'It was a candle and the glass had smashed. I was quite scared so I threw it away.'

She added she had spent between £600 to £900 on the product.

Patel said she had been 'fairly desperate and wanted to find a way out'.

'I didn't want my mum and my sister to open it', she explained.

'I think the lid of the jar was on but the surrounding jar had all smashed....when I opened it I saw the glass was everywhere.'

Patel went on to deny she had ever suffered mental health problems and stated she was no longer feeling suicidal.

US series Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as chemistry teacher Walter White, who cooks crystal meth to fund his cancer treatment. He kills a character using poison. Earlier in the trial the court heard that Patel called the man who sold her the poison ‘Heisenberg’ – White’s alias.

Patel, of Plaistow, east London, denies trying to murder her mother and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She has pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin last December.

The trial continues.
