Dozens of men were yesterday charged with a wide range of sex crimes against vulnerable girls after two separate police investigations.

Following a ‘milestone’ operation by Northumbria Police, 20 suspects appeared in court to face charges including rape, sexual assault and sex trafficking.

The alleged offences involved 12 victims, including one girl who was aged just 13, with officers vowing to continue their investigation into the abuse of vulnerable children.

Dozens of men were yesterday charged with a wide range of sex crimes against vulnerable girls after two separate police investigations

In a separate case, 25 men from Halifax, West Yorkshire, were charged with a number of historic and child-related sex offences.

Almost all of the men in both cases are from Asian backgrounds, prompting police leading one of the cases to warn that far-Right groups may use the issue to stir up racial tension.

Northumbria Police launched Operation Sanctuary when two women walked into a police station 13 months ago and made a number of allegations.

A total of 31 suspects have already been charged as part of the operation.

The victims associated with the latest charges are aged between 13 and 25.

The accused men appeared at Bedlington magistrates’ court yesterday to be charged with a long list of offences including arranging child prostitution, false imprisonment and supplying Class A drugs.

Deputy Chief Constable Steve Ashman, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Today marks a milestone in this operation. Since the first allegations were made over a year ago we have painstakingly left no stone unturned. To date, this part of the investigation has involved speaking to over 100 potential complainants.

Pledge: Justice Goddard

The troubled inquiry into historical child sex abuse will not report back until at least 2018, the judge appointed to run it has said.

Lowell Goddard, who sits in New Zealand’s high court, insisted that she would not let the investigation into claims that Establishment paedophiles preyed on youngsters stretch out indefinitely.

She spoke out amid anger that there is still no publication date for the Iraq Inquiry six years after chairman Sir John Chilcot began taking evidence on the build-up and consequences of the war.

Justice Goddard, who was appointed by Home Secretary Theresa May, said she would ensure the inquiry did not risk running out of control by setting ‘achievable goals’ from the outset. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘An inquiry that drags on and does not have achievable goals, that cannot deliver is not an effective inquiry and I’m interested in conducting a very effective inquiry.’

The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, political parties, charities, the Church, the BBC, public and private schools and the Armed Forces, failed to protect children.

Justice Goddard, 66, was appointed after two previous chairmen were forced to resign over family links or friendships with people whose past actions were criticised.

The inquiry was set up in July amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s.

Asked if she felt equipped to take on the Establishment, Justice Goddard said: ‘I’m a judge so that’s not a new thing for me.’

‘Operation Sanctuary will not end. It is a wide-ranging investigation into many different crimes of a sexual nature against vulnerable women and girls. Today’s charges are just one element of this.’ He continued: ‘Some people or groups may try to use Operation Sanctuary to build resentment. Anyone experiencing hate crime should report it to police and be reassured we will investigate thoroughly.’

The alleged offences in Halifax are said to have taken place between 2006 and 2011 and involved two victims – but predominantly one girl who was under 16 at the time. The charges include rape, people trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexual activity with a child under 16, voyeurism and sexual assault.

All 25 of the accused men, aged between 23 and 42, were charged at Halifax Police Station on Wednesday and have been released on bail.

They will appear before Calderdale magistrates’ court on February 12.

The 20 men charged in connection with Operation Sanctuary were either bailed or remanded in custody before appearing at Newcastle Crown Court on February 16 and 17.
