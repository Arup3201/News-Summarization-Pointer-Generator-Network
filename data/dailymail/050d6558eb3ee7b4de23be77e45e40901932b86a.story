Drowned: Nigel Veitch, 49, from Ascot, Berkshire, worked as a senior phytochemist within the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew, west London

A leading Kew Gardens scientist was found drowned in the sea off the coast of Cornwall, police said today.

Nigel Veitch, 49, from Ascot, Berkshire, was discovered in the water between St Ives and Pendeen by the captain of a pleasure 
boat.

Dr Veitch, who worked as a plant chemist, was described by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as an 'outstanding scientist'.

Sam Narbett, of Bluefin Charters, was taking holidaymakers on a fishing trip on the morning of 1 September when he saw Dr Veitch's body.

He said: 'I was just streaming along out fishing and I caught a glimpse of 
something in the water.

'As I went past I realised it was a person. My 
first thought was it could have been a fisherman that went over the 
side. He was face-down in the water.

'I thought it might have been 
someone knocked unconscious, so I pulled him on board.

'My initial 
reaction was that we might have a chance of saving him. People can 
survive a long time in cold water.'

An off-duty policeman and an 
undertaker, who were two of the holidaying passengers on board the boat,
 checked for signs of life but discovered the man was already dead.

He 
was brought ashore to Smeaton’s Pier in St Ives. Police later said his death was not being treated as suspicious.

Kew Gardens today paid tribute to Dr Veitch, who worked as a senior phytochemist within the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew, west London.

A spokeswoman said: 'We are deeply saddened by Dr Nigel Veitch’s death.

'Dr Veitch was a valued colleague and friend to many at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and an outstanding scientist.

'He was a gifted plant chemist with a long-standing interest in flavonoid chemistry. In 2003 his specialist research into the flavonoid chemistry of legumes was recognised by The American Society of Pharmacognosy Foundation with the Jack L. Beal Award.

'He also made a key contribution as the 
phytochemistry expert to the series Genera Orchidacearum, the final 
volume of which was published earlier this year.

'He was well known across the organisation for his musical talent and led the Kew choir at the annual staff Christmas carol service.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues.'

Dr Veitch gained his doctorate at the University of Oxford in 1992 and joined Kew Royal Botanic Gardens that year.

He was also a visiting lecturer at the 
School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, from 1997 to 1999 
and a member of the editorial board of Biochemical Journal.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police today appealed for information about the death.

He asked for anyone who may have seen Dr Veitch in the West Cornwall area between midday on August 31 and September 1 to contact the force on 101.
