Aside from a penchant for nuclear testing, Iran and North
Korea share one rather peculiar statistic in common, still standing as the only
two nations that Cristiano Ronaldo has scored against at the World Cup.  

In 2006 against Iran, it was a penalty kick. In 2010 against
North Korea, it was the sixth goal in a 7-0 win for Portugal.

For a player
who many hail as the greatest of his generation, Ronaldo’s World Cup record
stands out as a troublesome blot on his copybook. Two goals in 12 World Cup
appearances for Ronaldo, neither of them decisive, stands as one of the
inexplicable enigmas of the modern game.

Despair: Cristiano Ronaldo's record at the World Cup finals is a blot on his copybook

Cut: Cristiano Ronaldo sports his new mop style in training for Portugal ahead of their Ghana clash

Double: He only has two goals at World Cups, one of which was a penalty against Iran in 2006

Poor: Ronaldo's only other goal came in 2010 - it was the sixth in a 7-0 win over North Korea

In Brazil, Ronaldo has had his moments, the highlight that
majestic, curling cross to create a last-minute equaliser against the USA but
such has been the quality of this glorious World Cup, it is just one of a
gallery of breath-taking snapshots.

Ronaldo is just one comet in a galaxy of
superstars, his contribution no greater than Joel Campbell of Costa-Rica or
Enner Valencia of Ecuador, perhaps even less.

More acutely, it will not have escaped the Portuguese
captain’s attention that his old friend Lionel Messi is producing perhaps his
best performances yet in an Argentina shirt, striking four goals in the group
stages to Ronaldo’s none.

On the world’s greatest stage, the world’s greatest
player has been lowered into the realm of the mortals, offering only fleeting
glimpses of the inspiration that saw him reclaim the Ballon d’Or from Messi. It
will rankle that the column inches, the social media chatter and the radio
phone-ins are pitting Messi against the Brazilian sensation Neymar, arching
away from the Ronaldo-Messi narrative that has captivated football supporters
worldwide for so many years.

Hopes: Ronaldo held the aspirations of a nations on his shoulders for this World Cup and is yet to deliver

This has, it must be said, been a month of complications and
frustration for Ronaldo. There is medical mitigation for his struggles. A
physical phenomenon all season long for Real Madrid, Ronaldo has now been
hampered by injury issues, limping out of training and constantly applying ice
to relieve the pain.

One Spanish newspaper went as far as to suggest that the
29-year-old had been told by doctors that Ronaldo was risking his career by
playing with the recurring knee injury which is causing so much angst. A
Portuguese publication denied it but the white bandage strapped around his left
knee  is more than decoration.

Against Ghana on Thursday evening, with Portugal facing a
must-win ninety minutes and relying on improbable favours from elsewhere, it is
not unfeasible that this could be Ronaldo’s last involvement at the world’s
elite competition.

In Russia in 2018, he will be 33. Question marks will
emerge. Will he still possess that blistering pace? Does he have the desire to
toil on with this lamentable Portugal squad into his mid-thirties?

Swansong? Ronaldo is 29 and will be 33 by the time of the next World Cup so may not feature

‘Maybe we are an average team,’ Ronaldo commented on Sunday
evening, in a frank and damning assessment of a group that appears to rely
almost exclusively on his talents. If it was not for Ronaldo’s display of
individual wonder against Sweden in the play-offs, they simply would not be in
Brazil.

The deference, though, approaches almost spiritual levels,
with Portugal looking to Ronaldo on every occasion in the final third. It is a
familiar tale as Ronaldo falls into that old trap, offering grimaces of dismay
to the exasperating Manchester United winger Nani and attempting to rectify his
team’s limitations by doing it all by himself.

The preening peacock’s
feathers have re-emerged, with Ronaldo almost too desperate to impress, too
eager to make his statement before the global audience.

Off target: Ronaldo has tried to score this World Cup but has been unable to find the back of the net

It seems churlish to criticise this outstanding talent, who
has hit numbers in excess of fifty goals each season for the last four years
for club and country, yet some will wonder – particularly in his own country –
why Ronaldo’s brilliance is yet to be transplanted onto the grandest stage.

Ronaldo will privately wonder the same and in Brasilia
this evening, he may be entering his final opportunity to receive the adoration
he craves so much on the global stage.
