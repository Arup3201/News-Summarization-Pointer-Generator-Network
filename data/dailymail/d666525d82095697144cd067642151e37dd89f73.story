Sinea Nijjer, 20, is accused of falsely imprisoning a man while he was held at knifepoint and put through a degrading ritual

A man who claims he was 'tortured' by a prostitute and two men told a court today how he feared his genitals would be mutilated.

The alleged victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - says he was held at knifepoint by two men who ambushed him as he went to visit a prostitute in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

The man, who had pretended to be a footballer to impress 20-year-old Sinead Nijjer, claims he was lured to her flat by suggestive text messages, then jumped by her accomplices.

Rico Awad, 21, and Leam Ryan, 22, allegedly held a knife to his throat, then forced him to perform press-ups naked on the floor before putting on women's underwear and kissing Nijjer's feet.

He was later told to scrub his own face with a toilet brush and deliver an embarrassing 'confession' to an iPad, which the men used to film the entire ordeal, Aylesbury Crown Court heard.

The alleged victim said that he only escaped by exaggerating his mild breathing difficulties so that his captors panicked and called an ambulance.

He added that a fourth man attempted to persuade him to drop the case by offering £1,500.

However, Nijjer and the other accused deny holding the man prisoner, claiming instead that he refused to pay for a sex session, and invented the blackmail claims to save face.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the man told how he pretended to be a semi-professional footballer to impress Nijjer.

He said he went to her flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghashire, in July last year and paid £50 for oral sex, which he had done once before.

The man claims that after arriving at her flat for a third encounter, he was grabbed by the neck and pushed against the wall by a man as Nijjer walked into her bedroom.

'Lured': The victim said he had visited Nijjer twice before and was tempted over by text messages - before being grabbed by two men

Denial: Nijjer and the other accused claim the alleged victim in fact asked for a dominatrix session - then refused to pay

He asked what was going on and was told 
to shut up, noticing there was a second man in the flat holding a 
kitchen knife and wearing a balaclava.

'He said "I’m going to cut you up",' the man told the jury.

'The black guy said to me "take your clothes off". I thought maybe they’re going to cut my penis off.'

After being forced to apologise to Nijjer for disrespecting her, the man was put on the floor and told he was going to be 'taught a lesson'.

Ordeal: The man claims he was made to do press-ups naked on the floor and kiss Nijjer's feet

'The man said if you do what we tell you then you won’t get hurt,' said the alleged victim.

'I was kissing her feet for maybe 15 seconds. She took a sip of her drink and sprayed it all over me.'

The man, a Muslim, said he was made to read a statement to the camera explaining that even though it was Ramadan he was going to see prostitutes rather than praying at a mosque.

'They were getting a buzz out of the whole thing,' said the man. 'They were laughing all the way through. I was scared.'

Accused: Rico Awad is one of two men accused of forcing the ordeal on the alleged victim and falsely imprisoning him

The victim told the court: 'He said if you don’t we’re going to expose these pictures of you. He said all of these will go out and your whole family will be ashamed and your community will be embarrassed.'

The man then began to have breathing difficulties, causing his alleged captors to panic. He decided to exaggerate the problem and asked for an inhaler, even though he did not use one.

As the group became more panicked, one of the men allegedly told the victim: 'I’m a Muslim too. After all this is finished we are going to go to the mosque together and forget all of this happened. Just don’t die on me.'

Eventually an ambulance was called and the man was able to alert a paramedic.

Nijjer, 20, from Aylesbury, Rico Awad, 21, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire and Leam Ryan, 22, of no fixed address, claim they never harmed the victim or held him hostage, instead claiming he refused to pay for a domination session with Nijjer.

In cross-examination, the man was asked whether he had spent an hour-long session with Nijjer before declaring 'I'm not paying'. But he denied that version of events, which he said was 'incorrect'.

Nijjer, Award and Ryan deny charges of false 
imprisonment, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without 
consent, robbery, blackmail and common assault.

A fourth man, Mohammed Awan, 22, of Aylesbury, denies intending to pervert the course of justice after allegedly offering the victim £1,500 pounds to drop the case.

The trial, which is expected to last until the end of the week, continues.
