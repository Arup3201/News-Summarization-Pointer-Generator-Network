That also happened to be her 90th birthday.

The Scott Township man received the honor from the Laurel Highlands Boy Scout Council and the National Eagle Scout Association.

The award was established in 1969 for those who have been Eagle Scouts for more than 25 years and continued to demonstrate outstanding career achievement. 

Fewer than 2,200 people have received the award, including Neil Armstrong and Steven Spielberg.

Queneau was believed to be one of the country's oldest living Eagle Scouts

The former steel specialist and U.S. Navy veteran volunteered at Meals on Wheels, a local library and worked as an escort at St. Clair Hospital.

Describing her husband, Mrs Queneau said: 'He was such a special man.

'He excelled at everything. He was a high achiever. He was a treasure, and it's going to be very lonely going on without him.'
