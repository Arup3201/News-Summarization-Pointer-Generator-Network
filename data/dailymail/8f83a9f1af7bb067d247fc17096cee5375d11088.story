President Barack Obama says Americans have much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

In a holiday edition of his weekend radio and Internet address, Obama gives thanks for the country's founders, the generations who followed, and members of the military, and their families, for the sacrifices they make.

He expresses gratitude for the freedoms service members defend, including speech, religion and the right to choose America's leaders.

He also has kind words for those who work to make America a more compassionate place.

Obama says Americans are greater together than they are alone. He says togetherness is what every day, including Thanksgiving, should be about.

In the Republican address, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham pays tribute to service members spending the holiday away from home, and their families.

Troops lined up for traditional turkey, sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for a taste of home in Kabul.

Before getting stuck into their American-style meal, the troops prayed at the dinner table and reflected on what they are thankful for in 2013.

Nearly 47,000 U.S. soldiers are in Afghanistan, but it isn't clear how many will still be there next year, after troops start to be pulled out.

However, earlier this month, Afghan security deals revealed plans for military forces to stay on indefinitely in Afghanistan- costing the taxpayer tens of billions.

The wide ranging document outlined plans to stay on until 2024 'and beyond' - maintaining bases in Afghanistan and paying to support and train hundreds of thousands of Afghan security forces.

Afghan officials hope that up to 15,000 American troops will remain in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawl date as the United States faces a never-ending war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the war torn nation.Â
