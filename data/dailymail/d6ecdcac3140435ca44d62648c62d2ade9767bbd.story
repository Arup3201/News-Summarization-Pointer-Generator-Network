Record numbers of health-conscious men now take vitamins every day, according to new figures out today

Cod liver oil, omega-3, zinc and magnesium – sales of strange-tasting supplements are booming.

And the surge is being caused by record numbers of men worried about their health and appearance, according to figures published yesterday.

The report, compiled by analysts Mintel, found that the UK market for dietary supplements aimed directly at men grew by 25 per cent last year, from £4.1million to £5.1million.

Although they have traditionally been the preserve of children, pregnant women and the elderly, supplements are now being regularly taken by 38 per cent of men, close behind the number of women, on 46 per cent.

Men's health supplements usually contain vitamins A and D as well as zinc and magnesium which boost bone strength and help with memory loss and prostate problems.

The market for vitamins and supplements aimed at men has seen the biggest growth of all sectors in the past few years, said Mintel.

A spokesman said: ‘Despite the rise in sales of men’s vitamins, the number of male-specific launches remains fairly low in this category.

‘Taking greater confidence from maintaining a well-groomed appearance now defines what it is to be a “man” in today's society.

‘Men who buy grooming products to boost self-esteem or feel more attractive are now in the majority, however, there have been few vitamin launches targeted at men, particularly when it comes to vitamins with appearance benefits.

Nearly four in 10 men take vitamins or supplements on a regular basis, prompting a 25 per cent boom in sales in the past year

‘As 27 per cent of men agree that 
vitamins and supplements are important for improving your appearance, 
this market has great potential.’

The report found that 42 per cent of all adults regularly take vitamins or supplements to boost their health.

Women are the higher users of vitamins and supplements, with 46 per cent taking them on a daily basis.

One in five men have taken vitamins 'occasionally' in the past 12 months, mostly when they are feeling run down.

Thirteen per cent of men have taken cod liver oil on the same basis, 15 per cent vitamin D and 14 per cent fish oil or omega-3.

Men say they take vitamins to boost their health in general, 56 per cent to improve their immune system, 40 per cent to keep bones healthy and 24 per cent to boost energy levels.

Fourteen per cent take vitamins to combat ageing and 22 per cent to improve their brain function and memory.
