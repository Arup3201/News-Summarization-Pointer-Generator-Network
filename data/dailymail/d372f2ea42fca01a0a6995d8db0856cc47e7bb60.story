From ice cream vans to hot rods, speedboats and horses, teenagers heading to their school prom are no longer happy to settle for a lift in the family car, as these incredible pictures show.

With the end of the annual round of exams upon us, teenagers all over the country are celebrating the end of revision and swotting with glamorous American-style balls.

But it seems even the humble limousine is no longer enough for pupils at one Somerset school who came up with some impressively elaborate ways of arriving in style.

Mr Whippy anyone? Pupils Shaun Summers and Beckie Gardner, both 16, arrive at the Wadham school prom at Haselbury Mill in Crewkerne, inside an an ice cream van

Bright: While Shaun Summers, and Beckie Gardner's ice cream van might not have been the most luxurious mode of transport in sight, it was certainly the most colourful

The
name's boat, James Boat: Josephine Whitehead, Jamie Spicer, Connor 
Harris, Alex Jackson, and Aoife Gray arrive in their 007 themed 
speedboat

Would Q approve? The boat, the provocatively named Jealousy, was towed to the prom on a trailer - possibly not quite as M would have planned it

up! Students Kitty Rochford, 16, and Abbie Ryall, 15, arrive at the 
Wadham school prom by more traditional means courtesy of a pair of 
dapple grey horses

Saving the pennies: These teenagers arrived crammed into the back of a farm Land Rover and squeezed onto their family's sit-on lawnmower

Last year, a pair of girls studying at Wadham School in Crewkerne, Somerset made headlines after they arrived as Barbie dolls inside a 
perfectly-packaged display box and it would appear that this year's crop
of 16-year-olds are just as fond of the limelight.

Among pupils set on making a splash at their prom were those who turned up on horseback, in vintage cars, a speedboad that played the James Bond theme and a Hell's Angel-style trike.

Arriving in the speedboat, the aptly named Jealousy, was Josephine Whitehead, 16, from Illminster, who was accompanied by her friends Jamie Spicer, Connor Harris, Alex Jackson, and Aoife Gray.

She said: 'Last year some a couple of people turned up dressed as Barbie inside a box, so we wanted to do something memorable as well.

'We thought outside the box and thought a speed boat would be quite a cool idea, so we borrowed one from a friend. We arrived with a James Bond playlist on in the background, with the songs from Casino Royale and Goldfinger.

'Everyone seemed to react well to it and it was a really good night.'

Others plumped for a pair of dapple grey horses and a vintage campervan, while some called on their parents to fund grand entrances made in luxury sports cars.

Not everyone went crazy with the parental credit card however. Four boys arrived squeezed into the back of a battered farmyard Land Rover, while another pair chose to make an entrance on the family sit-on lawnmower.

Art teacher Charlotte Sneath, 25, who organised the prom at Wadham School in Crewkerne, Somerset, said: 'It [the flamboyant display] seems to be part of it now.

'What they arrive in and how they dress is what the kids get excited about. They try and out-do each other, but they all looked great and had a great time.'

The big event: The students' prom night included supper and a disco in Hazlebury Mill close to Wadham School where they took their GCSEs

Dramatic: One student plumped for a violet and cream vintage car complete with a pair of yellow eyes for their grand entrance at their school's prom night

Luxury: This couple managed to get their hands on a vintage van, complete with a suited and booted chauffeur and an assistant to open the doors

Slick: Clara Fowler and Katie Fitzsimmons, both 16, got a lift in the parental Porsche to the prom while others cadged a ride in the family Bentley

Easy rider: This young chap chanelled his inner Hells Angel and cadged a lift on the back of his father's electric blue hot rod motorcycle

Going for glamour: This elegant young couple hoped their vintage car would ooze Hollywood but were foiled by the Seasick Steve lookalike behind them

Unconventional: These girls plumped for a vintage duck egg blue camper van festooned with pretty ribbons and bows

Vrrrrroooom! Meryl Toogood, 16, and Shane Kennard, 17, decided to take a slightly battered looking hot rod rally car to their school prom in Somerset

Proud: Despite the large financial outlay required, parents congregated outside the prom to enjoy the sight of their colourfully dressed offspring and their lavish cars
