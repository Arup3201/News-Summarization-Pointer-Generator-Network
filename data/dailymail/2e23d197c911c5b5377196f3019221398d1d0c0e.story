This is the hilarious moment a police car joined in with Halloween festivities by 'knocking down' a group of partygoers who were dressed as bowling pins.

The footage, which has been viewed millions of times around the world, shows the 11 men - each dressed in a £30 red and white skittle costume – approaching the marked police car making ghost noises.

Assembling in front of the vehicle, the police driver appears to realise the group's intentions and, in good spirits, slowly drives into the 'laid out pins' and bowls them over.

The comical scene, captured on CCTV cameras in Aberdeen has now gone viral and has attracted millions of viewers from as far as Australia and the U.S.

Steven Scouller, 26, from Portlethen in Aberdeenshire, was one of the 'skittles' in the video and said he was delighted with the police's reaction.

He said: 'It was all taken in good spirit. Most of the bars were happy with us going in and wanted us to get involved.

'I was delighted the police realised we were having a laugh and not causing any trouble and went along with it.

'Having a packed Belmont Street applauding us was slightly surreal. And now we just need to work out how to better it next year.'

The other skittles were Lee Stewart, 26, from Portlethen, Callum Wallace, 24, Sam Tulloch, 24, Bobby Ledingham, 24, Bobby Caldwell, 24, Stephen Gaunt 24, Douglas Ballantyne, 24, all from Aberdeen.

They were joined by Ewan Aitchison, 25, and Allan Silver, 24, both from Motherwell.

The crowd applauded as the police car scored a 'strike' when the skittles fell as the vehicle drove at them

Aberdeen City police officers appeared happy to show their fun side and even posted the CCTV footage of the life-size 'bowling game' on their Facebook page.

It currently has 5,644 likes and 725 shares.

South Aberdeen Area Commander Chief Inspector Graeme Mackie said: 'Aberdeen is a vibrant and safe city and we are pleased that revellers enjoyed themselves throughout the weekend in a light-hearted manner.

'It is encouraging to see this interaction between our officers and the public.

'Officers are keen to engage with the community in positive ways and it is no coincidence that interaction like that shown in the video resulted in few arrests and no serious assaults over the weekend.'
