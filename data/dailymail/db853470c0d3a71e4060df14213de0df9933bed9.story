Brilliant. I totally applaud Stuart Lancaster’s decision to try Manu Tuilagi on the right wing in Dunedin, even if it backfires and possibly costs England the Test.

It is the bold move of a coach who is deadly serious about winning the 2015 World Cup — and that really excites me.

The Luther Burrell-Billy Twelvetrees combination at centre was a big success last season and with both now fit and available it makes sense to reunite them.

But you want all your best players involved and Tuilagi is fresh, confident and playing well.

Bold move: Stuart Lancaster named Manu Tuilagi to start on the right wing

New Zealand away is the biggest Test in rugby and by the end of next week England will know if the experiment is worth pursuing.

What are the pluses? Tuilagi is a world-class strike runner but because he has to be closely marked at all times he can also be the perfect decoy. It is possible he will hardly touch the ball in Dunedin but indirectly contribute to two or three England tries.

Tuilagi may look nothing like Jason Robinson but tactically he provides the same threat because he is nigh on unstoppable one-on-one if he takes the ball at pace in the right area.

My dream scenario for Tuilagi would be any attacking England scrum anywhere from five to 25 metres out with a biggish blindside on the right. Put Tuilagi out there deep on his own and line up all the other backs going left.

All Danny Care would then need is a solid scrum or a slight wheel to help take the All Blacks’ back row out of the equation and it’s game on. A perfectly timed pass to Tuilagi at full tilt will leave only one defender to beat.

Jason Robinson once scored a beauty under the posts against France using the same move.

On the attack: Sir Clive Woodward believes Tuilagi can have a similar impact on the wing as Jason Robinson

New Zealand might put an extra man in defence on the blindside. In which case call their bluff and go left.

The predictable thing would have been to start Tuilagi at No 13 again but that is why I like this selection — the New Zealand back line will be starting from scratch in how to deal with him from the wing, while facing another threat in Burrell.

What are the negatives? Tuilagi doesn’t turn that quickly and although he may be competent under the high ball, you don’t get much practice in midfield. New Zealand’s tactical kickers, as well as testing him with a few bombs, will roll little grubbers behind him and get Tuilagi going backwards. Under pressure, he could make mistakes.

I enjoyed Lancaster’s frankness when questioned about Tuilagi’s aerial skills, saying Manu will thump anyone who beats him to the ball. It reminded me of when I first selected Jason Robinson at full back against Australia in 2001. 

Wrecking ball: The decision to pair Luther Burrell with Billy Twelvetrees at centre is a positive one

At 5ft 8in many doubted his ability under the high ball. I was sitting with Jason when he was asked how he was going to deal with that situation. ‘I’ll jump,’ was his response. Selection is about picking players for what they can do — not based on perceived weaknesses.

Tuilagi needs to stay alert. On the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980 I was moved from the centre to the right wing in the third Test. We led 10-6 with 10 minutes to go when Naas Botha kicked long into our 25 and I side-footed into touch.

Fatally, I turned my back as I jogged back into my unaccustomed position and the Boks struck. Gerrie Germishuys threw a quick line-out to Theuns Stofberg and although I got back to make a tackle he offloaded to Germishuys and they were in for a converted try.

We lost 12-10. Don’t switch off for a second. Especially if you are a centre who has just moved to the wing!
