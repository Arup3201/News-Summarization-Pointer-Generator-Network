The father of Malala Yousafzai has described how his entire family has been traumatized by the massacre of at least 132 children and 16 staff at a school in Peshawar, Pakistan.

Education campaigner Ziauddin Yousafzai called the attack the 'extreme of extremism' and told how his wife Tor Pekai collapsed into unconsciousness for 15 minutes after hearing news of the attack.

He added that he has never seen his Nobel Peace Prize-winning daughter Malala, 17, 'so sad and upset' after details of the slaughter emerged, adding that his family members' 'hearts are bleeding'.

Mr Yousafzai's comments came as local media attacked the Pakistani government for the atrocity, saying Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has wasted time trying to win the cooperation of the Taliban rather than cracking down on the group's terrorist activities.

Horror: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has released a statement condemning the attack as 'atrocious and cowardly' adding: 'I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror'

Mr Yousafzai condemned yesterday's sickening slaughter of children at a school in Peshawar and said it was an unprecedented attack in Pakistan.  

'Peshawar has been witnessing this kind of terror for the last many, many years, but what happened yesterday has no example in the history of Pakistan,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'When my daughter was attacked, the world turned into a dark hole for our family and I can imagine how much sadness and terror and horror the families will be passing through now,' he added.

'Schools should safe places for children... I'm afraid that if they [the Taliban] are not countered, we will see more horrible things in the future,' Mr Yousafzai went on to say.

His comments came just a day after his Nobel Peace Prize winning daughter Malala released a statement condemning the attack as 'atrocious and cowardly'.

'I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror in Peshawar that is unfolding before us,' she said. 

Malala added that she stood united with the government and armed forces of Pakistan, describing their efforts  to address the attack as 'commendable'.

Depraved: The Taliban gunmen who slaughtered 148 innocent people, including 132 children, are pictured just hours before the massacre. The white banner they pose in front of is the flag of the Pakistani Taliban and reads: 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger’

In disguise: The photographs show the six heavily armed men wearing everyday clothing - a chilling disguise that meant security guards did not recognise them as being members of the Taliban

Armed: Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani the third image shows the same group of men wearing full military fatigues - an outfit that would outed them as Taliban to security guards

Terror leader: Maulana Fazlullah - the firebrand militant, whose thick black beard reaches halfway down his chest - took control of the Pakistani Taliban 13 months ago

Accused: Pakistani media has partially blamed the Pakistani government for the atrocity, saying Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (pictured) has wasted time trying to win the cooperation of the Taliban

Mr Yousafzai explained his fears over Pakistan's ability to counter the Taliban, saying that although political parties make comments pledging a united front against terror in the aftermath of such atrocities, these promises tend to fall apart once the reality and difficulty of doing so hits home.

'The Taliban doesn't know anything about condemnation. The more you condemn them, the worse they are, the more violent they are,' he said. 

His comments came as Prime Minister Nawaz declared that his government can no longer claim there are 'good' elements within the Pakistani Taliban and would now be targeting the group in its North Waziristan stronghold without discrimination. 

Dismissing claims that Pakistan had supported elements within the Taliban that it considered to be less of a security threat,  he said: 'No non-state actor is being backed by the government.'

His statement came after local media said the Pakistani government had to take some of the blame for the atrocity. 

An editorial in The Nation read: 'The truth is this: Not just terrorists, but everyone, from the wider population to the civil and military leadership is responsible for the barbarity our children were subjected to.'

The newspaper went on to accuse Nawaz of doing 'absolutely nothing towards building a narrative against extremism' and said he had no 'meaningful political ownership' of anti-Taliban operations.

The editorial also accused the Pakistani Army of refusing 'to employ a blanket policy against non-state actors and continuing 'to protect sectarian elements'.

Shocking: The scene of the final gun battle between the jihadists and Pakistani soldiers

Devastation: Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up during a nine-hour rampage 

Horror: This morning the first devastating images emerged of the blood-soaked classrooms where 132 innocent children and nine teachers were massacred by the Taliban

Elsewhere The Express Tribune appeared to criticise Imran Khan for having earlier proposed 'peace talks' with the Pakistani Taliban, adding that he had not effectively condemned the Taliban.

The newspaper referred to Khan as someone who had 'havered and equivocated, who offered mealy-mouthed justifications for appalling acts of terror.'

Another Pakistani newspaper, the Daily Times, said: 'There is no way the country and its leadership can let this one go; there is no way a solid, chapter-turning decision cannot be made after what is, no doubt, a national tragedy.'

'The government and military must understand once and for all that we are at war,' the newspaper added, demanding a 'a final end to this terror' following what it branded 'the blackest day we have ever lived through.'

This morning horrifying pictures emerged showing the Taliban gun squad who slaughtered the innocent children as it was revealed the terror group is planning more attacks at schools in Pakistan.

Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani, the photographs show six heavily armed men posing in front of a white Islamic banner shortly before the attack in Peshawar.

In an email released this morning, Khurasani attempted to justify the attack by claiming that said the Pakistani army has long killed the innocent children and families of Taliban fighters.

He vowed more such militant attacks and told Pakistani civilians to detach themselves from all military institution, adding: 'We are still able to carry out major attacks. This was just the trailer.' 

In the email, the terror group warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas. 

Three photographs of the murders were released by the Pakistani Taliban this morning.

The group are seen wearing full military fatigues and posing in front of a white banner daubed with religious slogans.  

Following the release of the photographs, authorities in the capital Islamabad issued a letter calling on schools to increase security and to check underneath buses and other vehicles.
