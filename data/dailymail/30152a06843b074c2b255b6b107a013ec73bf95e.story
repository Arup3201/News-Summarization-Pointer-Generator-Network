On any normal day you would be forgiven for raising a speculative eyebrow at scaremongers professing that the sky is caving in. But on Saturday it really did fall, as many star-gazers were lucky enough to see.

The first peak of the annual Lyrid meteor shower happened just after midnight, putting on an eye-catching display, visible across the world. 

NASA scientists tracked the shower with a network of cameras on earth, the International Space Station and a research balloon as they attempted to capture the display in 3D for the first time.

Sky show: This year's shower was better than in previous years because of a new moon setting darker skies and providing perfect conditions for meteor watching

This year’s show was better than in previous years because of a new moon setting darker skies and providing perfect conditions for meteor watching.

Bill Cooke, NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, told MSNBC: ‘The moon messes a lot of stuff. I like the moon … but it can keep us from getting work done.’

Technology: A 'Meteor Counter' iPhone app was created to allow members of the public to join in, counting the number of meteors and sending the data to NASA

At its fiercest there were between 15 
and 20 meteors every hour.  A ‘Meteor Counter’ iPhone app was created to
 allow members of the public to join in, counting the number of meteors 
and sending the data to NASA.

In past years rate has reached 
heights of 100-per-hour but Cooke warned wannabe-astrologers not to set 
their hopes to high and expect to see just a handful each hour.

In some areas the Lyrids were seen as well as heard. A loud explosion, likely caused by a meteor, was heard across Nevada and California at around 8am on Sunday morning, rattling windows and shaking houses.

Excited witnesses said they saw a fireball streak across the sky at the same time and experts said the reports indicated the meteor broke up somewhere over the Sierra southwest of Reno.

For those plagued by local cloud cover, unable to see the show themselves. Cooke
 hosted a ‘NASA up all night’ webchat to discuss the Lyrids in 
real-time and
 there is a second chance to see it. Tonight the shower is set to happen
 again, with its best display running from 11pm to 5am.

The Lyrids occur every year as a result of the Earth passing through debris left by Comet Thatcher, and the shower has been occurring for at least 2600 years. 

Specks of Thatcher’s dust hit the top of earth’s atmosphere at 110,000 mph and disintegrate in a flurry of meteors, enjoyed by spectators worldwide. 

The actual comet is far from earth at the moment – orbiting the sun once every 415 years – but debris from it has spread out along its path, mostly pieces of dust or rock smaller than grains of sand. 

As the meteors push through the atmosphere they burn up 50 to 70 miles above the ground, producing a vivid display of light. 

Meteors best seen in places away from light pollution. Lyrids are typically about as bright as the stars of the Big Dipper, making them relatively easy to spot for the novice gazer. 

Giving advice to amateurs, Cooke said: 'The last thing you want to do is look at Lyra, which is the direction of the radiant, because the meteors in that direction have very short tails and will appear as a dot to you.

'The best thing to do with any meteor shower is to go out there, lie on your back and look straight up.’
