A video of an alleged Islamist fanatic said to be a former Arsenal player has been posted on a Jihadist website.

The footage, apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with radical militants.

The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching a AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus.

A video posted on an extremist website claims to be of a former Arsenal footballer now fighting in Syria

According to FiSyria.com, the site that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous footballer.

It claims the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving everything' to join the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Speaking in heavily-accented English, the man makes a tirade against the West and urges others to follow his lead and take up arms.

He says: 'I have some words of advice to give to you. My advice to you is that, first of all, we are in need of all types of help, from those who can help us in fighting the enemy. Welcome come and join us.

A spokesman for Arsenal say they have no record of a past player called Abu Isa al-Andalus, although it is thought the man may have changed his identity

He later adds: 'We have conquered 
many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where 
the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax.

'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it.

'If you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put your children in the kaffir schools. "Who is going to teach your children?" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a paedophile.

'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.'

The Russian-based website does not confirm the man's previous identity on the page, which shows two videos each roughly four-minutes long.

Text next to the video reads: 'He... played for Arsenal in London, and [then] left football, money and the European way of life to make the path of Allah.'

A spokesman for Arsenal said: 'We do not recognise the individual from the published clips and we donâ€™t have any record of a Mr Abu Iza Andalusi representing the club at any level.'

Senior security officials have said that at least 250 British-based 'extremist tourists' have gone to Syria to train and fight.

Director General of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) Charles Farr said earlier this year that the war in the country now presents 'the biggest challenge' since the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

Mr Farr said: 'Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11, because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict.'
