The mantra meditation involves repeating a sound repeatedly twice daily for up to 20 minutes

Transcendental Meditation, made popular by the Beatles during the flower power era of the 1960s, could cut heart attack rates by half, researchers claim.

The mantra meditation, which involves repeating a sound repeatedly twice daily for up to 20 minutes, lowers death rates from heart attack and strokes.

The relaxation technique was used by patients with heart disease during a nine year £2.25million trial at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Professor of Medicine Theodore 
Kotchen said: 'These findings are the strongest documented effects yet 
produced by a mind-body intervention on cardiovascular disease.

'The effect is as large or larger than major categories of drug treatment for cardiovascular disease.

'However, subjects were already taking standard medications and this effect was on top of that.'

It
followed 201 African-American men and women with an average age of 59 
who suffered from the narrowing of arteries in their hearts.

They were selected to do the Transcendental Meditation technique or to participate in a control group which received health education classes in traditional risk factors, including dietary modification and exercise.

Professor Kotchen said: 'In African American men and women with heart disease, Transcendental Meditation, a technique for stress reduction, decreased the likelihood of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke by 47 per cent.

'At the same time, study participants remained on their usual medications for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including anti-hypertensive agents and lipid-lowering medications.

'Consequently, meditation should be considered an adjunct, not a substitute, for usual medical care. Although provocative, these observations should be confirmed in other patient populations.'

The researchers did further analysis of two subgroups, those participants who had high compliance with the meditation program, and a high stress group, and found even greater reductions in death, infarction and stroke in those groups. 

The high compliance subgroup showed a 66 per cent reduction, while the high stress subgroup showed a 64 per cent reduction.

Co-author Dr Robert Schneider claimed the results are the strongest documented effects yet produced by a mind-body intervention on cardiovascular disease.

The findings were published in the American Medical Association's Archives of Internal Medicine.

At a press conference two years ago before a concert to promote Transcendental Meditation, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney recalled their 1968 trip to India to learn meditation from the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

'Over 40 years ago, we ended up in Rishikesh,' Starr said. 'That is where we hung out with Maharishi. We had met him a few months before in Wales. Since then, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, I have meditated. It’s a gift he gave me.'

McCartney added: 'It’s one of the few things anyone has ever given to me that means so much to me. For us, it came at a time when we were looking for something to stabilise us at the end of the crazy Sixties.'
