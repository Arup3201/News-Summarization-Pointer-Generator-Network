Winding up: Model Glenda Gilson and her brother Damien are facing jail over the alleged failure to provide financial statements in relation to the Gilson Motor Company Limited

Model Glenda Gilson is facing jail over the alleged failure to provide financial statements in relation to the liquidation of their luxury car sales company.

The 30-year-old and her brother Damien were at the High Court as directors of Gilson Motor Company Limited, which is being wound up at the request of the Revenue Commissioners.

Ms Gilson had filed a statement of affairs, but the liquidator is said to be unhappy about it.

Her brother also only handed his statement of affairs in court yesterday, citing a mix-up which led to a delay.

The company, which specialised in selling high-end cars, had clocked up more than 140,000 euro in unpaid taxes.

Last month, the siblings were threatened with prison if they did not comply with a court order requiring them to to submit a statement of financial affairs for the liquidator.

Ms Gilson - a former girlfriend of 
Irish rugby star and captain Brian O'Driscoll - was a non-executive 
director of the company as 'an accommodation' to her brother, according 
to the Irish Independent.

Damien Gilson was managing director of the Dublin-based company.

Gary
Lennon, of Lennon Corporate Recovery, told Ms Justice Mary Finlay 
Geoghegan he was 'very unhappy' with the contents of both statements.

The
judge ordered the liquidator to notify the pair in writing by tomorrow 
of the inadequacies in the statements to give them a chance to address 
them.

The case was adjourned until July 11.
