Liverpool are set to play two matches in Australia as part of this summer’s lucrative pre-season tour.

The Reds will return Down Under after the huge success of their first visit two years ago when they played in front of 95,000 supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

This time Adelaide and Brisbane are expected to be the destinations for Brendan Rodgers’ squad as they step up their preparations for the 2015/16 campaign.

Details have yet to be finalised but it’s likely to be a four-game, fortnight-long tour starting in July with Liverpool stopping off in Asia both en route to Australia and on the return journey.

Indonesia and China are the leading contenders to also host friendly fixtures.

A return to Indonesia was always on the cards with their national airline Garuda one of Liverpool’s key commercial partners. A crowd of 82,000 watched the Reds beat an Indonesia XI in Jakarta in July 2013. The alternative option to Indonesia is playing in the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur.

The Reds last visited China in 2011 when 35,000 saw Kenny Dalglish’s side beat Guandgdong Sunray Cave 4-3 in Guangzhou. This time Liverpool are expected to visit the city of Macau – 40 miles west of Hong Kong – instead.

Sources in Australia expect the matches Down Under to be officially announced early next month once contracts have been exchanged. 

Anfield officials have been in talks with various cities about staging matches but it appears that Sydney has lost out to Adelaide and Brisbane.

The game in South Australia would be played at the Adelaide Oval which is best known as a historic cricket venue. It boasts a capacity of 53,000 and has also hosted international rugby and football previously.

Brendan Rodgers' side are set to play two  games in Australia this summer just as they did two years ago

Last summer A-League outfit Adelaide United played La Liga side Malaga there in front of 23,000 and promoters know Liverpool would represent a much bigger draw.

The Reds would be the first Premier League club to visit the state of South Australia since Sheffield United in 1994. Liverpool are set to line up against either Adelaide United or a A-League All Stars XI.

Rodgers’ men will also head for the east coast of Australia to play in Brisbane, Queensland. State government officials have been heavily involved in negotiations to secure Liverpool’s visit. 

The venue is likely to be the 52,500-capacity Suncorp Stadium which is home to Brisbane Roar FC. Celtic and Everton have both played friendly matches there in the past six years. 

Liverpool toured America last summer - playing matches in Boston, Chicago, New York, Charlotte and Miami

It’s also home to rugby union side Queensland Reds and has hosted Socceroos matches in the past.

With no international tournament in 2015, the longer pre-season schedule allows the club to travel further afield and tap into the massive support they enjoy across Asia and Down Under.
