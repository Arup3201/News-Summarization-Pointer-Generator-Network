Britain’s Siobhan-Marie O’Connor picked up another silver medal in Doha on Saturday with a third second-placed finish in three days at the World Short Course Championships.

The 19-year-old finished over four seconds behind Katinka Hosszu in the final of the 200 metres individual medley, the Hungarian sensation touching in a new world record time of 2min 1.86sec.

Twenty four hours earlier, it had been Hosszu again pipping O’Connor for gold in the 100m medley final.
