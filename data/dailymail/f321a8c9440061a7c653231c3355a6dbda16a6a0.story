A baby boy found abandoned in Holland earlier this year has the same mother as a baby girl found in Germany in 2011, DNA tests have revealed.

The boy was found lying in grass wrapped in a white blanket in the city of Roermond some 110 miles south of Amsterdam, on June 18 this year.

Now DNA checks have revealed he has the same mother as a baby girl abandoned 62 miles away in Huerth, near the German city of Cologne in October 2011.

It is not yet clear whether they share the same father.

Dutch authorities, working with their German counterparts, have launched a hunt to track down the parents, but as yet do not know the identities.

The baby girl, who appeared to have parents of European origin, was only about two days old when she was thrust into the arms of a man recycling garbage, said Cologne prosecutors' office spokesman Daniel Vollmert.

At the side of a road, a man was unloading recycling into containers when another man approached him and said in broken German, 'Here, I found this', Mr Vollmert said.

He handed him the little baby girl, swaddled in a towel and blanket and then fled. Police were called, but they could never identify the man who abandoned the baby.

Both children are healthy and being cared for by foster families in the Netherlands and Germany, said Eugene Baak, a spokesman for the Dutch prosecutors who hope the new information will lead to tips from the public that could help authorities trace the children's biological parents.

It is not yet clear whether the siblings will, at some stage, be reunited.

'The possibility is being investigated,' Mr Baak said.

The girl's DNA was tested after she was abandoned and entered into a databank. That didn't help identify the mother, but Dutch authorities found that it matched the baby boy they found.

Mr Vollmert said it is still not even known whether the baby was voluntarily given up by the mother or taken away from her.
