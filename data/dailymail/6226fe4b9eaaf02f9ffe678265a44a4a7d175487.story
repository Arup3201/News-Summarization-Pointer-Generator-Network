Aung San Suu Kyi today proclaimed a triumph for the Burmese people as her party claimed to have won every single seat it contested in the weekend's historic elections.

Miss Suu Kyi, leader of the struggle against military rule in Burma for two decades, was one of 44 candidates her National League for Democracy Party (NLD) said had won seats.

Speaking to a crowd of cheering supporters at the NLD's headquarters in Yangon she called on all parties to support reconciliation and said the election marks a 'new era' for the country.

New era for Burma: Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi talks to supporters at the headquarters of her National League for Democracy party in Yangon today after announcing a sweep in yesterday's by-election

Time for change: Miss Suu Kyi called on all parties to work together for reconciliation in the country, which has been under military rule for decades

'It is not so much our triumph as a triumph of the people, who have decided that they must be involved in the political process of this country,' she said.

'We hope that this will be the beginning of a new era, when there will be more emphasis on the role of the people in the everyday politics of our country.

'We hope that all other parties that took part in the elections will be in a position to cooperate with us to create a genuinely democratic atmosphere in our nation.'

Her supporters burst into cheers and danced in the streets yesterday when the NLD declared that Miss Suu Kyi had pulled off the once-seemingly impossible and won a seat in Burma’s parliament.

The 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was lauded by the people after she beat two rival candidates in a by-election in Kawhmu, south-west of the main city, Rangoon.

Hope for the future: Miss Suu Kyi receives flowers from supporters as she leaves her party headquarters

Power to the people: She told supporters gathered in Yangon she hoped there would now be more opoprtunities for the people to be involved in the government of Burma

‘We won! We won!’ cried her supporters
as they danced and waved red party flags and declared that the people’s
victory had taught the old military-backed rulers a lesson.

Pro-democracy leader Miss Suu Kyi was 
married to the late British academic Dr Michael Aris and once lived in 
Oxford, but she has been under house arrest for almost 20 years in 
Burma.

There was no word from the ruling 
Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was formed by the 
military junta before it ceded power a year ago, or the Election 
Commission on the outcome of Sunday's ballots.

If confirmed, the sweep would mean the
NLD even won four seats in the capital, Naypyitaw, a new city built by 
the former junta where most of the residents are government employees 
and military personnel, who were expected to back the USDP, the 
parliament's dominant party.

Joyous scenes: NLD supporters turned out in force to cheer Miss Suu Kyi's victory - even though the result of the election is yet to be confirmed by Burma's electoral commission

Although her victory had yet to be 
officially confirmed by Burma’s election commission, her National League
for Democracy insisted that Miss Suu Kyi had won – and switched on neon victory 
signs at the party headquarters in Rangoon.

More than 1,000 supporters gathered 
outside the building to celebrate, many wearing T-shirts with Miss Suu 
Kyi’s picture on the front and the party’s fighting peacock on the back.

Yesterday’s by-election was held to fill only 45 seats in Burma’s 
664-seat national Parliament and will not change the balance of power. 
While civilian, it is still heavily controlled by retired generals.

Party officials had earlier projected it would win 40 of the 45 seats at stake.

Miss Suu Kyi and other opposition 
candidates will have almost no say even if they were to win all the 
seats they contested, but she has given hope to Burma’s poverty-stricken 
masses who have lived under military rule for 49 years.

Joy: National League for Democracy (NLD) supporters celebrate outside the party office as they watch unofficial results showing a strong return in Yangon

High hopes: NLD supporters cheer and brandish a portrait of their champion Ms Suu Kyi as unofficial results arrive

In the past protests against hardship 
have been met with ruthless crackdowns by the military. Hundreds, 
including monks, have died in clashes with troops in the streets. But 
according to her party Miss Suu Kyi’s place in parliament marks the 
start of reforms the people had been praying for.

Last night NLD officials suggested that she might become president, something that was once seen as impossible.

One party official, Myo Win, said: ‘There is more of a possibility of that now. The army has changed and are now more lenient.’

Hopeful: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (right) greets supporters as she travels across the Kawhmu constituency this morning. The polls have now opened, with the pro-democracy party leader standing for a seat for the first time

Popular: A supporter kisses Ms Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), as she visits polling stations in her constituency. She is expected to win the seat, but the significance of a victory will be largely symbolic

Winning hearts: Ms Suu Kyi carries a bouquet as she tours the villages of the Kawmhu constituency. The historical by-elections are seen as an important vote of confidence for the country as it continues on the road to political and diplomatic reform

Anticipation: Election officials sit as they wait for their polling station to open in the constituency where Ms Suu Kyi stands as a candidate

Votes open: An election official (left) smiles

Road to change: Myanmar villagers walk towards a polling station in the village of Wah Thin Kha, where Ms Suu Kyi spent last night

While many voters accepted that Miss 
Suu Kyi might not have much influence in parliament at this stage, one 
supporter, Go Khehtay, summed up the hopes of many when he said: ‘One 
day, I believe she’ll be able to bring real change.’

Mr Khehtay was speaking in the village
of Wah Thin Kha, in Miss Suu Kyi’s constituency, where earlier she had 
been mobbed by supporters when she visited a polling station. The 
community of 3,000 farmers is typical of villages in Burma, having no 
electricity or running water.

Burma, which has a population of 
60million and was once part of the British Empire, has endured years of 
economic sanctions imposed as a result of human rights abuses.

The EU and the U.S. have hinted that 
some of the sanctions could be lifted if the election was free and fair.

Ready: Election officials show an empty ballot box today, just before opening a polling station in Kawhmu township

Taking part: Burmese voters wait in line for a polling booth at a school in Wah Thin Kha, the village where Ms Suu Kyi spent the night before today's election

Miss Suu Kyi’s victory follows reforming moves by the government of 
President Thein Sein – a retired lieutenant general – which has freed 
political prisoners, signed truces with rebel groups and begun direct 
dialogue with her.

Miss Suu Kyi, known to younger 
supporters as Aunty Suu, said during polling that the vote had been 
anything but free or fair.

She said registered people had not found 
their names on voting lists, dead people were listed and squares on 
voting papers had been coated with wax so the ticks could be wiped off 
and the papers declared invalid.

But she has joined in the popular 
optimism, saying that her party was ‘determined to go forward because 
this is what our people want’.
