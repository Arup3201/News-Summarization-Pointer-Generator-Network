Refused: Edith de Lisle requested permission to disinter her parents ashes from St. John the Baptist Churchyard, Hungarton, Leicesterershire, near the family's Quenby Hall estate but was refused

When aristocrat Edith de Lisle had her parents’ remains interred in St. John the Baptist Churchyard, she thought nearby Quenby Hall estate would remain as the family seat for decades to come.

Unfortunately for Mrs de Lisle the collapse of the family cheese-making business, run from the 1,135 acre estate, left the family with little option but to put the 11-bedroom hall and estate on the market, for £11m.

But while the family may soon be relocating, the remains of Madam de Lisle’s parents, Frederick and Eva Krarup will not be, after the Church of England refused her permission to disinter their ashes and move them to the family burial ground 25 miles away.

A senior church court said allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make ‘unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial’.

They were buried at the churchyard in Hungarton, Leicestershire, less than a mile from the Jacobean Quenby Hall, after her mother died in 1995.

Mrs Krarup had been cremated in Madrid before her ashes were returned to England.

Her daughter had previously won the right to have her father’s ashes exhumed from his original burial site in Peru in order that her parents could be reunited in death.

Madam de Lisle wanted their ashes moved to the family burial ground at Mount St Bernard Abbey, near Whitwick, Leicestershire.

But in a written Consistory Court judgement, Chancellor Mark Blackett-Ord ruled she could not exhume her parents’ remains.

Selling up: The family have put the nearby Quenby hall estate on the market for £11million after the family-owned cheese-making business closed

In his judgement, he said Mr and Mrs Krarup’s remains had been ‘buried with care and consideration by Madam de Lisle in the consecrated churchyard where they now lie’.

Chancellor Blackett-Ord said: ‘Indeed, she must have gone to very considerable lengths to procure their removal to Hungarton from Peru and Spain.

‘What has really changed is the unfortunate probability that Quenby Hall will not survive as the centre of the lives of her descendants.

‘I have to say I consider this is a bad reason for justifying the removal of the ashes.’ 

He said it had been previously established that allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make ‘unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial’.

Built in 1627, Quenby Hall is considered the finest High Jacobean country house in Leicestershire.

Stilton cheese was first made at the hall – by the housekeeper – in the mid-18th century and the product was sold by her daughter who lived at the staging inn at Stilton, near Peterborough.

Unacceptable: A senior church court said allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make 'unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial'

Cheesemaking was revived at the Hall, which boasts seven reception rooms, a traditional courtyard and seven additional houses or cottages as well as four flats and associated farm buildings, by Madam de Lisle’s son, Freddie, 55, in 2005.

Production resumed at the estate in 
one of only six dairies licenced to produce the ‘King of Cheeses’, but 
the business closed down six years later owing to cash-flow difficulties
through over-expansion.

It went into administration in April 2011 after a buyer could not be found.

In
his written judgement Chancellor Blackett-Ord added: ‘Unfortunately, 
Frederick’s business at Quenby Hall was unsuccessful and the hall will 
have to be sold. It is clear this has been a great shock to the family.

‘Madam
de Lisle stated (in correspondence before the ruling) ‘the family will 
have to be uprooted from what they had come to view as their home for 
generations to come’.’

He expressed regret, but refused Madam de Lisle’s application.

Freddie de Lisle, who lives with wife Aubyn, 54, at the hall, said he could not comment on the ruling, or whether the sale of Quenby Hall was related to the liquidation of the dairy company.

An estate worker said he currently works as a headhunter, based in London.

His parents, Squire Gerard de Lisle, 72,and Madam de Lisle, 74, who live in a lodge house on the estate, were said to be abroad on holiday.

The Squire de Lisle bought Quenby in the early 1970s, to replace the family seat at Garendon Hall, near Loughborough, Leicestershire, which was demolished in 1964.

The property has been extensively restored and is a popular wedding venue, as well as location for feature films and period dramas.

The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillipps from London. In 1684, Sir Ambrose Phillipps spent some of his fortune acquired through his legal practice and place at court to buy Garendon for £28,000.

When his grandson, another Ambrose, died aged in 1737 aged just 30, the estate fell to his brother, Samuel, who later died without children.

Garendon passed to a cousin, Thomas March, who adopted the name Phillipps, then married Susan de Lisle.

Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and when he died in 1862, his son, another Ambrose, decided to adopt all the previous family names, becoming the impressively named Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.
