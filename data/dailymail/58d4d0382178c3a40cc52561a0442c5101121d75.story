A new 'liquid breakfast' drink which claims to contain more fibre than bran flakes has gone on sale.

The milk-based drink is targeted at those too time-pushed to eat breakfast, in a bid to provide a quick shot of nutrients on the run.

Called Liquid Fuel, it is said to be the first beverage to be sold in supermarket cereal aisles.

It is claimed the drink offers more fibre than a 30g serving of Bran Flakes and four times the protein found in two Weetabix.

But critics say that with the equivalent of 10 spoons of sugar, the drink isn't as healthy as it seems. 

Convenient: The breakfast drinks are said to contain more fibre than bran and more protein than eggs - but critics say they are loaded with sugar

The drink, which is pasteurised and sold in a carton - meaning it doesn't need to be refrigerated - is the first to appear alongside cereals in UK supermarkets.

It is made up of 50 per cent milk with other ingredients including soya protein, thickeners, vitamins, dried glucose syrup and natural flavourings.

It's claimed the drink contains 5g of fibre per serving compared to just 3.9g per 30g helping of Kellogg's Bran Flakes and 20g protein - more than the 12g found in two whole eggs.

But nutritionist Zoe Harcombe was sceptical about the benefits of the drink. 

She told MailOnline: 'Are we really so lazy and care about our bodies so little 
that we won't even take two minutes to make porridge or five minutes to 
boil some eggs?

'The world does not need any more fake food. The world needs humans to put a tiny bit of effort into eating properly once more.

Hungry: The new drink is aimed at men, 74 per cent of whom are are said to skip breakfast

'The product boasts about it's fibre and protein content, but the real alternatives (not sugary cereal comparators) still win.

'The manufacturer is not comparing like with like. Calorie
for calorie (this breakfast drink has approximately 300 calories per 
serving), there is 50 per cent more fibre in oats and 35 per cent more 
protein in eggs.

'The 
product doesn't mention the 44g of sugar per serving - about 10 
teaspooons - not the best way to start the day if you want to keep blood
glucose levels stable.'

Research two years ago by the yogurt manufacturer Onken found that some 64 per cent of people sacrifice breakfast for extra time in bed or to get to work earlier.

Men skip their morning meal the most, with 74 per cent admitting lunch is their first meal of the day, the survey found.

The drink, which costs between £1.49 and £1.89, is the brainchild of former Innocent employee Barney Maulevere.

The entrepreneur, based in Shaftesbury, Dorset, said the breakfast market has stagnated in Britain and is ripe for a shake-up.

'A
lot of people these days, particularly men, are not having breakfast, 
he said. 'We present it as everything you need for your morning fix.'

Similar
products are already a success in Australia and America, where a brand 
called Muscle Milk. enjoys a turnover of $220 (USD) million per year
