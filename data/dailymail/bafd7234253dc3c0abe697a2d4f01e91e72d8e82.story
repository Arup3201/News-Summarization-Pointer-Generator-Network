Tony Abbott is refusing to apologise for controversially saying taxpayers shouldn't fund the 'lifestyle choices' of Australians in remote communities despite backlash from indigenous leaders.

The Prime Minister sparked outrage when he backed a West Australian plan to close 150 remote communities on Tuesday, saying governments couldn't endlessly subsidise people who chose to live far away from schools and jobs.

'It is not the job of the taxpayer to subsidise lifestyle choices,' Mr Abbott told ABC Radio in Kalgoorlie on Tuesday.

'Fine, by all means live in a remote location, but there's a limit to what you can expect the state to do for you if you want to live there.

'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.'

Labor and the Greens are demanding he apologise for comments they have described as racist and highly offensive. 

Speaking on Sydney's 2GB Radio on Wednesday, Mr Abbott defended his comments saying he was just being realistic and stating a 'general principle'.  

'If you or I chose to live in a very remote place, to what extent is the taxpayer obliged to subsidise our services?' he told host Alan Jones.

'It is incredibly difficult for the kids to go to school if there's only half a dozen of them and getting teachers there is all but impossible.

'Similarly, it's very difficult for the adults to get a proper job if there's no employment within hundreds of miles and this is where we have to be a little bit realistic.'

But the prime minister's chief indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine, disagreed with his comments.

'That is a complete misconception of what it is and he's wrong in that regard,' Mr Mundine told Fairfax Media. 

'It is not about a lifestyle, it is not like retiring and moving for a sea change, it is about thousands of years connection, their religious beliefs and the essence of who they are.'

Mr Abbott said there was a limit to what people living in remote communities could expect from the government if they chose to live there 

Mr Mundine said the prime minister's comments were a misconception

The hashtag #lifestylechoices started trending on Twitter on Wednesday following the PM's comments. 

Opposition indigenous affairs spokesman Shayne Neumann demanded a public apology to all Australians for what he called 'deeply disturbing and highly offensive' comments .

'This is a prime minister who doesn't understand the importance of these people to their connectivity to their land,' he told AAP.

Mr Neumann accused Mr Abbott of trying to undo any progress made in closing the gap of indigenous disadvantage.

Mr Abbott said it was reasonable for state governments to stop funding services in remote communities if the costs were out of proportion to the benefits.

Greens senator Rachel Siewert slammed the comments as 'unbelievably racist' and completely out of touch with reality.
