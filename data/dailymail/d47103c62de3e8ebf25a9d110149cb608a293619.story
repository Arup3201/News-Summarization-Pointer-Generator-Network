Maybe it's a reflection of the price of televisions - or just how little cars used to go for.

But more than one-fifth of young Britons admit that their current television cost more than their first car.

The average Briton between 18 and 30 spent just £500 on their first car - whereas they blew an average £700 on their first television.

Britons aged 18 to 30 admitted that they spent £500, on average, on their first car - enough to secure a fine vehicle such as this Renault

That's rather a lot considering you can easily pick up a 32-inch HD flatscreen for less than £300.

But for the 1,993 adults polled, a TV was an 'investment'.

The majority said that their reason for doing so was because they would have their TV for longer.

Those that said they had spent more on their current TV than on their first car were asked to explain why.

The majority, 67 per cent, said it was a better investment because ‘it would last longer’ - which certainly may be the case when a car is just £500.

Priorities: Young Britons now spend £700 on average on their first television, compared to just £500 on their first car - saying TVs were liable to last longer

Another 29 per cent said it was simply because they would ‘rather have a decent TV’.

When asked what the maximum amount was that they would spend on their next television, the majority, 51 per cent, claimed they would pay ‘£1,200.  The survey was conducted by website MyVoucherCodes.
