Samsung has applied for trademarks for a ‘smartwatch’ that connects to the internet and can make phone calls.

The Korean company is racing against its rival Apple to deliver the first watch that can surf the internet and make calls.

Trademark applications in the US and South Korea describe the ‘Samsung Galaxy Gear’ as a wearable digital electronic device in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle. It has a flexible display that curves around three quarters of the device.

A trademark application to the U.S patent office, pictured, has confirmed Samsung is working on a wearable device worn on a user's wrist. The filing affirms the company is working on a smartwatch-style device and that it will be called the Galaxy Gear

The first so-called smartwatch to become a mainstream product was the Pebble that launched via a Kickstarter campaign.

It let users sync their phones to a wrist-worn device and receive notifications from Facebook, Twitter as well as texts and emails without getting their phone out of their bag. 

Rumours then emerged that Apple was working on what's been dubbed iWatch after a number of patents were filed suggesting it was looking to develop wearable technology. 

Androidly became the world's first fully-featured smartwatch earlier this year and comes with a 2-inch screen and runs the Android operating system.

Sony announced its SmartWatch 2 in June but this device works in a similar way to the Pebble and not a fully-featured device.

Rumours about a Samsung smartwatch began following a patent filing in June that suggested the device would be called Gear.

This latest filing confirms that the name will be Galaxy Gear and it will be a wearable device capable of making and receiving calls.

Apart from replicating the services of a smartphone, it could also serve as a health monitor.

The device is also being rumoured to launch at an upcoming Samsung Unpacked event on 4 September.

According to the filing, originally discovered by Dutch fan site Galaxy Club, Samsung's Galaxy Gear range will be 'wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the Internet and for sending and receiving phone calls.'

It continues that the wristband will also be used for 'storage and/or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information; smart phones; tablet computers; portable computers.'

This latest filing follows one previously submitted in June by Samsung that described the smartwatch as a Samsung Gear, rather than Galaxy Gear.

The Galaxy addition to the name would mean the device would fit in with Samsung's existing range of Android-powered Galaxy smartphones.

Invites to Samsung unpacked event at this year's IFA conference in Berlin on 4 September have begun being sent out to journalists.

Samsung could use this event to launch 
the smartwatch as well as a new Galaxy Note 3 phablet - a cross between a
phone and a tablet.

Samsung announced earlier this month it is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Samsung's watch concept, pictured, shows a solid wooden band, and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running, for example

Sony announced its SmartWatch 2 in June but this device is classed as a 'phone remote' worn on a wearer's wrist rather than a full smartwatch with its own operating system.

The SmartWatch 2 syncs with any Android phone and shows notifications on a small screen attached to a wristband.

Samsung was expected to launch a smartwatch at an event in San Francisco last month but instead just confirmed it was 'investing heavily’ in wearable computers.

The company also revealed it is developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health.

‘Eventually
you won’t even know you’re wearing the device, it could be the fabric 
in your clothing, your glasses or your watch,’ Samsung’s Chief Strategy 
Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference.

‘In three or four years, the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically,’ Mr Sogn added and he believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available.

If Samsung does unveil a smartwatch in Berlin it could do so before rival Apple and its rumoured iWatch.

Apple is set to announce a new high-end iPhone handset, as well as a cheaper model in September and it could use the same event to announce the watch.

Dates for this announcement have varied between the end of August and October.
