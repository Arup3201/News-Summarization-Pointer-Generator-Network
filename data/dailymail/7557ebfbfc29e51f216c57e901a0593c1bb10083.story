Police are searching for two women in New York accused of using a young child to steal wallet inside a boutique clothes store and then a thrift shop.

Surveillance images of the pair in action during one of the alleged incidents have been released in the hopes of identifying them.

The two wide-set women can be seen directing the little girl, who is believed to be about four-years-old, to grab a purse that was near a cash register at the Karma Boutique in Queens, cops said on Monday.

'It's over there': Police are searching for two women who allegedly used a little girl to steal a wallet from the Karma boutique in Bayside, Queens, last Wednesday

Red-handed: After the child, who is believed to be related to the women, hands the wallet over, one of them appears to put it in her pants

The theft occurred on Wednesday at the shop on Bell Blvd. in Bayside.

CCTV footage shows the unwitting mini-crook handed the purse to one of the women, who then puts it in her pants.

The trio left the store moments after.

According to police, inside the wallet was $200 and a debit card.

An hour and a half later, police say the same child stole two purses from customers at a thrift shop on Corporal Kennedy Street while clerks were helping other patrons.

It is believed the two women and the child are related.

Anyone with information in regards to this robbery is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
