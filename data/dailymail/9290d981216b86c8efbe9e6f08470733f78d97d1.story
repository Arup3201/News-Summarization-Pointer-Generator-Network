MasterCard has started mining Facebook users' activity to gain consumer behaviour insights it can sell to banks.

The credit card and social networking giants have signed a two-year deal which allows MasterCard to use information from Facebook users in its new 'Priceless Engine' marketing technology.

The technology uses anonymous data from Asia Pacific Facebook users to help MasterCard and banks drive sales.

'Priceless Engine [is] an innovative new platform for marketing that allows the brand to provide its bank partners with the deep insights that help them deliver the right offers to their customers at the right time,' MasterCard said in a statement.

MasterCard will start working with Australian banks in early 2015, but the company has not said how much it will charge for the use of its service.

A Facebook spokesman said:

'We applaud what Mastercard is doing with their 'Priceless Engine' but, to clarify, we are not providing them, or any other company, personal data of Facebook users. 

'We are working with them to create targeting clusters using Custom Audiences — a tool that matches anonymised data from Facebook with their own anonymised data for optimising ad delivery on Facebook to their users.'

The first Australian campaign to use Priceless Technology is connected to the Justin Timberlake 20/20 Experience World Tour, which is sponsored by MasterCard and will conclude in Perth on Thursday after three weeks in Australia.

MasterCard tested the technology by advertising offers related to the pop singer to its customers.

MasterCard head of marketing Asia Pacific, Sam Ahmed, said in once instance adding a red carpet to a black and white Justin Timberlake ad 'saw response rocket by 30 per cent', Mumbrella reported.

'We can see what's working and what's not working immediately,' he said.

Mr Ahmed said marketing campaigns could be altered within an hour to improve their effectiveness, whereas that type of analysis previously took up to four months.

Mr Ahmed added that digital marketing needed to be specifically targeted or it risked looking like spam.

'Consumers, especially millennials, are saying "you have my data, use it properly",' he said.

'Brands which don't do that are seen as spam.'

MasterCard said it plans to triple its investment in digital marketing in Asia Pacific over the next three years.

The company added that it would be working with 'key partners in the social media space' other than Facebook.
