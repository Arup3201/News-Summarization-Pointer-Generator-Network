Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer just got a lot richer - after selling 144 rental units at the Corinthian building in New York for $147m.

The huge deal suggests that Spitzer, who resigned as governor in 2008 in the wake of a prostitution scandal, will now take on a bigger role in his father Bernard's real estate company.

He rejoined the company last year after running unsuccessfully for city comptroller.

The East 38th Street building was built by Spitzer's father in the 1980s, and was sold to Gaia Real Estate, reports Page Six.

The company says it plans to 'renovate, rebrand and sell the units'. 

Crain's New York Business reports that Spitzer is also in talks to buy a near three-acre development site in Brooklyn - on Kent Avenue along the south Williamsburg waterfront - for $165m. 

It is expected some of the proceeds from the Corinthian sale will go towards the deal. 

Shamed: Spitzer resigning as New York governor at a news conference in New York on March 10, 2008

The former governor and attorney general, 55, was spotted in Paris with his new girlfriend Lis Smith, 31, at the weekend.

They stayed at the exclusive Pavillon de la Reine - a four-star hotel where the cheapest rooms cost $500 per night. 

Ms Smith is Spitzer's former publicist, and was behind his failed city comptroller campaign.

She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary.

But just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed Spitzer sneaking in and out of her Soho apartment last December.

Spitzer became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers.

His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes.

He reportedly had at least seven meetings with high-end prostitutes over a six-month period, and is also believed to have spent up to $80,000 on them over many years, starting when he was attorney general.

Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his then-wife Silda Wall Spitzer by his side.

The pair finalised a very public and bitter divorce in February. 

After his resignation, Spitzer attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father.
