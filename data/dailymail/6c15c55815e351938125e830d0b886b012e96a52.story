It is one of the most spectacular birds of prey, with a wingspan of more than 1.5 metres.

So when this magnificent osprey swooped down to poach a trout from a loch near Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands, the outcome was perhaps predictable.

But that didn’t stop one plucky duck from playing the role of gamekeeper. 

Catch: The osprey swoops for the trout in the Scottish Highlands loch -  drawing the attention of a mallard

Attack: The osprey attempts to take flight with the trout between its claws - and with the mallard in hot pursuit

As the raptor clasped the fish between its iron-like talons, the outraged mallard – a featherweight by comparison, with a mere 80cm wingspan – launched a full-frontal attack.

Spreading its wings, it churned the water into a frenzy, quacking loudly in anger. 

Had the osprey, also known as a sea hawk, not been so determined, it may well have scored a duck.

But in the end, the mallard’s valiant efforts were in vain and the osprey made away with its tasty catch. 

Leaving the issue of fishing rights still to be decided – by ‘the beak’ perhaps?

Escape: The osprey flies away with its claws gripped firmly on the helpless trout
