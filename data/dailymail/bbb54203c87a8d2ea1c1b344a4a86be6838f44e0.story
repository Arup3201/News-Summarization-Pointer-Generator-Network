Harry Redknapp’s remedy for England’s World Cup hangover is to stop trying to mimic their more successful European rivals and focus on producing football branded with their own national identity.

After signing former England captain Rio Ferdinand, the Queens Park Rangers manager claimed there are plenty of quality players and wants to see Roy Hodgson forge them into a team based on attacking flair with the confidence to play out of defence.

He said: 'I thought England were certainties to win what in my opinion was a very poor group. I was very surprised. Costa Rica winning the group tells you everything really.

Pointing the finger: Redknapp says England must develop their own style of play to be used from top to bottom

'We have good players and we have a good manager. Don’t ask me what happens. We’ve had lots of good players and managers since 1966. But we are going to win the World Cup in Qatar so they say, in 40 degree heat.'

Here was a swipe at FA chairman Greg Dyke who launched a nine-year plan last year to win the title by 2022 and the QPR boss, overlooked when Hodgson took the job two years ago, clearly has little faith in the FA to stop the slump.

'Germany won because Germany produce good players. It goes in cycles.

'France win the World Cup and we have to copy the French. Then it’s Spain, so we have to copy Spain. And then Germany.

'Let’s be ourselves. Let’s get the best players and decide what is England’s style of play and everyone should play the same way, down through the youth teams and employ people to work with the kids who want to play that way.'Play from the back, like I said to Rio Ferdinand when he was 16: ‘Come out with the ball, I don’t want to see you booting the ball up the pitch. You play and if you lose the ball I will take the blame because I’m telling you to play that way.'We have to do that with England and produce teams who play from the back. But the people involved in the younger England teams, are they people who want to play that way? I don’t know.'
