If Yaya Sanogo's four goal performance in Arsenal's pre-season friendly against Benfica is anything to go by, the young Frenchman is ready to silence his critics ahead of the new Premier League season.

The 21-year-old was in brilliant form as his side took part in their first Emirates Cup match on Saturday afternoon.

Even a clumsy slip by Sanogo as he celebrated his fourth goal of the game couldn't stop him from lapping up the fans' praise.

The moment was clearly too much for the the striker as he tripped on a microphone, sending him flying as he wheeled away in celebration of his second half strike.

Sanogo looks to have struck up a dangerous relationship with Arsenal forward Joel Campbell, who also found the net against a poor Benfica side.

There's no doubt that if Sanogo can keep up such goal scoring form, the Arsenal fans will forgive the odd celebration slip-up.
