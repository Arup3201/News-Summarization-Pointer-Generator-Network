Footballing legend Diego Maradona has been labelled a psychopath after a video emerged appearing to show him assaulting his on-off girlfriend.

In the video, Maradona can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his girlfriend Rocio Oliva to have a go at her for using her mobile.

Ms Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.'

She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand.

He is then alleged to have hit her, although he later claimed he had only knocked the phone from her hand

Last night Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, tried to ride out the storm by insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands.

He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.

'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.'

Maradona was put on the defensive after the 30-second video, secretly recorded by his former fiancee, was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme yesterday.

It is thought to have been recorded at the retired footballer's apartment near Buenos Aires when he returned to Argentina earlier this month after his dad was rushed to hospital.

He is now back at his home in Dubai without either Ms Oliva or former girlfriend Veronica Ojeda, who he has also been romantically linked to in recent months despite dumping her when she was four months pregnant with their child Diego Fernando.

Last night Ms Oliva's aunt branded him a 'psychopath and woman beater'.

It is not the first time Maradona has been accused of falling out with the 24-year-old, who he started dating at the beginning of last year after breaking up with Ojeda, 34.

In May last year he allegedly had a row with her on a plane. Passengers on board the jet told how the pair exchanged insults and business class travellers including a politician's wife and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down.

The incident happened as he went to meet his baby son by Veronica Ojeda for the first time.

This summer he was also filmed slapping a male journalist he accused of winking at his former girlfriend.
