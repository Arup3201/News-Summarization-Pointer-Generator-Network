Horrific: The body of missing 12-year-old boy Christopher Marks has been found in a river by his stepfather, it has emerged

The body of a missing 12-year-old boy has been found in a river by his stepfather, it has emerged.

Christopher Marks vanished during a family picnic near the Meramec River in Missouri on Sunday night.

He was visiting the Pacific Palisades Conservation Area with his stepfather and six other children.

Since then, a huge search involving the emergency services and volunteers has been underway. But police have revealed that the youngster was found dead yesterday afternoon.

According to the Affton-Shrewsbury Patch, his body was found by Todd Combs—Christopher’s stepfather - about six miles east of where he was last seen.

His grandmother, Lisa Miskimon, posed a message on the local newspaper website,  saying: 'This is the most horrible thing my family has gone through, and I would
like to thank all of the wonderful people in our hometown for all their
prayers and all the comments that are posted here.'

At about 7.30pm on Sunday, Christopher went to go and use a rope swing. The rest of the group - including his 15-year-old sister Katie - stayed on the beach.

However, he was not seen again. Family members began searching for him but after two hours they contacted police.

Emergency
services and desperate family members then began a massive search of the 
river and surrounding areas for Christoper.

Distraught family members had hoped that a dropped tube of lip balm meant the 
youngster was still alive.

Donna Sherman, his great 
aunt, found the tube of lip balm in the road near the entrance to the 
conservation area on Monday morning.

Christopher's
twin sister Anna-Marie says she gave her brother an identical tube of 
lip balm before the family went for the picnic.

The family had hoped the discovery meant the youngster got safely out of the river and became lost, walking out of the area.

The boy's mother, Elizabeth Combs, had previously issued an appeal for her son.

She told Fox 2 News: 'There is a good chance that he made it out and is just walking somewhere thinking "Oh my God, all these cops, am I in trouble?" You are not in trouble. We just want you home.'

According to the boy's sister Katie, he drank a small amount of beer but was not drunk when he went off on his own.

An autopsy is expected to reveal a time of death and other clues as to how he died.

Hope: Volunteers prayed for the missing youngster while searching for him
