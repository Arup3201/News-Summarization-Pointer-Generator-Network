A nurse accused along with nine others of trying to steal part of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt's £25 billion fortune tried to take his own life a day before his trial was to begin. 

The deputy prosecutor told a Bordeaux court today that Alain Thurin, 64, wouldn't be appearing in court this week as he had attempted to commit suicide yesterday.

Thurin was charged along with nine others of exploiting the 'vulnerability' of 92-year-old Mrs Bettencourt - France's richest woman. 

It is not known whether Thurin survived the suicide attempt.

The trial centres around a feud between Mrs Bettencourt and her daughter Francoise Bettencourt Meyers that grew into a complex web of betrayal and dodgy dealings involving close to a dozen people.

It also involves a butler's betrayal, advancing dementia, unscrupulous friends and cash-filled envelopes for senior politicians. The five week trial has become known as the 'Bettencourt Affair'.

Many expected former president Nicolas Sarkozy to have been dragged into proceedings, but he was cleared of any wrong doing last year.  

Potential charges of tax evasion against Mrs Bettencourt were also dropped. This was despite prosecutors accusing Mr Sarkozy's lieutenants of illegally accepting brown envelopes full of cash from Mrs Bettencourt in order to fund his election campaign in 2007. 

French authorities also ordered Mrs Bettencourt to pay back some £86 million in unpaid taxes after allegedly trying to hush up her purchase of an entire island in the Seychelles.

Mr Sarkozy's former campaign treasurer, Eric Woerth, is among the 10 defendants, along with Patrice de Maistre, who managed Mrs Bettencourt's billions. 

Both men face up to five years in prison after being charged with money laundering, as well as taking advantage of Mrs Bettencourt's 'vulnerability'. 

De Maistre is heard in tapes seized by the prosecution encouraging Mrs Bettencourt to avoid paying tax - including hiding the purchase of the private island.

Francois-Marie Banier, an artist and photographer, became a close confidant of Mrs Bettencourt and she showered him with gifts, including paintings by Picasso and Matisse and millions in cash.

Banier, along with his life partner Martin d'Orgeval and three of the L'Oréal heiress' notaries, are facing charges.

Pascal Wilhelm, who was Mrs Bettencourt's estate manager after de Maistre, French businessman Stephane Courbit, tax lawyer Carlos Vejarano, and Mrs Bettencourt's fiscal lawyer Fabrice Goguel complete the line-up in court.

Mrs Bettencourt's daughter, Ms Meyers, filed charges against Banier in 2007 for exploiting her mother's growing mental fragility.

Two years later Mrs Bettencourt's butler, Pascal Bonnefoy, started recording her conversations in an attempt to gather evidence of exploitation.

Banier is facing three years in prison. Mrs Bettencourt was declared unfit to run her own affairs in 2011 after a medical report showed she suffered from Alzheimers disease.

Her fortune and the L'Oreal company, which was founded by Bettencourt's father Eugene Schueller in 1909, is now under the guardianship of family members. The trial is expected to last for five weeks.
