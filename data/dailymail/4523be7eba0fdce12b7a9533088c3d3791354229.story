Urging John McAfee to turn himself in, the prime minister of Belize called the antivirus pioneer 'bonkers' as he remains on the run while cops investigate the murder of his neighbor.

McAfee said yesterday that he is in hiding, unarmed and accompanied only by a young woman, changing locations and telephones frequently to stay one step ahead of a Belize police unit he claims wants to kill him.

Prime Minister Dean Barrow said McAfee was only wanted for questioning and should report to authorities.

Barrow also expressed doubts about 
McAfee's mental state, saying: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I
 believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.'

Belize police have said they want to question McAfee, who they describe as a 'person of interest' in the slaying of fellow American Gregory Viant Faull.

Faull, 52, was shot to death over the weekend on the Caribbean island where both men lived.

From his secret location, McAfee,  67, has been in contact with reporters, including Wired editor Joshua Davis, who has been providing updates on the case through his Twitter feed.

The latest update read: '[McAfee] says his hideout has a cathode ray tube TV and he watched an episode of Rawhide. His girlfriend thinks it's boring.'

McAfee, who had a run-in with police earlier this year, told The Associated Press by telephone that he didn't kill Faull, though he acknowledged he had differences with the dead man.

'I barely knew him, I barely spoke ten words to him in the last three years,' McAfee said, speaking on a cellphone. 'Certainly he was not my favorite person and I was not his.'

'He was a heavy drinker and an annoyance. But the world is full of annoyances; if we killed all of our annoyances, there would be nobody left,' McAfee said.

Other expat residents of the island of Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is located, have described Faull, the owner of a construction business in Orlando, Florida, as peaceful and well-liked.

The dispute apparently involved several dogs that McAfee kept at his beachside villa and that drew complaints from neighbors.

McAfee said that four of his dogs were poisoned late last week, but that he didn't initially suspect Faull of having killed them, though he knew Faull didn't like the dogs.

'He did threaten to shoot them once or twice,' McAfee said of Faull, adding that his neighbor was 'always angry at them.'

But he said he now believes government agents or police poisoned the dogs.

'My assumption was it was some kind of government action again. This is more harassment - that was the first thing that went through my mind, and still is going through my mind. What else could it have been?' he said.

Faull was found with a gunshot wound to his head inside his two-story home north of San Pedro. The housekeeper discovered the body Sunday morning and called police.

Raphael Martinez, spokesman for Belize's Ministry of National Security, said no charges had been filed in the case, but asked that McAfee turn himself in, accompanied by someone else, if he felt safer that way.

But McAfee said he feared that Belize's notorious Gang Suppression Unit, the GSU, a paramilitary-style squad that has been accused of rough treatment and that raided another property McAfee owns in Belize in April, would beat him and he would later die in custody.

'The GSU will do what the GSU does, beat me soundly until I confess to a multitude of sins, including I guess the murder of Jimmy Hoffa, and then just execute me,' McAfee said.

He accused authorities of detaining his friends and associates in a bid to pressure him to turn himself in.

'Of course, and it's almost working,' McAfee said. 'I'm sitting here, the young woman who is with me now and who has been by my side, and trying to keep me upbeat through this, I said, "You know, I'll just call and say I'll turn myself in, just let these people go." And she said, "Absolutely not, they will kill you."'

'I keep moving constantly, sir ... and I keep changing telephones constantly, this phone will expire shortly,' he said.

McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus program, has led a life of eccentricity since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named for him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes.

Yesterday, McAfee told Davis that his last-ditch effort to evade authorities was ‘radically alter(ing) my appearance,’ dying his salt-and-pepper hair and beard jet black.

'I'll probably look like a murderer, unfortunately,' he said, according to Davis.

McAfee told the Associated Press via 
email in May that ‘the government wants me out of the way. Too many 
people have died in custody in this country so I intend to do nothing 
that puts me in their custody.’

He has been in hiding since a raid on 
his house in April where authorities accused him of running a 
methamphetamine lab.

Because he’s in an undisclosed location away from 
his house, he told Wired that he’s afraid police have planted 
incriminating evidence, perhaps guns or ‘four tons of cocaine.’

He said he heard Faull had been 
shot but that he believed it to have been a case of mistaken identity 
and it was in fact him who the shooter had intended to kill.

Insisting that the murder was carried
 out by the police themselves, he added: 'They got the wrong house. Call
 me paranoid [but] They've been trying to get me for months. They want
 to silence me. I am not well liked by the Prime Minister.'

He had earlier phoned the reporter to say: 'Power was just cut to
 the house I’m in. I think this is it,' but hours later, called again to
 say that he changed locations and that he was safe for the time being.'

Millions: McAfee made millions on his antivirus software of the same name

The revelation came after it emerged McAfee had discussed experimenting with the dangerous drug known as 
bath salts in extensive online postings on a drug-friendly Russian message board.

'I’m a huge fan of MDPV. I think it's
 the finest drug ever conceived, not just for the indescribable 
hypersexuality, but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown,' he 
wrote.

He posted on the online message board
 between 2010 and 2011, but leaving and saying that his online 
activities were interfering with his experimentation with drugs.

Radar Online reports that McAfree bought the drugs online and worked in a makeshift lab in a hut to purify them.

'The
 on-line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of
 the many experiments I've done using my own body over the past year or 
so, and I have work to do,' he wrote.
