A woman who was so fat she struggled to fit through the door and was given less than four years to live has shed a staggering 22st.

Jane Smythe Longhurst, 46, tipped the scales at 36st, was left housebound as she struggled to walk - or even stand.

Unable to stand long enough to cook herself a meal, the mother-of-three spent her evenings gorging on takeaways and piling on the pounds.

At her heaviest, Jane, from Langley near Manchester, wasn’t even able to wash herself and was totally dependent on her daughter, Melissa Longhurst, 23, to care for her and bring her meals.

Jane said: 'I was in such a rut, for years I would pick at food all day and then eat takeaways at night.

'I didn’t go out the house because I was just so embarrassed that my daughter was my carer.

'When I got really big, I lived on takeaways primarily as I couldn’t get up and stand to cook a meal as I was in constant pain, it was horrendous.

'A seat belt in a car wouldn’t fit and when I had pictures taken I noticed I was wider than the doors.'

With her weight spiralling out of control, Jane was diagnosed with pulmonary stenosis, oedema, high blood pressure and arthritis in her arms, spine, neck and legs.

At her heaviest (left) Jane was unable to stand long enough to cook a meal and when doctors told her weight was threatening her life she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery (right, in hospital)

Jane now says her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day

Unable to even leave her home, doctors told her she would be dead within four years if she didn’t alter her eating habits and significantly reduce her weight.

But in November 2012, she had a gastric bypass which helped her to drop an incredible 22st - saving her life.

She said: 'I had written letters to my family just in case I didn’t make it as there was a real possibility I wouldn’t.

'I was obviously very anxious at the time, but the operation was a complete success, I suffered no complications and was home the next day.

'The week after my operation, I found out I was going to be a nana for the first time, I was so happy.'

Jane, who is the youngest of five children, says she was spoilt as a child and started to gradually gain weight at age 11.

By the time she reached adulthood, she started to binge excessively on chocolate, crisps and late night takeaways, ignoring her parents’ advice to lose weight through exercising and dieting.

In one desperate bid to lose weight, she even attempted to starve herself, but Jane, who had to buy specially made clothes on EBay, was unable to keep her weight down.

As well as the surgery shrinking the size of her stomach, Jane has totally changed her diet, swapping takeaways for fresh healthy food

And when she met her now fiancé, Mark Alvis, 49, her body mass index (BMI) soared to a massive 89.6 - more than 60 units above the recommended average for an adult.

But it was only when Jane reached her heaviest that she was referred to a weight management specialist who secured her funding for the gastric band operation.

Dr Alan Li of Spire Manchester Hospital carried out the surgery and through a strict diet of mainly fruit and vegetables, Jane managed to shed a staggering 22st.

She said: 'I love being able to buy clothes from normal shops for the first time.

'I haven’t even thought about eating any chocolate or anything sweet since my bypass.

'I am determined I was given an opportunity to change my life, so that’s exactly what I’m doing.

'I can now see a future with my children, grandchild and husband to be.'

Following her remarkable weight loss, Jane’s partner Mark from Bristol, proposed in February this year and she said her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day.

She still suffers from arthritis and takes medication to keep her blood pressure down, but after years of obesity Jane is now able to spend more time with her one-year-old grandchild, Amelia Jane and said she is determined to grab life with both hands.

She said: 'The excess skin I’ve been left with does get me down and does add to the pain I suffer with on a daily basis.

'Some would say it’s a small price to pay, but it’s very disheartening when you have worked so hard to lose so much weight.

'But on the other hand, I wouldn’t change my decision to have a bypass, it changed my life and I wouldn’t be here to see my beautiful grandchild without it.'
