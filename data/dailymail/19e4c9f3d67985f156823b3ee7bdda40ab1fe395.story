NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was among several witnesses cross-examined at the Ray Rice appeal hearing in New York  yesterday

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was the first witness called in to Ray Rice's appeal hearing yesterday, and testified under oath for more than two hours.

He was among several witnesses cross-examined by NFL Players Association lawyer Jeffrey Kessler as part of the two-day hearing.

No details  of the testimony are avaiable.

Goodell left the session just after 2pm and climbed into a black SUV without commenting on the case, ABC News reported.

Disgraced former NFL star Rice is making his case to return to the field after the league indefinitely suspended him from the game after footage emerged of him knocking his then fiancee unconscious earlier this year.

Rice, 27, claims he has been punished twice for the same offense, a one-punch knockout of Janay Palmer during a February altercation at an Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino.

Goodell initially gave Rice a two-game suspension for the fight, but in September after video of the punch went viral, he suspended the player indefinitely.

Rice has said he explained the incident to Goodell, but the commissioner claims his account was ‘ambiguous’ and was brought into focus when the video of the punch materialized.

Goodell said he had not seen the video from inside the casino's elevator until it surfaced on the internet.

As well as the NFL commissioner, league security chief Jeffery Miller, Ravens President Dick Cass and Rice are among the witnesses expected to testify at the two-day hearing. Rice's wife, Janay, might also testify. 

The Ravens cut Rice and his $35 million contract, amid a wave of public criticism that the league had turned a blind eye to domestic violence by players.

Other Ravens executives and members of the players union are expected to speak during the hearing before arbitrator Barbara Jones, a former federal judge.

The hearing will be closed to the press and public and Jones has issued a gag order forbidding participants from discussing it publicly. 

Goodell admitted that he ‘didn't get it right’ when he suspended Rice for just two games, and the league has since strengthened its penalties for domestic abuse.

The league also hired Lisa Friel, the former head of sex crimes prosecutions in the New York district attorney's office, to help the NFL deal with domestic violence and sexual assault. 

The player's legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice should only be suspended for a maximum of six games.

Should Jones side with Rice and his original two-game suspension, the six-year NFL veteran would be free to sign with any team.

That amount of games has already passed.

Experts are predicting that Rice's suspension will be dropped, leaving him ample time to find another team to join before the season is even halfway over.

But which team would be bold enough to hire him? 

Last month CBSSports.com reported last that two teams may be willing to take a chance.

The first is the Indianapolis Colts, whose coach Chuck Pagano used to work for the Ravens and 'thinks highly' of Rice.

Another prospect is the New England Patriots, where coach Bill Belichick has strong ties to Rice's Rutgers University coach Greg Schiano.
