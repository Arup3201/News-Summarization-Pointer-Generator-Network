Rupert Murdoch issued an instruction to his newspaper editors to 'kill off' the Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam

News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch wanted Gough Whitlam ousted as Australian Prime Minister, according to US Diplomatic documents that reveal he made very clear instructions to the editors of his newspapers to 'kill off' the former PM.

The US National Archives has just declassified a secret diplomatic telegram from January 20, 1975 that shows Murdoch's role in trying to undermine the Labor-led prime minister, much like he did Kevin Rudd in the 2013 national poll, 10 months before he was controversially dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr.

Fairfax Media has reported that a telegram, entitled 'Australian publisher privately turns on Prime Minister,' from US Consul-General in Melbourne, Robert Brand, reported to the State Department that 'Rupert Murdoch issued confidential instruction to editors of newspapers he controls to 'Kill Whitlam.'

Mr Brand noted Murdoch had been 'the principal publisher supporting the Whitlam election effort in 1972 Labor victory', but the head of a publishing empire that includes The Australian, as well as The Daily and Sunday Telegraphs, quickly turned on the Labor leader and told his newspapers to do the same.

He had become unsatisfied by Labor's economic management an thought Whitlam appeared to have abandoned his election-winning hopes. Murdoch's new editorial direction changed the face of Australia's political landscape completely, and less than a year later, on November 11, 1975 Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Whitlam as the prime minister after the opposition blocked the budget in the Senate.

Tony Abbott was on the receiving end of Murdoch's Daily Telegraph campaign which helped him win the 2013 Australian election

It led to a crushing defeat for the Labor Government in the national election on December 13, largely as a result of the Murdoch-backed campaign for the Malcolm Fraser Government. Labor did not return to Government until seven years later under Bob Hawke.

AAP has reported that In the diplomatic telegram, Mr Brand makes it clear that the words "kill Whitlam" were used in a political context and not as a physical threat. Brand also said that Murdoch had previously supported Mr Whitlam's election before his publishing empire turned against the leader.

"If Murdoch attack directed against Whitlam personally this could presage hard times for Prime Minister; but if against Labor government would be dire news for party," the telegraph reportedly said.

Last year, Murdoch and his Australian title The Daily Telegraph waged war against former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd consigning him to the 'bin of history.'

The newspaper ran a relentless Tony Abbott-backed campaign including a front page article which told voters 'the time is up for Kevin Rudd and his Labor government.'

The article stated: 'On September 7, Australia will indeed find a new way - by throwing out a government that has completely lost its way.' The Government was heavily defeated and Abbott was installed as the new PM.
