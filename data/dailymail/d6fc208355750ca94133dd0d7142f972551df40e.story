First Big Brother's Josie Gibson and Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby brought out fitness DVDs - and now another reality star is following in their footsteps.

Dee Kelly, aka White Dee from Benefits Street, is launching her own workout routine after losing three stone in two months.

With her anniversary of living off handouts coming up this month, and a trip to Las Vegas in the pipeline, the new lean, happier Dee, 43, wants to share her exercise tips with the world.

Dee, who is 43-years old, has been working out in the gym and says that her exercise regime has helped her to battle her depression

She wants to put together her fitness regime by the summer after shedding the pounds since leaving the Celebrity Big Brother house last September.

She has been regularly put through her paces during private boxing and weightlifting training sessions at her local gym in Birmingham.

The mum-of-two has also been working out with pal John Fox, who is a DJ for the city's biggest radio station Free Radio.

Yesterday her agent Barry Tomes, 57, said the pair have now started filming a fitness DVD together, which will be released later in the year.

Dee has been trying out lots of different equipment in the gym, including the cycling machine and the treadmill losing an impressive three stone in two months 

Dee gets to grips with the treadmill, she is working on her DVD with the DJ John Fox who works for Free Radio, he has been helping to train her over the last few months  

He added: 'Dee lost three stone in two months. She has been in the gym regularly since she left Celebrity Big Brother.

'She is recording and releasing the fitness DVD with Foxy from Free Radio. I think he is part excited and part nervous.

'He has been training in the gym with her recently because he wants to get fit for his wedding. He has lost two stone in two months.

'So we are writing up a full programme for the workout, so everything from a warm-up to a cool down as you would do at the gym. 

Dee's weight has gone up and down over the years, but she's now lost three stone and is planning to release a fitness DVD. Here she is pictured before losing three stone

'People assume that fitness exercises are for people who are slim and fit but actually we are going to go to the beginning.

'Dee has been amazing. She has not always been fit and it showed in her weight. But she has been very good and I am hugely impressed at her weight loss. It has helped her with her depression too, which is great.'

Mr Tomes also revealed Dee is set to undertake TV work in the United States and has intended to get in shape as she bids to crack America.

He added: 'She has been going to the gym a lot because she has been trying to get fit for Las Vegas when we go out there soon. They're so image-conscious in the States but this could help her crack it.' 

Dee has suffered from depression in the past and her agent has revealed that losing the weight and exercising more has helped her to cope with it  

Barry revealed that Dee - who previously tried to lose weight with a £1,000 treatment called Lipoglaze - will have been off benefits for a year on 22 March and so they are heading to Vegas to celebrate. He also hopes that she will be able to launch her career out there.  

He said: 'We are talking about getting her on programmes over there that are the equivalent of Good Morning Britain, that sort of thing.

'There are more beggars in LA than anywhere else in the world. That is because they don't have a benefits system in America.

'[Dee's story] shows you can change your life with a little bit of help and the Americans like that story.'

Dee starred in Benefits street in January 2014, filmed on James Turner Street in Birmingham. The fly-on-the-wall documentary followed her and her friends and neighbours as they lived their lives on benefits. 

She went on to star in Celebrity Big Brother in 2014 alongside Lauren Goodger and Edele Lynch, she came fifth in the show.
