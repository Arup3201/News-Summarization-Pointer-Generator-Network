A mother whose son suffered brain damage at birth has been awarded £5.2million after a 16-year battle with the NHS.

Scotland’s highest court had twice rejected Nadine Montgomery’s claim that medical negligence caused her son’s physical disabilities.

But in a landmark legal ruling seven judges of the Supreme Court in London upheld the 40-year-old mother’s claim in what was described as ‘the most significant medical negligence judgment in 30 years’.

Nadine Montgomery, whose son suffers from cerebral palsy after he was starved of oxygen during birth, argued she was not properly advised on having a Cesarean by medics at NHS Lanarkshire

Mrs Montgomery expressed delight yesterday that the care of her son, Sam, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was now guaranteed. 

The biologist from Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, said: ‘This is an enormous relief after a long legal fight, ensuring Sam receives the best care for the rest of his life.’

First-time mother Mrs Montgomery gave birth to her son in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, run by NHS Lanarkshire, in October 1999.

The slightly-built Type 1 diabetic claimed that during her pregnancy she expressed concerns about the birth.

Shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby becomes stuck during delivery, potentially starving the infant of oxygen and leading to brain defects.

It is particularly common among the children of diabetes sufferers, which are often larger than typical children.

Ms Montgomery, a type 1 diabetes sufferer, said the risks of natural delivery, and the prospect of having a Cesarean, were not discussed with her.

Her son, Sam, suffered from shoulder dystocia during birth, and now has cerebral palsy.

It is recognised that diabetic mothers can deliver larger babies, placing them at higher risk of complications, including the possibility of ‘shoulder dystocia’ where a newborn gets stuck in the pelvis.

In her case, Sam’s shoulder stuck after delivery of his head. Staff released the shoulder but during a 12-minute delay he suffered oxygen deprivation.

He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, caused by permanent brain injury at birth.

Mrs Montgomery claimed that had she been advised properly, she would have opted for the alternative of a Caesarean section and Sam would have been born uninjured.

But she said her obstetrician Dr Dina McLellan decided not to discuss the risks or suggest a Caesarean.

At an earlier hearing, judges heard it was not Dr McLellan’s ‘practice’ to discuss the potential risks of shoulder dystocia, claiming that the risk for the baby was very small, and that Caesareans were not in the ‘maternal interests’ of women.

Mrs Montgomery’s case for compensation had twice been rejected by the Court of Session in Edinburgh.

But Lord Reed, who delivered the Supreme Court Justices’ decision yesterday said: ‘An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken.

Her claim for compensation was twice rejected by Scotland's highest court, but she was yesterday awarded £5.2million after London's Supreme Court overturned the ruling (file image)

‘There can be no doubt it was incumbent on Dr McLellan to advise Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia if she were to have her baby by vaginal delivery, and to discuss with her the alternative of delivery by Caesarean.

‘The only conclusion we can reasonably reach is that, had she (the consultant) advised Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia and discussed with her dispassionately the potential consequences, Mrs Montgomery would probably have elected to be delivered of her baby by Caesarean section. It is not in dispute that the baby would then have been born unharmed.’

A relieved Mrs Montgomery said: ‘This judgement is an enormous relief after a very long legal fight. I believe that I have a right to know of all the risks surrounding Sam's birth and I am pleased the Supreme Court has recognised that.

'I hope this means other patients will not have to go through what I have gone through. The decision will allow me to ensure Sam receives the best possible care for the rest of his life.'

Dr Iain Wallace, Medical Director at NHS Lanarkshire, said: ‘Since this case, practices have changed significantly. Women are more fully informed and advised of the risks and complications of pregnancy.

'We are disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision which has applied retrospectively to the law relating to informed consent and to this case.

'We have only just received this judgement and will need time to consider it fully. We understand, however, that it materially changes the law relating to consent and we, along with other health boards in the UK, will need time to consider very carefully any potential implications for future service provision.'
