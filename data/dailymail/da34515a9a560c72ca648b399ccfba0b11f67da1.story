Barack Obama today continued to pile pressure on Congress to extend tax cuts for the middle class, saying a rates hike would be like getting a 'lump of coal' for Christmas.

In the first of a series of campaign-style speeches designed to sell his solution for the 'fiscal cliff', the President argued that Republicans should extend existing Bush-era tax rates for households earning $250,000 or less, while allowing increases to kick in for the wealthy.

However, Republican leader John Boehner described the state of negotiations as a 'stalemate' and criticised Obama for not making a serious offer on a deal.

Appeal: Barack Obama went to a K'nex factory in the Philadelphia suburbs as part of a national tour

The President was touring a toy factory in the Philadelphia suburbs when he said the GOP and Democrats alike needed to 'get out of our comfort zones' to forge an agreement.

He urged the public to pressure their local members of Congress to pass the middle-class tax cut extension as quickly as possible.

Pointing out that every American family will face a tax hike on January 1 if no deal is reached, Obama said: 'I'm assuming that doesn't sound too good to you. That's sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. That's a Scrooge Christmas.'

He insisted he was ready to sign a deal straightaway, joking, 'There are no shortage of pens in the White House and I carry one around for an emergency, just in case.'

Speaking out: The President said a middle-class tax hike would be like a 'lump of coal' for Christmas

The President was clearly in a comic mood as he quipped that he was 'keeping my own naughty and nice list' to determine which members of Congress would get sets of K'nex, the toy which is made at the factory in Hatfield where he was speaking.

He also took a dig at Joe Biden, who was pictured shopping at Costco on Thursday, saying: 'He wanted to buy some of this stuff, but I told him he had too much work to do. I wasn't going to have him building roller coasters all day long.'

Also on Thursday, an effort made on behalf of Democrats Thursday to avert the looming fiscal cliff turned out to be fruitless.

The White House made an offer to House Republicans that aides familiar with the talks panned as ‘a joke’, ‘an insult’ and ‘a complete break from reality,’ according to CBS News.

One Republican aide familiar with the offer that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House congressional liason Rob Nabors presented to Boehner confirmed the Democrat leaders said their proposed $4trillion package would raise $1.6trillion in tax revenue up front.

House Republicans called that number too high and too extreme to be offering this late in the game with only a month left before the deadline.

Joking: Obama was clearly in a comic mood despite the seriousness of the upcoming 'fiscal cliff'

Democrats said they would give in on $400billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like Medicare in exchange for the added tax revenue.

Boehner slammed that number right after the meeting at a press conference though he would not say what the number should be.

‘No substantive progress has been made between the White House and the House, in the two weeks since Obama welcomed congressional leaders at the White House,' Boehner said.

Democrats swiftly countered that any holdup was the fault of Republicans who refuse to accept Obama’s campaign-long call to raise tax rates on upper incomes.

At the White House, presidential press secretary Jay Carney said, ‘There can be no deal without rates on top earners going up.’ Taking a confrontational, at times sarcastic tone, he said, ‘This should not be news to anyone on Capitol Hill. It is certainly not news to anyone in America who was not in a coma during the campaign season.’

Making a list: Obama promised to give K'nex to members of Congress who co-operate with the White House

With barely a month remaining until a year-end deadline, the hardening of positions seemed more likely to mark a transition into hard bargaining rather than signal an end to efforts to achieve a compromise on the first post-election challenge of divided government.

Boehner suggested as much when one reporter asked if his comments meant he was breaking off talks with the White House and congressional Democrats.

‘No, no, no. Stop,’ he quickly answered.

‘I’ve got to tell you, I’m disappointed in where we are, and disappointed in what’s happened over the last couple weeks. But going over the fiscal cliff is serious business.’

Republican aides provided the first description of the White House’s offer, although Democratic officials readily confirmed the outlines.

Under the proposal, the White House is seeking passage by year’s end of tax increases totaling $1.6 trillion over a decade, including the rate hikes sought by Obama.

In addition to seeking tax increases totaling $1.6trillion over a decade, Obama also asked for approval by year’s end of $30billion to renew expiring jobless benefits, $25billion to prevent a looming January 1 cut in fees for doctors who treat Medicare patients and an undisclosed amount to help homeowners hit by the collapse in real estate values.

Counterattack: John Boehner claimed that the Democrats had not yet offered a credible deficit deal

The White House also wants a new stimulus package to aid the economy, with a price tag for the first year of $50billion, as well as an extension of the Social Security payroll tax cut that is due to end on December 31, or some way to offset the impact of its expiration.

In political terms, the White House proposal is a near mirror image of what officials have said Republicans earlier laid down as their first offer — a permanent extension of income tax cuts at all levels, an increase in the age of Medicare eligibility and steps to curtail future growth in Social Security cost-of-living increases.

In exchange, the GOP has offered to support unspecified increases in revenue as part of tax reform legislation to be written in 2013.

The GOP said the White House was offering unspecified spending cuts this year.

Those would be followed next year by legislation producing savings from Medicare and other benefit programs of up to $400billion over a decade, a companion to an overhaul of the tax code.

For the first time since the November 6 elections, partisan bickering seems to trump productive bargaining as the two sides maneuvered for position.

Ready to make an offer: Timothy Geithner sat down for talks with congressional leaders on Thursday

At issue is a bipartisan desire to prevent the wholesale expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the simultaneous implementation of across-the-board spending cuts.

The potential spending reductions, to be divided between military and domestic programs, were locked into place more than a year ago in hopes the threat would have forced a compromise on a deficit reduction deal before now.

Economists in and out of government warn that sending the economy over the ‘cliff” would trigger a recession.

To avoid the danger, Obama and Congress are hoping to devise a plan that can reduce future deficits by as much as $4trillion in a decade, cancel the tax increases and automatic spending cuts and expand the government’s ability to borrow beyond the current limit of $16.4trillion.

In the first few days after the elections, Boehner said he was willing to accept a deal that included new revenues, a long-time Democratic demand, and Obama has said he will sign on to savings from Medicare, Medicaid and other benefit programs that Democrats have long defended from proposed Republican cuts.

At the same time, both sides have worked to tilt the bargaining table to their advantage. As part of that effort, Obama travels to Pennsylvania on Friday to campaign for his tax proposal.

Boehner, who will begin a second term as House speaker early next month, has appealed to his rank and file to remain united.

At a closed-door meeting this week, he displayed polling data that showed the public would rather see loopholes closed than rates raised as a means of raising revenue for the government.

At the same time, there are tremors within the GOP ranks, with a small number of Republicans saying they are willing to let tax rates rise at upper incomes in view of the election returns, and others predicting legislation to that effect would pass the House if put to a vote.
