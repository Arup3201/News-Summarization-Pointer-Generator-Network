John F. Kennedy feared his son's obsession with flying would end in tragedy and warned the Secret Service to ease his security because 'nobody is going to shoot me,' newly released tapes have revealed.

In a startling premonition of his son's death, the President told an aide that he was worried about the time 'when he's old enough and wants to learn to fly'.

Tragically, he was far less accurate when predicting his own end, giving the Secret Service orders to 'relax' the levels of protection he was receiving after election in 1960 because 'nobody is going to shoot me'.

John F. Kennedy was infamously murdered while driving through Dallas in November 1963, collapsing in the back of his car, into his wife’s blood-splattered arms.

His son was killed when a plane he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1999.

JFK's opinions about his and his son's safety have emerged from a series of lost ’60s audio tapes unveiled by Helen O’Donnell, the daughter of the former president's aide Kenneth O'Donnell.

In
an article released this week, Miss O'Donnell quotes her father saying 
JFK was worried about his son's fascination with flying.

'John [Jr.] loved helicopters,' he said. 'He would race over and get on a helicopter, and when it was 
time for us to leave, he refused to get out of it ... The poor Secret 
Service would take John kicking and squabbling off the helicopter or the
plane.

'The president said to me: "The real question I’m going to have 
to face is when he’s old enough and wants to learn to fly".'

Kennedy was just 38 when a plane he was piloting went into the Atlantic off Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

The 1999 crash killed him, his wife Carolyn, 33, and her sister Lauren. 
Investigators said the probable cause was his ‘failure to maintain 
control of the aeroplane’.

In the article written by Miss 
O'Donnell, published in Town and Country magazine, she also discusses 
her father's account of how JFK viewed his own safety as president.

When the Secret Service boosted his 
protection after he won the election in 1960, the president is said to 
have told Mr O'Donnell: 'They’re making me uncomfortable. Nobody is going to shoot me, so tell them to relax.'

Less than three years later, JFK was shot dead while being driven with his wife Jackie in Dallas.

The article has been published just 
days after fresh light was shed on the Kennedys, with the release of 
audio tapes of Jackie being interviewed in the months after her 
husband's death. 

The tapes have been deemed surprisingly forthright for a woman who was never previously known for her opinions.

'Did she really think that?': Jackie O's grandchildren 'absolutely horrified' by her antiquated views on women

Even her own family have been shocked -
with her granddaughters said to have been 'absolutely horrified' by the
former First Lady's old fashioned views of the role of women.

In the 1964 interviews with Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr., the young widow described her marriage as 'a rather 
terribly Victorian or Asiatic relationship' and said she borrowed all 
her opinions from her husband.

She also said she didn't believe women should be politicians and described being subordinate to her husband on principle.

If the couple argued, 'I'd rush and say I'm so sorry. He loved that, because it's hard for men to make up first,' she said.

Rose and Tatiana Schlossberg, 23 and 21, who attended Harvard and Yale, were so shocked they asked their mother: 'Did she really think that?'

Liberal America has been shocked by the book of transcripts published 
today, which offer unique insight into Jackie Kennedy's views while and just after she was the First Lady.

In the tapes, she offers catty opinions 
on a host of the era's major personalities, including fellow political 
wives and Martin Luther King.

She described civil rights leader Martin Luther King as a ‘terrible’ man, who took part in orgies.

India’s future leader Indira Gandhi 
was ‘pushy, horrible... bitter prune’, while French president Charles 
de Gaulle was a ‘spiteful egomaniac’, according to Mrs Kennedy.

U.S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,
meanwhile, was accused of being a bitter and uninspired drinker and she
thought Sir Winston Churchill was ‘really quite ga-ga’.

Speaking about fellow political wives, she was particularly scathing.

Lady Bird Johnson, LBJ’s wife, was ‘sort of like a trained hunting dog,’ she said.

Of South Vietnam’s First Lady Madame 
Nhu and conservative congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce, she added: ‘I 
wouldn’t be surprised if they were lesbians.’
