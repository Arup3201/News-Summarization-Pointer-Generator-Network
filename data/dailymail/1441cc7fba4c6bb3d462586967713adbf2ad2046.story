This remarkable series of pictures shows just how much life has changed in the streets of London surrounding the River Thames in the last 150 years.

A unique series of photographs taken in the 1860s, using an early type of camera, showcase life in Victorian London for those living in the thriving and bustling streets next to the river. 

Landmarks Battersea Bridge, Cheyne Walk and Chelsea Physic Garden are easily spotted in the series of eight frames, set to go under the hammer at auction later this month, valued at around £500.

Echoes of history: Chelsea Old Church on the corner of Old Church Street and the Embankment. The church was painstakingly rebuilt after a parachute landmine blew the tower over onto the church, destroying most of it, in the Blitz in April 1941. For nine years the congregation carried on  in a ward of the adjoining hospital. From 1950 onward the church was reopened bit by bit and  reconsecrated in May 1958 by the Lord Bishop of London in the presence of the Queen Mother

The church's chancel (space surrounding the altar) probably dates back to the 13th Century and there is believed to have been a church on this site ever since Christianity first came to England. The Chapel on the South was rebuilt in 1528, as his private Chapel, by Sir Thomas More, the renowned social philosopher. More moved to Chelsea in about 1520 and built himself a house on what is now Beaufort Street - researchers once believed his skull was hidden in his monument at the church

Bridging centuries: Battersea Bridge in 1860. The bridge was commissioned by John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer and first opened in 1771. The structure was poorly thought-out and boats found it hard to navigate underneath. There were a number of accidents including serious injuries and deaths and the bridge would regularly need repairs after being rammed by ships.  In 1879 the dangerous and maligned wooden structure was taken into public ownership, and demolished in 1885

The original bridge, frequently hit by boats, was replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames and, perhaps as a result, one of the least busiest. Oil lamps were added to the deck in 1799, making Battersea Bridge the first Thames bridge to be lit. The bridge briefly attained national prominence in January 2006 when a 19-foot long female bottlenose whale became stranded in the water close to it

The grainy sepia images contrast with pictures taken today in the exact same spots the original photographer stood.

The skyline behind the old Battersea Bridge looks completely different to the new bridge, which was completed in 1890.

While the land directly behind the old bridge appeared to be undeveloped, the new pictures show towering skyscrapers and the iconic Battersea Power Station chimneys, which are currently being pulled down.

The Adam and Eve pub is pictured  with three large multi-paned square windows, balconies on all three levels and rickety steps leading down to the shore. The establishment was demolished to make way for the Chelsea Embankment. The pub was famously sketched by the American artist James Whistler, who adopted London as his home. This picture shows how the area was more socially and economically diverse in 1860.  In the background Chelsea Old Church is visible

Dirty origin: The Embankment was completed in 1874, planned by Joseph Bazalgette, who also designed Battersea Bridge.  It was part of the Metropolitan Board of Works' grand scheme to provide London with a modern sewage system and is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the age. In total, Bazalgette's scheme reclaimed 22 acres of land from the river using granite for the project, which was brought to London from Lamorna Cove in Cornwall

Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. It takes its name from William Lord Cheyne, an MP between 1681 until 1687. Most of the houses were built in the early 18th century and the houses used to front the River Thames until the construction of the Embankment. The trees in the picture above are seen today, albeit taller and thicker. The road's most prominent building is Carlyle Mansions, a block of flats built in 1886 and named after Scottish philosopher and writer Thomas Carlyle 

The road is one of the most desirable places to live in London and house prices have soared in value over the past decade. It is situated in Chelsea, which has been an upmarket locale since at least 1694 and was once described as 'a village of palaces'. Famous residents who have lived on Cheyne Walk include former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Rolling Stones guitarist Kieth Richards and lead singer Mick Jagger and esteemed novelist Vera Britain

Novelist George Eliot spent the last three weeks of her life there.

Henry James spent his last years at number 21.

Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull lived at number 48 in 1968.

Retail pioneer John Sainsbury lived at number 103.

Painter Joseph Mallord William Turner died there in 1851.

Crime writer Lionel Davidson lived at Carlyle Mansions from 1976 to 1984. 

A unique series of photographs taken in the 1860s, using an early type of camera, showcase life in what is now one of Britain’s most affluent areas. Pictured is Cheyne Walk, where men in top hats can be seen wandering along the dirty road which once lay on the bank on the river. The 150-year-old pictures form part of the Fine Arts and Antique Photography sale taking place at specialists Dominic Winters auction house in Cirencester, Gloucestershire

A two-bedroom house can sell for more than £8,300,000 in modern Cheyne Walk. Musician Mick Jagger, footballer George Best, actor Laurence Olivier, writer Henry James and architect Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as well as his father Sir Marc Brunel, who designed the Thames Tunnel, are all former residents of the street. In contrast to the photo taken in the 1860s, the street no longer sits next to the river thanks to the construction of Chelsea Embankment in 1874 

During the Victorian era, in Charles Dickens’ London, the cobbled streets are lined with small saplings, and paupers can be seen trying to scrape a living.

But now, the trees are much bigger and the paved roads are populated by cars rather than horse-drawn carriages.

The pictures form part of the Fine Arts and Antique Photography sale taking place at specialists Dominic Winters auction house in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. 

A spokesperson for the auctioneers said: 'It is a group of eight albumen print photographs, circa 1860s, including a two-part panorama of Battersea old bridge.'
