Alcoholics and junkies are getting almost half a billion pounds a year in sickness benefits, shock figures reveal.

An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has uncovered the true scale of welfare payouts to addicts, despite repeated attempts by Ministers to crack down on Britain’s benefits culture.

It can be revealed today that:

Wasted cash: Alcoholics and drug abusers are receiving welfare payments worth almost half a billion pounds a year (picture posed by model)

Last night, Tory MP Nigel Mills, who sits on the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ‘We should be helping them get off their addictions and get into work, not leaving them to be stuck at home, which is not good for them. The better way to spend public money is to help people get past their addictions and get them fit to work rather than paying benefits while they stay addicted.’

Tory MP Tracey Crouch, until recently chairwoman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse, said: ‘If addicts are simply given cash with no link to proper treatment and recovery, then nothing will ever change.’

Figures uncovered by this newspaper show there were 1,921,340 people across Britain on sickness benefits – now known as Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) – in 2013-14, receiving annual payments totalling £10.4billion.

Of these, 46,810 received the payment mainly because of their alcohol misuse and a further 28,440 had a ‘primary disabling condition’ of drug addiction. The alcoholics received £249.8million in ESA and the drug addicts £156.7 million.

On top of this, substance abusers still getting the old Incapacity Benefit last year received £26.3million, and a further £2.2million went on Disability Living Allowance.

It means addicts received £435million in sickness benefits in one year. Most will also be entitled to Housing Benefit – up to £400 a week for large families – and a discount on Council Tax. But even this underestimates the true number of addicts receiving sickness benefits, as many will qualify for ESA as a result of having other problems such as mental illness or physical disabilities.

Thousands of other addicts who are unemployed but deemed fit to work receive Jobseeker’s Allowance of £72.40 a week. Shockingly, the statistics obtained under Freedom of Information laws reveal that some of the addicts are teenagers. There were 1,030 alcoholics aged between 18 and 24 receiving ESA, along with 930 drug addicts of the same ages – and 20 aged under 18.

The greatest number of alcoholics on sickness benefit live in Glasgow (400), followed by Manchester (290), Edinburgh (250), Birmingham (200) and Bristol (190). Most drug addicts on ESA lived in Bristol (340), followed by Edinburgh (270), Glasgow (200), Bournemouth (150) and Aberdeen (140).

Junkies and alcoholics are also entitled to help with housing and council tax bills, as well as NHS rehab and detox treatment

The number of addicts claiming sickness benefit has barely changed despite attempts by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to get people back into work.

A Department for Work and Pensions document admits the proportion of alcoholics getting ESA ‘has remained largely unchanged’ while the number of drug addicts in the system has fallen by just 0.5 percentage points. This is despite the supposedly tough Work Capability Assessment, introduced to find out what activities claimants can take part in, as well as to weed out undeserving claimants.

The assessments are only meant to help people who have serious conditions that leave them unable to work. One recent case, however, shows that a drinker originally deemed to be simply lazy has been allowed to claim ESA. Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday show that the 30-year-old lives with his mother in Glasgow and had been paid sickness benefit for eight years when he was told to apply again under the new system.

He admitted he had no trouble with physical functions but had ‘no motivation to… get up, get dressed, get washed etc’ and that ‘my mother does almost everything for me’.

A nurse who interviewed the unnamed man said he ‘would drink ten to 12 cans of lager daily’ and had ‘anxiety and depression’ as well as ‘alcohol misuse’ for a decade – but added that his minimal activity ‘appears to be through choice rather than illness’.

He was initially refused ESA but appealed. In January 2013 a three-judge panel ruled that alcohol dependency did count as a ‘specific disease or bodily or mental disablement’ even if it was ‘self-inflicted’.

HM Courts & Tribunals Service confirmed last night that the man has since won a fresh hearing and is now receiving sickness benefit.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This Government has set out to change the way drug treatment is perceived and delivered - above all prioritising full recovery rather than short-term fixes.

‘There is an increasing rate of people coming out of rehab who have successfully completed treatment and left entirely drug-free - with the latest statistics showing a rise of 15,000 people in England compared to 5 years earlier.’

The DWP added: ‘Having a drug or alcohol addiction does not entitle someone to sickness benefits, but the associated long-term health effects may.

‘We are reforming disability benefits by introducing a new face-to-face assessment and more regular reviews - something missing under the old system.

‘But, ultimately, if a person’s health conditions render them genuinely unable to work, they need to be supported.’

The true cost of their habits will be close to £1billion a year as they are also entitled to help with housing and council tax bills, as well as NHS rehab and detox treatment.

One man who lay in bed drinking 12 cans of lager a day won the right to be paid sickness benefit even though health experts said he was simply lazy.
