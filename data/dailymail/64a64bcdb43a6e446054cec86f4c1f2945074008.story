Steve Brookstein, Leon Jackson and Matt Cardle have been quietly removed from a video to celebrate a decade of The X Factor.

Despite winning the ITV talent show, the trio's subsequent lack of commercial success has prompted their omission from the anniversary mash-up, which debuted on YouTube on Thursday.

Instead, the remaining series winners and some acts that even made as low as fourth place, such as Cher Lloyd, are celebrated as part of The X Factor legacy.

The 3.40 minute video features a mix of hits from the likes of One Direction, Leona Lewis and Little Mix.

Ahead of the show's 10th series, which returns to TV screens in August, six of the nine past winners are heralded in the video.

However, Series 1's Steve, Series 4's Leon and Series 7's Matt are all missing.

All three were dropped by their record label following disappointing sales of their debut albums.

Included amongst the winners are 
Series 2 champ Shayne Ward, Series 3's Leona, Series 5's Alexandra 
Burke, Series 6's Joe McElderry, Series 8's Little Mix and last year's 
winner James McArthur.

There's also runners-up Olly Murs and JLS, who ultimately both ended up more successful than the winners of their series.

From last year's series, fourth place Union J also make an appearance, with their recent top 10 hit Carry You.

Although they only managed third place in The X Factor in 2010, One Direction's debut single What Makes You Beautiful features in the promo.

Misha B and Amelia Lily, who was in fourth and third place respectively on the 2011 series, also appeared in the video.

The 10th series of The X Factor returns to ITV in August, with a 60 second version of the mash-up appearing on TV screens on Friday night.

During the past nine years on air, the show has produced  57 UK chart hits, including 33 number ones.

A show spokesman said: 'The Ultimate X Factor Mash-Up is a medley of hits from a selection of series winners and other artists.

'Having produced 57 UK chart hits across nine series, it wasn't possible to feature all of these songs, or the artists behind them on a three minute track.

The new series sees the return of original judge Sharon Osbourne alongside Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh.
