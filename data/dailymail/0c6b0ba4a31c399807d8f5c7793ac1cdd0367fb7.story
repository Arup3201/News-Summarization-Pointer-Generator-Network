David Cameron’s father-in-law last night revealed he has had an extraordinary ‘reconciliation’ with Mandy Rice-Davies - the former showgirl who claimed to have had an affair with his father during the Profumo scandal.

Miss Rice-Davies famously responded to the third Viscount Astor’s denials of an affair with the immortal line: ‘Well, he would, wouldn’t he?’

Writing in the Spectator magazine his son, the fourth viscount, said his father ‘never recovered his health and died a couple of years later’.

But Lord Astor said he had an unlikely reconciliation with Miss Rice-Davies at a performance of Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s new musical on the Profumo affair.

He said it was a ‘great plus’ to have met her, adding: ‘She was absolutely charming, and had very kind words to say about my father. It was a most unexpected moment - a reconciliation of sorts, and an uplifting footnote after all these years.

‘And what of the accusation? Well any girl of 19 who can get into the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, whether with something true or not true, has to be rather admired.’

Lord Astor, stepfather to Samantha Cameron, also revealed that the Profumo affair might never have happened if his father’s filly Ambiguity had not won the Oaks at Epsom in 1953. 

The proceeds from the win paid for the 
heated swimming pool at stately home Cliveden, where John Profumo saw 
showgirl Christine Keeler, a friend of Miss Rice-Davies, swimming naked 
at a party in July 1961.

Mr Profumo, then Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan’s government, was forced to resign in 1962 after it emerged he had an affair with Miss Keeler while she was also alleged to be having an affair with the Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov.

Lord Astor said Mr Profumo had met Miss Keeler after a party at Cliveden hosted by his father.

When the party relocated to the pool they met with a separate group hosted by his father’s colourful osteopath Stephen Ward, who surrounded himself with young showgirls.

‘Two worlds collided,’ Lord Astor said.

‘First
 into the walled garden was Valerie Profumo, who anxiously covered up a 
topless Christine Keeler with a towel before the other guests arrived. 
But Christine had already been spotted by Jack Profumo.’

Lord Astor said his father found Mr Ward’s treatments helped ease his migraines and neuritis.

He
 said he ‘fell under his spell’ and allowed Mr Ward to live in a cottage
 on the estate because ‘it suited him to be treated after hunting on 
Saturday’s.’

He went on: ‘I
 remember the afternoons by the pool when Ward and his girlfriends came 
to swim, with other families from cottages on the estate, usually when 
my father and stepmother were away.

'One of the girls taught me how to do backflips from the diving board, but sadly I don’t remember who she was. All were well-behaved because Nanny Greene, large and in full uniform, presided over the pool sternly. No bad behaviour got past her.’

Lord Astor says that Mr Ward was an ‘arch manipulator’ who was never a great fried of his father.

Mr Ward took a fatal overdose while awaiting the verdict on his trial for living off immoral earnings, of which he was later convicted.

Miss Rice-Davies’s famous comment was made when she appeared as a witness during the trial.

Lord Astor said: ‘It was a scandal that exposed the hypocrisy of the establishment that Ward so offended, exposed the dishonesty of the police and prosecuting authorities and of the security service. But I don’t think there were the real villains or heroes that a musical requires.

‘This is because, in the end, the characters in the Profumo scandal were all victims - victims of a maelstrom that none could escape. Few survived unscathed.’
