A man has been hospitalised after being trampled by a herd of cows while he was out walking his dog in the countryside.

Emergency services were called to a field in St Neots, Cambridgeshire last night and rushed the man to hospital.

The patient, said to be in his 60s, was badly injured in the accident and required specialist treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

Experts warned ramblers to beware of cows standing with their calves, as they could become violent while trying to protect their offspring.

The farmer who owns the land said that it was unclear whether or not the dog was on a leash when the man took it into the field.

Chris Wisson was called by police at the time of the incident and drove the five minutes from his farm in Godmanchester.

'The ambulance crews were just leaving when I got there,' the 35-year-old said. 'As far as anybody knows there was a gentleman there walking his dog in a field in with cows and calves.

'Whether or not he had the dog under control we don't know. It's just one of those things you don't want to happen, but unfortunately animals do follow their natural instincts.'

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'On our arrival, the man who we believe to be in his 60s received significant injuries.

'Following treatment, stabilisation and immobilisation by the ambulance crews, he was taken to the specialist trauma centre at Addenbooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire for further care.'

Adam Scott of the National Farmers' Union warned that people in the countryside should stay away from nursing cattle whenever possible.

'If you are walking through a field with cows in it is important to walk quickly and calmly,' he said. 'If you can avoid the cattle then walk around them.

'Most importantly do not get between a cow and her calves. This is where their natural instincts come in to play and you are at risk.

'If you have a dog please keep it on a lead. If the dog runs off do not try to protect it, the dog should be able to run away from the cows and will be safe.'

Neighbours suggested that the dog walker may not have been able to see the cows when he entered the field.

'A lot of dog walkers do go through the field,' said local resident Lisa Hendry. 'But there is a sign saying "Beware bull", and I use common sense and avoid going in there if I know a bull is around.

'However I know there is quite a slope, so it is possible you could walk in there without being aware there is a bull at the bottom.'

Police confirmed that they attended the scene, but said that there was no criminal offence committed.
