Photographs of Yosemite's iconic Half Dome peak have revealed the astonishing extent of California's historic drought.

The images, which show the peak in the third week of March each year between 2011 and 2015, reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year.

The snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late March and, as seen in the 2011 photograph, it previously covered peaks including the Half Dome.

But this year, the fourth consecutive year of drought in California, the 9,000-foot peak doesn't bear a single flake of snow.

Earlier this month, officials reported that the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which gives an indication of upcoming water supply, is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991.

The lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for California.

In response, state regulators voted earlier this month to impose a new set of water conservation rules, such as bans on watering yards and stopping restaurants serving customers water unless they specifically ask for it. 

Farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted, nearly twice the amount of last year, the New York Times reported. 

'It looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history,' state climatologists Michael Anderson told the Times. 'Unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in March, we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here.'

But the Half Dome peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month.

Earlier this month, the United States Department of Agriculture noted that as well as California, droughts are ravaging Nevada and Utah and also parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington and Oregon.

The photographs were taken by the Yosemite webcam provided by Yosemite Conservancy, which is funded by donations. While all years show the peak on March 19, the 2014 image shows it on March 17 as a March 19 photograph was not available.

Warming temperatures: But by March 2013, the peak is drastically different - with far less snow as temperatures stay higher

Depleting: The following year, 2014, also shows far less snow than in previous years as drought ravages states on the West Coast

Dry: By March this year, the fourth consecutive year of drought in California, the peak barely shows a flake of snow
