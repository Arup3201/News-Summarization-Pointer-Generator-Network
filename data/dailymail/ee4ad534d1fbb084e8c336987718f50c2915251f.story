This is the incredible moment a Malaysian mugger is given a taste of his own medicine.

Astonishing footage has surfaced of a woman turning the tables on a bag-snatcher, riding off on his scooter after he robbed her purse in broad daylight.

The CCTV vision, which was captured somewhere in Malaysia, shows the hijab-wearing woman walking down an alleyway when the mugger pulls up beside her on a moped.

The mugger pounces on the woman, snatching her purse with weapon in hand and bolting away on foot. But the overhasty assailant overlooked one imperative thing: his unmanned vehicle.

The quick-thinking victim swoops on the scooter, riding off as the panicking thief chases back in vain.

Uploaded to Facebook this week, the clip has received over 40,000 views. Some web users have voiced their support for the act of reprisal against a widespread problem in Southeast Asia.

Snatch theft is the most frequently reported crime in Malaysia, and one that’s on the rise: according to TheMalayMailOnline, the crime increased by 23.4 per cent in 2014, prompting authorities to deploy more police personnel at hotspots such as Kuala Lumpar.

An apparent lack of police control has led to some victims attempting to take justice into their own hands, sometimes with tragic consequences.

The theft is often committed on motorbikes, which offer thieves an escape route. But this can end fatally when victims refusing to let go of their belongings are dragged to their death.

Last year, a 26-year-old woman in Slim River died after sustaining injuries to her head caused by a motorcycle riding mugger attempting to snatch her necklace.
