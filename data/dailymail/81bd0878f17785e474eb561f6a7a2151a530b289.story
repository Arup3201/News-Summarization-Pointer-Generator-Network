Manchester United will make a decision about the option to buy Radamel Falcao in April and not in the next few days.

Reports in Spain have indicated United will rubber-stamp the Colombian's permanent move from Monaco next week but the English club put a season-long loan in place for good reason.

They wanted to see how he performed over the course of the season following his cruciate repair last summer and their purchase option is at end of the season.

The 28-year-old has scored three Premier League goals this season.

United, meanwhile, have yet to make any contact over a move for Everton full back Seamus Coleman.

The Republic of Ireland defender, bought by David Moyes for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers, is rated at around £30million by Everton and is happy at the club.

United are looking for a right-back and Coleman ticks all the boxes, he will be on their list, however, Chelsea are widely expected to make an offer for the 26-year-old and hope to buy him in the summer.

United are interested in bringing Everton right back Seamus Coleman to Old Trafford
