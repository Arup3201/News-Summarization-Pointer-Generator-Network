The pregnant teenager accused, along with her boyfriend, of the gruesome murder of her socialite mother has complained about the couple's 'racist' treatment after they were given a KFC meal in jail. 

Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, are both behind bars in Bali after being charged with murdering Sheila von Wiese Mack before stuffing her body into a suitcase while at a luxury hotel.

Despite the possibility of facing death by firing squad if found guilty, the pair are said to be outraged by the the assumption that they would want to eat fried chicken because they are black.

It is 
believed that Mr Schaefer was particularly angry with the offering as he
 suggested KFC was a meal for the lower echelons of society, newscom.au reports.

Police
 were taken aback by the allegation, claiming that in Bali KFC is 
expensive for the average income earner and not at all for the lower 
wage earners.

Djoko
 Hari Utomo, chief of police for the Balinese capital, Denpasar, said: 
'Heather complains about the food and that she is not being well-treated
 in jail, nevertheless police treat the prisoners all the same.'

The body of Sheila von Wiese Mack is set to to be flown back to Chicago on Wednesday following the socialite's gruesome murder in Bali last week

Countering the couple's bizarre claim, he added: 'We have already given treatment that is more than normal. We give special attention to her as she is still young. This is a transition period for her.'

Police in Bali have revealed that the suspects may be taken to the USA to stand trial, NBC NEWS reports.  

The broken and battered body of Mrs Mack looks set be flown back to Chicago on Wednesday with an FBI agent posted in Bali currently making arrangements with the US Embassy.

It is believed that the 62-year-old, who had gone on a relaxing ten-day holiday, was bludgeoned to death with a heavy glass ashtray and vase - with such violence that both objects shattered. 

In what police Commander, Djoko Hariutomo, described as a ‘desperately wild attempt’ to get rid of the body, Mrs Mack was jammed into a suitcase, which was then loaded into a taxi by Mr Schaefer.  

Both he and Heather Mack then  left the driver waiting outside the St. Regis Resort -  where they had been staying - telling him they would return shortly.  

After waiting for two hours, the driver noticed blood seeping from the case and drove to the police station, where the gruesome discovery was made.

The following day, police tracked down Heather Mack and Mr Schaefer - who were found asleep in a hotel in the Kuta area of Bali, six miles from the St. Regis resort and close to the island's international airport.

Curious details continue to emerge about what is already a bizarre inquiry. 

Mrs Mack and her daughter, Heather, are said to have had a tempestuous relationship for years with police being called to their Chicago home 86 times between 2004 and 2013

The Jakarta Post reported that the room Mrs Mack was killed in - and where a ‘cleansing ceremony’ to rid it of evil has been conducted by a Hindu priest - was not hers, but was being used by Mr Schaefer.

Pathologists have ascertained that she suffered asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably been killed in that room between 6.45am and 10am last Tuesday.

During her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered - suggesting Mrs Mack had fought back while being attacked.

Dr Dudut Rustyadi, the forensic chief at Sanglah hospital morgue in Denpasar, said: 'From the wound, we found violence using blunt objects. 

'We found many wounds, open wounds and bruises, including wounds on her left arm. We allege that the victim fought.' 

In the hours leading up to her murder, Mrs Mack had been seen on CCTV footage walking around the hotel lobby at 3.45am, for reasons that have not been suggested by police.

But officers have revealed that one sequence on security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Mr Schaefer about who should be paying the hotel bill. 

She was heard by staff telling her daughter that she had paid for Mr Schaefer’s air fare to Bali so the two of them should pay the bill. 

It was not clear if she was referring to Mr Schaefer’s room, which he is believed to have been sharing with Ms Mack.

But senior police said today that there appeared little doubt that in the hours before she was brutally murdered, Mrs Mack appeared to be a troubled woman. 

Detectives are trying to establish if she had gone to the room to continue confronting the young couple in the early hours of the morning.

A worker at another Bali hotel, who has friends at the St Regis, said he had been told that Mrs Mack was distressed that her daughter was two months pregnant - a fact confirmed by the MailOnline last week.

It is not known who the father is, but police said Mr Schaefer was the obvious candidate.
