It sounds like the perfect toy - a robot that you can not only control with your smartphone, but also design and build into any shape you want.

And you don’t need to know computer code, advanced robotics or electrical engineering to get started.

In fact, all that's required is the ability to match up colours, a little imagination and $59 (£37).

Modular Robotics is seeking $100,000 from Kickstarter backers so that it can offer kits early next year

Colorado-based Modular Robotics has been designing its build-your-own robots, called Moss, over the past two and a half years.

The company recently launched the robot on crowd funding website Kickstarter to help begin the production process and is now $34,110 towards its $100,000 goal.  

The unique modular design use magnetic balls as joints and hinges and has no external wires.

The kits come as individuals cubes that are designed to snap together to make a static structure.

Each cubes has a colour-coded connecting face to help signpost how it needs to be joined up to other blocks’ various functions to work.

A Bluetooth module can also be attached so that anyone can control their customised robot using a smartphone or tablet.

Other modules allow users to include additional power, motion and sensing capabilities.

A Bluetooth module can also be attached so the customised robot can be controlled using a smartphone or tablet.

Other modules allow users to include additional power, motion and sensing capabilities.

Each robot is powered with a  lithium polymer battery and charging is done via a Micro-USB cable.

Modular Robotics hopes Moss will open up the world of robotics to younger children who can create their own designs.

It’s offering a number of kits to Kickstarter backers starting at $59 (£37) for a simple starter kit that lets you build a light-sensing robot.

An advanced kit that lets you build a Bluetooth-controlled car will set you back $379 (£236).

The kits are expected to begin shipping early next year.
