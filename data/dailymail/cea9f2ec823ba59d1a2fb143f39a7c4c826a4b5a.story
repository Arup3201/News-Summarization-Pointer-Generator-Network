Modern British men are more hands-on than ever before when it comes to household chores, according to a new survey.

Researchers found that millions of men are more than happy to tackle a range of tasks their fathers would rarely encounter, with one in ten doing the bulk of the cleaning, polishing and dusting in the home. 

In fact, one in five men are in charge of cooking dinner every night, while one in ten regularly do the family washing.

A new survey has found that British men are more involved in household chores than ever - with 60per cent happy to prepare dinner every night and do the washing up afterwards as well

The study of 2,000 modern couples found the gender roles in the home are now being rewritten, with more than three quarters of women saying they are happy to tackle jobs that might previously have been tasked to the man of the house such emptying gutters and mowing the lawn.

The research, conducted by Karcher, also found two thirds of women will actively attempt jobs around the home their mum might have avoided or just left to the man of the house.

Suzi Perry, star of F1 and former presenter of The Gadget Show, commented on the findings: 'The times really are changing and so it probably wouldn't come as a surprise that more men are helping out around the home compared to several decades ago.

'Nowadays, relationships are more like teamwork and we help our partners with the upkeep of the house and garden.

'Brits are working longer hours now as well so if domestic chores were only to fall on the lap of one person, they may find family life harder and their day more stressful.

'We all know that a problem shared is a problem halved, and this should also reflect the thoughts of many towards household chores.

one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend, while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking

'So it's encouraging to see so many Brits taking on tasks they wouldn't once have been expected to do.'

The study revealed more than half of men feel they do much more domestic work around the house than their fathers ever did in terms of chores.

Meanwhile, 41 per cent of women confessed to doing less around the house than their mum did, which is believed to be because gender roles in the home were much stricter.

It was also revealed that more men are happy to do the hoovering round the house as well as the washing up and the gardening.

And six in ten men said they would be willing to sort the dinner every night and the washing up afterwards as well. 

Other jobs that men are happy to do around the home were found to be ironing, tending to the kids and cleaning.

But they'll also gladly wash the patio or use the pressure washer when it's needed - although this is a job they'll share with their wife or partner.

Not only are men happy to take on the tasks their fathers once would have declined to do, they also believe they are better than their partner at completing them.

In fact, one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking.

Furthermore, one quarter of men think they are better at doing the washing up than their partner, and one in six even think they can do the ironing more efficiently.

So it may not come as a surprise that 84 per cent of UK adults in a relationship believe the modern generation of men should be happier to do any of the kind of cleaning, washing or other domestic chores around the home.

Suzi Perry added: 'The modern generation of Brits are keeping up with modern views of daily living.'

Phil Springall, Karcher UK Home and Garden Marketing Manager said: 'It's interesting to see just how gender roles have evolved in the home and how we're all a bit more open to sharing the load.

'The results show that both men and women alike are up for swapping jobs in a way that maybe the generations before weren't.'
