Football may be the national religion.

But Italy has found itself in a spot of bother, after running an advert with Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue dressed in an Italian football shirt.

The Catholic Church in Brazil says the use of the statue’s image is blasphemous and is threatening to sue for up to €7 million.

The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro said that 'exploiting the image of Christ the Redeemer is a crime'.

But Italy has found itself in a spot of bother, after running an advert with Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue dressed in an Italian football shirt

The advertisement, which shows the figure, one of the world’s best known landmarks, dressed in the azure blue Italian shirt, was part of state broadcaster Rai's World Cup campaign.

The two minute clip features a Capoeira dancer in the strip, and children, wearing the Italy kit, playing football in the street before ending with the image of the statue wearing the blue shirt with ‘Italia’ written on the back, alongside the slogan ‘Brazil awaits us’.

The Catholic church in Rio di Janeiro, which owns the image rights for the statue, said it was 'disrespectful' and compared it to 'a Brazilian television channel making an advert in which mulatto girls engaged in indecent behaviour with the gladiators of the Colosseum.'

Christ the Redeemer is one of the most famous religious statues in the world

Lawyer Alessandro Maria Tirelli, who notified Rai of the potential lawsuit, told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano ''The archdiocese is outraged.'

Edio Costantini, president of the Italian Sporting Center (CSI), a Vatican sports organisation, told the newspaper: 'We live in a world that has put God on the bench'.

'At a time when religious values seem to have become insignificant and everything is commercial it’s right to feel indignation.’

The advert has since been withdrawn by Rai.

British bookies Ladbrokes have also produced an advert featuring the Christ Redeemer wearing a football jersey and today a hot air balloon in the likeness of the statute, wearing the colours of Australia's football team, floated over the Melbourne skyline in Australia today.
