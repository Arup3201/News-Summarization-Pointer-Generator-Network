Elsa had no time to build a snowman, or even play fetch.

The devoted Canadian yellow lab was on a mission to help shovel her family's snow-covered backyard hockey rink.

Ignoring the tennis ball nearby, Elsa meant business when she bit down on the handle of a big blue shovel.

The dog, from Guelph, Ontario, confidently shoveled a straight path, even as she struggled to maintain her grip mid-way. 

Elsa's owner Greg Cox tweeted the clip out to his followers and tagged ESPN sportscaster John Buccigross, according to Huffington Post Canada. 

Cox wrote: 'So my Lab is ready for some hockey, are you @Buccigross @NHL ?? #backyardrink #Canada #hockey #puppy'. 

Buccigross, who wrote a weekly NHL column for ESPN's site for 10 years, tweeted Cox back and said 'Greg, that is beautiful!' 

Elsa then confidently shoveled a straight path. Her owner, Greg Cox, shared the video on Twitter and YouTube, even tagging Budweiser to ask if they needed 'a new lab' for their commercials

Cox said the family never taught Elsa how to shovel snow. 'She watched us do it many times and loved being out there, so who knows?' he wrote 

Greg also tweeted the clip out to ESPN sportscaster John Buccigross and said his daughter Claire, who named Elsa, can be heard cheering her pup on in the background

The proud owner also tagged Budweiser in a separate tweet and asked them if they needed 'a new lab' for their commercials, alluding to their much-loved recent puppy advertisements.

When one Twitter user asked Cox how the family managed to teach Elsa the trick, he said she had never been trained. 

'We didn't teach her at all,' he wrote back. 'She watched us do it many times and loved being out there, so who knows?' 

Cox also shared the video of Elsa on YouTube, where the 11-second clip has already been watched over 13,000 times since it was posted yesterday.
