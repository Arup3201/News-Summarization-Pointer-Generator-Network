Hershey's has launched a legal battle to drive British chocolate brands out of New York City.

The American candy firm claims snacks like Cadbury's Creme Eggs, Nestle Toffee Crisp bars and Nestle Yorkie bars from across the Atlantic are too similarly packaged to their own products - and do not adhere to FDA guidelines.

If successful, the bid would strip British specialist stores such as Tea & Sympathy and Myers Of Keswick, in New York's West Village, of one of their key selling points.

According to Hershey's, LLB Imports has already agreed to block Cadbury's from US borders and they are pressing to drive out other products including Maltesers and Rolo. 

Controversy: The Hershey's Co. claims they have exclusive rights to make its own FDA-approved version of Cadbury's Creme Eggs under the same name. The law suit has enraged British specialist stores

Affecting business: New York City's British store Tea & Sympathy are petitioning against the law suit

'It's just another thing to make everybody miserable,' Nicky Perry, owner of Tea & Sympathy, told DNAinfo. 'Why are we having a fight about chocolate? I mean, chocolate!'

In the suit against LLB Imports, The Hershey Co. states that it holds exclusive rights to sell their own versions of Creme Eggs, Maltesers, and Rolo chocolates under the same names - but the recipes are different.

While Hershey's insists their recipe uniquely adheres to FDA guidelines, Perry insists the British versions taste better.

The case also states that Toffee Crisps candy wrappers are too similar to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups' wrappers.

'Too similar': The lawsuit says Toffee Crisp bars are too similarly packaged to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups

Infringement: Hershey's is calling for the British competition to be driven out to protect their brand

And Yorkie bars could be confused with the similarly-named York Peppermint Patties.

Enraged customers of Tea & Sympathy took to Facebook.

One wrote: 'I'm a proud American but I hate Hershey's and have loved Cadbury's since I was a kid.'

Another said: 'Hershey's chocolate is pure garbage ... another attempt to monopolize the market with a substandard product!' 

'Sounds the same': Yorkie bars, made in Britain by Nestle, sound the same as York Peppermint Patties

Legal battle: Although York patties are packaged and shaped differently, Hershey's claims it is an infringement

Hershey's spokesman Jeff Beckman said the lawsuit has prompted LBB had already agreed to stop importing British Cadbury products as a result of the lawsuit. 

'It is important for Hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a Hershey name or trade dress,' Beckman said.

'Hershey has always vigorously protected its brands and will continue to do so whenever we believe that others have infringed on these valuable intellectual assets.'
