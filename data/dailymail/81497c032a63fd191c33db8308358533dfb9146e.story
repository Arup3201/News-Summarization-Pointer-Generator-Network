David Gandy has long had a hold of the male modelling scene on the British High Street.

A model turned designer for M&S, he has lent his face as well as his fashion opinion to prestigious British brands - even writing articles for UK publications like Vogue, GQ and the Telegraph.

But hot young American hunk Sean O'Pry, it seems, is hot on his heels with a jaw-dropping campaign for Next.

Sean was named the most successful male model in the world on models.com in September 2013

The 25-year-old from Kennesaw, Georgia may be wrapped up in woolly knits, but manages to make even Christmas jumpers look sexy.

It's no surprise as he was crowed the world's highest earning model - with Gandy following in second place.

And he now adds British High Street giant Next to his abundance of prestigious clients including GAP, Viktor & Rolf, ALDO and many more.

Following an autumn / winter campaign, he models the label's more smart and seasonal styles in the new shoot.

He's pictured sipping a cappuccino and deep in thought by the river dressed in garments that showcase on-point styles including knitwear, outerwear and even dapper, tailored suiting.

Buy just who is he, and how did he become the world's top earner?

Discovered at the age of 17 on MySpace, O'Pry has been hard at work ever since, landing major ad campaigns for fashion greats Versace, D&G, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Ralph Lauren.

But if that's not ringing any bells, you're almost guaranteed to recognise him from his fragrance work last year.

O'Pry's signature brooding stare is featured on those ubiquitous ads for Jil Sander's Ultrasense and Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb.

All this hard work is certainly paying off.

In September 2013, he was named the most successful male model in the world on models.com. He has held this position on the top 50 international male models list for two years.

According to Forbes magazine, it's estimated that O'Pry, managed by VNY Model Management, earned £940,000 ($1.5 million) in 2013 making him the world's highest paid male model.

With £870,000 ($1.4 million) in the bank, Dolce & Gabbana favourite David Gandy, 34, was a close second, while Simon Nessman's £690,000 ($1.1m) secured third place on the list.

A cool million isn't bad but it's loose change compared to what O'Pry's female counterparts make. Gisele Bundchen, the world's top earning female model, raked in £26,131,591 ($42 million) in 2013.

Sean's also modelled for Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Armani and many more. 

In a recent interview Sean, a man's man, said he likes to golf and restore cars in his spare time.

We hope to see lots more of him soon...
