If you're sick of walking around with an embarrassing gape in the front of your blouse, then Marks & Spencer could have the answer.

The high street favourite has developed a 'No Peep' shirt, which uses a hidden placket - a finished opening that allows for movement - and concealed extra buttons to banish gaping for good.

Although the innovation is currently limited to a couple of shirts in the Autograph range, from August, all shirts sold by the brand will include the 'No Peep' placket.

No more embarrassment: Marks & Spencer's new 'no peep' shirts have hidden buttons and an extra placket

'In the past, feedback sessions have found that many of our customers have had issues with their shirt buttons gaping open to reveal their undergarments,' said M&S Collection's Head of Design, Neil Hendy.

'In response to this we have developed the No Peep shirt. It’s ideal for women with a bigger bust but also helps provide a cleaner line for all shapes.

'They have been so popular since the launch in March that we will be incorporating this technology into all M&S Collection shirts with a placket by the end of July.'

No Peep technology isn't the only design innovation made by the high street retailer in recent months.

Last week, the retailer announced the launch of the 'Drop A Dress Size' dress, which uses a supportive lining to create the illusion of a slimmer physique.

According to M&S, the slimming dresses give a more defined waist and a smoother silhouette thanks to the lining, which is made from fabric used in the retailer's shapewear line.

Marks & Spencer has had a rough ride in recent years with commentators and customers deriding collections as dowdy and unflattering.

That however could all be about to change thanks to the introduction of useful innovations such as the no peep shirt and the appointment of Jaeger's former CEO Belinda Earl as the retailer's new style director.

'I want women to be proud of a garment when they take it off and hang it on the back of a chair,’ Earl, who is also behind the no peep innovation told MailOnline columnist, Liz Jones.

Earl, who says she is most proud of the brand's £25 no peep white shirts, added: 'Buttons are concealed so it stops you gaping, which is great if you have a big bust.’
