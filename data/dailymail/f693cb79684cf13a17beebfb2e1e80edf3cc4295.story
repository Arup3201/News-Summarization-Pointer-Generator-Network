Detroit Lions’ stars Louis Delmas, who is black, and Tony Scheffler, who is white, have revealed they often use racial slurs when greeting each other.

The two players have spoken out about their use of provocative language after Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was famously caught on video earlier this month using the N-word at a Kenny Chesney concert.

Cooper was quickly forced to make a public apology and agree to undergo counseling, but his fellow professional's admission to using similar language isn’t an attempt to excuse his behavior.

Delmas and Scheffler say they’ve earned the right to use such language around each other because they have a strong bond of friendship that goes beyond simply playing for the same team.

The pair have known each other for 10 years, going back to when they were both at Western Michigan University and Scheffler, then a senior, took the freshman Delmas under his wing.

They've revealed to the Detroit News that typical banter between them consists of Delmas saying ‘Hey, cracker’ and Scheffler responding with ‘How’s my n*****?’

‘Me and [Scheffler] have a relationship many people do not have - both black and white,’ Delmas told the newspaper.

‘I look at him like my brother. I love him to death. He greets me, ‘What up, n*****?' But I understand it. So I say, 'What's up, cracker?' But we would never take it outside the building.’

Scheffler says he is well aware of the history of the word and the sensitivity he must apply.

He says he would use it in relation to another teammate that and that he never calls Delmas the N-word outside the dressing room or in front of his family.

'I treat Louis like a little brother,' he said. 'He knows my wife and kids. He calls me "white boy" and "cracker." We go back and forth with it and we are both comfortable with each other.

'I can't say the same with other relationships in the locker room or how other guys would feel about it. So it is a tough dynamic when you are using those types of words. Everybody does not react the same.'

Both players are adamant that such provocative language is okay within the confines of the Lions practice facility, it isn’t acceptable anywhere else.

With regards Cooper's recent drunken rant, Delmas believes he deserves his punishment and 'needed to learn a lesson.'

‘The way the public blew up the [Cooper] situation, it should be blown up that way because he needs to learn a lesson. You can't say that. You will never see me going outside the building calling someone cracker. You can't do that.'

'We know each other so well that it just comes out,' said Delmas talking of his banter with Scheffler.

'And when it comes out, we don't take it personally. We love each other to death. But outside here it is a word that should not be used.'

Cooper was excused from team activities to undergo sensitivity training earlier this month after his racist rant came to light

The wide receiver shouted 'I will jump that fence and fight every n***** here,' at Lincoln Financial Field, the Eagles' home field, after a Kenny Chesney concert on June 9.

Despite his quick apology, Cooper was excused from team activities and admitted to sensitivity training, as well as paying an undisclosed fine leveled by the team.

'I owe an apology to the fans and to 
this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did 
was wrong and I will accept the consequences,' Cooper said in a televised apology.

'This is kind of the lowest of lows. This isn't the type of person I want to be portrayed as. This isn't the type of person that I am.

'I know no one in Philadelphia is happy with me right now. I accept that. I just hope they see the true me. And accept my apology.'

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to say if the league would take further discipline.

'The NFL stands for diversity and inclusion. Comments like this are wrong, offensive, and unacceptable,' Aiello said.

The tape, obtained by Philadelphia sporting blog Crossing Broad, shows Cooper, dressed in a sleeveless red and black plaid shirt and with his blonde hair in a ponytail, push a man's hand off his shoulder before launching into the tirade.

It's not clear what his companion said immediately prior to the remark.

No excuses: 'I owe an apology to the fans and to this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did was wrong and I will accept the consequences,' he tweeted

He then brushes his hand away again and turns around, at which point a bottle of beer is clearly visible in the footballer's hand.

Afterwards, the country star pulled Cooper, teammate Jason Kelce and coach Chip Kelly on stage to perform 'Boys of Fall.'

Cooper was a fifth-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. He had 23 catches for 248 receiving yards last season for the Eagles.

He is expected to compete for a starting wide receiver job to replace the injured Jeremy Maclin.
