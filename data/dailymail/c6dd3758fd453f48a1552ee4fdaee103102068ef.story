A former police officer suspected in the deaths of two women whose bodies were found in suitcases dumped on a rural Wisconsin highway said he killed the women during separate meetings at hotels to have rough sex, a detective testified Thursday.

Steven Zelich, a 52-year-old security officer, has been charged with two counts of hiding a corpse in Walworth County, where the suitcases were found June 5 by highway workers cutting grass.

Authorities there have said they expect homicide charges to be filed in the counties where the women died, but Zelich's public defender Travis Schwantes said Thursday in court that the deaths were accidents that may not merit additional charges.

Judge Phillip Koss disagreed, saying the fact that Zelich hid the bodies, first in his home and car and then in tall grass along the road, indicated Zelich knew a crime had occurred.

Suitcase bodies: Steven Zelich appears in a Walworth County courtroom for his preliminary hearing Thursday, July 3, 2014, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. The former police officer has been charged with hiding a corpse after the bodies of two woman were found stuffed in suitcases deposited along a rural road in Wisconsin

Admission: A detective testified in court today that Zelich said he killed the women during separate meetings at hotels to have rough sex. The judge Zelich held for trial on the hiding a corpse charges and murder charges could follow

'If there's purely no crime, I'm not sure why one doesn't call 911 immediately, but beyond that, if there's no crime, it's not clear why these need to be hid at all,' Koss said as he ordered Zelich held for trial on the charges of hiding a corpse.

Walworth County Sheriff's Detective Jeffrey Recknagel testified that Zelich told him that he met both women in online chat rooms, set up dates for sex at hotels and killed the women after bondage sessions.

Recknagel said one woman, Jenny Gamez, 19, of Cottage Grove, Oregon, spent several days with Zelich at a hotel in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, before he killed her in 2012. The other woman, Laura Simonson, 37, of Farmington, Minnesota, died in November at a hotel in Rochester, Minnesota, authorities said.

Zelich kept the bodies hidden in suitcases before discarding them in early June, the detective said.

'He told me that he had been storing these bodies in the trunk of his vehicle and the smell was so strong that he decided he had to get rid of them,' Recknagel said.

Zelich worked for the West Allis Police Department from February 1989 until his resignation in August 2001.

A
 police report says a woman told officers in May 2001 that she met 
Zelich in a bar, went home with him and tried to flee when she thought 
she heard him get out handcuffs.

The report says Zelich said the woman, a prostitute, tried to steal from him and their struggle was his attempt to get the money back.

Zelich resigned from the department in August 2001 over the incident.

His attorney, Travis Schwantes, said he had not seen the report and could not comment.

He
 had been working as a private security officer when he was arrested 
June 25, the same day detectives wearing hazmat suits removed a 
refrigerator and large brown bags of evidence from his apartment in West
 Allis, a Milwaukee suburb.Walworth County authorities have said the 
women were killed elsewhere and they expect homicide charges to be filed
 in those other counties.

Recknagel
 says Zelich told him he killed the women accidentally after separate 
sexual encounters that were rough and included bondage.

Zelich's public defender has said the deaths may have been accidents.

The bodies were discovered June 5 in suitcases discarded along a rural road in Town of Geneva.

Investigators believe Gamez, who grew 
up as a foster child and had recently won a college scholarship, was 
killed in Wisconsin in late 2012 or early 2013 and that Simonson was 
killed in November 2013.

Gamez had moved from her home in Cottage Grove, Oregon, to be closer to a community college about 20 miles north in Eugene.

She lived with friends and visited her family, but eventually fell out of touch, said her foster mother, Lorraine Eriksen.

'I was surprised that I didn't hear from her,' Eriksen said.

'I
 knew she spent some time in California with friends, but her friends in
 Cottage Grove said she stopped texting with them, and after that we 
could not get in touch with her.'

She said Gamez, who had been in foster care with numerous families since she was five, 'was a joy to be around'.

Gamez gave birth to a son in 2008, and the boy's father gained sole custody in 2010, court records show.

She
 then went to live with Eriksen, who last saw her more than a year ago 
when Gamez visited her. Erikson had been 
wondering where the teenager was when police turned up on her doorstep 
asking for a hair sample.

Laura Simonson's father, Richard Wierson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his daughter had placed escort ads on Craigslist.

Wierson
 said she had struggled with mental illness since adolescence, and that 
her seven children were placed in foster care with him in 2010. One of 
her daughters, Alyssa, passed away last year.

Break in the case: Steven Zelich, 52, was arrested in connection to two female corpses found stuffed in suitcases found in Wisconsin in June

A
 missing persons investigation initiated by the Farmington Police 
Department determined Simonson was last seen November 2 in Rochester.

She was reported 
missing by her mother November 22, 2013 - about three weeks after she 
parked her van outside her family's home in Farmington.

Police
 in Rochester announced they have evidence suggesting that Simonson was 
killed at the Microtel Inn and Suites in town where the victim and 
Zelich allegedly stayed together on the night of November 2.

The next day, Zelich checked out of the motel but Simonson was no longer with him, police said. 

Following Simonson's disappearance,
 an ad was placed on the site SecondCityClassifieds.com claiming that 
the divorced mother of seven was mentally disabled and had been enslaved
 and tortured by Steven Zelich.

The ad titled 'Steven Zelich is a predator' described the former law enforcement officer as a 'sadist' who had enslaved Simonson, keeping her 'naked, handcuffed, shackled, and caged.'

'He has no intention of ever releasing this poor woman who suffers from various mental disabilities. She has been whipped and tortured by Steven Mark Zelich since November 2, 2013,' the ad read.

The writer provided Zelich's cell phone number and email address, urging online users to harass the man and flood his inbox with messages.

The ad also revealed Zelich as an avid practitioner of sadomasochism who had been active on the site Collarme.com under the user name 'mrhandcuffs.' 

That profile has since been deleted, but on the website Collarspace.com dedicated to the S&M lifestyle, a user by the nickname 'Mrhandcuffs' described himself as dominant and touted the virtues of having a long-term slave.

The profile was accompanied by a photo of a middle-aged man strongly resembling Zelich seated on a white couch.

'There is nothing better than a slave, tied tight, gagged, blindfolded, hooded, chained, caged...' he wrote.

'The slave I seek understands the incredible connection between owner and owned.'

According to Chicago Tribune,
 the 52-year-old licensed security officer also had been active on an online 
discussion board titled MasterB Slave Club, where he posted a similar message 
about 'seeking perm enslavement... ideally in a farm/caged situation.' 

Mr Handcuffs: Zelich has been active in the S&M community, posting on websites dedicated to that lifestyle under the name 'mrhandcuffs' about his desire to own a permanent slave

Gruesome find: Highway workers cutting grass outside Lake Geneva, Wisconsin on this road found two suitcases in tall weeds in a ditch. They were moved them to the side of the road. Officers investigated and found a body in each suitcase

According to a criminal complaint, Zelich told investigators he met the women online.

He said he killed Gamez in late 2012 or early 2013 in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Simonson in November in Rochester, Minnesota.

Gamez was identified through dental records, said Kurt Picknell, undersheriff in Walworth County, which includes Town of Geneva.

A
 highway worker first came across the suitcases containing the female 
corpses June 5 as he mowed the grass in Geneva, about 50 miles southwest
 of Milwaukee.

At around 3pm that day, another person saw the dumped bags by the road and called the police department.

Those
 suitcases contained decomposing human remains. Passersby say they saw 
flies when they got out to investigate the suitcases.

'It is one of the more horrific crimes I've been involved in,' said Geneva Police Chief Steven Hurley, who has worked for 36 years in law enforcement.

'It has taken a lot of twists and turns in the past few weeks.'
