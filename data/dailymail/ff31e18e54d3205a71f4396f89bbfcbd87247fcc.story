Authorities may have recovered an Alabama woman's body over the weekend - more than one month after she disappeared.

The body is that of Theresa Benn, the Talladega County Sheriff revealed to ABC 33/40 on Saturday -- though the affiliate station noted the Lincoln Police Department has not publicly identified the body.

'We had people on ATVs, on foot, and on boats,' Amanda Crowe with the Lincoln Police Department told ABC 33 40 of the multi-agency search for Benn.

The last sighting of Benn, 42, took place at Speedway Industrial Drive October 19, the news outlet reported.

'We're still asking for any information from the public,' Crowe also said. 'Anyone that might have saw something or have anything information that we don't already have to come forward.'

The Lincoln Police Department said in a Saturday release 'On this date at approximately 1:00pm, searchers located the body of a white female in the Jackson Shoals area of Choccolocco Creek. Positive identification of the body will be determined by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences pending their forensic investigation.

The release continued 'The search was conducted and coordinated by Lincoln police in conjunction with Texas Equusearch in hopes of locating Theresa Benn, a local woman missing since October 19, 2014.  

'Volunteers from Texas Equusearch, members of the community as well as off duty personnel from Lincoln Fire and Rescue, Etowah County Search and Rescue, Talladaga County Sheriff's Office, Talladega County DTF, and Calhoun County Sheriff's Office, took part in the search. The Lincoln Police Department would like to send a heartfelt thank you to all those who helped in the search.'

Disappearance: The last sighting of Benn, 42 took place at Speedway Industrial Drive October 19, not far from the Talladega Superspeedway 

Benn's family said in a November 17 statement to WIAT that 'Theresa’s husband, Kevin Dulaney, reported to police that he dropped Theresa off on the East end of Speedway Blvd near Mapco and Stuckey’s around 2 a.m. Sunday morning. Beyond this point in time, Theresa’s whereabouts are unknown.'

It continued, 'Theresa was reported wearing a black tank top, blue jeans with a rhinestone covered belt and pink and brown cowboy boots. She was carrying her purse and cell phone. Theresa currently has long dyed blonde hair (natural brunette). She is 5’5” and 108 lbs.' 

According to the affiliate station, Dulaney had said to cops his wife exited the vehicle in the middle of an argument between the couple.

Other searches via helicopter and in the water had not recovered Benn's body, Al.com reported earlier this month.

Authorities told the website that Benn got out of Dulaney's car due to her desire to head toward Talladega Speedway.

Crowe told Al.com at the time Dulaney had claimed Benn got out of the car around Easataboga Road, and that she had been heading toward Talladega Speedway.
