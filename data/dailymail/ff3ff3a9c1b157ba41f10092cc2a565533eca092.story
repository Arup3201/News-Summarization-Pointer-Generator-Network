A couple found dead in bed are feared to have inhaled toxic carbon monoxide fumes from a generator used during a power cut over the Christmas Holidays

Ken and Dorothy Swallow, 70 and 71, are understood to have been discovered dead in bed at home in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex by their daughter, Daryl Swallow.

Mr Swallow’s niece, Natalie Swallow, paid tribute to the couple and described her uncle as 'a good friend and a brilliant listener'.

She said: 'Ken was someone who always put others before himself. You could say he was Mr Dependable.

'He was an all round top chap. A total one off who was high on life.

'To lose both Ken and Dorothy is so, so sad. They will both be greatly missed but not forgotten.'

A Sussex Police statement said: 'Shortly after midday on Boxing Day relatives found an elderly couple dead in their home.

'There are no suspicious circumstances and it is thought the man and woman may have succumbed to fumes from a generator left running overnight following a power cut.

'An investigation into their deaths continues. Post-mortem examinations have been carried out.'

A police spokesman refused to give out the results of the post-mortem and said the details would be released at the inquest.

A close friend of the Swallows, John Buck, described the couple’s death as 'a real tragedy', describing him as a 'larger than life, charismatic person'.

The Times has reported Mr Swallow was a financial director at Charles of the Ritz, a cosmetics copmpany, in Burgess Hill, and the couple have a son and three daughters.

He was also a football club manager who worked with Ansty Rangers, Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath.

Inspector Andy Kundert, who is the emergency planning officer for Sussex Police, said anybody using a generator should make sure the area is well-ventilated to make sure poisonous fumes don't build up indoors.

An inquest was opened and adjourned on January 3.
