Top Gear writer Piers Ward got behind the wheel of the high-performance Honda, dubbed the ‘Mean Mower’.

Speedy: This one-off Honda lawnmower entered the record books today after being driven at a 116mph (187kph)

He took the machine to the IDIADA Proving Ground in Tarragona, Spain, with the task of beating the 2010 record of 96.5mph (155.3kph) made by a John Deere riding mower.

And Mr Ward ended up breaking the record by reaching 116.57mph (187.6kph) in the high-speed machine.

To give the 'cutting edge' vehicle its rapid performance, Honda fitted it with a 1,000cc superbike engine.

Garden chore be gone: Honda had to prove to Guinness it could cut grass like a conventional lawnmower. They found that it can mow a lawn at up to 15mph (24kph)

Top Gear writer Piers Ward got behind the wheel of the high-performance Honda, dubbed the 'Mean Mower'

Engine: VTR 1000F Firestorm 

Size: 1000cc

Power: 109hp

0-60: Four seconds

Maximum speed: 116.57mph (187.6kph)

Torque: 96Nm

Body: Honda HF2620 Lawn Tractor

Weight: 309lbs (140kg)

This gives it a greater power-to-weight ratio than a Bugatti Veyron and acceleration from 0-60mph in just four seconds.

The record was set in March with Honda confirming the top speed today.

Mr Ward, 33, said: ‘It felt surprisingly stable. You start accelerating and think, “that feels okay”, so you keep accelerating, and it still feels okay, so you keep accelerating, and accelerating? and it just tracks straight and true.

‘The biggest problem was wind resistance. It's a mower and was designed to do 12mph (19kph) max, so there's no aero - it just keeps trying to take your head off all the time.

‘Hence why I adopted my patented “Donkey Kong” pose.

‘Breaking the record felt superb. I grew up watching Roy Castle on Record Breakers.

‘So to have a modern-day Norris McWhirter say “Piers Ward you've broken a new world record” felt excellent.’

The speed was measured through a 328ft (100 metre) speed trap which was overseen by official timers, Timing Solutions Limited.

To meet Guinness World Records regulations the mower had to record the same run, in both directions, within an hour - with the average speed taken of these two runs.

Honda also had to prove to Guinness it could cut grass like a conventional lawnmower. They found that it can mow a lawn at up to 15mph (24kph).

The Mean Mower was designed and built in the UK by Honda's British Touring Car Championship partner Team Dynamics.

Engineers redesigned a Honda HF2620 Lawn Tractor from the ground up to create the Mean Mower.

To perfect the handling, BTCC champions Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden rode the mower and provided feedback to improve performance.

It was fitted with a custom-made six-speed gearbox and also boasted a custom-made Cobra sports seat.

Ellie Ostinelli, one of the organisers from Honda, said: ‘The original brief for Mean Mower was to create the world's fastest lawnmower - and now it officially is, by some distance.’
