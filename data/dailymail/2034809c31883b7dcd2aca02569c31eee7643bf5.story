A young man was stabbed to death at a party in the early hours of this morning, police said today.

The victim, believed to be in his 20s, was one of three men taken to hospital at around 5am after suffering knife wounds at a party in Tottenham, north London.

He was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at a north London hospital and the other two stab victims were being treated for relatively minor injuries. A murder inquiry was launched by police.

Investigation: The scene on Broad Lane in Tottenham, north London, this morning after a man died in the area

Officers and paramedics were called 
shortly before 5am to reports of a fight on Stamford Close. The two 
injured men taken to hospital were believed to be aged in their late 
teens or early twenties.

Three men have been arrested in connection with the incident and taken to a police station.

Shop worker Ozan Seran, 19, said he had heard the victim was of Somalian origin and had come to Tottenham for the party.

He said: ‘One of the customers said he's Somalian and was around 20. There aren't any Somali families around here so it looks like he has come into the area for a party.

‘People are really shocked, especially the older people. It's a quiet area. It's quite a close-knit community. There hasn't been any trouble around here for years.’

Ilvan Cokcilr, 34, who runs a newsagent’s on nearby Broad Lane, said: ‘When I opened the shop today I saw the road had been cordoned off.

‘The police told me there had been an
incident, but didn't say what. Customers have been coming into the shop
telling me someone had been stabbed and died. It's awful. He was only a
young man.’

A large cordon was set up around the 
area as forensic teams examined the scene. A white forensic tent could 
be seen opposite a taxi rank on Broad Lane.

Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘One male was pronounced dead shortly 
after arrival at hospital. He is yet to be identified. A post-mortem 
examination will be arranged in due course.

‘The second male suffered non-life threatening injuries. We await a further update as to his condition. The third male sustained minor injuries.

‘Officers from Haringey CID are investigating supported by colleague from the Specialist Crime and Operations Directorate. Inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

‘Three males have been arrested in connection with the incident.'
