A kissing booth in the US served up smooches with a difference because it was operated by dogs.

The unique attraction at the Indiana State Fair served up kisses with a bit more tongue than usual - selling the slobbery signs of affection to visitors for just $1.

Held at the event in Indianapolis, Indiana, the stunt was aiming to raise money and awareness about dogs up for adoption.  

The kissing booth at Indiana State Fair was operated by dogs and organised by Helping Paws

The adorable mutts were lending their lips to a good cause at the charity booth - all captured on camera and turned into an amusing slow-motion video.

The footage - compiled by students at Ball State University - shows is great detail the dogs slobbering over guests - who seem to delight in the affection. 

The canine booth was completely staffed by dogs and as the video shows, both the kissers and the people receiving the kisses had a ball.

The booth was set up by animal adoption advocates Helping Paws who were there to raise awareness of shelter dogs available for adoption. 

On its website, the charity writes: 'Helping Paws is dedicated to improving the lives of animals locally, and nationally; alleviating their suffering and elevating their status in society through the rescue and rehabilitation of animals in need.'
