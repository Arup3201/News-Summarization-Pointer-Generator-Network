A New York businessman who survived 9/11 was shot dead early Tuesday in his own Jamaica, Queens neighborhood.

Mohamed Hamwi, 48, was on his way home from the commuter train when he was shot in the face and chest.

While his money and belongings remained on his person, the mother of Hamwi's male partner still believes her son-in-law's death was a robbery gone wrong and not a hate crime.

Tragic: New York City police are searching for clues to why systems analyst Mohamed Hamwi, who survived 9/11 when he was late for work at the World Trade Center, was murdered in his own neighborhood early Tuesday

Gruesome: Hamwi was found here around midnight Tuesday and rushed to an area hospital, where he died around 1am. He suffered gunshot wounds to the face and chest

According to the New York Daily News, the Syria native was born Muslim but did not practice because of the religion's outlawing of homosexuality.

Police referred to Hamwi's partner as his husband. The two lived together and his husband's mother Zona Tomlinson lived in their basement.

Tomlinson spoke to reporters and was the one to identify Hamwi's body, neither of which her son could bring himself to do.

'He didn't want to see him like that,' said Tomlinson, 59. 'He was afraid of how he'd look.'

Tomlinson told the Daily News she whispered in her beloved dead son-in-law's ear, 'Thanks for everything.'

She said Hamwi was late for work on September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center and managed to miss the terrorist attacks.

Hamwi lived here with his husband and mother-in-law. His mother-in-law said she believes the crime was a robbery gone wrong, though Hamwi's money and belongings remained on his person

According to CBS2, Tomlinson supported his own mother, who lives in Syria, with finance sector job.

Hamwi was discovered shot around midnight. He was rushed to an area hospital but was pronounced dead around 1am.

'He was such a lovely son,' Tomlinson said. 'No mother wants to go through this.'

Meanwhile, area residents reacted as anyone might to such news: with fear.

'It makes me want to move,' said 67-year-old Carol Forbes.

Neighbor Eric Arrington told CBS2: 'It’s just very disturbing. You don’t want this to happen to anyone.'

'It’s just very disturbing,' neighbor Eric Arrington said. 'You don’t want this to happen to anyone.'

Hamwi still had his iPhone and $200 in cash with him when paramedics rushed him to the hospital. But Tomlinson stood firm that this was not personal.

'It had to be to rob him, but someone must have surprised (the robber) and run off,

'I don't know if maybe he fought back,' she said of her slain son.

Police were combing the area for clues by daybreak Tuesday.

They said they will also hunt down possible surveillance footage of the crime hopes it will sense some light on the loving husband and son's senseless death.
