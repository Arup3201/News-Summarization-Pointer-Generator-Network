More than one in three families are prepared to take children out of school during term time to avoid rip-off holiday prices.

Warning letters from head teachers and the threat of a £60 fine are apparently not enough to deter parents from breaking the rules.

New research shows the scale of rise in the cost of a family holiday once the schools break for summer is potentially more than £1,000.

Consequently, when families are suffering the longest cost of living squeeze on record many find taking a holiday in term time is the only way they can afford to take a break.

A price comparison by the Nationwide Building Society found a family holiday at Center Parcs during the official school summer holidays was £890 more - £1,928 versus £1,038.

Similarly, a family trip to Disneyland Paris was almost £400 more if taken during the official break.

Going further afield on a package holiday to Spain, which is the nation’s favourite summer destination, was more than £1,000 more once the schools break up.

Nationwide found that 37 per cent of parents admitted they had taken their children out of school to get a good deal on a holiday.

Government rules state that parents can 
be fined £60 per child for ‘unauthorised absence’ during term time. 
However, that is tiny in the context of the holiday price savings.

'With the current challenging economic environment, it’s no wonder that families are looking to shave their holiday costs'

Nationwide’s director of banking, Graham
 Pilkington, said: ‘With the current challenging economic environment, 
it’s no wonder that families are looking to shave their holiday costs.’

He said parents can try and stay within the rules and cut the cost of going away by using price comparison websites and retailer loyalty schemes, which offer money off hotel stays or visits to theme parks.

Mr Pilkington warned that while there are savings to be made, these have to be offset against the extra cost of childcare during the official school holidays when parents will be back at work.

A study published last year identified rising numbers of primary school pupils were playing truant, with more than 23,000 skipping lessons each day of the spring term this year.

Flexibility: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured in May 2010 at a school in Edmonton, north London) has announced plans to give schools greater freedom over the length of terms and holidays from September 2015

Parents who took their children on term-time holidays without permission were responsible for a fifth of ‘unauthorised absences’ recorded by primary schools.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans to give schools greater freedom over the length of terms and holidays from September 2015.

This could end the current system when most schools are off for the same six weeks in the summer, making them a captive market for holiday companies and airlines who cash in by hiking their prices.

Spreading the demand for holidays over a longer period through the summer months, with some schools breaking in early July, might lead to lower prices.
