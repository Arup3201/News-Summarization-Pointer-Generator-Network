Two young mothers who threatened police officers, spat at doormen and screamed racist abuse on drink-fuelled nights were told they needed to stop drinking by magistrates.

Carla Stanway and Nicola Wainwright, both 24, were told to act as 'role models' to their children after they fled an expensive restaurant without paying and were kicked out of a nightclub for stealing drinks. 

The pair, who both claim benefits, narrowly escaped jail over their ‘appalling behaviour’ – as a magistrate urged them to become better role models for their children.

After being thrown out of the 
nightclub, unemployed Stanway, who had given birth just three  weeks 
previously, told a doorman: ‘Go back to your own country you Polish 
b******.’

Wainwright, who claims working tax 
credits, then threatened the club’s staff, saying: ‘I’m going to get 100
n****** and do you up. You’re all going to be dead by next week. Hit me
and lose your job.’

When police arrived, Wainwright, who 
has a five-year-old son, lashed out violently at them and threatened one
female officer, saying: ‘I’ll punch your head in.’

It was while on bail for this offence 
that the pair went on another wild night out, where they racked up a 
food and drink bill of £115.

At it again: Later whilst on bail, the girls went out on another wild night, rattling up a £115 bill at Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand's high-class Rosso restaurant - only to become drunk and disorderly

But their raucous behaviour at 
Manchester’s Rosso restaurant, owned by footballer Rio Ferdinand, 
annoyed other diners. The pair were asked to leave – and fled without 
paying their bill.

Police found them at a nearby hotel 
and received a foul-mouthed volley of abuse. After Stanway was arrested,
a makeshift cosh – a billiard ball in a knitted sock – was found in her
handbag.

What Nicola Wainwright told bouncer

Stanway, from Newton Heath, 
Manchester, and Wainwright, of Failsworth, Oldham, appeared at 
Manchester magistrates’ court in short dresses and heavy make-up.

Both pleaded guilty to racially 
aggravated offences and making off without payment. Stanway admitted 
carrying an offensive weapon.

They walked free, but magistrates 
condemned them for their ‘appalling’ conduct and told them to set a 
better example for their children.

The magistrate told them: ‘These matters are serious and represent appalling and shameful behaviour.

‘You need to stop this drinking  
pattern and contribute to society  in a positive manner. You’re role 
models to your children – and you should be, rather than being drunken, 
ignorant people.’

But afterwards, Wainwright laughed and joked, whilst Stanway defiantly gave a two-fingered gesture to members of the public.

Earlier Dominic Geelan, prosecuting, 
said the first attack occurred after Wainwright, a self-employed 
hairdresser, and Stanway got ‘profoundly drunk’ at Sugar Buddha Lounge 
in the city on December 9.

Stanway was ejected from the club at 
1.45am after refusing to pay for a drink and both girls launched a 
racist rant at five bouncers and staff. Mr Geelan said: ‘When shown CCTV
footage, Stanway remembered little about the incident. She did 
apologise and express remorse, unlike Wainwright, who laughed.’

The second incident happened when the 
pair were celebrating Wainwright’s birthday on January 13. Mr Geelan 
said: ‘Their behaviour deteriorated in direct proportion to their 
alcohol consumption.’

David Philpott, defending, said his clients were remorseful, had admitted their guilt and had lost their good names.

The pair were each handed a 12-week 
custodial sentence suspended for 12 months. They were also ordered to 
serve a 12-month community order, abide by a three-month curfew and pay 
compensation to the nightclub and restaurant and their staff.
