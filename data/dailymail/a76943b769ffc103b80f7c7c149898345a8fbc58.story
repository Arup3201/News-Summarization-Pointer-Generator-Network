Louis van Gaal has named his first Manchester United squad as the club embark on their pre-season tour to America.

Van Gaal's 25-man party flew to America on Friday afternoon after a light training session at Carrington earlier in the day and included much of the club's senior team as well as numerous youngsters.Â 

Bebe and Patrice Evra, who have been linked with moves to Benfica and Juventus, were not in the squad, however. Brazilian midfielder Anderson also missed the trip after picking up a calf injury in training.

Other notable absentees included Javier Hernandez, Robin van Persie, Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini - who have been given time off after the World Cup.

Michael Carrick did not travel after undergoing ankle surgery on Thursday that could rule him out for the first two months of the season.

New signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw did travel alongside Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and David de Gea.

Youth-team products Sam Johnstone, Tyler Blackett, Michael Keane, Reece James, Jesse Lingard and Will Keane all made the cut, but there was no room for James Wilson and Tom Lawrence, who made their first-term debuts at the end of last season, or Nick Powell.

United will play their first match of the tour against the Los Angeles Galaxy next Thursday before taking on Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup. If they make the final, they will play a fifth match in Miami on August 4.

Goalkeepers: David De Gea, Anders Lindegaard, Ben Amos, Sam Johnstone.

Defenders: Rafael, Jonny Evans, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Tyler Blackett, Michael Keane, Reece James.

Midfielders: Ander Herrera, Tom Cleverley, Darren Fletcher, Ashley Young, Wilfried Zaha, Shinji Kagawa, Juan Mata, Antonio Valencia, Nani, Jesse Lingard.

Forwards: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney, Will Keane.
