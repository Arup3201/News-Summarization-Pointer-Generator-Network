A Palm Beach County, Florida driver of a bus for the disabled has been fired after video emerged of him tying up an autistic man with a seat belt on Monday.

Ilem Mintor says the unidentified 20-year-old just wouldn't stop opening the door of the vehicle, so he decided to act.

While what he did has now cost him his job and there's video proof of him tying up and cursing at the man, Mintor maintains he did nothing wrong.

Scroll down for video...

Evidence: Video shows driver of a Florida handicap bus Ilem Mintor yelling at a 20-year-old autistic man, then pointing and cussing at him, before reaching for the vehicle's seatbelt

Cruel? Mintor clearly then ties up the unidentified man, while continuing to yell. Since the footage has emerged, Mintor has been fired from Palm Beach County's Metro Mobile

Mintor told WPBF news that the man repeatedly tried opening the door of the bus and passersby even yelled for him to call police.

That's when Mintor pulled over and 18-year-old Amanda Tourino pulled out her cell phone and began recording the incident.

Footage clearly shows Mintor pointing and cursing at the boy.

He then can clearly be seen wrapping a seat belt around the boy's wrists, binding them together.

Mintor defended himself in an interview with WPBF.

'I say, "Don't do that, man,"' Mintor 
recalled to WPBF. 'And I grabbed a seat belt. I say, "If you keep doing 
that, I'm gonna wrap your hand and take you back home like this." I'm 
just giving him the pressure now.'

Defense: Mintor maintains that he did nothing wrong and says even passersby were yelling for him to call police as the man tried to open the vehicle door

But the video proves it was more than pressure and after Mintor bosses at Palm Tran and Metro Mobility saw the footage, he was fired.

'Metro Mobility is shocked by the actions that this driver took,' said attorney Neil Schiller said. 'In no way, shape or form does Metro Mobility endorse what the driver did. It's actually the opposite.'

'If I drive down the road and he fell out and another car hit him, what you gonna say,' asked Mintor in his own defense.

Meanwhile, Tourino's mother said the only reason Amanda recorded the footage is because she told her to.

According to Leigh Tourino, her daughter had complained about Mintor before. Tourino told her daughter to take out her phone and hit record if anything suspicious happened again.

'She did a good job,' Tourino told WPTV.

'She did a good job': Leigh Tourino, mother of the 18-year-old autistic girl who captured the footage that got Mintor fired, says her she'd heard about problems with the driver before
