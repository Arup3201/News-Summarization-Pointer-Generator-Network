Prince Andrew’s bid to save the Duke of Wellington’s battalion from defence cuts received a boost last night after reports that the Army chief behind the move plans to discuss the issue with him.

Well-placed sources said Major General Graham Binns, Regimental Colonel of the Yorkshire Regiment, was ready to reconsider his decision to cut the Army’s link with the victor of the Battle of Waterloo.

The 600-strong Duke of Wellington’s battalion, formally known as 3rd  Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment, will be one of the most high-profile victims of the Army cuts to be announced this week.

Boost: British soldiers take positions during clashes with gunmen in Basra, Iraq, in 2004. There are signs that the Duke of Wellington's battalion could be saved from defence cuts

The regiment is to be reduced to two battalions, but the Duke of York, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the Duke of Wellington’s battalion, currently serving in Afghanistan, is known to support moves to retain its historic name.

Prince Andrew last week spoke of his ‘passionate care’ for the soldiers in the battalion, prompting hopes of a U-turn.

He also dined with officers of the Yorkshire Regiment last week.

Former officers in the Duke of  Wellington’s battalion were shocked to hear Maj Gen Binns announce two months ago that when the regiment was cut from two to three, the Wellington’s name would disappear.

Following a mini-mutiny, it is understood that he is considering a number of ways of retaining the name of the man who defeated Napoleon.

One proposal is to name the two remaining Yorkshire Regiment battalions, the Duke of York’s and the Duke of Wellington’s.

Another is to call one of the 200-strong regimental companies the Duke of Wellington’s.

A spokeswoman for Prince Andrew said he had not met Maj Gen Binns last week, but declined to say if the two men had spoken.

The Army cuts, which will reduce its fighting strength to 82,000, its lowest level since the Napoleonic Wars, is expected to see several other famous regimental names disappear including the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, whose Royal Colonel is the Queen; the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards; 3rd Battalion, Mercian  Regiment; and 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

Savings: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is expected to claim that the cuts focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits

The cuts have been delayed for weeks amid squabbling over where they should fall.

English MPs claim that Scots regiments have been spared for fear of antagonising public opinion in Scotland ahead of the vote on  independence.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will claim that the reductions focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits, in particular regiments with a high number of Commonwealth troops.

However, critics say this does not square with his decision to exempt the Gurkhas, who previously have been championed by actress Joanna Lumley.

‘The Scots, Welsh and Gurkhas have been spared the worst for political reasons, so the English regiments are in for a nasty shock,’ said a source.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The traditions and heritage of the regimental system are hugely respected.

'The Defence Secretary has been clear that the regimental system is fundamental to British Army fighting power.

'We are not going to change that.’
