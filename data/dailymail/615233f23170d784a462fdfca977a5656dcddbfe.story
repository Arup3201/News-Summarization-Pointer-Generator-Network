Side effects: A 22-year-old man and his dog were hospitalized after taking a synthetic marijuana called 'Crazy Monkey'

Ingesting a synthetic marijuana called 'Crazy Monkey' caused both a man and his dog to experience seizures in yet another report of the drug's dangerous side effects.

According to a recent report in the journal Clinical Toxicology, a 22-year-old man in San Francisco took his 49-pound male dog to a veterinarian after the canine experienced signs of a seizure.

While the vet was examining the dog, the man said he felt unwell and sat on the floor and started to seize himself. 

By the time paramedics arrived, the man was able to state his name and 'I'm cold' before going into another seizure. 

A friend told doctors that the man had recently smoked a synthetic marijuana called 'Crazy Monkey'.

When
 he arrived at the hospital, the man became so severely agitated that he
 had to be physically restrained and was taken to an intensive care unit
 for monitoring.

The
 next day, he was still showing signs of confusion but was able to 
confirm to doctors that he smoked up to three 'pots' a day of Crazy 
Monkey, but denied knowing how his dog ingested the drug.

Dr Hallam Melville Gugelman, a medical toxicology fellow who treated the patient told CBS News that he believes the pet ate the substance.

His owner said he took the dog to the vet because his pet was not eating.

The
 owner apparently did not change his habits after the hospitalization, 
and was admitted to the emergency room three months later after 
experiencing another seizure due to Crazy Monkey.

Synthetic marijuana is a miX of plant and chemical substances that mimic the effects of THC, the main drug found in marijuana.

The
 drug goes by a variety of names such as Spice, K2, and Skunk and has a 
laundry list of negative side effects including anxiety, delusions, 
psychosis, acute kidney injury, and stroke.

Just this week, 15 people in New York City were hospitalized for ingesting synthetic marijuana
