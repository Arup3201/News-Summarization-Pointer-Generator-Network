A tragic house fire which killed six members of the same family is now being treating by detectives as murder, after police said last night they believe someone burgled the home and then started a blaze.

Sabah Usmani, 44, and sons Sohaib, 11, and Rayyan, six, and daughter Hira, 13, died last month in Harlow, Essex, with a third son, Muneeb, nine, and daughter Maheen, three, dying in hospital.

Dr Usmani's husband Abdul Shakoor, 45, was the only survivor, and police have made a fresh appeal for witnesses because ‘someone knows something’ about the incident but has failed to tell officers.

Evidence from the blaze suggests the 
likely cause was ‘malicious ignition’ - and detectives know there was a 
burglary at the house on the same evening or early morning of the fire, 
Essex Police said.

Police said that from the start of the probe, named Operation Shakespeare, detectives from the Kent 
and Essex Serious Crime Directorate had treated the incident as a 
suspicious fire.

A spokesman added: ‘A dedicated team 
of detectives and specialist police officers and staff have undertaken 
intensive inquiries - looking at all aspects of this case. They are working round the clock to establish how the fire started and who was responsible.'

Senior investigating officer Det Supt 
Rob Vinson said: ‘This is now a murder investigation. We believe that 
someone burgled the house and then caused a fire that took the lives of 
six innocent people.

'Someone knows something about this incident and for whatever reason has not come forward to tell police what they saw or know.

'Dr Shakoor has had to find the strength to cope with this terrible tragedy. No one can imagine the pain of losing your whole family in such a horrible way'

Det Supt Rob Vinson, Essex Police

'This is an 
unprecedented case in the history of Essex Police and we will do 
everything we can to solve this tragedy.

‘Dr Shakoor has had to find the 
strength to cope with this terrible tragedy. No one can imagine the pain
of losing your whole family in such a horrible way.

‘I need to find answers. I need the public to tell me what happened on that night.’

Dr Shakoor discovered the fire at his 
home and battled hard to save his family, suffering the effects of the 
dense smoke and also minor burns as he tried to get them out.

At the same time as fire crews were tackling the blaze, a Ford Focus car was alight in a parking area nearby.

'I need to find answers. I need the public to tell me what happened on that night'

Det Supt Rob Vinson, Essex Police

Det Supt Vinson said: ‘I need the 
public's help and appeal for information about people who were in the 
area and about items taken in the burglary.’

Dr Shakoor's laptop bag which 
contained a two-pin lead was originally found in a hedge along the 
footpath between St Michael's Close and Whitewaits, Harlow by two 
teenagers, then abandoned in Whitewaits by some garages.

‘Do you know how the laptop bag came to be abandoned in the hedge?’ Det Supt Vinson asked.

The family laptop, a Toshiba 
Satellite, is missing. The officer added: ‘Have you been offered a 
laptop such as this since October 15?’

Tragedy: Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on brickwork, and the walls are black with smoke

He asked anyone who was in the Barn Mead area on the early morning of the fire to contact police.

‘We need to find a group of four young
men, 16-19, possibly wearing tracksuits and baseball hats, one 
significantly taller than the others. Additionally we need to speak to 
two teenagers on bikes.

‘Anyone who was in the area at the time of the fire or has any information about who was there must contact us.’

Det Supt Vinson added: ‘The car that 
was discovered alight on the same morning belonged to a neighbour and 
was parked around 20 metres away from the Shakoor home. Do you have any 
information about this car fire?’
