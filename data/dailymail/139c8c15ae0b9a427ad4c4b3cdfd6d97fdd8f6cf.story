An elderly Michigan woman has confessed to smothering her infant son in 1961 and may also be responsible for the deaths of her twin daughters in 1969 and 1970, her surviving children say.

Janice Summerfield, 77, recently admitted at her Kalamazoo retirement home that 8-month-old William Earl Summerfield died at her hands and not of accidental asphyxiation as his death certificate reads, says her daughter Paula Gastian, 54.

Along with her brother Phil, who found William dead in his bed at age 4 and was blamed for the death, Gastian firmly believes her mother also murdered her twin sisters Brenda and Beth while they were still babies.

'I asked if she had told anyone and she said she told my dad,' Gastian told the Battle Creek Enquirer. 'He just told her, "Well I haven't been there for you and I guess life goes on."'

Gastian said she went to her mother to discuss the deaths of her twin sisters after her father was put in prison in September for sexually assaulting a friend's child.

When her mother said she was willing to talk, Gastian assumed she'd finally get to hear about the double murder--or at the very least, willful neglect--of her baby sisters.

Instead, she got a surprise confession--her mother said she'd killed her baby daughter Beth in 1969 and then her twin sister Brenda just months later in 1970.

Gastian says she was blamed for Brenda's death. 

'She was quiet and then she said his name,' Gastian told the Enquirer about the day her mother confessed. 'I don't know how I stayed calm.' 

After an initial denial, Summerfield told the Battle Creek Enquirer that she had, in fact, killed William all those years ago.

'I didn't know what I was doing,' she said. 'All these years I had forgotten. I am going to die. I hate myself so much. I am ready to die.'

Getting closure? Baby William Summerfield's cause of death on his 1961 death certificate was 'aspiration of regurgitated formula'

Embattled: Phil Summerfield says his mother blamed him when his baby brother died and he's lived with the trauma, and that of being raised in a violent and alcoholic home, all his life

The tiny box containing the body of William Earl Summerfield has been exhumed. It remained unclear, pending the results of an autopsy, whether or not Summerfield would be charged. 

No investigation had begun in the death of either twin. 

His mother's confession was especially bittersweet for Phil Summerfield, who was blamed for William's death at such a young age.

'After she allegedly smothered the baby she put the baby in bed with me,' said the 58-year-old, who's been in and out of therapy his whole life, branded as bipolar and even once suffered through a suicide attempt. 'I was shy of 5 years old. I woke and he was dead. I picked him up and took him downstairs. She told me it was my fault.'

Both Phil and Paula recall their home being a violent one, where children were routinely beaten or even tossed down stairs. 

All of Janice Summerfield's surviving children, even including younger Michael--who has no memory of the events and was raised in a far less tempestuous environment after the parents 'turned to religion'--believe the twins died as a result of their mother's actions or inactions.

'My older brother and I have lived through hell,' Gastian said. 'Now to know so many things will be exposed, it is a relief for my siblings who are gone but in my heart have never ever, been forgotten.'

Getting answers: Paula asked her mother about the death of her siblings--thinking she'd get a response about her mother's role in the twins' deaths--after her father William Summerfield was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting a friend's child
