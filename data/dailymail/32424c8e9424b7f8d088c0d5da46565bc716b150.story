Cancer has played an enormous role in Lachlan Korvin's life 

Lachlan Korvin was only 10 years old when he lost his mother Tracey to brain cancer in 2003. 

But before he could properly come to terms with the loss, he was dealt with another blow -receiving his own testicular cancer diagnosis the following year.

Since then, the 24-year-old's whole life has been dedicated to helping people cope with the trauma that comes with either being diagnosed with the illness or having a loved one struggle through it.

Aside from working as a radiographer at Dandenong Hospital in Victoria, Mr Korvin is part of the team who on Friday will launch the world's first support website for the 23,000 young Australians who are affected by the illness in some way each year.

'I had some idea of what was going on at the time, but it was never really a sit down sort of thing,' Mr Korvin said of his mother, who he described as 'warm, funny and a bit organic'.

'She was diagnosed and after the initial treatment she went into remission and then she relapsed, which is what took her. That was really scary - when it came back, and then it obviously just got worse.

'When I was diagnosed, that was a bit harder because I'd had that experience and knew what could happen.'

Back in 2005, during the completion of his own treatment, Mr Korvin said there were very few avenues for a young person to seek support when cancer struck in their lives.

'I was diagnosed while in high school and I had a cool group of friends who helped me through the journey, so there was some understanding and I was very lucky in that sense as not a lot of people had that,' he said.

'But your friends can only go so far when you need people who have been there and done that.

'There's always a lot of uncertainty as to what's going to happen and you have so many questions running through your head, especially during the early stages of diagnosis.

'Things like: will the treatment affect my fertility? Am I actually going to survive? Will I be physically scared? Is the family ever going to be the same again? And then depending on your age you might think: I am too young for this to happen and what role am I going to have to play now, do I have to step up?

Mr Korvin (left, with his brother) was then diagnosed with testicular cancer. During his remission he learnt of cancer support group CanTeen and has since remained an active member

'That is what gets people - this bombardment of despair.'

This uncertainty and the lack of support is what inspired Mr Korvin and the CanTeen team to design a website where fears could be expressed and advice and support sought at any time of the day or night.

Mr Korvin  learnt of CanTeen through the hospital grapevine following his remission and after getting involved, became an incredibly active member, eventually making his way up to the support group's board.

'I joined up in late 2005 when there was a heavy focus on peer support through in the program and then after a few years I thought I should take on a bigger role because it has done so much for me,' Mr Korvin said.

He is now heavily involved in the launch of the CanTeen Online Support Platform, the world's first website that provides young people with 7-day access to counsellors and 24/7 access to an online community where they can share their experiences through forums and testimonials.

'CanTeen research shows that young people dealing with cancer are five to six times more likely to develop mental health issues like anxiety and depression,' CanTeen's CEO, Peter Orchard , said.

'Having instant peer and professional support available seven days a week – from anywhere in Australia - will combat the main triggers of psychological distress, which include feelings of isolation and a lack of information about what their cancer journey will involve.

'Our specially trained counsellors truly understand the physical, emotional and practical impact of living with cancer and will be available over extended hours via instant messaging, email or phone.

Designed by young people who have all had cancer touch their lives, the website which has received $2 million in government funding, will be launched on Friday.
