Clues: Human remains have been found where Iraq War veteran Noah Pippin disappeared two years ago

Human remains have been found in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in northwest Montana, where a team has been searching for an Iraq war veteran who disappeared two years ago, a sheriff said Friday.

About
a month before he was last seen, Noah Pippin quit his job with the Los 
Angeles Police Department where he worked after serving with the Marines in Iraq.

He later went to visit his family in Michigan
and told them he was heading back west to serve with the California 
National Guard. Instead, he drove a rental car to Montana.

Hikers reported seeing Pippin heading into the wilderness ill-prepared for a long stay in the wild and apparently on-edge.

He was never seen again.

The parents of Noah Pippin released a statement Friday saying Lewis and Clark County sheriff's and coroner's officials told them remains had been found in the Burnt Creek area.

Authorities haven't confirmed the identity of the remains yet, but Mike and Rosalie Pippin said there is a strong likelihood they belong to their son.

'Noah's remains are almost 98% positively identified as having been found. Thank you to all you sweet and wonderful people who have held us up in prayer and expressed your caring over the last 2 years,' the family wrote on a Facebook page for their missing son.

A search party of border agents, search and rescue officials, a sheriff's deputy and volunteers found the remains and planned to bring them back to the state crime lab in Missoula. Coroner M.E. 'Mickey' Nelson said it could be several days or even weeks before the body can be positively identified.

'There was enough circumstantial evidence that I felt comfortable, and I informed the family, that their loved one has been located, based on preliminary indicators and circumstantial things we found,' Nelson said. He declined to elaborate on what was found.

Missing: Noah Pippin, described as a giant but polite man with a shaved head, was last seen on September 15 of 2010 by hikers

Nelson said animals appeared to have gotten to the body, but there was no indication yet of how the person died or when. He said nothing so far suggests it is a criminal case.

Noah Pippin, described as a giant but
polite man with a shaved head, was last seen Sept. 15, 2010, near the 
Chinese Wall, which is a ridge along the Continental Divide that is part
of the Bob Marshall Wilderness south of Glacier National Park.

'It's about as primitive, outside of Alaska, as you can get in the United States,' Nelson said.

People
who saw Noah Pippin on a trail before he disappeared said the former 
Marine appeared ill-prepared for an extended stay in the wilderness.

About
a month before he was last seen, Noah Pippin quit his job with the Los 
Angeles Police Department.

He later went to visit his family in Michigan
and told them he was heading back west to serve with the California 
National Guard. Instead, he drove a rental car to Montana.

The
relatively short spring and summer in the higher elevations of 
northwest Montana had hampered other searches for Pippin. Nelson said 
the family reacted about as he expected to the news of remains being 
found.

'It's a tough situation in the sense that there's some joy but of course a long time of sorrow, the sorrow being they haven't seen him in so long,' he said. 'The joy that we've found him doesn't overcome the grief.'
