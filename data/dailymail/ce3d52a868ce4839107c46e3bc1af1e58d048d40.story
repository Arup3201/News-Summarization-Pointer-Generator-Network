Sarah Donaghey’s dreams of motherhood were shattered when she was told the only cure for her cervical cancer was a hysterectomy.

However, the 27-year-old now has a chance of having a baby because her mother, 49-year-old Linda Donaghey, has offered to be a surrogate.

Ms Donaghey, a sales administrator from Leeds, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of the cancer when she was just 25

She was devastated when she was told that the only way to save her life would be to remove her womb.

However, she was given a glimmer of hope as surgeons were able to save her ovaries which tests last February revealed were still producing eggs.

Within months of her hysterectomy, Ms Donaghey and her partner, Stuart Simpson, 26, started to research surrogacy.

Ms Donaghey told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Our biggest worry was that even if the surrogate is pregnant with a baby that is biologically ours, legally she is the mum. We worried she wouldn’t be able to give up our baby.’

She explained how she was discussing the problem with her mother, when the grandmother-of-three said that she would act as a surrogate.

She
 told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I didn’t have to think twice about it. I found
 it heart breaking that she’d had to go through such a terrible ordeal 
at such a young age.

The family's local authority will not pay for their IVF treatment because Ms Donaghey's partner, Stuart Simpson, already has a daughter, Lola (pictured). Ms Donaghey has always dreamed of having a large family of her own

She added: ‘Some friends think I am mad but I didn’t have to think twice about offering to have a baby for Sarah. I just see it as some early babysitting.’

However, the family has now hit another setback as their local authority has informed them that they will not pay for the IVF treatment required to allow Linda to carry Sarah and Stuart’s child, because Mr Simpson already has a daughter, Lola, from a previous relationship.

As a result, they now face a race against time to raise the £7,000 needed before Mrs Donaghey reaches her 50th birthday, after which doctors will be reluctant to allow her to be a surrogate.
