Getting children to welcome a new baby into the home can sometimes prove difficult - especially when it wasn't the playmate they were hoping for.

Indeed, one mother from Colorado filmed the moment she told her daughter she was expecting a boy.

Footage shows the toddler's smile quickly turning to a frown and then a cry 'no' as she breaks down in tears.

'I want a baby sister!' the little girl dramatically sobs. 

Her mother calmly explains that it isn't possible and she'll be getting a baby brother.

'That's why it's blue,' she says referencing a baby shower cupcake at home.

But the girl remains vehemently opposed to the idea.

The clip ends with her exclaiming: 'I want a baby sister right now!' 

Hopefully she eventually came around to the idea of having a little brother.
