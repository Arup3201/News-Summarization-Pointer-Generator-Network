Bayern Munich supporters took a swipe at the Premier League and the new £5bn TV rights deal during their win against Hamburg. 

The fans held aloft a banner which said: 'This ain't no Premier League - No to the English model'. 

Bundesliga clubs are set to receive £617 million for the 2016-2017 season when the current four-year deal expires.

Accrington Stanley tweeted that one one game the new deal would cover their wage bill for 20 years and Bayern had a similar message for the Premier League.

The 5.136 billion agreement for the sale of the rights for the 2016-19 season was a significant increase on the current arrangement.

Sky Sports recently won five out of the seven TV packages in the new Premier League TV rights deal and paid over £4bn for the privilege to do so.

Bayern Munich soared to an 8-0 victory, after unfurling the banner, against Hamburg and showcased the abundance of attacking talent the Bundesliga has to offer.
