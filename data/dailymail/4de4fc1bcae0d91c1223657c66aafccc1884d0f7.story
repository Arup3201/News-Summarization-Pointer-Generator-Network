The director of a video which showed a young woman being catcalled more than 100 times as she walked through the streets of Manhattan for ten hours has come under fire for the seeming racial bias of his film. 

Director Rob Bliss filmed actress Shoshana Roberts, 24, as she walked through busy, New York City streets, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, while enduring a barrage of comments like: 'What's up, Beautiful?'; 'Smile!' and 'God bless you, Mami...'. At one point, a man walks in step with her, silently, for five minutes.

The majority of men featured in the two-minute clip are black and Latino, a fact which Mr Bliss addressed on Thursday during a Q&A session on Reddit after the video garnered reams of media coverage.

Unwanted attention: Shoshana Roberts, 24, who appeared in the video showing the cat-calling she experienced over a ten-hour period, has since been subject to rape threats online

One Reddit user, Murphyslol, remarked that almost all of the men on the video were black and asked the director if any white or Asian men harassed Shoshana. 

Mr Bliss responded: 'Honestly we did have a lot of white dudes in this video, but for whatever reason it worked out that they would be the ones to say something just in passing, or from a distance off camera. This made their screen time fairly short by comparison, but the numbers were relatively similar.

'As the video says at the end, it was upwards of 100+ harassments, so obviously not everything was shown, otherwise we'd have a video that's too long for internet attention spans. But really it was across the board, just about everyone said/did something while we filmed.'

The response to the director's remark drew heated responses. 

Dr Welsana Asrat, a psychiatrist in Harlem, tweeted: 'Rob Bliss' biased catcalling video serves to support his ongoing gentrification campaign.' 

Adam wrote: 'Rob Bliss intentionally edited out the white men from that video to demonize PoC. He's a professional gentrification proponent. It's his MO.'

Automnia tweeted: 'So this white guy, Rob Bliss, records a woman getting street harassment from loads of men, then cuts out most of the s*** from white guys.'

He also added: 'Basically Rob Bliss is a rich white guy with a vested interest in portraying poor black men as the sole perpetrators of street harassment.'

MailOnline spoke to Mr Bliss on Thursday who defended his video, saying that his artistic decision to cap filming at ten hours 'showed something that was realistic but statistically inaccurate'.

He said that although a number of white men were cut during the editing process - so were men of other races.

The director said that the number of white men in the video - roughly six - is representative of New York demographics, according to figures he quoted from Wikipedia.  

Mr Bliss said: 'The 18 scenes that we show is a very small portion of street harassment that goes on, because it is a small size.

'We got 108 reactions but after editing down, the two longest incidents [involving a black man and a Latino man] make up half the video.' 

He added: 'If we filmed for a much longer time, it would show the breakdown of New York City and a much wider demographic.'

The director also pointed to the fact that there were no Asian men in the video - not to suggest that they didn't harass women but 'that's what's going to happen in a short-time span'. 

Mr Bliss said he did understand why people would be angry at the perceived racial skew but added: 'On this ten hour pass through, this was what we got. It wasn't accurate.'

Hollaback!, the organization which teamed with Mr Bliss to promote the video, released a statement following the director's comments on the racial skew today.

In part, it read: 'First, we regret the unintended racial bias in the editing of the video that over represents men of color. Although we appreciate Rob’s support, we are committed to showing the complete picture. It is our hope and intention that this video will be the start of a series to demonstrate that the type of harassment we’re concerned about is directed toward women of all races and ethnicities and conducted by an equally diverse population of men.' 

Miss Roberts was subject to 108 instances of catcalling during the filming of the video. In the two-minute clip, the majority of cat-callers are black and Latino - this individual is one of the white men included

The video struck a chord this week and instantly became a viral sensation. Since it was published on Tuesday, it has been viewed more than 17million times on YouTube. 

The video was covered by bloggers and major news networks alike, leading to another disturbing consequence.

Miss Roberts, who is the subject of the film, has had multiple rape threats directed towards her. 

Speaking about the experience of making the video, the 24-year-old told The Post : 'I felt like crying and I have occurrences in my past of sexual assault, so I wasn’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me. 

'I was just going over in my head and reliving, unfortunately, these memories while I was walking. I wanted to break down in tears.' 

Emily May, executive director of Hollaback!, the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video, told The Washington Post: 'We’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against Shoshana and we’re pulling those down as quickly as possible, but they exist.  

'That’s scary and I think what they’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this. And both of us are saying no, we need to talk about this because if we don’t talk about this, if we don’t get this story out, then none of this is going to change.' 

At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them. That didn't stop the comments from coming. 

When she didn't respond, one man told her: 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more!' 

Miss Roberts said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her.

'The frequency is something alarming,' she added.
