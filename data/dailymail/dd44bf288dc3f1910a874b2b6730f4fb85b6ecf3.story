A shocking arsenal of guns and rounds of ammunition, all legally bought by the mother of the Sandy Hook school shooter, were documented in newly released police files.

Photographs of the home 20-year-old Adam Lanza shared with his mother, Nancy, showed multiple rounds of ammunition, gun magazines, shot paper targets, gun cases and a safe with a rifle in it.

Investigators also found a check Mrs Lanza had written out for her son to buy another gun, and an empty pack of earplugs. The shooter had been wearing a set when he began his rampage.

The final police report on the Sandy Hook school shooting revealed a photograph of an unknown boy as a baby dressed in camouflage gear and gnawing on a gun

The release of the documents provides more detail on how the shooting unfolded and the lengths teachers went to as they tried to protect the young children.

They were made public by Newtown police on Friday in a move that marks the end of the investigation into the December 14 attack that killed 20 first-grade students and six school staff.

After shooting his mother in the head four times as she laid in her bed, Lanza shot his way into the school.

During the attack, which lasted for just over ten minutes, 154 spent .223 casings were recovered from the scene, according to the state's attorney.

Police photos of the inside of the school shows walls pocked with bullet marks, and shattered windows where bullet holes can be seen next to children's drawings that were on display.

As police entered the building, Lanza turned a handgun on himself in one of the school's classrooms.

He had been armed with 10 30-round magazines for his semiautomatic Bushmaster .223 caliber model XM15 rifle and bullets for his two handguns and a shotgun.

When police searched his home they found a further 1,600 rounds of unspent ammunition.

Lanza and his mother had both enjoyed 
shooting. Although in the weeks leading up to the shooting it was claimed that they had communicated only by email despite living together, 
the pair liked going to target practice.

Handwritten
 notes listing the addresses of local gunshops, NRA shooting 
certificates for Mrs Lanza and a Christmas check written out to her son 
so he could buy another gun were all found at their property.

A
 photo of a child was also found. In it the boy is 
gnawing at a revolver and has rounds of ammunition laid across his lap.

Also
 among the evidence, was a birthday card that Lanza had received from 
his father Peter Lanza where he offered to take him shooting.

The brightly-colored card reads: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad.'

A book released last month 
'Newtown: An American Tragedy’, reveals that family friend Marvin 
LaFontaine used to invite Nancy, Adam and his brother Ryan, now 24, over
 for shooting sessions with himself and his own son Jordan.

They
 would go to a makeshift gun range on his property where they would 
shoot an lightweight aluminium Ruger 10/22 at paper bullseyes and other 
targets.

According to Mr LaFontaine Adam was ‘comfortable with a firearm’ - at the age of just four years old.

The book reads: ‘The Ruger was lightweight and easy to handle and, in Nancy’s opinion, the ideal weapon for her young child.

‘Adam’s
 tiny face would tense up as he concentrated while his mother would 
patiently go over, step by step, the proper hold and technique for the 
firearm.’

Marvin explains: ‘From the beginning you could tell that Adam liked the feel of the gun in his hands’.

For Mrs Lanza, guns were a hobby. 'She told me she liked the single-mindedness of shooting,' Dan Holmes, who got to know Mrs Lanza while doing landscaping work for her, told The Washington Post earlier this year.

Russell Ford, another of Mrs Lanza’s friends, added: ‘She came from a culture of guns. That’s how she was raised in New Hampshire. "Live free or die", that was the kind of woman Nancy Lanza was’.

Prosecutors
 issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed Lanza 
as obsessed with mass murders, but the report concluded that Lanza's 
motives for the massacre might never be known.

Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a 
fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive
 or threatening tendencies,' it said.
