An independent medical examiner testified on Thursday that a black teenage girl's hands were swollen from pounding on the door of a white suburban Detroit man's home, which could support the man's claim that he thought the teenager was trying to break in.

The testimony came during the trial of Theodore Wafer, 55, who told Dearborn Heights police that he was in fear for his life when his shotgun went off accidentally, blasting through his screen door and killing 19-year-old Renisha McBride on his front porch in November.

Wafer is charged with second-degree murder in the racially-charged case and faces up to life in prison if convicted.

Renisha McBride, 19, was killed in November after she was shot on the porch of a white suburban Detroit man's home. A medical examiner said on Thursday she was pounding the door, which could support the defendant's claim

Dr. Werner Spitz, a veteran forensic pathologist testifying for the defense, said that photos from the crime scene indicated swelling of McBride's hands.

'A blunt impact to the hands causes swelling,' said Spitz, who did not conduct McBride's autopsy but reviewed case reports.

Dr Spitz sparred with a prosecutor on Thursday over a wound on the hand of Miss McBride.

On cross-examination, prosecutor Athina Siringas noted that Miss McBride was in a car wreck three-and-a-half hours before arriving at Wafer's porch. 

She asked Dr Spitz if the victim could have injured her hand in the crash and pressed him to give a scientific reason for his opinion.

'It may not always sound scientific... I'm told somebody at 4:30 in the morning pounded at (Wafer's) door in various places - on the window, on the door, on another door around the house,' Spitz said.

'And that same person now has a superficial laceration on the hand, a runoff of fresh blood, which means it probably just happened.'

He said photos show McBride's hands were swollen, one more than the other.

'There's no way of associating these findings with anything but the event that led to the death,' Spitz testified, referring to the pounding.

Dr Kilak Kesha, the Wayne County medical examiner who conducted McBride's autopsy, had testified on Wednesday that he believed there had been no need to examine the teenager's hands.

The killing of McBride, who had been unarmed, has sparked protests in Dearborn Heights and comparisons to the 2012 shooting death of black unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. 

Wafer's attorneys haven't said if he will testify, but legal experts believe he must if he wants to show jurors that he reasonably acted out of fear. 

The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday.

The trial will resume on Monday, August 4.
