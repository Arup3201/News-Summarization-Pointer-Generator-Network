Britain may have a new species of bat.

Geoffroy’s bat was first seen in the UK last year but a second sighting has raised hopes that the tiny mammal has set up home here.

A solitary male, usually found in continental Europe, was spotted at a nature reserve near Bath.

DNA in its droppings will be analysed to confirm the discovery.

Jim Mullholland, of Avon Bat Group, said the creature was too far inland for it to be a vagrant. ‘Given the sedentary nature of the species, which typically only travels up to 25 miles between its breeding area and hibernation site, this find provides bat experts with hope that Geoffroy’s bat is now resident within the UK.'

Named after French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the bat was first seen in West Sussex last September.

The species (Myotis emarginatus) is generally found across the Mediterranean, Belgium, and southern parts of the Netherlands, Germany and Poland, as well as northwest Africa and the west side of Asia Minor.

Brown's Folly is well-known for bats with 13 of the 17 UK bat species recorded there including the greater horseshoe and Bechstein's.

A key distinguishing feature of the Geoffroy's bat, which is named after the French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, is the notch on its ear.

The 100-acre Brown's Folly reserve, where the bat was found, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, has wildflower-rich grasslands and ancient woodlands.
