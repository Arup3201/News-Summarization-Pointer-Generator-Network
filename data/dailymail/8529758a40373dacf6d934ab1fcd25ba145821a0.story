A Russian intelligence-gathering ship accompanied by a tugboat has been roaming the waters off the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the past month, the Pentagon revealed Thursday.

Agency spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Crosson said the Russian vessels Viktor Leonov and Nikolay Chiker have been operating beyond American territorial seas near the coast of Cuba.

'We respect the freedom of all nations, as reflected in international law, to operate military vessels beyond the territorial seas of other nations,' the official stated. 

Eavesdropping: The Pentagon says the intelligence-gathering ship Viktor Leonov has been operating in international waters off the East Coast for the past month

Strategic location: The Vishnya-class spy boat may have been targeting the U.S. nuclear missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia,

The Viktor Leonov CCB-175 boat, which measures 300 feet long and 47.5 feet wide, was first sighted in Cuba back in February, when it docked in Havana.

The Russian Vishnya-class vessel with a crew of 200 sailors carries high-tech electronic surveillance equipment and weaponry, AK-630 rapid-fire cannons and surface-to-air missiles.

At the time, neither Cuba nor Russia acknowledged or explained the presence of the spy ship in Havana.

According to media reports, the Leonov made additional trips to the island nation 30 miles from Florida in March and earlier this month.

Officials with the U.S. Department of Defense suspect that since March, the Leonov and the Chiker have been part of an intelligence-gathering operation targeting the U.S. nuclear missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia, as well as other key military installations on the East Coast, The Washington Free Beacon reported.

The pair of Russian vessels also have been detected in the vicinity of the U.S. Naval Station in Mayport, Florida.

According to a recent article in the Russian-language Armenian news outlet Iratvakan.com, the ocean-going tug Nikolay Chiker was also sighted earlier this month near the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.

The sightings coincided with a large-scale Russian nuclear exercise involving 10,000 troops and 1,000 pieces of equipment, which took place between April 17 and April 19.

The appearance of the Leonov and the Chiker in such close proximity to American shores comes at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Russia are extremely high due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
