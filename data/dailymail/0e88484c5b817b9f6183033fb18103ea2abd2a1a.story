David De Gea could face at least a month out of action after dislocating a finger during training with the Spanish national side.

The Manchester United goalkeeper was having the injury assessed by Spain's team doctor on Friday night before deciding when he should return to Old Trafford.

The 24-year-old who has been in brilliant form for United this season was trying to save a low shot from Paco Alcacer when the little finger on his right hand jammed during a session preparing for Saturday's friendly against Belarus in Huelva.

He was immediately led away, and United confirmed that the Spanish FA had told them the injury was a dislocation.

It is another injury worry for Spain, who are already without Chelsea midfield Cesc Fabregas because of a hamstring problem. 

'The keeper David de Gea was forced to stop training after suffering an injury to the fifth finger of his right hand,' read a statement on sefutbol, the national team's official website.

'Having suffered a similar situation in the past, De Gea will remain with the squad and will wait to see how he improves.'

The injury will come as a blow to De Gea, who had been hoping to push on after usurping Iker Casillas as Spain's No 1 goalkeeper last month. 

It's also massive blow for manager Louis van Gaal who already has an injury crisis among his defenders and could now lose his No 1 keeper for several weeks.

He has started all 11 Premier League games so far for the Dutchman, keeping three clean sheets in the process. 

Van Gaal has a week to decide whether to go with reserve stopper Anders Lindegaard, who was told earlier this season he can leave Old Trafford, or offer a first-team opportunity to inexperienced Ben Amos, who has played for England Under 21s.

Former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes has also been training with the Red Devils as he completes his recovery from a knee injury.

United already have a series of injury doubts, with as many as nine first-team players - including Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo - currently sidelined ahead of their next fixture at Arsenal on November 22.
