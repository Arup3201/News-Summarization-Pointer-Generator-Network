Plans to end criminal punishment for not paying the TV licence could cost the BBC £200million a year and lead to channels being axed, an executive said yesterday.

Strategy chief James Purnell warned that viewers must be threatened with jail or they would simply stop paying the £145.50 annual charge.

He was hitting back at Government plans to make evading the licence a civil matter, which means offenders would also avoid getting a criminal record.

CBeebies, BBC Four and CBBC could all face the axe if plans to decriminalise TV licence evasion go ahead, the Corporation has warned

Removing the threat of jail means 
fines for not paying the fee – currently set at a maximum of £1,000 – 
would be raised even higher, said Mr Purnell, a former Labour Culture 
Secretary.

In 2012, more 
than 180,000 people, or around 3,500 a week, faced  the courts for not 
paying their licence fee, accounting for one in nine cases before 
magistrates.

From January 
2011 to March 2013, some 107 people were sent to jail, the ultimate 
punishment for not paying the fine imposed for evading the licence.

But the heavy-handed tactics of the BBC’s army of collectors have sparked growing anger among viewers.

The
 corporation was also criticised for turning its viewers into criminals 
by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, He has tabled an amendment to change the law 
which has the backing of 100-plus MPs.

CBBC, which airs shows like Dick and Dom Go Wild, has a budget of almost £80million

‘It
 is diabolical that those who can’t afford to pay the licence fee are 
being turned into criminals,’ he said. ‘These cases are clogging up the 
criminal justice system.

‘Imagine if President Putin started charging a poll tax to fund a Russian state broadcaster and locked up people for not paying.

‘There
 would be an outcry. There is a growing feeling within Parliament that 
things have to stop. This issue is not going to go away.’

BBC executive James Purnell said if licence fee evasion rose to 5 per cent, it would cost the BBC £200million

Last
 week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed proposals to make 
non-payment a civil matter, as with gas and electricity bills, and Sky 
subscriptions.

But Mr 
Purnell, speaking at the launch of the new BBC iPlayer, argued: ‘Say the
 rate of evasion was to double from about five per cent now, that would 
be £200million, that would be the equivalent of all of BBC4, all of 
CBeebies, all of CBBC.

‘Doing
 it very quickly would be a huge risk. The choice would mean either we 
take some services off [air] or the Government would have to have a 
higher licence fee.’

He denied that the court system was being clogged up as licence fee cases were looked at ‘in bulk’.

Mr Purnell claimed that under a civil punishment, magistrates would not be able to match the fine to the non-payer’s income.

‘So
 there is actually a danger we go over to a system in which we have 
higher fines but with less success in collecting the licence fee,’ added
 the BBC boss.

Mr Purnell 
also dismissed the idea of a subscription system, saying it would cost 
roughly £500million to set up for 40million Freeview sets and cost more 
than the licence fee system to run.

Last month, director general Tony 
Hall said the BBC wanted to extend the licence fee to the iPlayer, 
meaning those who only watch catch-up TV online will have to pay just 
like viewers who own television sets.

Comedian Frankie Boyle has been given a new show on the BBC’s iPlayer website – putting him out of the reach  of watchdogs.

The Scottish performer, 41, has a long history of offending viewers but Ofcom will be powerless as it only has power to act over complaints about terrestrial TV.

He will appear in Frankie Boyle and Bob Mortimer’s Cookery Show in May in which the two comedians satirise the popularity of TV cooking programmes.

Boyle was fired by Channel 4 in 2012 for making sick jokes about competitors in the Paralympics.

His show is the latest in the BBC trend towards showing more content solely online where there is no watershed.

This was criticised by Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, who warned it would expose children to more adult material. The BBC said editorial rules will keep Boyle in line.
