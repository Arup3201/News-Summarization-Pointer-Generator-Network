An Oklahoma police department's newest recruit is a total dummy - a repurposed CPR dummy, that is.

Nicknamed the 'Plastic Popo,' the smooth-faced new cop makes a convincing foil when dressed in a blue police uniform and propped up in the front seat of a police car.

He's the newest weapon in the cash-strapped Ada police department's battle against speeding.

Desk duty: Plastic Popo takes a break from his regular job of slowing down speeding drivers

Effective: The Ada force can't afford to have an officer in every spot where speeding drivers are reported, but Plastic Popo works for free

'We can't keep people in every neighborhood that they complain about speeders,' Ada Police Chief Mike Miller told News 9.

'But we can put that car there and let it sit all day and it will slow people down.'

He's quickly become the Ada PD's most popular cop, with a dedicated Facebook page where people who have tracked him down post selfies with the unflappable fuzz.

His popularity hasn't gotten in the way of his effectiveness though - if anything, it's increased it.

After setting the Plastic Popo up in a car on a road, says one Ada motorist, next, 'they'll put a real cop in it, and they'll pull you over. They get everybody.'

Sacrifice: Plastic Popo was injured after a drunk driver crashed into his patrol car as he waited on the shoulder of a road

Famous: A Facebook page dedicated to Plastic Popo selfies instructs fans not 'to do anything that will make the real Popos upset with you'

Despite his relatively risk-free role as a traffic officer, Plastic Popo has seen his fair share of action in the line of duty.

The dummy was in position sitting in the front seat of a police car when a drunk driver hit the vehicle head-on.

'He was 10 or 12 feet off the shoulder and a drunk driver came along and took out the car,' said Chief Miller.

Being the strong, silent type, Plastic Popo never complained, despite being towed away in his damaged police vehicle.

His colleagues put a bandaid over his cheek and as soon as there's another free patrol vehicle, Plastic Popo will be back out on he roads.
