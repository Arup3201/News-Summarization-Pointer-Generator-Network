Whether they are hunters or the hunted, these cunning animals are all masters of 
disguise who can fool even the most beady-eyed passer by into believing
 they are not there.

Some hide under lily pads, some dissolve into the bark of a tree while others slip seamlessly into the snow, either to hide from a hungry predator or silently stalk an unwitting prey.

But the one thing from which they cannot hide is the all-seeing camera lens of photographer Art Wolfe.

He has spent over 35 years roaming the deserts of Africa, the rainforests of South America, the mountains of the United States and snow plains of Canada to capture wildlife at its most invisible.

He has travelled through every 
continent in the world in tireless pursuit of more subjects for his chef-d'oeuvre 'Vanishing Act' that dates back to the 1980s.

Art said: 'Throughout my career as a nature photographer, I have challenged myself to present new perspectives on well-documented subjects.

'Like most of my projects this collection has been a long time in the making.

'Finding and filming animals on location is an exhilarating and painstaking process. I'm still adding to the project even now.

'Conventional wildlife photography calls for isolating the subject by selective focus, this way the animal is clearly defined.

Can't see the wolf from the trees: A wolf peering out from behind a tree trunk in an autumn Montana forest

Eye spy: A spectacled caiman in Llanos, Venezuela. Wolfe works to make it visually challenging to the viewer by using depth of field, scale and placement and confusing the subject

Leaf me alone: A Mealy or Blue-crowned parrot disappears like just another leaf in the lush Central American rainforest, Chan Chich, Belize

'Photographers always want to show off their subject. And yet, is this really the way an animal is viewed by the human eye? Not quite.

'We don't have the isolating abilities that a telephoto lens provides. On most occasions an animal remains somewhat concealed by the clutter of its natural habitat-a necessity of survival for both predator and prey.

'I have basically employed three different photographic approaches and purposely worked to enhance the difficulty to find the camouflaged subject-as difficult as it is in the wild to see animals that do not want to be seen.

Snake eyes: A horned adder matches the colour of the sand in the Namib Desert, Namibia, where they bury themselves using a swimming motion to disappear beneath the hot surface

Rock and hole: A gyrfalcon at their nest built on a cliff, left, and a California Ground Squirrel blends in with its rocky environment, right

Bark and hide: A Great Gray Owl positions itself in front of a similar pattern to take advantage of his camouflage in Oregon, United States

'Since it is impossible to capture all the distractions to the senses of an entire landscape in a photo, I worked to make it visually challenging by using depth of field, scale and placement and confusing the subject.'

Art is also a successful book publisher and television producer. He has published at least one book a year since 1989.

The 61-year-old from Seattle said: 'It is in the wild places, where the edge of the earth meets the corners of the sky, the human spirit is fed.'
