'Leicester took a risk with me at the start when they brought me here without a lot of experience and they stuck with me, so now I'm doing the same thing with them.'

De Laet joined the Foxes in May 2012 from Manchester United following a series of extended loan spells.

He made two appearances for his country in the Kirin Cup in Japan in 2009.
