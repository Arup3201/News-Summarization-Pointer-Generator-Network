Taxpayers, MPs and councillors united last night to condemn the decision to spend £10,000 on flying lessons for a failed asylum-seeker.

They said the decision was ‘plain wrong’ and ‘crazy’ when public services are being cut.

The controversy centres on Yonas Admasu Kebede, 21, who is training to be a pilot despite a ruling that he must leave Britain next year.

Newcastle Council has to pay for his lessons after the Court of Appeal ruled it had a duty to meet his ‘education costs’ as he has no parents and had been taken into its care.

Yesterday, it emerged that the authority has already spent £30,000 on the case and will also have to pay Mr Kebede’s costs.

Councillors could now take the decision to the Supreme Court, which would incur further costs.

Labour MP John Woodcock said: ‘This crazy ruling could signal open season for a run of indefensible claims.

'Flying lessons for someone ordered to leave the country is just plain wrong.’

Conservative MP Peter Bone added: ‘My constituents struggle to get by each day, Most people would find it an extraordinary waste of money.’

Local councillors also questioned why the money is being spent after Newcastle’s revenue was cut by £9million last year.

Henry Gallagher said: ‘Flying lessons seems fairly extreme. The main city swimming pool has closed and there are libraries under threat.’

Fellow councillor Marc Donnelly said: ‘In times of limited public funds, we have to be extremely careful.’

There was also anger on Twitter last night from across the country. Dan Forrest, of Middlesbrough, wrote: ‘Pensioners will die this winter ’cos of fuel costs.

'But never mind, we’re paying for an asylum seeker’s flying lessons!’

Graham McNeill, of Surrey, wrote: 'The mind boggles more and more every day . . .’

Edward Cyster, of London, wrote: ‘I wish I would have been this lucky!’

Mr Kebede’s lawyer Paul Heron said yesterday that he could not access ‘student support in the normal way’.

He was ‘confident’ the student will gain indefinite leave to stay in the UK and be able to repay the money by getting a job.

Mr Kebede has taken the first four out of 45 lessons costing £165-an-hour at Elstree Aerodrome, Hertfordshire,

With his brother Abiy, 20, he arrived from Ethiopia in 2004 with their older brother and father, who later abandoned them.

Their asylum bid failed but they have discretionary leave to remain until November 2014.

The council is also paying for Abiy to attend university.
