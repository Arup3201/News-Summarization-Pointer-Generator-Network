A teenage girl who felt like Frankenstein after suffering from a cancer that gave her 20 tumours in her neck has entered a beauty pageant to regain her confidence. 

Clemmie Huckerby, 18, was only diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June this year but has made an incredible recovery.

Doctors found 20 tumours growing in her - one the size of a Satsuma - and acted quickly to remove them.

Clemmie Huckerby from Great Malvern was diagnosed with thyroid cancer earlier this year. The 18-year-old had the tumours removed through surgery this summer and resulting scar left her feeling like Frankenstein

As a result of the surgery, Clemmie was left with a scar running down the side of her neck from just below her right ear.

Despite the major surgery only taking place four months ago, the teenager from Great Malvern, Worcestershire, is already into the finals of Miss Worcestershire.

Clemmie said: 'When I woke up from surgery I felt like Frankenstein - there was this massive scar.

'I had always been confident about my looks beforehand, but it made me really insecure.

'I'm starting to feel better about myself now and I want to use the pageant to raise awareness of thyroid cancer.

'It goes under the radar a bit and doesn't get as much press as it should.'

Clemmie spent much of the summer in hospital recovering from surgery 

Clemmie wasn't aware of the massive lump in her throat and only went to the doctor after weeks of being tired.

As an avid horse rider, she was used to getting up early and being very active.

All of a sudden the 18-year-old found it impossible to get out of bed and was constantly drained of energy.

Clemmie said: 'I felt silly going to the doctors 'just' because I was tired.

'The doctor asked me to swallow and immediately noticed the lump in my throat.

'I had a biopsy that didn't show anything but a subsequent CT scan showed I had 20 tumours in my throat - one was even the size of a satsuma.

The scar that was left after surgery left Clemmie feeling insecure about her looks 

'After they confirmed it was cancer I had a course of radio-iodine treatment to kill off the cancerous cells.'

Since recovering from her treatment, and subsequently celebrating her 18th birthday, Clemmie has raised more than £1000 for thyroid cancer charities.

She is hoping that by appearing- and hopefully winning - in the finals of Miss Worcestershire on Sunday November 2 will increase donations.

The 18-year-old said: 'Of course I'd love to win - just like all of the girls involved.

'The main thing for me though is to raise awareness and make sure people are more aware of the symptoms.

'Fingers crossed we can make a bit more money too!'
