Genius: Tanishq Abraham, 10, has become one of the youngest people to graduate high school

While most 10-year-olds are busy climbing trees or riding bikes, child genius Tanishq Abraham has graduated high school and is ready to join university.

A true child prodigy, he has become one of the youngest people to graduate from high school.

His meteoric rise through academia started early, with college classes beginning at the age of seven.

Tanishq joined Mensa, a group for people whose IQ is in the top two percent of the population, at the age of four.

He

 has also written astronomy blogs for NASA in which he discusses his 
'cool' adult classmates and college professor, and his love for subjects
 
foreign to any normal kids his own age - the theories of special 
relativity, fundamental particles, and astrobiology.

The
 10-year-old from Sacramento, Northern California, received his 
graduation diploma at a private ceremony in front of friends and family 
on Sunday.

He even received a congratulatory letter from the White House.

Homeschooled and graduating with a 4.0 GPA, he told news network KXTV the work wasn't easy, but not that hard either.

'The way my brain works is that when you 
give me something, information about that topic comes into my mind," he 
said. "I don't know what it is, but that's how it is for me.'

Tanishq is taking college courses and 
says he wants to be a scientist, but also president. He now has his sights 
set on medical school at the University of California, Davis, and 
finding a cure for cancer.
