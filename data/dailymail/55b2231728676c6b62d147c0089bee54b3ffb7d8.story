An Argentinian woman suffering treatment-resistant cancer has reunited with her father after an absence of 18 years - and he may be able to help cure her disease.

Malen Gaynor, 39, of Buenos Aires was told by doctors that her only hope was to find a bone marrow donor after chemotherapy proved ineffective in treating her leukemia.

Gaynor decided to seek out her father when other family members' bone marrow proved incompatible with her own.

Reunited family: Malen Gaynor, a mother of one, had fallen out of contact with her father for almost two decades when they reconnected on Facebook

Brave battle: Malen Gaynor was diagnosed with cancer last Christmas

'I decided to contact my dad when they suggested the... transplant, which they could do with 50 per cent compatibility. It's a chance, if a 100 per cent compatible unrelated donor doesn't show up,' Gaynor said, reports EFE.

She set up a Facebook page, called Hoy Dono Vida (Today I Donate Life) to raise awareness about bone marrow donations.

Gaynor had lost contact with her father almost decades earlier after her parents' divorce.

Through a Facebook search, Gaynor found her father, whow as living in Cordoba, a city about 400 miles west of Buenos Aires.

New hope: Gaynor's half-brother has just been tested and her father will be tested early June to see if their bone marrow is compatible

She was also reunited with her half-brother, whom she hadn't seen since he was a baby and who was living in the same city as her.

Her half-brother has already had a blood analysis test to see if his bone marrow is compatible.

'My dad is coming on June 4 to have it done also,' Gaynor told EFE.

The mother of one was diagnosed with a bone marrow disease that turned 
into leukemia last Christmas when she went to the doctor with what she 
thought was a bite from an insect.

Gaynor says that being reunited with her family has brought peace as well as the possibility of survival.

'I feel that I've reconciled with my past,' she told EFE.
