To be happy is to be alone – or at least live in some of the most remote parts of the British Isles.

By contrast those who live in over-crowded cities like London and Liverpool are more likely to be anxious, unhappy and unsatisfied with life.

However experts analysing the wellbeing of the nation reveal the overall happiness of the nation may have been boosted by falling unemployment and the London Olympics.

Happy nation: In the last year happiness has increased in Scotland and Northern Island, but have fallen in the south of England

Areas with the highest average ratings for happiness:

1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland

2. Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland

3. Scottish Highlands

4. Gwynedd, Wales

5. Perth and Kinross, Scotland

Areas with the lowest average ratings for happiness:

1. Bedford, Bedfordshire

2. Merseyside, North West England

3. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands

4. North Lanarkshire, Scotland

5. Caerphilly, Wales

People who live in Orkney, Shetland and Eilean Siar report the highest levels of life satisfaction, self -worth and happiness across the whole of Great Britain, new data shows from the Office for National Statistics.

Locals also have very low levels of anxiety, coming second in the table only to Dumfries and Galloway, the ONS said.

Dawn Snape, head of personal wellbeing at the ONS, said: ‘It looks like Eilean Siar is the place to be.’

But on a regional basis London had the lowest average rating for life satisfaction and the highest average rating for anxiety, both higher than the UK average. In a breakdown of council areas, people living in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands have the lowest levels of self-worth and life satisfaction.

People in the area are also unhappy - reporting the third lowest levels of happiness in the nation behind Bedford and Merseyside.

Worthwhile: People living in London and other big cities were less likely to have high levels of life satisfaction

Areas with the highest average ratings for life satisfaction:

1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland

2. Scottish Highlands

3. Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland

4. Wokingham, Berkshire

5. Scottish Borders

Areas with the lowest average ratings for life satisfaction:

1. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands

2. Inner London

3. Newport, Wales

4. Blackburn and Darwen, Lancashire

5. Torfaen, Wales

Meanwhile, Reading, Milton Keynes and inner London all ranked in the top six worst places for high levels of anxiety.

People from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales and Brighton and Hove also have high levels of anxiousness, the ONS said.

More than one in five Londoners (22.4 per cent) questioned said they had high anxiety levels.

Ms Snape said: ‘London has the most disposable income but very little life satisfaction and very high anxiety.’

People living in the capital could be especially hit by stressful jobs or mortgage problems, analysts said.

Ms Snape added: ‘There are huge disparities within London, for instance average life expectancy in Tower Hamlets is 78.8 compared to 84 in Kensington and Chelsea, and we know that health is a really important factor contributing to personal wellbeing.’

Change: Increasing levels of personal wellbeing were blamed on rising employment and the London Olympics

Areas with the highest average ratings for self-worth:

1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland

2. Scottish Highlands

3. Clackmannanshire, Scotland

4. Moray, Scotland

5. Anglesey, Wales

Areas with the lowest average ratings for self-worth

1. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands

2. Dundee, Scotland

3. Glasgow, Scotland

4. Newport, Wales

5. North Ayrshire, Scotland

The data, which was collated by polling 165,000 people, also paints a picture of wellbeing across the UK.

ONS officials asked people to rate how satisfied they are with their lives, how worthwhile they feel their lives are, how happy they feel and how anxious they feel on a scale of zero to 10 - zero being ‘not at all’ and 10 being ‘completely’.

They found that the highest proportion of people who gave the top scores for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness were in Northern Ireland.

England had the lowest proportion of people who gave themselves the top scores for happiness and life satisfaction.

Meanwhile Scotland appears to be the most laid-back country - having the highest proportion of people who gave themselves very low anxiety scores.

The ONS report stresses that the reasons behind the local variations are ‘complex and not yet fully understood’, but it says that the factors most associated with personal wellbeing are health, employment and relationship status.
