Fall: Carer Carole Conway fell 20 ft down the empty lift shaft with May Lewis

A great-grandmother died after falling 20ft down an empty lift shaft at a care home and breaking 52 bones, an inquest has heard.

May Lewis, 96, died instantly when her wheelchair was pushed into the lift shaft by a carer.

Carole Conway, a carer at the Pontcanna House home in Cardiff, Wales, also fell but survived.

An inquest in Cardiff heard how Mrs Conway didn't notice that the lift had not arrived when its doors opened on the top floor of the home.

She reversed Mrs Lewis's chair into the lift and the pair fell.

The carer of 19 years told the inquest: 'I did not look inside before I stepped in, I just assumed it was there.

'The lift was playing up - we always had problems with it.

'I just remember being on the floor with the wheelchair on top of me.'

Frail Mrs Lewis had moved into the care home just five days earlier.

She suffered 52 fractures to her 
ribcage, internal bleeding and fractures to her spine, skull and pelvis 
as a result of the fall in March last year.

Kerry Hill, a supervisor at Pontcanna House, said : 'I heard a shout and I thought someone had fallen over.

'I can still picture May's face. I thought we had lost Carole too.

'I hate lifts. I would never go in there on my own.'

Staff
at the home had routinely used an emergency key to access the lift when
mechanical failures prevented the door from opening automatically.

But they had been warned that using the key could be dangerous.

Tragic: May Lewis, 96, died after falling 20ft down an empty lift shaft at the Pontcanna House care home in Cardiff

Deputy care manager Brenda Norman said: 'The lift did malfunction. Once we had to call the fire brigade because a resident and a carer got stuck between floors.

'After the incident a key was made available to staff members to free anyone trapped at ground-floor level in an emergency.

'I did not know the key was being used on a routine basis. If management had known, we would not have let it carry on.'

Mrs Lewis's daughter Brenda Jones told the inquest: 'When I last saw my mother, she was enjoying a sing along at the home.

'She was tapping a tambourine and smiling. I had no qualms about the quality of her care.'

But Ms Jones received a call from the home five days later.

She said: 'I could tell something serious had happened - I knew instinctively my mum was dead.'

The inquest continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
