With his white hair, thick-rimmed spectacles, and cardigan, he is perhaps the unlikeliest of reggae icons.

But at 72 and after earning himself a cult following, DJ Derek - Britain’s oldest DJ -  is hanging up his headphones and taking his final spin after decades at the decks.

Over the years he has been spinning records, DJ Derek - real name Derek Morris - has reached legend status, starred in music videos with stars including Dizzee Rascal and played with groups like Massive Attack.

At 72, DJ Derek - Britain¿s oldest DJ -  is hanging up his headphones and taking his final spin after decades at the decks

Over the years he has been spinning records, DJ Derek - real name Derek Morris - has earned himself a cult following as a reggae legend

The unlikely white-haired DJ has even starred in music videos with stars including Dizzee Rascal and played with groups like Massive Attack

Now he will see out 2013 in style and play his last show on New Year's Eve at Notting Hill Arts Club in London.

He said: 'This New Year’s Eve will be last gig I do there and will also be my last ever gig.

'I turned 72 this month and while I’m reasonably healthy it’ll be nice to do some travelling without carting my gear around.'

Mr Morris, from St Paul’s, Bristol, gave up work as an accountant at chocolate makers Cadbury after 18 years to become a full time performer.

He is known for his reggae collection and has played at some of the UK’s largest festivals including Glastonbury and The Big Chill.

He said: 'I was not even a DJ when I was at Cadbury.

'I was originally a washboard player in a local skiffle group and then a drummer in The Ramrods, a Bristol rock’n’roll group.

'But even back then I knew I loved black music more than I loved rock’n’roll and I used to see all the blues artists who came to play gigs in Bristol.'

His love of reggae and a growing record collection eventually led him to start DJ-ing at local pubs for beer money.

But the cardigan wearing DJ’s popularity has grown in recent years and he was awarded a local 'OBE' - for outstanding Bristolian entertainer- at his final outdoor show at Bristol’s Harbour Festival in July.

Mr Morris plans to spend his retirement travelling and visiting more of his beloved local pubs and listening to his favourite music at home.
