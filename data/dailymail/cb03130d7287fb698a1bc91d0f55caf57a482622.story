Government workers attempted for a second day to block off the World War II Memorial to visitors in Washington due to the shutdown, but a group of veterans returned to the site anyway and blew past the barricades.

The veterans, many of whom had also breached the gates on Tuesday, were accompanied this time by Republican senators Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt, both of Missouri.

Reporters on the scene said that just before the veterans arrived, a handful of National Park employees were working to reinforce metal barricades around the memorial. They were also posting signs announcing that the site was off limits due to the government shutdown.

National Mall and Memorial Parks 
spokeswoman Carol Johnson said she and her colleague were ordered by the
 White House Office of Management and Budget to close the site, 
according to Charlie Spiering of the Washington Examiner.

When
 veterans arrived on the scene a short time later and blew past the 
barricades, Johnson tweeted that they would be allowed access.

'The
 Honor Flights [veterans] are being granted access to the WWII Memorial 
to conduct 1st Amendment actives in accordance with NPS regulations,' 
she tweeted.

The scene of 
the veterans trying to access the memorial on Tuesday was arguably the 
most dramatic of the shutdown so far, which is now in its second day.

The memorial is technically closed due to the government shutdown, but was opened today and yesterday for visiting veteran groups

Hundreds
 of veterans had arrived for a previously scheduled visit to the 
memorial Tuesday morning to find it barricaded by the National Park 
Service after the shutdown went into effect at midnight.

But the group of vets who had traveled from Mississippi were not to be deterred and 'stormed' into the memorial.

Members
 of Congress, including Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, 
and Steven Palazzo, of Mississippi, rushed to the site after receiving 
panicked emails and cut police tape to let in the veterans.

'I
 find it disappointing and disgusting for our country to have to go 
through this,' said Bob Hunter, 90, of Gulfport, Mississippi to the Daily News.

Mr

radio transmitter on top as a member of the Army Signal Corps in World 
War II.

'I feel like we deserve better,' Hunter said. 'Somewhere, somehow, somebody screwed up.'

Tom Lucas, of Pontotoc, Mississippi was one of five brothers who fought in World War II, said the memorial’s closure 'hurt us.'

'I crossed the North Atlantic 20 times on convoy duty,' said Mr Lucas, 87, to the Daily News. 'I ended up in Tokyo Bay for the signing of the surrender.'

'We did our share, and the last thing people should do is not let us in and not let people open the gate.'

'We took on the Germans and the Japs and we whipped them, and then we have to take this sort of thing? It makes you wonder if these people work for the U.S government or for themselves.' 

MIchalle Bachmann said it was ‘pure joy’ when 
members of the greatest generation were allowed in because they had 
traveled so far to honor their fallen comrades.

She
 added that her fellow congressmen and women plan to continue coming 
down to the memorial every day while the shutdown continues to ensure 
veterans’ access.

‘America is not shutting down,’ she told CNN. ‘If we have anything to say about it, we're going to keep this open.’

Park
 spokeswoman Carol Johnson said the service didn't want to keep veterans
 out, but the agency was directed to close all memorials after the 
Congress failed to approve a budget resolution, leading to the first 
government shutdown in 17 years.

A long-running dispute between Democrats
 and Republicans over President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act 
stalled a temporary funding bill, forcing about 800,000 federal workers 
off the job and suspending most non-essential federal programs and 
services.

‘We’re looking about how to deal with this in the future,’ Johnson said.

Leo Shane III, a reporter for the newspaper Stars and Stripes who was present at the memorial, tweeted that he witnessed Rep Steve King, of Iowa, distracting a Park Service officer while veterans knocked down the barricades.

Members of The Mississippi Gulf Honor Flight - a nonprofit group that arranges free visits to the WWII Memorial for veterans - made their way to the capital visit the memorial.

Wayne Lennep, a spokesman for the organization, said they had planned the visit long before the shutdown and could not cancel the pilgrimage to the memorial.

The 91 veterans, many of them wheelchair-bound or using walking canes to get around, arrived at Reagan National Airport in an $80,000 chartered plane Tuesday morning.

They boarded buses and arrived at the
 memorial at around 11.30am, only to discover metal fences around the 
site and printed signs announcing that the memorial has been closed due 
to the government shutdown.

Even
 though park police officers were patrolling the area, they made no 
attempts to stop the veterans and congressmen who came to their aid from
 moving the barriers and entering the site.

‘I thought I was going to have to stand back when we first got here,’ veteran Robert Meredith told The Epoch Times. ‘I feel extremely lucky. This is really nice, a great honor.’

The gray-haired and stooped visitors were able to lay a wreath at the Mississippi pillar and take pictures before leaving the site less than an hour later.

Besides the travelers from Mississippi, a group of veterans from Iowa dressed in bright yellow shirts were also allowed to access the memorial.

At the Korean War Memorial, a group of veterans from Puerto Rico also stormed the barricades to lay a wreath, The Washington Post reported.

Rep. Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, called the veterans’ bold actions ‘the best civil disobedience we've seen in Washington in a while,’ according to The Gulf Live.

The veterans’ decision to ignore the shutdown and move fences aside in order to pay their respects to military heroes has drawn bipartisan support from members of the House and Senate alike.

Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, posted on Twitter that he would be donating his pay during the shutdown to the Honor Flight organization in his home state, while Republican Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, simply tweeted, ‘Good for them.’
