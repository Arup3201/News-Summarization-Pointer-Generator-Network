The owner of a Lamborghini Aventador has advertised his car for sale but only those who can read Arabic need apply.

The two-door, two-seater sports car, worth around £320,000, has been spotted parked in wealthy Sloane Street, West London, with a 'for sale' sign in the front window.

But maybe the owner thinks us Brits can't afford it because the sign has been written in Arabic.

For sale: The Lamborghini Aventador was spotted on London's Sloane Street with a sign written in Arabic

Only those who can read Arabic may apply: This sign was placed in the front window of the Lamborghini Aventador

The sign reads: 'Lamborghini Aventador 1400km on the clock 2013 serious bidders call.'

Knightsbridge is known for Arab boy racers weaving their way through one of Britain's most exclusive areas throughout the summer in their expensive sports cars.

But residents of Knightsbridge - which has an average house price of £3.6million and is home to Harrods - say the drivers from the Gulf region are ‘a manifestation of too much-ness’.

The petrol-heads and their motors are cheered on by camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi, but are hated by a number of furious residents who claim their lives are being ruined.

Their behaviour was revealed in a recent Channel 4 documentary which has followed the rich youngsters as they prepared to leave the Gulf for the UK and spend three months in London.

Anyone with a cool £320,000 might want to treat themselves to this Lamborghini Aventador for sale

Knightsbridge resident Panda Morgan-Thomas, 59, has been leading a campaign to clamp down on the unruly driving - and she said it has become a constant pain every summer in recent years.

She said at the time: ‘I'm inundated with local residents complaining, not being able to sleep and I think people's tempers are getting somewhat jaded. It is quite difficult to be sleep deprived and carry on with a normal life.’

Even though they regularly complain to police and even write to embassies, the locals admit they haven't actually spoken to any of the young men in their supercars.

Since 1998 Lamborghini has been part of Audi and its cars have mixed German engineering with Italian flair.
