Kevin Durant has a fractured right foot and the NBA's MVP seems likely to be sidelined for at least the start of the season.

The Oklahoma City Thunder said Durant informed the team of 'discomfort' in his right foot after practice a day earlier. He underwent tests and the team said Sunday in a statement he was diagnosed with a 'Jones' fracture - a broken bone at the base of the small toe. It's unclear how the injury happened.

The Thunder said traditional treatment requires surgery, and recent NBA cases have resulted in a return to play in six to eight weeks.

'We are in the process of collaboratively evaluating the most appropriate next steps with Kevin, his representatives, and Thunder medical personnel,' general manager Sam Presti said. 'Until a course of action is determined, we are unable to provide a timeline specific to Kevin's case.'

Durant won the scoring title last season, collected his first MVP award and led the Thunder to the Western Conference finals. He skipped playing for the U.S. national team in this summer's Basketball World Cup so he could get additional rest. He played in two pre-season games before complaining of pain.
