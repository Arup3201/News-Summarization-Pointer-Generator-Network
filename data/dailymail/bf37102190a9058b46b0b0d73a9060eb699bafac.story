A BBC Newsnight journalist rushed his heavily-pregnant girlfriend to hospital - only for her to give birth yards from the entrance in the couple's Vauxhall Astra.

Business correspondent Joe Lynam briefly left girlfriend Riina in their car while he went to get help help from staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after she went into labour at 2am this morning.

But by the time he returned a few minutes later, Riina had already given birth to their 7lb baby son Sean on the front seat of the Astra.

The jubilant 42-year-old Dublin-born journalist later tweeted: 'Wow! My amazing partner has given birth to our 2nd son in the front seat of my car!! Mum & baby Sean safely in hospital and fine.'

The pair, who already have a 
16-month-old son called Eduard, had been at their home in Ealing, West 
London, when Riina, 41, went into the final stages of labour.

Lynam rushed her to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in West London but Riina revealed halfway through the journey that the baby was coming.

Lynam
revealed: 'I said: "You have got to be joking?" Up until then I’d been 
observing all the traffic lights, but at that point I put my foot down 
and, I’m afraid to say, I broke every red light between Ealing and 
Chelsea.

'She then said: "This baby is crowning - I can feel its head".'

Mr Lynam pulled up outside the hospital at 2am, and tried to attract the attention of staff. But when he returned to the car she announced she had delivered the baby herself.

He said: 'I could not believe it. Riina is not a whinger and she was in a lot of pain, but I did not realise this child would be born in the front seat of my car.

'She was not upset or crying. She 
looked at me and said: "There it is". Thank God it was a warm June day 
and we had not been stuck on the A316 somewhere in winter.'

Doctors and nurses arrived and took the mother and baby to the maternity ward so they could be checked over.

He added: 'I just keep thinking how amazing Riina is to have delivered Sean all by herself. I am in awe of her.'

Baby names: The business correspondent joked hat the couple thought about calling their son upholstery - they eventually decided on Sean instead

Today show and Dragons’ Den presenter Evan Davis tweeted: 'You can call him Mondeo. Well done to both of you. But particularly Riina. Glad it is all ok.'

Meanwhile, another mother was today recovering after giving birth just off the A13 road in Essex.

Alison Chalk, from Grays, was being rushed by ambulance to Basildon Hospital when her 5lb 7oz baby Amy began to arrive.

A paramedic who had never delivered a child before urged the driver to pull over so the baby could be born.

The baby girl will now be registered as having been born 'on the A1014 Manorway in Corringham, Essex'.

Alison said: 'At the time it was quite traumatic, but now we can look back and laugh.'
