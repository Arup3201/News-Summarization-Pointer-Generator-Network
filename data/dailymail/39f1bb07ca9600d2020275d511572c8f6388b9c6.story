Motorists in Brighton and Hove have reacted angrily after the council started removing cash parking meters and encouraged them to pay by phone

Motorists have reacted angrily after a city council started removing parking meters to encourage them to pay by mobile phone.

The move away from simple pay and display to an online system has already led to one driver being charged more than £5,000 after they entered the wrong digits on their phone.

Residents in Brighton and Hove have complained that it is making parking unnecessarily complicated.

But the Green Party-controlled council insists paying by phone can be easier because drivers no longer have to scrabble around to find the right change.

Many councils across the country have started to allow drivers to pay for parking on their mobile phones.

In Brighton and Hove, half of all coin-fed meters will have disappeared by June as part of a cost-cutting move. Instead drivers will have to register online at home or from their mobile phones in the street when they want to park.

Payments are made by calling an automated service, sending a text or using a smartphone app. It costs 10p to pay by phone or motorists can skip the charge by going to a local shop to pay.

No tickets need to be displayed and parking wardens instead check whether people have paid by checking car numberplates on mobile devices.

Steve Percy, of local campaign group People’s Parking Protest, said that the council is unfairly punishing motorists.

‘I’m infuriated,’ he said. ‘Not everyone has a mobile phone and you cannot always get signal ... It is especially unfair on older people.’

The council has said that it could remove all parking meters by 2017.

Earlier this year it emerged that a motorist was hit with a £5,340 ticket after inadvertently entering the wrong amount while trying to pay for parking that should have cost them £15.30.

Elsewhere, some London boroughs have reduced the number of pay and display machines to lower costs. 

In Camden the council introduced a new policy where the nearest parking meter can be up to a five-minute walk away. 

In November toll booths were removed on the Dartford Crossing between Essex and Kent.

Motorists now pay the charge online, by text message or by phone, and it is enforced using numberplate recognition cameras.
