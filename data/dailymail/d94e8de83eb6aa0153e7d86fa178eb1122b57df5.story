A Nasa notebook was stolen last year that contained the instructions for controlling the International Space Station, the Agency’s inspector general has revealed.

Paul K Martin told the U.S Congress yesterday in a testimony highlighting Nasa’s security challenges, that the notebook was one of 48 mobile computing devices belonging to the Agency that was lost or stolen between April 2009 and April 2011.

In a written report he said: ‘The March 2011 theft of an unencrypted Nasa notebook computer resulted in the loss of the algorithms used to command and control the International Space Station.

‘Other lost or stolen notebooks 
contained Social Security numbers and sensitive data on Nasa’s 
Constellation and Orion programs.

‘Moreover, Nasa cannot consistently 
measure the amount of sensitive data exposed when employee notebooks are
 lost or stolen because the Agency relies on employees to self-report 
regarding the lost data rather than determining what was stored on the 
devices by reviewing backup files.’

According to Mr Martin, Nasa reported
 5,408 computer security incidents between 2010 and 2011. These involved
 either malicious software being installed or an unauthorised person 
accessing its systems.

He said that ‘skilled and committed 
cyber attackers could choose to cause significant disruption to Nasa 
operations, as IT networks are central to all aspects of Nasa’s 
operations’.

Mr Martin drew Congresses attention to the slow pace of encryption for Nasa’s laptops and lack of IT security monitoring.

The news follows the revelation from 
an audit that since 1970 more than 500 pieces of moon rock, meteorites, 
comet chunks and other space material have been stolen or lost.

Nasa, which has lent out more than 
26,000 samples, needs to keep better track of what is sent to 
researchers and museums, a report by its inspector general warned 
recently, or it ‘increases the risk these unique resources may be lost’.

The audit, of a quarter of the loaned samples, found 19 per cent of researchers could not account for samples, or held items that Nasa records showed were on loan to someone else.

One researcher still had nine lunar samples he borrowed 35 years ago and had never worked on them. Another still had 36 moon samples he has finished studying 16 years earlier.

The audit also unearthed records that listed hundreds of samples that no longer existed.

In 2010's Delaware case, Nasa loaned the Mount Cuba observatory a disk of moon rocks and moon dust in 1978 with the loan expiring in 2008.

According to the report, Nasa contacted the observatory in 2010 to learn that its manager had died and the observatory couldn't find the sample.

However according to the astronomers the samples had been returned to Nasa.

University of Delaware physics 
professor Harry Shipman, a trustee of the observatory, claimed that 
while it was true that the manager had died, the sample had been 
returned.

He said: 'We didn't lose it.

'We returned it to Nasa. We don't know what Nasa did with it.'

Nasa
 told the auditors that the observatory returned meteorites, but not the
 lunar sample which is still missing, said inspector general spokeswoman
 Renee Juhans.

Nasa 
spokesman Michael Cabbage said the agency will continue to loan out 
material to scientists and for educational display, but will adopt the 
specific recommendations the inspector general made to improve its 
tracking.

'Nasa does not consider these national treasure assets to be at high risk,' he said.

The report concluded that the lack of sufficient controls 'increases the risk that these unique resources may be lost'.
