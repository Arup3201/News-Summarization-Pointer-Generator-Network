A model who claimed retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya assaulted her wants him to apologise and pay her $5million in damages for taking 'advantage of her in every way possible'.

Angelica Marie Cecora, 25, claimed at a lawsuit hearing that he held a drug-fuelled hotel romp last March, wore women’s underwear and intimidated her and her friend when they tried to leave.

‘It would be nice to start with an 
apology,’ said the Maxim and Playboy model outside court on Wednesday, dressed demurely in a 
ruffled shirt, short skirt and heels.

‘Oscar needs to acknowledge his mistakes,’ Ms Cecora, reported the New York Daily News. ‘He knows he did something wrong.’

After consensual sex, the married 
fighter put on Ms Cecora’s underwear and ordered drugs to his room at 
New York's Ritz Hotel, the lawsuit said.

He allegedly then requested an extreme sex act and Ms Cecora obliged before having her roommate come over with sex toys.

Ms Cecora and her friend then fell 
asleep but De La Hoya allegedly tried to pull her out of bed three times
 for more sex, reported the Daily News.

She was ‘afraid to leave the hotel 
room because she feared the defendant would attempt to have sex with her
 against her will,’ the lawsuit said.

Suites at the lavish Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South in Manhattan go for up to an eye-watering $4,500 a night.

He allegedly ran off in the morning and left the women with a $1,500 bill for the room. They in turn ran off, but Ms Cecora claims De La Hoya's manager called her later on to try to settle the bills, reported X17 Online.

She is not pursuing criminal charges, but Ms Cecora is seeking damages for 
imprisonment, emotional distress, assault and battery. The retired 
boxer's lawyer said this was all a con.

Judd Burstein told the court that the 
worst thing she experienced was missing a dentist appointment the next 
morning, reported the Daily News.

The attorney wanted sanctions imposed 
on Ms Cecora’s lawyer, Tony Evans, for bringing a ‘frivolous’ suit filled
 with ‘salacious’ allegations.

‘I’m embarrassed to have to argue this
 case,’ Mr Burstein said, reported the New York Post - adding she just 
wanted another ‘15 minutes of fame’.

But Mr Evans responded by saying the 
case facts are ‘salacious because the acts of Mr De La Hoya were 
deviant’, reported the Daily News.

‘It’s a man against a woman in a hotel
 room,’ Mr Evans said, reported the Post. ‘(He) was a 
professional boxer who’s knocked out 34 people.’

 1992 Olympic gold medallist De Lay Hoya, of Los Angeles, California, is
 worth $175million and generated $700million in pay-per-view TV revenue 
during his career.

Known as
 'Golden Boy', his idol is Sugar Ray Leonard and he has a professional 
record of defeating 17 world champions and winning 10 world titles in 
six different weights.

His most famous wins were against 
Mexican great Julio Cesar 'Caesar of Boxing' Chavez in 1996 and Pernell 
'Sweet Pea' Whittaker in 1997. He retired in April 2009 and is now a 
boxing promoter.

Mr Burstein told the court that De La 
Hoya began rehabilitation therapy last spring because his life had 
spiralled out of control.

De La Hoya became the subject of a photo scandal in 2007 when Siberian beauty Milana Dravnel claimed he had cheated on his wife with her and posted embarrassing images of him in lingerie on the internet.

At the time, the De La Hoya camp claimed it wasn’t him in the photos and that the stripper was 'out for money'.

His legal team even brought in their own ‘photo expert’, who said the photos were a computer-generated forgery.

But in an interview last autumn, he revealed:  'Let me tell you - yes, yes, it was me.'

TheSmokingGun.com reported that in June 2008, Ms Dravnel settled a federal lawsuit she brought against De La Hoya. Details of the settlement were never revealed as they signed confidentiality agreements.

He labelled Ms Cecora ‘a prostitute 
and a grifter’ in court papers and said the boxer had become a ‘changed man’, 
reported the Post.

But Mr Evans claimed De La Hoya used 
his fame to manipulate Ms Cecora and had told her she would be used as a
 ringside girl in his boxing promotion work.

'It's
 the old Hollywood show business story,' he said. 'Find a girl who wants
 to be a model and say: "Oh you can come work for me".'

De La Hoya admitted a cocaine 
addiction in September and said photos of him from 2007 dressed in 
fishnets and lingerie were authentic.

The Olympic gold medallist was not at 
the Manhattan Supreme Court hearing - during which his lawyers asked that the lawsuit is dismissed - but denies the attack. The judge
 reserved a decision.

De La Hoya's wife Millie Corretjer, 
whom he married 10 years ago and has two children with, has not 
publically commented on the case.

This was the second time De La Hoya has been accused of wearing women’s underwear.

The first woman to do so, Siberian beauty Milana Dravnel, was rumoured to have been paid $20million to go away in 2008.
