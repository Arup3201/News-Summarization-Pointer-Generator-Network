Former Arsenal title-winner Alan Smith believes the club's Premier League challenge this season is already over and the best that they can achieve is another top four finish.

The Gunners left it late to defeat Southampton 1-0 at home on Wednesday night courtesy of an Alexis Sanchez strike - a result that moves the Gunners up to sixth in the Premier League.

However, Smith feels the gap between the Emirates outfit and league leaders Chelsea is already insurmountable after 14 matches, despite Arsene Wenger's belief that they can still overhaul Jose Mourinho's side.

The Blues are unbeaten this season and sit top of the table on 36 points - 13 ahead of their bitter London rivals - and the former England striker is adamant Arsenal must set their sights lower and focus on achieving qualification for the Champions League next season.

Speaking on TalkSPORT's Hawksbee and Jacobs show, the 1988-89 and 1990-91 First Division winner with Arsenal said: 'I can see them having a good run, they have done it in years gone by, but I can't see them getting the kind of results that give them that proper belief that they are title challengers.

'I think they are a better team going forward now, without question, but you look back to their defensive weaknesses and think of the Anderlecht game, the Swansea game, the Man United game and have they erased it from their game?

'We will have to see when they come up against better opposition in the months to come. I don't see them as a title-challenging team.

'They will finish in the top four, no danger. I think them and Manchester United will be vying for those third and fourth places, but I cannot see them getting to the level of Chelsea.'
