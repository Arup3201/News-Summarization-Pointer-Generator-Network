Police are questioning a 20-year-old man after he was arrested following a fatal assault in Leeds yesterday morning.

Mwila Chitalu, 30, died from suspected 
head injuries shortly after his body was found in the Hyde Park area of 
Leeds at 8.45am on Sunday.

The suspect, 20, from Bradford, is one of ten people who were initially 
arrested on suspicion of murder.

Two local men, aged 20 and 22, have been released on bail along with one 21-year-old woman, who is a student from the area.

Six others, five men and one woman, aged 
between 20 and 30, have been released without charge. Four of them are 
registered as students.

Chitalu, who lived locally, is reported to have been at a nearby house party before he was fatally attacked. It is not known if those arrested were at the house party with him.

Neighbours said that the party went on until at least 6am on Sunday morning, with loud music had been playing through the night.

Several residents even reported hearing fireworks being let off in the back garden.

Today police were standing guard outside one three storey, £295,000 end-of-terrace property where the gathering was thought to have taken place, and near to where they body was found.

One 20-year-old man is still being questioned in police custody, while two more men, aged 22 and 20, have been bailed along with a 21-year-old woman

The leafy area of Leeds is filled with large eight or nine-bedroom homes and is a popular area with students

Today there were just a handful of officers standing guard outside the property, as cordons were taken down from the surrounding roads.

One local resident, who did not want to be identified, said: 'It’s so shocking. It’s scary to live so close to something like that.

'I did hear noises last night, but you don’t relate to them because students round here are generally a bit noisy and you get used to it.'

The leafy suburban road is made up of large eight or nine 
bedroom homes and is a popular area for students.

Officers are continuing to appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team via the non-emergency number 101.

Information can also be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
