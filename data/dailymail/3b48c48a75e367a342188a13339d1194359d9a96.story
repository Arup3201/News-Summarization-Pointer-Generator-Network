Not only did Petr Cech get dropped for Chelsea's opening Premier League game against Burnley but, to add insult to exclusion, the keeper's name was misspelt as a substitute on the official team sheet.

Jose Mourinho has chosen to start with the returning Thibaut Courtois for Monday evening's game at Turf Moor, casting doubt over the 32-year-old's future at Stamford Bridge.

Having collected three Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time in west London,you might think the Czech Republic keeper would be a recognisable name to most.

Oops! Petr Cech had his name spelt wrongly on the Burnley team sheet ahead of Chelsea's opening game

Lost in translation: The Blues goalkeeper was one of several players to have his name misspelt

However, some confusion at the Clarets home saw the team sheet delivered bearing the name 'PETR CHECH'. 

At least the Blues legend can rest assured that the slight was nothing personal as new signing Felipe Luis' name was also misspelt to 'PHILIPE LUIS' and Cesar Azpilicueta was as wrongly transcribed as 'AZPILCUETA' - while the 'h' was omitted from John Obi Mikel's first name.

Paris Saint Germain are monitoring Cech's situation at Chelsea with reports they are interested in taking him to Ligue 1, despite Mourinho insisting he can keep both stoppers happy this season.

New kid on the block: Jose Mourinho has chosen to start with Thibaut Courtois in goal

Mourinho said: ‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club. We can. We are economically stable. 

'We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers?

'I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager.'
