Successful model Daphne describes her own style as 'classy-funky' and criticises the ultra-thin looks that often grace today’s catwalks.

But she admits she isn’t opposed to all the tricks of the fashion industry.

Daphne said: 'It is a shame that people always have to be so thin for fashion - but I don’t mind airbrushing, at my age I like a little bit of airbrushing.'

From a young age, Daphne’s striking hair, wide eyes and astonishing bone structure set her apart from the other models and launched her glittering career in fashion.

Daphne says her parents are responsible  for her long career: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly.

'I was brought up through the war so the phrase "make do and mend" has never done me any harm.

'I always try to make the best of everything, to stay positive and to have a healthy lifestyle.'

Daphne, who prides herself on her strong-willed attitude, was chosen to front the ‘Dare to Wear’ campaign thanks to her feisty and fearless attitude towards fashion and modelling.

Silver-haired Daphne has been the star of countless catwalk extravaganzas, campaigns such as TK Maxx and magazine spreads in a career spanning seven decades.
