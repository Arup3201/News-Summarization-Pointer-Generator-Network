Google has finally treated the internet users to a tour of the Grand Canyon... but it doesn't look like the barren and dusty land pictured in postcards.

Instead the eagerly awaited expansion of Street View showcases one of the seven wonders of the world as a lush and green expanse with extensive woods.

The internet search company in October sent staff lugging backpack-mounted Street View cameras to capture the views around the trails of the geological scar that carves a swathe across Arizona.

Those images have now been processed, stitched together and turned into panoramic, scrollable images available to view on Google Maps.

The view towards Phantom Ranch: The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon ('Ongtupqa' in the Hopi language) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it.

Outstanding natural beauty: Grand Canyon

Impact site: Google has also released a range of panoramas of the trails around nearby Meteor Crater

The collection includes more than 9,500 panoramas taken from the most popular hiking trails along the Grand Canyon's south rim and nearby Meteor Crater.

With a click of the mouse, Internet users are transported virtually for a 360-degree view of locales they may have read about only in tourist books and seen in flat, 2D images.

Google Maps product manager Ryan Falor said: 'Whether you’re planning an upcoming hike, or want to learn more about the Earth’s geological history, Google Maps can help.

'Today, we’re releasing panoramic imagery of one of the world’s most spectacular national monuments: the Grand Canyon.

'These beautiful, interactive images cover more than 75 miles of trails and surrounding roads, making our map of this area even more comprehensive, accurate and easy to use than ever before

'Take a walk down the narrow trails and exposed paths of the Grand Canyon: hike down the famous Bright Angel Trail, gaze out at the mighty Colorado River, and explore scenic overlooks in full 360-degrees.

'You’ll be happy you’re virtually hiking once you get to the steep inclines of the South Kaibab Trail.

The South Kaibab Trail: For thousands of years, the Grand Canyon area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves.

Google's unveiling of its Grand Canyon Street View marks the publication of pictures taken by its novel Trekker camera system.

The backpack-mounted device, pictured right, captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each.

Around
the Grand Canyon, GPS data is limited, so Google must compensate with 
sensors that record temperature, vibrations and the orientation of the 
device as it changes

A
removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered. Images 
will then be stitched together and made available to users in a few 
months

Google
has said it nos wants to deploy them at national forests, the narrow 
streets of Venice, Mount Everest and ancient ruins and castles.

'You’ve
seen our cars, trikes, snowmobiles and trolleys—but wheels only get you
so far. There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by
foot,' Google said last when it unveiled Trekker last summer.

'Trekker solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the Grand Canyon so anyone can explore them.

'All the equipment fits in this one backpack, and we’ve already taken it out on the slopes.'

'And rather than drive a couple hours to see the nearby Meteor Crater, a click of your mouse or tap of your finger will transport you to the rim of this otherworldly site.'

A steep-sided natural scar on the 
Arizona landscape carved by the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon is 277 
miles long, up to 18 miles wide and, in parts, up to a mile deep.

It exposes nearly two billion years of 
the Earth's geological history as the river and its tributaries cut 
their channels through layer after layer of rock.

For
thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native 
Americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves.

The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon ('Ongtupqa' in the Hopi language) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it.

The
Grand Canyon virtual tour is the latest evolution in mapping technology
for the company, which has used a rosette of cameras to photograph 
thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its Street View
feature.

Google's cameras 
already have taken users to narrow cobblestone alleys in Spain using a 
tricycle, inside the Smithsonian with a push cart and to British 
Columbia's snow-covered slopes by snowmobile.

The project began in 2007, with five 
U.S. cities mapped out with 5MP cameras mounted on Google's now-famous 
Street View cars.

Since then its cars, now equipped with 75MP cameras, 
have driven more than 5million unique miles of road across every 
continent.

Google Street 
View now covers more than 3,000 cities across 45 countries - and even a 
slice of Antarctica complete with the southern continent's resident 
penguins.

Another side revealed: Google's latest offering reveals that it doesn't look like the barren land pictured in postcards

Contradiction: Previous images of one of the seven wonders of the world show it as a barren and dry habitat

But these images 
of the Grand Canyon are the first to be taken by the company's Trekker 
platform, which allows workers on foot to collect 360 degree imagery 
with a back-pack mounted camera system.

'Our team strapped on the 
Android-operated 40lb backpacks carrying the 15-lens camera system and 
wound along the rocky terrain on foot, enduring temperature swings and a
few muscle cramps along the way,' Mr Falor said.

Google's
Trekker cameras capture images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that 
are 5MP each. A removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data as 
it is gathered.

GPS data 
around the Grand Canyon is limited, so Google was forced to compensate 
with sensors to record temperature, vibrations and the orientation of 
the device as it changes. These details were essential to developers 
given the job of stitching them back together into seamless, scrollable 
panoramas.

Hikers that were 
on the Grand Canyon trails when the data was gathered have had their 
faces blurred - an attempt by Google to ensure privacy.

The
company came in for fierce criticism in Europe and Australia after it 
emerged that it had scooped up and stored information transmitted over 
unsecured wireless networks while capturing images for Street View.

The
Grand Canyon is just the start of Google's plans for the Trekker 
backpacks. The company has said it wants to deploy them at national 
forests, to the narrow streets of Venice, Mount Everest and to ancient 
ruins and castles.
