Jailed: Matthew Scheidt, was convicted of impersonating a physician's assistant and practicing medicine without a license, at the Osceola County Courthouse in Kissimmee, Florida

A teenager who pretended to be a doctor's assistant and treated patients in a hospital emergency room has been jailed for a year.

Matthew Scheidt, 18, was found guilty of working in the Osceola Regional Medical Centre emergency room, in Florida, for weeks, changing bandages, handling intravenous drips and helping to
conduct physical examinations.

At one point he even performed CPR on a patient who suffered a drug overdose.

The Osceola County Courthouse heard the teenager had also had access to confidential medical records, and had worn scrubs and a stethoscope, used a pager and bought a lab coat.

He was convicted in August of two counts 
of practicing medicine without a license and two counts of impersonating
a physician's assistant in August 
2011, when he was 17.

He was arrested in September 2011 and released on bail.

But in January, he was back in police custody, this time for impersonating a police officer.

Scheidt told investigating police he had originally gone to the  hospital to get a badge for his job as a 
clerk at a doctor's office, which was just across the road.

But the teenager was entered as a physician assistant into the computer in error, CNN reports.

A physician assistant helps a doctor treat and administer medication to a patient, and will normally undergo a minimum of two years medical training.

He told investigators that he had performed CPR on a patient who had overdosed: 'I felt so uncomfortable even doing 
that.

'And, you know, the only reason why I did do it was because there 
was nobody else in there. And I'm not going to let her die.'

Scheidt said he had 'messed up' but that he had just wanted to learn as much as possible.

He admitted he 'should 
have addressed the issue' earlier.

'I just didn't want any
questions asked, like I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly 
could,' he added.

He was sentenced on Wednesday to a year in jail. He will then spend a year under house arrest, followed by eight years' probation.

The teenager had previously been told he could expect up to 25 years in jail. 

The case has been compared to the Leonardo DiCaprio film Catch Me If You Can, were a conman evaded justice by posing under a number of aliases. These included a doctor and a  pilot

A nursing supervisor at the hospital told CNN no one was available to comment.

Concerns: Scheidt performed physical examinations and looked through confidential medical records
