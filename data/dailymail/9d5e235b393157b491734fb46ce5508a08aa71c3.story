After much Twitter speculation, Kate Upton has been revealed as British Vogue's cover star.

Shot by acclaimed fashion photographer Mario Testino in the sun-drenched Caribbean, Kate shows off the curves that sky-rocketed her to fame.

The 21-year-old model and star of The Other Woman sports a glowing tan as she poses on the beach for the fashion bible's cover wearing a vintage-inspired Dolce & Gabanna floral swimsuit.

Big reveal: After much speculation, it's official - Kate Upton is British Vogue's June cover star and she shows off those famous curves in a floral Dolce & Gabanna swimsuit

Inside the glossy issue, Kate is the ultimate beach babe in sporty swimwear with reflective sunglasses, a pair of flippers and messy hair.

The Sport's Illustrated model is interviewed by contributing editor and fellow cover girl, Alexa Chung in the issue and discusses the impact of her famed body on the industry.

She tells the magazine: 'It's weird that in the press they'll be like, your biggest fight was with the industry and the designers, and I'm like, no, my biggest fight was with my agents, trying to get them to sign me into the castings. I thought, how I'm going to come out of this will be an example for girls.'

Speaking about her style inspirations, she says: 'I always thought Marilyn was so beautiful and iconic, it was amazing to even be mentioned in the same sentence as her.

'But I feel like nowadays it's easy to be genuine and show your personality, whereas I don't think Marilyn had that opportunity. And clearly she had a dark side, and I don't have that.'

Twitter speculation went into overdrive after British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman shared a teasing portion of the upcoming June cover - inviting fans to guess the owner of those unmistakable curves.

The photo, which was posted to British Vogue's official Instagram account yesterday morning, reveals the sun-soaked 'mystery' lady.

'Guess who's on the cover of @britishvogue's June 2014 issue?' the caption reads.

But for eagle eyes, the small horseshoe 
shaped tattoo on the bodacious model's wrist is the dead giveaway - it 
undoubtedly belongs to Kate Upton.

The second Kate to grace British Vogue's cover in as many months - supermodel Kate Moss sizzled in her latest range of Topshop designs for its May edition - the 21-year-old blonde bombshell has been busy doing the publicity rounds of late, to promote her film debut.

The Other Woman, which also stars Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and Nicki Minaj, burst into movie theaters over the weekend and quickly nabbed the number one spot in box office sales, raking in $25 million by Monday.

This will be Miss Upton's second British Vogue cover, and it would have been hot on the heels of her second American Vogue cover too, if Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hadn't bumped her off the top spot this month, seemingly at the last moment.

Last week, it came to light that Jonathan Van Meter, the writer who had penned the accompanying profile on Miss Upton, only found out that it been moved off the cover spot 'when it hit newsstands.'

The disgruntled writer then posted a review of the May issue, which declared his piece on Kate Upton 'the jewel' of the edition.

Kate Upton first rose to fame after starring on the cover of a somewhat less high fashion publication, Sports Illustrated, looking sultry in a barely-there red bikini.

She appeared on the cover again for its 2013 swimsuit issue, posing in little more than an unzipped arctic jacket, and has featured several other times since.

In her interview for American Vogue last month, she opened up about the fine art of emanating just the right amount of sexy.

I definitely have limits,' she said, adding: 'There's a line between becoming, you know, a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy. And I try to be very careful of that line.'

Clearly her strategy is working and Miss Upton has been fully embraced by the global Vogue clan.

She first appeared on the Italian Vogue cover in November 2012, followed by British Vogue in January 2013 and American Vogue's cover in June 2013 - where she was heralded as the 'American Dream Girl.

'I love my body,' Miss Upton declared in the accompanying interview. 'Itâ€™s what God gave me.'
