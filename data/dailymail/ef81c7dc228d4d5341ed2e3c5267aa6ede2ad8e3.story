This coat is £115 from Freemans but just £89 from Kaleidoscope

Trudging around the shops in winter can be miserable, so the popularity of catalogue and online shopping is no great surprise.

However, if you compare the prices of some of the glossy brochures that thud through your letterbox, you could be in for a shock.

A recent Freemans catalogue featured a pretty pink coat for £115 and a lace-trimmed cardigan for £65. But the Kaleidoscope catalogue had the same items at vastly reduced prices — £89 for the coat and £49 for the cardigan.

The discrepancies do not stop there. A blue and black organza peplum dress that is £89 at Kaleidoscope will cost you £115 through Freemans, while patent leather Clarks shoes are £45 and £59 respectively in these catalogues — though they’re only £39.99 on the Clarks website.

What makes these discrepancies even more astonishing is the fact that Freemans and Kaleidosope have the same parent company, Freemans Grattan Holdings.

Jan Spurling, 67, from Wanstead, East London, has shopped with both catalogues. When she spotted the price differences, she wrote to the Daily Mail.

‘I’d never noticed it before — it’s only because the catalogues arrived on the same day,’ she says. ‘I’ve been shopping with them for ten or 12 years, so I am a bit cross.’

Freemans Grattan Holdings group company secretary Andy Lord says: ‘We vary our prices and terms and conditions across our brands.

‘If one of our customers shops with one of our brands and would like to apply for an account with another because they prefer that particular offer, they are always very welcome.

‘Our prices are not based on where the customer lives. Our internet and catalogue prices are nationwide.’

But, for Jan, that doesn’t cut the mustard. ‘To charge extra on what they’re making in the other catalogue is unfair,’ she says. ‘Everyone’s money is tight these days. The last time I used the Kaleidoscope catalogue was when my daughter was going to a wedding and wanted a posh dress.

The stylish Abney dress from French Connection, costs £85 on the brand’s website. It’s the same price at Very.co.uk, but if you buy the dress at K&Co or Littlewoods, it will cost you £108

‘The one she bought cost a lot of money, but now, I think that if I’d looked at another catalogue, it might have been cheaper. I find it really annoying.’

Other companies use similar pricing tactics online and in their catalogues.

Take the stylish Abney dress from French Connection, which costs £85 on the brand’s website. It’s the same price at Very.co.uk, but if you buy the dress at K&Co or Littlewoods, it will cost you £108 — that’s a hike of £23. However, all four companies are owned by ShopDirect.

‘Very.co.uk and Littlewoods.com offer different propositions, and products are priced to reflect that difference,’ says a spokesperson for Shop Direct.

A Joanna Hope sequin and lace maxi dress is £95 at Julipa.com and £99 at Marisota.co.uk

‘The price that Littlewoods.com customers see on the website or in the catalogue is slightly higher because it includes delivery and a wider range of flexible payment options to help spread the cost of purchases — a simple offer customers tell us they value.’

N. Brown owns a range of catalogues, including Julipa.com, Fiftyplus.co.uk, Marisota.co.uk and J D Williams, which feature some of the same brands, such as Together and Joanna Hope.

A Together parka coat costs £85 at Julipa and Marisota, but at Fiftyplus.co.uk and J D Williams, it is £75 up to a size 18, rising to £89 for a size 32.

A Joanna Hope sequin and lace maxi dress is £95 at Julipa.com and £99 at Marisota.co.uk.

These sort of price differences are standard practice, says retail expert Liz Steer, who has worked with Harvey Nichols and Arcadia, which owns many High Street stores such as Topshop, BHS and Miss Selfridge.

‘Most retailers set their pricing driven by their particular brand. So, as they’re separate brands, they may have similar products, but when they decide to launch an item and put it into their range, they would decide what price that should go in at for their particular market.’

What this means is that clothes are often priced at a premium, according to what the shops or catalogues think their customers will pay.

A more upmarket catalogue may have higher prices than a cheap and cheerful one, without necessarily offering higher quality products.

This ‘dynamic pricing’ is a tough challenge for online shoppers to navigate, since retailers vary prices according to anything from the time of year to location.

Orbitz, an online travel firm in America, offers more expensive hotel deals to Apple computer users because they are statistically more likely to be willing to pay extra.

And American department store Macy’s changes its prices daily, according to demand.

British companies including B&Q have been experimenting with similar approaches. ‘Some things might have higher mark-ups than others, depending on what you believe it’s worth to the customer,’ says Liz.

‘You’re not going to have the same price for a swimsuit in Spain in September as in the UK — you’re going to think more creatively to cater for the market.

‘It’s supply and demand: if you can get more money out of it, or if you need to clear your stock and sell it cheaper.’
