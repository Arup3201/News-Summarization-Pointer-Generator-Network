The Rolling Stones have settled their   multimillion-pound  claim with insurers over a number of cancelled shows - but say they are 'deeply upset' about confidential details entering the public domain.

It has been revealed their insurance policy did not cover Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods for 'alcohol abuse'.

Richards was also not covered in case of 'liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis' or for any condition related to a fall he had from a coconut tree in Fiji in 2006 - which resulted in brain surgery.

Insurance underwriters had contested their liability to meet the costs incurred after the cancellation of concerts following the death of frontman Sir Mick Jagger's girlfriend L'Wren Scott.

Court documents filed in the US over legal action stemming from the claim suggested the singer suffered 'acute traumatic stress disorder' after Miss Scott's suicide.

The Stones are said to have taken out a £15 million insurance policy in case of any shows being cancelled due to the death of family members.

But today representatives for the group said both sides had 'settled the insurance claim'.

There were concerns among the Stones' team about private information about the group and their families being brought into the public eye without their knowledge.

A spokesman for Mr Jagger said: 'We are deeply upset that confidential medical and other private information about members of the band and their immediate family and loved ones has entered the public domain as a result of a US court filing initiated by insurers four weeks ago.

'This was done without the knowledge of the band or reference to their legal representatives.

'This has only been discovered and reported in the press in the last week, by which time we are pleased to say the insurers and the Rolling Stones had, in fact, settled the insurance claim.

'No further comment will be made about this matter.' 

A spokesman for the band failed to point this out this week despite repeated requests for comment, claiming it was an ‘ongoing legal action’.

No details about the settlement were released.

Veteran rock act the Stones postponed a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand after Miss Scott's death earlier this year and filed an £8 million claim for losses.

The lawsuit gave an unprecedented glimpse into the band’s finances and revealed they would rake in £63 million from their tour. 

The court documents, reported by the Salt Lake Tribune earlier this week, included claims that Mr Jagger was advised not to perform for at least 30 days after his 49-year-old girlfriend was found dead in her New York apartment in March.

The underwriters were said to have disputed the insurance claim on the basis that Miss Scott may have been suffering from a mental illness, meaning her death may not be covered by the policy. 

They said that Miss Scott’s suicide at the age of 49 was not beyond her control and was foreseeable as she suffered from mental issues.

It also requested information to find out if Miss Scott attempted suicide or self harmed in the past.

In July, Mr Jagger spoke to NBC's Today show about how he was coping in the aftermath of her death.

'I'm doing OK. It's difficult, you know, a very hard year,' he said.

The rocker said he had received 'a lot of support' from friends and family in the wake of the tragedy, adding: 'I appreciate that.'

He had been in a relationship with Miss Scott for 13 years. She was a red carpet favourite, with her dresses worn by Hollywood stars including Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz.

But she reportedly owed nearly £4.6 million to creditors at the time of her death.

In a statement shortly after her death, he wrote: 'I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.

'We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.'

At the weekend the Rolling Stones were forced to cancel a performance in Melbourne, during their latest tour which includes a number of dates rescheduled after Miss Scott's death.

The tour's promoter said Mr Jagger was 'under strict doctor's orders to rest his vocal cords for the next few days in order to recuperate for the remainder of the tour'.
