U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called on the international community to form a coalition to stop the 'cancer of ISIS from spreading' in an opinion piece for The New York Times.

Kerry described the Islamic group, which has become notorious for beheadings and terror campaigns in the Middle East a ‘unifying threat to a broad array of countries’ and he wants to confront it.

His article comes just days after President Obama faced a backlash over comments he made suggesting that he ‘did not have a strategy’ to deal with the threat of ISIS in Syria.

Coalition: U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry has called ISIS, 'a cancer that must be stamped out,' in an opinion piece written for The New York Times

ISIS, also known as The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has forcibly and violently grabbed territory across northern Iraq over the summer.

The Obama administration is said to be considering its next move and may consider expanding U.S. airstrikes.

U.S. airstrikes against ISIS fighters have already slowed their advance.

However, Kerry now appears to be keen to get the international community more involved.

Airstrikes: 'Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world,' Kerry wrote

He said that any further action would require the aid of America’s international allies.

Kerry
 wrote: ‘With a united response led by the United States and the 
broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be 
allowed to spread to other countries.

‘The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent.’

‘Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world,’ Kerry wrote.

In an accompanying piece written for The New York Times by Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both want President Obama to take military action to stamp out the terror group’s growing threat.

The senators urged the President to act immediately.

They warned him against ‘Doing too little to combat ISIS’ which they see as a problem. And wrote: ‘Doing less is certainly not the answer now.’

group’s growing threat

McCain and Graham suggested that the next move must include a squeezing of ISIS financing.

They are also calling for the Iraqi government to include Iraqi Sunnis, rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups.

‘Ultimately, ISIS is a military force, and it must be confronted militarily,’ the senators wrote.

But the Government has yet to decide what measures it will take.

Senators Mccain and Graham used the piece to criticise the President’s airstrikes saying that ‘they have been tactical and reactive half-measures.’

They wrote: ‘Continuing to confront ISIS in Iraq, but not in Syria, would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back. We need a military plan to defeat ISIS, wherever it is.’

However, the Secretary of State has echoed the remarks made by the President and Press Secretary Josh Earnest who have both called for an international coalition to fight ISIS.

Kerry, along with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel are expected to begin laying the groundwork for talks over a coalition next week.

Kerry will meet with European allies at the NATO meeting in Wales next week and then fly to the Middle East in an attempt to drum up further support from the region.
