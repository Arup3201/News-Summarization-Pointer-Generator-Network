A college football player and his step-father died
heroically saving his mother’s life during a home invasion.

Arkansas State University star defensive lineman Markel
Owens, 21, and stepfather Johnny Shivers, 36, were both shot dead Wednesday
night during a botched robbery at their Jackson, Tennessee home.

Mother Chermaine Owens, 37, was shot in the leg but is
expected to recover from her injuries, according to the Jackson Sun.

Police say two masked, armed men barged into the home as Mr
Shivers arrived, demanding money and drawing guns.

Both Mr Owens and Mr Shivers were shot dead as they fought
off the robbers – likely saving the life of Ms Owens, cops said.

The robbers ran off with ‘a large amount of money,’
according to KAIT. Police also discovered significant amount of marijuana
inside the home, sources told the Sun.

Authorities are operating under the assumption the thugs
knew about both money and drugs being stashed in the home, but are hailing Mr
Owens as a hero.

Pro dreams: Mr Owens planned to declare next year for the NFL Draft

‘I believe he intervened because he saw his step-father,’ a
Jackson Police Department spokesperson told KAIT. ‘He witnessed him get shot
and he was protecting him and his mother. I think that it was heroic and it
cost him his life, unfortunately.’

Police were called to the scene after Ms Owens staggered
outside screaming ‘My husband and son have been shot, someone go help them,’ a
neighbour told the Sun.

‘I just don’t know why this would happen to this family,’
the neighbor added. ‘They were such a good family.’

Police have yet to name any suspects and are actively searching the crime scene for further clues.

Mr Owens was on winter break from ASU and set to return in
only days.

A different ending: Instead of declaring for the NFL Draft, Mr Owens life ended when bullets flew through his mother's Jackson, TN apartment

Large response: Polie closed off the whole block while investigating the double murder

‘Our worst fears were realized as an athletics department
after being notified early this morning about the unfortunate news about
Markel,’ athletic director Terry Mohair said in a statement.

‘We're deeply saddened, and our utmost sympathies go out to
his family, teammates and classmates,’ he added. ‘Please join me in prayer for
so many people who are being impacted by the loss of Markel.’

Coach Blake Anderson echoed those comments, saying that
‘Markel was a part of our Red Wolves family, and it is obvious he was a
well-liked and respected member of our team who will be missed.’

The Red Wolves had just completed a successful season,
winning their second-straight GoDaddy Bowl.

Mr Owens played in 11 games during the 2013 campaign and was
set to be a starter for the 2014 season, according to reports.

Teammates lamented over the loss of the rising star.

‘We had a bond like none other, I love him, and that will
never be forgotten,’ Darius Dunaway told Arkansas Matters. ‘Everybody, I mean
everybody just liked him and right now, what you are telling me, he's a hero.’

‘He could uplift your spirit, he was just one of those who
never dwelled on anything, he was a humble individual,’ Devin Wilson told WBBJ.

Another teammate dedicated the upcoming season in his
memory.

‘A team with something to play for can be dangerous, a team
with someone to play for will be unstoppable... RIP Markel Owens,’ Kegan
McDaniel wrote on Twitter.

The 2014 season would have been his senior year, he had
plans to declare for the NFL Draft.
