One of the women who killed for Charles Manson has given her first on-camera interview about why she felt compelled to murder innocent people. 

Patricia Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and  'wanted to feel loved'. 

Krenwinkel was convicted along with Manson and two other female followers in seven 1969 murders, considered among the most notorious crimes of the 20th Century.

But the grey-haired inmate, one of Manson's two surviving female followers, claims it was her Los Angeles childhood 'in a house where silence was golden by my parents' that led her to fall so easily under Manson's deadly trance.

Patricia Krenwinkel, (seen left in 1969 and right now) who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and 'wanted to feel loved'

'My older sister was deemed incorrigible by the time she was four or five, because she was a half sister and she ended up getting into drugs and she had a child by fifteen, she says in a documentary produced by Olivia Klaus and published on the New York Times. 

'As I started to go to school I never felt like I had fitted in, I never had that sense of belonging,' says the 67-year-old.

Krenwinkel, who is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system, says after her parents' divorce she moved into with her sister in Manhattan beach.

Aged 20, she met Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967 along with Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner

'I stared losing contact with friends and I dropped out of college and I went to live with my sister.

'I was starting to drink and using has hand marijuana and whatever my sister had around. I was killing for a way out. I found myself thinking there has to be more. 

'I never ever developed a sense of who I was and where I was going and what I wanted to do. 

But aged 20, she met Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967 along with fellow followers Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner. 

'I wanted to please, I wanted to love, I wanted for the first time to feel safe. I wanted to feel like someone was going to care for me because I hadn't felt that from anywhere else in my life,' she says.

'And in giving up and moving on with Manson was just basically throwing away the rest of my life.'   

On August 8, 1969 Manson and his 'Family' slaughtered Sharon Tate, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, eight and a half months pregnant, and three of her friends at her home above Beverly Hills

Two years later on August 8, 1969 Manson and his 'Family' slaughtered Sharon Tate, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, eight and a half months pregnant, and three of her friends at her home above Beverly Hills.

Stephen Parent was a fifth victim that night - he had driven to the property to see if caretaker William Garreston wanted to buy his AM/FM Clock radio and had stayed on for a beer at the guest house. 

He was shot multiple times when he wound down the window at the electric gate as he left.

The following night they butchered small business owners Leno and Rosemary La Bianca, in their home in Los Angeles.

Krenwinkel then wrote 'DEATH TO PIGS' in blood on the wall. 

Krenwinkel was 22 when she was arrested in Mobile, Alabama, by then-Mobile police officers Billy McKeller and Sam McLarty in December 1969.

She admitted during her trial that she chased down and stabbed heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and participated in the stabbing deaths of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night, 

She was convicted along with Manson, Van Houten and Atkins. 

Another defendant, Charles 'Tex' Watson was convicted in a separate trial.

All were sentenced to death but their sentences were commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court briefly outlawed the death penalty in 1972. 

'At 23 I ended up on death row, I was in a cell 23 hours a day,' she recounts in the documentary. 

'And I think It was at the point more than ever, all of a sudden having been on death row, and away from any influence of him that I was going to have to make the decision of my life and I would have to say that everything I had ever believed was now wrong. 

'To do that was going to be the most difficult thing I had ever done because I would now have to be fully responsible for the damage, the wreckage and the horror. 

'It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of and it all comes from such a simple thing as just wanting to be loved. 

'The saddest part is my definition of love is totally skewed. 

'Today I am who I choose to be. I take responsibility every day for every word I say, what I believe, what I do, I am who I am today.

'I learned choice at the most horrific cost.'

Susan Denise Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie van Houten smile during their trial  

Krenwinkel has had parole denied several times. 

In her 40 years at the California Institution for Women, she has earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self help programs as well as teaching illiterate prisoners how to read. In recent years, she has been involved in a program to train service dogs for the disabled.

She has had a discipline-free record in prison.

None of those convicted has ever been paroled and one of them, Susan Atkins, died in prison last year after being denied compassionate release when she was terminally ill with cancer.
