A Dutch meat trader suspected of playing a key role in the Findus horsemeat scandal has denied duping customers by selling tainted beef.

Jan Fasen, who has been dubbed ‘Flash Harry’ by his neighbours, yesterday insisted his consignment of horsemeat from two Romanian abattoirs was clearly labelled when it was sold to French food processors.

His regular customers include French company Spanghero, which supplied the company making beef lasagne for Findus in Britain that was found to contain horsemeat.

‘I bought Romanian horsemeat, that’s true,’ said Fasen. ‘But that is what I sold to customers. It was clearly labelled, so I can’t be blamed for any later problem.’

However, in January last year, Fasen was convicted of deliberately marketing South American horsemeat as halal-slaughtered Dutch beef and falsifying documents. He was alleged to have made £3.5 million from the fraud.

Rogier Horchner, Fasen’s lawyer in the Dutch town of Breda, said his client had appealed against his conviction and so had yet to serve his  one-year jail sentence.

Despite his conviction, Fasen’s company Draap – spelled backwards, it’s the Dutch word for horse – continued to trade in horsemeat and used the same cold-storage warehouse in Breda as part of his business with Spanghero.

Jeffrey Grootenboer, manager of the Nemijtek cold-store warehouse, said all Fasen’s meat was clearly labelled. ‘It arrives to us as horsemeat and leaves us as horsemeat.’ According to a former colleague who spoke to him when the scandal erupted, Fasen said he was astonished to be the focus of inquiries.

‘He said, “Do you think I’d be dumb enough to get involved in something like this after all I’ve been through?” ’ said the friend.

Fasen, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, may deal in the increasingly murky world of  the trans-European horsemeat trade, but his lifestyle is anything but grimy.

He lives in considerable comfort in a £2.5 million gated mansion in Schoten, a suburb  of the Belgian city of Antwerp.  A neighbour said Fasen was often seen driving luxury cars.

He is believed to have set up his two children, Dave and Jennifer, in business. Their mother, Marion van Hoeckel, is thought to have separated from Fasen some years ago.

Dutch raid Factory linked to British Burgers

Dutch investigators were yesterday carrying out  tests after raiding a meat factory in southern Holland suspected of mixing horseflesh with beef.

They want to know whether horsemeat from the Willy Selten plant in  Oss was sold for human consumption as beef that may have been used in British burgers, pies and ready-meals.

The country’s food safety authority said it suspected the plant of buying horseflesh from Ireland and mixing it with shredded beef before passing it off as 100 per cent beef.

‘That’s the theory,’ said Willy Selten’s lawyer Frank Peters yesterday. ‘But the investigation is ongoing.’

The Dutch public prosecutor said the probe into Willy Selten, which employs about 100 staff at its beef butchery plant, also covered fraud and money laundering allegations.

No arrests were made in Friday’s raid, which underlined Holland’s role as a key distribution hub in the trade in horseflesh for the human food chain.

But finally there's some good news about the horse meat scandal!

A Mail on Sunday investigation has found 28 meat products on sale in supermarkets and corner shops across the country to be free of horsemeat.

DNA tests were carried out by Worcestershire Scientific Services, one of seven UK official control laboratories.

Our shopping basket of goods – many from cheap or frozen ranges – also included chicken, lamb and  pork items, to see if horse was being substituted for other  meats besides beef.

Baby foods,  celebrity-endorsed ready-meals, a cinema hot dog and a high street sandwich meal were also tested.

The clean bill of health appears to tally with the first test results from the Food Standards Agency announced on Friday.

Then there were just 29 instances where more than one per cent of horse DNA was found in 1,929 processed beef meals, and no evidence of any horse at all in 392 tests on raw beef samples.
