They lost the tie but they won the right to believe they can hold their own at this level once again. On a pulsating night at Pittodrie, a stirring Aberdeen display briefly threatened to bring the impossible into view.

Three goals down in the tie before the half-hour mark had been reached, Derek McInnes’ side could easily have gone searching for the nearest black hole in which to crawl into. Plenty of Scottish sides have done so in such circumstances down the years.

This Dons’ side is made of far sterner stuff, however. And when Peter Pawlett and Mark Reynolds scored either side of the break, Willie Miller’s assessment that turning the tie around would be the club’s greatest European triumph came to mind. 

Dejected: Aberdeen trudge off at Pittodrie after losing 5-2 on aggregate to Real Sociedad

Consoling hand: Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes puts an arm round midfielder Willo Flood after the game

Goal: Xabi Prieto (2), Bergara.

They gave it their all and then some more against a side that wheel and deal at levels Scottish teams can only dream of. But the goal that would have presented the grandstand finish to beat them all just never materialised.

Two late, late Sociedad goals to defeat the Scots on the night were wounding and frankly undeserved on the balance of play.

The Dons go out but the ovation they received at the game’s conclusion said it all. From SPL driftwood two years ago to bloodying Real Sociedad’s noses. There is much to buoy the men from the Granite City as the domestic season begins.

Aberdeen had spent a week stewing over a failure to do themselves justice in San Sebastian and within four minutes, they’d subjected the Basques to a more stringent examination.

Pawlett, a peripheral figure in Spain, outpaced Ruben Pardo to win a free-kick on the left. Niall McGinn’s disguised set play picked out Jonny Hayes lurking just inside the box only for the Irishman to fluff his lines horribly with a fresh-air strike. It at least succeeded in bringing the red hordes to their feet.

A promising start was almost undone by Willo Flood’s misjudgement inside his own box on 10 minutes. Perhaps blinded by the sun, he rolled his pass-back directly to Alfred Finnbogason. Only Reynolds’ positioning on the six-yard line to block the Icelander’s shot kept the tie alive.

Double trouble: Xabi Prieto scored twice for the Spanish side as they won 3-2 in Scotland

The movement of the Dons’ attacking quartet – which contained David Goodwillie rather than Adam Rooney – troubled the men from La Liga all night.

When McGinn beautifully brought down a long diagonal while playing on the shoulder of his opponent, his delicate chip was just inches over Enaut Zubikarai’s bar.

The Dons had the ball in the net soon after when Ryan Jack slammed home from Andy Considine’s header but the linesman’s offside flag correctly cut the celebrations short.

Vigilance at the back was imperative to keep the tie alive, though, and McInnes was thankful for Shay Logan’s bravery to rob Finnbogason whilst defending a counter attack one-on-one on the edge of his own box.

Real skipper Pardo saw yellow for abruptly halting Flood’s burst through the centre. Yet from Real’s perspective, it was a price worth paying as they effectively put the tie beyond the Dons on 28 minutes.

After such a heroic start to the game, it was a brutally simple goal to lose. Pardo simply guided an out-swinging corner on to the six-yard box where Prieto was lurking at the near post. One flex of the neck muscles sent his header flashing beyond the helpless Langfield. Three up in the tie, the job was as good as done.

Commendably, there was no question of the Scots folding. Russell Anderson seemed to jump half his height to claim McGinn’s corner but, alas, Reynolds was a yard shy of converting as the ball arrowed back across goal.

Still they believed. Logan rattled a 25-yarder down Zubikarai’s throat then, one minute from the break, came the goal their efforts so richly deserved.

Gathering the ball on the penalty spot, Goodwillie juggled it from left foot to right then left again. Finally, he pulled the trigger only for the out-stretched leg of Inigo Martinez to block. Pawlett reacted faster than anyone in blue and white and smashed the ball low into the net.

On the stroke of half-time, Langfield’s block with his legs to deny Finnbogason ensured the Dons were still in it as they made it to the sanctuary dressing room.

They were in the Basques’ faces from the re-start although Hayes lunge on Alberto de la Bella came at the cost of a booking.

Still the Red tide surged forward. And with fully 33 minutes still on the watch came the goal that rocked Pittodrie.

Hayes’ corner was claimed by the towering Anderson. McGinn gathered and made for the bye-line, pitching a gem of a ball to the back post where Reynolds applied a sumptuous headed finish.

Rooney and Nicky Low were called from the bench as Mcinnes sought a more direct approach but neither the break of the ball or the moment of magic they craved to put themselves within a goal of victory arrived.

Substitute Sergio Canales arced a curling effort inches wide of Langfield’s goal then missed a pinch from eight yards to ensure the Dons kept believing.

Ash Taylor was pitched in an emergency centre forward with seven minutes left but the Dons couldn’t hold back time.

They were robbed of a deserved win on the night when Logan caught De la Bella inside the box with five minutes remaining and Prieto calmly chipped home from the spot.

To add insult to injury, Markel Bergera rose to thump home a header from six yards in stoppage time.

It was as brave an effort as you could wish to see from a Scottish side but unfortunately not quite enough.
