The father of an 11-year-old girl, who has not been seen since Saturday night, has made a heartfelt plea to his daughter to return home to her family.

After an argument with a family member, Michelle Levy, wearing a party dress, left her home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm.

'Please come home, we all miss you, we love you, we just want you to be safe,' Michelle's father Adam Levy said speaking to Nine News on Sunday.

Adam Levy has pleaded with his daughter to come home, saying she is in no trouble but is greatly missed by the family

'You're not in trouble ... just please come home as soon as possible everyone's very worried,' he pleaded. 

Following reports Michelle was spotted at Centennial Park on Saturday evening - about 4.5 kilometres or an hour walk from her home - the site was scoured all day Sunday.

A police helicopter was hovering above the park on Sunday afternoon and police officers were looking in the bushes for the young girl. 

SES volunteers will finalise their search on Sunday evening and are expected to return to looking for Michelle in Bondi, a NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 

Jewish medical emergency response organisation Hatzolah have dozens of volunteers on the ground on Sunday night searching for missing Michelle.

A spokeswoman confirmed there are teams of people walking the streets, speaking to people and knocking on doors in the hope of locating the girl.

She also said they have set up headquarters on Flood Street in Bondi and are allocating search areas to groups of people wanting to help the search.

Earlier on Sunday Mr Levy told Daily Mail Australia: 'Its been very challenging and heart-wrenching,' 

'We all love her and everyone is worried about her - she doesn't need to worry about being in trouble.' 

Michelle was last seen leaving the family home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm on Saturday, and was reportedly seen at Centennial Park later that evening

Mr Levy said although she had run off to her grandparent's house nearby a few times, the disappearance was out-of-character.

'She doesn't usually go further than the front wall,' he said. 'We assumed if she wasn't within the block that she was at her grandparents.'

He described his daughter as a very intelligent child who often displayed stubborn traits.

'She's very bookish - she's a real book worm but that doesn't mean she doesn't do other things,' he said.  

He told Daily Mail Australia that he hoped Michelle was hiding out somewhere that the family were unaware of. 

Michelle had an argument with a family member before leaving the family home in North Bondi

Michelle had left the home on previous occasions but had always gone to another family member's house which she has not done on this particular occasion 

Despite extensive searches of the area including CCTV footage from local businesses, SES workers scouring the North Bondi cliffs, police officers door knocking and speaking to her school and friends, she hasn’t been found. 

Michelle is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 150cm tall, with a thin build. 

She has long red hair, blue eyes and freckles.

At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a white party dress with black, orange and yellow flowers and a black sash.

Police and family are concerned for Michelle’s welfare due to her age and are urging anyone with information on her whereabouts to come forward.
