Wealthy buyers have snapped up almost all the luxury 220 apartments in a $250 million steel and glass development block in Sydney on the same day they went on sale.

The homes including four penthouses, which will not be complete until December 2017, went on the market in Sydney, Jakarta and Singapore on Saturday.

The Crown Group developer revealed that 95 per cent of the one, two and three-bedroom apartments were sold within four hours and that the 27th floor penthouses sold out within one hour.

A total of $173.1 million in apartments at the 161 Clarence Street building in Sydney were purchased, with the prices of apartments sold starting from $826,650 for a one-bedroom suite.

Residents at the luxury block can enjoy a rooftop entertainment area looking over Darling Harbour, an indoor swimming pool, fully equipped gym and the convenience of shops and restaurants on the ground level of the tower.

Anyone wanting to snap up one – or a bunch – of the apartments with panoramic views had to pre-register and then sign contracts.

Over 500 people turned out to the Sydney office for the launch in Sydney alone.

The 27-storey building will be constructed in the heart of Sydney city centre.

Crown Group Chief Executive Officer Iwan Sunito said the success of the Sydney by Crown launch was reflective of a growing demand for high-end property in Sydney and a record result for the company.

Sydney by Crown is the only new apartment building in the CBD to launch before the end of 2014.

'The launch of Sydney by Crown is the strongest launch day result in Crown Group's history,' Mr Sunito said.

'Sydney by Crown is set to become one of Sydney's architectural centrepieces, a globally recognised icon, designed in Sydney, for Sydneysiders. Sydney by Crown has captured the attention of the world.

'We received thousands of enquiries from around the world prior to launch and today's result reflects the strong appetite for high-quality apartments built by developers with a good track record in Sydney,' he said. 

'Many of our buyers on Saturday were past purchasers of Crown Group apartments, a testament to our reputation and quality of our developments,' Mr Sunito added.  

The Sydney-based architect who designed the Sydney by Crown tower, Koichi Takada, is also the man behind a plan for a new apartment block in Sydney's Green Square, 4km south of the city centre.

As part of the 280 hectare Green Square redevelopment area, the architecture firm has proposed plans for 416 luxury apartments and 5,000sqm of retail and restaurant space.

Koichi is said to mix the traditions of his Japanese homeland with 'flowing forms'.

And the success of Sydney by Crown comes after the launch of Crown Group's Skye by Crown in North Sydney last year, when more than 110 apartments worth more than $100 million were sold within a week.
