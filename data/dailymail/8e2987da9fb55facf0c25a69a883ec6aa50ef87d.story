A 21-year-old who shot a man with significant learning difficulties while trying to steal his $300 Beats headphones has been jailed for life without parole.

Arkel Garcia approached Christian Massey in an alleyway in Wynnefield, west Philadelphia, on November 30, 2013.

He shot Mr Massey, also 21, twice in the attempted robbery before leaving him to be discovered by police.

Mr Massey told officers before he lost consciousness that he thought he was being robbed. 

He died an hour later at the Hospital of Pennsylvania having owned the headphones for less than a day. 

Garcia was convicted of second degree murder, robbery and weapons offenses on February 17. 

But sentencing was delayed after a verbal altercation between Garcia and a sheriff's deputy turned violent.

Garcia, 21, was trying to steal Mr Massey's $300 Beats by Dre headphones which he had owned for less than a day

Prosecutors at the Criminal Justice Center said Garcia told detectives in December 2013 that he and two men planned to rob Mr Massey but had no idea he would be killed, the Delaware County Daily Times reported. 

Brendan O’Malley, Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney, said: 'Garcia didn’t even get the proceeds of the robbery.

'He didn’t even get what he came there for. He took Chris’s life and left the headphones on the ground.'

Garcia's lawyer argued he had nothing to do with the crimes.
