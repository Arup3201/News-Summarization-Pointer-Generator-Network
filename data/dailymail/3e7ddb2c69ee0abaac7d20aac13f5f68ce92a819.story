A bride-to-be who suffered a devastating illness which left her paralysed learned to use her legs again in just four months.

Belinda Johnson says she achieved this feat because she was so determined to walk down the aisle at her wedding.

The 54-year-old experienced excruciating back pain and lost feeling in her buttocks and legs after an abscess on her spine suddenly burst, spreading poison throughout her body.

Despite the catastrophic damage, Mrs Johnson was so determined to be standing when she gave her vows to her fiancé Alan, 50, that she learned to walk again in just 16 weeks.

She said: ‘I was in tears as I managed to walk down the aisle, holding my bouquet, supported by my son Mark. It was an incredibly emotional moment.

‘Hanging on to Alan, I managed to stand as I made my vows. I promised him that I would always keep the magic alive between us.’

As their wedding day approached, Mr and Mrs Johnson were travelling in their car when their lives suddenly changed forever.

Mrs Johnson said: ‘A car in front of us turned sharply, forcing Alan to brake. I was slightly jolted in my seat.

‘The next day, my back was killing me. I thought I’d pulled a muscle.’

Despite having lost the feeling in her legs just months earlier, Mrs Johnson was able to dance with her husband on their wedding day

But then, three days later, Mrs Johnson, of Southport started to experience mysterious pins and needles in her lower body.

She said: ‘My legs and bottom went numb overnight and, upsettingly, I found I couldn’t control my bladder at all.

‘By mid-morning I was in agony, and we had to call an ambulance. I was gasping into the oxygen mask because the pain was so bad. I had lost feeling but experiencing something like pins and needles, but 100 times worse.’

She was taken to Southport Hospital where doctors first suspected she was suffering from a blood clot.

Despite her dramatic recovery, Mrs Johnson still suffers weakness in her legs and has limited bladder control

When the abscess burst it filled Mrs Johnson's body with poison meaning she was in agonising pain and had to be given strong antibiotics

She was transferred to the Walton Centre in Liverpool for exploratory surgery that evening, when it was determined that the jolt in the car had burst an undiscovered abscess in her lower spine, spreading pus throughout her back and lower body.

She said: ‘I was delirious and screaming at the doctors, begging them to chop my legs off because the pain was so bad.

‘Poison from the abscess was attacking my body and killing my nerves. I was put on intravenous antibiotics because there was a lot of poison in my blood.

‘I was scared, but Alan was terrified.’

Mrs Johnson says when she first fell ill she told her husband-to-be to leave her so he didn't have to care for her

After a month in hospital Mrs Johnson was able to return home in a wheelchair, having been warned that much of the damage was irreversible.

While the pins and needles had subsided, numbness had spread across her buttocks and legs, and she experienced stabbing pains. Her legs felt too heavy to move.

Devastated, she considered freeing Alan from his responsibility of care.

She said: ‘We had big plans for our wedding. We had day-dreamed of an ice hotel or a cruise before settling on a nice local hotel which all our friends and family could get to.

‘But now I couldn’t use my legs at all, and I couldn’t control my bladder. All I saw when I looked in the mirror was a complete mess. I told Alan I didn’t expect him to have to cope.

‘I reassured him that my family would be able to look after me and asked him to walk away.

‘Alan wouldn’t hear a minute of it. He told me he would always be there to look after me and he wasn’t going anywhere.

‘There were tears and lots of hugging. It was such a relief to hear that Alan would stay by my side. He’s done so much to get me through.’

Mrs Johnson, supported by Alan, a farm manager, her daughter Heather, 22, son Mark, 26, and Alan’s daughter Georgia, 18, and son Connor, 16, began an intensive course of physiotherapy.

She said: ‘I began by simply moving over to the side of the bed. Then, slowly, I tried standing. I was so wobbly because I couldn’t feel my legs. They were strangely heavy. It was a very weird feeling.

‘The physiotherapists give me a Zimmer frame, but after two steps I was exhausted. Every day they tried to push me a little bit more.

Mrs Johnson said: 'My whole life has completely changed and I had to go through a grieving process before I came to terms with that. I had to face the fact I couldn't work anymore'

‘I knew I had the wedding coming up, and that gave me the determination to keep going.’

Finally, on November 11, 2011, Mrs Johnson was able to walk to Alan as he waited at the altar.

She said: ‘Heather sang a song called The Promise which we’d first heard when Alan proposed at Disneyland. Considering what we’d been through, the song was perfect.

‘We chose Love of My Life by The Dooleys for our first dance. It’s quite a fast song. It wasn’t until the DJ announced that the song was coming on that I realised I should have chosen a slower ballad instead - something which would have been easier to sway to.

‘We still managed to dance for a few seconds before Heather brought everyone onto the floor to join us.’

Mrs Johnson said: 'Me and Alan are so happy together. He has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible. Now, I'm not bothered by it. I just get on with life'

Mrs Johnson, who has been diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome, is no longer in physiotherapy and has come to terms with the fact that she will never gain full control over her lower body.

Cauda equina syndrome is caused by compression of the nerves in the spine and results in bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, loss of sensation and weakness in the legs.

She said: ‘I try and walk a little bit each day to prevent muscle wastage. The lack of bowel and bladder control isn’t brilliant but I have systems in place to help me manage. I have a little bit more control back. 

‘My whole life has completely changed and I had to go through a grieving process before I came to terms with that. I had to face the fact I couldn’t work anymore.

‘Me and Alan are so happy together. He has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible.

‘Now, I’m not bothered by it. I just get on with life.’
