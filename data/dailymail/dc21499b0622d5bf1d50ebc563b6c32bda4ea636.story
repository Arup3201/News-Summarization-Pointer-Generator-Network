A FedEx worker spotted in Midtown Manhattan this week might want to consider trying out for the Olympics.

A driver for the eponymous shipping company was spotted Wednesday throwing packages into her truck like shot put balls. She even appeared to give lessons in proper throwing etiquette to another person who wanted in on the package tossing fun.

The two can even be seen laughing at one point in the video uploaded to YouTube.

Busted: A FedEx worker was filmed Wednesdaythrowing packages into the back of a FedEx truck in Midtown Manhattan

The FedEx employee is initially seen throwing stacks of shipping boxes into the truck while her cohort appears to be keeping her makeshift shotputs in a neat stack to her right.

The video, according to its description, was taken around 6:15pm Wednesday night

Not content to let her have all the fun, the man - not in a FedEx uniform - appears about to chuck a stack of boxes into the truck before putting them down.

After what looks like a quick lesson in maximizing FedEx package distance from a box throwing pro, the man tries again to heave a stack of boxes into the truck before they are taken from his hand and promptly thrown into the back wall of the truck - eliciting a satisfied grin from the FedEx worker.

No look pass: The FedEx worker doesn't even stop to admire her handiwork before moving onto the next stack of victims

Hilarious: The dynamic duo revels in how funny it is throwing other people's things into the back of a truck

Armed with two solid lessons in box throwing technique, the man hurls a smaller box intop the roof of the truck with the FedEx worker giving her cackle of approval.

The dynamic duo takes turns throwing the remainder of the boxes into the truck, as if competing against each other, before finally running out of boxes.

'We are very disappointed to see this. FedEx sets high standards of behavior and performance for our team members and this behavior falls far short of what is expected,' a FedEx spokesperson told Gothamist, adding that the driver's manager has been contacted and the 'appropriate corrective action will be taken.'
