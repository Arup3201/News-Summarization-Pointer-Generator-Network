A fire alarm test gone awry left a fleet of Black Hawk military choppers buried in fire suppression foam at an Oklahoma base Tuesday.

An outside contractor at the Oklahoma Army National Guard base was testing the safety system when the foam was accidentally triggered.

The result was a hangar brimming with the frothy white chemical and and ten high tech helicopters looking like a freak summer snow storm had blown through Tulsa. 

Buried: A fleet of military Black Hawk helicopters was buried in foam Tuesday morning when someone accidentally set off a fire suppression system

Foamy: Ten of the choppers in total were buried at the Oklahoma Army National Guard base in Tulsa 

Blizzard: Some cyclonic winds even caused a brief 'foam devil'

Pilot Will Kavanagh told News 9 that, at least for most of the affected helicopters, the foam acted mostly like a bath for the aircraft.

Seven of them were outside the hangar, where pictures show foam had poured from inside where the system was triggered.

Those Black Hawks, however, had their cockpits closed and were completely untouched save for their sturdy exteriors.

Inside, however, three more choppers were parked with their doors ajar. Officials told News 9 that those did require some maintenance.

In spite of initial fears that the aircraft would be out of commission for weeks, officials said they were all back in working order by Tuesday afternoon. 

All set to fly: Mechanics feared the three Black Hawks that were inside the hangar would be inoperable for weeks, but a check soon revealed they were good to go by Tuesday evening

Like a bath: The helicopters parked outside the hangar were completely undamaged
