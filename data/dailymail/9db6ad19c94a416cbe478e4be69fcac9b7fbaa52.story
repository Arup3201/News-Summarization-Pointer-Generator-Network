A popular Manhattan restaurant often frequented by celebs is being investigated by the Department of Health after a pregnant woman contracted a food-borne illness after eating there, according to published reports.

Freeman's restaurant, a popular Lower East Side restaurant described as 'a trendy hunting lodge-inspired brunch place,' has been investigated for an outbreak of a norovirus that causes vomiting an diarrhea, a Department of Health spokesman told the New York Post.

The restaurant currently holds an 'A' ranking from the Department of Health, the highest rank possible for adhering to city health codes.

The scare has forced Health officials to ask restaurant employees to provide stool samples to prove that they do not have the virus.

The restaurant says Health officials already have cleared the employees of any sign of the virus.

'The Dept of Health did look into this at Freemans and have concluded 
their findings and ended their investigation and found no link or 
transmission of any kind at the restaurant,' restaurant spokesman Eden 
Grimaldi told the Post.

The dangerous disease is contracted through feces and spread by person-to-person contact.

About 20 million people are infected with the disease each year.

'They came and checked everything yesterday…They tested everyone… [They 
took] stool samples,' a worker told The Post.

The restaurant is frequented by celebrities like the Olsen twins and others who live or spend time in lower Manhattan.

The restaurant's loyal patrons were quick to defend the popular brunch spot, telling the paper that just because the restaurant is being investigated doesn't mean there is necessarily a problem.

The restaurant maintains that the Health Department found no problems after conducting its investigation.

'Freemans remains open, with an A rating,' Grimaldi added.
