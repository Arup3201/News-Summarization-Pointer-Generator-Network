Arrested: John Michael Dodrill was arrested on suspicion of pulling a gun on a seven-year-old girl scout

A girl scout selling cookies was left traumatised after a customer pulled a gun as he opened the door.

The seven-year-old and her father were fundraising on Strawberry Tree Lane in Temecula, California, with a tin of baked goods on Sunday morning.

But at 11.30am she knocked on a door and was met with a deadly weapon.

The pair scarpered, horrified, and called the police.

John Michael Dodrill, 59, has been arrested and charged with the offence, and is due to appear in court tomorrow.

Online jail records reveal Dodrill had been in custody less than two hours before the girl arrived on his doorstep.

Her father, who witnessed the alleged offence, called the police.

Two handguns and two rifles have been seized from Dodrill's home, reports claim.

The girl is a member of the San Gorgonio Girl Scouts, which will join its sister groups in celebrating National Girl Scout Cookie Day this weekend.

The sale of Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, and other favorites bring in $790 million each year.

The trade is also touted as a way to give young girls invaluable life experiences, and to teach them about the values of business ethics and people skills.

Girls are encouraged to get out and 'spread the word' to potential customers this Friday and Saturday.

Scouts spokesman Jua-Nita Houston said the girl was shaken by the incident but would not be deterred from fundraising.

Ms Houston said: 'She set very strong goals for herself, and sheâ€™s going to meet those goals.'
