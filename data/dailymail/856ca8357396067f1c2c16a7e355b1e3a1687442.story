Police and RSPCA inspectors have rescued a dog subjected to 'horrible' abuse after being hog-tied in a park.

Officers found the boxer-cross - which they have called Spencer - abandoned in Sloughbottom Park in Norwich.

His legs were lashed together and he had been tied to a post, leaving him unable to stand or move. He also had string and household electrical cable wrapped around his neck.

Cruel: The animal's legs were secured using electrical cables and string 

Spencer, believed to be about four years old, was relatively healthy but in pain from being tied up.

The dog was spotted by a member of the public near a skate park at about 6am on Saturday.

Officers looked after the frightened dog at the scene and helped by a vet were quickly able to move him safely to start receiving treatment.

Spencer was not micro-chipped and did not have any identification tags.

RSPCA inspector Laura Sayer said: 'Poor Spencer was traumatised from this horrible ordeal but luckily not hurt.

'He is a lovely dog, and has clearly been well looked after, so it might even be that there is a loving owner out there missing him.

'We urge anyone with any information to come forward.'

Care: Police officers wrapped the suffering animal in a foil blanket and their coats after rescuing it 

She added: 'We are very grateful to this passing member of the public and to the police for rescuing him, there is no way he would have been able to escape the tangle of ropes which held him on his own - apparently he was completely hog-tied.

'We can’t imagine who would do such a terrible thing to a beautiful pet.'

Pc Craig Bidwell said: 'Attacking a dog in this way is completely unacceptable and I would urge anyone who has information about the incident to contact me.

'Officers will be working with inspectors from the RSPCA to find the person responsible and take action.'

Witnesses should contact Norfolk Police or the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
