An academic is being investigated by his university after stripping off in front of shocked students in the middle of a lecture.

Dr Ian Lamond, an events management lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University, performed the striptease in an apparent bid to teach his class how to give an exciting sales pitch.

The university now says it is looking into the stunt after bemused members of Dr Lamond's class tweeted pictures of his actions.

Leeds Metropolitan University has launched an investigation after events management lecturer Dr Ian Lamond stripped down to his underwear mid-way through a lecture

Dr Lamond removed his trousers and purple shirt and stood in front of his class in just a grey pair of underpants

It is believed Dr Lamond started taking his clothes off during a lecture he was giving to first year students earlier this year.

Photos show him removing his trousers and purple shirt and standing in front of his class in just a grey pair of underpants. He was then pictured sitting down at a desk and shaving.

Stunned students went online soon after the incident, with one tweeting: 'I literally have no idea what is going on right now, why is my lecturer semi naked.. and now painting his face white..'

And another told her friend: 'Ian Lamond is stripping and shaving to try and convey a point but I really have no clue what is going on!'

A video of the incident was also placed online, which shows students chuckling in their seats as Dr Lamond marches around the front of the lecture hall in his pants, holding up his clothes.

Stunned students took to Twitter to express their shock at their lecturer's strange antics

They tweeted friends telling them what was going on during the bizarre twist to their usual lecture

The university says Dr Lamond has not been suspended but the incident is being investigating. Dr Lamond told MailOnline he would not comment until the inquiry has concluded.

Dr Lamond, 51, completed his PhD in arts and culture policy at Sheffield Hallam University in 2012 and has since studied political activism while lecturing on the Â£9,000-a-year university course.

In a recent interview with a careers website, he boasted about his '(cough) "athletic physique"'.

Telling the website about his job, he said: 'What I am really enjoying is the combination of lecturing, particularly when I'm in-front of a cohort of 200 plus events students in one of the larger lecture theatres, and research. It's that voracious curiosity and performer in me I guess.

'Unless you are passionate you cannot enthuse your students, your colleagues and, importantly, yourself.'
