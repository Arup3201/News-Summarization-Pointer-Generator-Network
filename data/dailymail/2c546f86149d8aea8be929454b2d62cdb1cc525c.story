The world's first 'sparkling' apple that fizzes in the mouth when eaten has been created.

Huge cells in the flesh of the brand new variety called Paradis Sparkling, release effervescent juices that is akin to having a mouthful of fizzy drink.

The sensation is only experienced when the apple is bitten into and its juices are not sparkling when pressed.

The new breed has taken years to perfect. One of the two varieties used to breed the new apple is called Resi, an East German specimen known for its sweet texture.

After being allowed easier access to the East German apple, a Swiss fruit nursery visited the former Soviet Bloc country to breed it with the variety Pirouette.

The experts from the family firm Lubera spent years perfecting the breed until they achieved the fizziness of the Paradis Sparkling apple.

Lubera are now selling sapling trees through mail order for £34 ($55).

Robert Maierhofer, production manager at Lubera, said: 'For an eating apple I think it is the best apple we have ever had.

'It is definitely different to any other on the market and the texture is something that people have ever eaten before.

'It has a soft texture but a heavy crunch and very big cells that open up in the mouth, releasing a lot of acidity and sugar that gives you a feeling of having a fizzy drink.

'The juice itself is not sparkling, if you press it it is still. It is just the feeling you get in your mouth.'

Mr Maierhofer said the breeding process involved repeatedly selecting the richest apples produced from a tree to cross-breed with.
