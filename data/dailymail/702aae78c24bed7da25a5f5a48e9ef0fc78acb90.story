Two Lottery players are on the verge of losing £1 million each.

The pair won the Millionaire Raffle £1 million jackpot on June 7 – but they have failed to come forward to claim  their prizes.

The winning tickets were bought in Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, and Stockport.

The ticket-holders have until today to come forward – or forfeit the prizes.

The draw in question was draw number 387.

A National Lottery spokesman said: ‘Time really is running out for these people.

‘We want players to check down the sofa and in coats as the tickets could be anywhere. The two holders are set to miss out on a fortune.’

The raffle game plays out alongside the EuroMillions game only in the UK.

The National Lottery said unclaimed prizes are common however normally either players forget to claim or more then often never actually know they have ever won in the first place.

It could have been me: Winners Dave and Angela Dawes kept their ticket safe to scoop £101,203,600.70

In this case the organisation said it could be that the two ticket holders do not even know the Millionaire Raffle exists so might have immediately discarded their tickets as soon as the main EuroMillions draw finished.

If the two ticket holders fail to come forward then the money will be added to the pot of Good Causes.

In October Dave and Angie Dawes from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire were unveiled as £101million Euromillion Lottery winners.

When the couple collected the huge payout they spoke of their plans to buy a new engagement ring to replace the £800 model Miss Dawes already has.

They also wanted a house in Chelsea for 47-year-old Mr Dawes and to buy a home in Portugal, where they plan to marry next year.
