Arsenal winger Theo Walcott cannot wait for the new season to start - and neither can his three-month old son Finley by the looks of things.

The England international has bought Finley a full Arsenal kit with 'DADDY' and his number, 14, on the back ahead of the start of the 2014/15 campaign.

Walcott is returning to fitness after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Arsenal's FA Cup third-round victory against Tottenham in January.

The England winger refused to set a date for his comeback but insists he is pleased with the progress he has made.

'The knee is going really well, I am doing some good stuff with the physios and fitness coaches and we have worked really hard throughout the summer,' Walcott said,

'Things are looking really good and I have worked very hard for the last five months now.

'The most important thing is getting the strength back and it has pretty much nearly healed - it is just about building up that stability and strength again.

'It is coming along nicely and I am really pleased.'
