She's a busy mother-of-two who runs a successful business and has a stellar acting career.

But as these campaign images attest, Jessica Alba still finds time to maintain a healthy lifestyle - and shows off the results in her new campaign.

The actress, 33, showcases her toned and tanned legs and natural beauty in the campaign imagery for the Braun Silk-épil 9 epilator.

Jessica Alba, 33, is the star of Braun's new campaign and shows off her toned  legs in the new imagery, saying the device she's plugging gives women the freedom to wear what they want with confidence

In one shot the mother-of-two shows off her long limbs wearing a chic white swimsuit and red stilettos. In another, she can be seen striking a pose wearing high-waisted white shorts and crop top teamed with a peach jacket. 

Speaking about her new role, Jessica said: 'I am a big fan of the new Braun Silk- épil 9 because it puts me in control of my beauty routine. Soft, smooth skin is my foundation for every look.

'Whether I'm wearing a dramatic gown for a premiere, a cute minidress out with my girlfriends or just hanging on the beach with my family, using it makes my skin look as good as I feel.

'It helps women express themselves in their personal style as it gives them the freedom to wear what they want with confidence.'

The model and actress also travelled to Dubai on behalf of the brand on Thursday, where she and her fashion stylists shared advice with women on how to embrace unlimited choices in their lives.  

Stylists Emily Current and Meritt Elliott, who accompanied the star, said: 'We believe women should never have to compromise on their style because they are not beauty ready. 

'As stylists we have seen first-hand how empowering it is when women no longer have to hide behind those "safe" items of clothing and are able to wear the clothes that make them feel good.

'We want to encourage women to unleash their wardrobe and wear the outfit that makes them feel fabulous every day.'

With Spring just around the corner it's time to get next season's wardrobe in check. Jessica Alba was already ahead of the game when she showed up to an event in Dubai in this smart ensemble. Decked out in a sleeveless white top, pink skirt, and a pair of strappy Gianvito Rossi mules, the Honest Company entrepreneur looked perfectly poised and polished.

You can expect to see a lot more of these slides in the upcoming months as the Spring/Summer runways were littered with them. Miu Miu's version came tied with a bow while Chloe did a color block wedge rendition. Even Stella McCartney got in on the trend with her metallic buckled shoes.

It seems that business is booming for Jessica, who on Thursday celebrated the success of her business venture, The Honest Company, which she called a 'dream come true'.

She shared a photo with her Instagram followers that shows her reveling at a bash, captioning the snap: 'We're 3yrs old! @honest! #holymoly #sohappy #dreamcometrue #pinchme #TheHonestCompany #thehonestlife'

According to Inc. magazine, The Honest Company - which makes non-toxic household products - made more than $150m (£97m) in revenue in 2014 and is reported to be worth $1b (£65m).

And now the star is launching a cosmetics range after attracting a following of consumers who are fans of the brand.

'From day one when we opened our doors, we had so many people say "when are you going to do makeup?"' she shared. 'I’ve been developing and working on it for a couple of years now, and we’re going to be able to deliver on our promise to our customers.'

And on February 12, Jessica was seen scouting a property in LA as a possible location for the first-ever The Honest Company store.

Jessica's business savvy has inspired Cash, who recently launched the sock line Pair Of Thieves, which he co-founded with two friends.
