Jordan's King Abdullah has said Syrian President Bashar Assad should step down making him the first Arab ruler to make such a call.

Jordan has been critical of Syria's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters in recent months and the king said the country's leader should initiate a political dialogue.

He told the BBC: 'I would step down and make sure whoever comes behind me has the ability to change the status quo that we're seeing.

'If Bashar has the interest of his country, he would step down, but he would also create an ability to reach out and start a new phase of Syrian political life'.

At least 40 Syrians were killed in fighting on Monday between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and insurgents in a town near the border with Jordan, local activists said, in the first case of major armed resistance to Assad in the region.   

The European Union on Monday decided to impose more sanctions on Syria to get Assad to halt his bloody crackdown on the eight-month uprising. 

The Arab League has also suspended Syria from its League membership - a move that has been hailed by the Foreign Secretary as 'strong measures'.

Mr Hague today welcomed more EU sanctions against Syria in protest at President Assad's failure to end 'horrific violence'.

He also approved the extension of European travel and financial restrictions to another 18 members of the regime's inner circle,

Seal of approval: Mr Hague has welcomed more EU sanctions against Syria in opposition to President Assad's failure to end the violence

Mr Hague said: 'President Assad has ignored countless calls by the international community to put an end to the horrific violence in Syria.

'Since the Syrian regime's claim to have agreed to the plan put forward by the Arab League on November 2, violence has only escalated with a death toll of over 3,500 people since March'.

He added: 'As long as the violence continues, we will continue to press the Syrian regime to bring an end to this killing'.

The 18 individuals added to a current list of 56 already targeted for European travel and visa bans and the freezing of any assets held in the EU have not been named.

But they include security, military and intelligence officials known to be involved in or actively supporting the regime's activities.

Mr Hague and his EU counterparts also agreed to halt loans to Syria from the European Investment Bank in a bid to further squeeze President Assad, whose country has received nearly £1.5bn from the EIB since 1978 to aid major infrastructure projects, crucially in its energy sector.

In a statement the EU foreign ministers expressed deep concern about the deteriorating situation in Syria and condemned 'the ongoing brutal repression and widespread human rights violations'.
