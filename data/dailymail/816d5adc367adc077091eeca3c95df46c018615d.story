Juan Cuadrado has been left out of the Fiorentina squad to face Real Madrid on Saturday, heightening speculation that he is set for a summer switch away from the Serie A club.

La Viola are set to face the Spanish giants in a pre-season encounter in Warsaw, but the winger will not travel to Poland following his omission.

Manchester United and Barcelona in particular are believed to be leading the chase for his signature, as the Colombian international has been linked with a host of Europe's top clubs.

And this latest development will only serve to encourage those who are hot on the heels of the 26-year-old. 

Cuadrado signed for Fiorentina in 2012, and has since played 83 games for the club and scored 20 goals in the process.

But it was his displays for Colombia at the World Cup that really brought him to the attention of Europe's top table, where he linked up with James Rodriguez to help fire the South American nation to the quarter-finals.
