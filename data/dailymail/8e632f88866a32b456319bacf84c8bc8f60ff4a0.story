Reaching more than a thousand feet into the air, The Shard was hailed as one of the wonders of the age when it was completed.

Yet Britain’s tallest building is almost entirely empty, as its owners struggle to find buyers and tenants for its offices and luxury flats.

As our picture shows, London’s  72-storey skyscraper is largely dark in the early evening, while the surrounding buildings are bright with office lights.

Almost a year after it opened at a cost of £500 million, the building’s only occupants are a restaurant on the 32nd floor and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors, which offers visitors stunning views of the capital for £25. Not a single office in the 26 floors devoted to business use has been rented.

High rents and economic stagnation have been blamed for the slow take-up – but other experts believe the problem is more fundamental: location, location, location.

The Shard is to the south of the Thames, across the river from the financial institutions of the Square Mile who would be its target tenants.

In contrast, in two other skyscrapers – nicknamed Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie – more than half the floor space has already been let, even though they are still under construction.

But these both lie in the heart of the City.

Julian Hind, an office leasing agent at estate agency Farebrother, said: ‘It’s been marketed as an iconic central London tower, priced like the City.

'For people to locate south of the river the developers are asking quite big rents.’

A 205-room five-star hotel will open in 
The Shard in the summer, but it will still leave empty almost 600,000 sq
 ft of office space on the first 28 floors.

Ten luxury flats with price tags of up to £50 million also remain unoccupied, although the building’s Qatari owners say they will not be put on sale formally until the hotel underneath them opens.

National Trust chairman Sir Simon Jenkins, who has been forthright in his criticism of the ‘egomaniacal architecture’ of The Shard, said the building was unsuitable for businesses because the offices were ‘the wrong shape’.

The former editor of The Times said: ‘It is very inefficient per square foot, because of things like lifts and so on.

'They are not a very attractive proposition. Office blocks across London are empty.

'It’s entirely speculative, you hope one day it will be filled.’

He added that few super rich inhabitants would ever end up actually living in the apartments in The Shard.

‘They are just bank accounts in the sky,’ he said. ‘Nobody wants to live in these places, they are buying them as investments.’

However, letting agent Julian Hind believes that The Shard will be ‘in a better position’ to attract businesses once surrounding development work is also finished.

Talks are currently under way that, if successful, will see at most a quarter of the space in the Shard being taken up.

But although the empty floors may be embarrassing, the building’s owners have deep pockets and are believed to be comfortable about waiting until the City economy picks up.

The building, at London Bridge station, 
was financed by the oil-rich gulf state of Qatar, which has wide 
interests in Britain, with stakes in Sainsbury’s, Harrods, the Canary 
Wharf development and Barclays Bank, among others.

The lack of tenants also gives developers Sellar another problem, as they will be liable for the annual business rates of up to £12 million due to Southwark Council, that would usually be paid by the businesses occupying the site.

Sellar say they are in talks over the bill – as the council decides when to start imposing the rates. ‘Paying rates could be up to two years away,’ a Shard source insisted.

In a statement, the company said: ‘The offices have not yet been rated. 
We are in discussion with the local authority as to when an appropriate 
date will be determined for rating purposes. The rating value is not 
confirmed.’

The Shard is not the only Central London block to be struggling to find tenants.

A building above Cannon Street station is only now on the point of signing its first deal, 18 months after it was completed.

And it took a reported 15 years to fill 1 Canada Square, the tower at the centre of the Canary Wharf development, which was also built in the midst of a downturn, in 1991.
