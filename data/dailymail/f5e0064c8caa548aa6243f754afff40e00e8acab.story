Gerard Baden-Clay was an 'arrogant and stony-faced' inmate on remand in Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre as he awaited trial for his wife's murder, but now faces having 'the crap beat out of him' in maximum security as he is processed as a sentenced prisoner.

Fellow inmate Kelvin Lloyd, 40, told Daily Mail Australia the convicted wife killer had the respect of fellow inmates for one reason: They believed he was guilty.

'He pretended he was not guilty but he earned the respect of other inmates because they thoughtÂ  he was guilty,' Mr Lloyd said.

Baden-Clay, 43, will spend tonight in the 600-inmate Wolston Correctional Centre, which houses the likes of reviled child killer and paedophile Brett Peter Cowan, who has been in protective custody since he was convicted in March for murdering 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe

Baden-Clay played occasional racket ball, but otherwise kept to himself reading science fiction novels.

Heavy duty: Gerard Baden-Clay was taken down into the cells beneath the Brisbane Supreme Court today after being pronounced guilty of murder and taken by prison van to the Wolston Correctional Centre (pictured) where he will live among 600 inmates in what is a maximum security protection prison for padeophiles, sex offenders and high profile prisoners

'Air of authority': Gerard Baden-Clay projected an 'air of authority' while imprisoned awaiting his murder trial at Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre (pictured) in far western Brisbane where he spent two years on remand, says fellow inmate Kelvin Lloyd. Now that Baden-Clay has been sent to Wolston prison, he could face having 'the cr*p beaten out of him', Mr Lloyd says

Mr Lloyd spent nine weeks on remand at the Arthur Gorrie facility at Wacol in Brisbane's far west, some of it in the B3 wing where Baden-Clay was housed.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, he said the wife killer spent most of his time studying law books and filling out affidavits and forms related to his murder trial.

'He was stony faced and to a degree arrogant,' said Mr Lloyd, who spent nine weeks on remand for charges related traffic offences and receiving goods.

'He was by no means among the biggest or toughest in B3 [protection] wing, but he had an air of authority and the majority of prisoners respected him.

'I reckon it's because they believed he was guilty, even if he pretended he was not.

'Once I'd seen the photos of the scratches on his cheek, I knew he was guilty.'

Doing time: Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured with his wife, Allison) spent time in his jail cell studying law books and filling out forms and affidavits leading up to his trial for Allison's murder, all to no avail. He spends tonight at the Wolston prison, a protection facility for sex offenders and high profile criminals

Eden Jessup, with her father Geoff, were some of the people who visited the memorial near Kholo Creek where Allison Baden-Clay's body was found on Tuesday

After the verdict was delivered, local residents paid tribute to the Brisbane mother by laying yellow flowers - her favourite colour - on a memorial

Family and friends of Allison Baden Clay joined police at Brisbane bar called The Guilty Rogue - down the road from the courthouse - to watch the news, including Geoff Dickie on right who is comforted by a friend

Mr Lloyd said Baden-Clay kept himself busy with 'heaps of mail' arriving at the prison, which related to his legal case, or with his nose in sci-fi novels.

He said Baden-Clay's three daughters visited him at the Arthur Gorrie facility in the company of their paternal grandparents.

He said the treatment Baden-Clay got from other inamtes at the centre would be different now he has been convicted and sentenced to a maximum of life in prison.

After Baden-Clay's sentencing today, Queensland police blocked off the exit from the Brisbane Supreme Court with a police cordon and then an escort of police vehicles accompanied the prison van on its 22km journey from the court out to Wolston prison.

Wolston is a maximum security 'protection' prison which houses paedophiles, sex offenders, convicted police officers and high profile prisoners like Baden-Clay.

'I reckon he'll get the crap beaten out of him,' Mr Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia.

'He's that high profile. They'll have to put him in isolation.'

Inmates together: Gerard Baden-Clay will join reviled child killer and paedophile Brett Peter Cowan (pictured), who has been on deep protection inside Wolston Correctional Centre since being convicted in March of the 2003 murder of Sunshine Coast teenager, Danilel Morcombe

Mr Lloyd said Baden-Clay wasn't the biggest or toughest in the prison, but had an air of authority about him
