Michelle Obama has revealed that there is one look that she feels she can't pull off: shorts.

The First Lady is regularly hailed for her fashion sense but said that she felt she stepped across the bounds by showing off her legs.

During a visit to BET talk show '106 and Park', she cited one of her more casual trips on Air Force One as her biggest fashion faux pas.

No go: The First Lady, seen here in 2009 with her daughter Malia, said that there was some backlash after she wore shorts on Air Force One so she doesn't really wear shorts anymore

Fashion forward: Michelle Obama made an appearance on BET's talk show '106 and Park' on Tuesday

'Sometimes as First Lady, sometimes I forget I’m the First Lady and I’m running around in shorts,' she said, referring to an August 2009 trip to the Grand Canyon.

'I know the first time we went on a family vacation, I had shorts on getting off of Air Force One and that created a huge stink because people were like, she’s wearing shorts getting off of Air Force One. And I thought, "what, we’re on vacation!"'

Since that backlash, she has shied away from wearing shorts, opting for longer capris or skirts and dresses in hotter climates.

She also cools off by opting for sleeveless shirts that show her toned arms- including in her official White House portrait.

Raising eyebrows: She said that the problem arose because sometimes she forgets that she is the First Lady and should dress as such at all times

Other than the slight slip up in 2009, Mrs Obama wasn't able to think of any other fashion missteps.

'I kind of always am happy with what I’m wearing,' she said.

Mrs Obama said that in addition to every fashion choice being scrutinized another downside of living in the White House is the lack of anonymity.

'Being able to walk out your front door on your own without agents, people following you around,' she said.

'I just long to walk out that front door, go to CVS and buy some toothpaste, and nobody would notice me.'

She said that it was easier for her to go on dog walks or unannounced trips to Target in the beginning of her husband's presidency, and she used a baseball cap to help her go incognito, but she recalled how one time she thought her disguise was not enough.

'The first time I did that I was in an aisle, one woman walked up to me and she tapped me on the shoulder, and I thought, "Okay, she's seen me." And she said, "Can you reach up there and hand me that detergent?"' Mrs Obama said.

Partners in stride: Mrs Obama, seen with her husband on Wednesday as they head to the Medal of Freedom ceremony, said that the President sings on a regular basis

She went on to praise her husband's musical skills, which he has demonstrated at a number of events where he slipped in a few lines of a song.

'It was really sweet. But he sings all the time. Oh, yes, he’s in the bathroom all the time just singing,' she said.

'He is always willing to sing. He’s like, "You want me to sing now, want me to sing something for you?" But he has got a good voice.'

He may hog the family's musical talent but she said it is very well understood that she is the dancing queen in the Obama household.

Tall order: Mrs Obama said that her daughters felt that her appearance on BET's 106 and Park gave her 'street cred', as she is seen waving with hosts Bow Wow and Keshia Chante

'Without a doubt. He can sing. I can dance. I think that divides the talent evenly across the family tree. We’re all satisfied,' she said. 

But her husband does have swag.

'I always say my husband has got swag,' she said to applause. 'He’s got a little swag.'

Mrs Obama stopped by the television show during a trip to New York on Tuesday and she clearly chose her outfit accordingly by sporting a leather jacket and printed top.

Earlier on Tuesday she attended a fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown.
