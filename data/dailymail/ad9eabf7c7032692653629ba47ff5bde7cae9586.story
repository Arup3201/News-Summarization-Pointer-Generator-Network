The security system at Vice President Joe Biden's Delaware private residence malfunctioned so badly late last year that Secret Service agents had to shut it off.

What's more, Saturday's shooting outside the New Castle County estate, when a motorist unloaded several rounds before speeding away, wasn't caught on camera because there wasn't one trained on the road, the Washington Post reports.

Despite the gaps in his home's security--and the embattled state of affairs within the Secret Service ranks--Vice President Biden said he's not concerned about his family's safety.

Revealed: The security system at Vice President Joe Biden's private residence in Delaware malfunctioned so badly last year that it was shut off for months prior to servicing, it was revealed Tuesday

Scary: News of the faulty security system comes just days after a motorist drove by the vice president's home over the weekend and unloaded several rounds from a firearm

Biden tells CBS This Morning on Wednesday his house is way off the road, and that there was no evidence that someone shot at the house. 

Biden says it appears someone fired from the passenger side of the vehicle, and his house is on the driver's side.

He said, 'I'm not at all worried.' Biden quipped that he doesn't think anyone's trying to get him — 'at least not physically.'

The Washington Post's report on Tuesday nonetheless reveals some potentially gaping cracks in the mansion's security perimeter.

Changes? Following the shooting, it was revealed that no security cameras were pointed toward the road at Biden's home. The Secret Service is now looking into installing additional cameras after they failed to catch the gun-toting motorist on camera

The home's security system was shut off for months because of false alarms and unreliable data, a source told the Post.

While the system was repaired in November, this weekend's incident has led to the Secret Service to propose adding more cameras in order to cover a broader area outside the home. 

Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan did not provide any details on potential upgrades.

'As a practice the Secret Service does not discuss the condition, number or locations of cameras and alarms at facilities we protect since this is the type of information our adversaries desire,' Donovan told the Post. 'On the night of the incident in Delaware, the appropriate security measures were in place and fully functioning.'

Shakeup: The incident at Biden's home came as a major shakeup was taking place within the ranks of the embattled Secret Service

Four of the highest-ranking Secret Service executives have been reassigned following a series of security mishaps and scathing reports questioning leadership within the agency, the Secret Service said last week.

Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy recently said 'change is necessary' within his agency 

The agency's assistant directors for investigations, protective operations, technology and public affairs have all been reassigned within the Secret Service.

Acting Director Joseph P. Clancy said in a statement that he was making leadership changes based on a December report from an independent panel that described the agency as 'insular' and 'starved for leadership.'

'Change is necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we conduct business,' Clancy said. 'I am certain any of our senior executives will be productive and valued assets either in other positions at the Secret Service or the department.'

The four officials are: Dale Pupillo, who led protective operations; Paul Morrissey, who oversaw the agency's investigative mission; Jane Murphy, who was governmental and public affairs chief; and Mark Copanzzi, who headed up technology and the tools for mission support. Details of their new posts were not released Wednesday.

The reassignments are the biggest shift in Secret Service leadership since former Director Julia Pierson was forced to resign last year. Her ouster came after a Texas man armed with a knife was able to get over a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being subdued and details of a previous presidential security breach were disclosed.

The Washington Post first reported the staff shakeup last week.

The independent panel, which investigated the agency's leadership and practices in the wake of the September incident and the disclosure of a previously unreported security breach earlier that month, also recommended hiring a new director from outside the agency.

A permanent director has not been named.

That report was the second critical review of the agency responsible for protecting the president. In November the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the Secret Service, released an internal investigation about the fence-scaling incident, which concluded that poor training, staff and a series of missteps led to the breach.

Homeland Security investigators found, among other things, that uniformed agents patrolling the White House grounds the night of Sept. 19 mistakenly assumed that thick bushes near the mansion's front door would stop the intruder.
