One in five adolescents has been knocked unconscious while playing sport at school - a figure that has shocked researchers.

Brain injuries measured in the research included cases where children had been unconscious for at least five minutes and those who had needed to be hospitalised over night.

Most previous studies have only recorded hospital cases of children's brain injuries; the addition of self-reported concussion which did not result in hospital treatment has now raised serious concerns in Canada, where the study was carried out.

Risk?: Large-scale Canadian study find s that one in five teenagers has been knocked unconscious during sport at school

In Canada, 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable young people involve a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Brain injuries among adolescents are particularly concerning because their brains are still developing.

There
 is growing evidence that people who have had one or more concussions 
are at greater risk of future concussions, and evidence that multiple 
brain injuries can result in lasting cognitive impairment, substance 
use, mental health and physical health harms.

The large-scale Canadian study found that teenagers who drank alcohol and smoked cannabis, and those who scored lower grades were more likely to suffer. Researchers also found that boys were more susceptible than girls to get knocked out.

Sports such as ice hockey and football accounted for more than half the injuries, said Dr Gabriela Ilie, lead author of the study and a post-doctoral fellow at St Michael's Hospital, in Toronto, Ontario.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was one of the first to focus only on adolescents and their self-reported traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).Â  Concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury.

The data used in the study were from the 2011 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), developed by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

It is one of the longest ongoing school surveys in the world and contains responses from almost 9,000 students from grades seven to 12 in publicly funded schools across Ontario.

Teenagers most likely to get knocked out during sport were those who drank alcohol, smoked cannabis or achieved lower school grades

The OSDUHS began as a drug use survey, but is now a broader study of adolescent health and well-being. For the first time in 2011, questions about traumatic brain injury were added to the survey.

The survey found that 20 per cent of adolescents in Ontario said they had had a traumatic brain injury in their lifetime.

It found that 5.6 per cent of them had had such an injury in the past 12 months.

Dr Ilie said this suggests the prevalence of TBIs among young people is much higher than previously known, because many head injuries remain uncounted when they are not being reported to parents, teachers, sports coaches or health care workers.

In Canada, 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable youth involve a TBI.

This new research found that 46.9 per cent of the TBIs reported by adolescent females occurred during sports (e.g., hockey, skateboarding); the figure was 63.5 per cent for males.

Students who reported drinking alcohol 'occasionally/frequently' and those who reported using cannabis 10 or more times over the past 12 months had more than five times and more than three times the odds, respectively, of acquiring a traumatic brain injury in the past 12 months than students who reported abstinence.

The survey also showed that students who reported overall poor grades at school (below 60 per cent) had almost four times the odds of a lifetime acquired brain injury than students who reported grades at or above 90 per cent.

'Traumatic brain injury is preventable,' said Dr Ilie. 'If we know who is more vulnerable, when and how these injuries are occurring, we can talk to students, coaches, and parents about it.

'We can take preventive action and find viable solutions to reduce their occurrence and long-term effects.'
