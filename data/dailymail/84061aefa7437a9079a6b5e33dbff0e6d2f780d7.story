Convicted: Adam Gordon attacked Rachel Kirby

A burglar who repeatedly punched a 
heavily-pregnant woman in her stomach after she woke to find him 
ransacking her bedroom has been jailed.

Adam Gordon, 22, brutally attacked Rachel Kirby, 31, up to 11 times after she bravely fought him off.

The
expectant mother - who lived in the same street as her 
attacker - was knocked to the floor before being pounded in the stomach 
by Gordon.

It is believed that she went on to have a healthy child.

Police later caught the father-of-two - 
despite him trying to hide his face during the brutal assault by wearing
 Miss Kirby’s pink hooded dressing gown.

Gordon, from Fenton, Staffs., was 
caged for 38 months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Tuesday after 
admitting burglary and causing actual bodily harm.

Jailing Gordon, Judge Paul Glenn told him: 'The victim was plainly vulnerable, living alone and heavily pregnant.

'I accept in panic, to avoid detection and to escape, you attacked her.

'But you could have pushed her aside and fled.

'There was no need to use the sort of violence you did. You punched her repeatedly.

'It is a matter of good fortune her injuries were not more serious.

'It was an extremely frightening incident which I am quite sure she will never forget.'

Gordon broke into Miss Kirby’s home just after 2.30am last December.

He crept into the upstairs bedroom but was challenged by startled Rachel who woke up.

Samantha Crabb, defending, said the assault was an aggravating feature of the burglary and the victim was in her home.

Miss Crabb said: 'He accepts he reacted in panic to her alarm at him being in her bedroom.

'His violence was delivered in panic in an attempt to get out of the room.'
