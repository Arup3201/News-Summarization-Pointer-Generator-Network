In the portable action camera market, GoPro reigns supreme.

But Polaroid and HTC could be about to make a claim for the throne with handheld devices of their own.

The former is planning to release the Polaroid Cube next week, a tiny action camera with a distinctive square design.

And a teaser video and leaked images reveal that HTC is planning to release a similar device of its own, in the shape of a toy periscope.

Taiwan-based HTC and Minnesota-based Polaroid are planning to release handheld cameras to take on GoPro. The Polaroid Cube (shown) is a 1.5-inch magnetic device that sicks to bikes. It can take 1080 or 720p video and still images at six megapixels. It will go on sale 1 October for £89 ($99.99)

The Polaroid Cube will be available for £89 ($99.99) from 1 October.

It measures 1.5 inches (3.8cm) on all its sides and can capture high definition video at 1080 or 720p.

Still images can also be taken at a resolution of six megapixels with its one-button operation. 

It charges via USB and can store 32GB of video and images with a microSD card.

The device is splash proof but, if user's are planning to submerge it in water, they'll need to use the included waterproof casing.

In addition, the device is magnetic, and it can easily attach to bikes and other surfaces using an included clip - something that fans of GoPro will be pleased to hear.

An integrated microphone and LED-light for night use round out the features. 

The Polaroid Cube is splash proof but not waterproof, so a protective casing (shown left) will need to be used if it goes underwater. A bump casing (right) also helps it survive tumbles and falls

If you've ever wondered what your dog really gets up to, or simply wanted to experience life from a dog's point of view, a new harness could be the answer.

The Fetch harness lets owners attach a high definition GoPro camera, made famous by extreme sports enthusiasts, to their pet.

Owners can even choose their point of view - either mounting the camera on the dog's back or chest. 

HTC's device, meanwhile, is called the ReCamera.

The device is small and appears to be curved at one end.

In a teaser video, it is shown shooting underwater, highlighting its waterproof capabilities.

And it also appears it can shoot in slow motion, based on the slower segments of the teaser video.

In one of the leaked images, first spotted by Reddit user fodawim, the device seems to be attached to the strap of a bag, suggesting it will be easily mountable on different objects.

No other details have been released, or leaked.  

A Twitter account set up for the camera, @re_camera, has just one tweet at the moment. 

It said: ‘Taking a picture has traditionally meant you’re busy behind the camera, framing the scene. But what have you been missing?’

And in the teaser video the company said: ‘Something remarkable is coming.’ 

Taiwan-based HTC has teased a new camera to compete with GoPro. The portable action camera will be formally announced on 8 October. In a video it appears the device is waterproof, while leaked images (one shown) reveal that it looks a bit like a toy periscope with a button below the lens to maybe take selfies

Called the RECamera the device is small enough to be handheld (shown in leaked image) and seems to be curved at one end. In a teaser video it is also shown shooting underwater, highlighting its waterproof capabilities. And it also appears it can shoot in slow motion, based on the slower segments of the teaser video

Towards the end of the video, two people place the camera on a table and get themselves in the frame of the picture.

While this could just be them posing for a video, the way it is set up hints that the device may also have some sort of selfie-taking ability.

Whatever the device can do exactly, and just how closely it will compete with Go Pro, will be revealed on 8 October.
