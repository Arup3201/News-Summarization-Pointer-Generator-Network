David Cameron’s popularity is growing in Scotland but he should offer to devolve more power to win over voters, a Tory peer has said.

Lord Ashcroft said many Scots said the Tory party was the best one to deal with the deficit and the economy, but they were often put off voting for it because they believed it is for ‘farmers and toffs’, that it does not care about Scotland and that their vote would be wasted.

The party should offer to hand more powers to Edinburgh, including full fiscal responsibility, said Lord Ashcroft, who funded eight months of research, including a poll of 10,000 people.

His report, Cameron’s Caledonian Conundrum, highlighted the fact that the Conservatives had just one MP in Scotland, but added: ‘Despite the party’s shrinking vote share, there are  potential Tories at large in Scotland.’

Regarding the 2014 independence referendum, he said: ‘If the Scots vote to keep the Union, more powers for Edinburgh could be to the party’s political advantage.

'As long as voters think the Scottish Parliament exists to sign the cheques, while the fiscal prudence happens elsewhere, the Conservatives will seem redundant.’

Over the party’s relevance in Scottish elections, he said: ‘Many who would support the Conservatives if they lived in England instead vote to try to keep out whichever of Labour or the SNP they believe more disastrous.’

He also called for the Tories to stand up more for Scotland in Westminster. He said: ‘This will mean more campaign support and more  attention given to the effects in Scotland of national policy decisions.’

Lord Ashcroft identified 15 per cent of Scots as ‘Reluctant Cameroons’, who supported the PM’s policies but could not bring themselves to vote Tory.

Just 8 per cent – the ‘Tory Core’ – would always vote Conservative, while 9 per cent fell into the ‘Willing to Listen’ group, who lean toward Labour but prefer Mr Cameron as PM.

‘Ed Miliband had made little positive impression on the participants,’ Lord Ashcroft found, although he was still the preferred PM because Scots are more likely to vote Labour.

Meanwhile, ‘Nick Clegg was widely dismissed as being ineffectual within the Coalition’.

An independent Scotland would be at greater risk from terrorists, crime gangs and cyber-hackers, an official review has concluded. The report, commissioned by Home Secretary Theresa May, said that Scots would have to endure ‘diminished security’ while they built an intelligence service because they would be denied access to information from MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the National Crime Agency.
