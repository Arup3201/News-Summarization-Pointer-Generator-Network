Arsenal starlet Chuba Akpom rescued a dramatic late victory for England Under 20s after coming on to score a brace in their 3-2 win over Holland.

England youngsters had beaten Germany in their opening game of the Four Nations Tournament in Heerenveen, before manager Aidy Boothroyd made nine changes to face the hosts.

Holland's Jordy de Wijs opened the scoring before England drew level on the stroke of half-time through Everton forward Chris Long.

England (4-2-3-1): Walton (Brighton);  Hayden (C) (Arsenal),  Ball (Tottenham),  Jones (Liverpool),  Dabo (Chelsea); Houghton (Chelsea),  Pearson (Manchester United); Rothwell (Manchester United),  Murphy (Norwich City),  Swift (Chelsea);  Long (Everton).

Substitutes:  Hause (Wolves) for Dabo, 61. Robinson (Aston Villa) for Ball, 75. Akpom (Arsenal) for Hayden, 87.  Thomas (Derby County) for Murphy, 87.

Substitutes not used: Wildsmith (Sheffield Wednesday), Targett (Southampton),  Reed (Southampton), Digby (Barnsley).

Goals: Long (45), Akpom (89, 90+1) 

The Dutch regained the lead shortly after the interval when Rai Vloet stroked home a penalty, prompting Boothroyd to take a gamble by bringing on two forwards for defenders.

It was a move that paid off handsomely with Akpom levelling from the spot in the 89th minute before snatching an unlikely victory in extra time.

'We were 2-1 down with a few minutes to go and we simply had to go for it,' Boothroyd told TheFA.com after the game. 

'Sometimes you make substitutions and they work, and sometimes they don't. On this occasion Chuba came on and scored two great goals,' added Boothroyd.

'But the whole team never gave in and never stopped believing.

'We want to teach them about tactics and the psychological side of things – but there's a lot to be said for downright determination and resilience – and this group has that in abundance.

'And that's why we won the game in the end. We might not have been the better team, but we still won and I'm very pleased.

Akpom was equally delighted by the performance after celebrating his 19th birthday during the week.

'I'm absolutely buzzing, these are the kind of moments you live for,' he said

'To see it fly in was the best feeling ever. I just felt full of adrenalin and then the whole team piled on top of me.'

England's next and final fixture of the round-robin tournament is against Turkey at 6pm on Monday 13 October.
