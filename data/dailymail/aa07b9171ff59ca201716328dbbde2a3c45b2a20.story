Jilted husband Kevin Cotter has turned the heartbreak of his divorce into a nice little profit by publishing a book full of  ingenious ways to use his ex-wife's wedding dress.

Kevin, 41, was crushed when his wife of 12 years walked out in 2009, taking all her possessions except the white silk gown.

When he asked her to take the dress back, she refused and told Kevin to 'do what the f*** he liked with it'.

Jilted husband Kevin Cotter published book of 101 ingenious ways to use his ex-wife's wedding dress after she walked out on him after 12 years of marriage. Here the dress is being used as a cape

The dress being used as a Snow Shooting camouflage. Kevin, 41, was initially crushed when his wife  walked out in 2009, taking all her possessions except the white silk gown - but then he started using is pain for gain

So he did - and for the last four years he has come up with a series brilliant ideas and filled a book with them.

Some of the best include a hammock, a superhero's cape and even a boat sail and he has documented them all on his blog.

Kevin, from Tuscon, Arizona, said: 'The idea came up when I was having dinner with my parents, brother, and sister-in-law a little while after my ex moved out.

'At dinner I explained to my family that she left the dress and asked them what I thought was a serious question - what do I do with it?

'My brother suggested I wipe my ass with it and my sister-in-law said there were probably 101 uses so we immediately took out a pen and paper and started brainstorming ideas.'

When the mother of his two children walked out in 2009, Kevin was understandably gutted, but decided to use the abandoned wedding dress as therapy.

With the help of his brother, he turned the dress into a dog toy, skipping rope and a footrest.

Here the dress is being used as a zombie bride costume - just one of the ingenious uses Kevin came up with

Then after coming up with more than 40 ideas, including using the tulle as a pasta strainer and the fabric as an excellent coffee filter, he collated them in a book.

Unsurprisingly, his exploits have not pleased his ex-wife, who has even said she hopes he seeks counselling to deal with his anger and resentment.

Kevin said: 'My wife hates it and thinks I am motivated by revenge - which isn't the case at all.

'This honestly doesn't have anything to do with her.

'I did it for myself because I thought it would be fun and wanted to answer the question - what can be done with a once worn wedding dress?'

Kevin re-married in 2010, to Ashley Nowe, 28, and he now lives with her and their 'blended family' of five children.

After dating for a year and a half, they planned their wedding in just nine days and threw it in their backyard.

He joked: 'She said earlier in our relationship that if it worked out and one day we were to be married, it would have to be a beach wedding and she would wear a bikini.

'She said she would not risk leaving me with any amount of material for a sequel.

'But in the end, she was brave and wore a dress.'
