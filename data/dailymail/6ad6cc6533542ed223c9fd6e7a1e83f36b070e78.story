Routine hospital appointments for cancer survivors should be scrapped to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed by demand, according to a leading charity.

Macmillan Cancer Support said the current system whereby most patients recovering from the disease are automatically booked for six-monthly check-ups was wasteful and did not target those most in need.

Instead, doctors should identify those who require specialist support.

The time spent by hospitals on routine follow-up appointments has increased almost 10-fold since the 1970s, because of rising numbers of cancer cases and higher survival rates. There are two million people who are either living with the disease or have recovered from it.

This number is expected to double by 2030, with the survival time for all cancers rising from just one year 40 years ago to almost six years on average. Patients are living longer due to factors such as timely diagnosis and new drugs.

Ciaran Devane, the charity's chief executive, said many survivors are left with long-term health and emotional problems, and feel abandoned by the NHS.

But the present system does not address these issues and fails to provide patients and GPs with information that could lead to recurrent cancers being detected promptly.

Mr Devane said: 'The current follow-up appointments system is past its sell-by date. The health and social care services across the UK must radically transform how they deal with patients' aftercare, especially as the number of people getting and surviving cancer is soaring.

'Doctors need to be able to identify which patients need regular face-to-face appointments and specialist support, and which don't.

'They also need to support cancer patients to develop the skills to manage their own conditions.'

He added: 'The pressure on hospitals will only get worse. Cancer specialists will be overloaded if we continue with the current system, which is wasteful for the NHS and does not give survivors the support they actually need.'

Death rates from cancer in Britain have fallen by more than a fifth since 1990. The charity said about one in five survivors was likely to benefit from regular follow-up appointments.

But all needed to be given more information about symptoms that could mean the return of the disease, or other conditions associated with it.

These were unlikely to be detected in routine check-ups.

Two out of five people living with cancer are unaware of the long-term side effects of cancer treatment, according to the charity's research. It found just a third were give information about coping with the effects of the disease or treatment.

Studies have found the risk of osteoporosisÂ  is doubled in prostate cancer survivors due to side effects from treatment.
