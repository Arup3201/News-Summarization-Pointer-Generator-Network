More than 120 Britons were rescued last night after being stranded on a cruise ship in Austria for almost a week because of torrential rain.

The Dutch-registered Filia Rheni had just left Vienna last Saturday when shipping on the Danube was halted because the river was so swollen.

It was anchored only yards from the bank but rescuers said evacuating the passengers, mostly pensioners, would have been too dangerous because of the debris sweeping downstream.

The passengers had been stranded for almost a week because of torrential rain

However, last night they constructed a pontoon bridge and the holidaymakers, some tearful, were helped ashore.

Most were put on a bus to Budapest where a plane was waiting to take them home. A passenger said of the crew: ‘They had a strategy, they gave us plenty to drink, and it worked.’

They also had to cross over a normally busy rail line that had to be closed down for the rescue attempt.

It took three hours to bring all the holidaymakers to shore.

Most were hurried on to the bus to take them to Budapest where a plane was waiting to bring them home but one woman who did speak was Audrey Wastnidge, 82, from London.

She said: 'It was very frustrating, we went on a cruise that never moved. But the crew worked overtime to keep up morale.

One passenger said of the crew: 'They had a strategy, they gave us plenty to drink, and it worked'

'They updated us all the time about our situation. We had plenty of food and drink. They organised games for us to keep us in a good mood. There were quizzes, we played chess and mini-golf to keep our minds off the problem.

'I was personally not worried, although I could see that some people were concerned. I was mainly frustrated that we did not get to do our cruise.'

The Danube has reached heights not 
seen for 500 years and jetties along the river have been swamped and 
dozens of ships abandoned.

The Dutch-registered Filia Rheni cruiser was the only one that still had passengers onboard.

Prior to the rescue the ship was tied to a pontoon until the waters receded.

Skipper
 Hauvelman said: 'The ship isn't easily damaged. It is made of iron, not
 plastic. I have experienced this situation before in my years as a ship
 captain.

Emergency services attempted to rescue the British tourists for the first time yesterday. Previously, the stricken cruise liner had only been accessible by small boat

Passengers were marooned on the stricken cruise liner after the Danube rose to unprecedented levels

Jetties along the swollen river were submerged, which trapped the 120 British passengers on the liner

The landing bridge was under water and emergency services were on stand-by in case the liner moved in the fast current

Passengers had enough food and drink according to the skipper and were waiting for flood waters to recede

The boat was only accessible by small dinghies which made it too dangerous to evacuate the 120 passengers

Much of Europe has been hit by floods with some areas seeing the worst flooding for 400 years

'All passengers are safe. The ship is safe - there is no danger of it dislodging.

'There is enough food and drink on board
 and the passengers are in good spirits. Plans are in place to rescue 
the passengers in an emergency.

'It is just a matter of time. We hope that in one or two days the water levels will start to fall.

'I have been talking to the passengers and reassuring them.'

He said he has experienced similar situations at least a dozen times while travelling on major rivers such as the Rhine and Neckar.

The cruise liner was only accessible by small dinghy and the current was too strong to evacuate all passengers that way.

The British passengers were already on board the cruise when the river reached unprecedented levels.

It rose too fast to safely evacuate.

The liner is one of about 30 moored along the river in Vienna until the water levels drop.

In Vienna, the 
Danube peaked Wednesday at levels above those of the 2002 floods that 
devastated Europe.

The city's extensive protection system held, however,
 although the highway to the airport was temporarily inundated.

The rescue comes after dozens of village residents had to be airlifted to safety yesterday by helicopters after the Danube reached heights not seen in over 500 years in the German city 
of Passau.

It then surged downstream to crash through a levee in the 
southern village of Deggendorf.

Yesterday, the river smashed through another levee, engulfing entire neighborhoods in the same village.

'We would have risked our lives had we stayed at home,' Deggendorf 
resident Hans Loefflmann said, adding that he and his wife had to leave 
all their valuables behind when the floods gushed into their house 
within minutes.

At least 16 people have died in the flooding of the Danube and Elbe rivers in central Europe this week and at least four others are missing.

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in the region, including over 700 in the eastern German city of Dresden, where the Elbe crested Thursday at 21 feet above normal levels.

The Danube is normally around 400 yards wide as it passes the city's imposing Hungarian parliament building. 

The Elbe river is threatening the historic city centre of Dresden which was also damaged by floods in 2002

Now its waters are lapping at the

heavily used roads on both sides of the river.

Large parts
 of Germany are underwater and hundreds of volunteers in Germany 
prepared sandbags today in preparation for the imminent flood.

Residents
 and emergency crews worked through the night in Dresden and other 
cities to bolster riverbanks and build sandbag barriers as floodwaters 
that have already claimed 16 lives in Europe roared farther north 
through Germany.

The Elbe river was expected to crest today in Dresden, the capital of Saxony state that was devastated during the massive flooding in 2002.

This time, the famous historic city centre has so far largely escaped damage.

In the Saxony-Anhalt city of Bitterfeld, an attempt to blow open a levee to lower waters threatening the city along the Mulde river was unsuccessful.

Some 30,000 residents in nearby Halle were urged to evacuate. 

The situation in the Bavarian town of Deggendorf remained critical, as another levee burst Thursday morning and the Danube engulfed entire neighborhoods.
