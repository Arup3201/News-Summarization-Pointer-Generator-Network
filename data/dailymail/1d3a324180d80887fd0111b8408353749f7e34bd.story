This south west London home can be seen in everything from TV adverts to photos on luxury design websites - and LuLu has even lounged on the garden furniture.

And though you would probably not recognise the 
stylish sofas or clean white walls, the homeowner makes up to £1200 a day 
handing over the keys to directors and photographers who have used his house for hundreds of shoots.

Now for the first time, theatre producer James Tod has opened his front door to reveal Britain's most-photographed home - his four-floor terraced townhouse in South Lambeth, London.

Popular location: Theatre producer James Tod, pictured in his sleek and modern kitchen, owns the four-floor terraced townhouse in south west London which has featured in hundreds of shoots

Blank canvas: A spokesperson from the location agency explained that the house's white walls, bright colours and amazing natural light make it perfect for magazine shoots like this one of Lulu

Since signing up to a locations agency seven years ago, Mr Tod has had celebrities draped over his garden furniture and babies crawling on the carpet - sometimes as many as three times a week.

Advertisers and TV executives spend a day filming or photographing inside for projects as varied as computer game adverts to glossy celebrity magazines.

They often transform the two-bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours, before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house Mr Tod left in the morning.

MR Tod, 46, said: 'It’s bizarre when you’re watching the telly or flicking through a magazine suddenly you think, oh blimey that’s my living room.

'Sometimes they’ll put wallpaper up for just a day but it all gets put back - you just have to be very relaxed about what happens when you’re out of the house!'

The lower-ground floor of James’s home has a huge open plan living space and double doors onto a garden that has hosted photo shoots for LuLu.

Exotic: The agency said that Mr Tod's beautiful garden, pictured, is a huge draw for shoot directors looking for locations. The owner said that coming home in the middle of his home's first shoot was a real shock

Natural beauty: With some simple white garden furniture - and TV presenter Rachel De Thame - the London garden is transformed for a bright and bold magazine shoot

City chic: One of Mr Tod's pieces of furniture was brought outside for LuLu to lounge on when she posed for this photo, right, that was printed as part of a glossy magazine spread

Upstairs, there’s a kitchen where a food company spent hours photographing bacon sandwiches and there are two bedrooms and space for styling and quick changes.

'Getting it right for shoots and making it a home at the same time has been a challenge - you’ve got to have enough interesting furniture and art to perk up the white walls.

'The first two or three times we had a shoot I was left in shock - the volume of stuff they bring with them is incredible. We once had ten sofas in our living room plus camera crews and stylists.

'I’ve had them paint the walls and move everything around so it’s barely recognisable more times than I can remember.

Bright and airy: Directors and photographers often transform the two-bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours, before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house Mr Tod left

Looks familiar: Mr Tod's living space, pictured at the back of this image, had a handful of accessories added to it for this photo shoot, but it has sometimes hosted as many as 10 couches and dozens of soft furnishings

Pretty in pink: Bright, textured accessories and subtle purple flowers are used to add warmth to Mr Tod's neutral living space in this photograph from a magazine shoot

Young guests: Sometimes it is just glimpses of Mr Tod's much-photographed home that can be seen in photos or adverts, as with the two pictured above. The house's natural light means it is an easy place for photographers to shoot

'They always paint it back though so I’m sure there are 50 layers of the same paint colour on the walls.

'When there are celebrities shooting in the house and I’ve occasionally been working from home it’s been a real eye-opener.

'Most people have been very gracious and unassuming but you very quickly get to know when some with an attitude is in and it is diva central.

'Although I live in a pretty minimal way I still have to work to keep the house in pretty good nick.

Distinctive rugs: Directors and photographers often bring their own additional touches, like these rugs, to transform the way the South Lambeth home looks in pictures

Prints and patterns: Advertising executives using the house often cover the walls in wallpaper to create variation in their images, like in the ones pictured above. They later strip the house after the shoot

Caught on camera: An advert featuring Mr Tod's house. He said that it is bizarre when he is watching the television or flicking through a magazine and comes across a photo of his living room

'When people come to look round - it’s like an inspection from the school matron!

'Thankfully 1st Option [the location agency he registered with] has been really helpful - they always let us know when someone will be coming round so we’re prepared.

'And the house is redecorated every couple of years to make sure it’s bang on trend. We’ve got to give all those photographers and directors a new back drop!”

A 1st Option spokesperson said: 'We’ve been representing locations for stills and filming shoots for over 10 years and for the most part clients either want a blank canvas white location and they’ll decorate and prop according to their needs or then they want a location they can walk into and shoot.

Classic colour: Mr Tod's home features a number of white walls and pieces of furniture, allowing designers and directors to add their own pops of colour - like the pink cushions featured above - when they arrive for a shoot

A-list guests: Since signing up to a location agency seven years ago, Mr Tod's home has had celebrities draped over its garden furniture, pictured, and photogenic babies crawling along the carpet

Understated elegance: Mr Tod's garden, right, and an upstairs space in his home, left, as seen in photos taken from shoots. He said that he has to keep his decor updated and interesting without being too distinctive

'This home works well as a shoot location because of the variety it offers, lots of bright colours, good natural light and a fabulous garden.

'A flexible owner always helps, James is very easy going and lets clients get on with their shoot, he allows decorating shoots and has had multiple day shoots allowing wallpapering, painting, blinds and curtains to be put up. The client then re-instates to the way it was after their shoot.

'While we’re always looking for new shoot locations, we’re very particular about what we represent, the key elements are good natural light and space.

'If you’ve got a large traditional or modern house or apartment with nice features, wooden / parquet flooring, large bay / sash windows, traditional fireplaces, large open plan kitchen with island get in touch and we’ll let you know if we think we can get you work.'
