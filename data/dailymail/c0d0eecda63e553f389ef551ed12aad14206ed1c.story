Robert Toney failed to provide basic life-saving treatment to the baby when he arrived at the scene

A paramedic who failed to give adequate emergency care to a new-born baby boy that was blue and ‘looked dead’ was suspended for a year today.

Robert Toney raced to an address in Plymouth, Devon, after receiving an emergency call about a woman in labour.

But when he arrived he made no attempt to give the baby oxygen despite the fact that he was struggling to breathe, the Health and Care Professions Council heard.

Fellow paramedic Sheryl Hanks attended the scene shortly after Toney when the emergency call was made at 7.13am.

She said: ‘I immediately thought that baby was not breathing adequately enough - it looked a horrible colour and actually, in all honesty, it looked dead.

‘The baby was laid on towels with its arms up in the air above its head, not wrapped just with an open towel underneath it.’

Mrs Hanks explained the baby was in ‘serious respiratory distress, almost on the stage of death’ when she arrived.

She said Toney failed to provide basic life-saving ventilation oxygenation and that the standard of care given was inadequate.

Toney had worked for the South West Ambulance Service NHS Trust for 28 years.

He blew on the baby’s face and rubbed him with towels but did not use a resuscitation kit because he said he did not have the right equipment.

The baby improved on the journey to the hospital and recovered at Derriford General Hospital on arrival.

Toney was found to have provided inadequate care to the new-born baby, in that he did oxygenate or deliver ventiliations.

The panel also found that Toney did not seek urgent assistance or make his bosses aware of the baby’s condition.

HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe said: ‘The panel is satisfied that the registrant expressed real and genuine remorse as he wanted to see the family after the event to see if the baby was alright.

‘But the panel is of the view that the registrant has a limited insight into his failings, demonstrated by his admissions.

‘However, he does not fully accept that he has failed to act promptly in a time critical situation.

‘He has failed to demonstrate that he has reflected on the situation, has learned how things went wrong and how he would address such a situation differently in the future.

‘The trust had identified a college based assessment day in respect of paediatric care, the need for a reflective log and the need to be assessed by a tutor in terms of leadership before the registrant could return to being part of a crew.

‘The registrant failed to take up any of these suggestions and has instead decided that he no longer wishes to practise.

‘Although he is no longer operating as a paramedic, he remains employed on an ad hoc basis as an Emergency Care Assistant.

‘He has taken early retirement and said that he wished to avoid stress, wanted to give new paramedics an opportunity and wished to devote his time to family.

Toney was suspended from the profession for 12 months.
