Atheist: Shannon Morgan is suing to have her custom atheism license plate made

A New Jersey woman claims she was denied a custom license plate proclaiming her an atheist is suing the state to have it made.

Shannon Morgan, of Maurice Township, said in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that the Motor Vehicle Commission violated her First Amendment rights when its website rejected the plate reading '8THEIST' because it was deemed potentially offensive.

Morgan claims she then then filled out the online application using the phrase 'BAPTIST' as a test and the government-run website accepted it.

The woman sent the agency a letter of complaint by registered mail and made several attempts to contact them by phone, all of which went unanswered, she claims in the suit.

Americans United for Separation of Church and State is representing Morgan in the lawsuit.

The Washignton, D.C.-based group's website says it is 'dedicated to preserving the constitutional principle of church-state separation as the only way to ensure religious freedom for all Americans.'

Messages and emails left for the Motor Vehicle Commission on Friday were not returned.

A recorded message said the offices were closed in observance of Good Friday.

Denied: The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission denied this anti-religion license plate

Approved: But the state approved this 'BAPTIST' license plate without reservation

New Jersey previously, after a brief flap, approved a request from an atheist group's president for a license plate that read 'ATH1EST,' with the number one in place of the letter 'i.'

That dispute is mentioned in the suit, Gothamist reported.

'The commission thus has a practice of denying personalized license plates that identify vehicle owners as atheists, thereby discriminating against atheist viewpoints and expressing a preference for theism over non-theism.

'Although the commission eventually relented and granted Mr. Silverman his requested license plate, it refuses to allow Ms. Morganâ€™s requested plate.'

Ayesha N. Khan, the legal director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said the fact this has happened at least twice in New Jersey shows the problem has not been fixed.

The Motor Vehicle Commission is 'disfavoring atheist plates and not fixing the system. Whatever Internet glitch there might be cannot be the explanation this time,' Khan said, adding that they were seeking the enactment of new agency regulations that include 'objective, viewpoint-neutral criteria for issuing a plate.'
