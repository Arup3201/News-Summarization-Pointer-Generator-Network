A man woke up covered in blood after a stray cat got into his house and attacked him as he slept, he claimed.

Paul Goodrum, from Humberstone, Leicester, had his face clawed, narrowly missing his eye, and nose bitten by the stray feline and says he is thankful he was attacked and not a baby.

Mr Goodrum, 26, said: 'I thought I just had a runny nose but when I felt my face it was blood.

'I pushed the animal away and put on 
the light to see a very large white grey cat. I chased it out of my 
bedroom and examined the damage on my face.

'The
cat had scratched my eyelid and my cheek and forehead,' he continued, 
'There were also bite marks on either side of my nose. It was very 
frightening.'

He says he chased the cat out of his flat and rushed to tell his neighbours about the incident.

He said: 'I was worried young children in the area would be in danger after what happened to me.

'Just think of the horrific state this would have left a baby or young child in.'

Mr Goodrum shares the flat with his girlfriend and the couple own two cats. He says he believes the stray got in through the cat flap.

'My
girlfriend was staying with her parents and I was on my own, he said. 
'Our two cats were terrified and were hiding under the units in the 
kitchen to keep out of its way.'

Mr Goodrum, who works as an electrician, took the next day off work and went to his doctor for treatment.

He added: 'I had a tetanus injection and was lucky my eye had only been caught on the lid.'

Lise Goen, a qualified cat and dog behaviourist from Whitwick, said it was a strange incident.

She said: 'Strays getting into homes through cat flaps is very common, but I have not heard of a cat attacking someone who was asleep.

'Cats can be bold and territorial and it could be that the cat felt threatened by the man suddenly moving when he was asleep.

'It could have felt it was challenged by the other cats who lived in the flat.'

Miss Goen said pet owners should take action to ensure strays do not use cat flaps to get into homes.

'You can get cat flaps with powerful magnets and fit a magnet on the catâ€™s collar, which allows it to open,' she added.
