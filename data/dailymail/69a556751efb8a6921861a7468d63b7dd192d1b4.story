George Groves is 'back on the hunt for success' and itching to get back in the ring following back-to-back defeats to British super-middleweight rival Carl Froch.

Groves first lost his unbeaten record as a professional to WBA and IBF champion Froch in controversial fashion before suffering a one-punch knockout in the eighth round of their return bout in front of an 80,000 crowd at Wembley.

The Londoner has not been put off by the setbacks, however, and is aiming to get back on the winning trail against European champion at 168lbs Christopher Rebrasse in a contest that will also double as an eliminator for the WBC title.

Confident: Super-middleweight George Groves believes his third bid to win a world title will end in success

'I am back on the hunt for success and, in turn, will deliver a successful bid in a world title quest,' he said.

'The route chosen is a fantastic one, in my opinion.'

Groves will be hoping victory on September 20 and a successful showing will land him a shot at either current WBC champion Sakio Bika or Andre Dirrell, who fight each other next Saturday.

'It should be a tough match for both fighters, but either one I will beat after I defeat Rebrasse,' Groves added in his blog on Sportlobster.com.

The fight with Rebrasse takes place at Wembley Arena although Groves does not think there will be any mental scars as he returns to the place where he suffered his devastating defeat earlier this year.

'Wembley Arena has been a successful stomping ground in the past and I aim to continue this trend.

'Returning to Wembley could well be a tough challenge in itself.

'However, I know this won't be the case for me. I will relish the excitement of simulated emotions. It is when you most feel alive.

'In front of 80,000 people, I had the time of my life. Standing, parading and revelling in the atmosphere was one of my favourite and proudest moments.

'I hope and plan to be involved in making boxing history again one day.'
