A 3D-printed replica of King Richard III’s remains have been unveiled, ahead of the opening of a museum honouring the king tomorrow.

The centre tells the story of his rise to power, his death in battle and the discovery of his bones.

And curators hope that the museum will attract up to 100,000 visitors in its first year.

A replica of the skeleton of King Richard III (shown), created using 3D printing, has gone on display in a new visitor's centre on the site where his remains were discovered in Leicester. The centre, opening on 26 July, tells the story of his rise to power, his death in battle and the discovery of his bones

The exhibits include a remarkably detailed facial reconstruction and the replica of Richard’s skeleton.

Such is the detail of the replica that it clearly shows his curved spine, as well as his battle injuries, including the fatal blow that felled him.

The centre entitled ‘King Richard III: Dynasty, Death and Discovery’ will also raise questions about how his disability should be portrayed in theatre and film.

Other notable features include a new courtyard garden, glass entrance hall and cafe.

The exhibition will also include a glass balcony that will use technology to show visitors how the modern day view compares with that of the city in the Middle Ages.

Richard III's body received an unceremonious burial and the original tomb is believed to have been destroyed during the Reformation, with the remains being lost for more than five centuries.

In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on a city council car park in Leicester using ground-penetrating radar on the site. The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III (3Dreplica shown)

In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on a city council car park in Leicester using ground-penetrating radar on the site once occupied by Greyfriars.

The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III.

The skeleton of the last of the Plantagenet kings was identified by DNA analysis after researchers traced his living descendants.

The scientists concluded it was the 
remains of the King who had died in 1485 using a combination of the 
radiocarbon dating, a comparison with contemporary reports of his 
appearance, and a comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two 
matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York.

Investigators from the University of Leicester revealed that the remains bore the marks of ten injuries inflicted shortly before his death.

More gruesome, however, was evidence of ‘humiliation’ injuries, including several head wounds - part of the skull was sliced away - a cut to the ribcage and a pelvic wound likely caused by an upward thrust of a weapon, through the buttock.

The skeleton was described of that of a slender male, in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died.

The skeleton also had a distinctive curvature of the spine synonymous with the hunchback king immortalised by Shakespeare.

The university’s lead archaeologist Richard Buckley described the identity of the remains at the time as ‘beyond reasonable doubt.'

‘It is the academic conclusion of the University of Leicester that the individual exhumed at Greyfriars in August 2012 is indeed King Richard III, the last Plantagenet King of England.’

Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire.

During the War of the Roses, 
Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 
1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the
 rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward
 V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a
 campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth 
Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He
 was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes 
disappeared.

Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any 
threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

It
 has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, 
although rumours of a withered arm appeared to be unfounded.

Scientists also discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after 
finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard 
III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were 
infected with roundworm during his life.

Richard, depicted by William 
Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower 
of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led
 by Henry Tudor.

According to historical records, his 
body was taken 15 miles (24 kilometres) to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of 
his death before being buried in the Franciscan friary.

The team from Leicester University 
set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts, including
 the site where Richard was finally laid to rest.

They began excavating the city centre
 location in August last year and soon discovered the skeleton, which 
was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches (68 centimetres) below ground level.

It was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried.

To the naked eye, it was clear that the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head.

But archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests.

As they were found: The remains of King Richard III were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in Leicester last September, in what were once the precincts of Grey Friars church

The skull of the king as it was found by archaeologists: Trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a sword and a halberd

Hunched in death as he was in life: The skeleton was found in good condition with its feet missing

The Battle of Bosworth: Richard, pictured on the
 white horse, was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at Bosworth 
field, in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the 
Tudors

Speaking at a press conference after the discovery,
 University of Leicester geneticist Dr Turi King described how 
researchers had traced Richard’s descendants to confirm the body was 
indeed that of England’s last medieval king.

These were Canadian born furniture 
maker Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the Richard’s sister Anne of
 York, and a second person who has asked to remain anonymous.

Dr King said: ‘The DNA sequence 
obtained from the Grey Friars skeletal remains was compared with the two
 maternal line relatives of Richard III.

‘We were very excited to find that 
there is a DNA match between the maternal DNA from the family of Richard
 III and the skeletal remains we found at the Grey Friars dig.’

The king's actual remains are due to be sealed in a tomb at Leicester Cathedral next year.
