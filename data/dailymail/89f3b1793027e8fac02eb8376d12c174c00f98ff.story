The 24-year-old Stockport native, part of the qualifying draw at Flushing Meadows for the third consecutive year, would have approached her first-round qualifier full of confidence after winning three tournaments on the ITF circuit this year but lost 7-5 (8-6), 7-6 (7-2) in two hours and 16 minutes.

James Ward, Dan Evans and Dan Smethurst open their qualifying campaigns on Wednesday.
