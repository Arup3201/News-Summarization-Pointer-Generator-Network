Argentina forward Lionel Messi was presented with the Golden Ball award for the best player at the World Cup following his team's defeat by Germany in Sunday night's final.

Although widely regarded as the greatest talent on the planet, most were surprised at the decision to hand Messi the award given his failure to score in all four knockout-stage matches.

Messi did score four goals as he dazzled in the group stage, but Sportsmail's experts have come up with their alternative Golden Ball winners...

ROB DRAPER

Bastian Schweinsteiger: The player who, quietly to begin with, but by the final as an immense presence, epitomised the best team in the tournament. He has an understated ability which can dominate games just by his tactical intelligence and passing quality. But if we were judging up to the quarter-finals, I would have given it to Leo Messi, just above James Rodriguez.

MATT BARLOW

Manuel Neuer: Great tournament for goalkeepers and he was the best. Match-winning contributions and great force of personality. His brilliance allows Germany to play the way they do, with adventure and risk.

NEIL ASHTON

Manuel Neuer: The outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament. Assured throughout and confirmed he is the best in the world in his position.

IAN LADYMAN

Arjen Robben: Came in to the tournament with question marks over his appetite and his ethics and answered both with consistently brilliant displays throughout the tournament. Went to ground too easily on occasion but also took more whacks and stayed up more than just about anybody else.

MATT LAWTON

Thomas Muller: I think he was the perfect embodiment of what Germany represented. A fantastic work ethic, more than a touch of flair and a killer instinct.

Forward thinking: Robben (left) and Muller (right) were two of the best attackers in the tournament
