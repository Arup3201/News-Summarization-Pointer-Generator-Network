Attacks against British Jews have reached a record high fuelled by an explosion of violence in the Middle East.

Hate crimes of anti-Semitism doubled to exceed 1,000 in a single year for the first time last year, according to new figures.

The bloody conflict in Gaza and Israel is the single biggest contributor to the sure, the Community Security Trust (CST) said.

Officials at the group, which monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community, recorded 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in 2014.

This was more than double the 535 incidents recorded in 2013 and the highest annual total ever recorded.

The incidents ranged from violent attacks in the street to vile graffiti and criminal damage against synagogues and homes.

In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a ‘Jewish c***’ and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London.

In Manchester, a man was knocked off his bike and kicked while on the ground by a group of youths who called him a ‘Jew’.

A Jewish girl had deodorant sprayed in her face by a 12-year-old fellow pupil who said to her ‘gas the Jews’ at a school in Edinburgh.

And in London two men ran into a kosher restaurant where they intimidated diners before making a Nazi salute and shouting: ‘Heil, Adolf Hitler.’

The CST has logged anti-Semitic incidents in the UK since 1984, and the previous highest annual total came in 2009 when 931 anti-Semitic incidents were recorded.

Experts believe the conflict in Israel and Gaza, which took place in July and August, was the single biggest factor behind the increase.

They are braced for a similar spike this year after the attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris which left four people dead.

Officials said the attacks, which sent shockwaves around the world, led to an ‘unprecedented’ number of calls from worried Jews.

The CST received reports of anti-Semitic incidents from 89 different locations around the UK, including 81 attacks.

There were the same number of incidents of damage and desecration of Jewish property, 884 incidents of abusive behaviour and 92 direct anti-Semitic threats.

The group also recorded 233 anti-Semitic threats and comments made on social media, including Twitter and Facebook.

Last month Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there is ‘heightened concern’ about the risk to Jewish people since the attacks.

The figures have been released 10 days after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp which gassed more than a million Jews during the Second World War.

Home Secretary Theresa May described the latest figures as ‘deeply concerning’, adding: ‘Britain without its Jews would not be Britain.’

‘I am absolutely clear that everyone in this country, including members of Britain’s Jewish community, should be able to live their lives free from racial and religious hatred and harassment. No one should live in fear because of their beliefs or who they are.’

Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who has national responsibility for policing anti-Semitic crimes, called on people who suffer such crimes to always contact police.

He said: ‘The recent events in Paris are a reminder to all of us here in the UK that if we tolerate people being targeted because of their race, religion or even how they look the consequences are catastrophic.’

David Delew, who leads the CST, said the figures show ‘just how easily anti-Semitic attitudes can erupt into race hate abuse, threats and attacks’.

He said: ‘Thankfully most of the incidents were not violent but they were still shocking and upsetting for those who suffered them, and for the wider Jewish community.’
