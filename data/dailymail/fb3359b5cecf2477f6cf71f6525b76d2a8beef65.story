A 'military enthusiast' who threatened two nurses with a gun a day after shooting himself in the hand by mistake has been jailed for life.

Armed police arrested Christopher Turkington, 41, at Salford Royal Hospital, Greater Manchester, after reports that a man had grabbed two nurses and was waving a gun.

Firearms officers were able to arrest him and he was found to be in possession of four loaded revolvers.

Jailed: Christopher Turkington, 41, was sentenced to life after admitting four counts of possession of a firearm with intent. His wife Victoria Turkington, 40, got two years after a judge took into account extenuating actions

At Manchester Crown Court he was jailed for life after he admitted four counts of possession of a firearm with intent. He must serve a minimum of five years before he can apply for parole.

His wife Victoria Turkington, 40, who was with him at the time of his arrest, pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and was jailed for two years.

The court heard that Turkington had four antique guns at his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, along with other military antiques including stun grenades and machetes as well as military clothing.

Fearing impending Armageddon, he had also stockpiled tents and tins of food, as well as explosive manuals and chemicals, as well as crafting 218 bullets himself.

He had turned up at hospital on Thursday, 24 May, telling doctors he had injured his hand with a drill. But when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand.

Surgeons operated to remove the bullet and contacted police who questioned Turkington after he came round on the Friday, but did not arrest him.

Fearful that his arsenal would be discovered if police searched his home, he rang his estranged wife and told her to move his four guns and other weapons to her house.

Salford Royal Hospital: Turkington had turned on May 24 telling doctors he had hurt his hand with a drill. But when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand

Later that day he checked himself out of hospital and, plagued by 'voices in his head', went to his wife's home nearby where he took the guns loaded them with ammunition and returned to the hospital at 9.20pm.

He went to the hospital's Hope Building on surgical ward H5 and was seen waving a gun, before holding a nurse hostage at gunpoint and demanding access to a drugs cupboard.

The incident lasted around 10 minutes before firearms officers arrested the pair.

Nobody was injured in the incident.

At court Julian Taylor, prosecuting, 
said that Turkington had initially taken himself to hospital complaining
 of having a drill bit embedded in his hand.

He said: 'The police were informed and inquiries were made.

'After
 Mr Turkington discharged himself from hospital he later returned with 
four firearms, all loaded. He pressed the buzzer for assistance at 
9.20pm.

'He asked nurse for 
drugs and became insistent. He was seen by another nurse putting his arm
 around another nurse. He then produced a gun.'

Mr Taylor said Turkington was shouting: 'Don't worry I'm not going to hurt you.'

The court heard that he then added: 'If you don't get me any drugs soon I'm going to shoot myself.'

When armed response officers arrived he raised his arm, putting the gun to his head but he was arrested after the nurse he was holding courageously grabbed his arm, knocking the cocked weapon from his hand.

He later said of the hand wound that he doesn't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets.

Mr Taylor said that Turkington's psychiatric report stated that the injury was the result of a botched suicide attempt.

He said: 'Mr Turkington told police that he went back to the hospital to shoot himself.

'He thought that when he went back armed police would be there waiting for him and if he did not shoot himself they would do it for him. He was disappointed when they weren't there and said he needed to make it convincing.'

The court heard that the Turkingtons had been married for 18 years but had been living separately for seven.

Turkington had never been in trouble with the police before

Elizabeth Nicholls, for Victoria Turkington said that she had pleaded with her husband to stop and even stood in front of the nurse to protect her.

Sentencing Turkington, Judge Peter Openshaw said: 'Over the years he had developed an interest in weapons. He developed considerable skill in loading these weapons with ammunition and turned them into deadly weapons.

'It does not follow, therefore, that the events of the 25th May took place in isolation. He was making this arsenal of prohibited weapons.

'On this occasion he became fixed on the idea of suicide to the point where he cared about nothing else.

'I am willing to accept that he did not intend to shoot other people, but to shoot himself or to create a credible risk for the police to shoot him. It is all very well to claim the incident did not last long. His conduct put many people at risk and the outcome could have easily been very different.

'I cannot say that after serving two thirds of his sentence he would no longer pose a risk. I therefore pass a life sentence.'

Of Victoria Turkington he said: 'I am 
quite prepared to find that there are extraordinary and exceptional 
circumstances for my not sending her to prison for five years.

'What she did, as she herself well knows, was profoundly wrong.

'A
 prison sentence must be passed and I am unable to suspend it. A message
 must plainly go out that anyone who does possess or move weapons in 
this way must face unpleasant consequences. I reduce her sentence to two
 years imprisonment.'

Box with bullets in: Fearing impending Armageddon, Turkington had stockpiled tents and tins of food at his Salford home, as well as explosive manuals and chemicals, and had crafted 218 bullets himself

Bullets recovered from Turkington: He later said of the hand wound that he doesn't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets

Detective Chief Inspector Ben Ewart said: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for three members of staff caught up in this incident, not least the nurse who was kept near Turkington for the best part of ten minutes.

'At some point or another, each of these people thought their life was in danger and that Turkington could lose control.

'Not only were they worried about themselves, but also the other patients on the ward.

'Despite these trying circumstances, however, the victims remained calm and compliant to ensure Turkington's anxiety levels did not increase and they all showed extreme bravery throughout their ordeal.

'As for Turkington himself, our detailed investigations uncovered an alarming pattern of behaviour and a concerning level of interest in warfare.'
