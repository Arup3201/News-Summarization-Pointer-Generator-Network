A 33-year-old single mom claims to have been drugged and sexually abused by a 72-year-old Long Island millionaire who took her and her son in after they lost everything in Hurricane Sandy.

According to a lawsuit filed in Queens Supreme Court, horse trainer Francesa Riccardi charges that Frank Villano - a prominent New York businessman who owned Mickey Mantle's and Solera restaurants in Midtown - would lace oatmeal with Ambien and Xanax before abusing Riccardi as she slept.

Villano, a divorced father-of-four, was a friend of Riccardi's mother, the New York Post reported.

The suit claims the abuse was witnessed by Riccardi's 10-year-old son, who would be in the same bed as his mom inside Villano's $3 million Glen Head mansion when the alleged acts were taking place.

Single mom Francesca Riccardi claims to have been abused by Frank Villano while staying at his Long Island mansion as a guest between November 2012 and January 2013. She said she was alerted to the alleged acts by her 10-year-old son, who was sleeping in the same bed as her and witnessed what was going on

Frank Villano is the owner of restaurants Mickey Mantle's and Solera in Midtown, New York. He is accused of sexually abusing Francesca Ricardi, 33, while she stayed at his home in Glen Head, Long Island

Francesca Riccardi, a horse trainer, is seeking unspecified damages from Frank Villano, claiming he drugged her and  sexually abused her at his house

'Villano would enter their room, disrobe Riccardi in her sleep, and put his hands on her body,' the suit claims.

'Villano would even kiss her face and moan while he was molesting her.'

Riccardi - who lost all her belongings when the Staten Island apartment she was living in was flooded by Hurricane Sandy - said she was alerted to the abuse by her son.

On January 2, 2013, she didn’t take the pills.

Villano came into her room at 2am and sexually assaulted her, she claims, adding that she screamed and pushed him off.

Riccardi then moved out and filed complaints with Nassau County cops.

However, Villano was not arrested or charged.

Villano’s lawyer, Aida Leisenring, called Riccardi a 'gold digger' and said the complaint was 'ridiculous' and 'a complete lie'.

'It’s transparent that she wants money,' Leisenring said.

In court papers, Villano says they had 'consensual sexual contact'.

Horse trainer Francesca Riccardi claims Frank Villano was 'obsessed' with her and hired a private detective to follow her every move. Villano says the claims are lies and that she is only after money

However Riccardi says Villano - who has founded several businesses, including a software company that served Fortune 100 clients - was 'obsessed' with her.

He threatened to make her life 'a living hell' if she ever moved out and allegedly told her: 'You belong to me and nobody else.'

The suit claims Villano installed a GPS tracking device on a car he loaned Riccardi, sent her 930 texts, called her incessantly and stole her AOL password in an attempt to cut her ties with an ex-boyfriend.

Villano posed as Riccardi and told the ex via online exchanges that she planned to marry Villano, the suit says.

The sleeping and anti-anxiety pills Villano is accused of administering to Riccardo were prescribed to him, the suit says.

Riccardi and her son moved first in with Villano in November 2012.

Francesca Riccardi is seeking unspecified damages for the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Frank Villano, a New York businessman and restaurateur

Riccardi, who now lives in Queens with her son, seeks unspecified compensation and punitive damages.

In 2007 Villano received a Distinguished Alumni Award by Long Island University.

In 2005, he donated $1 million to a Greenwich Village child-protection center.

'He acted like a father figure,' said Riccardi’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina.

'This was despicable conduct by a guy who knew Francesca was traumatized by Hurricane Sandy and took advantage of her.'
