A whistleblower who claims staff cut corners while vetting security staff for the London Olympics was escorted from her place of work.

Data input clerk Sarah Hubble was interviewed by bosses, then told not to return after contacting the media about her experiences working for G4S.

Miss Hubble, 27, from Darlington, County Durham, claimed the system was creaking under the pressure of processing thousands of applications ahead of this summerâ€™s games.

She said staff had to process a minimum of ten applications an hour and that the documents ended up piled in corners at the office in Stockton-on-Tees.

She said: 'It was an absolute shambles - you had people vetting potential employees who had not been vetted themselves.'

Miss Hubble said that despite having access to personal information, including passport details, bank account information, national insurance cards, driving licenses and identity cards, she had never had a criminal records check herself.

After the report was screened on the television news, Miss Hubble, who was employed through employment agency Reed, said she was quizzed for two-and-a-half hours by several G4S directors.

After initially denying she contacted the media, Miss Hubble said she admitted it was her when the company found evidence of her contact with a journalist on her phone, which bosses examined in detail.

G4S said the company took the integrity of its screening and vetting very seriously and investigated any alleged breach immediately.

A spokesman said the firm did not comment on individual cases.

However, he added: 'We are aware of the false allegations made by an individual who was temporarily engaged through a local employment agency to carry out data entry at our Stockton screening centre.'

Reed said it had not dismissed Miss Hubble.
