A McDonald's customer spotted a horde of mice feasting on leftover burgers and chips outside one of the chain's restaurants.

James Jarvis, 26, saw the rodents scurrying near the bins of the fast-food store as he approached the drive-through in Tyburn, Birmingham on Saturday night.

The factory worker, who had stopped to pick up a meal on his way home from his son's fifth birthday party, was so shocked that he took photos of the mice to show McDonald's staff.

Mr Jarvis spotted around seven of the rodents as he visited the restaurant's drive-through on Saturday night 

The factory worker said he saw about seven of them coming out of a gated area as he approached the drive-through window 

McDonald's has since blamed the mice on 'extensive' roadworks taking place nearby.

Mr Jarvis, from Edrington, Birmingham, said: 'We spotted one of them as we were coming up to the first drive-through window.

'Before we knew it there were five, six, seven of them coming out from a gated area. It was disgusting.

'I'm not sure if that's where they keep the bins but it's not right to have mice roaming around near a fast food restaurant where there are kids about.

'I mentioned it to the young assistant at the window and she said the manager knew about the problem and had put traps down.

'I told her it clearly wasn't working and wasn't good enough.'

McDonald's has blamed the mice on roadworks taking place near to the restaurant and says the store has increased the number of traps on site (pictured) 

As well as providing more traps, a spokesman for the chain said it has increased litter patrols around the restaurant and requested weekly inspections

The McDonald's branch is near an £11million road improvement project which is aiming to reduce congestion on a busy stretch of the Chester Road, which is used by 40,000 vehicles a day.

A McDonald's spokesman said the company had increased the number of traps, litter patrols and inspections at and around the restaurant.

He said: 'We can assure our customers that cleanliness and hygiene are a priority for us and we adhere to high standards with independent, strict and regular audits to ensure food safety.

'There is currently extensive roadworks taking place in close proximity to our restaurant and on occasion, pests have been sighted in the area disturbed by the development works.

'We continue to work closely with our contractors to monitor the area.

A spokesman said the restaurant was visited last week by Environmental Health and that  there was no evidence of pest activity inside the store

'We have increased litter patrols around the restaurant, requested weekly inspections and provided more traps.

'The restaurant was visited last week by Environmental Health that observed there was no evidence of pest activity inside the store.'

In Birmingham last year, there were more than 5,100 sightings of rodents recorded.

City pest control officer Colin Watts said in March that he had even seen a rat the size of a cat in Bordesley Green.

He said: 'One of the biggest I've seen must have been 14 or 15 inches long. That was just the body, without the tail. With its tail it would have been over 2ft. It was like a small cat.'
