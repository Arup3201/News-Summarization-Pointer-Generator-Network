At first glance, Myrtle Avenue, with leafy gardens in pleasant semi-detached houses seems like a suburban idyll.

But appearances can be deceptive as the street, located in the London borough of Hounslow, is believed to be one of the noisiest in Britain - as it's just a stone's throw from Heathrow Airport.

The road is one of the closest streets to the airport's busy southern runway at just 100 yards from the airport perimeter, with planes regularly flying low over the houses as they jet off and come in to land.

Currently
 there are around 1,280 arrivals flights coming in and out of Heathrow 
every day, mostly between 6am and 11pm, with the airport alternating the
 runway used by landing aircraft in a bid to provide noise relief for 
those living nearby. Airlines are also fined if their planes breach 
noise restrictions set at 94 decibels during the day, and 87 at night.

A
 Heathrow spokesman said: 'We recognise that as well as bringing huge 
benefits to the UK and the local communities, an airport of the size and
 importance of Heathrow can have downsides for people living nearby.

'We
 are taking significant steps to tackle noise; we encourage airlines to 
fly only their quietest aircraft into Heathrow, charge airlines more for
 noisier aircraft and have schemes to insulate local properties. We are 
committed to reducing the impacts of noise further and will continue to 
work with local residents to do this.'

Noise pollution: The leafy and picturesque street is just a short distance away from the perimeter of the busiest airport in Europe

What a view: The view of the runway from the end of the street means it is a popular spot for plane enthusiasts to watch the aircraft take to the skies

Precautions: Airlines are fined if their planes breach noise restrictions, which have been set at 94 decibels during the day, and 87 at night to protect those living nearby

Plans
 for a third runway would enable Heathrow to handle 260,000 more flights
 a year, but the good news for residents in Myrtle Avenue who might be 
reaching for the ear plugs at the prospect is that the shortlisted 
proposals place the new runway to the north west of the airport.

The
 road's views of both runways make it a popular base for plane spotters,
 who come from around the world to watch the world's largest planes 
landing on one of the two runways at Heathrow, the busiest airport in 
Europe.

Peter Graham, 71, told the BBC the plane spotters' cars block the road back and residents often can't get out.

Meanwhile Himesh Patel, 22, who has lived on the street his entire life, said: 'Sometimes I have beeped the horn on my car for an hour to get their attention and find out who is blocking the driveway.'

The
 aviation enthusiasts bring chairs, blankets, picnics and cameras with 
long lenses, so they can enjoy the massive aircraft coming in to land 
and taking off in comfort.

Plane
 spotter Gerhard came from Austria to see the spectacle: 'I think there 
is no place in Europe where you can get so many planes landing in such a
 short time, so it's a special place here,' he told the Telegraph.

Despite
 the noise and disruption, the houses are still worth an estimated 
average £276,946, because of the site's proximity to the capital.
