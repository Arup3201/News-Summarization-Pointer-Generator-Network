Coming in to land: The 21-year-old Chinese man made a dramatic landing at Mangalore Airport, north of Melbourne this morning

Testing times: He was forced to circle the airport for several hours to burn off fuel, but touched down without damaging the plane

Spin: The plane did a 180 degree turn when it hit the runway

The student, who has not yet been identified, had just 120 hours flying time, and noticed there was problem with the wheels as he took off at 9am this morning.

After reporting his concern to his instructor he was told to fly near the airport so a visual inspection could be done.

That was when it became clear that one of the three wheels had fallen off the single-engine Piper Warrior.

The trainee pilot was then forced to circle for five hours to burn off the fuel.

Safety: A fire engine sprayed the aircraft with foam when it landed at the airport to ensure it would not catch alight

Then when it was decided the fuel was low enough, he was guided to landing by his flight instructor using a two-way radio, speaking in his native language.

Police, aviation safety authorities 
and emergency services were on standby at the airport as the aircraft 
missing its back right-hand wheel, touched down at Mangalore Airport 
about 1.20pm.

There was concern that a sudden impact could led to a crash and the remaining fuel could catch alight.

As it hit the runaway the plane lurched, turned 180 degrees and then came to a sudden stop in the dust.

The pilot remained in the cockpit as emergency crews poured more foam on the plane to prevent a fire.

He was then helped from the plane by a member of the emergency services and led to an ambulance - he was not hurt.

Acting Sen-Sgt Clayton Munro told the Herald Sun at the scene: 'It was an excellent landing.'

Assistance: The student was taken from a plane by a member of the awaiting emergency services

Survival: As he walked across the airfield the student looked back at the aircraft
