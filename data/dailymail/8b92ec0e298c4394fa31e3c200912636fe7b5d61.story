The popularity of The Great British Bake Off could be putting keen home bakers at risk of asthma triggered by flour dust, warn experts.

Some 3,000 people – many of them professional bakers – develop occupational asthma each year.

Charity Asthma UK has warned that amateurs who catch the baking bug from the BBC show could be next.

The warning follows new data showing flour has been identified as the main cause of occupational asthma in France.

It was the trigger for one in five cases of the condition in a nation famed for its baguettes, says a study presented at the European Respiratory Society's International Congress yesterday. 

Occupational asthma usually results from breathing in substances known as 'respiratory sensitisers' over a period of time at work. In some people, these substances cause asthma symptoms.

This can lead to severe chronic asthma if exposure to the sensitiser continues.

In the UK, the top cause of occupational asthma is a group of chemicals called isocyanates used in spray painting, foam moulding and metal casting.

Dust from flour and grain is another major cause, mainly affecting bakers, farm workers and grain transporters.

But home bakers could be at risk, said Samantha Walker, Director of Research and Policy at Asthma UK.

Babies who sleep on fur are less likely to develop asthma, say scientists.

Early exposure cut the risk by up to three-quarters, a German study found.

Infants who slept on animal fur for three months had extra protection until at least age ten.

It is believed the practice primes the immune system for later life, the researchers said at the European Respiratory Society’s International Congress.

Dr Walker said: 'Baking is not only a career but it is also a hobby enjoyed by millions of people in the UK, as we have seen with the popularity of the Great British Bake Off, and this study highlights just how important it is that occupational asthma is taken seriously.

'An estimated 3,000 new cases are reported in the UK each year and bakers are about 80 times more likely to develop occupational asthma than the average worker due to exposure to flour and other bakery dusts.

'We urge anyone who regularly bakes, or who is a baker by profession, and who has experienced breathing problems to discuss these with their GP.' 

The French study, the largest of its kind in the country, looked at 330 cases.

Flour dust was blamed for 20 per cent of these, while ammonium compounds often found in cleaning products caused 15 per cent.

Women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed than men.

Rates were higher among skilled and unskilled workers (116 per million) when compared with farmers (97 per million).

The highest rate was found in people working in the manufacture of food products and beverages, with 279 cases per million people.

Professor Frederic De Blay, lead author from the University Hospital Strasbourg, said 'This study has given us a detailed understanding of the occupational asthma cases in France.

'It helps to show us where people are being exposed to harmful agents and who is most likely to be affected.

'These findings are important as they can help with future prevention methods to make sure people who are at risk of occupational asthma are protected from it.'
