Premier League footballer Jermaine Pennant has been spared jail despite admitting drink-driving while he was banned from the roads.

It was the winger's third offence, yet he has avoided a prison sentence after the judge accepted that he was 'depressed and stressed' after months of turmoil in his private life.

The Stoke City player was more than 
twice the limit when he got behind the wheel of his BMW to drive back 
from Manchester in the early hours of April 29, a court was told.

The £40,000-a-week winger, 29, smashed his £93,000 BMW into another car and sent it into a 360 degree spin after a late-night drinking session.

Later Pennant said he did not realise he had been banned from driving and had only driven home after he had been dumped by a girlfriend and a clubgoer began taunting him about it, Trafford Magistrates' Court heard.

He had already been convicted of 
drink driving in 2004 then the following year was jailed for a 
drink-driving smash, following which he falsely identified himself as 
fellow footballer Ashley Cole.

Today Pennant, from Sandbach, Cheshire, admitted drink driving, driving while disqualified and having no insurance.

He was given an eight-week prison 
term suspended for a year and was banned from driving for three years 
after the footballer insisted he was a 'disciplined and mature person 
who had now grown up'.

Pennant had been playing football 
earlier that day and had arranged for his estranged partner Lara Murphy 
and their 20-month-old son, Trey, to come and see the game but they 
did not turn up.

Judge Khalid Quereshi said he accepted Pennant may have had 'pressures due to being in the public eye.'

But Carol Whittingham from the 
Campaign Against Drink Driving said after the hearing: 'This sounds like
a case of me, me me and of a man who gave no thought or disregard to 
other human beings when he got behind the wheel of his car whilst drunk.

'It's bad enough that he has 
convicted of one drink driving offence but to be convicted three times 
just shows how volatile and immature this man really is.

'People
like him should stop moaning about their life in the spotlight and work
with charities like us so they can see first hand the terrible and 
tragic effects drink driving can have on people's lives.

'My
son was killed by a drink driver yet here is this man complaining that 
he went drink driving because he was under stress due to his love life 
and being in the public eye.

'He
needs to get his priorities right and he should at the very least have 
recieved a short prison sentence and a ten year ban to make sure he 
learns his lesson.'

The court 
heard how he had begun a relationship with another woman last year but 
that 'comments made by the Press and on Twitter' meant it was 'doomed 
from the beginning'.

Mike 
Stephenson, defending, told how an already distressed Pennant returned 
home after the match only to find that his new girlfriend, Alice Goodwin, had left with 
all her belongings.

He also discovered a text on his phone telling him the relationship was over.

Mr Stephenson added: 'He was home alone depressed and stressed.'

Mr
Stephenson said Pennant's friends invited him out and he ended up in a 
nightclub in Manchester - but there were further problems.

'Whilst
in that nightclub, a certain individual in that club was making certain
comments about his former partner, very personal comments.

'I don't want to mention in open court with the Press here, but it was a very distressing thing they both suffered.'

Mr Stephenson said Pennant's telephone then began to ring with people calling him about the comments and to ask him 'if this was true'.

'That was the straw that broke the camel's back,' Mr Stephenson added.

'All the hotels were full. He got into his car and drove home to a place of safety.'

Pennant, who was disqualified from driving at the time of the incident, claimed he had 'no idea' because of a mix-up over his address.

And he also denied any responsibility for the crash on his way home - and had not faced any charge in relation to that.

Danielle Allanson, prosecuting, told the court Pennant's white BMW was in collision with a silver Audi TT, which was hit side-on and spun round 360 degrees.

Mrs Allanson said the other driver's witness statement described him seeing a 'flash of white' with the other car coming towards him at 'quite a pace'.

'He believed the other car must have gone through a red light to hit him,' Mrs Allanson added. 'He 
was confused and his car filled with smoke and thought it was on fire, 
however he realised the airbags deployed around him. He describes 
returning home and feeling pain in his back and was treated for whiplash
at the hospital.'

Pennant was arrested at the scene standing near to his car and was 
making a phonecall. Tests revealed he had 89 microgrammes of alcohol in 
100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

The other driver was treated in hospital for whiplash.

Police were quickly on the scene and Pennant was arrested and taken to the local police station.

The court heard he was convicted of drink driving in February 2004 and 
given 16 months disqualification. On March 1 2005 he was jailed for 
three months for drink driving and driving while disqualified and later 
made history as the first professional footballer to play a match whilst
wearing an electronic tag.

Then in April the year Pennant was convicted in his absence of failing 
to identify the driver of a car involved in a motoring offence and was 
banned again under a totting up procedure.

But in mitigation defence lawyer Mr Michael Stephenson said the 
footballer had no idea he had been banned from driving as a legal notice
had been sent to his old address in Altrincham and he had never 
received it.

Mr Stephenson added: 'Jermaine Pennant had a difficult and unsettling 
childhood and his early twenties can only be described as wayward.

'But over the last seven years he has matured, disciplined himself as a 
person and as a professional footballer. He takes his employment 
seriously and has maintained the discipline required to be a 
professional footballer.'

Passing sentence the judge said: 'Everyone who drives a vehicle has to take responsibilities. I accept that it was not a knowing offence and he is to be given the benefit of the doubt.

'I hear what you say about his personal problems and have sympathy that people in the public eye have pressures and appreciate the pressures put on relationships but with that notoriety comes further responsibilities.'

He told Pennant: 'You are the author of your own misfortune. I accept it wasn't a pre-planned decision to drive but it was your choice and no other.

'You are of low risk of reconviction and low risk of causing harm to the public. You are genuinely remorseful.'

In 2007, Pennant began dating glamour model Amii Grove but went he beserk and was arrested after she dumped him upon finding CCTV footage of the footballer cheating on her. He was said to have 'taken revenge by destroying £200,000 of his designer gear'.

He recently made headlines again when his Porsche was found abandoned at a railway station in Zaragoza, Spain with several months worth of parking tickets.
