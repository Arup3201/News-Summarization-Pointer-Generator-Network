As Sir Dave Brailsford said this week, ‘the best sports people in the world aren't normal people’.

Brailsford was talking in the context of the Kevin Pietersen controversy but he just as easily could have been referring to the author rivalling the former England batsman for the most explosive new sports book to have come out this week on a Monday. A certain Roy Keane.

Keane would probably admit to being a man of extremes. Extremely talented, of course. Extremely complex, too.

In Keane's upcoming autobiography he shows a lack of remorse for his tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001

Keane's autobiography, The Second Half

But now there has been time to read beyond those headline-grabbing passages that were initially extracted from The Second Half, there is more depth to Keane than we perhaps might have expected to see.

There is a sense of warmth as well as self-deprecation; a sense of humour as well as candid self-analysis. And an admission to suffering from the same anxieties, the same self-doubt, that trouble most of us at some point in our lives, if not for much of the time.

This is not to ignore some of the of more controversial sections. We will still wince at his response to news of Clive Clarke’s heart attack, just as we will remain uncomfortable with his lack of remorse for that horror challenge on Alf-Inge Haaland. But we will also delight in the score-settling with Sir Alex Ferguson and the brutal, sometimes hilarious, assessment of people he has encountered over the years.

That said, I’ve always believed there is a degree of decency about Keane, even if I was only ever offered the briefest glimpse of his personality as his ghost for a short-lived newspaper column and the occasional interview.

I’d had my fair share of run-ins with him by the time we met in a Bangkok hotel in 2001, where Manchester United were staying on a pre-season tour, to discuss how we would work together.

He had once torn into me for approaching him one morning at the Irish team hotel to request an interview. 

On another occasion for diverting my eyes from his stare, towards a team-mate clowning around behind him, during a conversation in a post-match interview zone. Both times he complained of my bad manners amid a flurry of expletives.

The Irish team hotel incident was one he did return to the following day, approaching me in the same lobby and informing me he was now ready to do the interview.

You wouldn’t call it an apology but it was rather like an incident that appears to have happened at an airport earlier this week. According to a Danish United fanzine editor who contacted me via Twitter, Keane cursed at a guy for taking a picture of him only to then agree to a photograph of them together.

Only recently I ran into a former United coach who only had good things to say about Keane. The coach had been a member of Ferguson’s staff when they won the Treble in 1999, but had not received a Champions League winners’ medal when they were handed out that night in Barcelona. 

Keane thought this was hugely unfair, and gave the coach his.

As a columnist, Keane had a very clear idea of how things were going to work. My only means of contacting him would be by fax. 

He would then reply by text, or occasionally with a call, but always with the number withheld. At a later date, for an interview after his sudden departure from the World Cup in 2002, I was given a home number. But he was quick to point out that, once our business had been concluded, the number would be changing.

If he wasn’t the easiest to get hold of, he remained a dream to work with; even though he was being paid absolute peanuts for doing the fortnightly column. For Keane this particular exercise wasn’t about the money. The opportunity had clearly appealed to him.

It was decided we would always discuss the columns face-to-face, at a hotel in Manchester. And he was never late. If anything, he would be a little early.

And he would never take a drink; even water. After three or four visits to the same hotel bar I insisted he let me buy a round because we could be there for a couple of hours without spending a penny. I bought him a water and he didn’t so much as lift the glass.

The column was terrific. Not least his view on the sudden sale of Jaap Stam to Lazio. He might have been the captain of Manchester United but it did not stop him declaring that players can be treated like ‘pieces of meat’ by their clubs. 

Given that Ferguson’s son, Jason, had been involved in the deal as an agent, that would not have gone down well. Keane didn’t care.

Sadly, after three or four columns I received a call from his lawyer saying he did not want to continue. The reason given was the red card he had received after clashing with Newcastle’s Alan Shearer. 

Keane's column was brilliant - he was fantastic talking about Jaap Stam's departure from United

The piece was stopped as Keane didn't want to continue after clashing with Newcastle's Alan Shearer

He was furious with himself for allowing Shearer to provoke him and was certainly in no mood to reflect on the incident in his next column.

But reading this new book I wonder if he also didn’t like the sense of routine. ‘I don’t like it when companies become too comfortable with me,’ he writes in reference to his television work. ‘I don’t like feeling owned – it tightens the chest. If I’m to be an employee, I want it to be for a club or a football organisation, not in media.’

Beyond his family the game of football is his world, and this new role as deputy to Martin O’Neill and Paul Lambert seems to be one he enjoys. He might be a natural leader but that story of the medal in Barcelona tells you how much importance he stores in a good coach.

As a captain he must have been as inspiring as he could occasionally be terrifying. If Pietersen thinks Matt Prior was an intimidating presence in the dressing room, heaven knows what he would have made of Keane.

But only now, only with the publication of this book, can we even begin to understand what actually makes the man tick.

The media work doesn't do anything for him: 'I don't like it when companies become too comfortable with me'

Keane knows what a good coach means to a team, so will continue his hard work with Ireland and Aston Villa
