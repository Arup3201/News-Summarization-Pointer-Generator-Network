New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has quietly suppressed the public release of a lawsuit to keep untaxed cigarettes out of the city after downplaying those involved in Eric Garner's death, it is claimed.

The groundbreaking suit was reportedly drafted by New York City's Law Department the same week that a grand jury decided not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in the death of Garner.

It was apparently filed in Brooklyn federal court on December 9 in a bid to prevent out-of-state businesses from supplying cigarette traffickers, who can then avoid hefty state and city taxes.

'Suppression': New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured  on The View today with wife, Chirlane McCray (second left) has suppressed the public release of a lawsuit to keep untaxed cigarettes out of the city, it is claimed

Tragic: The suit was reportedly drafted by the city's Law Department the same week that a grand jury decided not to indict a white officer in the death of Eric Garner (left and right, at the time of his death on Staten Island)

Following its filing, the Law Department wrote a press release, claiming the suit 'is the first of its kind brought by the city against an out-of-state entity for supplying cigarette traffickers', it is said. 

But before it could send it out, de Blasio, who criticized the city's police union leaders on 'The View' today, ordered City Hall lawyers to suppress the announcement, sources told the New York Post. 

The Mayor has recently 'minimized' Garner's purchase of illegal cigarettes in Staten Island - a crime that he was being questioned about when he was put in an apparent chokehold by Pantaleo.

Garner, a 43-year-old father of three, died shortly after the incident on July 17. On December 3, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo, sparking protests across the country.

On Hot 97 Radio a day after the verdict, de Blasio said: 'Eric Garner was a decent man. Obviously, it was a minor offense he was committing - there’s no way it should have ended up in this situation.'

Referring to the politician's supposed concealment of the untaxed cigarettes lawsuit, a city official told the newspaper: 'City Hall knew they had screwed up, so they squashed the press release.

'You can’t have the mayor blabbing away that selling loosies is a "minor offense", but then have the Law Department, which represents and protects the city and the mayor’s interests, file this suit.

The official accused de Blasio of 'pander[ing] to his voting base' while realising that illegal tobacco sales are 'a major issue with serious ramifications if left unchecked'.

The civil racketeering suit targets Discount Tobacco & Things of Woodbridge, Virginia, which allegedly sold more than 2,500 cigarette cartons to an alleged Staten Island bootlegger.

If the suit is successful, the business  and its president, Gaby Nouhra, will be barred from distributing cigarettes in New York, and forced to pay back all of its illegal profits and damages.

Nearly 57 per cent of cigarettes smoked in New York are smuggled across state lines - the highest percentage nationwide, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think-tank.

Meanwhile, more than 22 per cent of cigarettes bought in Wyoming are illegally trafficked in - compared to 21.3 per cent of those in Idaho and 21.1 per cent of those in Virginia.

By engaging in such illegal activity, criminals can avoid state and city taxes of $58.50 per carton.

The grand jury decision over Garner's death followed a similar verdict in Ferguson, St Louis, where a secret panel chose not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

Brown, 18, also black, was shot dead on August 9. Some witnesses have claimed he had his arms raised at the time of the incident, while others argue they were by his sides.

Today, de Blasio delivered the latest volley in his ongoing battle with New York's police union leaders, dismissing their ability to speak for their rank-and-file members. 

Ex-president: Bill Clinton today said Garner was doing something illegal but 'didn't deserve to die' on July 17

During his appearance on the daytime talk show 'The View', alongside his wife, Chirlane McCray, the Mayor also criticized the Patrolman Benevolent Association's petition to ban him from future New York Police Department funerals as 'inappropriate'. 

PBA head Patrick Lynch has accused de Blasio of throwing police officers 'under the bus'.

Also today, Bill Clinton has waded into the controversy over the 'chokehold' death of Garner, saying that the unarmed black man 'didn't deserve to die'.

The former president said that there is a 'divide that exists between the people and the police' which needs addressing. 

Tapping into the racial tensions around Garner's death, he added that people have 'preconceptions wired into us and we have got to get beyond them.'

Speaking to news site Fusion, Clinton said: '[Garner] was obviously not well, he was overweight and vulnerable therefore had heart and lung problems.

'He was doing something he should not have been doing. That was illegal. He was selling untaxed cigarettes on the street in small volumes, trying to make a little extra money.

'But he didn't deserve to die because of that.'

MailOnline has requested a comment from de Blasio's office.
