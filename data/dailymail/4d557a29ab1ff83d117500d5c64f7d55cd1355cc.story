Scheme: Igor Borodin has pleaded guilty to buying fake airbags from China and selling them on eBay

A car mechanic has pleaded guilty to trafficking thousands of counterfeit airbags in deals that made him more than $1.4 million dollars in a year.

Igor Borodin, who co-owns an auto shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, allegedly bought an estimated 7,000 fake airbags from China and sold them on eBay between February 2011 and May 2012.

One of the airbags sold by Borodin through eBay was independently tested and failed to inflate properly, court records showed, the Charlotte Observer reported.

The plea comes just two weeks after the U.S. government warned that 'tens of thousands' of drivers who have had airbags replaced in the last three years could be affected by this sort of scheme.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the fake airbags might not deploy in an accident or could explode, sending metal shrapnel into the vehicle's passenger cabin.

'My office will not allow fake airbags to endanger the safety of the drivers in our communities,' U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins said as she announced Borodin's guilty pleas.

'Airbags that do not meet the quality and safety standards of the automobile manufacturers pose a serious threat to human life because they fail to work when they are needed the most â€“ during a car accident.'

As well as trafficking charges, which carries a 10-year prison sentence and a $2 million fine, Borodin faces a delivering hazardous charge, punishable by five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The charge comes after he failed to display the 'hazardous material warnings' on the airbags when they were transported from China to the U.S., as it legally required, court documents states.

Transporting airbags, which are classed as dangerous goods, without the warnings pose a safety risk to anyone transporting and handling them, federal prosecutors said, the Observer reported.

Authorities first investigated Borodin in 2011 when a federal investigation into the sale of the fake airbags in Tennessee found he was involved, court documents said.

They intercepted airbags before taking 20 more after he changed his address. They later searched his home and found 1,514 fake airbags with thousands of dollars in cash, authorities said.

Scene: Borodin was identified as a co-owner of Krugger Auto, where police found fake airbags

They also found 99 of the airbags at his auto shop, Krugger Auto, where he was part owner.

Borodin remains in the Mecklenburg County jail, where he has been since his arrest in August.

It comes after the government warnings against the airbags, which NHTSA testing has shown don't inflate or fail to inflate properly.

In at least 
one case, a counterfeit bag fired shards of metal shrapnel on impact, 
the agency said. No 
deaths or injuries have been tied to the counterfeit bags, it added.

NHTSA
compiled a list of dozens of vehicle makes and models for which 
counterfeit air bags may be available, but the agency cautioned that the
full scope of the problem is not yet clear.

Warning: At a press conference in Washington earlier this month, David Strickland from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned against the spread of counterfeit airbags

Frightening: At the press conference, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton warned the fake airbags can also explode, sending metal shrapnel into the passenger cabin

If a car is
on the list and has had its air bags replaced during the past three 
years by a repair shop other than a new car dealership, NHTSA is asking 
owners to bring the vehicle into a dealership to be inspected at their 
own expense to determine whether the replaced air bags are counterfeit.

Fees
for checking out air bags could run $100 or more, industry officials 
said. Some types of cars have as many as eight air bags.

The counterfeit bags typically have been
made to look like air bags made by automakers and usually include a 
manufacturer's logo. They are marketed to auto shops as genuine.
