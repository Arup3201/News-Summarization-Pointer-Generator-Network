Have you ever looked at photos of your partner's ex, or stalked their work colleagues on Facebook or Twitter? According to new research more than 80 per cent of us do this on a daily basis.

The study, carried out by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, found the average Briton spends a total of 3.5 days a year looking at the profiles of strangers, a practice dubbed 'stranger stalking.'

Men were found to most likely look at random profiles
 of people they find attractive, whilst women were more likely to check 
on potential new partners of their exes - and 14 per cent of Brits admitted to setting up fake profiles to check up on people anonymously.

A study by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, found 80% of people 'stranger stalk' online. Men were most likely to look at random profiles of attractive people, while women regularly checked new partners of exes. Some 14 per cent of Brits admitted to setting up fake profiles to check up on people anonymously

Checking up on ex-partner’s new love interests - 72 per cent

Browsing random profiles of attractive individuals - 64 per cent

Unknown friends and family of partner - 48 per cent

Work colleagues of partner - 27 per cent

Strangers with similar interests (found through Facebook groups or hashtag) - 19 per cent

The site polled a total of 2,704 UK adults - 1,336 females and 1,368 males - aged 18 and over on their specific social media habits whilst online.

Over 80 per cent admitted they regularly looked at the profiles of strangers on sites including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Researchers then asked those taking part in the poll to name the various groups of individuals they would 'stranger stalk' via social media on a regular basis in the order of how often they did so.

Checking up on an ex-partner’s new love interest came top with 72 per cent.

Browsing random profiles of attractive individuals was second with 64 per cent, while half admitted browsing the profiles of unknown friends and family of their partner.

Almost a third said they also look at the work colleagues of their boyfriend or girlfriend.

In last place, 19 per cent of people said they looked at the accounts of strangers with similar interests, found through Facebook groups of hashtags, for example.

Of the respondents who claimed they would check up on their ex-partner’s love interests, the majority, 66 per cent, were women.

Furthermore, of those who said they browse random profiles of attractive people, men were almost three times as likely as women to be doing this on a regular basis. 

When questioned further on their 
habits surrounding 'stalking' their ex partner’s new love interests, 
results revealed 14 per cent admitted to going to extreme lengths and 
creating a fake online profile in order to anonymously look at their 
full profile and pictures.

A
 quarter of respondents confessed that through online views of 
attractive or similarly minded individuals, they had managed to form 
successful romantic relationships in real life.

A quarter of respondents confessed that through online views of attractive or similarly minded individuals, they had managed to form successful romantic relationships in real life

George Charles, spokesperson for VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, made the following comments on the results of the findings:

'When first looking into this study, I must admit I didn’t expect the results to be quite so high, particularly when it came to those admitting they check their ex’s new partner profiles.

'Yet once one takes into account just how many romantic and platonic relationships are formed, and then finish online and over social media, it doesn’t seem as surprising.'

'I think just about everyone who has recently dealt with a break-up can appreciate how overwhelming the temptation can sometimes be not to spend hours and hours scouring the internet for information on how they are dealing with it.

'Having said that, it is of some concern that 14 per cent of respondents admitted to creating fake profiles in order to 'stranger stalk' on social media. I would strongly suggest some of those people log off their computers for now!'
