By the standards of what has been a year of extremes, the past week has been among the better ones for Jonathan Trott. 

First a new contract with Warwickshire and now a call-up to tour this winter with the England Lions.

‘Back in May, as you know, my only focus was playing second-team cricket,’ he told me on Tuesday. ‘It just shows how quickly things can change in sport.’

Trott was buzzing and understandably so. But not because he sees a tour of South Africa as an opportunity to secure a spot for next year’s Ashes. ‘One step at a time,’ he insisted cheerfully.

No, what matters more to Trott right now is the fact that people still believe in him; that his country, as well as his county, think he has a future in the game after the difficulties he endured with a stress-related illness that forced him to leave the last Ashes tour.

‘At 33 it would have been easy for the ECB to simply discard me,’ he said. ‘But they’ve been very supportive all along and I appreciate being given this chance. 

'It’s been the same with Warwickshire. I had a year left on my contract and they’ve given me another three. I have to say I was really pleased they had that confidence with regard to my future.’

Trott earned his selection with some outstanding performances for Warwickshire towards the end of the summer.

He joined the other England players two weeks ago for a screening session at Loughborough and then met with England selector James Whitaker and Warwickshire boss Dougie Brown last week.

By the end of that process the ECB were only too happy to welcome Trott back into the fold, with Whitaker on Tuesday citing his ‘exceptional form and run-scoring exploits for Warwickshire’.

‘I wasn’t playing thinking about an England recall,’ said Trott, who was relaxing at home with his family. ‘After taking that second break from the game in April my only focus was just playing for Warwickshire.

‘But it feels just like it did in 07/08 when I was called into the Lions. I did two tours back then and it aided my development hugely. I spent six weeks in three-star hotels in India but that’s how you earn your stripes.’

Trott has been named in the provisional 14-man squad that will play two first-class matches against South Africa in January, but will not feature in the five one-day matches that follow.

That has led to speculation that he is being considered more for the Test side and possibly the Ashes. Trott, however, urges a bit of caution there.

‘With regards to the one-dayers, because I’ve not been around the set-up for a while I guess I wouldn’t be looked at as someone they could bring in for the World Cup if there was an injury,’ he says. ‘That’s my reading of that one. And I don’t see this particularly as me being on the comeback trail. Everyone who is involved with the Lions will want to play for England and I’ll be no different.

‘Of course I’d like to play in the Ashes. But I also know I’ll have to be in good form to earn that right, and even then the decision still rests with the selectors.

‘Let’s just see how I go. There is no point in setting those goals at the moment. It’s just a case of taking one step at a time. If you think where I was in May, my only focus was on playing second-team cricket again. It’s really important not to get too far ahead and I hope everyone, you guys included, can do the same. I’m just very happy to be where I am right now; looking forward to three more years with Warwickshire and a tour with the Lions.’

Six months ago, as he revealed in a moving interview with this newspaper last month, Trott was in a much darker place. He would go to bed not wanting the night to end, so much did he dread returning to work at Edgbaston the following day.

On Tuesday he was cracking jokes; full of enthusiasm, excited. Such is his modesty, however, he was actually a little stunned by all the fuss over his recall. ‘Is it a slow news day or something?’ he said teasingly. ‘All it will take is Mourinho to say something or Kevin (Pietersen) to tweet something. You see, I’ll be back off the news agenda soon enough.’

It would probably be unwise for him to one day pursue a career as a news editor but in his own mind it would also be a mistake to put too much emphasis on his international recall. It is not the stuff of dreams in his view. 

‘It was a dream when I played my first Test for England,’ he said. ‘But, as I’ve said, I don’t really even want to think about the Ashes at this stage.

Trott's selection follows a number of impressive performances for Warwickshire this season

‘I’m really looking forward to going to South Africa. I love touring and I’m looking forward to playing in Soweto. I’ve not played there before. And I’ll go in with my eyes open, just like I did seven years ago. There will be some training before Christmas but I’ll do some training with Warwickshire before then to make sure I’m ready.’

He will also continue to consult with Dr Steve Peters, the leading sports psychiatrist who has played such an important role in Trott’s return to top-level cricket.

Peters told him he was suffering from ‘situational anxiety’, with Trott relieved to have found someone who finally understood the difficulties he was enduring.

With a far more positive outlook, Trott is also now able to maintain his keen interest in other sports. Last week he took a close friend from the Warwickshire backroom staff to watch the American football at Wembley. Next week he hopes to see Liverpool play against Real Madrid at The Bernabeu.

For a man who only a few months ago wasn’t sure if he wanted to play cricket any more, life would appear to be good.
