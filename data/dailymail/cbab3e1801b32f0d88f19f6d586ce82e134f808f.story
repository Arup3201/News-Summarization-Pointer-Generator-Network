Resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove-grey silk and a striking Phillip Treacey fascinator, the Duchess of Cornwall looked every inch the royal bride when she married Prince Charles in 2005.

Now the Duchess' stunning Anna Valentine gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening next Spring at the V&A.

What's more, the Duchess of Cornwall wasn't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show.

Also included is the flesh-flashing Pam Hogg frock worn by Lady Mary Charteris to her 2012 marriage to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze, and a truly spectacular white silk-satin gown with an 18ft train sported by Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, on her big day in 1933.

Other highlights include the dip-dyed pink and ivory John Galliano-designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani to her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale and the unusual purple silk frock in which Dita von Teese married shock-rocker Marylin Manson.

The gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for the exhibition, entitled Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014, which opens in May.

According to curators, the exhibition will trace the development of the fashionable white wedding dress, which, as some might be surprised to discover, wasn't always the most popular choice.

'The wealthiest women in the 18th century tended to wear fabrics woven with metal thread,' Edwina Ehrman, the show's curator, told the Telegraph.

'White was a secondary choice, and not because of any associations with chastity. It showed status because it was expensive to have a white dress.'

Typical of the wedding frocks worn in the 18th century is the ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy woman named Jane Bailey to her 1780 marriage to James Wickham.

Equally impressive is the lavishly frilled, embroidered and furbelowed dress sported by New York heiress Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers at her wedding to Bradford Ferris Duff in 1890.

But although cream and pale shades of gold and yellow proved popular with 18th century brides, white didn't truly become de rigeur until well into the next century.

'Really though, the only difference between a wedding dress and a fashion dress was the trimmings,' added Miss Erhmann.

'After they were married, brides would take the trimmings off and wear it again.'

Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014 opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from next May and runs until March 2015.
