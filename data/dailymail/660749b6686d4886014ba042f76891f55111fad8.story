A prestigious New York art school confiscated a fridge full of sperm from a student's art show after deciding it was a health and safety risk.

'Take This Sperm and Be Free of Me' involved Marc Bradley Johnson displaying 68 vials of his semen in a fridge and inviting visitors to take a vial home with them from Manhattan's Visual Arts Gallery.

Johnson said that the vials represented 'creation, parenting, desire, masculinity, fantasy, and reality', but his art school was less than impressed, calling it 'bio-hazardous waste'

Health Hazard: Artist Marc Bradley Johnson's art work involving giving away sperm to the public did not impress his art school

Johnson, a 23-year old student, said that he took precautions before his debut last Friday, agreeing to microwave the 
samples before displaying them to the public: 'The semen is dead. The swimmers are not swimming'.

Johnson protested that he had shown the work many times in class and that there was 'plenty of bio-hazardous work in the art world' in any case.

I've been working on this for months,' Johnson complained to the Daily Intelligencer.

The day after the fridge went on show, Johnson received an e-mail from the art school's director of environmental health and safety, John 
DeLuca.

DeLuca said that after he had checked with a biomedical scientist, he realised that there was 'no 
way to ensure the sperm samples would be 100 percent free of pathogens.'

He added: 'In order to protect the public we will need to secure the refrigerator until I 
can arrange to have the sperm samples disposed of as hazardous 
biowaste.'

The semen was then quarantined as a health hazard in an administrator's
office until a waste-management firm could dispose of it.

Eventually the university called off the professional disposal after Johnson claimed it was censorship.

The art school and Johnson reached a compromise by agreeing that the refrigerator would be sealed and the vials would not be available to take away.

Johnson's work also proved controversial last year when he paraded around New York dressed as Jesus Christ, for a piece entitled 'The Narcissim of God'.
