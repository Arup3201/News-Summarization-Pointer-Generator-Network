A cancer patient who convinced supporters including Justin Bieber and Jay Leno to post online photos copying his trademark 'muscle' move has died.

Zach Lederer from Baltimore, Maryland battled brain cancer for nine years and inspired millions of people across the globe with his defiant message.

The University of Maryland student posted an online photograph of him flexing his muscles and named the pose 'Zach-ing'. Thousands of people across the globe have followed his example in support of people with cancer.

The 20-year-old student was told by doctors at the world famous Johns Hopkins Memorial Hospital in 2012 that his parents should take him home and make him comfortable as he might not survive the night.

However, he managed to fight the disease for another 12 months. He died on Tuesday at his parent's home in Ellicott City according to the Baltimore Sun.

Mr Lederer told supporters during his efforts to beat the illness: 'Let's win this war. Hope is stronger than cancer'.

A message on his Facebook page posted hours after his death read: 'Thank you to everyone for your outpouring of love and support. It was important to Zachary Lederer to help others battling cancer and other serious illnesses. Please post the name of someone you know that could use some "ZACHING".(in the comment section below) I think Zach would like that. Thank You.'

He said: 'His signature fist-pumping gave hope not only to those in medical situations, but also to those in life who had other problems. They had to think, "If he can do it, I can".'

Dr Carson, a retired paediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins added: 'He was so encouraging to them. Zach had courage and was absolutely fearless as he went through all of the treatments. He was able to put it out of his mind and go forward.

'We radiated the tumor and it completely 
melted away. We kept in touch through the years, and 
Zach has the most wonderful and supportive family, which made a great 
difference in his prognosis.'

Mr Lederer was 11 when he was first diagnosed with brain cancer. Prior to one operation, he was warned that he was going to be placed in a medically induced coma that he might not wake up from.

His mother Christine said in an interview in 2010: 'After Zach came out of the coma, he could do absolutely nothing but blink. Zach had physical therapists, occupational therapists and cognitive therapists.

'He had some trouble with memory, and he had to learn to write again,' she told the Baltimore Sun.

She added: 'Zach ate and breathed sports. He loved school, was successful academically and in the National Honor Society. He loved doing service and worked on the Special Olympics. He tutored kids at high school.'

Mr Lederer will be buried following a service on March 21 near his home in Ellicott City.
