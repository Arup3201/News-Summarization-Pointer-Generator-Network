Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck picked up an ankle knock in England training at London Colney on Tuesday but could still be fit enough to play some part against Norway.

The Three Lions welcome Per-Mathias Hogmo's side to Wembley on Wednesday for their first game since being knocked out in the group stage of this summer's World Cup.

Roy Hodgson has refused to rule Welbeck out of the friendly, but his injury means that he is likely to begin the match on the bench.

Knock: Danny Welbeck injured his ankle in England training on Tuesday but could still play against Norway

Calm before the storm: Welbeck, pictured training on Monday, later completed a deadline day move to Arsenal

In the frame: Welbeck's injury means that he looks likely to start on the bench at Wembley on Wednesday

The 23-year-old, who made a £16million deadline day switch from Manchester United to Arsenal, looks likely to be available for England's first Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Hodgson is a big admirer of the versatile striker and he will be keen to ensure that Arsene Wenger's latest signing is fully fit for Monday evening's clash in Basle.

Welbeck started England's opening two games in Brazil as they lost 2-1 to both Italy and Uruguay. He was substituted in both matches and played no part in the dead rubber against Costa Rica. 

Fresh start: Welbeck will get down to work at Arsenal after the international break having signed for £16million

All smiles: Welbeck shares a joke with his then team-mate Wayne Rooney during England training on Monday
