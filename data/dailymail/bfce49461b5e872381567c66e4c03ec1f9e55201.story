Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chavez mocked the U.S. and joked about directing 'a big atomic bomb' at Washington as they met in Caracas today.

The president of Iran was visiting his Venezuelan counterpart in an attempt to rally support for his government in the face of tightening sanctions from the West.

His meeting with Mr Chavez came on the day that Iran sentenced a man to death for allegedly spying on the country for the U.S., and claimed to have arrested several more American spies.

And the country has also sparked anger by beginning to enrich uranium at a secret underground site - a move which could be a step further towards developing a nuclear bomb.

Mr Ahmadinejad is in Venezuela at the start of his tour of Latin American countries ruled by left-wing governments sympathetic to Iran's virulently anti-western regime.

As international sanctions begin to bite on Iran's oil-dominated economy, the president is looking for allies who can continue to provide an economic lifeline for his government.

'Despite those arrogant people who do not wish us to be together, we will unite forever,' he told Mr Chavez today.

Both men hugged, beamed, held hands and showered each other with praise, making macabre jokes which appeared to threaten the U.S., the principal enemy of both leaders.

Outspoken: The men joked about targeting Washington with 'a big atomic bomb'

Mr Chavez said that he was hiding a bomb under a grassy knoll before the steps of the presidential palace, saying: 'That hill will open up and a big atomic bomb will come out.'

As the two men laughed, he added: 'The imperialist spokesmen say Ahmadinejad and I are going into the basement now to set our sights on Washington and launch cannons and missiles... It's laughable.'

During a welcome ceremony for Mr Ahmadinejad, the speeches were mostly limited to mutual adulation and anti-U.S. snipes.

Mr Chavez said: 'The imperialist madness has been unleashed in a way that has not been seen for a long time.'

Mr Ahmadinejad called his host, who is recovering from cancer, 'the champion in the war on imperialism'.

And discussing the two countries' 
co-operation, Mr Chavez said that Iranian constructors had recently 
built 14,000 new homes in Venezuela, adding: 'The only bombs we're 
preparing are bombs against poverty, hunger and misery.'

Friendship: The two men are united in their hatred of the U.S., which Mr Chavez has accused of being responsible for a number of South American leaders falling ill with cancer

U.S. officials have expressed disquiet over Venezuela's close ties with Iran. They fear Mr Chavez will weaken the international diplomatic front against Iran and could give Tehran an economic lifeline.

The United States and its allies believe Iran's nuclear policy - which has taken a step forward with the opening of the underground Fordow facility near Qom - is aimed at producing a weapon. Iran says it is only for peaceful power generation.

As well as Venezuela, Mr Ahmadinejad plans to visit Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador on a visit that Washington has said shows its 'desperation' for friends.

Those nations' governments share Mr Chavez's broad global views, but do not have Venezuela's economic clout and are unable to offer Iran any significant assistance.

Analysts are watching closely to see if Mr Chavez will back Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil shipping lane, or how much he could undermine the sanctions by providing fuel or cash to Tehran.

Ahmadinejad, who is subordinate to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on foreign policy, has said little about the rising tensions with the West, including the sentencing to death of 28-year-old Iranian-American Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, who is accused of spying for the CIA.
