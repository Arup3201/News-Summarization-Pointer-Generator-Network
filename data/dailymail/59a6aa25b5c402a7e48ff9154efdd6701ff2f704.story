Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld thrashed their English counterparts Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis to clinch the World Cup of Darts for the Netherlands in Hamburg.

The Dutch pair were far too strong in the final and moved into an unassailable 3-0 lead, not requiring the last two games.

World champion Van Gerwen kicked off the final with a 4-0 win over Taylor before Van Barneveld thrashed Lewis by the same margin.

Van Gerwen then sealed World Cup glory to add to his World Championship success when he brushed aside Lewis 4-2 in Germany.

‘This is a very special moment for us,’ Van Gerwen said. ‘This is a fantastic title because I've never won this, and we worked very hard for this.

‘I enjoyed every moment of the tournament and to win the final against England is amazing for us and I think we deserved the title because we worked so well as a team.

‘We played really well today, especially against Belgium and Ireland in the Doubles games, and then we walked over England in the final with some awesome darts.

‘I started off very well against Phil and to win 4-0 and for Raymond to beat Adrian 4-0 was very good for our confidence, and I knew I had to turn up against Adrian. I did that and we won the title, and we'll enjoy this moment.’
