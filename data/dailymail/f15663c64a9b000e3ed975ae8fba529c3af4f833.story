One in four university students now lives at home with their parents, heralding the end of an era for a generation of school leavers who once dreamed of independence.

In the last decade the number of undergraduates choosing to stay with mum and dad has risen by 50 per cent.

Soaring living costs and a trebling of tuition fees are forcing growing numbers of students to abandon hopes of moving out.

Sign of the times: The proportion of students living with their parents has gone from 20 per cent to 25 per cent in a decade

The cost of being a student has soared in recent years, and can easily top £22,000 including course charges, living costs, rent, food and travel.

The National Union of Students (NUS) says accommodation costs have doubled in the last 10 years, while the coalition has increased tuition fees from £3,000 to up to £9,000-a-year.

The rush in recent years for half of all young people to go to university has increased the pressure, but many find they cannot afford to live away from home.

It suggests some students are being forced to choose to study at universities closer to where they grew up, even if they do not offer their preferred courses.

The increase in tuition fees to up to £9,000-a-year has added to the cost of being a student

Latest figures show that 237,000 undergraduates were living with their parents in 2011-12, compared to 672,000 living away from home.

A similar ratio applies to older students and post-graduates, according to figures published by universities minister David Willetts. In 2002-03, fewer than 20 per cent of students lived at home.

Colum McGuire, NUS Vice President (Welfare), said: ‘More research needs to be done to understand this increase. Some students are choosing different routes into higher education, such as further education colleges, but a rise would not be surprising considering that accommodation costs have doubled in the last decade, and, aside from tuition fees, which have now tripled at many universities, students are also expected to pay out for extra academic expenses.

Former Universities Secretary John Denham said more students should live at home, to save them and the taxpayer money

‘Many students at university are facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials.

‘Students shouldn’t be put in a position where they feel they need to sacrifice going to their ideal university by choosing an institution that is close to home so they can save on their living costs.’

However, it has been claimed that if the expansion of degrees is to continue more students will have to choose to study close to their parents’ home.

John Denham, who was Universities Secretary in Gordon Brown’s Cabinet, said more should be spent on higher education but studying close to home was not necessarily a bad thing.

Mr Denham, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said: ‘The overwhelming expansion in student numbers has been in students living away from home, which is much more expensive for the taxpayer and more expensive for the student.

I think the interesting question this raises is whether we shouldn’t be trying to look at enabling more students to get a high quality education closer to home.

‘Many students feel they have to make themselves financially worse off in order to do the course that they want to do.

‘I think as a country we actually need to spend more of our national wealth and private wealth on higher education than we do at the moment.’
