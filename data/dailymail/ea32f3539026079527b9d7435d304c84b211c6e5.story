Concerns: The damning report shows that President Francois Hollande is facing increasing problems as he looks to streamline the public sector

French public sector workers take an average of nearly a month off beyond annual leave, a damning report has revealed.

The publication highlighted the increasing problems facing President Francois Hollande as he seeks to reduce the country's huge public deficit.

State workers make up one fifth of France's total employed ranks and their salaries account for a quarter of public expenditure.

A report by civil society think tank iFRAP found that local public workers in cities of over 100,000 residents, excluding Paris, missed nearly a month of work on average per year on top of holidays - more than twice the rate in the private sector.

The study calculated public servants in 25 cities missed work an average of 26 days per year, or 12 percent of total work days.

That figure included temporary or long-term illness, work accidents, maternity and paternity leave and unexplained absences.

The highest figures were in the southern city of Montpellier, with an average 39 days of absence, followed by Grenoble and Strasbourg in the east, at 35 and 32 days each.

By contrast, the average equivalent absentee rate at five major companies - Air Liquide, BNP Paribas, Renault, Bouygues and ADP - was just 4 percent.

One of the reasons French employers suggested the figures were so high was that doctors were too ready to issue sick notes.

French absenteeism rates are higher than the European average, according to data from the International Labour Organization.

Some 3.7 million public and private sector employees in France worked 'no hours' in 2012 during one week studied by the ILO versus 4.5 million in Germany, but above the 3.1 million UK employees, 1.9 million in Italy, and 557,000 in Switzerland.

The CGT public servants' union criticised iFRAP's data, claiming it was misleading and did not take into account job functions, the age of workers and varying working environments.

'It's very hard to extract real figures that are representative,' said the CGT's Philippe Vorkaufer.

Pledge: Hollande has promised to find over 50 billion euros in public spending cuts between 2015-2017 to cut taxes

Hollande has promised to find over 50 billion euros in public spending cuts between 2015-2017 to reduce taxes.

If the target is reached it honour a deficit-cutting pledge by the euro zone's second-largest economy to its EU partners.

The EU Commission on Wednesday told France it would miss its targets unless it took action.

Details on where the savings will come from will only be disclosed following local French elections late this month.

The
 ruling Socialist majority is hoping to avoid a backlash from record 
high unemployment and a stagnant economy that have sent Hollande's 
approval ratings plummeting.

Cutting public servants would represent a politically risky move certain to mobilize powerful unions to the streets. It would also further exacerbate the welfare tab by pushing more people into unemployment.

'Any policy of lowering public spending must depend on the two principle spending items: social charges and personnel expenses,' wrote a February study from the liberal Institut Montaigne think tank.

Critics say Hollande's budgetary reform is confused, pointing to his reversal of a key measure begun by predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy designed to curb absenteeism by withholding pay for the first sick day taken.
