We all have memories of twisting pipe cleaners together as children to make stick-figure animals.

However one woman has taken the hobby to a whole new level by turning the fuzzy sticks into extremely detailed models.

Lauren Ryan, an artist from California, has managed to make life-like animals using nothing but pipe cleaners, felt-tip pens and a few plastic buttons.

These incredibly detailed animals are made by Lauren Ryan using only pipe cleaners and strictly no glue, as she considers it cheating. The wolf mask (left), which she made for Halloween, has a mouth that moves when the wearer talks while the red fox (right) has realistic fur thanks to the pipe cleaners' texture

This is an Okapi, a deer-like mammal from central Africa, which was made only using the cleaners, including the stripes around the legs

Her most impressive creation is a full-sized wolf mask she made for Halloween with a moving mouth.

Lauren Ryan, from California, makes the pipe cleaner animals in her workshop and has been practicing since she was 12

Ryan said: 'I gave it complete whiskers and made the jaw able to move when the wearer talks. Unfortunately, I put off sewing and colouring the faux fur until the very end, so it ended up a bit sloppy. But the neighbors' reactions were priceless.'

In fact several of her works are able to move about thanks to special hinges woven into their bodies, and the flexible material they are made from.

Ryan has a passion for animals, and uses her hobby to make sculptures of some of her favourite exotic and endangered species.

She has woven animals from Okapi, 
deer-like mammals found in central Africa, to a Thylacine, the world's 
largest carnivorous marsupial which is thought to be extinct, though 
sightings are still reported across Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea.

She has even made Amaterasu, the wolf-like incarnation of ancient Japanese sun goddess Shinto from the video game Okami.

Writing
on her blog about one of her wolf sculptures, she says: 'I never use 
glue (to me that is like cheating), and only occasionally use scissors. A
little bit of marker colors the eyes, mouth, and paw pads.'

Ryan builds a basic skeleton from 
chenille stems, the technical name for pipe cleaners, before gradually 
building up the layers by weaving others on top to create the full sized
sculptures.

Wolves are a favourite subject fro Ryan, from California, and this starved creature is just one example

This miniature of a wildcat has whiskers made from stripped-down wire and looks especially life-like while perched among this ivy

Ryan constructs skeletons made either from pipe cleaners, for the smaller pieces, or wire, for the larger pieces such as the wolf mask (bottom left) and then builds layers of the furry brushes on top

Because of 
their furry texture, the cleaners make an ideal material for weaving 
animals as it gives their coats a realistic texture.

She
also uses stripped down wires to make whiskers, with projects lasting 
for anything from a few hours for small, basic animals, all the way up 
to several months for the larger beasts.

Discussing
her technique when making a model of a Fennec, a nocturnal fox found in
North Africa, she said: 'Itâ€™s mostly hollow, just the legs, head, and 
tail tip are solid.

While Ryan says she sometimes uses beads for the eyes and felt pens for the markings, she refuses to use glue and considers it cheating

The animal enthusiast enjoys making exotic an endangered animals including these two fennecs, a type of nocturnal fox from North Africa

Ryan holds herself to a very high standard and says she was 'no pleased' with this sculpture because of his ruffled fur

'Usually the more detail required, the tighter an area becomes.

'I generally use the most common pipecleaner size, around 6mm wide, 12 inches long, found in most stores.

'I sort of just smooth them down with my fingers so the wires don't show, and they are tightly woven together.'
