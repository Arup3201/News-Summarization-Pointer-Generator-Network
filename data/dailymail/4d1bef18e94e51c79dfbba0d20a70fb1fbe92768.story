It is one of the world's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children. 

From Julie Andrews waltzing through the Alps to seven children behaving perfectly,  The Sound of Music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants.

But Andrews' real life counterpart - Maria Kutschera - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays.

In fact she was a difficult Austrian woman plagued by insecurities.

Maria Kutschera (centre) was far from the idealized mother The Sound of Music portrays, her son has revealed in a new book

Whereas Julie Andrews (above) waltzed carelessly through the Alps in the 1965 film, Maria was described by her son Johannes as 'incredibly strong' with 'literally an indomitable will'

Her son Johannes has now revealed all in a new book written by Tom Santopietro.

He said: 'She was  incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will. 

'And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.' 

The 75-year-old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child.

Maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train.

By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle.

Maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun.

But while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man, who was left with seven children after his first wife Agatha died of scarlet fever.

That man was Georg von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children.

Georg von Trapp was previously the commander of Austrian submarine U5. He is pictured with his fiancée Agathe Whitehead

The family, including Andrews (centre), perform a song in the film. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children who does not feature in the film, said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that'

It was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing  public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune. 

Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children, often found her mother particularly difficult. 

She said it got worse after her father died in 1947. 

'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it,' Boudicca Fox-Leonard of the Sunday People reported her saying. 

The now 87-year-old said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.'

In real life, after fleeing the country in 1938 the von Trapp's came to rely on their musical performances for money 

She also recounts Maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step-daughter Johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married.

After fleeing the country  in 1938, the family - known as the Trapp Family Singers in the US - came to rely on the performances for money.

The popular film was made after Broadway found a book  detailing the family's adventurers.

Maria later sold the rights  to Hollywood for £3,000.

But director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.'

Even director Robert Wise rebuffed Maria's attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her'

Only three children, none of which feature in the film, survive. The last surviving von Trapp singer died in early 2014. 

Four of the couple's great-grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive.

Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and their younger brother August have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. 

They can remember little of their great-grandmother.  

Sofi said: 'We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group.

'The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.' 

The Sound of Music Story, by Tom Santopietro, is out now.
