Queens Park Rangers have been offered Petr Cech by Chelsea.

The goalkeeper, who has lost his place at Stamford Bridge to Thibaut Courtois, is believed to favour a move to a London club.

Chelsea do not wish to let him join a rival, in either the Barclays Premier League or Europe, but are keen to treat their legendary goalkeeper with respect.

Cech, 32, is said to be keeping his options open on the day the window closes.

The Blues hero is currently in Prague on international duty with the Czech Republic, but a move away from Chelsea is still possible.

Cech would give little away when questioned about his future on Monday, however.

'I've been at the club for 10 years, the situation is now new to me,' he told sport.cz. 'The three opening matches I could not play for the team. I have no reason to panic, pack up and leave.

'I am a Chelsea player, where I have two more years of contract.

Bright future: QPR have already signed England Under 21 keeper Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million

'In football, nothing can be predicted in advance, nothing is ever perfect.

'A lot of players go on representative duty, yet still many transfer clubs.

'The offer would have to be right for everyone. I do not exclude anything (or) know the answer.'

QPR have already signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million and Robert Green is their first choice.

They recently allowed Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Julio Cesar to leave for Benfica. 

Legend: Cech has gone down in history at Stamford Bridge after a glittering career with Chelsea

Appearances: 477

Clean sheets: 220

Trophies:

1x Champions League

1x Europa League

3x Premier League

4x FA Cup

2x League Cup

2x Community shield

It is believed that Cech was offered to QPR last week, ahead of them completing the signing of McCarthy from Championship club Reading. 

Paris Saint-Germain are set to test Cech's resolve to stay in England. They want to bring in the player - as well as Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon - and would prefer to do a loan deal as it would help them in meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions.

PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure.

PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.
