Jurors in the murder trial of Gerard Baden-Clay have been warned about seeking outside assistance during deliberations after one downloaded information on jury deliberations from the internet.

Supreme Court Justice John Byrne recalled jurors from their deliberations on Thursday, two hours after they had retired to consider a verdict.

The judge said a juror had apparently downloaded material on how a jury might approach deliberations.

Brisbane man Gerard Baden-Clay wanted to 'wipe the slate clean' at the time his wife Allison Baden-Clay, pictured together, disappeared in April 2012

'What was done is wrong. I am however grateful that what has happened has been drawn to my attention,' he told the seven men and five women.

Jurors retired to consider their verdict at 11.10am (AEST) on Thursday, on the 18th day of Baden-Clay's trial.

The former real estate agent has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Allison in April 2012.

Her body was found on a creek bank at Anstead in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012, ten days after her husband reported her missing from their home in nearby Brookfield.

Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to murder and the prosecutor at his trial told jurors they might think it 'highly unusual' that Baden-Clay cut himself shaving in a way that looked like fingernail scratches or that Allison's blood was found in the couple's car

During the trial, prosecutors said the father of three probably smothered his wife at their house and dumped her body where it was found under the Kholo Creek Bridge.

Baden-Clay's defence team has argued she could have taken her own life or died accidentally after wandering off at night.

The trial heard from 75 witnesses, including Baden-Clay's former mistress Toni McHugh and Queensland MP Bruce Flegg, who knew Baden-Clay and lived near him.

Allison's parents Geoff and Priscilla Dickie also gave evidence, while recorded police interviews with the couple's three children were played in court.

Details of Baden-Clay's multiple affairs, his financial woes and Allison's history of depression were laid bare during more than four weeks of proceedings.

The judge is expected to finish his summary on Thursday morning before the jury retires to consider its verdict
