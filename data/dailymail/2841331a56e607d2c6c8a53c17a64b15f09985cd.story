A passenger has been pulled of a flight and arrested after he stole the aircraft's megaphone.

Police were called to a WestJet flight that had landed in Saskatoon from Toronto, Canada after cabin crew had noticed the item had gone missing.

After police warned the passengers that all bags would be searched to recover the missing item, a man at the back of the plane, later identified as Jake Michael Piasentini, 29, of Saskatoon, admitted to the theft.

Of all the things to steal, Jake Michael Piasentini, 29, of Saskatoon plunged a megaphone into his bag

Mike Van Dijk, who was on board the WestJet flight, told The Canadian Press: '[They said] that they had lost something.

'And, at first, it kind of seemed like something had fallen off the plane.'

Officers next told everyone that they wanted the thief to come forward.

'You can either tell us who it is right now, or we're going to have to go through all the bags and it's going to take quite a while,' Van Dijk recalled an officer saying.

Alcohol is believed to have played a major part after a Saskatoon resident stole a plane's megaphone

After the item was handed back to aeroplane staff, officers arrested the man, and he is set to appear in court in the next two weeks.

Police revealed the megaphone was stolen from the kitchen area, and alcohol was believed to have been a major factor in the incident. 

Piasentini could be facing a fine of CAD$5,000 ($4,183, £2,747) for theft and a further CAD$5,000 for interfering with a flight. 

A WestJet spokesperson, in an email to News Talk Radio, said there was no danger to the flight at any point during the incident.
