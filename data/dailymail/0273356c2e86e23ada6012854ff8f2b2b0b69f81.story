The internet's most infamous grandma, 86-year-old Baddie Winkle, has long been shocking  Instagram followers as she poses in swimsuits and risqué costumes - but now the octogenarian is looking to pop culture as her cue.

Baddie, who first rose to fame in April last year when she first started up her controversial account, has been transformed into some of the world’s most iconic famous faces, from model Kate Moss to musician Kurt Cobain, as part of a new ad campaign.  

The latest shots, which see Baddie try on a number of guises, were taken by Danielle Levitt to launch Grit's new website, a Brooklyn-based creative agency.

In a nod to both model Kate  and the Nirvana frontman Kurt's famous poses, the senior citizen dons a leopard print coat and is pictured puffing away on a cigarette.

Then she slaps on bangles, heavy black eyeliner and a headscarf to turn into Michelle Lamy, designer Rick Owens' mysterious muse and wife.

Baddie, whose real name is Helen Ruth Van Winkle, became an internet sensation last year after posting age-defying photos online.

The great grandmother from Williamstown, Kentucky, now has more than 646,000 followers.

Her Instagram updates usually include snaps of her smoking or performing other 'bad gal' antics.

While no doubt eager to capitalize on Baddie’s impressive online profile, the agency which commissioned the unique shoot also added that it was her no-nonsense attitude and air of confidence that really made the grandmother stand out as an ideal spokesperson and model. 

'A true firecracker, Baddie first caught out eye on Instagram where the posts pictures of herself wearing tie-dye bathing suits and streetwear while telling off all the haters,’ a spokesperson explained. 

With thousands of followers and fans among the likes of Drake, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, Baddie is an inspiration and proof that energy, hustle and general badassed-ness don’t disappear with age.'

Baddie, who also shares a great deal of video content via her Instagram account, has even been spotted wearing clothing with the slogan 'Stealing your man since 1928' scrawled across it, demonstrating to the world that she isn’t afraid what they think about her.

Earlier this year, she told DailyMail.com that her goals in 2015 were 'to continue to decide to be happy, eat more chocolate, try more new things and do a cool reality series on how to be a baddie!'

The latest set of pictures shows Baddie certainly means business. 

'I have something to look forward to each day and it helps to inspire others young and old. I get to make others laugh and not take life so seriously,' she added to DailyMail.com. 

'I am absolutely amazed about the amount of publicity I have received from my postings. I am blown away but I love it and each day I look to see how many more followers I have received.

'It's a great feeling knowing I'm impacting others lives but in reality the love and sweet words make my life much better. It really helps me more than I am helping others.'
