At first glance this pretty cottage looks very much like any other nestled in the picturesque Welsh valleys.

But this sprawling home comes with its own system of caves, and a lake brimming with trout - all for £450,000.

The secluded property has a network of three caverns and natural rock pools along with 10 acres of land and a stable block big enough for 12 horses.

The Coed-y-Glyn Uchaf cottage, near Glyn Ceiriog, Wales, also includes a former slate mine and has a separate annex with living area.

The Ceiriog Valley is well known for its beautiful countryside and is situated in probably one of the most picturesque areas of North East Wales

At it’s rear, it boasts a gated and enclosed cottage garden overlooking the surrounding woodland.

According to the advert on property website Rightmove.com the cottage is near a 'popular village enjoying convenience store, new medical centre, small shops, hotel, public houses, primary school, church and chapel all of which go to serve the villagers day to day needs'.

The agents for the property said: 'Inside the cottage is just as lovely, with exposed beams, an ingelnook fireplace and a range cooker in the kitchen. The annexe has its own living area, shower and double bedroom'

It continues: 'The Ceiriog Valley is well known for its most attractive countryside and is situated in probably one of the most picturesque areas of North East Wales.'

Hayley Jackson, assistant manager of Halls estate agents, who are marketing the property, described the dream setting as 'magical.'

She said: 'These caverns are a magical and spectacular feature of the property and make this property extremely unique.

'A lovely garden surrounds the entrance to the three arched caverns. Inside there are pools stocked with trout. The property would be ideal for a range of uses, including an outdoor activity centre.

Ms Jackson added: 'A lovely garden surrounds the entrance to the three arched caverns. Inside there are pools stocked with trout. The property would be ideal for a range of uses, including an outdoor activity centre'

'We expect it will be of undoubted appeal to those seeking a unique family home or those with particular outdoor interests.

'We understand from the vendor that the property once benefited from planning consent for an outdoor activity centre to take advantage of the caverns.

'Even without the caverns, the house would be appealing. The gardens are delightful and include cottage-style gardens, a patio, a productive vegetable patch, a paddock garden and a number of fruit trees.

'Inside the cottage is just as lovely, with exposed beams, an ingelnook fireplace and a range cooker in the kitchen. The annexe has its own living area, shower and double bedroom.'
