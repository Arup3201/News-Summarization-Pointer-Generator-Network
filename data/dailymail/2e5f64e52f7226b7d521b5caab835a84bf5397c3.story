The Queen and Prince Philip were greeted by excited workmen today as they arrived at King's Cross station to take a train to Sandringham for their annual Christmas stay.

Their well-wishers - a group of construction workers - snapped away with their camera phones as the couple stepped out of their car.

In keeping with tradition, the Royal couple then boarded a train to King's Lynn station in Norfolk on a 90-minute journey to the private estate where they will enjoy the festivities surrounded by family.

From the station it is a 30-minute journey to Sandringham - just enough time to dip into a novel.

And hence why, perhaps, The Duke of Edinburgh, 91, was carrying a 
copy of the book 'The End Of Empire, Atilla The Hun and The Fall Of 
Rome', by Christopher Kelly.

And the Queen was spotted doing her paperwork as she travelled by the public train.

She surprised other passengers by travelling first class on the 10.45am First Capital Connect service from the station.

They discreetly 
joined more than 50 other unsuspecting people on the train.

The scheduled service, which had no buffet car or refreshments trolley, went via
 Cambridge and arrived six minutes late at 12.26pm in King's Lynn, 
Norfolk.

The Queen was seen getting into the festive spirit as she sat in front of an open briefcase, reading a white card with the word 'Celebrating' on the front - possibly the menu for the Royal family's Christmas Day dinner.

When she arrived at King's Lynn she was then driven to the estate, where she will soon be joined by her close family for Christmas.

The Queen who was wearing a red and 
white patterned coat adjusted her trademark headscarf to protect her 
form the wind and rain as she walked along the platform. She was also holding a bunch of flowers.

The train is a far cry from the luxury the Queen is used to on the royal train.

That comes complete with sleeping car, bathroom and a thickly-carpeted saloon and has as many as nine private carriages.

But due to the huge running costs the train is now only used on very special occasions.

Leaving the train she was followed by four aides carrying bags and the Duke of Edinburgh with his Attila the Hun book in his hand.

The
 couple then went through a side gate into a car park where a Range 
Rover was waiting to drive them seven miles to the 20,000-acre 
Sandringham estate.

Buckingham Palace is thought to have booked all 
dozen seats in the rear first class compartment of the train to ensure 
that the pair could sit undisturbed with their staff.

One way first 
class tickets on the train cost £50 each for the 100 mile 
journey, although it would have been £33 if the Queen had used a
 senior railcard.

Security at the station was stepped up for the Queen's arrival.

One passenger said: 'It is 
amazing to think that we shared a train with the Queen. I had no idea 
that she and Philip were on board until the train stopped.'

A First Capital Connect spokesman said he was unable to comment on the Royal couple being on the train.

In previous years, the train company insisted that it never gave the Queen any special treatment.

The
 Queen and Prince Philip will be joined by other members of the Royal 
family later in the week and will make a public appearance when they 
attend church on Christmas Day.

But Sandringham is expected to be 
quieter this year without the presence of Prince Harry who is on active 
service in Afghanistan.

It was originally thought that Kate 
and William would not be attending Sandringham this Christmas and will 
instead spend it at the Middleton's house but their plans are not yet 
clear.

The Queen and Prince Philip will stay on the estate until the end of January.

Last year Kate spent her first Christmas at the Victorian house, surrounded by another 28 royals.

Every year there is a festive ritual that is always adhered to by family and visitors.

The Queen's Christmas message is to be screened in 3D and HD for the first time, it was announced today.

The traditional broadcast will go hi-tech to allow viewers to scrutinise the Queen as never before in her Diamond Jubilee year.

However, viewers will also be able to see the 86-year-old monarch in normal definition during the speech, which will be broadcast at 3pm on Christmas Day.

The theme of this year's message is not known but it is likely to feature the key highlights from 2012 - the London Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee.

The Queen has watched her 3D Christmas message, produced this year by Sky News, and enjoyed the experience.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said the monarch thought the broadcast was 'absolutely lovely'.

She added: 'We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do.

'The Queen absolutely agreed straight away there was no need for convincing at all, she was absolutely ready to embrace something new in this year.'

First, guests are told what time they should arrive at Sandringham - usually on December 23rd.

It is most junior royals first, most senior last — and are expected to be prompt.

By early afternoon, however, everyone is expected to be in attendance.

They will be ushered to their rooms, furnished in the post-war spartan style the Queen and her consort still fondly cling to — two-bar electric fires and blankets (no duvets).

At 4pm, all having changed into suitable outfits for tea, the family gathers in the White Drawing Room, where the Queen encourages the young royals to help put the finishing touches to the Christmas tree — a Norfolk spruce taken from the 1,000-acre estate.

Over home-baked scones and Earl Grey tea, the Master of the Household usually gives each member a timetable and room-plan so they know where to marshal themselves and when over the weekend.

Trestle tables are laid out in the nearby Red Drawing Room, with sections marked off with tape showing where each family member’s gifts should be placed — and, again, naturally laid out in order of precedence.

Presents exchanged, they will all move through to the hall for drinks — martinis mixed by a servant are popular.

Then it’s back to their rooms, for baths and a second change of clothes.

For dinner, the men are usually dressed in black tie, the women in evening gowns and jewels.

After a gong at 8pm for pre-dinner drinks, the family will sit down to a candlelit, three-course dinner at 8.15pm.

Afterwards, at around 10pm, the women move to another room for coffee, while the men are offered liquers.

The Queen normally doesn’t go to bed until midnight, and no one may leave the party until Her Majesty retires.Christmas Day starts with a full English breakfast, before the annual outing to Sandringham parish church at 11am.

Back at the big house, preparations will be under way for the traditional Christmas lunch — Norfolk turkey, accompanied by a selection of cold meats and an array of side dishes on silver salvers.

The Queen is in charge of the seating plan.

Unseen by guests, however, lunch at Sandringham is a drawn-out affair — with junior staff eating at 11am, senior staff an hour later, the royals at 1.15pm and the junior kitchen staff at 2.15pm.

Then everything comes to a halt so all can watch the Queen’s speech on TV at 3pm.

That afternoon, the royals may go for a walk with the dogs, perhaps play charades or watch TV.

The book by Christopher Kelly that the Duke of Edinburgh was carrying is pictured

Prince Philip kept himself amused on the
 train journey with the Queen today - by reading a book 
about savage barbarian Attila The Hun.

The 91-year-old was seen 
clutching his unusal choice of holiday reading as he and the Queen 
caught a train to start their Christmas and New Year break at 
Sandringham.

The hardback book by Christopher Kelly entitled 'The End
 of Empire, Attila The Hun And The Fall Of Rome' was first published in 
2010 tells how the savage warrior king ravaged Rome in the 5th century.

It
 is described on website Amazon as being 'an original exploration of the
 clash between empire and barbarity in the ancient world, full of 
contemporary resonance.

Its author Mr Kelly, is a professor of ancient history and a Fellow of Corpus Christi College at the University of Cambridge, where he received his PhD in classics.

He lives in Cambridge, England, and also Chicago, Illinois.

The book, The End of Attila the Hun and the Fall of Rome, is about the leader of the Huns, Attila.

The Romans perceived him as a savage barbarian brutally inflicting terror on whoever crossed his path.

Following Attila and the Huns from the steppes of Kazakhstan to the court of Constantinople, Christopher Kelly portrays Attila in a new light.

He uncovers an unlikely marriage proposal, a long-standing relationship with a treacherous Roman general, and a thwarted assassination plot.

Attila is shown as both a master warrior and an astute strategist whose rule was threatening but whose sudden loss of power was even more so.

The End of Empire is an original exploration of the clash between empire and barbarity in the ancient world.
