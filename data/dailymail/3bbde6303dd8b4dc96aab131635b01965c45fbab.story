Demonstrations were held across Britain today in support of five Royal Marines accused of murdering a Taliban prisoner.

The troops were charged a fortnight ago after a video was found on one of the Marines’ computers allegedly showing them discussing what to do with a wounded insurgent in a compound in Afghanistan last year.

Since the arrests, a swell of sympathy for the Marines has been developing on Facebook, with more than 100,000 online supporters joining calls for them to be cleared. This led to a series of demonstrations yesterday in London, Plymouth, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh, Swansea and Norwich.

Protest: Ex-Royal Marines in green berets and members of the public demonstrate outside Downing Street

In support: Hundreds of people walked in the peaceful protest in Plymouth, calling for the five Royal Marines' murder charges to be dropped

Demo: Supporters also gathered in Manchester holding up two giant poppies outside the Town Hall

Details of the incident involving the 
servicemen have not been revealed but the Ministry of Defence described 
it as ‘an engagement with an insurgent’ with no civilians involved.

The groups behind the protests are 
wearing green ribbons behind their poppies, and are calling on the Prime
Minister and MoD to stop military police proceedings, or any court 
martial.

Yesterday – the 348th anniversary of 
the founding of the Royal Marines by King Charles II – hundreds of 
supporters met at 11am in different locations to make their demands 
public.

It is not clear whether any relatives 
of the accused – who have not been named – were taking part. All serving
Marines have been barred from wearing uniforms to any such 
demonstrations.

Organiser of the Leeds protest, former
Army private Stef Proietti, 36, said tens of thousands of people 
believed troops in Afghanistan were doing a dangerous job and needed to 
be free of prosecution.

He added that the mother and sister of
one of the men accused had spoken to him privately – but said warnings 
from the MoD meant they were unable to formally campaign.

Mr Proietti 
said: ‘We had about 120 people in a show of support next to the war 
memorial in Leeds city centre. The American soldiers who shot dead 
unarmed Osama Bin Laden haven’t been arrested for murder – so why are we
arresting Royal Marines who were being attacked and shot at?’

Mr Proietti added that the mother of 
the accused Marine he had met had told him £1,000 a month was being 
taken out of his wages to pay his legal fees.

He went on: ‘Military 
welfare officers aren’t even letting the families of the five men talk 
to each other. The families are scared of speaking out.’

He said his Facebook page – titled 
‘Support the 7 Royal Marines’ because two more men were originally under
suspicion – now had 64,000 supporters.

In London, almost 100 former Marines 
and family members attended an informal ‘gathering of support’ opposite 
Downing Street.

A larger London event had been planned, but was 
cancelled over fears it would be hijacked by groups such as the British 
National Party and the English Defence League. The Daily Mail found a 
number of EDL supporters among those linked to the Marines Facebook 
groups.

Merry march: The crowd was greeted with cheers and beeping car horns when they reached the city centre

Former Marine James Grant, 34 – a 
veteran of two tours in Afghanistan – said the charges against the five 
were unjust. He said: ‘They were doing their job in incredibly difficult
circumstances. Most of our politicians have not been out to Afghanistan
and can never imagine what it is like to be at war.’

As well as wearing their regimental 
ties, a number of the supporters were also wearing green lapel ribbons 
being sold by the campaign – some bearing the words ‘Free the 5’.

Another former Marine, Bob Tucker, 57,
said: ‘These lads were carrying out Government orders and now it feels 
like they have been hung out to dry.’

In Plymouth, up to 300 people gathered
to march close to the barracks of the the Royal Marines’ 3 Commando 
Brigade, waving ‘Justice for the five’, and ‘British military betrayed’ 
placards.

In Manchester, pub manager Mark Anderson, 42, led dozens of protesters as they gathered outside the Town Hall.

The MoD is refusing to comment on the ongoing case. The five Marines are due to offer pleas at a hearing in December.

This is the first time UK troops have 
been charged with murder during the conflict in Afghanistan. Strict 
rules of engagement, largely derived from the Geneva Convention, dictate
how troops treat the enemy.

Backing our boys: People of all ages, many wearing poppies and green ribbons, came out in support for the five Royal Marines in Plymouth today

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
