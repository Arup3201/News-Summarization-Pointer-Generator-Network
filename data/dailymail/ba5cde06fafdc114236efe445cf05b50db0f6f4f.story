A 75-year-old woman was found dead and hogtied in her Georgia apartment, police have revealed.

Florene Duke's grandchildren went in search of her on Monday after being unable to reach her for hours.

Horrified, they found her lifeless body at the property in Douglas County at 6pm, and saw her TV had vanished.

Killed: Florene Duke, 75, (pictured in her apartment earlier this year) was found dead and tied like a hog in her apartment by her granddaughter who couldn't get hold of her by phone. Two televisions were also missing

Police are now working to determine how she was killed and what the killer's motive was.

Duke's grandson, Chris Duke, told WSBTV: 'I didn't believe it because my grandma wouldn't hurt a fly.

'She got a little dog and she just walked her dog every day; about twice a day and just sat on the couch and watched TV.

'They need to be off the street, whoever did this.'

His grandmother had lived alone in the apartment for five years, Chris Duke explained.

She was last seen alive at 9am on Monday.

Shocked: Relatives say she looked after everybody in the neighborhood and police cannot find a motive

Douglasville police Chief Chris Womack told The AJC: 'The family member went through there and said they saw a couple of TVs missing,' gesturing to a window.

'From everyone we've talked to, from neighbors and family, [she] was like everybody's granny, that always took care of everybody, that would let people come in and stay with her if they didn't have a place to stay, so it's just senseless,' he said. 

'We want to jump on this fast and hard, and bring somebody to justice for this.

'This is pitiful, terrible.'
