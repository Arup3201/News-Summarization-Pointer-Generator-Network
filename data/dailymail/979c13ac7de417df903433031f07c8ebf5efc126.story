In the last moments that Chad Wolfe was seen alive, new airport surveillance footage shows several episodes of bizarre behavior.

Investigators have been struggling to solve the mystery of how the 31-year-old arrived at a Florida airport with his girlfriend only to be found dead the following morning at the bottom of an elevator shaft.

According to airline records, Wolfe 
arrived with girlfriend Jessica Price into Tampa Bay at 12.15am on March 15 on Delta Flight 2233 from Atlanta, Georgia.

Footage revealed on Thursday shows Wolfe drinking from what appears to be a mini bottle of liquor as he trails behind Price while walking through the terminal.

Bizarre: Chad Wolfe is seen on surveillance footage drinking from a small bottle as he follows his girlfriend through Tampa Airport

Strange antics: Wolfe was later seen climbing a small tree in the airport in the time and date-stamped footage

As Miss Price walks purposefully ahead, Mr Wolfe at one point tries to climb a small tree in the terminal.

The couple are then spotted by the elevators. Miss Price dashes ahead to get into one while Mr Wolfe looks around before boarding another, according to the clip obtained by 10 News.

It is the last time that the young man was seen alive.

Investigators believe that Wolfe entered an elevator on the third floor of the main terminal that went to the seventh floor of the Short Term Parking Garage. 

Miss Price later told Mr Wolfe's father, Garland Wolfe, that Chad had one drink on the plane and a Xanax to help him fly.

She was waiting for him on the main 
concourse while she got her luggage from baggage claim. When she came 
back, he had vanished.

Disappeared: Mr Wolfe looks over at the elevator his girlfriend just entered before heading to the one in front of him. He was found dead in a shaft at the airport the next morning

She then notified airport security of the disappearance.

Mr Garland told reporters that airport police told him they think Chad forced the elevator doors open and then fell to his death.

He's skeptical of that claim, noting that his son was only 150 pounds and not strong enough to pry the doors open.

His uncle Bob Young told WPTV the family believes Miss Price had nothing to do with Wolfe's death.

Although no foul play is suspected, officials continue to investigate the mysterious death of the Pennsylvania man.

Maintenance workers at Tampa Bay International Airport discovered the body in the elevator shaft of a parking garage on March 15.  Wolfe's luggage and cell phone were discovered on the seventh floor.

Several workers from the airport believe it's possible Wolfe mistakenly entered into an empty elevator bank. 

TIA released a statement: 'Investigators have determined that shortly after midnight on Friday,
Wolfe entered an elevator on the third floor of the main terminal that 
stopped on the seventh floor of the Short Term Parking Garage.'
