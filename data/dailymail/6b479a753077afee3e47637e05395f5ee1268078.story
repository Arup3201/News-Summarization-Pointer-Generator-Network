A Texas dog-lover had her legs and fingers amputated on Tuesday after a family dog bit her on Christmas Day and infected her with a rare blood infection.

Mother-of-four Robin Sullins, 48, of Austin, who owns a chihuahua, a terrier and a boxer lab, was breaking up a fight between one of her dogs and her daughter Hannah's pet on Christmas Day.

She was bitten by her daughter's dog on the arm but only suffered a minor cut.

Dog attack: Robin Sullins has had both legs and all her fingers amputated after suffering a minor dog bite

However, within two days she became violently ill, according to ABCNews.

Doctors say she was infected with Capnocytophaga Canimorsus, a bacteria commonly found in the mouths of healthy cats and dogs and not normally dangerous. 

However, an unusual reaction in Sullins' has left her having to have both her legs amputated below the knees and all her fingers removed apart from her thumb.

'What's clearly happened here is that the bacteria has gotten into the bloodstream,' Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center told ABC News.

'Once into the blood stream it has created sepsis, a serious infection which has an effect on all the bodies regulatory and inflammatory mechanisms.'

Rescuer: Robin Sullins is well-known for her love of dogs and has saved many over the years. She was breaking up a fight between two dogs when she was bitten

In Sullins case it caused blood vessels in her hands and legs to clot.

'Both of her legs had turned black below the knees," her mother Carol Wilson told the broadcaster.

'Her body was literally dying, her extremities were dying, it's like a horror movie, I can't put it into words.'

'Everybody is devastated, we are probably more devastated than she even is because she's got the spirit,' Wilson added. 'Everybody is standing by her, she has not been by herself for one minute.

'We feel very confident that not only will she walk again with prosthesis, but she is going to make the most of what she has.'

Mother-of-four: Robin Sullins, of Austin, Texas, children are at her hospital bedside. She was bitten by her daughter's dog on Christmas Day

Hannah, who is eight months pregnant, has been by her mother's bedside alongside her siblings,

A doctor treating Sullins said they are hopeful she will recover despite the horrific impact of her injuries

'She is still in a tremendous amount of pain, she is still on dialysis, I think she is potentially facing some more surgeries on her extremities, the prognosis is still favorable for her kidney function to recover,' Dr. Kristen Mondy told ABC.  

The family has started a website, www.robinsullins.com, to raise awareness for bite treatments and to raise money for Sullins health cover.

It describes how her pet dogs 'are her best friends' and says she's rescued more 'four-footers than we can count'.

'She says, 'I don't want it to happen to anybody else,' her mother added.
