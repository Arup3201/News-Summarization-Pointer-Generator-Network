Mid air drama: Stephen Fry was forced to make an emergency stop in Dubai when the Qantas plane suffered engine difficulties

Stephen Fry was on board a Qantas plane which was forced to make an emergency landing after one of its engines failed.

The London-bound A380 was four hours into a flight from Singapore when it suffered oil problems today.

The star Tweeted: 'B****r. Forced to land in Dubai. An engine has decided not to play.'

He was flying back to London tonight after being allocated a seat on an Emirates flight following a 16-hour delay.

There were 258 passengers on board the Qantas flight when the pilot was forced to shut down one of the four engines and make the unscheduled stop.

Fry complained that he had been left waiting on the plane before he was allowed to go into the building. His misery was then compounded when he left his wallet on the plane.

The author and comedian wrote: 'I've left my wallet on the sodding plane. Hell's teeth this really isn't my day. Will not leave without it.'

The incident comes a year to the day after the engine of another Qantas A380 blew up over Singapore.

A spokesman for Qantas said the superjumbo had suffered a problem with oil pressure in its number four engine, describing the incident as a 'one off'.

He confirmed it was not the same A380 that was involved in last year's incident, adding that the timing of the problem was a 'coincidence'.

The airline said it is working to arrange alternative flights to take the passengers on to London.

Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight last year after the midair explosion over Singapore, caused by a faulty pipe in the Rolls Royce engines.

Last weekend the airline grounded its entire fleet as a result of an ongoing battle with the unions, affecting thousands of passengers.

Fry later wrote: 'I think plan is to bus us to the transit lounge and await International Rescue. This plane, the crew tell me, is going nowhere.'

He added: 'So either Sydney send another one out or they come to an accommodation with Emirates. Either way not a great week for #qantas!'

The 54-year-old also posted a picture of an apology letter given by the airline to the stricken passengers, which warned passengers they faced 'an extended delay'.

Fry was flying back to the UK after touring Australia with the television show QI.
