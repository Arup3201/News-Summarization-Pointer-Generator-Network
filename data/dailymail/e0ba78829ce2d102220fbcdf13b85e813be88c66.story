Paula Orbea has launched a petition to rid of offensive and sexist slogans by Wicked Campervans

An Australian woman has claimed a company which operates a fleet of hire vans for tourists is fueling a 'rape culture' after her 11-year-old daughter complained to her about a sexist remark plastered on the rear of one its vehicles.

High school teacher and Sydney mum Paula Orbea, 44, has launched an online petition with change.org addressed to the founder of Wicked Campervans, John Webb, which asks him to  'Eliminate misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery,' advertised on the side and rear of vehicles.

She is lobbying Mr Webb to remove the slogans after her daughter sighted a Wicked Campervan with the phrase 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once' while out with her grandmother.

She said it was the first thing her daughter told her after the outing, and couldn't believe the words that came out of her mouth.

'She came up to me and said 'mummy I just saw the most horrible thing' alluding to the 'princess' slogan.

She said the company was 'perpetuating' a culture of rape and wanted to highlight her disapproval of slogans, she alleges, are indirectly playing a role in the sexual assault of women.

'I can't prove that these slogans will cause a male to do that, but it's immoral and its hurting people.'

'These perspectives are dangerous and now it's hit my family.'

Promoted as 'budget' travel for tourists looking to road trip through parts of Australia, the hire vans offer travellers fully-functional eat, sleep and drive capabilities.

A litany of complaints have been leveled with the Advertising Standards Bureau against Wicked Campervans for its use of advertising slogans

This is perhaps one of the less controversial slogans posted on the rear of a the Wicked Campervan

There are packages, specials and different sizes and varieties of vans available. Some have slogans while some come without.

The company was approached for comment about a litany of complaints leveled against it via the Advertising Standards Bureau, but so far has not returned calls. A foreigner working for the company said Mr Webb was not available on Sunday.

Daily Mail Australia counted some 60 complaints - either dismissed or upheld - against the company's use of slogans - including one which was dismissed that read: 'To all virgins: Thanks for nothing.'

Mrs Orbea said her daughter made a complaint to the same advertising watchdog, which handles consumer complaints about advertising in Australia, but has only heard back about the fact the inquiry has been lodged.

The company offers budget campervan rentals popular with tourists opting to take road trips along Australia's east coast

Mrs Orbea's petition references Rolf Harris and links his recent guilty verdict for sexual misconduct with the slogans, is now at 11,300 signatures.

And while Mrs Orbea didn't see the van, she had seen a photo of that exact phrase posted by Australian author and outspoken public speaker Clementine Ford on her Facebook.

Mrs Orbea's petition, which references Rolf Harris and links his recent guilty verdict for sexual misconduct with the slogans, is now at 11,300 signatures.

She said she has emailed the terms of the petition to Mr Webb for his comment.

The petition reads: 'This particular phrase promotes paedophilia and resonates very badly with everyone who thinks it's abhorrent to sexually assault a girl, especially by groomed males who think 'she wants it'.

'Slogans such as this ring too familiar to real life atrocities, such as the recent discovery of Rolf Harris's sexual assaults; enacting on a girl as young as eight.'

She wrote that it was 'inconceivable' that Wicked Campers choose to not only write the misogynistic 'joke' but also publicise it through their moving, billboard vans.

She ends the petition, which she said hopes brings the company to shame, by saying: 'This is not good. I'm calling it out.  Join me. Paula'
