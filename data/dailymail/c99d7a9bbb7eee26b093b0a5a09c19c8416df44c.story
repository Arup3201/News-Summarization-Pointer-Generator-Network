Surrounded by severed heads, limbless bodies and with empty eye-sockets staring back at visitors from all directions, the Isla de las Munecas – The Island of Dolls – is one morbid place for a day out.

Dedicated to the memory of a little girl who drowned in the canal many years ago, the island is covered in hundreds of dolls.

The creepiest tourist attraction on the map is located in the Xochimilco canals, about 17 miles south of Mexico City, Mexico.

Hermit's secret: The island was not discovered until the 1990s and has now become a tourist attraction

The island is in fact a floating garden, known as a chinampa, which belonged to a man named Julian Santana Barrera, a hermit who lived isolated on the canal.

His bizarre creation was discovered in the 1990s when the local council came to clean up the canal and since then the Island of Dolls has become a tourist attraction.

Mr Santana Barrera created the terrifying island in dedication of a little girl whose dead body he found floating in the canal near his home.

Tragic end: Don Julian died in 2001 and was allegedly found dead int he same spot he had found the little girl all those years before

A few days later he found a doll in the same spot and, believing that the girl’s spirit lived on inside it, he hung it up.

Over the years he collected old and broken dolls from rubbish tips and around the canals and nailed them to walls of his home and hung them from trees as a memorial to the girl.

After the discovery of the Island of Dolls, Mr Santana Barrera became a local celebrity and visitors would bring him dolls until the island was covered in hundreds of severed limbs and blank-eyed toys.

Mr Santana Barrera died in 2001. He drowned in the canal, allegedly on the very same spot he had found the little girl.

New additions: Tourist frequently bring their own dolls, which are hung up next to Don Julian's collection

For the brave: The dolls look terrifying in the sunlight, and a visit after dark is not recommended
