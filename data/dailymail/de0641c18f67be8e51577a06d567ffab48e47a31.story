John Prescott's granddaughter has revealed that he eats chips for breakfast as well as dinner.

The portly Labour stalwart eats so many chips, according to five-year-old Ava Grace, that she thought he worked in a chip shop.

Appearing on ITV's Big Star's Little Star, Ava tells host Stephen Mulhern, when asked what her grandfather 'wasn't very good at', that he 'isn't very good at keeping fit'.

She adds: 'Because he eats too many chips in the morning and the evening.' 

She added that he liked them because they were cheap'.

She also correctly guessed that her 'Papa's' favourite thing was his beloved Jaguar car, and that he would least like to be stuck in a lift with David Cameron.  

Joining him on the programme - which will be aired tomorrow at 8pm - are athlete Mo Farah and daughter Rhianna, aged nine, and EastEnders star Rita Simons and twins Maiya and Jaimee, aged nine.

The 76-year-old former MP, now Baron Prescott of Kingston upon Hull, has in the past spoken of his love of food, and his battle with bulimia.

He used to make himself sick up to four times a day after bingeing on trifles, Chinese food, burgers and fish and chips.

He says the eating disorder is not something that ‘just goes away’ but he has learned to ‘discipline’ himself.

In Prezza: My Story: Pulling No Punches, he wrote: 'I'd just turn to some digestive biscuits, which meant a packet of them, scoffing the lot, then perhaps another packet.

'I could sup a whole tin of Carnation milk, just for the taste, stupid things like that. Marks & Spencer trifles, I still love them, one of my favourites.

'I can eat them for ever.

'Whenever I go to Mr Chu's in Hull, my favourite Chinese restaurant in the whole world, great atmosphere, great people, I could eat my way through the entire menu.'
