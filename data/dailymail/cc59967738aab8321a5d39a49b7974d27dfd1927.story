The massive security operation for the Brisbane G20 has set a new benchmark for future international events, police say.

There was no hint of the kind of violent protests that marred previous G20 summits in Toronto and London when world leaders gathered this weekend.

And concerns about potential terrorist attacks or large scale cyber attacks proved unfounded.

Queensland police, who were ready for any potential terror attacks, hope their security measures will set a new worldwide 'benchmark'

There were few arrests, despite dozens of protests playing out on the sidelines of the event.

About 6,000 police patrolled the city, with authorities denying it was a case of overkill with so many internationally protected leaders present at once.

But they have also credited the tolerant approach officers took with keeping any heat out of the protests, despite the weekend's baking temperatures.

Just 27 people were excluded from G20 security zones and 14 were arrested in the lead up to and during the summit. Most face minor charges such as failing to state their name and address.

A man was detained at 8.30am on Sunday outside the hotel was where U.S. President Barack Obama was staying during the G20 Summit

Queensland police deputy commissioner Ross Barnett said the potential for serious incidents justified the scale of the police presence.

'An event like this is obviously a high-value terrorist threat,' he told reporters as the summit wrapped up on Sunday.

'There was no overkill in terms of the security planning and preparation.'

Mr Barnett said the operation's success meant the Brisbane G20 would be remembered for all the right reasons.

'The enduring legacy about Brisbane will not be anything about the security operation. It won't be burning police cars and damage,' he said.

Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he hoped the operation would become a benchmark for international events, including the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.

He said he expected Turkish security teams would contact him to discuss the 2015 G20 summit there.

'It's worked so well I hope others will look at it, just like we looked at what went wrong in other places around the world,' Mr Stewart said, referring to violent protests in 2010 in Toronto.

There were fewer protests on the last day of the summit than on Saturday, but they still had the potential to flare up given that they took place in temperatures nearing 40 degrees Celsius.

It was a struggle for police as well, with Mr Barnett saying snipers atop city rooftops endured 'brutal' temperatures as high as 63 degrees Celsius.

The most recent security incident during the G20 involved a man who was detained at the back of a Brisbane hotel by police, mere moments after U.S. President Barack Obama left the building on Sunday.

It is understood the  man was detained from 8.30am until 11am on Sunday morning

The man was forced to remain at scene after being stopped at the rear of the Marriott Hotel.

He was questioned by an officer and forced to remove his shoes while a swarm of police searched through his belongings.

The man, who appears to be in his twenties, was stopped at 8.30am with two suitcases. 

Various items were photographed, which appeared to include paper and cardboard. 

Police were also seen holding up a plastic bag which contained foreign currency. 

There are reports that a second man was also reportedly detained at the scene and his belongings were searched. 

It's claimed they were both allowed to leave at around 11am.

Mr Obama is staying at the hotel during the G20 Summit and had left on Sunday morning for a trilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The US President has been basing himself in the $2,500 a night Presidential Suite at the Marriott Hotel on Queen Street.

Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon.

Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls. 

His room is on the top floor, with a king size bed and 131 square metres of room to play with, as well as panoramic views of Brisbane River. 

The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms, 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space.
