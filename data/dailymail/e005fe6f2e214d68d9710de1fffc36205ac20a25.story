Two former winners are on a four-man short-list for the Steve Prescott Man of Steel award.

Leeds prop Jamie Peacock and St Helens hooker James Roby, who lifted the Man of Steel title in 2003 and 2007 respectively, are competing for the highly-prestigious award with Castleford hooker Daryl Clark and Warrington prop Chris Hill.

The award, which was first made in 1977, goes to the player who has had the biggest impact on the season and has been re-named in honour of former Hull and St Helens full-back Steve Prescott, who lost his battle with stomach cancer last November.

The short-list was drawn up following a poll of every Super League player, with the results going in front of a specially-convened panel featuring a former Man of Steel, representatives from the players' union and one representative each from the written and broadcast media.

Clark has also been nominated as the 2014 Super League Young Player of the Year, along with Wigan centre Dan Sarginson and Leeds stand-off Liam Sutcliffe.

The 2014 Steve Prescott Man of Steel will be named at a gala dinner hosted at The Point, Old Trafford, on Wednesday October 8, three days before the First Utility Super League Grand Final.

Scotland and Huddersfield scrum half Danny Brough is the current holder of the award
