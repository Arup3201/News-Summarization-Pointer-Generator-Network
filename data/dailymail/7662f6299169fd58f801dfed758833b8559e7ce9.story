Luis Montes' World Cup dream is dead and buried after the Mexico midfielder suffered a suspected leg fracture against Ecuador on Saturday night.

The 28-year-old got his side going in the 3-1 win with a stunning strike on 33 minutes, only for his fortunes to change horrifically two minutes later.

Montes was stretchered off after a coming together with Ecuador's Segundo Castillo, leaving coach Miguel Herrera to admit the team 'prayed for him'.

'We prayed
 for him and now we're going to hope that he recuperates as soon as 
possible,' said Mexico coach Miguel Herrera, speaking through a 
translator.

'We're going to have a long talk tomorrow to keep the players focused.'

The clash left Montes, who plays his football for Leon, unable to stand as the Mexican covered his face while carried off the field to the applause of 84,876 fans.

Castillo, too, limped off after the entanglement and did not return.

Montes was
 sent to the hospital for an evaluation of the apparent fracture to his 
lower right leg, and looks certain to be absent for Mexico's World Cup 
campaign in Group A against Brazil, Croatia and Cameroon.

Mexican captain Rafael Marquez also went
 to the hospital for an injury to his right foot, but Herrera said the 
move was precautionary after Montes' injury.

Ecuador, on the other hand, have one final friendly before the World Cup starts and take on Roy Hodgson's England in Miami on Wednesday.
