Its absence had left fans feeling a little deflated but after being given a spring clean, the giant duck is back.

The 50ft high yellow inflatable was seen floating in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour after more than a week away.

It has now been reinstalled after being cleaned and checked.

Pictures of the enormous duck lying 
deflated on the surface of the water led to predictions of the duck's 
demise but exhibition organisers confirmed it was simply enjoying 
'sleepy time'.

The duck - named Spreading Joy Around The World - was created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman.

Hong Kong's biggest shopping mall Harbour City, which organised the exhibition, heralded the duck's return on Twitter.

A spokesman tweeted: 'Thanks for all the support everyone! I am all freshen up! (sic)'

It has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since it first bobbed into the harbour this month.

The floating sculpture was due to remain at the Ocean Terminal for a month.

Since 2007, it has travelled to ten countries and 12 cities, including Osaka, Sydney, Sao Paulo and Amsterdam.

It is always deflated for transportation and then re-inflated in its new home using a generator.

It's next scheduled stop after Hong Kong is a closely guarded secret.
