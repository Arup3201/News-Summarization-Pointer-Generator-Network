A Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because of religious beliefs has been told by the Civil Rights Commission that he can't discriminate against customers.

The state's commission has told Jack Phillips that his religious objections to same-sex weddings did not trump Colorado's anti-discrimination statues.

The unanimous ruling upheld an administrative law judge's finding in December that Phillips violated civil rights law when he refused an order from a gay couple in 2012, who later sued.

Overruled: Baker Jack Phillips has been told he can't discriminate against same-sex customers because of his Christian beliefs

'I can believe anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not discriminate against people,' Commissioner Raju Jaram said.

Phillips, a Christian who owns the Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said the decision violates his First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of his religion.

'I will stand by my convictions until somebody shuts me down,' he told reporters after the ruling.

He added that his bakery had been so overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy cookies and brownies that he does not currently make wedding cakes.

Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig, who sued Phillips, were pleased that the commission roundly rejected Phillips' arguments. 'We're just thrilled by that,' Mullins said.

Gay marriage remains illegal in Colorado. Mullins and Craig were married in Massachusetts and wanted a wedding cake for a reception to celebrate their union at their home in Westminster, another Denver suburb.

An attorney for Denver baker Phillips says they are considering appealing the ruling

State law prohibits businesses from refusing to serve customers based on their sexual orientation.

The panel issued its ruling verbally. It ordered Phillips to stop discriminating against gay people and to report quarterly for two years on staff anti-discrimination training and any customers he refuses to serve.

Phillips' attorney said she was considering appealing the ruling to the Colorado Court of Appeals.
