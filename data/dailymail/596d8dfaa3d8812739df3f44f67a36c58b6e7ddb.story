After more than a year during which he claimed to be shut out by the military bureaucracy, Army Specialist Brent Grommet was reunited with the bomb-sniffing dog injured with him in Afghanistan.

Thanks to a Clinton-era law, Grommet, 23, was supposed to be the first in line to adopt Matty, his bomb-sniffing German shepherd K9 unit, when they both returned from Afghanistan in 2013.

Instead he spent 16 months fighting cold shoulders from the military and its contractors and searching for a dog that had all but disappeared.

Long-lost: Specialist Brent Grommet was reunited Friday with Matty, the German shepherd he served with as a bomb-detecting technician in Afghanistan

The New York Post reports that the soldier and his parents drove  from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where Grommet is stationed, to South Carolina, after he was told he could take custody of Matty.

Grommet stopped 25 feet from the cage where Matty was and hesitated. 'I was a little worried he forgot me,' he later said.

But when he called the dog's name and the kennel door was opened, there was no mistaking that Matty remembered his war buddy.

'He jumped all over me,' said Grommet. 'I couldn’t have asked for a better response. I knew then that he remembered me, and truly wanted to be with me.'

Grommet had to sign a non-disclosure agreement not to reveal the names of those who were taking care of Matty in South Carolina in order to get him back, the final twist in their strange separation.

The two had been together since basic training, and during their deployment to Afghanistan, where they worked to detect explosives, were caught by a roadside bomb blast.

Grommet suffered traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and spinal-cord injury, resulting in surgery that has not quite alleviated the chronic pain and PTSD.

Still, Grommet had Matty by his side to rely on during the remainder of his tour. When he flew back to the United States, he slept on top of Matty's crate.

Long-lost: Grommet says that he and Matty had been separated for 16 months with no word from the Army, leading him to worry someone else had adopted him

When they arrived back in the US, they were separated in accordance with standard Army procedures. 

Thanks to a law from 2000 known as Robby's Law, which allows a returning handler to adopt his animal if they were injured together during service, Grommet knew he only had to wait to adopt Matty.

But after filling out paperwork with K2 Solution, a contractor charged with setting the Army up with service dogs, Grommet kept waiting while worrying someone else had adopted Matty.

'It’s like someone stole your kid in front of you,' Grommet said before Matty's return, 'and there’s nothing you can do about it.'

The family began calling around military bases handling K9 units, but found no response to where Grommet's partner had been taken.

After a call to Fort Bragg in North Carolina, a civilian tipped the family off to the person they needed to contact: Richard Vargas, then a lieutenant colonel in charge of dog adoptions.

'I adopted the dog out legally, so there’s nothing you can do about it,' Vargas reportedly told Grommet's father Don when he phoned.

Brent says that when he himself tried to contact Vargas, they had a 30-second conversation during which Vargas said there was nothing he could do and told him not to call again.

It's not clear what finally allowed Grommet and Matty to be reunited, but the dog's return to his former handler has allowed the soldier to try and heal from his mental and physical wounds.

'It’s very hard to be upset around him,' Grommet said. 'He brings a lot of light into everything.'
