Business minister Nick Boles said Britain would noy be able to 'entirely' control European migration as long as it stayed in the EU

We will never be able to control our borders so long as Britain remains in the EU, a Tory minister warned last night.

In an explosive interview, skills minister Nick Boles said the free movement of people is a fundamental principle of the EU that Britain has to accept.

As long as the UK remains a successful economy, Britons need to get used to a ‘very large amount of immigration every year’.

Mr Boles’s words blow a hole in David Cameron’s argument that he can claw back any meaningful powers from Brussels over UK borders. They will also be seized on by Ukip and Eurosceptic Tories as proof that his talks with Brussels will achieve little.

German chancellor Angela Merkel has already said she would not agree to any ‘tampering’ with EU migration rules. In an interview with Total Politics magazine, Mr Boles insisted the British people would favour a reasonable level of immigration if they thought Parliament had control. But he admitted that those who believed MPs did not have such control were ‘right’.

‘I will always make the argument that we should, for cultural, economic, justice and equality reasons, always have a reasonable level of immigration,’ he said.

‘It will always be the position the British people would arrive at if they feel they have control over immigration. You can win that argument but only if people know that they, through their Parliament, are in control.

‘The difficulty that has arisen is this sense that we don’t have that control – and, bluntly, they’re right. It’s true.’

He added: ‘We may never be able to control it entirely, because it’s a fundamental principle of the EU, but it will be very hard for the British people to accept that.’ Last night Mr Boles clarified his statements, saying: ‘I do not believe and did not say that we cannot seek changes to the way immigration works within the EU. Quite the contrary, I think it is essential that we do so.’

Meanwhile, it emerged the Tory bill to enshrine in law Mr Cameron’s promised referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should stay in the EU will not be voted on in the Commons – due to a row with his Lib Dem partners. Tory MP Bob Neill, who was taking the bill through Parliament, accused Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg of ‘killing off our chances’ of putting it into law. 

David Cameron gave a statement to the Commons yesterday on the latest EU fallout over its demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain

National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed

Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures
