Guilty: Former builder Raymond Knight, 72, broke two restraining orders in pursuit of a married doctor

A stalker who made a married doctor's life a 'living hell' has been jailed for nearly four years.

Raymond Knight, 72, harassed Dr Eleanor Aston for five years, forcing her to quit her job because she was so traumatised.

He regularly photographed her when she left work and at 
her home, and even followed her husband to a children’s birthday party, 
where he stabbed his car tyre with a knife.

Mr Knight, who has a delusional disorder, told people that he was having an affair with the married doctor and that he was the father of one of her children.

Mr Knight, a former builder, and Dr Aston met in 2006, and 
had a normal patient doctor relationship at the Hadwen Medical Centre in
Abbeymead, Gloucester, but a year later Knight began to make 
'inappropriate contact'.

He visited more than 1,000 websites in an attempt to find out information about her and started turning up her house unannounced. 

In June 2009 he was convicted of 
harassing Dr Aston by sending her unsolicited cards and flowers and 
repeatedly driving to her home.

He was given a retraining order in June 2009 - and again in July 2010 and today he pleaded guilty to six counts of breaching the order between June and August 2012.

In July 2012 police searched Knight’s
car and found details of Dr Aston’s accountant, a 
close friend and a party which her daughter was due to attend.

Mr Knight called the friend pretending to be her accountant in his pursuit of the doctor.

Dr Aston of Benhall, Gloucestershire, 
has since been forced to give up work due to the 'severe psychological trauma'
caused by Mr Knight's harassment.

Deluded: Raymond Knight believed that his GP was in love with him and had fathered one of his children

Once confident and outgoing doctor, the court heard that she now  'hides behind the sofa' at home because she is scared he is outside.

Judge Tabor QC told Mr Knight: 'Your actions have made her life and that of her family a living hell.

'She suffers now of deepest paranoia. You appear to be completely oblivious to the consequences of your actions.'

Prosecuting, Kannan Siva said: 'She has become paranoid and jumpy and suffering from insomnia.

'She can’t turn into her own driveway without checking up and down her road.'

Scared: Mr Knight used to drive to Dr Aston's surgery in Gloucester to photograph her as she left work

Defending Mr Knight, his lawyer Giles Nelson said he was a 'sick man'. Mr Knight denied another two counts of breaching the order which will lay on file.

Giving evidence at the sentencing, Dr James Laidlaw said: 'His delusion is that he is in love with Dr Aston. He sees other evidence that we do not see.'

Mr Knight will stay in hospital and undergo psychological treatment then he will be sent to prison to
serve the rest of his sentence.
