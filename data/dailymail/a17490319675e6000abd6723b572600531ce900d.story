A Brazilian Serie A match between Figueirense and Internacional descended into chaos on Saturday as Figueirense players chased the referee after the final whistle.

Internacional had just secured a 2-1 victory to earn a third place finish as the Brazilian season draws to a close, but Figueirense were incensed after having two players sent off before conceding goals in the 87th and 95th minute.

The home players and fans decided to vent their fury towards match official Marielson Alves Silva, who was forced to sprint away from a crowd off angry players.

Silva looked to find safety behind several riot police on the pitch as the Internacional team helped the terrified referee away from the trouble.

Despite suffering from some shoving and pushing from the distraught Figueirense players, Silva managed to get away unharmed.

Former Portsmouth midfielder Andres D'Alessandro also made his way onto the pitch, despite missing the game, to celebrate with his team-mates, who by finishing third, had also secured a place in next season's Copa Libertadores.

Figueirense had taken the lead in the 50th minute following a strike from Pablo, before last-gasp goals from Rafael Moura and Wellington Silva condemned the home side to a 12th placed finish.
