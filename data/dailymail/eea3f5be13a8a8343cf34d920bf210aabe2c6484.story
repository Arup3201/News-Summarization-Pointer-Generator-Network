Diet fads come and go, from Atkins to the Dukan diet, there is always a new means to a thinner end.

And with 90 per cent of British women having been on some form of diet in their lifetime, it has now been revealed that women spend a staggering 17 years of their life dieting.

Of these loyal dieters, the average woman loses her body weight over nine times during her life time.

Women spend a staggering seventeen years of their lives dieting and the average will lose their body weight over nine times

The study also found that the average woman diets twice a year, losing 11lbs each time.

Life expectancy data reveals that the average woman lives until 82 and weighs on average 11 stone, so if she begins dieting at the age of 18, she will lose her body weight 9.1 times and if she spends seven weeks on a diet twice a year she will spend 17.2 years dieting.

Kevin Dorren, Founder & Head Chef of Diet Chef, who carried out the research, said: ‘Deciding to lose weight can be an easy one to make when we know we have a special occasion coming up or aren’t feeling confident in our appearance, however as we can see actually embarking on a diet and losing the extra pounds is more difficult and takes real commitment.'

Health reasons, having a muffin top and wanting to look good in a bikini are top incentives for dieting

Those in the North West find it hardest to stick to a diet, only able to sum up the stamina for four days on average – the shortest amount of time in the UK.

Whereas those in the North East (11 per cent) and East Anglia (17 per cent) have the most willpower with their last diet lasting one month.

Less than one per cent of women managed to stick to a diet for a 12 month period and a third of all women diet for at least six months per year.

Summer holidays (33 per cent)

Health reasons 
(22 per cent)

Weddings (18 per cent)

Not fitting into any of their clothes was the top prompt (52 per cent) to lose weight with the same number of people saying that developing a muffin top was the first sign that they had piled on the pounds.

Ultimately it is a general love of food (35 per cent) and lack of willpower (33 per cent) that keeps would-be dieters from achieving their dream body with over a third saying they were their main reasons for struggling with managing their weight loss. Although a fifth of women say that they find it too expensive to buy healthy food.

One in three women will splurge on comfort purchases when feeling down about their diet, with shoes being the top thing to buy (37 per cent).
