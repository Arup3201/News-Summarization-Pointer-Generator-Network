An employee for the Federal Aviation Administration was arrested Tuesday after flying from Atlanta to New York with a gun concealed in his carry on, officials announced Friday.

The Transportation Security Administration said in a statement that an FAA safety inspector used his badge to move through security screening.

The inspector then gained access to a secure area of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport with the weapon in his bag, but was arrested after arrival in New York's LaGuardia Airport.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta suspended a program that allows agency inspectors to bypass the security screening process, the statement added. 

The agency said it will require inspectors to sign an agreement 'that any infraction related to a weapon will result in an immediate and permanent suspension of privileges and possible further disciplinary action.'

The employee is still with the FAA, performing 'non-safety-related duties,' while an investigation is conducted by the TSA and police for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, CBS reports. 

Concerns over porous security at airports were raised after authorities broke up a gun-smuggling ring composed of current and former airline employees last month

The five men allegedly involved in the scheme tried to smuggle 153 firearms, including AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles, most of which were purchased in Georgia and sent to Brooklyn, officials said.

A Delta Air Lines baggage handler is among those accused of being involved, allegedly using his security badge to bypass screening to deliver the weapons to a smuggler.

Atlanta airport officials and federal authorities had announced there would be stricter security in place for employees after the smuggling ring was broken up.
