A teenage girl suffering from severe cystic acne has revealed the clever make-up tricks she uses to conceal the pockmarks and pimples scarring her face.

Toronto-based Elaine Mokk, 18, who is of Chinese descent, bravely appears in a YouTube video with her blotchy complexion on show - before a mix of beauty products leave her looking barely recognizable.

She says she uploaded the clip, which has to date attracted over six million views, in a bid to help others deal with the painful and debilitating skin disease.

So long, acne! Elaine Mokk, 18, from Toronto, Ontario, bravely demonstrates in a YouTube video how she conceals her blemished and pockmarked complexion with a combination of beauty products

'I really do want to share my story with everyone because I know acne affects a lot of us and I'm not alone.

'When I'm talking to someone I can see
 their eyes traveling on my face and then it just makes me feel really 
sad and I really want to cry sometimes. It makes me so insecure.

'I would love to not put on make-up - but I can't.'

First of all Ms Mokk shows how she applies a thin layer of serum all over her face.

She then applies a BB cream, which in addition to hydrating and evening out 
skin tone, also treats the skin with antioxidants or other anti-aging 
ingredients.Â

'It has great 
coverage, oil control and feels great on the skin. I do several dots on 
each area at a time and blend it in with my fingers,' the teenager says.

'I like to go back to spots that I couldn't cover up with one later. We want to even it out as much as possible first.'

She adds that it's important to be careful when applying make-up because being too heavy-handed can irritate the acne.

'If you are acne prone you should avoid buffing your face with a brush,' she warns.
