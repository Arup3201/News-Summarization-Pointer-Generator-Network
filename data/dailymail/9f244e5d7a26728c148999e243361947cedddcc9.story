It's a Cinderella story that won't have a happy ending for one alleged thief.

Police are hunting a man who left his pair of pink Adidas sneakers behind after robbing a woman near a Pennsylvania bank yesterday afternoon and fleeing on a bicycle.

'We have both his shoes,' Altoona Lieutenant Jeffrey Pratt told the Altoona Mirror. 'He ran out them prior to getting on his bike.'

The alleged offender left behind a pink pair of Adidas sneakers, which could look like these, before he fled

Lt Pratt said the robber accosted the woman as she left Altoona's Investment Savings Bank at Eighth Avenue, and snatched a white bank envelope containing about $200.

The thief then fled on a black and neon green-colored BMX-style 
bike, but bizarrely left his shoes behind.

The devastated woman ran back inside the bank to report the attack, with employees saying she was almost too distressed to speak.

Pratt told the Altoona Mirror police are 'investigating the incident as a strong-arm robbery'. 

Lt Pratt did not return Mail Online's calls.

The suspect is described as white, 
aged between 15 and 18 years old, with a thin build and light-colored 
hair, and wearing blue jeans and a dark hooded sweatshirt.

The victim was walking through an alley near an Altoona bank in this quiet town when she was accosted and robbed
