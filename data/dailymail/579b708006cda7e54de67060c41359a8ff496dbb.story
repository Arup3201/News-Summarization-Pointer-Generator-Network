Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick against Bayern Munich to keep Manchester City's Champions League hopes alive.

Before CSKA Moscow's last-gasp equaliser against Roma in Russia, City were staring another group stage exit in the face, and looked likely to need to need a win against Bayern just to stay in the competition.

Fortunately for Manuel Pellegrini's side, CSKA Moscow equalised, and Aguero's last-gasp winner for City means that three teams in Group E are level on five points.

Bayern Munich are on 12 and safely through as group winners, but for Roma, CSKA Moscow and Manchester City, it comes down to matchday six.

It's all to play for, and any of them could make it through to the knock-out stages. Here, Sportsmail explains exactly what the situation is...
