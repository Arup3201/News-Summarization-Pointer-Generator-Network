A seven-year-old leukemia survivor from California gave an impassioned speech urging his school district to endorse upcoming legislation in support of vaccination.

Rhett Krawitt may not have been big enough to reach the microphone without a chair, but he made his voice heard as he spoke of the illness he conquered. 

'For three-and-a-half years I took chemo to get the bad guys out,' the child said. 'Now I can say gone with cancer.'  

On Thursday he urged elected officials at his Martin County school to support an upcoming bill that would prevent parents from opting out of required vaccines for their children because of personal beliefs.

Rhett, with his parents, is a leukemia survivor and has been in remission for a year. His body is not yet strong enough to be immunized for measles and he must rely on protection from other vaccinated children

Rhett finished his short speech by twisting a quote from the classic film Gone With The Wind: 'Soon we will say Gone with the Measles,' according to ABC. 

'My name is Rhett and I give a damn!'

This isn't the first time Rhett and his family have spoken out. 

Last month his father, Carl, made headlines when he asked Rhett's school to bar any child from attending class if they had not been vaccinated because of the personal belief exemption.

Rhett, who has been in remission for a year, is not yet strong enough to be immunized for a number of illnesses, including the measles.

That means he depends on being surrounded by other children who are vaccinated - known as herd immunity - to keep him protected. 

But Martin County has one of the highest rates of personal belief exemption in the state, according to NPR.

Rhett's Marin County, California school has a 7 per cent exemption rate - almost 5 per cent higher than the statewide average. At least 99 Californians have been infected with measles  after a Disneyland outbreak

Rhett's school clocks in at a 7 per cent exemption rate, almost 5 per cent higher than the statewide average.

And now that a measles outbreak has hit California, with at least 99 cases reported after an infected child visited Disneyland, the possible danger Rhett faces has become all too real for his family.

'It's very emotional for me,' Carl Krewitt told NPR.

'If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice. 

'But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then ... your action has harmed my child.'

Carl also spoke to the school board on Thursday. 

'Our culture emphasizes the individual story more than the need for people to see how their choices can infringe on the health of others,' he said, according to SFgate.com

'We have an obligation to send a message. The risk of getting any of these diseases go far beyond our school.'

Rhett finished his short speech by twisting a quote from the classic film Gone With The Wind: 'Soon we will say Gone with the Measles. My name is Rhett and I give a damn!'

The Reed Union School District agreed and voted in support of the upcoming legislation that will be introduced by California Sen. Richard Pan, who is also a pediatrician.

Pan said the bill will work to halt the spread of measles throughout the state, adding 'we want to raise the immunization rate so that we can protect children like Rhett and others'.  

California, which is one of 20 states to have personal belief exemption laws, has especially come under fire recently as the vaccination debate rages on. 

A recent investigation by Wired found that six out of 12 daycares at Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google, have below-average vaccination rates.  

There was a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states, despite the fact that the disease was largely eradicated in 2000.
