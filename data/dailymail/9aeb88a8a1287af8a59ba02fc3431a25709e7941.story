Grigor Dimitrov will attempt to do in the third round of the US Open what only one player has managed in 28 matches - beat David Goffin.

It is unlikely the Belgian will make the latter stages, but no player arrived in New York with more confidence than the Goffin.

After losing to Andy Murray in the first round at Wimbledon, Goffin headed to Scheveningen in Holland to play a Challenger tournament.

Form of his life: David Goffin is on a run of just one defeat in his last 28 matches, and next faces Grigor Dimitrov

He won that, just as he did the next two Challengers he played. Then he played in Kitzbuhel and won that  too - his first title on the ATP Tour.

By the time he had come through qualifying in Winston-Salem last week and made the quarter-finals, he had won 25 successive matches.

The run was ended by Jerzy Janowicz, but Goffin remains on a roll and, after beating compatriot Niels Desein in round one, he hammered 32nd seed Joao Sousa 6-4 6-2 6-0 on Friday.

Cruising: Dimitrov outclassed Dudi Sela 6-1 6-2 6-2 in his second round match on Friday

'It's the first time I've won 25 matches in a row and now I'm in the third round for the first time in New York,' said Goffin, whose ranking has climbed from 106 to 56 in seven weeks.

'The first tournament I played in Holland, I went there to get some confidence and I had tough matches in the first and second rounds. After that it gave me some confidence.

'I won the first one, second one and then I continued to play well. I won a lot of matches, but it's not over so why not in the next match? I'm very happy with the way I played today. It was a great match.'

Goffin faces his stiffest test next in the shape of seventh seed Dimitrov, who trounced Dudi Sela 6-1 6-2 6-2.

'It's a tough match against Grigor,' he said. 

'I have nothing to lose so I'm going to do my best to win this match. It will be an exciting match on a big court so I hope there will be a good atmosphere. I will try to be aggressive like I have been this summer.'

Underdog: Goffin knows Dimitrov will be the favourite in their match on Sunday but he goes in with no fear

Goffin burst into the limelight at the French Open in 2012 when he reached the fourth round as a lucky loser and took a set off Roger Federer.

His upward curve continued for a little while, but a year later Goffin found himself back outside the top 100, the hype taking its toll.

He said: 'After that it was tough, but now the French Open is behind me and I'm looking forward. Now the most important thing is this tournament and the next tournaments in the season. I don't care what happened before.'

Elswhere Fourth seed David Ferrer was handed a walkover when opponent Bernard Tomic pulled out with hip problems.

On the rise: Dimitrov reached the semi-final at Wimbledon and is at a career-high world ranking of 8

The Australian had surgery on both hips after the Australian Open and did not want to take a risk when he felt pain in the left one following his first-round win over Dustin Brown.

Tomic, who has also been struggling with flu, said: 'I don't want to muck around with that area. For sure something is there. I've got to get it checked. It's not good right now. It's painful.'

Marin Cilic has been impressive so far, and the 14th seed's 7-6 (7/2) 6-2 6-4 victory over Ilya Marchenko set up a third-round clash with 18th seed Kevin Anderson, who came from a set down to beat Janowicz.

Gael Monfils avoided his customary drama in a 7-5 6-3 6-2 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and next meets fellow Frenchman Richard Gasquet, a 7-6 (7/4) 6-3 6-3 winner over Paolo Lorenzi.

Nineteenth seed Feliciano Lopez won in four sets against Tatsuma Ito.
