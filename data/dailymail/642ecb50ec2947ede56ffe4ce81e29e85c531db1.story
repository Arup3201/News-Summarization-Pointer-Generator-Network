The story of rural life in the hill country of North Mississippi is told in an astonishing collection of photographs taken in the early 1970s, which are now being honored with a 40-year retrospective to ensure that these images of a way of life that died out long ago may live on.

The photographs also tell the story of Michael Ford, who captured them after quitting his teaching job in Boston and packing his young family into a cherry-red Volkswagen microbus and making his home in Oxford, Mississippi.

Initially Ford's plan had been just to visit his in-laws in northern Mississippi, but he quickly became so smitten with the place that he decided to stay.

His adventure started one afternoon in 1972 when he escaped from his in-laws and in his own words discovered a world ‘so fragile and evanescent that it had to be captured now before it disappeared.’

‘I knew nothing of the South, or rural America… of cultural anthropology, ethnography, or folklife. But I learned and was given the luck, or grace perhaps, to find… oases where the past was well and alive and welcoming,’ said Ford.

Some 62 years after Marion Randolph Hall opened his blacksmith shop in Oxford 1910; Ford found himself apprenticed there as a striker ‘forging metal and building character’ for three years.

‘I’ve used something I learned in that shop almost every day,’ Ford told The New York Times. ‘Lessons in hot metal, how to treat people, resolute endurance, handiness, resourcefulness and fortitude.’

In March 2013 The Library of Congress acquired the Michael Ford Mississippi Collection. 

The
 collection consists of 16,000 feet of 16mm film, 10.5 hours of 
recordings of interviews and music, and 1000+ still photographs made 
during the production of a documentary film Homeplace in 1972-73.

The
 material will be used in a 40 year retrospective documentary presently 
in production. The archive will be housed in the same group as the Alan Lomax and Pete Seeger collection.

Ford recalls spending many months in a remote area north of Sardis Lake researching and photographing.

Some places, like the town of Chulahoma, are now listed as 'an extinct community.'

'When I took these pictures and was 
with these people I felt I was sharing a way of life that was waving its
 hand goodbye,' he said.

'There
 was no doubt that change was charging in and all, both good and bad, 
would soon be extinguished. I was here in a rural America that was at 
its end. … But even though all the places and people are gone, we can 
still call their names.'

Ford is still a blacksmith, using the
 tools Hall left him. In May, he plans to return to Mississippi to 
continue a follow-up to Homeplace. The material to be gathered on the three week shoot this 
spring will be added the Library’s holdings at a later date.
