Former Manchester City youth player Courtney Meppen-Walter has been freed from prison after eight months behind bars.

The footballer killed a brother and sister in a car crash, but compared his prison sentence to being sidelined with an 'injury' in a letter he sent while locked up.

He was jailed for 16 months in February after admitting causing the deaths of siblings Kulwant Singh, 31, and Ravel Kaur, 37, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, in a high-speed car crash.

But a letter which appears to have been written by the footballer during his time in prison has emerged in which he describes his sentence as 'just like having a four month injury'.

The letter, which features incorrect spelling and grammar, reads: 'Bro You Wanna See How Skinny I have Gone look Sexy as f*** (As Usual). Gone bare skinny and been hitting the gym, think I'm going to be going into modleing with this body when I'm out f*** football HAHAHA.'(sic)

The letter goes on to say: 'Yo its a minor being in here you know just like having a 4 month injury for me. Only 3 months left for me now, nice that!'

The former £1,000-a-week footballer was 
originally freed in July but was put back behind bars within 24 hours 
after prison service bosses realised he had been released by mistake.

The letter is understood to have been written in April, just over a month into his sentence and three months before his initial release.

Sources close to the defender say he is now looking to find a new club in a bid to ‘get his life back on track’.

But the family of the victims have criticised his release, claiming they don’t feel justice has been served.

Meppen-Walter was a former England youth captain and had been highly rated in Manchester City's academy.

At the time of his initial release in July, he had served just four months of a 16-month sentence for two counts of causing death by careless driving.

The Ministry of Justice recently completed an investigation into how the blunder occurred but have not made their findings public.

Blackley and Broughton MP Graham Stringer has now pledged to raise the case in Parliament, saying keeping details of the error secret would hit public confidence in the justice system.

Following his release last week, 
Meppen-Walter, from Blackley, tweeted about watching his former 
team-mates thrash Norwich 7-0 at the Etihad Stadium and about his desire
to put his prison sentence behind him.

He said: 'Getting my life back on track. Been a hard year but I can finally try and move forward with my life now.'

The death crash happened last September when Meppen-Walter was driving a £25,000 Mercedes Elegance CDI at nearly twice the speed limit.

He had been to a shisha bar in Manchester with friends and was on his way home to get ready for a night out.

His friends were travelling in convoy in a VW Golf and the two cars were ‘jockeying’ around for position – accelerating and swapping lanes. Witnesses said the cars were also slowing down, possibly for speed cameras, and their driving was erratic.

Meppen-Walter’s vehicle ploughed into a red Nissan Micra, killing Mr Singh and Mrs Kaur.

Mr Singh had been driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three.

He pulled out of a side road and into the path of the Mercedes, which was travelling at 56mph in a 30mph zone.

Two teenage children in the back seat suffered serious injuries and had to be cut free from the mangled wreckage, but have since made a good recovery. It emerged the double tragedy occurred five months after Meppen-Walter was caught speeding at 54mph in another 30mph zone in Bury.

The teenager, from Blackley, Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced to 16 months behind bars and also banned from the roads for three years.

The family is suing Meppen-Walter through Manchester solicitors Pannone LLP.

In a statement issued by solicitor Deirdre Healy, from Pannone, Gawa Singh, the brother of Mr Singh and Ms Kaur, said: 'The sentence that Courtney Meppen-Walter has served is nothing compared to the loss that our family have suffered. It is not justice as we understand it. Two members of our family have died. It has torn our family apart and destroyed it.'

An investigation into the blunder which saw Meppen-Walter originally released was completed last month.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Releases in error are very rare and we take any incident extremely seriously.

'An incident took place on July 1, but the prisoner was returned to custody on the same day. Following an investigation, we have reviewed our systems to reduce the risk of this happening in future.'

Mr Stringer has said he will write to the Ministry of Justice and speak in Parliament demanding the findings of the investigation are made public.
