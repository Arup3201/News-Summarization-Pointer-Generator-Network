From manager selfies to naked Dutchman to goal-line technology freezing on a winter's night at Stoke, the Premier League promises to be as enthralling as ever this season.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we're likely to see over the coming 10 months...

Arsenal set the pace, then end up off it..

Aaron Ramsey is fit and firing, Jack Wilshere is smoking hot, the World Cup winners return on a high and Alexis Sanchez is the early-season star. Yes, the Gunners will fire themselves to the top of the table and breeze through autumn. Even in early January Sportsmail will run '10 reasons why Arsenal can win the Premier League'. And then they will fall away, Arsene Wenger citing injuries and lack of depth as the cause. Does he still have Kim Kallstrom's number, we wonder?

Tony Pulis is the first manager to leave and second to be appointed...

Presuming his seat at Crystal Palace is filled in the next week, we wouldn't bet against Pulis landing the first job which becomes available in the Premier League – and that will probably be in a fortnight's time. The canny, capped coach is too good to be part of the out-of-work crowd who share the Sky Sports exposure between them. Alan Curbishley is in charge of that rota, by the way.

Great pedigree: Tony Pulis has never been relegated during his managerial career

Daniel Sturridge dances, a lot...

Luis Suarez may have gone but that just leaves more goals for Sturridge. He was one of the very few who emerged with a scrap of credit from the World Cup and – minus the distraction of the brilliant yet often selfish Suarez – Sturridge can better his 24 goals from last season. And that means one thing, let's dance...

Mover and shaker: Daniel Sturridge's dance celebration was seen on a regular occurrence last season

Ross Barkley gives us hope...

The boy will be a superstar. Barkley, still only 20, is the future of English football and this is the season when us Three Lions followers – regardless of club allegiance – are finally given hope that a better day lies ahead. He's got craft, he's got graft, he's got pace, he's got power. Steven Gerrard is gone, but a new Scouse schemer is ready to man England's midfield for the next decade.

Boy wonder: Ross Barkley will be looking to kick-on from an excellent season last term

Goal-line technology will fail...

Yes, this is the season when we debate our first glitch in the thus far flawless system. It will come on a rain-swept, wind-lashed winter's evening at Stoke with temperatures below zero, visibility low and senses numbed. Lionel Messi wouldn't fancy that and we're betting the technology doesn't either. We only hope Jonathan Pearce is commentating on the game...

Ground-breaking: Premier League will use goal-line technology for the first-time ever this season

Busy: Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech  Szczesny is notorious for posting 'selfies' on social media

Selfies, selfies, selfies...

Have you heard of selfies? No? Well you need to take a good look at yourself, preferably with a camera phone. Dressing-room selfies, on-the-pitch selfies, out-and-about selfies – and that's just Arsenal's Wojciech 'selfie' Szczesny. This, however, is the season we see our first manager selfie. Yes, rather than the traditional pre-match handshake, we're betting Jose Mourinho whips out his mobile and gets a snap of himself and Arsene Wenger which will be posted to Twitter before the game has even kicked off...

Big Sam survives (again)...

He'll do enough, he always does. Despite supporter unrest and boardroom murmurings, Sam Allardyce will preserve his employment by winning just enough matches in which his side have 'nullified the opposition's strengths and exposed their weaknesses' (type that into Google, see how many Allardyce quotes you get)...

Standing tall: Sam Allardyce will keep West Ham up next season, despite his style of football

VIDEO We have to hit the ground running - Allardyce 

Manchester City set new record for foreign XIs...

We saw it last week in the Community Shield, City failing to field an English player from the off. And with Joe Hart seemingly out of favour and James Milner never in favour, good old Frank Lampard could be fighting our corner at the Etihad. He's off to New York in January, however, and the likelihood is that the majority of City's starting elevens this season will consist entirely of overseas players. And this is from the English champions....

Foreign pact: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini failed to start an Englishman against Arsenal on Sunday

Peace in the North-East...

Finally, on a more sombre note, the death of Newcastle fans Liam Sweeney and John Alder in the MH17 disaster has united the North-East. A fund set up by a Sunderland fan raised more than £30,000 in their memory and former Black Cats goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery will represent the club when tributes are paid at St James' Park this weekend. 

The first Tyne-Wear derby of the season does not come until December, but it should mark the first occasion when the rival supporters applaud each other as a show of respect before the game. Then, of course, the action on the pitch starts...

Touching: Sunderland have raised funds in memory of two Newcastle fans who died during the MH17 disaster

Louis van Gaal drops his pants in the Old Trafford dressing-room...

By way of a motivational tactic, it's probably the best we've ever come across. Disillusioned with his Bayern Munich stars, Van Gaal dropped his pants to prove he had the 'balls' to axe any of them. And as good as United have looked in pre-season, it will only take a couple of defeats for last season's self-doubt to resurface. That could well see Van Gaal lose his rag, and his trousers.

High hopes: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will be aiming to turn around the club's fortunes
