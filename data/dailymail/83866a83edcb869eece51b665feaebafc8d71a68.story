Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a Boeing 737 plane crashed into the tarmac and burst into flames, killing all 50 passengers and crew on board.

The video shows the plane descending in a steep dive before exploding in a giant fireball on the runway the Russian city of Kazan yesterday.

The chilling video was broadcast today by Russian television stations.

The Tatarstan Airlines plane was making its second attempt at a landing, according to Alexander Poltinin, head of the local branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, who said investigators are looking into possible pilot error or equipment failure.

The traffic controller at the Kazan airport who contacted the plane before the crash said the crew told him they were not ready to land as it was approaching but did not specify the problem.

The brief video taken by an airport security camera showed the plane going down at high speed at a nearly vertical angle and then hitting the ground and exploding.

Fragments of the plane littered the tarmac and fire crews spent hours extinguishing the blaze. Poltinin said it could take weeks to identify the remains.

Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the crash and have recovered the black box recorder

The investigators have found both of the plane's black boxes but said they were damaged. The boxes contain the recording of its systems performance and crew conversations and are essential for the crash probe.

Magomed Tolboyev, a highly decorated Russian test pilot, said on Rossiya television that it wasn't immediately clear why the crew was unable to land on their first try in good weather, saying it could be linked to a failure of some of the plane's systems or a crew error.

Investigators on Monday started looking through the company's records as part of the crash probe.

The plane was built 23 years ago and had seen service with seven other carriers prior to being commissioned by Tatarstan Airlines.

In 2001, it was damaged in a landing accident in Brazil that injured no one. The aircraft has been in service with Tatarstan Airlines since 2008.

The company insisted that the aircraft was in good condition for the flight.

A fuel tank was said to have exploded as the plane came down.

The 
plane, which took off from Domodedovo airport in Moscow, crashed at 
7.20pm, or 3.20pm GMT, today, at the airport in Kazan, located in Tatarstan, in the in the
 west of the country.

A spokesman for the Russian 
Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, said there were 44 passengers and 
six crew members aboard and all had been killed.

'The plane made several attempts to land,' she said.

'During the final attempt, one of the fuel tanks exploded.'

The carrier has had a good safety record, but appears to have run into financial problems recently.

Its personnel went on strike in 
September over back wages, and the Kazan airport authority has gone to 
arbitration to claim what it said was Tatarstan Airlines' debt for 
servicing its planes.

Former
 Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said the government should tighten its 
oversight of carriers and subsidize the upgrading of their fleets to 
improve flight safety, according to remarks Monday on the Prime news 
agency.

The son of the
 provincial governor and the chief of the local branch of Russia's main 
security agency were among the victims, as was British academic, Donna 
Bull. 

Colleagues said today that Ms Bull was 'a very popular and well-respected member of staff' at Bellerbys College in Cambridge.

James Pitman, managing director for 
Study Group's higher education division - Bellerbys College and 
International Study Centres - confirmed Ms Bull's death and that of her 
Moscow-based colleague.

In a
 statement, he said: 'We have received confirmation of the very sad news
 that our Bellerbys colleagues Donna Bull and Yana Baranova were on the 
plane that crashed in the Russian city of Kazan yesterday.

'Donna
 had flown out from the UK to Moscow earlier in the day, where she met 
Yana, and the two were heading to Kazan for the start of a 10-day 
marketing trip.'

Mrs Bull lived in Cambridge with her 
family. Her husband was too upset to comment yesterday and said: 'I 
don't think we're going to say anything today.'

Russia's
 last deadly airliner crash was in December, when a Russian-made Tupolev
 belonging to Red Wings airline careered off the runway at Moscow's 
Vnukovo airport. It rolled across a snowy field and slammed into the 
slope of a highway, killing five of its eight crew onboard.

A 2011 crash in Yaroslavl killed 44 people including a professional hockey team and was blamed on pilot error.

Scene: The crash happened as the plane was coming into Kazan Airport, located around 450 miles east of Moscow, where the flight originated
