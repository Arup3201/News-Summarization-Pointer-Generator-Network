A compulsive MI5 impersonator is facing a life sentence for the brutal murder of an Italian pensioner.

Jason Marshall, 26, a council worker from Greenwich, south London, is accused of strangling the retired tour guide to death with an electric cable at his home in a suburb of Rome in February last year.

The naked body of Vincenzo Iale, 68, was found face down in a pool of blood, in the bedroom of his home, in the seaside resort of Torvajanica, the court heard. The father-of-one had been stabbed dozens of times. 

Accused: Jason Marshall, 26, from Greenwich, London, is accused of strangling Vincenzo Iale, 68, to death with a cable in his seaside home near Rome after meeting him in a gay chat room

On arrest Marshall, who had met Mr Iale online, told Italian police he had diplomatic immunity, as an MI5 operative working at the British Embassy in Rome. 

The Briton had previously masqueraded as a secret services operative in London where he patrolled the Underground carrying out self appointed drug detection operations and issuing fines.

He was handed an eight-month suspended sentence in 2010 after officials became suspicious of the ‘sniffer dog’, his pet Scottish terrier.

Investigators say Mr Marshall, a former employee of Newham Council, tortured the pensioner to get his bank PIN code, after meeting him online in gay chatroom Badoo.

The Londoner is charged with murder, as well as the theft of Mr Iale’s car and credit card, which he allegedly used to take out €2,000.

Carabinieri officer Pippo Bisignani told the court: ‘The body was visible from the door, naked and face down with his hands behind his back. There was an electrical cord round his neck.’

Police marshall Luca Doganieri said: ‘Blood was splattered in the kitchen and bathroom and the body appeared to have been dragged along the corridor into the bedroom, leaving a red mark’.

Marshall was held after a second man, hotel manager Umberto Gismondi, identified him as the person who, invited to his apartment via an online gay website, attacked him with pepper spray, beat him with a truncheon and attempted to suffocate him with a cushion.

These were the items seized from the scene forming part of the case in Italy. On arrest, Marshall told Italian police he had diplomatic immunity because he was an MI5 agent

The attacker fled after neighbours heard the screams of the victim and called police – who then tracked down Marshall via his mobile phone.

Gismondi said he asked Marshall why he was carrying a gun – which turned out to be a replica -- and was told he 'worked undercover for MI5 at the British Embassy in Rome'.

During a dramatic outburst in court today, Marshall attempted to invoke European law, claiming that the British Ambassador had advised him that the slow progress of the Italian legal process was in breach of his human rights.

As judges deliberated over the dates of the next hearings, Marshall, unshaven and dressed in a grey sweatshirt, shouted from a cage in the court:

'It’s against European law,' he said. ‘What is wrong with this country? You promised me it would be over in one or two weeks. What is wrong with this country?

Marshall, who is currently detained in a psychiatric hospital in Naples, faces a possible life sentence, his lawyer Francesco Bruschini told the Mail.

He added: ‘However, he could be eligible for a reduction because he suffers from psychosis, delusions, Aspergers and borderline personality disorder.’

A court-commissioned psychiatrist’s report said that Marshall was ‘a danger to society’ and ‘needed round the clock health care.’
