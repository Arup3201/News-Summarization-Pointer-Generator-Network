Stung: Loyal energy customers are being overcharged by around £150 a year so the major firms can fund cut-price deals for new clients, MPs have been told

Loyal energy customers are being overcharged by around £150 a year so the major firms can fund cut-price deals for new clients, MPs have been told.

The Big Six have been accused of a 'predatory' pricing strategy which means 85 per cent of existing customers are paying too much because they don't change suppliers.

New customers are then finding that their costs rapidly increase when any temporary offer ends, the Commons Energy Committee heard.

Labour MP John Robertson told the 
power giants at the committee: 'There are 85 per cent of customers who don't switch. What
do they get for being loyal?

'The perception is you’re a bunch of 
money-grabbing so and sos.'

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Robertson later said many poorer families found they were unable to switch suppliers because they had debts with their existing company.

He said: 'If they have got themselves into a debt of, say, £200, they can't get out of the contract they are already in.

'If they were to switch, they could pay back that debt within a year with any savings they make. They are the ones who need it most, but they are the ones who don't get it.'

Earlier at the committee, the tactics by the Big Six — British Gas, E.On, Npower, EDF, SSE and Scottish Power — were branded 'predatory' by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of Ovo Energy.

According
to The Sun, he said: 'It is a £30billion market and 
nobody wants to enter it — that’s the measure of competition.

'Energy companies should not be allowed to have a large difference between their lowest cost and average cost.'

Bosses at the Big Six denied 
exploiting loyal customers to pay for introductory discounts and said it
was up to clients to seek out the best deals.

NPower
director David Mannering denied any responsibility for the furore and 
urged customers to 'trust' him not to offer rip-off prices, it was 
reported in the Daily Mirror.

He said: 'The problem is, whenever there 
is a price rise announced, there are pundits who say, "How can they do 
this, they are just profiteering".'

But EDF director Martin Lawrence admitted the big six had been 'too clever' by trying to maximise profits in the past.

He said: '[Have we] woken up and smelt the coffee? I think you’re right.'

Guy Esnouf of E.On said: 'We need to move towards an approach that says, "Look, let’s together reduce these prices".'

Last month, hard-pressed British families were warned they are now going to be £200 a year worse off until at least 2014.

Rising fuel, energy and mortgage costs are crippling disposable incomes as salaries are not rising enough to keep up with over-inflated prices.

Investment bank Morgan Stanley say that the average UK household is already £50 worse off in 2012 and it will only get more painful, with a total fall in disposable income of £1.3 billlion this year, reaching £5 billion by the end of 2013.
