Heidi Klum got a taste of the elusive Cronut yesterday, flying a box of the crossiant-donut hybrids to her home in Los Angeles on a private jet.

Hundreds of New Yorkers wait in line as early as 6am to get their hands on one of the Dominique Ansel Bakery treats, and it seems that the supermodel had to wait just like everyone else.

'I have literally waited weeks to try one of @DominiqueAnsel's Cronuts and it was definitely worth the wait!' wrote the 40-year-old on Twitter.

First class Cronuts: Heidi Klum got a taste of the elusive Cronut yesterday, flying a box of the donut-crossiant hybrids home with her on a private jet

Usually, there is a two-Cronut-per-person limit on in-store purchases, but instead of waiting in the long lines that start outside the bakery as early as two hours prior to opening, Ms Klum was lucky enough to secure a spot on the pre-order list - which has a six-per-person limit.

'Heidi's crew were first rate citizens,' Amy Ma, the press representative for Dominique Ansel Bakery, told MailOnline.

'They called two weeks in advanced for pre-orders like everyone else did, and waited fairly for them.

'Not to mention they were also extremely polite. We're thrilled and grateful that Heidi enjoyed the Cronut. We're all big fans!'

With four excited children eagerly awaiting their chance to try a Cronut, made from deep fried thin layers of 
flaky croissant dough filled
with Tahitian vanilla cream, the supermodel spared no expense in getting them home.

'Flying
back home with a box of #cronuts for my loved ones,' she tweeted, 
posting a photo of the Cronut box safely buckled in its own seat.

Every Monday at 11am, the bakery opens up 
pre-orders by phone only, for up to two weeks in advance. (For 
Monday, August 12th, we open up orders for the week of August 26th to 
September 1st).

'If the phone is busy
or has a “mailbox if full” message, we are simply on the call with 
another customer, please do call back,' the bakery's website states. 'Pre-order lists fill up very 
quickly. . . we can only take 
one pre-order per call.'

After the success of the Cronut - which was quietly unveiled on
May 10 with a small batch of 50, and by May 13, had sold out of 200 by 
9.30am - the French chef said business is booming.

'We definitely increased business to meet the demands of customers, to serve them the best we can every morning,' said Mr Ansel.

But
he has no plans to open another store, despite the hundreds of 
customers - including Martha Stewart and Ms Klum - who continue to wait for a chance to try the Cronut.

Taking advantage of the Cronut's popularity, the bakery recently held a Cronut Project, auctinging off two of the pastries each day to raise money for Food Bank.

With just 13 Cronuts, the bakery raised nearly $6,000.
