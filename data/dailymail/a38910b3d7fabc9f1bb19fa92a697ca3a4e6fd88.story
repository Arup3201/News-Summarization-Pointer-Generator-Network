One man, aged 24, died shortly afterwards, while the other, 25, is in a critical but stable condition. A third 30-year-old man arrived at the hospital soon afterwards with stab wounds

Witnesses say the men's late-night arrival at Liverpool Hospital was 'chaotic' and forced the emergency department 'into lockdown'. 

A 30-year-old arrived at the hospital soon afterwards with stab wounds, and also remains in a serious but stable condition.

Due to the short timeframe between the men appearing at hospital, police are investigating a possible link between the incidents.

Initial information led police to Bigge Park in Liverpool but after a search of the area no crime scene has been established.

Police are investigating the likelihood all three stabbings are linked.
