The victim, whose name and age have not been released, has no vision in his right eye. 

The man and a witness identified the McDonald's employee.  

Haynes was arrested at his mother's home last week and charged on Sunday. He is being held on $40,000 bail.  

Haynes, who has been married for four years and has children, posted several pictures of himself and the Incredible Hulk on social media two days after the alleged attack.

One Facebook post read: 'U wouldn't like me when I'm mad..'

In a statement, the Chicago McDonald's owner and operator, Ron Lofton, told Daily Mail Online: 'Nothing is more important to me than the safety and well-being of my customers and employees. This was an isolated incident, and the individual in question is no longer employed by my organization.

'We are fully cooperating with the Chicago Police department during their investigation, however, as this is a pending police matter, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.'
