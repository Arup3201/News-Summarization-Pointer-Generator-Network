Sprawled out on the sand in a world of their own, this weird and wonderful bunch of sun worshipers proves there's nothing quite like a day on the beach to forget yourself.

Photographer Tadao Cern was so taken by the bizarre assortment of characters he encountered during a seaside holiday in Lithuania, he  had to race off and fetch his camera equipment.

The pictures he took that day now form a collection he has named Comfort Zone, which goes on display at a Berlin gallery early next month.

Mr Cern says he is intrigued by how people, who may otherwise be embarrassed or ashamed of their bodies suddenly seem happy to let everything hang out once they get to the beach.

He said: 'During our everyday life we attempt to hide our deficiencies, both physical and psychological. 

'However, once we find ourselves on a beach – we forget about everything and start acting in an absolutely different manner. Is that because everyone else around you is doing the same?

Photographer Tadao Cern is intrigued by the way people seem to lose their inhibitions as soon as they get on the beach 

'If yes, I would love that the same rules were applied beyond the borders of the beach – people would care less about what others may think about them. 

'I believe that this in turn would show how different, interesting and beautiful we truly are. The deeper you dig, the greater possibilities arise. And the more you think – the more you question and ponder.' 

Mr Cern admits he did not ask permission before taking the pictures but the subjects' faces are obscured so they are not identified.

He added: 'These photos are not staged and people did not suspect that I was photographing them. 

'I chose to capture images of sleeping vacationers because it accurately represents the name of the project ‘Comfort Zone’. 

'Here are only the photos with hidden faces to get an observer the opportunity to calmly scrutinize each and every detail without being distracted.'
