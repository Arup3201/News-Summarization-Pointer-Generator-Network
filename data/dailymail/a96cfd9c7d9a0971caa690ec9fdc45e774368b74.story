Yaasmeen, who is the mother to a four-month-old baby girl is now covered in bandages and fighting for her life in the burns unit at UC Irvine Medical Center.

'It can be considered a burn from the inside out because of mucosal involvement,' said dermatologist Dr. Lawrence Matt. 

'First of all, don't share medication, don't give someone else your medication, don't offer medication,' she said. 'Another thing also, go get yourself checked out and your kids checked out, because you don't know what you're allergic to.'
