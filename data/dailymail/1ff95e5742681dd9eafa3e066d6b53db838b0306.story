As more and more people are becoming obese, a council has resorted to expanding the size of its graves to accommodate bigger bodies.

Rochford Council in Essex, where more than a quarter of the adult population is classified as obese, has agreed to expand average grave sizes by 10 per cent in a bid to cater for larger bodies.

The town suffers from above average adult obesity rates and some cemeteries have already struggled to fit some larger coffins into the 9ft by 4ft graves currently provided.

Keith Gordon, Rochford councillor responsible for environment and leisure, said: 'The plots have been increased in size to give everybody a chance.

'The actual graves are getting bigger, as you can appreciate, because some people are getting larger.

'I think it’s something that’s been noticed by councils all over the place, that people are getting bigger.'

It comes after many undertakers started providing the option of 'super-size coffins' for larger bodies.

Some funeral parlours in Britain have even had to install hoists capable of lifting
50 stone, purchase reinforced steel trollies and increase the size of their fridges in order to manage larger corpses.

Hospital morgues and crematoriums have 
already had to make alterations to deal with the changes, such as 
installing extra-large furnaces.

Wide: Larger coffins that are needed to house obese bodies

While a standard casket typically 
measures between 24 and 27 inches wide, manufacturers are now producing 
boxes as wide as 52 inches, capable of fitting a person weighing up to 
1,000 pounds.

The move comes despite a shortage of space in graveyards across the country which has led to councils considering ‘reusing’ old grave sites.

Experts have labeled the space 
shortage a crisis with a recent survey revealing some councils could run
out of burial space within the next 20 years.

Mr
Gordon went onto explain that two plots can be bought to accommodate 
extremely large coffins although a two foot separation between graves is
needed to prevent collapse.

He added: 'You can end up with a collapse if you’re not careful, I think that’s uppermost in people’s minds.'

Wide load: Obesity is forcing ambulance bosses to revamp their fleets to cope with obese patients

Among the improvements are specially-strengthened stretchers capable of expanding to take extra weight and motorised stretchers to help staff lift heavy patients

Ambulance bosses have also started paying out millions to ‘supersize’ their vehicles to cope with the growing number of obese casualties.

The
East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) is to introduce a fleet of 128 
larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to
55st.

Its fleet of bigger vehicles, known as ‘bariatric ambulances’, have larger doors and more space inside.

They have also been fitted with 
specially-strengthened stretchers capable of expanding to take extra 
weight, motorised stretchers to help staff lift heavy patients, wider ramps and larger chairs.

Statistics released by Public Health 
England in September 2013 showed 24.2 per cent of England’s adult 
population suffer from obesity.
