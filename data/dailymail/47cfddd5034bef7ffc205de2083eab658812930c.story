A mother-of-two has shared she learned her photo was among pictures kept by a serial killer while watching a History Channel documentary, she has revealed.

The woman, only identified as 'Mo', was stunned to see the image that her former neighbor, Lonnie Franklin, Jr., had taken of her on the television. The image had been among scores of photos of other women found in his possession when he was arrested in 2010.

She then learned that Franklin had been accused of carrying out  10 killings across the Los Angeles area over two decades and was known as 'the Grim Sleeper'. He goes on trial this June.

Speaking to ABC7, Mo said she was lucky to be alive following an incident with him in 2006.

Shock: Mo said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor

She said Franklin had seemed friendly when they lived beside each other and took a photo of the then-26-year-old outside her home - the image that later showed up among police files.

One evening, he asked her to go for a ride in his van and, thinking they were friends, she agreed.

But while on the journey he asked to take photos of her naked and showed her other images he had taken of women, she told ABC7.

'When he showed me the pictures I asked him why are they in weird positions, and they look dead,' she said. 'He told me they wasn't, that's just how he have them take pictures.'

She said she then noticed a gun and van inside the van so she agreed to the pictures, fearing he would hurt her if she did not.

After the incident, she told no one because she was embarrassed about the images and she forced the thought from her mind - until she watched the documentary over the weekend. 

'When my picture popped up it was like, "Oh my God!" It was shocking,' she said.

Mo, whose image was among photos of other women who are feared to be his victims, added that she believes she also could have been killed by him.  

'He's a monster,' she told ABC7.

She has been in contact with the Los Angeles Police Department, who are looking into her story.

Franklin, 62, has has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder and will stand trial on June 29, it was announced last month following years of delays. 

Franklin could face the death penalty if convicted of the murder between 1985 and 2007. He was given the nickname 'Grim Sleeper' because of the gap between slayings in 1988 and 2002.

Police arrested Franklin in July 2010 after his DNA was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes.

They had linked the crimes, but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of Franklin's family members.

Probe: A 2010 photo shows items being removed from his home after his DNA matched with cold cases

An officer posing as a busboy at a pizza parlor got DNA samples from dishes and utensils Franklin had been eating with at a birthday party.

As news of the trial date has been announced, attorney Nina Salarno Ashford, a board member of Crime Victims United, said it is not unusual for capital cases to take years to complete.  

Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman said the case has been plagued by delays and that the judge has failed to hold the defense to strict deadlines to complete their investigation.

But defense lawyer Seymour Amster blamed the prosecution, and said his expert found DNA from another man at three of the crime scenes and is seeking to test more material. 

A firearms expert who tested guns retired last year, so the testing needed to be done again, while medical examiners at the coroner's office have retired and will also need to be replaced.
