Just what is handball? That must be the question for players, managers and fans after the first games of the new Premier League season.

Mike Dean was correct when he waved away Manchester United’s penalty appeals in the dying minutes of their defeat at home against Swansea when the ball hit Angel Rangel. The full back was very close to the opponent and had his body turned away so it really was a case of unintentional handball.

Down at West Ham Chris Foy and his assistant felt differently. Foy, after a long consultation with his assistant, gave a penalty for handball and dismissed Kyle Naughton for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity.

Harsh: Chris Foy was right to give a penalty, but Naughton's dismissal was harsh 

Naughton was very close to Kevin Nolan as the West Ham man fired towards goal but as the Tottenham defender had his hands raised in what is termed as unnatural position I could see why a penalty was awarded.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino agreed, as I did with him when he felt the red card that followed was harsh. The offence defines that the opportunity must be obvious and I cannot see an angle which shows that the ball was definitely on target or that Hugo Lloris might not have saved the effort. Where doubt exists the referee really should not dismiss a player and I think Spurs have a case to appeal the red card.

Finally on to Loftus Road and another handball incident when Hull’s James Chester was deemed to have deliberately handled Junior Hoilett’s cross in the penalty area. Again, he was very close to the ball when it was kicked and his arms were in a natural position, but referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot.

Justice: Charlie Austin misses the penalty awarded for handball that didn't touch Chester's hands or arms

I felt the decision was wrong and therefore a natural justice was served when Allan McGregor saved Charlie Austin’s penalty.

These incidents highlighted an inconsistency in the judgement of handball which will cause issues as the season progresses unless resolved by referee chief Mike Riley.

Hull manager Steve Bruce rightly pointed out that there has been no tinkering to the wording of the law dealing with handball but there has been a clear change in decision-making, with referees receiving more advice on the definition of handball. What that has led to appears to be unnecessary confusion for all involved.

Handball remains the only offence which in the law needs to have a degree of intent; have a look at James Chester’s ‘offence’ and ask yourself if there was really an intention to handle the ball? 

Impressive: Mike Dean had a performed well when officiating between Mancghester United and Swansea

Penalty: Victor Anichebe also won a particularly soft penalty against Sunderland
