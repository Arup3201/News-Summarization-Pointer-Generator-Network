The Bridgegate controversy seems to spiraling out of control for Chris Christie as more politicians come forward to offer their view on the scandal, with one state senator calling him ‘Liar-in-Chief’.

New Jersey Democrat Ray Lesniak said the scathing remarks on the Saturday morning television show, Up with Steve Kornacki.

‘The Liar-in-Chief is Chris Christie, and the obstruction of justice is what is going to be his biggest problem. I don’t believe he was involved in the lane closures itself, but those lane closures violate federal law,’ said State Senator Lesniak.

He said Christie ‘circled the wagons, had a phony story about a traffic study no one could believe. Lo and behold, the morning we found out it was a phony story, he found out. What he found out was that we found out.’

But not everyone is turning their back on Christie, just yet.

On Sunday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended the governor, but said he is putting his political future in jeopardy should evidence surface that he had any knowledge of his aides’ alleged actions in the George Washington Bridge scandal.

‘He says he didn’t know. I think it’s pretty darn credible. He wouldn’t make this blanket denial unless it’s not true,’ Giuliani told ABC News.

‘If, for some reason, it’s not true, the man has put his political career completely at risk if it turns out there is some evidence that he knew about it.

‘He’s taken the complete risk that his political career is over. I don’t think he’d do that if there’s any suggestion he knew about this.’

During the interview, the former mayor talked about how Christie was unaware of a major traffic jam in New Jersey during the height of his re-election to the Obama administration.

He also mentioned how the governor was caught off guard the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.

‘And the reality is, things go wrong in an administration. And frankly, you know, he was in campaign-mode at the time, during campaign-mode you miss a lot of things. You’re not paying as much attention. We see that with Benghazi,’ Giuliani said.

‘After the fact, it seems like how didn’t they know? But the reality is you miss a lot of things when you’re running a government that’s as complicated as New Jersey, New York or the United States,’ Giuliani added.

‘This has happened to many presidents, many governors, many mayors. It’s happened to the present president at three or four times where he said I didn’t know. And then the press says, gosh, how could he not have known?’

Chris Christie, pictured on Thursday, denied he had any prior knowledge of the bridge plan. He could be impeached if found guilty

Christie could be impeached if the team investigating the 'Bridgegate' 
scandal find he knew the motive behind the George Washington Bridge 
closures.

Assemblyman John 
Wisniewski, who is leading the investigation, said he doesn't find 
Christie's denials credible when so many of his close aides appeared to 
be involved.

Christie, 
who was widely tipped to run for president in 2016, has denied any prior
 knowledge of an apparent plan to use lane closures on the bridge as 
payback against a mayor who failed to endorse his re-election.

Mr Wisniewski told NBC he
 found it hard to accept Christie knew nothing until the morning of the 
press conference he held on Thursday, when he said he had been 'stunned 
by the abject stupidity' of the plan.

Investigation: John Wisniewski, who is leading the bridge inquiry, says he didn't find Christie's denials credible

'These people travel with him, these 
people discuss things with him every single day. This is not an 
isolated, unknown story,' Mr Wisniewski said of Christie's aides, who were named in the emails and text messages.

'He knew there was an investigation. He knew
 people were looking at it, and his senior staff was involved [and] he 
expects us to believe he knew nothing? I just find that implausible.'

He added: 'Using
 the George Washington Bridge, a public resource, to exact a political 
vendetta, is a crime ... Having people use their official 
position to have a political game is a crime. So if those tie back to 
the governor in any way, it clearly becomes an impeachable offense.'

A special session is due to be held on Thursday to re-authorize subpoena power for the investigative committee.

Many are at odds over whether Governor Christie, who was tipped to run for President in 2016, was involved

Governor Christie is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a Democratic mayor

Mr Wisniewski says he 
plans to use that power to subpoena official and private emails, text 
messages and other documents from current and former aides, before 
calling them in 'one by one' to testify.

Assembly speaker-elect Vincent Prieto, who will head the session on Thursday, told CNN the revelations 'clearly show the need for a continued thorough investigation'.

'Many questions remain unanswered about this threat to public safety and abuse of power,' he added.

Christie's
 press secretary, Mike Drewniak, did not respond to NBC requests for 
comment. The Republican governor is still expected to visit Florida next
 week to help with Governor Rick Scott's re-election campaign.

New Jersey residents also think Christie is lying about Bridgegate, and think he should quit a poll found.

The poll, conducted on 800 likely voters after
 Christie’s press conference. by Rasmussen Reports, found that 54 per 
cent of the Garden State’s residents think he knew what was going on.

And 56 per cent said he 
should resign if it is proven that he approved of the tactic to 
retaliate against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to 
endorse Christie’s re-election, according to the poll released by the New York Post.

Only
 36 per cent believe Christie’s claim that he was unaware that a top 
aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington
 Bridge access lanes, the survey showed.

The
 survey also found that 71 per cent suspect that other political figures
 who failed to back Christie had been targeted by the governor’s staff, according to the poll published by the New York Post.

And
 47 per cent believed that members of Christie’s staff who ordered the 
closing should be criminally prosecuted, while 31 per cent said they 
should not.

A poll taken
 by Quinnipiac University immediately before the bridge scandal found 
Christie was the 
‘hottest’ politician in the country when it came to ‘warmth’ and 
favorability, according to the Post.

Last week it was claimed that aides to Christie 
knew traffic closures they spitefully ordered on the George Washington 
Bridge were putting lives at risk after just a few hours – but carried 
on snarling traffic for another four days.

In a lengthy press briefing on Thursday, Christie forcefully denied any involvement.

A port authority employee warned  the bridge lane closures created safety risks, but they continued for four days
