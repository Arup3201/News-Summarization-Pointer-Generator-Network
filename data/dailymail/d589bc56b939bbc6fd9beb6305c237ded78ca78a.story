Officers examined the property and found the shotgun that was used to kill Mr Tan in the family's garage. On Tuesday morning, Charles was arraigned on a second-degree murder charge.

Police had been called the home in Coach Side Lane in the upscale suburb several times in the past for reported domestic incidents, Monroe County Sheriff's Office told the Democrat & Chronicle.

Audio recordings of emergency calls, obtained by the newspaper, indicate that Charles - who is a member of Cornell's Sprint Football team - initially said he was defending himself from his father.

Speaking from the scene on Monday night, Chief Deputy Drew Forsythe said deputies had first been called to the scene   after neighbors heard shouting coming from within the property.

'While en route to the call, there was additional information there was a shooting at the residence. Upon arrival, the deputies found both the male and female in the driveway,' Chf Forsythe said.

Father's workplace: Mr Tan  previously worked at Eastman Kodak Co. for 20 years. His current company, Dynamax Imaging, is based at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (pictured) in Canandaigua

'They were then taken down to our headquarters to be interviewed. We believe they are both occupants of the residence. We don't know the circumstances surrounding [the shooting] yet.'   

Mr Tan -  also president of Dynamax Imaging - previously worked at Eastman Kodak Co. for 20 years. The company he was working at when he died specializes in manufacturing image sensors.

In 2013, Dynamax announced that it was moving to its current location, the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Campus Drive, Canandaigua, in its bid to expand.

Charles is scheduled to appear in court on Friday. Police are investigating.
