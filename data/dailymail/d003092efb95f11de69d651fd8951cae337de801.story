A senior North Korean diplomat has revealed new details about why Kim Jong-Un's uncle was executed.

North Korea's ambassador to the UK, Hyun Hak-Bong, said the dictator's former political confidant and close relative Jang Song Thaek had been guilty of 'tremendous crimes against the country'.

Speaking for the first time about the purge which sent shockwaves around the globe, the diplomat revealed Jang had been killed by firing squad but his family and political supporters may have survived the crackdown.

Kim had described his uncle  –
 who was married to his father’s sister – as a traitor, a womaniser and a
 ‘despicable human scum – worse than a dog’.

Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime, the state broadcaster claimed.

But very few other detail had emerged from the secretive nuclear state.

Today Mr Hal-Bong told Sky News: 'He made anti-party, anti-government crimes, and as well he abused his power in hindering the national economy and hindering the efforts of the national economy and for improving people's living standards.

He claimed Jang had stolen €4.6million from the people in 2009 alone and been repeatedly pardoned by the party and Kim.

But
 he said that the party's patience had run out with Jang, adding: 'He 
made tremendous crimes against the government, against the people, 
against the country.'

The ambassador also tried to dismiss reports that the Jang - unceremoniously marched out of a Central Committee of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang in December, last year, and quickly executed - had been fed to a pack of wild dogs and members of his family and political supporters had been killed during a bloody purge.

Mr Hak-bong told Sky News these rumours were propaganda put about by North Korea's enemies.

More than 100 members of Jang's family were reported to have been killed or arrested following Jang's swift punishment.

A news website for North Korean defectors, Daily NK, reported that members of Jang's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death.

Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren were condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea.

Among those allegedly executed were Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons.

The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers are also said to have been killed.

Mr Hal-bong said he could not be sure, but he thought they were probably not executed.

He also used the interview with a British news organisation to demand South Korea to cancel an upcoming joint military exercise with the U.S. as a way of calming nuclear tensions in the region.
