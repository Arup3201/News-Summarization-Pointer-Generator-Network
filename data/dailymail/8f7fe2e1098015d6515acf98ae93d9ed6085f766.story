This is the shocking moment a tourist was knocked unconscious with a single blow to the head while fighting with a taxi driver in Thailand.

Eyewitnesses said the holidaymaker, from South Korea, rowed with the motorcycle driver after he allegedly refused to pay his bill at a bar and cab fare in the beach resort of Pattaya.

The confrontation, which was captured on camera by at a customer at a bar, escalated when the tourist threatened to hit the driver with his crash helmet on the pavement outside the business.

A 40-second clip posted on YouTube by Spring News shows the tourist raising his crash helmet and lunging towards the driver, who raises his arm to protect himself.

The tourist stops and casually tosses the crash helmet over the driver’s head as music blares in the background and customers shout at them.

As they square off the tourist kicks at the driver, whose cocks his right fist as the holidaymaker backs off.

After trading kicks the tourist looks down at the driver’s leg and is knocked flat on his back by a single punch to the chin.

Customers inside the bar and people on the street cheered and applauded, and car horns sounded the moment the tourist was knocked out.

Eyewitnesses said the tourist skipped out on a £30 bar tab but returned and got into a fight with the driver

Jongrak Thiengmak, an employee at Ann’s Bar, where the fight occurred Wednesday night, claimed the tourist got drunk and refused to pay his bill.

He told Thaivisa News that the man left the bar, owing 1,500 baht (£30), and returned an hour later and fought with the taxi driver over an unpaid fare of 200 baht (£4).

After he was punched the tourist, who suffered a bloodied nose and lost a tooth, was unconscious for three minutes, Thaivisa News reported.

Jongrak told the news website that bar employees used ice to stop the bleeding and escorted the tourist to his hotel.

The man returned to the bar last night and paid his bill to avoid criminal charges.
