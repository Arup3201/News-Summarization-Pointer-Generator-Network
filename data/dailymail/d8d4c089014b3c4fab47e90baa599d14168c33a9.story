A school in Britain has become the first in Europe to teach pupils while they are standing up, it was revealed today.

Nine and ten-year-old pupils at Grove House Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, are taking part in a pilot - run by local medical researchers in a bid to improve concentration and health.

The seven-week scheme will see pupils take it in turn to stand behind six desks while the others sit down as usual, with each student spending a carefully-calculated 230 minutes standing each week.

The trial is designed to assess the impact on concentration of sitting for long periods of time - and what effects it can have on children’s health.

Schools in Australia, New Zealand and the US have already tried the idea, but the Year Five children at Grove House Primary are thought to be the first in Europe to use the innovative desks.

Teacher Hannah Rogers, 28, said: ‘The pupils have been so excited to take part in this experiment, and they absolutely love it.

‘We’ve only been doing it two weeks in my class and already I can see an improvement. I’ve got a very active class and I think they’re really responding to having more freedom.

Test: The pupils' weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference and fine motor skills are being taken during the experiment, and the results will be compared at the end

‘It keeps them focused. They’re 
working better, their concentration is better, and when given the 
option, they want to continue standing rather than going back to 
sitting.

The year group of 55 pupils whose parents gave permission for them to take part in the trial was divided into two.

The first half used the standing desks for seven weeks from February to the Easter half term, while the second half started using the desks after Easter for another seven weeks.

During the experiment, pupils are being monitored in two ways.

One is with an actigraph accelerator - a red box worn on the waist like a pedometer to monitor how much physical activity is carried out.

They are also examined with an actipal activity monitor - a small patch stuck to the thigh, which measures whether the pupils is standing or sitting.

Their weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference and fine motor skills are also being taken, and the results will be compared at the end of the study.

‘It doesn’t seem to
 be limited to certain lessons, as it seems to be working for everything
 - maths, English, even using a laptop.

‘And
 I’m glad that the excitement of the experiment has shown them that 
scientists aren’t boring or stuffy - science can be fun, like this.’

Dr Sally Barber, principal research fellow at medical researchers Born in Bradford, said: ‘The idea is two-fold. Firstly, we want to see whether we can change pupils’ behaviour.

‘We know if you can establish healthy lifestyles early in life, they can be continued into adulthood.

‘So a less sedentary lifestyle while 
you’re a child means less sedentary adults. There have also been studies
 which show that conditions like diabetes are affected by sitting for 
long periods of time.

‘Secondly,
 sitting for a long period of time has been shown to have a negative 
impact on children in terms of concentration and behaviour. We want to 
see if this study will change that. ‘

Born
 in Bradford is a social study looking at a number of babies born in the
 city after 2007, and is now working with Loughborough University on the
 standing learning project.

Dr Barber said that the idea came from a school in Australia, which has now secured funding to roll out the trial over a number of schools in the country - proving its ‘feasibility’.

She added: ‘The idea is used in a school 
in Australia, New Zealand and one in Texas, America - but as far as we 
know it’s not been done anywhere else in Europe.’

The desks, which can be raised and lowered with a handle, have been donated by a company called Ergotron.

Dr Barber, who is working with four others on the study, said the hoped to have results of this first study by mid-September.

Grove House Primary School was opened in 1969 and has around 420 children in its main school as well as 52 in the nursery. But its latest Ofsted inspection in November 2013 concluded that it was 'a school that requires improvement'.

The report said there was an 'inconsistent' quality of teaching, governors were 'not holding leaders to account' and white British pupils were 'not doing as well as similar pupils across the country'.
