A mother-of-two who fell desperately ill on Christmas Eve had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after being hit by pneumonia.

Tracy Ralph, of Hawkwell, Essex, is a keen runner who was training for a half marathon when she reported feeling short of breath of December 24.

She was found to be suffering from pneumonia and her condition rapidly deteriorated over the following days.

After being put into a medically-induced coma on Christmas Day, she has since battled multiple organ failure, meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain.

Tracey Ralph had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after suffering multiple organ failure and developing septicaemia after coming down with pneumonia shortly before Christmas

Tragically, the 34-year-old, who has two sons aged four and 19-months, had to have her fingers and legs amputated below the knee.

She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve, but is still in intensive care in St Thomas's hospital, London.

Tracy's sister-in-law, Amanda Ralph, said: 'Tracy doesn't have any underlying medical conditions so this came completely out of the blue.

'She was suffering from flu-like symptoms just before Christmas but we thought nothing of it as it is so common at that time of year.

'The first we knew anything was seriously wrong was when she couldn't breathe and she had to be rushed to Southend Hospital in an ambulance on Christmas Eve. She's now at St Thomas's, since they transferred her there in the early hours of Boxing Day.

'We have been living through it, it has almost been an out of body experience, there has been no good news at all.

'We were close to losing her before she got transferred to London, the doctors said she might not make it at one point.'

The mother-of-two's family, including husband Brad and sons Miller and Hudson, didn't realise just how ill she was before she was suddenly rushed to hospital on Christmas Eve

Tracy's husband Brad, 37, has been at her side throughout the ordeal, but he has kept their children, four-year-old Miller and 19-month-old Hudson, away until their mum is up to seeing them.

She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve and doctors at St Thomas Hospital are hopeful Tracy will be well enough to be transferred to Southend hospital next week, but she is still battling a potentially fatal blood clot.

Pneumonia is a swelling of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection. Early symptoms include a phlegmy cough, fever or difficulty breathing.

Mild cases can be treated with antibiotics but more serious cases, which can be exacerbated by underlying health problems, can lead to more serious complications.

If left untreated, oxygen levels in the heart and brain can fall, leading to confusion, coma and organ failure, which can  be fatal.

Pneumonia can also lead to septicaemia, which can in turn mean amputations are needed.  

Her devastated family have now set up a fundraising page to pay for her rehabilitation and the prosthetic legs and feet they fear she will eventually need. They have so far raised nearly £25,000.

Her sister-in-law added: 'It's really humbling, we were up to nearly £18,000 in less than 24 hours.

'It just proves that Tracy is such a beautiful, lovely and caring person that so many people want to help her out. 

'We have had people who didn't even know Tracy contributing and those saying they can't afford much but giving what they can.

'We know that when she comes out of hospital she is going to need a lot of help. 

'Every penny will help Tracy and we are so grateful to everyone who has donated, we are raising the money for her rehab and ultimately the best prosthetic feet we can buy.'

Tracy, who works for Clarins at Debenhams in Southend, had been training to run the Southend Half Marathon later this year and had been training with the Essex Ladies Running Club before becoming ill.

A fellow member has now taken her spot and will donate everything she raises to Tracy's cause.
