Green Party leader Natalie Bennett today threatened to bring about a ‘peaceful political revolution’ as she pledged to unite with the Scottish and Welsh nationalists to block government spending cuts.

Miss Bennett said the election could be ‘a turning point in history’ after it was revealed the party has held talks with the SNP and Plaid Cymru about forming a left-wing ‘progressive alliance’ in Parliament.

At the start of the party’s biggest ever conference yesterday, Miss Bennett pledged to introduce free social care for all over-65s and said the country ‘needs a range of new taxes’.

As she arrived for the speech in Liverpool, Miss Bennett had been ambushed by journalists and asked: ‘Have you got your brain in gear today?’

The party has experienced a so-called ‘Green surge’ with record support and a quadrupling of membership in a year, but Australian-born Miss Bennett has faced sniping from within her own party.

After an excruciating radio interview last month, which saw her lapse into long silences, have coughing fits and complain of a ‘huge cold’, she apologised to members for her performance.

This afternoon, Miss Bennett told members in ‘in just nine weeks’ time, you will have in your hands something miraculous … the possibility of a peaceful political revolution.

‘Your vote can change the face of Britain. It can end the failed austerity experiment, end the spiteful blaming of the poor, the sick, the vulnerable for the mistakes of the wealthy.

‘This election can be a turning point in history.’

Miss Bennett announced that free social care for over-65s would be a pledge in the party’s manifesto, due to be released at the end of the month, because she said it was vital in a ‘decent, humane’ society.

She did not explain how this would be funded, but said ‘those who have the most’ should contribute and said the party would introduce a new wealth tax, a financial transaction tax and higher income tax for those earning more than £100,000.

Caroline Lucas, the party’s former leader and only MP, said there had been talks with the SNP and Plaid Cymru about acting as a left-wing bloc of MPs at Westminster in the event of a Labour government.

‘With the rise of the SNP, and with our own Green surge, we have the chance to forge a new grouping in Parliament. A progressive alliance,’ she said.

She added that the parties were united in their ‘opposition to austerity and cuts to essential services’ and would work to block the Labour party ‘when they ape the Tories’.

Over 1,300 Green Party members are expected to attend the three-day conference this weekend. They will debate matters including a motion ‘to remove our policy to ban all cars’.

A poll conducted by ComRes for ITV News yesterday revealed that the party is most likely to be associated by the British public as ‘idealistic’ (41 per cent) and ‘amateurish’ (35 per cent).

But it also found voters are more likely to associate the Greens with the phrases ‘A party of the future’ (21 per cent) or ‘appealing’ (18 per cent) than they would associate with the Liberal Democrats (9 per cent and 11 per cent respectively).
