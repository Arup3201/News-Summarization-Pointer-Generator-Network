Rosemary Batty, the mother of 11-year-old boy Luke Batty who was beaten to death by his father in February, has dedicated her Victorian Australian of the Year Award to her tragic son.

Ms Batty said her son Luke would be proud and a little embarrassed by his mum receiving the Victorian Australian of the Year Award for Domestic Violence Campaigner.

'As an 11, 12-year-old boy, he would be embarrassed and say `mum it's not a good look' ... it's not X Factor or Australian Idol,' she said in a lighter moment after receiving the award.

Rosemary Batty, the mother of 11-year-old boy Luke Batty who was beaten to death by his father in February, has dedicated her Victorian Australian of the Year Award to her tragic son

While the young boy might have been uncomfortable seeing his mother on stage, she was a popular winner at a reception in Melbourne on Tuesday night, judging by the standing ovation and minute-long applause she received when her name was announced.

Speaking of her son, the bereaved mother became emotional.

'I am here because of Luke,' she said.

Ms Batty has put the fight against domestic violence on the national agenda since her ex-partner killed their son in broad daylight on a cricket pitch.

She also firmly voiced commitment to speak up for victims of domestic violence.

'It's important that we understand it's no longer a subject that should stay behind closed doors,' she said.

'My commitment is I will continue to push this message and I accept this award on behalf of victims of domestic violence and for those who have no voice.'

The British woman explained that one in every three women is affected by domestic violence.

Ms Batty has vigorously campaigned against domestic violence since her son was tragically killed by his deranged father, Greg Anderson, 54, with a cricket bat and knife, at Tyabb oval on February 12.

An ongoing inquest into the murder has recently revealed that four police officers missed the opportunity to detain Anderson two weeks before he murdered his son because they were unaware of warrants for his arrest, due to an incompetent police data system.

Police sent four officers to Anderson's address on January 27, just weeks before Luke's death, as they knew of his violent reputation.

According to Ms Batty's lawyer, the officers who conducted the relevant background check on Anderson 'found no record' of outstanding warrants.

They were serving an intervention order taken out by Anderson's housemate.

Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said in February that the IT system failure was just one piece of a complicated case and there was no way of knowing if Anderson would have been held in custody or immediately bailed if he had been arrested before the murder.

The inquest also heard that the Department of Human Services closed its child protection file on Luke four months before he was murdered.

In a harrowing testimony, Rosie Batty revealed she and her son were terrified of Greg Anderson, Luke's father.

We locked the doors... we had a baseball bat in one bedroom, we had a baseball bat in another bedroom,' Ms Batty said in court, the ABC reported.

'This is what I was living with. The police were telling me we can't be there in time if he wants to kill you... perhaps you should consider moving back to England.'

Ms Batty also feared Anderson may have been contemplating killing their child in a murder suicide but believed the 11-year-old would be safe in public places.

She said she started to believe Mr Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'

Ms Batty said she started believing Greg Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke Batty a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'.

But she believed he would be safe with his father so long as they were in public areas like the football or cricket oval.

'I didn't know if Greg was referring to his own suicide tendencies or if he would like to have a joint suicide,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court.

'That image of him harming him (Luke) couldn't happen in a public place.

'It couldn't happen at the Tyabb oval but it bloody did.' 

Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife.

An eight-year-old boy, who was at the oval at the time of the attack, saw Mr Anderson raise the bat over his right shoulder but did not see it connect with Luke.

He ran and told his father, who called paramedics.

When emergency services workers arrived they saw Mr Anderson kneeling by Luke.

At first they thought he was helping him, the inquest heard.

When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now'.

Luke's mother, Rosie Batty, said she wanted her son to have a normal relationship with his father.

'For me it's really important a child should know his father,' she told the inquest.

'Greg was really loving and keen to be involved in Luke's life.

'But I said to myself this is a journey, I'll keep doing things that feel right until they didn't feel right anymore.'

Ms Batty said she changed her mind in April 2013 when Luke revealed his father had shown him a knife while Anderson prayed in his car.

'I was so alarmed I knew I could no longer support his relationship with his father,' Ms Batty said.

Greg Anderson was '100 per cent bad' and always likely to kill his son, according to a police officer who says his efforts to have him locked up were undone by the courts

Ms Batty blocked Anderson from having any access to his son in April 2013.

Counsel assisting the inquest, Rachel Ellyard, said the order was changed again in July 2013 to allow Mr Anderson access to Luke at football and cricket matches on the weekend.

Ms Ellyard said Mr Anderson was technically in breach of that order by seeing Luke at cricket training on a weekday.

Ms Batty said when she saw Mr Anderson at the cricket oval on the night of Luke's death it occurred to her to call the police, but she decided not to.

She said she had previously had unpleasant situations trying to get the police involved at the cricket club and didn't want to embarrass Luke in front of his friends.

Anderson, 54, was shot  by police after he lunged at emergency service at the oval where he brutally bludgeoned his son.

He died in hospital from gunshot wounds and self-inflicted knife wounds.
