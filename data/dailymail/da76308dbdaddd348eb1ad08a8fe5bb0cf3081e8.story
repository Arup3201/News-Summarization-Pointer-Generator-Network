The main motorway link between Heathrow
 Airport and central London has been closed to all traffic after a crack was found in a 'sensitive area' of an elevated section.

The M4, part of the Olympic Route Network, will be vital for transporting visitors 
into the city for the Games later this month and it would be a major embarrassment for organisers if the restrictions cannot be lifted in time.

Predicted to be shut for five days, the full closure of the motorway began at 8pm last night in both directions between junctions 1 and 3.

Blocked: The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2

The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2.

The Highways Agency said yesterday 
workers 'found a further crack in a sensitive location which requires us
 to keep the viaduct closed until the repair is complete.'

It said it expects work to be completed in time for the Olympic Games later this month.

Hairline cracks were discovered in some of the steel beams in March and since then restrictions on vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes have been in place.

A signed diversion route is in place on adjacent dual carriageways, the A312 and the A4.

Problem: The road is shut from the Boston Manor Viaduct to Junction 3

Transport spokesman for the London Assembly Conservatives, Richard Tracey told radio station LBC 97.3 it could signal a repeat of problems seen at the end of last year on the Hammersmith Flyover.

He said: If they don't fix it before the end of July, then of course it would cause a degree of chaos. As Locog and TfL have been telling us, people will be arriving at Heathrow for the Games before then."

In January this year, Hammersmith Flyover in west London was closed due to major structural problems

The cracked and decaying facade on the M4 flyover structure was flagged by workers as unsafe and in dire need of repair

It only fully reopened to all traffic in May following five months of repairs.

The thoroughfare, on the A4 at Hammersmith, was closed on December 23 due to water damage that corroded and weakened cables that give the bridge its strength.

It partially reopened a few weeks later but lorries had not been able to use it.

TfL said engineers said more work will be carried out on the bridge after the 2012 Games.
