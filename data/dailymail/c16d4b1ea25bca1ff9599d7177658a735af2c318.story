The former head of the CIA has offered an unflinching defense of the horrific treatment of terror suspects outlined in a US Senate report - saying intelligence officers were carrying out 'nation's will' and had developed a 'social contract with the America people.'

Michael Hayden also blasted the Senate torture report, which detailed horrific abuse of detainees at the hands of CIA operatives, as a one-sided 'prosecutor screed' and said it was the result of a partisan investigation that began with a 'predetermined outcome.'

'Let me be very candid. We thought we were doing the nation's will. And in fact, having lived through the period and even looking back on it now. I think this was indeed about the nation's will,' Hayden, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under George W Bush from 2006 until 2009, said on MSNBC on Wednesday.

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden is vigorously defending the agency's torture of terror suspects and has said the dirty work was the will of the American people

'And what you've got here is a small group trying to say, "Oh it was never about us. It's them. They did it." Frankly, that really is hypocritical.'

When asked how he knew it was the desire of the American people top carry out torture he said: 'We've got a system. We get to elect a president, we get to elect a Congress. We have an attorney general.

'These activities, the President authorized them. The Congress was briefed, without objection, and we carried them out.

'How else are we supposed to know the nation's will? You want a plebiscite on convert activities?' 

He also hit back against claims from the Senate report that torture wasn't effective in extracting meaningful intelligence. 

He told Fox News: 'These interrogations … gave us kind of a Home Depot-like storage of information on Al Qaeda on which we relied. We are still relying on it today.'

In an interview with Politico he said that before his 2007 Congressional testimony, he demanded the truth about the efficacy of torture from his underlings at the CIA. 

He said he told his deputy director: ‘Don’t f*** with me. If this story isn’t airtight then I’m not saying it to Congress.’ 

'They came back and said our version of the story is correct. Because of this program (Abu) Zubaydah begat KSM, who begat others. We learned a great deal from the detainees.' 

Zubaydah, a Suadi national who was water boarded 83 times, ran a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and has been described as one of Osama bin Laden's top aides. KSM, or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was the principle architect of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. 

Hayden, who has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program,' also criticized Tuesday's Senate report.

'I don't know that the report that was released yesterday is that historically accurate. It reads like a prosecutorial screed rather than a historical document,' he told NBC's Today show.

He said on MSNBC: 'They opted for the 6 million document fish in order to pull out of things, perhaps out of context, in order to make what appears to be a predetermined point.' 

Hayden, a retired US Air Force general, has been accused to lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the enhanced interrogation program. He says he never lied

The 6,000 page Senate report was written entirely by Democratic staffers after nearly every Senate Republican refused to be involved in the investigation. Republicans issued a rebuttal to the report, calling it sloppy and partisan. 

Hayden still maintains that what CIA officers carried out was not torture - and that it was legal and approved by the White House, the Attorney General and select members of Congress who were briefed on the matter. 

Former Deputy Director of the CIA Mike Morrall told CBS News: 'One of the reasons I react so strongly, as does George Tenet, to people calling it torture, was that the Department of Justice told us at time, this is legal, this is not torture. So when people call it torture, I react strongly because it says my officers tortured people -- they did not torture anybody.'

Nearly all of the horrific behavior detailed in the Senate torture report happened before Hayden was CIA Director - though he served as head of the National Security Agency from 1999 until 2005 and then Deputy Director of National Intelligence from 2005 until his 2006 appointment as the head of the CIA. 

He also denies that he lied to Congress during his 2007 testimony and offered a counter-punch - saying that Senator Dianne Feinstein, who released the torture report - was briefed about all the details of the CIA torture program as early as 2006 - and that little of the information in the report is new. 

'I didn't lie and I didn't mislead Congress,' he said. 

'... I actually argued within the (Bush) Administration that we needed to tell all the members of the (Senate Intelligence) committee going forward.

'And we needed to devise a plan that was not just based on raw presidential authority, but had political support from the other political branch so that going forward this would no longer be George Bush's program, but would be America's program.' 

Finally, Hayden warned that the damning torture report could put America at risk for another major terrorist attack by cowing the CIA. 

'We're going to end up a Central Intelligence Agency that is timid. The very charge that was made against us - the very charge that was made against us before 9/11.'
