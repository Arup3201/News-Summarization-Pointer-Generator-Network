Guilty: Kirsty Cox wept as she was jailed for two years for fraud totalling £450,000

It seemed like an impossibly good deal.

But when word spread about new iPads being sold at cut-price rates, dozens of buyers paid up in advance.

Unfortunately, it was indeed too good to be true.

Customers ended up £1.1million out of pocket after being tricked into believing businesswoman Kirsty Cox, 37, could deliver thousands of discounted tablets before Christmas.

By the time the mother-of-two was arrested, a mob had gathered outside her house demanding the iPads they had paid for.

Feelings were running so high she was kept in custody for her own safety.

Yesterday, Cox wept as she was jailed for two years at Teesside Crown Court after admitting a £450,000 fraud.

Passing sentence, Judge George Moorhouse said her actions had caused misery, especially to ‘young children who were expecting presents which never arrived’.

Shaun Dodds, prosecuting, said Cox conned people into thinking she could provide iPads cheaply by claiming she had a number of legitimate sources. Buyers believed they would get £50 to £100 off the retail price.

Cox told some people that a contact in the Armed Forces could source duty-free tablets from Dubai and others that a company she knew was selling them off cheaply as they had been on the shelves for 90 days.

The 37-year-old told customers she could get her hands on cut-price iPads. After initially fulfilling orders, the word spread and Cox faced an influx of orders, which she failed to honour. By the time she was arrested in December 2012 crowds of angry customers had gathered outside her home

She took payment up front and was able
 to fulfil initial orders. As word spread, impressed customers made 
orders for friends, family and colleagues.

The court heard Cox spent 
£1.52million on full-price iPads at PC World, but had to sell them on at
 a loss.

As time went by, 
she was unable to fulfil many orders and pressure mounted. Individual 
victims lost between £400 and £232,000 in the scam between August and 
December 2012.

One 
unidentified victim feared losing his businesses and home in the 
fall-out, the court heard.

A woman cancelled her own wedding to try to 
pay back the people she had taken money from to give to Cox.

Cox admitted four counts of fraud at Teesside Crown Court. Judge Moorhouse said her offending had caused 'misery' to many people in the run up to Christmas, leaving them without the presents they believed they had purchased for loved ones

Paul
 Cleasby, defending, described her business model as ‘ludicrous and 
frankly bizarre’ and claimed she made no money from the venture.

‘There 
was no planning, there was no sophistication,’ he said. ‘It seems to 
have been a snowball effect which quickly turned to an avalanche.’

Cox, described as a ‘well-presented’ woman, used her ‘niceness’ to win people’s trust.

Her
 business partner Neil Hathaway, who ran a successful communications 
firm, said that she had also traded on his good name.

The court heard 
his company lost £40,000 as a result of the scam. ‘I am shocked by the 
extent of the deception and I am hurt,’ he said.

Cox,
 of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, told police she was unable to 
deliver 4,000 iPads ordered by customers, saying: ‘I have made some 
very, very, very bad business decisions.’

Mr Cleasby added: ‘There was no exit strategy. The business model was doomed from  the outset.’
