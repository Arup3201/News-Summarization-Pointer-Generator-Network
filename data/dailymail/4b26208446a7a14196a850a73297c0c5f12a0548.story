The 13 Army soldiers currently quarantined at an American base in Italy, after spending 30 days in Ebola-ravaged Liberia, are doing well and have not shown any sign of the deadly disease so far.

Major General Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Forces in Africa, is also in quarantine and spoke to reporters in a video conference on Tuesday about conditions in isolation at the American base in Vincenzo, Italy. 

Gen Williams said his troops have spent the first three days of their 21-day quarantine eating meals together, skyping with family and working out. He added that spirits are high, and that the soldiers are proud of their work in Liberia fighting the 'silent enemy' of Ebola.

'The morale is high and very comfortable with the contribution we made,' said Gen Williams.

Symptom free: Major General Darryl Williams spoke to reporters via video conference on Tuesday, just three days after he and a dozen solders were put in quarantine after returning from a month in Liberia 

Under supervision: The returning Army soldiers are being confined to a housing complex with barracks, a dining hall and a gym, but no outside access, and must not interact with other personnel at the site. Above, the base in Vicenza

Gen Williams went on to explain that isolation means no contact with the outside world. At meal times, a team comes in to drop off food and they exit the dining area before the soldiers being monitored enter to eat.

After the meal, eating utensils, including plastic cutlery, are burned. Their temperatures are taken twice a day.

'The team provided us the ability to have exercise equipment, so the folks are eating well, they are exercising...I have the ability to get on computers and interface with my family,' Gen Williams said. 'I am a grandfather, I talk to my daughter and granddaughter on Skype.'

Flown over: The soldiers must also undergo twice-daily temperature checks for the deadly virus. Above, 100 U.S. Marines arrive at Roberts International Airport in Liberia on Thursday to join the fight against Ebola

Deadly virus: Ebola has already claimed the lives of at least 4,922 people, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Above, a health worker carries a two-month-old baby to an Ebola holding center in Monrovia, Liberia

The more than a dozen returning Army soldiers are the first wave of an expected 3,000 U.S. troops to be deployed to the Ebola hot zone countries in the coming weeks. Another 75 are expected to enter quarantine later this week.

The Army is so far the only U.S. service to require a mandatory three-week isolation for soldiers fighting the Ebola outbreak in Africa - even though none of the soldiers had contact with sick patients.

These first soldiers spent their month in Liberia building treatment units and training local health care workers.

But, the quarantine policy was put in place to reassure both military families and the Italian government that the Army was taking the Ebola threat seriously.

A military-wide solution to the troops being sent to Africa is expected to be decided later this week, by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.
