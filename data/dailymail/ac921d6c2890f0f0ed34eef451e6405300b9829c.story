A woman who fled an attempted rape on a Canadian rural road was lost for 12 days when she ran deep into the wilderness and could not find her way back, it was revealed Tuesday.

The 25-year-old woman - a member of the O'Chiese Indiana band - survived by eating berries and river water while she wandered the backcountry with a broken jaw and concussion she suffered in the assault, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.

Authorities have arrested Kevin Roy Gladue, 36, in connection with the attack and charged him with sexual assault, aggravated assault and obstructing a peace officer.

The woman is a member of the O'Chiese Indian band and was lost on the 54-square-mile reservation

The woman, who was barely conscious when she was found by an oil rig worker, managed to tell police that she was with Gladue and several friends on the north end of the O’Chiese Indian band in rural Alberta, Canada on July 14, according to the Canadian Press. 

When the truck broke down in the middle of the wilderness, she and Gladue got out and began to walk to get help.

She says Gladue then struck her in the face and tried to sexually assault her.

She fought him off and then rant into the wilderness of the vast 54 square mile O'Chiese reservation.

'She fled into the bush and, when she was in there, she got lost and disoriented and couldn’t find her way out again,' RCMP Corporal Nick Munro said.

For 12 days she wandered through the woods, trying to find her way back to civilization.

Middle of nowhere: The O'Chiese reservation where the woman was lost is 140miles from Edmonton in Alberta, Canada

Four days after she went missing, her mother called authorities. The RCMP and members of the O'Chiese nation mounted a massive search but could find no evidence of where she went on the vast reservation.

Authorities did not know about the attack at the time. They interviewed Gladue, who said he had no idea where she was. The RCMP never suspected him of foul play at the time.

To survive, the woman drank fresh river water and foraged for berries. 

She was discovered Friday when she stumbled on an oil rig worker who happened to be near the reservation. She was about six miles from the spot where she fled from the road.

She was barely conscious at the time. She had a broken jaw and numerous infected cuts on her body.

'She was suffering from exposure, may have been mildly concussed from the altercation - not in great shape,' the RCMP spokesman said.
