Meanwhile, unofficial reports that up to 100 delegates headed for an international AIDS conference in Melbourne were aboard downed flight MH17 are incorrect - with six confirmed at this stage.

Ms Barre-Sinoussi said there 'might be a few more' than the six confirmed delegates who were passengers on the plane, but discounted the larger figure circulating in the international press.

Speaking outside the event at the Melbourne Convention Centre on Saturday, Barre-Sinoussi said she and conference organisers had made checks with Dutch, Australian and Malaysian officials to confirm the numbers of victims who had been en route to the conference.

'The numbers that we have confirmed through our contact with authorities in Australia, in Malaysia, and the Dutch authority as well, is six people,' she said.

Melbourne sisters Olga Hawryszko, Katrina Romanyk, Anna Robertson and Luba Slobodiuk denounced Vladimir Putin as 'having blood on his hands'.

The sisters described their horror on learning of the tragedy on Ukrainian soil, and their anger when Mr Putin had blamed Ukraine for the missile strike.

'It was absolutely shattering,' Ms Romanyk said.

'Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, but the truth is now coming out about Putin and how Russia has funded, backed, armed and encouraged the people responsible fo this.

'He has nowhere to hide any more,' she said. 'He is worse than Hitler or Stalin.'
