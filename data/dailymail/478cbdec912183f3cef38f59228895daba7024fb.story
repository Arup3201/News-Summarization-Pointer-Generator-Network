Argentina be warned: Tim Krul can score penalties as well as save them.

On a sub-zero December night in 2005 on Tyneside, the Holland goalkeeper first emerged as a shootout hero.

And Krul hadn’t just made the decisive stop, he’d also blasted home from the spot to send Newcastle Under 18s into the next round of the FA Youth Cup at the expense of Stoke City.

Eight-and-a-half years on and Krul is again the spot-kick hero, only this time on the biggest stage of all.

From Kingston Park to the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador, the 26-year-old saved twice to book Holland’s place in the World Cup semi-finals during Saturday’s victory over Costa Rica.

Krul had only been brought on by manager Louis van Gaal in the 120th minute but it was a ploy which worked and the Newcastle keeper made headlines around the world.

Next up is Argentina on Wednesday and, although he is likely to revert to the bench, should the tie go the distance then he will again be called upon.

And Krul would have no problem stepping up himself should the shootout enter sudden death.

On that bitterly cold night in the west of Newcastle he had been one of the first to raise his hand as a volunteer taker.

As it was, youth-team boss Glenn Roeder went for five outfield players, including Andy Carroll and James Troisi, who appeared for Australia in Brazil last month.

But with the score at 7-7 Krul kept his nerve from 12 yards before saving Jarred Stevens’ effort to book Newcastle a fourth-round place.

Against Brighton later in the competition Krul saved twice during another shootout victory but the young Magpies were eventually eliminated at the semi-final stage.

Roeder always said that bigger nights awaited his teenage keeper. That arrived in front of a global audience at the weekend.

But Argentina be warned: even bigger nights could yet be to come.
