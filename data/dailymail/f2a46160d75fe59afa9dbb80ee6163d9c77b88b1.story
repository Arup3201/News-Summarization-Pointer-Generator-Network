Murray Walker, the unparalleled voice of Formula One, is expected to be absent from Sunday’s race.

Walker, 91 later this year, told The Mail On Sunday: ‘This is going to sound big headed - and I don’t mean it to - but if I go the British Grand Prix I don’t get any peace at all.

'It’s very touching but I am there as an enthusiast. It is also gigantically tiring and I don’t have the stamina I once had.’

Enthusiast: Murray Walker, pictured in 2007, admits he doesn't get any piece when he attends Silverstone

Silverstone, celebrating its 50th British Grand Prix this weekend, sold 124,000 tickets for Sunday’s race.

The circuit’s bosses may be disappointed not to have attracted a sell-out crowd - there are still 3,000 seats to fill.

Sergio 
Perez issued an apology following his ill-advised comments about Susie 
Wolff.

The Mexican was asked whether he'd like a female team-mate ahead 
of this weekend' s race, to which he replied: 'No, they are better off 
in the kitchen.'

But Perez moved to rectify his comments saying: 'I feel
 really ashamed by the way my words have been distorted. I want to be 
absolutely clear that my intention was not to offend anyone.'

Wolff, who
 became the first female racer in 22 years after she took to the wheel 
of the Williams in Friday's practice session, didn't appear offended by 
Perez's remarks.

'Saw some comments made by Sergio Perez as I was making
 dinner in the kitchen last night,'

Wolff, who lasted just four laps on 
her full F1 debut after suffering an oil-pressure problem, said. 'Please
 give him a break. His comments were taken completely out of context. 
Anyway, as my family will tell you, I drive better than I cook.'

Disappointing debut: Williams' Susie Wolff was was forced to retire from first practice after an engine failure

Williams have launched a Martini-branded motorhome in the Silverstone paddock.

The building, which stretches over three floors, has walls adorned with largely amusing black andwhite photos of Sir Frank Williams, the team’s founder, his daughter, Claire, who is also the team’s deputy principal, and drivers Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas.

Construction began on the motorhome in March and is incomparable to their former one-floored home.

‘We’re loving it; it looks amazing at night as well because of all the lovely lights,’ said Claire Williams.

‘There will be a few Martinis drunk,’ she added with a smile.

The Williams motorhome is among 600 tons
 of equipment - enough to fill 100 freight trucks - transported for 
teams, broadcasters and hospitality at every race. 

DHL, F1's official 
logistics partner, delivrt the entire cargo to the next race, or back at
 the team's headquarters, dependant on their preference, within 48 hours
 of the chequered flag falling.

Impressive, indeed.

George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, spent Saturday's qualifying session with McLaren boss Ron Dennis.

Osborne, who also sported a team jacket, proved to be somewhat of a good luck omen for the British constructor with Jenson Button claiming his best qualifying result of the season.

He will start from third as he bids to battle his torrid run of bad luck at Silverstone. Incredibly, in 14 previous attempts, the Briton has never stood on the podium at his home race.

Over in Red Bull's garage, Hollywood actor Michael Fassbender hid behind a pair of dark sunglasses despite the overcast conditions in Northamptonshire.

Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan was the star on show at Williams, while number cruncher Carol Voderman made her customary British Grand Prix appearance courtesy of Mercedes.

Remaining in the paddock, Bernie Ecclestone's impressive new statue outside his motorhome has been course of much discussion this weekend.

The muscular statue complete with a silver helmet and what appears to be a silver exhaust trailing from its back - you need to see it to believe it - is not thought to modelled on the diminutive 83-year-old ringmaster.
