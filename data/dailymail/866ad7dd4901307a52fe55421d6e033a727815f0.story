A woman who spent most her adult life as a size 30 shed the pounds in a phenomenal transformation - but lost her husband in the process.

Welsh-born Cheryl Blakelock, 54, who lives in Barnsley, slimmed to a size 10 but found out her husband of 25 years had started seeing her pre-weight loss doppelganger.

Cheryl was shocked to discover husband's lover was a size 24 - and even dressed like her before she lost all the weight.

Cheryl says when she was big she was 'easily controlled' and her husband didn't like the changes in her personality - the fact she became more confident - when she lost weight

'Once I found out about the affair 
that was it,' explains Cheryl.

'I found out about the affair on the Friday morning, by Friday afternoon, the house was up for sale and I'd booked an 
appointment with the solicitor.'

In a revealing new series dubbed I Lost Weight But I Lost My Husband!, Channel 5 follow a group of women whose weight-loss has changed them, their relationships and their lives.

In the first episode, airing tomorrow, Cheryl, who works at O2, explains that when she was overweight she lost her sense of her identity.

'While I was overweight I was easily controlled,' she says.

'I didn't really want friends. I didn't really have friends. I lived my life through my children. I didn't want to stand out, I wanted to blend into the shadows.'

When Cheryl was a size 30 she hid behind frumpy clothes and shied away from society. But when she shed the pounds, she finally stepped out into the light.

'It's like being an onion,' she says.

'As the weight comes on it sort of covers your personality, it encloses you. Then, as the weight comes off, it exposes who you really are.

'When I became slim it was like the weight came off my brain as well.'

When Cheryl decided to lose weight and dropped 10 dress sizes, she began to take control of her life. She felt like a new woman - 
one who gained confidence and would answer back - but she believes her 
husband found the change hard to deal with.

'He slowly lost control and that's when he started looking for another woman,' says Cheryl.

'A text came on his phone and I read it, and I even remember the words to this day.'

The intimate nature of the text convinced Cheryl her husband was having an affair.

That was enough of a shock, but Cheryl was even more surprised when she saw the woman her husband was having an affair with.

She'd spent 22 years being overweight and couldn't go back to being that woman again

'I didn't know much about her apart from that she was younger than me' she says.

'But
then when I saw the size of her... she was a size 24. At the time when 
we actually split, I was a size 10. She even dressed the same as I used 
to dress.'

Cheryl shares how when she was overweight she lost her sense of her identity but later found herself

It
was when Cheryl was a petite size 10 that she discovered her husband 
was having an affair with another woman more than twice her new dress 
size. She felt she was being replaced by a pre-weight loss version of herself.

But, as Cheryl says: 'I'd spent about 22 years being 
overweight and as a size 30 - I couldn't be that woman again.'

Cheryl, whose children were leaving home at this point, felt she was losing everything: her husband and her family.

'I thought - I have to get a life.'

Cheryl is now very active with DIY and gardening - and has slimmed down even further to a size 6

Cheryl explains when she was overweight she lost her sense of identity - but found herself when she slimmed down

'Anybody
who says to me they are the same person fat and thin - I'm sorry I 
would call them a liar. Losing weight changes you and changes your effect on people,' she says.

'Don't think your life's going to be the same because it's not.'
