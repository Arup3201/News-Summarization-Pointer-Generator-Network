Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has defended the Magpies' decision to prioritise the Premier League over domestic cups - by claiming other clubs do the same but 'don't say it'.

The Tyneside club have made no secret of their desire to put the money available from a good Premier League position ahead of potential cup glory.

Birmingham and Wigan, meanwhile, have both tasted domestic cup success in the same season as they were relegated in recent seasons and the Newcastle boss believes most Premier League clubs harbour the same policy as the Magpies but choose not to make it public.

Number one: Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has defended his club's decision to target a good Premier League finish over domestic cups, claiming other clubs do the same but choose to remain silent

Gone: Mike Williamson was sent off for Newcastle United in their 0-0 draw with Aston Villa on Saturday 

Early exit: Newcastle lost at home to Cardiff City in the FA Cup  last season to continue their shocking cup form

Pardew, quoted in The Chronicle, said: 'Perhaps, at board level, we say what other boards don't say in that the Premier League is the be all and end all because of the TV money, you cannot hide from that.

'We're not hiding from it, we've actually said it, perhaps to our detriment but we have said it. That is our priority.'

Despite admitting the Premier League is king to Newcastle, Pardew is adamant that he is targeting winning a trophy with the club.

The Magpies travel to Gillingham for their Capital One Cup second round tie on Tuesday having failed to score a goal so far this season following a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on Saturday. 

Pardew continued: 'Of course we want to win a cup and our fans want to win a cup.

'(The loss to Cardiff in the FA Cup in January was) our last cup game so we need to react to that and we need to get a win, so I'll probably take the same 20 players that I took to Aston Villa to Gillingham.'

Glory and despair: Wigan won the FA Cup in 2013 but were also relegated from the Premier League

Justification: Pardew believes Birmingham, who won the league cup but were relegated, paid for their cup runs

Poor start: Newcastle United have not scored a goal so far in the Premier League this season 

Determined: Pardew claims Newcastle want to win a cup despite prioritising the Premier League over trophies
