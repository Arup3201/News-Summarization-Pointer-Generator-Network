Britain is facing a growing £12billion bill to fix the nation’s potholes - made worse by the record rainfall and flooding this winter, a report reveals today.

It says the ‘catch-up’ cost of getting local roads back to a reasonable state has now soared by £1.5billion in a single year because of the deluge.

And that is despite extra cash and effort to fill more than two million potholes across England and Wales over the last 12 months.

Britain is facing a growing £12billion bill to fix the nation's potholes - made worse by the record rainfall and flooding this winter, a report reveals today

Compensation claims for car damage and injury caused by potholed or badly maintained roads now cost taxpayers £32 million a year and have soared by nearly 20 per cent in England and by 66 per cent in Wales.

It would now take 12 years to clear the road repair backlog in England and Wales and 14 years in London, says the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey carried out by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA).

Motoring groups said it was time to end the ‘sticking plaster’ and ‘patch and mend’ approach.

Councils in England said the cost of restoring roads to a reasonable condition had risen 30per cent since last year to an average of £90million per authority.

In his Budget last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced an extra £200million to repair potholes in 2014-15 . And Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced £183.5million emergency funding to help with road repairs following ‘the wettest winter on record’.

He said the cash would pay for the repair of 3.3million potholes.

But motoring groups said this was ‘a sticking plaster not a cure’.

The AIA said the record winter rainfall had undone much of the pothole work done over the last 12 months with up to two thirds (65per cent) of local authorities in England affected by the winter deluge.

Compensation claims for personal injury or damage to vehicles has increased by nearly 20 per cent over the last year to an average of 540 per local authority in England - up from 452 last year. This excludes London where the figures remain the same at 126 per authority. But in Wales claims have shot up by 66 per cent to 141 per council - up from 80 last year.

The total cost of compensation claims 
caused by poor road condition across England and Wales over the last 
year topped £31.6million, of which £16.6million was for claim pay-outs 
to motorists and other road users with the remaining £15million - up 
from £13million the previous year - caused by the rising council 
staff-costs of processing the claims.

AIA
 chairman Alan Mackenzie said the figures were ‘disappointing’ for 
everyone who has worked to improve the roads: ‘To see that work washed 
away is discouraging to say the least.’

RAC technical director David Bizley said it was ‘no great surprise’ that the catch up cost of getting roads in order had risen.

And
 AA president Edmund King said voters should take note: ‘It is 
unacceptable that each winter, whether it is frost or rain, our roads 
are crumbling and give way too easily. Bad surfaces with millions of 
potholes can cause death and injury especially to those on two wheels 
and lead to expensive damage and insurance claims.’

The Local Government Association said the country was facing a 'roads crisis escalating at an alarming pace'.

Peter Box, chairman of the LGA’s economy and transport board, said: 'Councils have long warned that our already dilapidated road network could not cope with another extreme winter and the unprecedented recent flooding experienced across the country has left behind a trail of destruction to our highways.'

The Government’s promised extra funding was welcome 'but it is simply not enough to free councils trapped in an endless cycle of only being able to patch up our deteriorating network. This will always be more expensive than longer-term preventative work,' he added.

‘This country is now facing a roads crisis escalating at an alarming pace with every bout of severe weather and following years of underfunding.’

He noted: ‘Our roads are now in such disrepair that it will take more than a decade and £12billion to bring them up to scratch.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said it had increased funding by more than 27 per cent this parliament 'to help councils tackle potholes', adding: 'We are providing councils in England with more than £10billion from 2010 to 2021 for local highway maintenance'.

This includes an extra £183.5million 'specifically to help areas damaged by bad weather this winter.'

The spokesman said: ''This long-term funding will help councils maintain their roads effectively. It is now important for local government to understand how any suggested backlog has increased and what measures councils can take to address it.'
