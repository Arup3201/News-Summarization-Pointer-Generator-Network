They have been trapped in the depths of eastern Antarctica since Christmas morning as every rescue mission so far has failed.

But pictures sent from Russia's Academic Shokalskiy show the 74 people on board are not letting the setback get them down.

Captured throwing snowballs, playing with penguins and gliding around the five-metre-deep ice sheets, the passengers and researchers claim they are more than content with being marooned in the coldest part of the world.

The crew called for help at 5am on Christmas Day after their vessel became surrounded by ice sheets.

The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart

A top-of-the-range Chinese icebreaker,
 the Snow Dragon ('Xue Long'), was deployed but it too got stuck at just
 six nautical miles from the ship.

Yesterday, Australia's back-up ship Aurora Australis took charge of the rescue mission, with hopes to arrive this evening.

However,
 the rescue team have warned they may need another fall-back as the 
vessel, which can crack up to 1.35 metres of ice, may not be strong 
enough to break through.

The
 captain of the Aurora, Murray Doyle, said his ship was always 'option B'.

The Snow Dragon, which will remain on 
standby, has a helicopter on board that can be used to rescue passengers
 if the Aurora Australis can not break through the ice, said Australian 
Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Lisa Martin.

'The Aurora Australis is expected to arrive at the scene Sunday evening. It's pretty slow going out there,' Ms Martin said.

The third icebreaker, a French-flagged ship, is no longer involved in the rescue.

Crew members routinely check the hull of the ship, which gathers fresh layers of snow every night

The Academic Shokalskiy set off from New Zealand on November 28 to recreate a 100-year-old Australasia expedition
 first sailed by Sir Douglas Mawson to see how the journey changes using
 new technology and equipment.

But on Wednesday morning, the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still.

Chris Turney, an Australian professor who helped organise the voyage on the Russian ship, yesterday posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice.

'Everyone well,' Turney added.

He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'.

Just before 5am on Wednesday, Australia deployed a The Snow Dragon to free the group into open water.

French
 vessel L'Astrolabe was sent out for back up, alongside 
Australia's Aurora Australis, which is carrying food and first aid 
professionals.

After two days being stranded, passengers hoped to be rescued by the Snow Dragon as it powered through horrific conditions.

Blizzards could hamper the rescue mission, but the ship is well-stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them

But on Friday the heavy winds became too great, and built up an impenetrable pile of snow.

Academic Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in 1982, was originally used for 
oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a 
passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica.

Marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of
 Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania - the thick 
ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind.

The Russian embassy in Australia has 
been in constant contact with the captain and said everyone on board was
 in good health and there was 'no threat to their lives or safety'.

On
 board are scientists from the University of New
 South Wales, a journalist from The Guardian and dozens of tourists who 
have paid to be part of the recreation of Mawson’s expedition.

The research team has made contact with local stations from the Commonwealth Bay to say they are well-stocked with food.

The ship had been on a multi-day tour from New Zealand to visit several sites along the edge of Antarctica before getting trapped in sea ice

'We
 all know that there's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted
 sit and wait,' said Andrew Peacock, a passenger onboard the Akademik 
Shokalskiy, speaking via satellite phone.

'I think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives.

'We really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need.'

However, he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight.

They are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets.

A
 spokesman for Australia's Maritime Safety Authority told Australia's 
Associated Press: 'It is quite a remote part of the world, but we have 
everyone safe. The vessel isn't in any immediate danger.'

The spokesman said the ship was visiting a number of sites along the edge of Antarctica.

One has managed to send a tweet.

Chris
 Turney, of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, wrote: 'Heavy ice. 
Beautiful; light wind. Only -1degC. All well. Merry Xmas everyone from 
AAE.'
