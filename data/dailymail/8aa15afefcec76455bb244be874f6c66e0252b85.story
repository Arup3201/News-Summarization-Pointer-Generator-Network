A U.S. judge has dismissed a federal lawsuit by Angelina Jolie's stunt double against News Corp for allegedly hacking into her voicemail.

Eunice Huthart was the first alleged victim to launch legal action against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. over the allegations.

The British 47-year-old, who won TV game show Gladiators, claimed The Sun and The News of the World intercepted her phone messages in an attempt to gather gossip about the Hollywood actress.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing it should have been filed in the UK where more than 600 hacking claims were being processed under a compensation scheme.

Judge Michael W Fitzgerald, of the United States District Court Central District of California, has now ruled in favour of News Corp's motion to dismiss, radaronline.com has reported.

The ruling said: 'The underlying facts here do not seem to be in dispute, at least by these parties.

'It appears, and certainly is alleged, that Plaintiff Eunice Huthart has suffered a grotesque invasion of her privacy.

'This harm arose for no reasons other than Huthart’s successfully pursuing a demanding career associated with Los Angeles and having a friend who likewise is at the summit of success in an industry associated with Los Angeles.

'Nonetheless, for reasons explained in this Order, the Court concludes that Huthart must obtain her relief from the courts of England and Wales.'

Working together: Ms Huthart and Ms Jolie together on the set of 2010 spy thriller Salt

News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World.

The stuntwoman claims that News 
International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover 
Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of 
2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith.

Her
 claims date back to 2004 and 2005 when she was apparently living with 
Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and 
socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets.

Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith.

Around
 the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, 
which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the
 title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance 
between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt.

The claim was the first hacking case Rupert Murdoch's media empire faced in the U.S.

The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an "item"'.

The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress.

Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'.

News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun.

The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler.

The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than £200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking.

A number of former News International executives are currently on trial for hacking-related offences.
