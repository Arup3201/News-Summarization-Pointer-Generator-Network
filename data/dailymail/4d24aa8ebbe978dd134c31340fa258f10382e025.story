The one who knocks: Breaking Bad, starring Bryan Cranston, might win at the Baftas despite most UK viewers not having seen it

Next year’s TV Baftas could be won by shows that have never been screened in the UK following a change in the rules.

The country’s top television awards will allow foreign shows that are only available online to compete for the first time.

It means hit American series Breaking Bad – which is currently only available in this country on DVD and through Netflix – could win a prize next year, even though it has not been seen by the vast majority of British viewers.

Other series that could benefit from the rule change include Kevin Spacey’s political drama House Of Cards, which was shown exclusively on Netflix.

Earlier this year, the Best International Series category was won by US drama Girls, which was screened here on Sky Atlantic.

Entries for next year’s Baftas opened yesterday.

Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said: ‘We continually strive to ensure our Awards remain relevant to the industry, as well as reflecting the trends among the viewing public.

‘We’re in a golden era for storytelling and programme-making, with top-class shows being broadcast online as well as on digital and terrestrial television. The latest update to our rules ensures we celebrate and reward the very best.’

Last month the Emmys, the main TV awards in America also allowed online shows to be contenders for an award for the first time.

House of Cards, featuring Kevin Spacey, is also eligible, even though it was a Netflix exclusive
