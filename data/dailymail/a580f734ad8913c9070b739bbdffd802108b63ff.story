A performer wow the crowd in Beijing with a less-than-appetizing snake act, putting the heads of live reptiles in his mouth during a festival for the Chinese new year.

Celebrations continued across China and the globe today with thousands of Lunar Festivals to commemorate the year of the snake.

The fair at the Ditan Temple in Beijing featured the troupe which performed with different types of snakes on stage.

The Lunar New Year, also known as the 
Spring Festival, began on Sunday, marking the start of the Chinese zodiac's year of the snake. 

The Lunar New Year remains the most 
important festival for Chinese people, resembling a Western Christmas with a weeklong 
celebration of family reunions, gifts and gastronomic 
excess.

The snake zodiac is said to bring 
financial success and a blossoming social life although it has been 
known to hold bad tidings and is not as loved as the powerful
 dragon of 2012.

‘In Chinese mythology, snakes were 
often associated with monsters, or with incarnations of monsters, so 
some political turbulence can be expected,’ said Taiwanese astrologer 
Tsai Shang-chi.

In China, some couples have apparently
 been trying to schedule their pregnancies to avoid having children born
 during the snake year, in contrast to the coveted ‘Year of the Dragon’.

However Tsai is largely upbeat on the 
new Chinese year. He believes much-needed liquidity will be injected 
into struggling world economies, and that babies born over the next 12 
months will be both self-motivated and agile.

For souvenir makers, snakes have been a tough sell.

‘Last year, our business was a lot 
better, because everybody loves the dragon, whatever his or her animal 
sign,’ said Lin Peixiang, who owns the Beixiang Souvenir Factory in the 
city of Wenzhou.

‘This year, business is a lot worse, 
because only those born in the year of the snake love the animal.

'The 
snake sign is a symbol of fear. People get scared when they see or hear 
the snake.’

Pleasant pals: 2013 is the year of the water snake meaning luck in finances and social lives

Hong Kong feng shui master Raymond Lo 
is trying to put a positive spin on the year. He points out that 
according to astrological tables, this year's variety is the relatively 
mild ‘morning dew’ type of common water snake, less venomous than recent
 predecessors.

‘It's more moderate, humble and 
patient,’ Lo said of the 2013 snake.

‘Unlike dragons that make abrupt, 
attention-getting moves, snakes take slow and steady steps.'
