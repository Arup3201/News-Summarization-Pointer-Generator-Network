With his chiselled features, piercing blue eyes and a surname that opened just about any door in America, Robert Kennedy Jnr must have been all but irresistible to the women he tried to seduce.

The fact he was married with children seems to have given neither him nor his many lovers pause for thought.

Yet when he had bedded yet another woman, he would go home and write in a diary that the liaison constituted yet another ‘mugging’ — of him, not his companion. He also wrote that if he went a day without adultery it was a ‘victory’.

A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child

Unfortunately, there were far too few days when his ‘lust demons’, as he called them, did not win their battle.

In
 the extraordinary diary discovered by his wife shortly before she 
committed suicide in grief over the break-up of their marriage, the son 
of Bobby Kennedy — and the nephew of JFK — recorded serial philandering 
which puts even the priapic ways of his presidential uncle in the shade.

When
 challenged by a journalist who had been handed the bombshell diary, 
Kennedy, a 59-year-old former heroin addict, initially insisted it did 
not exist, but yesterday belatedly admitted it was indeed his.

Across
 398 pages, in puerile detail, the thick, red journal records his every 
conquest during the year 2001 — and in the process becomes the latest 
shameful chapter in the history of America’s most venerated yet most 
dysfunctional family.

Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside in 2012 with their children, wrote in his 2001 diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her

Part 
self-flagellating Catholic mea culpa, and part smutty schoolboy 
boasting, the diary includes a scorecard in which he recorded the names 
of all the women he slept with, alongside a number between one and ten 
denoting how far he went with each.

The
 numbers corresponded to sexual acts, with ten denoting intercourse. At 
the back of the diary, in the section marked ‘cash accounts’, Kennedy 
noted the names of all 37 women with whom he cheated on his wife that 
year — 16 of whom got tens. They reportedly include a lawyer, a doctor, 
an environmental activist and the wife of a famous actor.

The shocking details were revealed by the New York Post, which has seen the diary.The
 timing of his adultery was particularly awful. Not only did Mary give 
birth to their fourth child in July of that year, but many of his 
adulterous liaisons came at a time when the rest of America was deeply 
traumatised by the September 11 attacks.

It
 seems even that horror was not enough to quash his addiction to sex, 
which led Kennedy — on November 13, 2001, his diary reveals — to seduce 
three women in a single day, although only one was a ‘ten’.

On
 the same day, he mustered enough energy to squeeze in a charity 
fundraising dinner at a Manhattan hotel, where he sat next to the 
paralysed Superman star Christopher Reeve.

That
 month alone, as Kennedy travelled around the  U.S. for his work as an 
environmental campaigner, he listed one woman’s name on 22 different 
days.

In May, he hosted a 
dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio in New York, but ‘got mugged on my way 
home’ — noting the woman’s name, and the fact she inflicted a ten on 
him. ‘I’ve got to do better,’ he added, as though confessing to a 
priest.

Sometimes he 
managed to resist. ‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team 
[two women],’ he related in a February diary entry. ‘It was tempting, 
but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no.’

Serial
 adultery is a weakness among the testosterone-fuelled male Kennedys. 
Patriarch Joe Kennedy showed the way with his open affair with actress 
Gloria Swanson, reportedly telling his sons — John, Bobby and Ted — to 
get ‘laid as often as possible’. They dutifully obliged.

It seems the infidelity gene has been inherited in a third generation.

Even
 to his diary, Robert Jnr couldn’t be completely honest. Despite Bobby 
Kennedy’s own track record, his son comically insists he was ashamed by 
what his father might think of his own philandering. And he makes clear 
in the book that he is one of many younger Kennedys who have had trouble
 living up to the family’s gilded ‘Camelot’ reputation.

After his father was assassinated in 1968, Robert Jnr ‘struggled to be a grown up’, he told his diary.He
 went on: ‘I felt he was watching me from Heaven. Every time I was 
afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I 
began to lie, to make up a character who was the hero I wished I was.’ Since when was having ‘sexual thoughts’ a sign of failure in the thrusting Kennedy family?

Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility.

But
 the Irish-American clan has always been able to hide its transgressions
 behind its supposedly staunch Catholicism, and Robert Jnr himself used 
Biblical imagery to describe his own womanising.

‘Despite
 the desperate things happening in the world, my life is . . . great,’ 
he wrote on November 5, 2001. ‘So I’ve been looking for ways to screw it
 up. I’m like Adam and Eve, and I can have everything but the fruit. But
 the fruit is all I want.’

On
 another occasion, he told himself to be ‘humble like a monk. Keep your 
hands to yourself. Avert your eyes’. He should avoid women, he added, as
 he didn’t have the strength to ‘resist their charms’.When he spent a
 month in a Puerto Rican jail over his involvement in a protest against 
U.S. bombing exercises on a local island, he told his diary: ‘There’s no
 women. I’m happy!’

On the 
eve of being released, he claimed he had a ‘three-point plan’ to fix his
 ‘greatest defect . . . my lust demons’. Such high hopes appeared to 
last little more than two weeks before he was again recording the names 
of women he had seduced.

The
 infidelity in the 2001 diary alone would be enough for any philanderer,
 but inevitably it was only one chapter in Kennedy’s  bed-hopping 
lifestyle.

H  is serial adultery was cited ten years later in the breakdown of his marriage to Mary, whom he had known since she was 14.

They
 also shared a history of alcoholism, which Robert Jnr compounded with a
 drug problem, being convicted of heroin possession in 1983. Mary was 
pregnant with their first child when they married in 1994, just a few 
weeks after he divorced first wife, Emily.

Kennedy
 — who has talked in the past about running for the U.S. Senate — 
clearly regards himself as a public figure. He has endorsed various 
Democrats in presidential campaigns and appeared in an ad campaign for 
Hillary Clinton. Yesterday, he faced further embarrassment as the New 
York Post published what he revealed in his diary about fellow public 
figures.

Robert Jnr, who 
has positioned himself as a lion of the Liberal-Left, described George 
W. Bush as ‘an idiot and a puppet’ a day after 9/11.

But
 he was equally damning of black allies on the Left. Civil rights 
activist and presidential contender Al Sharpton was a ‘buffoon’ whose 
‘venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership’. 
Fellow civil rights firebrand Jesse Jackson was, he wrote, a publicity 
addict who made him feel ‘dirty’.The Kennedy brand remains so strong
 that Robert Jnr will be forgiven his political posturing in time, but 
his sexual antics will be rather harder to sweep away.

His
 compulsive infidelity is particularly damning given that the Kennedys 
have been in a bitter dispute with his wife’s family over the 
circumstances of her death.

Mary
 was found hanged in a garage at her home in Westchester County, outside
 New York, in May last year. She had been struggling with depression, 
alcoholism and financial problems as she fought a vicious divorce and 
child custody battle with her estranged husband.

The
 year before her death, the Kennedy camp leaked a shocking court 
affidavit from Robert Jnr in which he asked for a protection order 
against his wife.

Kennedy
 claimed she had been violently abusing him since they married, and once
 — in a rage about his friendship with his ex-wife Emily — hit him in 
the face, her engagement ring crushing his tear duct and causing 
permanent damage.

But even 
he implied she was justified in telling their children he was a ‘sex 
addict’. By 2001 — the year covered by the diary — he was ‘committing 
numerous infidelities to keep my sanity’, he admitted in the affidavit.

After
 Mary’s death, Kennedy —who was dating the actress and Curb Your 
Enthusiasm TV star Cheryl Hines at the time — said his wife had phoned 
him the day before her death pleading for help.

‘She told me that she was sorry for everything . . . that everything was her fault,’ he told police.

But
 her family were so appalled by his behaviour towards her that they 
insisted on holding a separate memorial service, from which the Kennedys
 were excluded.

We now know
 at least partly what might have sent Mary Kennedy out of her mind — 
even, according to their housekeeper, once attacking her husband with a 
pair of scissors as he sat in the bath. Some women would say he was 
lucky she didn’t kill him, given the way he behaved.

The
 ‘curse of the Kennedys’ may have become a part of American folklore, 
but from the evidence of Robert Jnr’s self-pitying diary, no one 
believes in it more than the family does.
