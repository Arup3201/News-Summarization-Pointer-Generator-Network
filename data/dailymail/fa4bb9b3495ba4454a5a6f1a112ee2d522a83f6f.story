Lupita Nyong'o was the uncontested best-dressed - as well as Best Supporting Actress - at the Oscars last night. The 12 Years a Slave actress's baby blue Prada gown stood out in a sea of safe nudes and creams with a look that recalled Alice in Wonderland - right down to the sparkling band atop her head.

Jennifer Lawrence also won points for her choice of a strapless, tomato red peplum-waisted gown. As the face of Dior she has the pick of the collection, and she (or rather her stylist) chose well in a selection that not only holds its own in the style stakes, but does not overwhelm the person wearing it.

The majority of female attendees, though, wore shimmering columns of pale sequins, which, while pretty and elegant, left us feeling like we'd seen it all before. Instead, it was those who wore black who were among the most
 interesting looks of the night.

Lupita in Wonderland: The 12 Years a Slave actress looked showstopping in pale blue Prada and dazzling Alice band

Best dressed AND Best Supporting Actress: The Oscar-winner set herself apart from the crowd in an unexpected color and a sparkling headpiece

Lady in red: Jennifer Lawrence continues to earn
 her keep as the face of Dior, looking sensational in this 
tomato-colored, peplum-waisted gown

Julia Roberts in black lace Givenchy,
 Charlize Theron in Dior and Margot Robbie in Saint Laurent were among 
the highlights - Miss Robbie, especially, looked a far cry from her Wolf
 of Wall Street character with her new dark locks and sultry berry 
lipstick, but it was the back view that stole the show with that giant 
bow.

Olivia
 Wilde, too, looked sensational in a high-necked Valentino gown, made to
 accommodate her seven-months baby bump. The cut-out back and the panel 
of white gave it a Sixties mod look that is rare at the Oscars, and 
refreshing to see. And Anne Hathaway saved her Gucci gown from falling into dull territory the literal way with a sparkly breastplate.

Emma
 Watson, in slinky, smoky Vera Wang, shows us what the designer is like 
at her moodiest. It was edgy and elegant without being too angsty teen -
 a trap former child stars risk falling into. We loved tank-like top and
 her high-volume, mussed-updo.

Black is back: Wolf of Wall Street 
actress Margot Robbie proved that black doesn't have to mean boring in 
this bow-backed Saint Laurent gown

Red carpet moment: Charlize Theron looked every inch the movie star in plunging black Christian Dior

Of the pale sparkly numbers there were a few that stood out. Naomi Watts, as always, proved that she is one step ahead in the style stakes with a cap-sleeved Calvin Klein gown that was breathtakingly sleek and simple, set off by a statement Bulgari neckpiece, slicked-back hair and deep red lips.

Kate Hudson's cape-shouldered Versace 
was one of the host highly-rated looks too. The actress does a plunging 
neckline like few others, and the covered shoulders were at once strong 
and demure.

Representing for Team Elie Saab were Angelina Jolie and Sarah Paulson, while Cate Blanchett went for Armani Prive and Jessica Biel wore Chanel.

Amy
 Adams and Sandra Bullock both looked sensational as always, but their 
navy strapless gowns, by Gucci and Alexander McQueen respectively, 
made for remarkably similar silhouettes.

We loved the risk taken by Sports
 Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover girl Chrissy Teigen, who made a brave 
choice in Monique L'Huillier. It will no doubt divide opinion, but 
found favor with us. And Leslie Mann was a ray of sunshine in her yellow Jenny Packham gown at the Vanity Fair party.

Over at Elton John's viewing party, Kim Kardashian was the belle of the ball in Celia Kritharioti. Yes, it exposed a lot of cleavage, but the color was great on her and the ballgown silhouette is one we don't see her wear much.

While many of the other stars in attendance at the Oscars played it safe in sparkly white (or variations on the pale hue), they do deserve credit for looking flawless nonetheless.

Best Actress winner Cate Blanchett's Armani Prive ballgown was ravishing, and a little racy in that it gave the impression of being almost see-through. Jennifer Garner, too, looked ravishing in her Oscar de La Renta gown with its tiers of silver fringing.

Nor, indeed, could we expect anything 
close to boring from Lady Gaga, who wore a Versace gown that would 
probably have looked ludicrous on anyone else, but of course she pulled 
it off, complete with sweeping scarf by way of a train.

We loved Camila Alves for wearing an unexpected designer - Gabriela Cadena - and looking sensational in the tailored, blush pink creation, and Jenna Dewan Tatum's Reem Acra gown was pure romance.

There were some style highlights among the TV presenters too - while most of the attention was on the A-listers, those covering the red carpet arrivals brought their A-game too. Louise Roe looked stunning in emerald green Pronovias, as did Robin Roberts in Dennis Basso.

Something different: At the Vanity Fair party, we loved Leslie Mann's yellow Jenny Packham gown (left), while at Elton John's viewing party, Kim Kardashian was

Best of the presenters, from left: Robin Roberts in Dennis Basso, Maria Menounos in Johanna Johnson, Louise Roe in Pronovias and Kelly Osbourne in Badgley Mischka

Kelly Osbourne looked sleek in 
Badgley Mischka (though for some inexplicable reason changed out of it 
to actually present on E!) and Maria Menounos was as glamorous as ever 
in Johanna Johnson.

Of course where there are fashion hits there are also fails, and alas there were some stars who took their risks too far.
