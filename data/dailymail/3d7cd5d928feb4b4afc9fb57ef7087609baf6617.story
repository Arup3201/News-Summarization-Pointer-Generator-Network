Jailed: Gina Matthews, pictured outside court today, admitted to stealing £179,000 from her parents

A 42-year-old woman who stole more than £150,000 from her cancer-stricken mother's bank account has been jailed for 21 months. 

Gina Matthews, who works in a school, took money from her mother over a period of five years by fraudulently signing cheques and using her debit card to withdraw cash.

She also took money from her father, who suffers from MS, that was meant to be used to pay his care home fees.

Sentencing Matthews at Chelmsford Crown Court, Judge Christopher Ball said that it was a 'significant breach of trust' against 'vulnerable' family members who were 'very reliant on her'. 

He said: 'That theft, I have no doubt, went towards funding your own very comfortable lifestyle and towards the end of the five and a half years there appears to have been a disturbing cocaine habit which has arisen from somewhere.'

Prosecutor Barry Gilbert said Pauline Chalkley, who was receiving treatment for stomach cancer, opened a savings account with £192,000 in 2007.

Her daughter transferred the money to another account, still in Mrs Chalkey's name, that she withdrew money from without her mother's knowledge. 

Matthews admitted that she had falsely represented to Barclays Bank that 31 cheques drawn on Mrs Chalkley's account, for a total of £58,481, were signed by her mother. 

She also admitted that she had told the bank that she was authorised to use the debit card when she wasn't. Between October 2007 and April 2013 she withdrew £100,000 from the account. 

The court also heard that between October 2010 and August 2012, Matthews stole £27,000 from a Post Office account belonging to her father, John Chalkley. 

The money was intended to be used to pay the fees of the care home where her father lives. 

Mr Gilbert said: His fees were supposed to be paid by the defendant from that account and she had control over it. She had not been paying the care home. 

The home manager had sent letters about the outstanding bills to Mrs Chalkley but Matthews concealed those, as well as letters from the bank and even bailiffs, he added.

Matthews attempted to take her own life when her mother found out about the money in March last year, the court heard. 

All of the money in Mrs Chalkley's account had been taken by the time Matthews was arrested.

Mitigating, Lorhan Amirthananthar said Matthews helped her mother, who was diagnosed with four types of cancer in five years, and visited her father regularly.

She continued : 'At first, what started as sometimes borrowing money with a view to putting it back, it snowballed with one's hands in the goodie bag.'

The lawyer said the money was spent on 'quite mundane things' and living expenses.

Counsel added that Matthews had worked in a school for six years and had an exemplary record and continued : 'Sometimes good people do very bad things and she really does fall into that category. She's very sorry.'

Matthews pleaded guilty to taking a total of £179,000 on the day of her trial - at which her parents were due to give evidence.

The judge accepted that she had given 'valuable and loving care and support to her parents', but said that she had breached their trust. 

Matthews was jailed for 21 months and the judge imposed an indefinite restraining order - banning her from contacting her parents.

Barclays had repaid £180,000 to the Chalkleys because it accepted it 'should have been more vigilant' with its administration, the prosecutor said.
