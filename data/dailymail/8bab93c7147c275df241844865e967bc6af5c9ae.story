He's the TV doctor famous for putting his body through some of the worst fad diets the industry has to offer, as well as creating a healthy regime of his own: the 5:2 diet.

Now Michael Mosley has turned his attention to doctors of a different kind - the incredible men and women who put their lives on the line to rescue animals caught up in war and natural disasters.

Among them are the crack team who descended on the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan to come to the aid of some of the millions of creatures displaced by the disaster.

In this moving account, Dr Mosley reveals why their work is so important and explains why we shouldn't forget about the plight of animals - even in the midst of a human tragedy.

Important work: Juan Carlos Murillo, the main vet, shows Michael Mosley how to hold a piglet

'I am used to investigating the internal workings of the human body, but last year I found myself in the Philippines, where I spent my early childhood years.

Here I learnt how to bottle-feed a fully grown male water buffalo and helped build typhoon-proof houses for litters of charming little piglets, complete with removable roofs and warm, springy floors made of special bio-degradable compost. It was like being James Herriot on an eco-friendly gap year.

When Typhoon Haiyan hit this vast archipelago last year, winds of over 230 mph devastated the nation’s 7,000 islands, killing over 6,000 people in a few hours and leaving over four million more homeless.

But this human tragedy was only part of the story. As the farmers suffered, millions of domestic animals were killed in the storms or died later from injuries, starvation, exposure or disease.

Enter the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), an organisation dedicated to promoting animal welfare across the globe.

Tragedy: When Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines on 8th November 2013, it killed more than 6,000 people

Aid: The typhoon also killed six million animals but vets such as Cinthya Diaz are there for those who survived

Important: Water buffaloes such as this one are a hugely important part of Filipino life

They have teams ready to come to the aid of animals caught up in natural catastrophes at four days’ notice.

BBC Two asked me to join them. I’d done a series called Front Line Medicine about doctors treating British troops in Afghanistan. This was very different. 

I’d never been involved in veterinary work before, and that was part of the attraction. I was curious to see what vets have to do in these situations, as opposed to what medics do.

I’d never thought about the scale of the problem. The figures were quite enormous, unimaginable in fact. Over six million animals died as a result of that typhoon.

Some of the animals killed, maimed and at risk were pets, but far more were farm animals which provide the villagers with a vital source of income.

In the Philippines that mainly means pigs, chickens and the gentle, peaceful water buffalo. If you lose a pig that may mean losing your child’s schooling for a year, not being able to pay for your daughter’s wedding or to get essential hospital treatment.

It’s not that the farmers don’t care about their animals. They do. The pigs in particular are extremely intelligent creatures.

They often seem to exhibit human-like emotions. They are extremely social, like to do things in groups and seem to look out for each other.

After the typhoon, they were in big trouble. Their pens were destroyed, and if they weren’t killed, they were exposed to the searing daytime heat and night-time chill with no protection. 

On one farm my team visited hundreds of pigs had died, so Jennifer, the owner, agreed to let the team use the place to create an experimental type of pig-house, designed to be typhoon-proof, with a detachable roof and a brilliant self-cleaning compost floor. Watching this amazing, innovative construction take shape, was a bit like an episode of Grand Designs for livestock.

The WSPA’s Director of Disaster Management is an adventurous 39-year-old Englishman, James Sawyer from Surrey, but the team were from many countries. Gerardo Huertas, is head of operations, a thoughtful intellectual type with 30 years experience in the field. Juan Carlos Murillo (‘JC’), the main vet, has a strong sense of a calling.

The day-to-day logistics was in the hands of Cinthya Diaz, a bright, and unusual young woman who had started out working as a wedding planner and then got involved with rock music.

She needed those complementary skills to get things done. I really liked their blend of different characteristics. They have a huge appetite for the work, in fact they are quite addicted to the adrenalin rush of going in and sorting things out.

They had been everywhere and done everything. And they were prepared to drop everything and go anywhere at any time. They must have very understanding partners at home.

What’s striking about Juan Carlos Murillo, this team’s vet, is the empathy he has for large creatures. He was trying to teach the local vets more humane ways of handling them. He is a real Dr Dolittle, demonstrating how you can calm a cow or water buffalo down and position it so that you can examine it.

Job well done: After completing their work in the Philippines, the vets headed to Kenya and a drought

JC showed me how to get a buffalo to drink medicine by serving it in a lager bottle gently pushed into its mouth at the side of its tongue.

The beast then rolled it around like Marlon Brando in ‘The Wild One’ rolling his cigarette from side to side, until the medicine had gone down.

Other stand-out moments for me included watching the sperm being collected from a massive boar, enough to sire hundreds of piglets, and a disturbing visit to a farm where they raise fighting cocks.

When they train them they put pads over their spurs, like boxers sparring, but when I saw the long, razor-sharp blades they use for real fights, I decided I had seen enough. 

In the end it became a hearts and minds campaign as the team devised sustainable, economic solutions to animal welfare problems and trained the locals in more effective ways of delivering life-saving treatment.

You’d imagine they might suffer from ‘disaster fatigue’, but they’re surprisingly fresh-faced and enthusiastic about it all, happy to get up at 5.00am and work until a meeting at 10.00pm at night.

And when they had finished in the Philippines, they had new, imminent disasters lined up to head off to next: a drought in Kenya and a possible volcanic eruption in Indonesia.
