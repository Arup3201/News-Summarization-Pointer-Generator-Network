Arsenal are showing further evidence of their growing financial muscle by pressing ahead with plans to revamp their training facilities.

The club's London Colney HQ and Hale End academy are both set for makeovers as the Gunners look to reinforce their position among Europe's elite.

Work has already begun on the club's Hale End site, which houses the club's up and coming talent, with improvements made to indoor and outdoor facilities.

Plans are also in the pipeline to extend the club's already impressive first-team training base, in Hertfordshire.

Gaining planning permission to redevelop the site could be an potential hurdle towards their hopes of expanding London Colney, however.

Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger has confirmed Mathieu Debuchy will miss the next three months after undergoing ankle surgery.

The right-back suffered severe ligament damage during the 2-2 draw against Manchester City on September 13.

'He had surgery on Friday and will be out for three months,' said Wenger.

'It is a blow of course, how big it will be we will only know afterwards because it will be down to how well we replace him.'
