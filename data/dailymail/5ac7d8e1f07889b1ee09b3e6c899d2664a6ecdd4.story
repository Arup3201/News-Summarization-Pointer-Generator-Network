The England World Cup squad were sent off with a smile on their faces today after a comedian tried to board their plane masquerading as a member of the team.

Dressed in a shiny, grey suit and with gelled hair, Simon Brodkin - best known for his comic creation Lee Nelson - pushed past the security guards and attempted to join the squad today as they flew from Luton Airport to Miami for the start of their World Cup training.

The players, including Steven Gerrard, looked on in bemusement as Brodkin, who was in the guise of footballer Jason Bent, a fictitious character from his BBC Three series Lee Nelson's Well Funny People, shuffled into their midst.

The comic was then seen berating Steven Gerrard, demanding to know why he hadn't been picked to represent England in the World Cup, which kicks off on Thursday, June 12.

No other football fans turned up to see the England squad leave for the tournament in Brazil.

The squad will play two friendlies in Florida to begin the final countdown to their World Cup countdown.

They will play matches against Ecuador and Honduras on Wednesday and Saturday, which will give boss Roy Hodgson the chance to give every player a game.
