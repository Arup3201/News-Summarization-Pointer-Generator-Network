At 19-years-old, Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of her chemical engineering degree at Stanford University and used her tuition money to pursue a business idea she hoped would change the landscape of healthcare.

With a major fear of needles, she decided the current system for testing blood - implemented in the 1960s - was archaic, expensive, painful and slow.

Holmes, 30, endeavored to change that method and develop a way that would eradicate the need for vials of blood to be taken and for blood tests to have to take place at the doctors or a lab.

Working mostly in secret for the last 11 years, her company, Theranos, is now valued at $9 billion and, according to Holmes, is changing people's lives.

Revolutionary: The CEO of diagnostic center Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, 30, is the brains behind a $9 billion company that has changed the medical landscape by developing a new method to run blood tests

Theranos' technology requires only a finger prick of blood to be drawn from a patient in order to get fast, effective results.

One drop can run 30 lab tests, the company claims.

Holmes told Wired they can get results in less than four hours.

She said that her fear of needles allowed her to realize that people avoid blood tests for that reason. 

Partnered with Walgreens, the flagship Theranos Wellness Center is based in Palo Alto, California.

There are also 20 others that have opened inside Walgreens around Phoenix.

Patients are able to walk into the stores, have their finger pricked, and get blood results within hours.

The cost, depending on the extent of the tests, averages around $30.

Holmes' goal is to launch Theranos in all 8,200 Walgreens across the country.

'Our work is enabling everyone, no matter how much money they have, or where they live, or what kind of insurance they have, to be able to have access to the kind of testing information that could change their lives,' she told USA Today.

'Theranos is a company dedicated to the belief that access to actionable health information at the time it matters most is a basic human right.'

'Archaic': Holmes decided the current method for testing blood, requiring one or multiple vials of blood and first introduced in the 1960s, was out-of-date and needed to be streamlined

New system: Theranos developed software that allowed blood tests to be performed using a 'micro-sample', needing just a drop of blood taken from a person with a finger prick

Menu: Now in 21 locations - a flagship in California and 20 smaller clinics in Phoenix - Theranos charges different amounts for their blood tests, depending on what is being tested

Now 30, Holmes was the youngest self-made woman on this years Forbes 400 rich list.

Shes owns 50 percent of Theranos, and has a net worth of about $4.5 billion.

'She could totally overturn an entire industry if Theranos is as successful as it seems to be,' Abram Brown, associate editor at Forbes, told Yahoo.

Holmes has a team of influential backers behind her company.

The Theranos board of directors includes former secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, former Defense Secretary William Perry, and former senators Sam Nunn and Bill Frist.

Holmes is getting great responses from patients using the Theranos diagnostic centers.

Dropout: Holmes left her chemical engineering degree at Stanford to develop a way to take the pain and cost out of getting blood tested. She is now worth $4.5 billion

She told USA Today of a diabetic woman who wrote to her that had three fingers picks for a wide-range of blood tests.

She paid $34.

The woman said she had undergone the same tests earlier this year and that it cost her insurance $876.

'When I realized this is what I wanted to do with my life, things got easy,' Holmes told USA Today.

'Because when you reach that moment when you've found what you're born to do, well then you just go do it.'
