The Great Australian Sex Census has revealed that half of Aussies have shared a nude selfie and one in three people have made a sex tape

Aussies prove to be a raunchy bunch according to the latest sex census, which revealed that half of Australians have shared a nude snap and one in three people have recorded themselves in the act.

The Great Australian Sex Census knows no boundaries when it comes to asking intimate questions, inquiring about everything from fetishes and masturbation to penis sizes, and even wandering eyes.

According to this year's results, the survey found that the majority of Australians admit they would jump into bed with someone as early as the first date.

When asked 'how many dates do you have with a person before you have sex with them?', 29 per cent of respondents answered only one, the answer being the most common one given by males.

Women proved to be the more conservative gender when meeting a possible partner, most saying they generally required 'three or more' dates before sharing their bed, the response receiving 26.5 per cent of votes.

The promiscuous revelations continued when respondents were asked how many people they have had sexual intercourse with over their entire lifetime.

Surprisingly, the answer '21 or more' came a close second with 26.3 per cent of votes.

It only just missed out on the top spot, which went to the answer '1-5' partners, by 1.1 per cent.

Clearly embracing the age of technology, one in every two Australians fessed up to having sent someone a naked photo of themselves via their mobile -Â  with more women than men having sent a nude selfie, at 52.2 per cent compared to 44.8 percent.

Sex tapes were also not out of the question with 30.3 per cent of people having already made one and a further 18.7 per cent of people admitting it's on their to-do list.

In the fetishes category, threesomes were on 25.9 per cent of people's bucket lists, while 'rough sex' was the most commonly recorded fetish - more popular among women whom more than 19 per cent of respondents put before BDSM and role play.

In terms of turn-offs, fake boobs received a scathing reception, with more than half of respondents admitting they actually turned them off.

The survey also reinforced some of the bedroom's gender stereotypes, including that the majority of women 'find it extremely difficult and often do not orgasm', admitted by 20.5 per cent of females.

In contrast, more than 60 per cent of male respondents said they often had an orgasm within five minutes or longer.

It was only fitting then, that more than one third of females were found to have faked an orgasm, while more than 70 per cent of males never have.

Where each genders' minds wander during masturbation also proved to vary, with 39 per cent of men admitting they think of porn while women largely answered that they think about their partner.
