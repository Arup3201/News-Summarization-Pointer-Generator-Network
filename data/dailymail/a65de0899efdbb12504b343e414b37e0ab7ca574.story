A corner shop owner embarked on a life of luxury with his wife by executing a 'Prince and Pauper' fraud worth £700,000.

Mohammed Arfan, 39, and his 41-year old wife Riffit pocketed almost £100,000 in tax credits for their four children by saying he was broke and earned only £5,000 a year.

At the same time the couple claimed they were earning £100,000 a year using false references to fraudulently claim a string of mortgage loans.

Mohammed (left) and Riffit Arfan (right) told authorities they earned just £5,000 but they told banks they earned £100,000 to fraudulently claim benefits and secure loans to buy businesses, cars and houses

They owned two homes, two businesses and drove a Range Rover Sport worth £62,000 and a £38,000 BMW X5.

The couple lived in a neat £200,000 semi-detached house in a cul-de-sac in Bury, Greater Manchester and Riffit set up her own fashion business.

Their six-year fraud came to an end in 2010 after Arfan was arrested and charged with dealing drugs at his off licence in Stretford.

Police began investigating the couple's finances and during a two year inquiry discovered they were living a life 'well beyond their means.'

The two houses had been bought as a result of multiple false mortgage applications and Riffit was also found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her fashion shop whilst the couple were claiming tax credits and other significant benefits.

She failed to declare the shop to the authorities and even moved a tenant into the flat above - so could illegally pocket housing benefits.

Today Arfan was starting a three year jail sentence after pleading guilty to 15 offences of mortgage fraud, false accounting, money laundering and fraudulent activity to obtain tax credits.

Riffit pleaded guilty to nine offences of mortgage fraud, false accounting, money laundering and acquiring criminal property and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years.

After the case Ian Horrocks, Financial Investigator from GMP's Serious Crime Division said: 'The Arfans' were living a lifestyle and driving around in cars that many honest hard-working people can only dream of.

'There is no doubt much of this money came from their illegal activities as neither had any discernible legitimate disclosed income that could fund such spending.

'In addition to this, they were still claiming benefits and taking away money that is there to support those who genuinely need it.

'Riffit's CV, which was recovered following her arrest, even went as far to say that she was adept at filling in official forms, such as income support and disability allowance.

'This couple tried to hide their criminal dishonesty behind a tangled web of 24 bank accounts. However, we were able to unpick their finances and discover exactly what money they had been spending.'

Bolton Crown Court heard the applications were dishonestly filled out by the couple to obtain mortgages, loans and state benefits between 2003 and 2009.

Ben Myers, prosecuting, said the police investigation into the couple's finances began in 2010 after Arfan was jailed for four years for drug dealing from his shop and running a cannabis farm, nearby.

It emerged Arfan had claimed to earn just £5,000 a year from his shop to obtain £77,000 benefits only to then falsely say his annual wage was £72,000 to win mortgage loans.

He was granted a loan of £15,000 after giving false references along with his wife and another loan for £38,000 to buy the BMW X5 before converting that to successfully applying to a building society for a mortgage of £174,000.

He then used that money to buy a property in Bury, which was later used to run his cannabis farm.

The couple told banks to buy property and cars including this £200,000 property and a BMW X5

His wife successfully applied for a loan for £93,500, giving a dishonest annual income of £35,000 then used it to buy another property in Bury, from which she set up a fashion outlet.

Yet to the DWP she never declared any income made and sold the property, making a profit.

The couple also jointly applied for a loan to re-mortgage their property - for around £76,000. They acquired the Range Rover through hire purchase.

In mitigation defence counsel Mr Mohammed Qazi, for Arfan, said: 'He expressed deep remorse and real appreciation that he has committed serious offences and how he intends to turn his life around.'

'He met his wife and married her against his family's wishes which led to him being isolated for a number of years. This has led to him seeking to establish his own lifestyle and family.'

For Riffit, defence counsel Mr Jonathan Drury said her business had not been a success and there were still outstanding arrears. She had since been working as a clerk was looking after the children, one of which suffers from a spine disorder.

He added: 'The situation has caused her severed stress and she has been on medication. It's not just her life hanging in the balance; it's also her four children's. They will have to go into care - it would make the damage exceptional.'

Passing sentence Judge Martin Allweis told the couple: 'This was a persistent and sophisticated dishonesty to bolster your income and assets over a period of six years or so.

'You left no stone unturned. You falsely obtained benefits, cheating the public and finance companies by falsely declaring income.'

'I'm told that you're remorseful - but I have no doubt you are sorry you have been caught and I have no doubt you are sorry for the impact on you and your family.'

'But you were cheating the whole public.'
