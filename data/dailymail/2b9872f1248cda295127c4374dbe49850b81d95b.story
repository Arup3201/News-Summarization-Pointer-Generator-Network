Brutally murdered: Police say Jesus Isidor-Mendoza, 18, was raped and drowned before his body was cut in half, wrapped in plastic, placed inside a duffel bag and thrown into a ravine in Tacoma, Washington

Detectives suspect the death was meth-related.

'This gruesome murder is a reminder of how violence the methamphetamine business can be,' Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said in a statement, according to The New York Daily News.

Investigators believe that Isidor-Mendoza met the trio in the garage of Crystal Jackson's house on the night of October 22.

Darrel Arthur Daves lived at the garage, and Wallace Jackson was also there.

The two men are accused of raping Isidor-Mendoza, before drowning his head in a laundry bucket.

Once he was dead, the two allegedly chopped the body in half, wrapped it in plastic and stored it in the garage.

However after two days the cadaver began to smell.

Wallace and Crystal Jackson - who are not related - are accused of putting the body inside a red duffel bag and throwing it down the ravine.

A local then found the remains  after allegedly overhearing Wallace Jackson tell someone about how there was a dead body in the ravine, according to The Tacoma News Tribune.
