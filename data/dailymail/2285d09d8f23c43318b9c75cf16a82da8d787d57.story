An incredibly rare 200-year-old golden 'doubloon' has sold for $7.4million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a gold coin.

The 'Brasher' 1787 doubloon contains 26.66g of gold and is considered the first American-made gold coin denominated in dollars.

Its name comes from Ephraim Brasher, the goldsmith and neighbour of George Washington who minted the coin and whose trademark stamp was taken as proof of a coin's weight and fineness.

As the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia did not begin striking coins until the 1790s, the doubloon's huge historical significance saw it sell for the record sum.

The coin is marked with Brasher's 'EB' hallmark, which the highly-regarded goldsmith only stamped on his own coins.

He mainly struck copper coins from 1787 onwards, but also put his unique stamp on a small number of gold coins.

It is thought the already-extremely rare coin has even greater significance as records show that only seven golden doubloons were made by Brasher.

The coins fetched $2,415,000 for the 
New York Style EB Punch on Wing NGC AU55, $2,990,000 for the unique New 
York Style EB Punch on Breast NGC XF45 and $690,000 for the rare but 
less iconic Lima Style Doubloon.

Trademark: The 'EB' stamp was Brasher's hallmark when he began minting coins in 1787

Blanchard
and Co, the New Orleans-based coin and precious metals company that 
brokered the deal, said the doubloon was purchased by a Wall Street 
investment firm. Identities of the buyer and seller were not disclosed.

Worth about $15 (£10) when it was minted, the gold value today would be more than $1,500 (£965).

All the other six each have the 'EB' 
stamp on the eagle's wing, whereas the latest coin to sell is the only 
one with the 'EB' stamp on the eagle's breast, which may explain the 
world record fee.

The 
latest auction has smashed the previous record for a similar sale where 
three varieties of Brasher doubloons were sold for a combined 
$6.1million in 2005.
