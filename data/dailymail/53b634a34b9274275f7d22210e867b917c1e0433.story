Kate Livesey pictured three weeks before she died from Sudden Death Syndrome

A fit and active nine-year-old girl died suddenly after being struck a previously undetected heart condition while she had a bath.

Kate Livesey was found slumped in the water last February after being struck by Sudden Arrthythmic Death Syndrome (SADS), the same condition that affected footballer Fabrice Muamba.

She died in hospital two days later.

Although Kate’s mother Suzanne, 46, has a history of arrhythmia, Kate, who spent nearly every evening at cubs, swimming lessons or kickboxing, had no warning of the illness. 

Today, after an inquest recorded a verdict of death by natural causes, Kate’s family said they were campaigning for better research into the causes of SADS and had already raised thousands of pounds towards the hospital unit where the youngster was treated. 

The rest of the Livesey family are now getting screened for SADS but doctors have warned the condition may not ever be apparent.

Mrs Livesey, who works at the Job Centre Plus said: 'Losing a child is possibly the worst thing you can go through. 

'When a child is really sick it is a horrendous experience to go through but the only thing I can say it that in most situations parents can see if coming - they have warning - yet we had no warning.

'Her dream was to go on X-Factor - that’s is the one thing she wanted to do.

'She had passions for everything. Every night she going to some club or activity. She loved kick-boxing and to swimming and cubs most nights.

'There needs to be more done to identify or ensure there are ways of detecting SADS as we don’t wish any other parents to go through this.

'A lot of footballers are getting checked for underlying heart conditions and even Muamba was checked before he suffered from it and nothing came up.

'Cardiac Risk in the Young is a great project raising awareness but one of the few.

'There is still very little on the internet on it. When you look for a charity there are reams and reams but when you look for this there is about one website with hardly anything on it.

'In this day and age with information available at the tip of your fingers there should be more on it. There is very little data.'

The inquest in Stockport was told it is rare for SADS to affect young girls, usually presenting in boyspredominantly aged between 14 to 35.

Kate had dreamed of being a pop-star like Cheryl Cole when she was older and wanted to go on XFactor.

The child would always be recording songs and dancing around the family home in Audenshaw, Manchester.

Mrs Livesey said: 'Kate is the loudest, most all singing, all dancing, out there girl - she wasn’t a shrinking violet.

'So when I shouted up to her and heard no response, I went up and I found her on her side with her head in the water.'

Kate was taken to Tameside Hospital but was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital but died on February 7.

Her mother said: 'She always wanted to give to charity and was always asking if we could give to this or that so we decided to donate her organs and she helped four people who got her kidneys, pancreas and liver.'

She added: “One of the things we are looking at is whether we have passed it down to Kate. I had arrhythmia but that can be physically seen.

'You could have a check-up and medical test and nothing would actually present at all and a few weeks later you could just drop. It is like turning a light switch off.

In around 1 in every 20 cases of sudden cardiac death - up to 500 every year in the UK - no cause can be found, despite examination of the heart by an expert cardiac pathologist.

The cause of death is therefore described as 'unascertainable'.

This is called Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, or SADS.

The conditions responsible for SADS cause a cardiac arrest by bringing on a disturbance in the heart's rhythm, even though the person has no structural heart disease.

It is believed there are 160,000 people in the UK with an undetected heart condition.

Anyone with a condition affecting the heart that can cause sudden cardiac death needs to take extra care with medicines.

All medicines - both those prescribed by your doctor and any you buy over the counter - must be checked, as some can increase the risk of sudden death.

'The possibility we are looking at is that I might have a secondary heart condition that we didn’t know about and passed on. It might not be that.

'It may be the case that she is the first in the family to have it. But we now have to make sure Matthew isn’t at risk.'

A few weeks before Kate’s funeral, her father, building supervisor David, 48, found an email on her tablet of a song she recorded which she had emailed to a friend for her birthday.

Her mum said: 'We found the song, it was quite crackly, so we sent it to get it cleaned up.

'We actually put it on a CD and played it at the funeral.. It was the theme tune from a TV programme called Victorious. It was talking about being tomorrow’s fascination and ‘remember me.’

'The words were so poignant. It was brilliant because we wanted it to be her performance - she starred in her own show.'

The Livesey family have been fundraising for the PICI unit at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and have raised around £5,000.

Kate’s older brother Matthew, 14, entered the family in a sponsored run which raised £1,000 for his sister.

This year retired footballer Fabrice Muamba said there was still not enough being done to prevent cardiac deaths.

Two years ago the former midfielder suffered a severe cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane when his heart stopped beating.

Muamba, who retired after the incident but made a full recovery, now works alongside the Professional Footballers' Association to raise awareness of cardiac health.
