I was at Carrow Road on Saturday, Stoke missed some chances because their strikers are useless, then Norwich took control of the game, before Stoke got a dodgy penalty and Jon Walters got himself needlessly sent off. Norwich were unlucky not to win.

The Jon Walters Question…

Is Jon Walters really a Premier League player? What do you think?

He
 left a foot in high on Alex Tettey and he thoroughly deserved his red 
card. There was no need to do it – what was going through Walters’ mind?

Walters was captain at
 his previous club Ipswich Town, but he showed no leadership on 
Saturday, he let his Stoke team-mates down.

There
 are many who criticise the Premier League for a lack of quality. Walters is their poster boy. He works hard, and that’s about it.

Grafter: Jonathan Walters is the epitome of the Stoke team with his industry, but he showed a lack of leadership in getting sent off

It’s an admirable quality for sure, 
but Premier League players should have the whole package, or something 
special that separates them from mere mortal footballers.

Walters’
 story is an example to many in that he was a bit wayward as a 
youngster, released by top flight clubs, and fought his way back.

Saturday’s
 red card aside, he has become a true professional, and that should be 
admired. However, that alone shouldn’t be enough to sustain a top flight
 career.

Maybe I’ve been missing that secret something that makes Walters special.

Too
 many ex-professionals and pundits are blandly kind about footballers. I
 just tell the truth as I see it. I think even some of those who feel 
they have to be nice about Walters, agree deep down with what I’m 
saying.

It’s not rocket science…

Neither side is prolific and I wasn’t expecting a goalfest. The goals that came were not down to great attacking play – Ryan Shawcross must have objected to Bradley Johnson’s BO because he inexplicably stepped away from his man at a set-piece and Johnson headed home. Poor defending.

Stoke’s equaliser was a dodgy penalty.

Breakthrough: It took 56 minutes before Bradley Johnson headed in for Norwich to open the scoring against Stoke at Carrow Road

Delight: Johnson runs away to celebrate with Nathan Redmond after the goal

Spot on: Jonathan Walters earned Stoke a point by converting a 73rd-minute penalty

Shush: Walters expressed delight at his equaliser but he was later sent off for a high challenge on Alex Tettey

Looking over their shoulder: Both Stoke and Norwich are not entirely clear of the relegation dogfight

There are different reasons why these two sides don’t score enough goals: Stoke’s strikers aren’t good enough, Crouch’s best days are behind him. He sometimes struggles to work out whether to use his head or feet, taking so long to make a simple decision the chance is gone.

Let’s just say he’s long since stopped playing off instinct. Crouch also missed a one-on-one early on which set the tone for his 90 minutes.

Is Walters the slowest player in the Premier League? He’s way too slow to cause enough problems.

Stoke need pace and they need a finisher. Actually they need new strikers in the summer, it really is that simple.

Lost instincts: Peter Crouch didn't have his most impressive display against Norwich

Norwich have finishers in Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Gary Hooper – check their records at other clubs, they’re prolific. But they don’t get the service.

In central midfield, Wes Hoolahan is their creative spark but he’s not creative enough, not consistently game in game out.

Robert Snodgrass and Russell Martin were very wasteful with their delivery on the right, Martin Olsson is perhaps guilty of being too cautious on the left – I’d love to see him marauding more down the flank and on the few occasions he has done that this season he’s made a difference.

The star man is Nathan Redmond, he’s fantastic. So good on the ball, his feet are quick and he can take on his man. His final delivery isn’t quite good enough, whether that’s a cross or a shot. He’s being played out wide but I reckon he’d be a superstar in the hole.

If Chris Hughton is brave enough to put him there, I think Norwich could flourish. Those strikers need to be given more clear-cut chances, the Canaries need to be cleverer.

Star man: Nathan Redmond was again impressive for Norwich with his pace and ability to take on defenders

The most ironic penalty of the season…

Go back through some games this season and you’ll find Stoke defenders regularly pulling and pushing, barging and holding opponents as they are trying to keep the ball out of Asmir Begovic’s net. Rarely do they have penalties given against them.

Disbelief: Sebastien Bassong reacts after being adjudged to have fouled John Guidetti, leading to Stoke's equaliser

Yet here at Carrow Road, Sebastien Bassong and John Guidetti went for a ball together, both were equally physical, Guidetti ended up on the ground, the referee gave a penalty. I couldn’t see it.

How do Stoke get away with persistent fouling when they’re defending, and yet they benefited from a frankly ridiculous penalty gifted to them at Norwich.

The most pointless loan move of the season …

Has to be Sweden’s Guidetti switching from Manchester City to Stoke. Before the game the promising striker had played just 40 minutes of football for Stoke since joining in January.

At Norwich he came on after 63 minutes (he came on for Peter Odemwingie who I didn’t realise was playing), won a dubious penalty, and then was substituted 17 minutes later after Walters’ red card.

Used sparingly: John Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, came on as a substitute, won a penalty that Walters (right) converted, and was then subbed off again when Walter got a red card

That won’t please the Swede who was already expressing frustration at a lack of game time under Mark Hughes before January had drawn to a close.

Guidetti scored 20 goals in 23 games for Feyenoord two seasons ago. Stoke lack a decent finisher. Your work it out for yourselves. You’d think Hughes, a great striker in his day, would be able to join up the dots on that one.

At least Walters’ red card means Guidetti should get a chance.

Never forget your history…

Norwich City devoted the matchday to one of their legends, Duncan Forbes. He was a bruising centre half who spent 33 years at Carrow Road on and off the pitch. Now aged 72, Forbes is suffering with Alzheimer's, and is now in a care home.

Sadly he was unable to attend the game, but some of his former team-mates including Martin Peters, were there, along with Forbes’ wife and family. Norwich City raised money for Alzheimer's UK on the day.

All clubs have their legends, some have more than others. It’s a beautiful thing that Norwich City did on Saturday: not just fund-raising, but also ensuring new generations of Norwich fans never forget the legends.
