A 10-year-old boy was tragically killed in a hit-and-run after the car he was traveling in was forced off the road due to icy conditions in Austin, Texas, on Saturday night.

Yahir Vidal was a passenger along with other family members when the driver of the Ford Mustang lost control near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

The car stopped in the outside lane of U.S. 183 and as everyone exited, a white Chevy pickup truck hit the boy and his grandfather.

Icy conditions in Texas have caused a number of accidents in recent days and was a contributing factor in the tragic death of 10-year-old Yahir Vidal

The Chevy then hit another truck driving in the opposite lane and did not stop, reports Statesman.com. The crash was reported about 10:33 p.m. on Saturday.

First responders took the grandfather to the hospital with injuries, but young Yahir was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The child's uncle was also injured, but the Texas Department of Public Safety DPS has not yet released a full list of injuries.

DPS also said that a car carrying more members of Yahir’s family was following his car and stopped when they lost control.
