Dennis Bergkamp could do the unthinkable and join Frank de Boer at Tottenham this summer, according to a source close to the Ajax manager.

De Boer will hold talks with Spurs about becoming their next manager - and he could bring Arsenal legend Bergkamp with him to White Hart Lane. 

Bergkamp has enjoyed huge success working as De Boer's assistant - Ajax wrapped up the Dutch title last weekend - and the fomer Holland team-mates could once again link up at White Hart Lane.

Bergkamp, who made 417 appearances for the Gunners, is still revered in the red half of north London and even has a statue outside the Emirates Stadium.

While it is an unthinkable prospect for Arsenal fans, Dutch football journalist Joep Schreuder recently spoke with De Boer and said it is 'possible' that Bergkamp could link up again with his boss in north London.

Asked whether De Boer would bring Bergkamp and Jaap Stam, the former Manchester United defender who is also his assistant at Ajax, with him to Spurs, Schreuder refused to rule out such a move.

'I have to laugh because I know Arsenal - the team of Bergkamp - and Tottenham are not best friends,' he told talkSPORT.

'Jaap
 Stam, for example, is working with Frank de Boer and he's (supposed to 
be) going to Milan - but maybe he's coming with De Boer to England.

'Maybe also he will bring some players to England, players like Daley Blind, the son of former Ajax captain Danny Blind.

'So it's all possible.'

Bergkamp still has huge affection for Arsenal, while members of the club’s hierarchy have earmarked him as a possible future Gunners boss. 

And given his emotional ties with Arsenal, it seems highly unlikely Bergkamp would agree to join bitter rivals Tottenham.

But the 44-year-old Premier League legend has formed a strong working relationship with De Boer, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles together.

Spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss Tim Sherwood, who is set to leave this summer.

De Boer is a favourite among the Tottenham hierarchy, and speaking on Dutch TV On Tuesday the Holland legend confirmed the club’s interest.

Tottenham’s intention to discuss the managerial role with De Boer was made directly to Ajax director of football Marc Overmars.

'Spurs haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached Ajax, but that’s it,’ said De Boer.

‘Spurs have let Ajax know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished.

‘After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it,’ said De Boer.

‘I’ll talk to them and listen to what they have to say. I would like to add something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool.

‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.
