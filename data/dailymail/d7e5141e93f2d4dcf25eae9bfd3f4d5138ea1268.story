This is the shocking moment a trusted carer is caught stealing money from the purse of a vulnerable pensioner.

The images show Michelle English, 33, taking cash from great-grandmother Jean Robson, aged 83.

Her grandson Chris Murphy caught English stealing from Mrs Robson's purse when he set up a video camera in her living room after becoming suspicious after her money kept disappearing.

Shocking: Carer Michelle English was caught on camera stealing from the purse of vulnerable pensioner Jean Robson after her grandson set up a video camera in the front room

Mr Murphy, of Huntly, Aberdeenshire, said: 'My grandmother has dementia and we noticed money was going missing and initially we thought she might be squirreling it away.

'But it kept happening and we soon worked out that it was a third party that was taking the money.

'So we set up the camera and used an ultraviolet pen to mark the notes. That's how we caught her.

'At the time we had great suspicions it was her (Michelle), but it was still really shocking when we actually saw the footage.

'We were just so aghast that someone would be prepared to steal money from a vulnerable old lady.

'But now I am quite satisfied that a conviction has been secured.

'Hopefully by releasing this footage we can raise awareness and make sure these sort of incidents are cut down.'

English admitted the thefts at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Wednesday and was given a community payback order of 140 hours of unpaid work and forced to pay £100 compensation.

Mr Murphy, also criticised Aberdeenshire Council for failing in its duty to look after his grandmother and may take legal action against them.

He said his mother, Lorna Murphy, and aunt Mellanie Robson raised their concerns with the local authority, but they turned a blind eye to their claims.

Mr Murphy said: 'We are considering suing Aberdeenshire Council. They are liable for what she did, and they breached their duty of trust.'

A Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: 'We do everything possible to make sure carers employed by Aberdeenshire Council are trustworthy and provide excellent care to the people they look after.

'We regret that the trust placed in this particular person was breached. She no longer works for Aberdeenshire Council.'
