Microwaves are great for heating food in a hurry, but what happens if you need to cool, or even, freeze food just as quick? That’s where the Freezer-Wave comes in.

The Freezer-Wave works like a traditional microwave, but when the Freeze switch is pressed pressurised CO2 floods the chamber and surrounds what’s inside.

Depending on how long the switch is pressed for, the food and drinks are either cooled down or frozen completely.

It was designed by Emma Maskery from Peterborough and was recently crowned the winning entry in this year’s Odd Invention Challenge.

Ms Maskery won £5,001 and beat off competition from the Karaoke Shower, Handy Toilet Seat Lifter and Secret Shoe Shine.

Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide that has a surface temperature of -78.5°C (-109.3°F).

As it breaks down, it turns into carbon dioxide gas rather than a liquid and this can be used to keep food frozen, or at least cold, for long periods.

The Freezer-Wave was fitted with two carbon dioxide canisters. 

These canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the Freeze switch.

Tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave. 

When the switch is flicked, the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink.  

The annual competition is run by Oddka - a firm that specialises in flavoured spirits - and judges included inventor and YouTube star Colin Furze, TV presenter Emily Hartridge plus votes from the public.

Mr Furze then built a prototype Freezer-Wave - also known as the Instant Freezing Microwave -to demonstrate its capability.

He fitted a regular microwave with two carbon dioxide canisters. 

These canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the Freeze switch.

Tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave. 

When the switch is flicked, the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink. 

During a demonstration, liquid inside a metal tin began to freeze within minutes, but Mr Furze joked that to freeze it fully would 'probably take about half an hour' using the prototype.

Ms Maskery said: ‘I was sitting at home on a hot day and had a light bulb moment when it came to the Instant Freezing Microwave.

‘Winning £5,001 and actually having my invention made is incredible, and hopefully it’s the start of an Instant Freezing Microwave revolution!’

Runner up Alex Clarry from London, who invented the Karaoke Shower, said: ‘I’m proud my invention came out top among the boys, and all with an idea I dreamt up in the shower one morning.

Second place in the Odd Invention Challenge went to Alex Clarry from London, who invented the Karaoke Shower. His invention (illustrated) includes a waterproof touchscreen, a disco ball shower head and speakers. The touchscreen controls  music and the shower's temperature

Mr Furze also built a prototype version of Mr Clarry's Karaoke Shower (pictured)

‘I’d probably be late for work a few times with a Karaoke Shower.’ 

Mr Furze also built a prototype version of Mr Clarry's invention, which includes a waterproof touchscreen, a disco ball shower head and  speakers. 

The touchscreen controls the music as well as the shower's temperature. 

Other entries included the Beach Ball Chair - a lounger chair made from beach balls - and the Two Way Toothpaste. 

Designed for 'those who get angry with their partner for squeezing the toothpaste from the front,' the Two Way Toothpaste is operated by opening the other end of the tube and squeezing from the back.  

Elsewhere, the Bird Crumb Feeder entry is a tube attached to a chopping board that collects the crumbs created when making sandwiches or slicing bread. 

These crumbs are collected in a well that connects to an outside bird feeder.

Another entry included the Bird Crumb Feeder (pictured). It features a tube attached to a purpose-built chopping board that collects the crumbs created when making sandwiches or slicing bread. These crumbs are collected in a well that connects to an outside bird feeder

Gadget works as a regular microwave until the Freeze button is switched

Carbon dioxide is then blasted into the microwave and freezes the contents

It can also cool down food and drinks that are too hot to be consumed

The time it takes to freeze food and drink depends on what is being frozen
