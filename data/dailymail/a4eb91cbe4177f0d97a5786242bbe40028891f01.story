Arsenal legend Tony Adams has launched a scathing attack on Jack Wilshere, believing that the midfielder should have taken the arrival of Mesut Ozil as 'a personal insult'.

In an interview with The Sun, the former Gunners captain, who played nearly 700 games for club, also questioned the midfielder's professionalism and desire both on and off the pitch.

'If push came to shove, for a cup final or big match, Arsene would pick Ozil ahead of Jack,' said Adams.

Preparation: Wilshere is challenged by Kieran Gibbs in Arsenal training on Saturday

Questioned: The midfielder's professionalism was also queried by the former Arsenal legend

Acquisition: Ozil arrived at the Emirates Stadium for a record fee last summer

'He should have taken it as a personal insult that Arsenal went out and signed Ozil when they already had the same talent at their disposal in him.'

Whilst Adams refrained from suggesting that Wilshere should be held accountable for the controversy surrounding his smoking on holiday this summer, he did say that the midfielder desperately needs to up his game this season.

'He must show more hunger and professionalism. He's in danger of not fulfilling his potential and his career could be over in the blink of an eye.

'He has to be more verbal, shake things up and show more fire in his belly.'

Critical: Adams warned Wilshere not to let his career pass him by

Hero: The defender played nearly 700 games for the club during a 15-year career at Highbury
