A 28-year-old mother could spend the rest of her life in prison for causing a car crash that killed her 4-year-old daughter last year. 

The trial for Starr Kiogima -McGill started Monday in Charlotte, Michigan and she faces charges of second-degree murder and drunk driving causing death. 

In opening statements, prosecutors argued that the Grand Ledge, Michigan woman recklessly caused her daughter Natalie Ann-Marie McGill's death by driving drunk and high on painkillers.

Kiogima-McGill's defense did not make opening statements yesterday, but have previously said that the crash was an accident caused when the mother got distracted trying to hand a bag of candy to her daughter sitting in the back seat.

If convicted of second-degree murder, Kiogima-McGill could spend the rest of her life in prison. The drunk driving causing death charge carries a maximum 15-year sentence.  

'This is a case about Natalie McGill, a 4-year-old girl who lost her life,' Eaton County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Anderson told the jury on Monday. 'This is a case about alcohol, and about Natalie's mother — the defendant — and her consumption of alcohol ... It's about controlled substances, and the defendant's choice to consume controlled substances.'

Anderson revealed that Kiogima-McGill's blood-alcohol content was three times the legal limit when she lost control of her 1997 red Ford Expedition around 1:37pm on September 11, 2013, causing it to strike another vehicle and roll several times before coming to a rest in the middle of a median on I-96.

Traces of the painkiller Oxycontin and anti-anxiety pill Lorazepam were also found in the suspect's system. 

Evidence at the scene  suggested that Kiogima-McGill didn't secure her daughter's car seat properly, if at all.

On Monday, a couple who was hit by Kiogima-McGill in the accident and the first police officer to arrive on the scene testified about what they saw the day of the crash. 

Eaton County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Block said he didn't smell alcohol on Kiogima-McGill when he first encountered her on the scene, but said he wasn't looking for signs of intoxication at the time. Kiogima-McGill was also critically injured in the crash and taken to a local hospital for treatment. 

Kiogima-McGill's sister Misty shared a story on the woman's trial on Facebook yesterday, writing: 'That's my sister.. I know her [first] hand. Yes, she made a terrible mistake and it resulted in the life of her daughter Natalie Ann Marie McGill. She is a caring, loving, wonderful mother, wife, daughter, sister, etc. She lost apart of her September 11, 2013.

'Natalie was her everything along with her other daughters. And she lost a part of her that day. Never will be the same and that's punishment enough. 

'She has [three] other daughters [who] need their mother. Just don't judge a book by it's cover. Free my baby sister. She suffered enough, never will be the same.. But will remain the caring kindhearted wonderful person she is.'
