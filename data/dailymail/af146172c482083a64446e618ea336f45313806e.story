A federal politician has slammed the #illridewithyou social media movement as a 'pathetic left wing' campaign.

Nationals MP George Christensen hit out against the hashtag - which was started in the midst of the Sydney Lindt cafe siege to show  solidarity with the Muslim community - in a series of tweets on Wednesday.

The member for Dawson, in north Queensland, wrote: '#illridewithyou is a typical pathetic left wing black arm band brigade campaign, casting Aussies as racists who will endanger Muslims.'

Two hostages died in the early hours of Tuesday morning after being held hostage for 17 hours by self-proclaimed Islamic cleric Man Haron Monis.

Another 16 hostages managed to escape after being forced to send out messages on social media, YouTube and to media outlets claiming Monis was working on behalf of the Islamic State.

The #illridewithyou campaign has been endorsed high profile people from actor Russell Crowe to U.S. President Barack Obama - and has been used on social media more than 500,000 times. 

Mr Christensen followed up his first comment with another series of tweets, and replied to detractors while posting links to ring-wing blogs that criticised the two women who inspired and started the hashtag.

'#weridetogether & #illridewithyou - typical lefty campaigns that creates false victims. Focus on real #sydneysiege victims: Tori & Katrina,' he wrote.

'#weridetogether & #illridewithyou are typical lefty campaigns that falsely portrays Aussies as thugs who endanger Muslims.

The member for Dawson, in north Queensland, hit out against the hashtag  in a series of tweets

'As I suspected. The #illridewithyou campaign is proudly brought to us by another #hatingwhitey lefty activist.'

'Hating whitey' is a term used to describe 'anti-white racism of the Left', popularised by American conservative writer David Horowitz.

One of Mr Christensen's colleagues, Liberal MP Ewen Jones, criticised Mr Christensen's stance and distanced himself from the comments.

'Completely insensitive and ignorant of the motive,' Mr Jones tweeted. 

Twitter user Tessa Kum (@sirtessa) began what has become a worldwide phenomenon, offering to sit next to members of the Islamic faith on transport if they were frightened to be seen in public wearing religious clothing.

After Ms Kum noticed a disturbing trend of anti-Muslim sentiments, she wrote to those on her regular bus: 'wear religious attire, & don’t feel safe alone: I’ll ride with you'.

She was inspired after reading a Facebook post written by another woman, Rachael Brown, who saw a Muslim woman take her headscarf off on the train and offered to walk with her so she felt safe.

Ms Kum told theABC that 'it just seemed that a simple way of promoting kindness would be to say if anybody catching public transport didn't feel comfortable just because of what they were wearing, I would sit next to them, so they weren't alone'.

The hashtag was soon picked up by her 3,183 followers, gaining support from fellow Australians who offered lifts to work, promises of protection, and friendship to anyone feeling threatened.  

The hashtag has gained worldwide attention and has been used more than 500,000 times
