Arsenal, Everton and Stoke will travel to Singapore to complete in the Barclays Asia Trophy during their pre-season preparations in July, the Premier League have announced.

The competition is held every two years, but will take place in Singapore for the first time since its inception in 2003, coinciding with the country's 50th anniversary celebrations.

Arsenal and Stoke will be making their debut appearances in the tournament - which is the only Premier League-affiliated competition to take place outside England - while Everton are competing for the first time since 2005.

'We are very excited to bring the Barclays Asia Trophy to Singapore for the first time,' he said. 'We know Singaporeans love their football and that they are huge fans of the Barclays Premier League. 

'Arsenal have always been one of the most thrilling teams in the Premier League: they have some wonderful players and I’m sure they’ll delight their many fans from across Southeast Asia.

The competition will take place over two match-days, on Wednesday 15 and Saturday 18 July. The format sees two semi-finals on Day One, before a final and third-place playoff on the Saturday.

Matches will take place in a state-of-the-art 55,000-capacity venue, with a retractable roof and every seat in the stadium cooled by environmentally-sustainable technology.

The previous tournament, in 2013, was won by Manchester City after they defeated Sunderland in the final in Hong Kong. 

The semi-finals of the competition were marred by torrential rain, resulting in 80-minute matches rather than the scheduled 90.

Prior to that, Chelsea beat Aston Villa 2-0 in the 2011 final, also at the Hong Kong Stadium in So Kon Po.
