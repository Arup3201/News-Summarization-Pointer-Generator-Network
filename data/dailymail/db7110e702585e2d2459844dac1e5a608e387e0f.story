Facebook founding president Sean Parker has hit back at a ValleyWag report claiming he hired people to plow snow into the middle of the street so he could have super fast internet access.

The billionaire entrepreneur says he did not hire a work crew to plow the snow into the middle of West 10th Street so he could drop Time Warner Cable for Verizon FiOS and claims he hasn't lived at the house for years.

Parker’s desire for FiOS was so great that he was willing to upset the fragile relationships most New Yorkers share with each other in such close quarters, a source told Gawker's ValleyWag. The article also said he paid to have the snow shoveled into the road up to his house, but then stopped short.

He also said he only found out about the incident after reading MailOnline's report detailing the accusations.

Clear path: A worker was seen Friday morning shoveling snow in front of the 10th Street home as the street was covered in snow

Careless: The snow was piled into the road without any care for neighbors or drivers

High and dry: Sean Parker, pictured at the 2012 SXSW Music Festival, is denying a ValleyWag report claiming he had the snow cleared to make way for a Verizon crew

'This was news to me,' Parker wrote in an email. 'I just learned of this via your article.'

The snow was pushed into and up the narrow one-way street away from the home to provide a Verizon crew space to hook up his $20million dollar pad with faster internet access than cable could provide, the source said.

Pictures show a clear disparity in the snow cover leading traffic east towards Fifth Avenue from the six bedroom, seven-and-a-half bath palace and the bare pavement west towards Sixth Avenue.

Parker said he no longer lives in the tony townhouse and has not 'for almost 2 years.'

'My wife and I have been living in midtown and we have no idea what is happening on that block,' he added.

Parker admitted preparations have been underway for the new owner, but said he has not been kept in the loop, adding that he 'can't imagine why anybody would be digging around in the snow.'

The brazen move came as New Yorkers have been suffering through the one of the coldest and snowiest winters in recorded history due to the Polar Vortex.

Central Park has already received 56.6 inches of snow already, with nearly half falling this month alone, according to the National Weather Service. This winter is already into the top five snowiest in history.

The city has a realistic shot at 
reaching the all-time record of 75.6 inches set during the winter of 
1994-95 with another month-and-a-half of realistically cold enough 
weather for winter storms.

All clear: Orange cones and a lack of snow mark the front of the tony townhouse

Infuriating: Neighbors are said to be furious at the lack of regard for their safety by piling the snow into the middle of the busy, narrow street

Fantasy wedding: Parker's lavish wedding to Alexandra Lenas took place in a California redwood forest

A Verizon spokesperson declined to 
speak about the matter to Valleywag, and Sean Parker did not immediately
 return a MailOnline message seeking comment.

Parker
 potentially tossing snow into the street for his own convenience isn’t 
the first stunt involving the billionaire that has furrowed more than a few eyebrows.

He
 and wife Alexandra Lenas were married last year in a lavish ‘Lord of 
the Rings’-themed wedding ceremony in the middle of a California redwood
 forest that cost the Napster co-founder several million dollars.

Before: The redwood forest as it was prior to Parker's wedding

Under construction: Fauna was removed from the forest floor, leaving only the towering redwoods behind

The bridge to destruction: Parker's wedding planners significantly modified the forest, even building a stone bridge

Destroyed: Some of the work even damaged the protected redwood trees - leading to millions in fines

The wedding featured a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout.

Environmental damage caused by the event cost Parker another $2.5million paid to the California Coastal Commission to settle fines related to building the movie set-like wedding without proper permits.
