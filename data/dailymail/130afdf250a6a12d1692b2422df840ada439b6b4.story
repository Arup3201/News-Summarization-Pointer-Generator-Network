The son of a 7/7 victim whose mother stole his £50,000 compensation says he has no sympathy for her as she is jailed for 30 months.

Adam Gray, who was 11 when his father Richard was killed in the terrorist attack, entrusted the sum to his mother Louise for safe keeping on his 18th birthday. 

After blowing the money on seven chihuahuas, new cars and expensive dinners at Ritz, the 42-year-old widow was told to reimburse her son in civil court. 

Having failed to repay the money,  she was  jailed  after being found guilty of theft at Ipswich Crown Court, and imprisoned for 30 months.

Speaking of her sentencing, Mr Gray, now 20, said she has 'brought it on herself'. 

'To be honest, based upon how she has approached this whole situation, I feel like she has brought this upon herself and I don’t have any sympathy,' he said. 

'It was even stated that she showed no emotion in the court room. Even now, she’s shown no remorse and continues to try and play the victim and manipulate everyone around her.' 

Ipswich Crown Court heard how following his father's death in 2005, Mr Gray was awarded £50,000 and his sister £100,000 in compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.  

The money was placed in a trust fund until their 18th birthdays. 

But after turning 18, Mr Gray entrusted the money to his mother for safe keeping, worried he was not responsible enough at the time to handle such a large sum.  

When he asked for access to it in 2013 to move to London from Ipswich, Suffolk, he was told it was all but gone - his mother having already spent the £250,000 given to her separately.  

While Mr Gray said he 'should not have had' to go to such extreme lengths, he is hopeful a prison stint will make his mother feel remorse.

'I don’t think she’ll cope very well in prison, I think it’ll be hard for her.

'She’s in a situation where she’ll have to tell everyone inside what she’s done. It’s not going to be a holiday for her.

'She’ll have to say that she stole her son’s money and the chances are the other inmates will be mothers.

'I don’t think this is going to be an easy time for her. I’m not sure if I’m going to visit her or not.

'Part of me hopes that she might actually learn from this experience but I don’t want to get my hopes up as so far she’s shown no remorse. 

'I lost my dad as a young child, and now I’ve lost my mum.'

In court the woman's behaviour was described as 'an act of wickedness beyond belief.' 

Sentencing, Judge David Goodin said of Mr Gray: 'He has lost not one parent, but two.' 

Judge David Goodin said: 'It's an act of wickedness almost beyond belief. He has lost not one parent, but two.'

'The theft of £43,000 is one thing. The theft of £43,000 by a parent from a young adult's trust is quite another, when that sum represented most - practically all - the compensation he received for his father's tragic death.

'The offence you have committed against your son, the trust you betrayed - a second hammer blow following the death of his father - is so serious it can only be met by a custodial sentence.

'The loss of a father in any circumstances, particularly in such violent circumstances, would have been a grievous blow to an 11-year-old Adam. Nobody would have known that better than you.'

In November 2013 the woman was sued by her son after revealing she had spent most of the money. 

She was ordered to repay him £43,750 but refused to do so after unsuccessfully appealing the verdict of the civil case. 

It was then police became involved, pursuing the mother-of-three on a count of theft. 

During the Crown Court trial, it was heard Gray, who has a three-year-old daughter with partner Umar Shamshoom, sent her 20-year-old son a text message pleading with him to bring the case to a halt. 

'If you prosecute me, I will lose you. I can't face that,' the message is said to have read.

Adam was 11 years old when his father Richard was killed in the suicide bomb attack on a Tube train near Aldgate station in 2005 (pictured). He was left £50,000 compensation and it was put in a trust until he was 18

She is also said to have told Mr Gray she feared for her health and thought she had a tumour, an 'unfounded' claim according to Prosecutor Michael Crimp. 

'To him it seemed like a guilt trip. The effect was, as far as he was concerned, emotional blackmail on him,' Mr Crimp said. 

Previously defending barrister Richard Conely denied claims his client had 'frittered away' her son's money, describing her circumstances following her husband's death as 'impossible'. 

'This is a case which is rooted in tragic circumstances which came about when a terrorist detonated a bomb on the Circle line,' he said.

'His assault destroyed the lives of countless others in ways he and his co-conspirators could never have imagined.'

'She was living in a situation where she simply couldn't work ... paying the ordinary annual amount to meet the cost of living, in the region of £30,000 or thereabouts,' he said. 

Previously Mr Gray said his mother left him no choice but to take legal action. 

'I felt confusion when the police told me she could face prison. But at the same time I wanted some justice for what she had done to me.

'She never showed me any remorse and she made me feel as if everything was my fault. Although it is hard to think of your own mother going to prison because of a crime she has committed against you, I believe that I deserve some form of justice.

'Hopefully she will be forced to pay me the money now. But I should not have had to go to such extreme lengths. Sadly, she left me no choice.' 

He did not attend her sentencing in Ipswich Crown Court today.  

Louise spent the £43,000 on lavish shopping sprees, a fleet of new cars, dinner at the Ritz, seven dogs and a jacuzzi for the family home. She was jailed today for more than two years. Pictured: The Aldgate wreckage
