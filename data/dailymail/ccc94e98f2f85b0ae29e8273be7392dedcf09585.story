Samsung Electronics Co. is free to sell its Galaxy tablet computers in Australia after the country's highest court dismissed rival Apple's appeal in its global patent battle

The copyright and patent battle 
between the two companies rages on, but Samsung Electronics has won 
another important round - Australia's highest court dismissed rival Apple’s appeal, leaving Samsung free to sell its Android tablets this Christmas.

It follows similar rulings in cases in Germany, the Netherlands and America.

Following the ruling, Samsung said in a statement that its Galaxy Tab 10.1 'will be available in stores this holiday period.'

Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a tablet running Google's Android system which is lighter and thinner than iPad 2.

Apple took Samsung to court in Australia after accusing the South Korean company of copying its iPad and iPhone.

The battle began in April, when 
Cupertino, California-based Apple sued Samsung in the United States, 
alleging the product design, user interface and packaging of Samsung’s 
Galaxy devices 'slavishly copy' the iPhone and iPad.

But a U.S. court recently ruled 
Samsung was free to sell Galaxy devices in the U.S, a decision analysts 
said could 'turn the tide' in favour of Samsung.

The companies are embroiled in bitter
patent disputes in 10 countries - but none is more important than the 
U.S., Samsung's biggest market.

The three leading rivals in the tablet market: Samsung and Apple are locked in a bitter patent dispute in several countries

Samsung
surpassed Apple as the world’s top smartphone maker in the third 
quarter and a ruling to temporarily halt U.S. sales of Galaxy 
smartphones could have negatively affected its growth momentum just as 
Apple released the iPhone 4S in early October.    

'We
believe the legal uncertainties between Samsung and Apple are waning, 
or put in another way, the situation is turning positive for Samsung,' 
said Nomura analyst CW Chung.    

The battle has only intensified as sales of Samsung's cult Galaxy handsets have bitten into Apple's market share.

Samsung is now the biggest smartphone company on Earth, by revenue and by volume, beating both Nokia and Apple.

Android  phones now account for 52.5 per cent of the smartphone market - and Apple's just 16.6.

But
its Galaxy Tab isn't going to have an easy ride, even if it DOES go on 
sale - both Galaxy and iPad 2 are now being aggressively undercut by 
Amazon's new Kindle Fire tablet, which is roughly half the price of 
either.

Fire has remained Amazon's best-selling item for eight weeks running.

At
least one major American retailer said it outsold iPad 2 on Black 
Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza seen as 'kicking off' the
shopping season in America.

'It’s
hard to expect the ruling to have a major positive impact on Samsung’s 
tablet business or legal cases in other countries as Apple could appeal -
and sales won’t be restored anytime soon,' said Song Myung-sub, an 
analyst at HI Investment & Securities in Seoul.   

A Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 on display in Seoul: Despite the Australian ruling, legal battle still rages between the two companies and Apple is to sue for a European ban on December 22

Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle in 10 
countries involving smartphones and tablets since April.

At one point, Apple forced Samsung to withdraw its Galaxy tablet from a technology trade show where it was not even on sale.

Samsung has attempted to ban iPhone 4S in several territories.

The 
Australian dispute centres on touchscreen technology used in Samsung’s
new tablet.    

The quarrel had triggered expectations that some of the pair’s $5 
billion-plus relationship may be up for grabs.

Samsung openly describes Apple as its 'biggest customer'.   

Ironically, the A5 chip in both iPad 2 and iPhone 4S still seems to be made by Samsung.     

'Apple will continue to dominate the tablet market as Amazonappears to be the only viable threat at the moment and other vendors, including Samsung, continue to struggle.'    The
ruling is, however, a timely boost for Samsung ahead of the busy 
pre-Christmas shopping season. While the Australian market is not large,
it is a key launch market for Apple products outside the United 
States.   

Apple
was granted an injunction against Samsung in October, temporarily 
barring Australian sales of the Galaxy 10.1 tab, which had been seen as 
the hottest competitor to Apple’s iPad until Amazon.com Inc launched its
Kindle Fire.       

Samsung
is the world’s top smartphone maker, but a distant second to Apple in 
tablets. The intensifying legal battle has undermined its efforts to 
close the gap.   

Copyright
experts have been aghast at some of the issues raised - claiming that 
some of the legal measures used by the companies could result in bans of
other devices, or even whole classes of technology.
