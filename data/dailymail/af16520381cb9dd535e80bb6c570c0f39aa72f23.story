The soaring value of the pound has provided a major boost for British holidaymakers.

Breaks in Europe have become more affordable as sterling has risen strongly against the euro and other currencies.

It means trippers get nearly 15 per cent more for their money than a year ago, according to the Post Office Travel Money City Costs Barometer.

Last month the pound hit a seven-year high against the euro at 1.35 euros, knocking about £70 off the cost of a £500 trip compared with 2014.

Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination, says a study

Budapest, Hungary, also offers British travellers a great deal, with a weekend getaway tallying £119.77

However, a trip to the US has become significantly more expensive, with £500 buying only $722.45, down from $797 a year ago. 

City breaks have overtaken beach holidays as the most popular getaway choice for British tourists, according to a new study.

With the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies, prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in Post Office Travel Money's annual report on city costs.

Eastern European cities offer bargain hunters the best value with Vilnius, Lithuania, topping the list.

The newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year-on-year with a three-course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights' accommodation coming in at just £100.04.

The cost of a weekend break in Vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites Paris, Rome and Amsterdam.

Budapest is another great money-saving destination, where a two night getaway comes in at just £119.77. 

And in Riga, travellers will not only benefit from cheap transport options, but also the cheapest rate (£36) for a two-night stay in a three-star city centre hotel during the month of April.

In Riga, Estonia, not only is transport extremely affordable, but three-star city centre hotels are cheapest

And when it comes to Western Europe, Post Office Travel Money recommends heading to Athens for a deal

1. Vilnius, Lithuania - £100.04 

2. Budapest, Hungary - £119.77

3. Riga, Latvia - £120.39

4. Tallinn, Estonia - £131.28

5. Athens, Greece - £131.35

6. Dubrovnik, Croatia - £139.83

7. Prague, Czech Republic - £141.24

8. Lisbon, Portugal - £141.37

9. Krakow, Poland - £144.96

10. Strasbourg, France - £169.60

But it's not only Eastern Europe that offers UK tourists some serious value.

Athens, which is a new entry in the report, comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just £131.35, which puts it as the cheapest in Western Europe.

Last year's cheapest Western break, Lisbon, dropped to eighth place this year.

The Czech city of Prague also offers great bang for a British traveller's buck, boasting cheap meals and drinks. 

Dining out costs as little as £23.94 for two people, while a bottle of beer is just £1.13.

Krakow, Poland, and Strasbourg, France, are two additional new entries to the list this year.

Proving that not all French cities must be needlessly expensive, Strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than Paris.

For the third consecutive year, Stockholm is Europe's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of £311.01 for a two-night getaway.

London is the seventh most expensive city break, with costs averaging £266.65, according to the study.

While perennial favourite, Paris, is a very expensive French destination, Strasbourg offers good value

If money is not a concern, Stockholm has been named Europe's most expensive city for the third year in a row

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It's a win/win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling.'

However, he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out, as prices do vary significantly across cities.

'Remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget, as city breaks are never all-inclusive holidays,' he explains.

'Over the course of a two- or three-night break, these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in Prague, Athens and Budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the Baltic states.'
