40 per cent of all missing persons are black

A renewed campaign to highlight hundreds of missing African-American women has been launched amid ongoing criticism that less attention is given to their cases by authorities and the media.

According to the National Crime Information Center, nearly 40 per cent
 of those who have disappeared, often in suspicious circumstances, are black. However critics allege that public
attention mainly focuses on white women who have vanished.

According to the Black And Missing Foundation, most women disappear in the states of New York, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland and Florida.

Vanished: Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis (left) disappeared on December 18 while Stacey English (right) was last seen on Christmas Day. Both women's cars were found with the engine running

A total of 273,985 minorities
                                            were reported missing in the United
                                            States (out of 692,944 for all
                                            races) as of December 2010.

The foundation has 
teamed up with a TV network to make a series, Find Our Missing, telling the stories behind the women's disappearances.

The non-profit organization was formed in 2008 to 
draw attention to cases and keep pressure on authorities when leads and information dry up.

The Black And Missing 
Foundation told MailOnline there are a number of reasons as to why the cases of missing
 black women are largely forgotten.

Firstly, the organisation points out
 that there is often a lack of diversity in newsrooms meaning the 
African-American community is not properly reflected in coverage.

Not forgotten: Ashani Creighton, now 19, (left) was abducted by her grandparents from Orlando in 1998 while Sharaun Cole, now 41, (right) was last seen outside her New York home in 1983 but few details are known about her disappearance. These photos have been doctored to show the ageing process

Another key reason is that missing 
persons from a lower economic status are often associated with some sort
 of criminal activity.

Behind the hundreds of cases are 
painful details sketched out by families, left wondering what has become
 of their loved ones. Many women have been missing for decades.

In two incidents at the end of last 
year, a chilling connection was made between two missing women - 500 
miles apart -  discovered in part because of the attention charities 
brought to their cases.

Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis, Missouri, went missing on December 18 while Stacey English, 36, vanished in Atlanta, Georgia on Christmas Day 2011.

Remember me: The FBI's National Centre for Missing Persons reports that almost 40 per cent of those missing are African-American

Startling: A total of 273,985 minorities were reported missing in the United States, according to the FBI in 2010  - this is the percentage breakdown  based on race

The cars of both women were abandoned with the engine running and the keys in the ignition.

In both cases the cars were impounded, a fact that police in both cities
 did not realize until several days into the investigations.

Miss Coldon's mother Goldia Coldon said at the time that the fact both women were African-American had not gone unnoticed. 

A separate non-profit group, Black And Missing But Not Forgotten had also picked up on the cases.

There were other heartbreaking cases where 
years have passed without any clues to where the women have gone, 
leaving anguished families with little hope of closure.

Arnika Miller, now aged 33, disappeared on August 21, 2010 from Topeka, Kansas. Before she went missing, it is alleged that Miss Miller told a co-worker that her boyfriend and his friends had assaulted her and stolen her identification and money and that she was afraid of them. She had duel citizenship with Canada. Her family are deeply concerned for her safety as she is an insulin-dependent diabetic and she may have had a broken leg. Her last sighting was unknown.

Asia Nicole Martin, now 26, was last seen on May 27, 2005 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She told her roommate that she was going for a walk at 8.40pm and never came home. The student bought a bus ticket to visit her mother in Denver but never boarded it. Her roommate said that she was acting normally when she left, but her family are concerned that something may have happened to her as it was unusual for her not to contact them and she has an unspecified medical condition.

Tilawna Cheatham, now 31, disappeared on August 11, 1989 when she was nine years old in Aiken, South Carolina. Her photo has been age progressed to show what she would look like, aged 27. The girl was last seen after she argued with her mother, took spare change from a jar and left home. Two neighbours spotted the girl at 5.30pm at a convenience store a few blocks from her house.

Latoria Renae McClarin, 27, went missing on November 1 from Goldsboro, North Carolina. She left her house with a man, identified as Ray, and told her family she would be right back. Ray is believed to be an acquaintance from the city of Wilson in the state but Miss McClarin's family don't know anything else about him. She does not have medication that she needs with her.

Ashani
 Karin Creighton, who would now be 19, was last seen by her mother in 
Orlando, Florida after being initially abducted by her grandparents, Ernest S. Jackson and Kaia Jackson in 1998.

It is time for all people - regardless of race - to be treated equally in their times of greatest need.

Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation

The 
grandparents were taken into custody in 2000. Miss Creighton is feared dead 
but what happened to the teenager is still unknown.

In the case of Sharon Davis, now 61, 
who has been missing for eleven years, she was last seen at 7am on June 
13 after being dropped off by her daughter in a Dallas parking lot.

She had said she was going home to 
change her clothes for a meeting but her van was later found abandoned.

The vehicle had a broken window and was wiped clean of fingerprints.

Her two children alleged that Ms 
Davis's husband may know more about her disappearance as she  had filed 
for divorce two days before she was last seen.

Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation, told ABC: 'When we hear the term ''missing 
persons'', most people conjure up images of Chandra Levy, Caylee Anthony 
or Natalee Holloway.

'As a result, the public is misled in
 believing that victims of abductions and kidnappings are [all] blonde, 
blue-eyed and female.'

Still out there? Shandell McLeod (l), 35, was last seen on October 1 in Lithonia, Georgia - her family fear her life is in danger. Sharon Davis vanished in 2001 after her van was found abandoned in a Dallas parking lot

In danger: Sharnecia Monique Frazier (l) has been missing since 2005 and would now be 22 - she was last seen in Montgomery, Alabama. Sheila Hughes was nine months pregnant when she vanished in Aliceville, Alabama in 2000

Ms Wilson added: 'It is time for all people - regardless of race - to be treated equally in their times of greatest need.'

The Black and Missing Foundation was set up by a former law enforcement officer and public relations experts to support families and raise awareness of those who have disappeared. It also offers tips on personal safety.

A new series, Find Our Missing, begins tonight on the TV One network.
