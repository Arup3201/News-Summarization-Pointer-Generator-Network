The activities are familiar, but there is something afoot with the faceless characters doing them.

These bizarre images are part of an exhibition created using the feet and claws of dead animals.

A solitaire-playing alligator, a lobster playing pool and a pig smoking a cigar are some of the creations by a pair of U.S. artists who have transformed human habits into quirky - but morbid - scenes.

Can you guess which cold-blooded creature is playing cards? Here's a clue - after he has tried his hand at solitaire he might be up for a game of 'snap'

Lobster pot: Mr Luciano said the inspiration for Cold Feet came as the couple were taking a stroll in NYC's Chinatown, with the variety of animal feet sparking the idea

Mr Luciano added: 'From there the rest just came to life, Claudia and I thought of other activities the various animals could do - and created the scenes using props and animal limbs'

Mr Luciano said: 'The inspiration for 
Cold Feet came as we were taking a stroll in NYC's Chinatown, with the 
variety of animal feet sparking the idea.

'The chicken feet were what sparked 
the concept for the series, Claudia felt the chicken nails were so 
pretty, she jokingly mentioned wanting to paint them with nail polish.'

Ms Ficca struck upon the idea after joking the chicken nails were so pretty, she wanted to paint them with nail polish

'From there the rest just came to 
life, Claudia and I thought of other activities the various animals 
could do - and created the scenes using props and animal limbs.

'We got all the props we needed with the help of prop stylist Maeve Sheridan and we shot the series out of our Brooklyn studio.
