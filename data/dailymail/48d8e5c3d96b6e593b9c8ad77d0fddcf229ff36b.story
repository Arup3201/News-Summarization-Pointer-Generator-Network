Police SWAT team members converged on a Philadelphia-area firehouse after a report of hostages on Tuesday ended with the arrest of a former volunteer firefighter.

A call about an armed man at the LaMott Fire Company in Cheltenham Township, about 10 miles north of downtown Philadelphia, came in at about 10:40 a.m. Tuesday.

The suspect, about 30 years old, threatened the men as he entered the fire company and sounded 'very upset' as he talked to a hostage negotiator.

Swarmed: A reportedly disgruntled firefighter was taken from a firehouse outside Philadelphia on Tuesday after reports of an armed man and hostage situation had police SWAT members swarming the building in Cheltenham Township before noon Tuesday

Disgruntled? Police say the suspect is an ex-firefighter who was in a dispute with the fire company up until yesterday

Footage showed the man coming out of the fire house with his arms up as police aimed guns at him, forced him to the ground and frisked him before cuffing him and hauling him off in a van.

According to 6abc.com, police say the suspect is a former firefighter who was in a dispute with the fire company up until yesterday, when he was reportedly fired.

After he allegedly entered the building, a shot rang out and employees scattered.

All but four firefighters remained inside. 

'Before we received the call he did fire one shot into the wall,' Cheltenham Township Police Chief John Norris told NBC Philadelphia.

The suspect immediately released one of the hostages before holding three firefighters hostage for about an hour before police were able to diffuse the tense situation.

 Heavily armed SWAT members entered the firehouse through an open garage and then closed a door behind them.

Some fifteen minutes later, after apparently talking the firefighter down, police emerged from the firehouse along with the suspect.

'He gave up to the SWAT team without a fight, there were no problems,' said  Norris told. 'The main thing is nobody got hurt.'

Police say the firefighter shot one shot into a wall before their arrival at the scene. The firehouse was being processed as a crime scene.

Meanwhile, police shut down the area surrounding the small firehouse, which is near a park and two schools. 

Officials praised the hostages' fortitude.

'They're a great bunch of guys,' township fire marshal Joseph O'Neill said. 'You couldn't ask for a better bunch.'

The suspect and hostages were taken to a police station for questioning, Norris said. He wasn't sure what charges would be filed. 

Quick negotiation: Authorities entered an open garage door and closed the door behind them. They remained in the firehouse for about 15 minutes before emerging with the suspect
