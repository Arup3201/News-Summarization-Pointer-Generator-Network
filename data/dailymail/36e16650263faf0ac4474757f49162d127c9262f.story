Lifetime has announced a new reality TV show which will follow the escapades of soon-to-be nuns, entitled The Sisterhood.

The unscripted series will sneak behind the doors of a Catholic convent and delve into the lives of five woman with a big decision to make: whether or not to fully commit themselves to God.

The wannabe nuns will live and work in the convent as they take part in what is traditionally the first step in entering this religious order, the 'discernment phase.'

Over six hour-long episodes, where the hopeful 'servants of God' will live according to the vows of  chastity, poverty and obedience, each woman will undergo a program which will 'truly test their devotion.'

Already, the premise of the show is skirting the lines of 'reality', as women don't usually live in a convent during this phase.

Once they have opened their minds to the possibility of joining the sisterhood, as it exists in the real world, a young woman will traditionally spend her discernment phase - amid her usual setting - pondering the pros and cons of forgoing single or married life.

Next she transitions into the 'postulancy' phase, which is a six month test period in which she will live according to the requirements of a nun, to see if the lifestyle truly appeals.

Only then will she be accepted to live in a convent for one to two years, without taking vows, until she is finally absolutely certain that she is ready to live an ordained life - at which point she is permitted to take her vows.

Of course, in the land of Lifetime - which is hiring the same producers who bought us the questionable 'reality' show, Breaking Amish - the standard process is 'accelerated', according to the network.

Lifetime and collaborator Hot Snakes Media are in the process of finalizing the convent and location for The Sisterhood, and a premiere date has not yet been determined.
