Bob Geldof has spoken publicly for the first time since the death of his daughter Peaches - to address the plight of the Nigerian schoolgirls taken hostage by terrorists.

The Live Aid campaigner told Channel 5 news that he hoped the girls could be returned to their parents - but added that a celebrity campaign currently flooding social media with posts 
using the hashtag: #BringBackOurGirls, was unlikely to help.

Michelle
 Obama, Malala Yousafzai, Hillary Clinton, and Amy Poehler are among 
those lending their support to the social media campaign, which 
encourages military intervention to recover the girls who were kidnapped
 from their school by Boko Haram rebels in north-east Nigeria.

But Bob said while people are keen to help, proper counter-terrorism measures now need to be employed.

He said: 'The problem with media like this, is that everyone wants to do something, but sometimes you just can't. There is a great feeling of frustration.

'The U.S., the UK and several EU states, the Russians - they know about counter terrorism.

'If there is someone out there who could help – maybe some sort of technological bounty I don’t know- but it will not stop the problem, it may find the girls and hopefully they are alive and could be reunited with their parents, but it won’t stop the problem.'

TV presenter Peaches died aged 25, last month.

The mother-of-two was discovered at her home in Wrotham, Kent and in an echo of her mother Paula Yates's 2000 overdose, it is believed heroin played a role in her death.

The inquest opened in Gravesend, Kent, but after a short statement by the police, was adjourned until July.

Bob spoke in a pre-arranged speech to a selected audience just hours after Peaches' death - but this is the first time he has addressed the wider world since the tragedy.

Malala
 Yousafzai told CNN that the kidnapped girls were her 'sisters'. 
Angelina Jolie also spoke publicly about the kidnapping, which she 
called 'unthinkable cruelty and evil'.

Michelle
 Obama shared a photograph on Twitter of herself holding up a sign 
reading 'Bring back our girls', accompanied by the caption: 'Our prayers
 are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to 
#BringBackOurGirls. -mo'

The sign-off 'mo' means that the tweet was written by the First Lady herself and not a staffer.

Michelle Obama shared this photo of herself along with the caption 'Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families.'

Hilary Clinton was among those who tweeted in support of the campaign, which encourages military intervention to recover the girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram rebels on April 14

The campaign refers to the kidnapping of 276 girls from their school in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, on April 14.

The
 Islamist militant group Boko Haram attacked the school, which had been 
reopened so that students could take their final exams, despite security
 concerns.

Most 
schools in the state had closed due to fear that Boko Haram, which 
opposes 'Western' education, including the education of girls, would 
attack.

On
 the night of April 14, more than 300 girls were kidnapped at gunpoint, 
but approximately 50 girls escaped by jumping off the back of the trucks
 as they drove into the Sambisa forest.

Family
 members of the kidnapped girls formed makeshift search parties and 
ventured into the forest to find the girls, armed with homemade weapons,
 but they have not found the girls, whom they now fear have been sold 
into slavery. 

Militant:
 The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, vows to sell the hundreds of
 schoolgirls kidnapped in northern Nigeria for as little as £7 during a 
video message

It has also emerged that the group had 
kidnapped another 11 girls from the village of Warabe in Borno yesterday, 
increasing the international pressure for the extremist group to be stopped and the girls returned.

Nigerian Police are now offering a £300,000 reward to anyone who can help them find the missing children.

Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram said he would sell the remaining captives as slaves for as little as £7.

In a video, Shekau declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.'
