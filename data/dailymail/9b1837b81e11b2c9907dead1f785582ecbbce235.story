A four-year-old girl has become a Hollywood star on the day she starts school for the first time.

Little Olivia Konten-Sloman landed a starring role in the new Richard Curtis romantic comedy About Time, which opens today.

However, Olivia had more important things to worry about than glittering premieres and autograph-hunters - she went to 'big school' for the first time on Tuesday.

Olivia Konten-Sloman from Barry in South Wales became a Hollywood star on the first day of school after staring in the new Richard Curtis film 'About Time'

Flame-haired Olivia is appearing at cinemas across the country alongside Hollywood stars Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy.

But she won’t be able to see the film herself - because she is too young to view a 12A-rated movie.

Proud parents Jenny and Lloyd told how Olivia landed the part just two weeks after joining a children’s model agency.

Jenny, 32, said: 'We get a lot of compliments about Olivia’s hair and how pretty she is so we enrolled her with a model agency.

'Two weeks later she got called for an audition in London in front of Richard Curtis.

'Olivia was only about two-and-three-quarters at the time and she sang Richard a little song - There’s a Worm at the Bottom of the Garden - she had learned at baby ballet.

Olivia was more excited by her first day at All Saints Church in Wales School in her home town of Barry, South Wales, than appearing in a major blockbuster

'They liked her striking features, the red hair and her tan skin.

'We were thrilled when she got the part but we didn’t realise how big the film was going to be.'

But
Olivia was more excited by her first day at All Saints Church in Wales 
School in her home town of Barry, South Wales, than appearing in a major
blockbuster.

She was dressed in her new school clothes and with her pink rucksack ready for the school run at 8am.

Despite being a member of the cast, Olivia will be unable to watch the film she appears in as About Time is rated 12A

Jenny said: 'She was first to go in to school and was very excited.

'There were no tears from her at the school gates - I was the one crying!'

About Time, written and directed by Curtis, stars Bill Nighy, Rachel McAdams and Domnhall Gleeson.

Olivia took to being on set and meeting Hollywood stars like a professional

Little Olivia spent two weeks filming alongside the Hollywood stars and was given her own trailer.

There
is a lot of waiting around on a film set but Olivia coped with the long
hours like a professional - even when one of the leading actors kept 
getting their lines wrong.

Teacher Jenny said: 'Rachel was lovely and spent time chatting with Olivia - she was very caring and aware she was working such a little girl.

'Anyone else would have been daunted but because she is so young Olivia took it all in her stride.'

The film is goes on general release across the UK today but parents Jenny and Lloyd said Olivia won’t see the film until it comes out on DVD.

Jenny said: 'Lloyd and I are going to see the film on the first night but Olivia will be with the babysitter because some of the scenes aren’t appropriate for a four-year-old.

'We will show her the parts she is in when the DVD comes out.

'We have told Olivia she is going to be on the TV and famous but I’m not sure she really understands.'

The proud parents said Olivia enjoyed acting in the film but it is too early to say whether she will continue her film career.

Lloyd said: 'When she was doing the filming, she seemed to enjoy it and was keen to do more.

'We are not pushy parents, but just want to be supportive.'
