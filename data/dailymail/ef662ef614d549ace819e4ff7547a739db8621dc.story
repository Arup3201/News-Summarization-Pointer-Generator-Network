Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is having an easier time of it on this year's X Factor so far - and she's got one woman to thank, Sarah-Jane Crawford.

The TV presenter, who is starting her first term on the ITV talent show has become the latest punching bag for the programme's boss, Simon Cowell. 

The stars have spent the last few weeks together scouring the country for new talent at auditions and Simon has been winding down during breaks from filming... by winding Sarah-Jane up.

Sarah-Jane, 29, said: 'He clocked it immediately - I'm very similar to Cheryl in the sense that it really doesn't take much to wind me up.

'He loves to joke around.  

'That's the reason he goes for her too - it doesn't take much to get a reaction. 

'My funniest point so far has been when he was pressing my buttons by telling me that even his two dogs Squiddly and Diddly were more popular than me with the general public.

'He did a test by putting a shout out to me on Twitter to all of his followers.

'Then he immediately put a photo of his two dogs  on there and said we'd judge how popular we both were by how many responses they got.

'After a couple of hours when I next bumped into him, he was like, 'So my dogs got this many thousands of favourites and re-tweets, and you got just this many, hmmmmm.'

'It's all good fun though, he has got a great sense of humour and he doesn't mind you joking around back. 

'I also get teased over my boyfriend because I'm punching above my weight, the rest of the crew enjoy that one.

'Ross (Hardland) has come down onto set a few times and they love him on there, they like to try and wind me up by saying that he's way too good looking for me.

'It's just like a big family there, everyone teases each other and just messes around, but at the same time they are incredibly professional, it's amazing how hard everyone works.' 

Sarah-Jane has a busy few days ahead of her - as well as preparing for the first X Factor show this weekend, she has to record her BBC Radio 1Xtra show.

She is also the face of the new Coppafeel! campaign manithon that is taking place all of today in the capital. 

 

Simon Cowell regularly posts pictures of his two dogs Diddly and Squiddly on Twitter 

20 manicure stations have been set up by Birchbox, in partnership with Models Own nail polish, in London's Soho Square. 

A team of therapists are offering express manicures to the public from 10am-7.30pm - cash goes toward the Coppafeel! charity. 

And despite having barely enough time to breathe right now, Sarah-Jane signed up to front the event because the cause is close to her heart after being on the end of a breast cancer scare earlier this year when she found a lump in her breast.

Fortunately, it turned out to be benign and after an operation to remove it, she is in good health.

But it gave her a scare and made her realise the importance of regular breast checks.

She said: 'I would never have even noticed it if I hadn't been asked to pose up checking my boobs for the Coppafeel campaign's Check Em Tuesday - I did that and then I found the lump.

'After tests and an operation, I am now fine and very lucky that it wasn't something more serious, but I want to show girls how important this issue is.

'The week I found that lump was one of the most emotionally strained ever because in the same three days I found it, I also went to go and see Simon Cowell to have my first chat about this X Factor job.

'My mum and I were just talking last night about how crazy it is that all happened only a few months ago, now that everything has worked out ok.

'But it just goes to show how important it is to check for lumps - I would never have done it otherwise and if it had been more serious, it could have been much worse for me right now.'
