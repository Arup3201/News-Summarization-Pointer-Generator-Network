Cesc Fabregas looked ice cool on Monday night when the midfielder starred on his Chelsea debut in the Blues' 3-1 win at Burnley in their Premier League opener.

But the £30million summer arrival from Barcelona didn't look quite as comfortable when ice cool water was dumped over his head as the Spain international became the latest star to complete the ice bucket challenge.

Chelsea team-mate Didier Drogba also took part in the challenge, but looked the more composed of the Blues stars upon completing the challenge.

Time to nominate: Didier Drogba made his nominations before taking the ice bucket challenge

Soaked: Drogba was nominated by many before taking the challenge

Just done it: The Chelsea striker leaped to his feet having completed the challenge

Among those who nominated Fabregas were former Barca team-mate Gerard Pique and current Blues star Andre Schurrle, while Drogba's nominations have been so plentiful he couldn't single anyone out.

Both Chelsea stars have upped the stakes with their nominations, with Fabregas electing Thierry Henry and David Villa, while Drogba boldly selected Blues boss Jose Mourinho and Blues team doctor Eva Carneiro.

The ice bucket challenge, which has become social media's latest craze is designed to raise money and awareness for the neurodegenerative illness ALS - better known as Lou Gehrig's disease
