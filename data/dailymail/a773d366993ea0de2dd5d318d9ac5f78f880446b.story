Surgery tourists: Almost a third of Brits having cosmetic surgery are opting to go under the knife abroad

A third of Brits who opt for cosmetic surgery such as boob jobs and face lifts now travel abroad to get it done on the cheap, according to a new study.

The research suggests we have become a nation of cosmetic surgery tourists, with many seeking lower-cost elective procedures in Eastern Europe.

But, worryingly, more than half are unhappy with the results and one in five had to have further treatment back in Britain to correct problems.

The Czech Republic is the country of choice for breast enlargements with 19 per cent of women choosing to go there.

Meanwhile, almost one in five lip fillers and nose jobs are also carried out in the country.

Others travel even further afield with the research by Confused.com finding Thailand is extremely popular among Brits seeking teeth-whitening procedures.

More than a quarter of those getting their teeth done abroad (28 per cent) head for the south-east Asian country.

Switzerland was found to be the top destination for face-lifts (29 per cent), botox (28 per cent) and liposuction (14 per cent).

The price comparison website discovered 30 per cent who have had cosmetic procedures travelled abroad.

The main factor is the cheaper cost of surgery in other countries.

A quarter (25 per cent) said they went overseas because they couldnâ€™t afford to have the procedure done in the UK.

Others claim they opted for surgery abroad so they could combine it with a holiday at the same time (20 per cent).

But it seems it may be a false economy with a greater risk of botched operations.

Less than half were pleased with the results (46 per cent), and only 15 per cent would recommend others do the same.

One in five who opted for a foreign cosmetic procedure (19 per cent) had to have further treatments to correct a problem, compared to just 6 per cent who stayed in the UK.

It seems other complications are more likely to affect those who go under the knife abroad, according to the survey of 1,559 cosmetic surgery patients.

A third claim to have caught an infection (33 per cent), whereas only 9 per cent say this happened after a procedure in the UK.

Many flock to overseas clinics they know have been visited by celebrities.

The study found one in ten (10 per cent) chose a clinic or surgeon because it had been used by a star.

A similar number (11 per cent) opted to use somewhere recommended by friends or family.

Despite the apparently heightened risks of heading abroad for procedures, only 14 per cent notified their doctor before travelling.

Confused.com advise those travelling abroad for medical treatment should ensure they are adequately protected should the worst happen.

Yet only a third (33 per cent) took out travel insurance, with even fewer notifying their existing insurer (29 per cent) of their plans.

Mhairi Edwards, Head of Travel Insurance at Confused.com said: 'Our research suggests cosmetic surgery tourism is now a popular trend among Brits.

'If consumers are tempted by a nip and tuck or a brighter smile at a smaller cost, we urge them to do their homework so their bargain treatment does not prove to be a costly mistake.

'Potential patients go overseas where prices are lower and procedures are more readily accessible.

'However, it is clear there are increased risks associated with travelling abroad for cosmetic procedures.

'Those considering surgery or procedures abroad should ensure they are fully protected, because they could be left in the lurch if things go wrong.

'Notifying your doctor and ensuring you have adequate travel insurance is a must.

'Travellers should also be aware normal travel insurance might not cover them for all procedures abroad, so they need to be thorough when choosing the right policy for them.'
