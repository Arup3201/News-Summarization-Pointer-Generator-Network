Lord Hope resigned amid allegations he helped cover up the behaviour of paedophile Robert Waddington 

A leading Church of England prelate quit his post as a bishop yesterday, a week after being accused of covering up for a paedophile priest.

Former Archbishop of York Lord Hope surrendered his position as a bishop in the Diocese of Bradford after a judge found he had protected the Very Reverend Robert Waddington from exposure, investigation and prosecution.

But while stepping down, Lord Hope – who covered up for the sex abuser cleric while serving as number two in the hierarchy of the church – stopped short of apologising for the priests’s actions.

He said in a statement: ‘After much prayerful and considered thought I wrote at the beginning of the week to the Bishop of Leeds and in the light of the Cahill Inquiry report I have submitted my resignation as Honorary Assistant Bishop of Bradford, now West Yorkshire and the Dales, with immediate effect.

‘This ends my nearly 50 years of formal ministry in the Church of England, which I have always sought to serve with dedication. 

'I will certainly continue to pray for the important ongoing work with survivors.’

Lord Hope’s position as a bishop in Bradford came into question following publication of an inquiry report last week in which Judge Sally Cahill found that ‘because of the actions he took, and his inaction on other occasions, opportunities were missed for an investigation which may have led to a prosecution during Robert Waddington’s lifetime’,

The judge’s report added: ‘His concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount in his response to these allegations.’

Last week Lord Hope, who served as Archbishop of York from 1995 to 2005, greeted the publication of Judge Cahill’s report by calling it ‘flawed’ and a ‘disappointment’ and offering only qualified regret for the Waddington cover-up.

The report found that Waddington, who rose to become Dean of Manchester, in charge of the city’s cathedral, was a lifelong paedophile who had attracted complaints in every decade from the 1950s. 

It suggested the suicide in 1989 of a former Carlisle choirboy may have been connected to abuse by Waddington in the 1970s, and it said a complaint laid against Waddington by Manchester Cathedral’s organist in 1989 was ignored.

In 1999 an Australian bishop reported to Lord Hope complaints of abuse by Waddington in Australia during the 1960s. 

Lord Hope reported back that Waddington, by then retired in York, was desperately ill with cancer, lived a ‘hermit-like’ existence, and it was impossible that he could pose a threat to any child.

He also told Waddington about the allegations in a face-to-face meeting and declined to involve police.

But at the time, the judge found, Waddington was regularly taking services in York Minster and had access to rooms used by choirboys. Witnesses to the inquiry said he had been seen putting a chocolate bar into one choirboy’s pocket and had invited another boy to his home.

The report listed seven breaches of church safeguarding rules by Lord Hope in 1999, five in 2003 and six in 2004.

In 2013 the Waddington affair was thrown into the open when former Manchester choirboy Eli Ward gave detailed evidence of the abuse he had suffered. However Waddington died in 2007, his reputation intact.

The present Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, said yesterday: ‘I respect the prayerful decision made by my predecessor Lord David Hope. I am deeply saddened by his decision.

‘It did not come as a surprise to me when on the day the inquiry report was published Lord Hope said that “it is matter of great regret to me that 12 years ago when the non-specific anonymous allegations were first made in Manchester, the church and I myself were not more proactive in seeking out and/or assisting a reluctant complainant. Nor is it any comfort that other organisations were no more diligent at that time when dealing with similar situations”.’

Archbishop Sentamu added: ‘As the old saying goes “to err is human, to forgive is divine”.

‘The Inquiry into the alleged abuses by Robert Waddington led by Judge Sally Cahill has made its recommendations and these now need to be considered and action taken in a thoughtful and measured manner to ensure the church can be a safer place for all,’ Dr Sentamu said.
