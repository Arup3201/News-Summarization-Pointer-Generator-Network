Several Texans have become ill during the recent outbreak of a previously rare parasitic infection.

Over 40 people in four north Texas counties have become ill after falling victim to the food-borne Cyclospora parasite, leaving them with a myriad of symptoms that can last for months if untreated. Infections have risen steadily in the state over the past few years, according to reports.

Health officials have told local media they believe the parasite has been caught by people eating fresh produce.

Explaining that the parasite is endemic to tropical or sub-tropical fruit, Dr. Peggy White, chief epidemiologist for Collin County (TX.), told the Dallas Morning News that ‘it could be coming in from fruit that was brought in from a tropical or subtropical region.’

Transmitted through raw fruit and vegetables, the cyclospora parasite causes serious gastrointestinal discomfort including ‘watery diarrhea, frequent and sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, and bloating, according to the paper. If infected, the problem is treated with antibiotics.

Cyclospora leaves its droppings on fruits and vegetables, but simply rinsing the fruit isn’t enough, according to reports. Local health officials are recommending people scrub their produce and rinse it multiple times in order to avoid infection.

Sometimes we all do something closer to a rinse,” Vanessa Joseph, public health spokesperson for Tarrant County (TX.) told the paper, “but we really need to wash.”

Incidences of cyclospora have been on 
the rise across Texas in the past few years. Reported cases have risen 
from nine in 2010, to 14 in 2011 and 44 last year, according to NBC Dallas.
With 42 infections from this outbreak alone, according to the paper,  
the state is on pace to top the previous year’s infection rate for at 
least the third year in a row.

Making it even more difficult to treat, experts told the station, is that tests to detect the parasite are not 100 percent accurate.

With another cyclospora outbreak raging across Iowa and Nebraska, Texas health officials are trying to determine if the two are linked, according to reports. Over 100 people have fallen victim to that outbreak.
