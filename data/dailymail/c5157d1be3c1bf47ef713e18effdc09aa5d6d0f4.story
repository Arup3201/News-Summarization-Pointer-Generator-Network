A family's Los Angeles home has been hit by four cars in the space of just two years - and a crash on Easter Sunday nearly struck their baby's crib.

Jeff Sauerwein is demanding the city of Highland take action to stop speeding drivers on his street after the fourth car slammed through the side of his property around 4a.m. Sunday.

The most recent incident was the worst so far and involved a suspected drunk driver. Mr Sauerwein says he, his wife, their son and 11-month-old daughter woke up to a loud boom when the car crashed into their home, which lies in front of a 90-degree turn.

'That car 
went through my house,' Mr Sauerwein told KTLA. 'It went through my 
garage... and hit my house five feet below my baby's crib.'

The family ran outside and called 911. they initially thought an earthquake had caused the house to shake.

'All of a sudden I see the driver of the car got out, ran around the back of my house and then hopped a wall on the other side of my house to take off running,' the homeowner told CBS LA.

San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrested Jaysean Kornegeay on suspicion of drunk driving, the TV station reported.

Mr Sauerwein said the crash caused a gas
 leak and a flood on the ground floor of the home, rendering it 
uninhabitable. He says the family is staying nearby while repairs are 
carried out.

'There's just a cloud of dust and debris. The whole wall's caved in under my car,' he said. 'They basically red-tagged it because there's no gas. There's no water. My whole first floor's flooded.'

Mr Sauerwein's 6-year-old son Tristan said he was shaken up when the car collided with his home.

'I had tears going down my eyes,' he told KTLA.

'I thought the house was going to explode.'

Other cars: The father said that over the past two years, three other vehicles have ended up on their property including the one above

Dangerous spot: One vehicle hit a fence; one landed in the bushes and another left skid marks on the sidewalk, he told KTLA

The family said they have repeatedly asked city officials for a sign warning of the sharp turn ahead on the dead end road, but so far they said nothing has been done.

'What's it gonna take? For a car to hit my house or someone to die? Well, last Sunday someone hit my house. Thank God no one died,' Mr Sauerwein told CBS.
