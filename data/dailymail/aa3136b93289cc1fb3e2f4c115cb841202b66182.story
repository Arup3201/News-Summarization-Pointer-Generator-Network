The daughter of a West Virginia sheriff gunned down while sitting in his patrol car believes there's a 'strong possibility' he was killed because of his dedicated fight against drugs.

Mingo County Sheriff Walter Crum took office only three months before he was shot at point-blank range on Wednesday while eating lunch in his marked vehicle.

'My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,' his daughter, Julie Hall, told CNN on Saturday.

Motive: Julie Hall, the daughter of slain Mingo County Sheriff Walter E Crum has revealed her suspected belief that he was killed because of his active fight against illegal drug trading

Targeted: Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum was gunned down where he usually parked and ate lunch in Williamson, West Virginia leading many to suspect it was a targeted attack

Crum had a reputation for targeting drug dealers, a campaign promise those who knew him say he worked to uphold.

Police say 37-year-old Tennis Melvin Maynard shot Crum while he was parked in a place he usually took his lunches.

It was a witness' 911 call offering Maynard's license plate number that rushed a sheriff's deputy to the scene.

After a high-speed chase, the suspect crashed his SUV.

When he got out and pulled a handgun, the deputy fired, leading to the suspect's hospitalization.

Because he is heavily medicated authorities say his statements have remained inconsistent.

Authorities have yet to release a motive for the slaying. They say the handgun used against Crum was confirmed as the one found in Maynard’s possession.

'Things are still under investigation at this time. We really are unsure,' Crum's daughter said in her first interview since her father's death.

But she says it's a gut feeling that leads her to believe he was killed because of his dedicated public service.

The family of Maynard aren't so sure.

His mother, Olgie Maynard, told CNN her son has spent time in a state hospital for mental health issues in recent years.

She says he was never physical or violent.

'He talks a lot to himself,' she explained of his behavior.

Melvin Maynard, the father of Tennis 
Maynard, said it was an explosion in an Alabama coal mine that 
exposed to chemicals  that led to his deteriorating mental state.

The elder Maynard would not elaborate
on what kind of mental health problems his son had, although according 
to a pending lawsuit he was injured in a 2007 explosion caused by a 
lightning strike at his work.

His father says he 
believes his son would have shot the first person he saw and Crum's death was not targeted.

'I know he should have been in a hospital,' Melvin said, adding that his son had previously been in an institution.

Rosie Crum was sworn into office on Thursday to finish the remainder of her husband's job after county officials agreed she was the best person to continue his legacy of fighting the scourge of prescription pill abuse.

Dozens of mourners turned out to pay their respects to Sheriff Crum on Thursday.

The Williamson Daily News reports that County Commissioner John Mark Hubbard said: 'After much thought and prayer, the three of us have come to believe that the best plan to fulfill this obligation is with the person who knew Eugene the best. The person who knew his stand on crime and drugs, who knew his plans for Mingo County and who was his best friend and soulmate.

'My recommendation is that we appoint Eugene’s widow, Rosie Crum, to fill his position.'

Rosie Crum has no law enforcement experience, though county residents said the sheriff is usually a 'politician-type,' who wasn't already a police

Mourning: Deputies sobbed as they honors their slain leader at a town memorial service on Thursday

Tragedy: Crum died from his injuries at the scene after leading a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance as part of a campaign pledge

Sheriff Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, said Delegate Harry Keith White, who 
campaigned with Crum last year.

He said his friend was shot to death where he regularly parked his patrol vehicle to eat lunch, near the 
site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills.

'I think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,' White said. 'It's just a sad, sad day for Mingo County and the state of West Virginia.'

The suspect, who was shot by a deputy, was taken to a hospital in Logan, said Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's chief of staff Rob Alsop said.

Promises: Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge last year, he's seen while being sworn in

The suspect wrecked his vehicle while
attempting to flee the scene and was shot after he was seen raising his
weapon, Capt Dave Nelson of the West Virginia State Patrol told CNN.

The
courthouse was immediately evacuated, streets into the city were 
blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, 
Crum's body further shielded by two vehicles.

The shooting occurred within a block of the county courthouse, said Office of Emergency Services head dispatcher Willis Spence.

Crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, White said. He won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall.

Crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in Delbarton.

White said Crum was dedicated to improving the community and devoted to his grandchildren and adult children.

'He always had family around him,' he said.

After dozens of indictments were issued earlier this year, Prosecutor Michael Sparks issued a press release declaring that Crum 'exceeded my highest expectations' and 'has provided a game changing boost to our drug enforcement program.'

Delegate Justin Marcum, D-Mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called Crum 'a true friend to the county.'

'He'll be dearly missed,' he said.

Williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the Tug Fork River in a part of the state long associated with violence. Mingo and neighboring McDowell County are home to the legendary blood feud between the Hatfield family of West Virginia and the McCoy family of Kentucky, a conflict dating to the Civil War.

Crum's county was dubbed 'Bloody Mingo' during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled Baldwin-Felts security agents hired by the coal operators.

In May 1920, after evicting striking miners in Red Jacket, some of the Baldwin-Felts men tried to board a train in nearby Matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, Sid Hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the Hatfields in the feud.

After a gun battle recreated in the 1987 John Sayles film 'Matewan,' the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. Hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in Matewan.

Though there is no indication of a direct connection, Crum's killing comes on the heels of a Texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. Those killings happened a couple of months after 1 of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office.

Colorado's corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Two days later, Evan Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected of shooting Clements, died in a shootout about 100 miles from Kaufman.

On Monday, judicial officials acknowledged Ebel was freed four years early because of a paperwork error.

U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin called Crum's killing 'shocking' and said he's spoken to the State Police, which will lead the investigation. He pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed.

Over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the National District Attorneys Association. At least 8 of them were targeted in the line of duty.

The Officer Down Memorial Page says 197 police officers in West Virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from deliberate gunfire.
