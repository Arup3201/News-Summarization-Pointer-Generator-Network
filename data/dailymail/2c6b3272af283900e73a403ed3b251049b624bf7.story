An 11-year-old girl scared off a burglar who broke into her Michigan house while she was home alone by pointing her own shotgun directly at him.

The girl hid in her bathroom closet after she heard two intruders - James Wasson, 53, and Rhonda Steward, 31 - enter the residence around 3pm on January 30, and grabbed the firearm, which was stored in a gun safe.

When Wasson opened the closet door and found himself staring down the barrel of the 12-gauge, he ran off and both burglars fled, MLive.com reported.

Lapeer County Sheriff Detective Sgt. Jason Parks called the girl a 'protector of her home' and said she was responsible and calm during the break-in last week.

'She was able to defend herself from an intruder and resolve an event even most adults would be taken aback by.'

Parks said the shotgun belonged to the girl and that she was 'familiar' with it, as she uses it often to go hunting with her father. 

He added that the girl, whose parents had not yet returned home from work, showed she was capable of 'making sound, good decisions' and had demonstrated she was more than able to stay home by herself.

Wasson, 53, and Steward, 31, from Detroit, were arrested in a nearby city shortly after the home invasion.

Police believe they are connected to between 25 and 50 similar break-ins.

Wasson is charged with home invasion, burglary tool possession, receiving and concealing stolen property, felon in possession of a firearm and firearm used in commission of a felony.

Steward is charged with home invasion and burglary tool possession.

Both remain in custody at the Lapeer County Jail.
