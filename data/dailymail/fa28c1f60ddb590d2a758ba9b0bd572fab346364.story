The son of a Broadway veteran was caught shoplifting from a Manhattan drug store early Thursday. His loot of choice: toothbrushes and toothpaste.

Ben Vereen Jr. is also alleged to have snagged some cellphone charges in the strange early morning crime at an Upper West Side CVS, reports Page Six.

His namesake father is 68-year-old Tony winning actor Ben Vereen.

According to Page Six, police say Vereen Jr. stole the items in the CVS store on 87th Street and Amsterdam Avenue around 5:30am.

The son of Tony-winning actor Ben Vereen (who is pictured here) was arrested early Thursday after allegedly trying to shoplift toothbrushes and toothpaste from a Manhattan CVS store, Page Six is reporting

He allegedly put up a fight when a store security guard tried putting a stop to his antics.

Page Six reports:

'He wouldn’t give up without a fight and tussled with the guard before cops took him into custody, the sources said.' 

A call put in to Manhattan's 20th precinct police was not immediately returned.

Ben Vereen Sr., who'd yet to speak out on the Page Six report Thursday afternoon, won Tony in 1972 for his performance in Broadway's Pippin.

He's also became well known for his  portrayal of Chicken George in 1977s classic mini-series Roots.

Along with his many other professional accomplishments, Vereen has had personal setbacks.

He and then-wife Andrea Townsley lost their 16-year-old daughter Naja in a tragic New Jersey car crash in 1987.

He subsequently fell into a serious cocaine addiction. He managed to kick the habit in a rehab stint.

However, just after his release Vereen was nearly killed when he was hit by a car while walking alongside the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.

His injuries forced him into months of physical rehabilitation.

Despite all that, Vereen made a career comeback in the 1990s. Just this October, he starred alongside Jena Malone and Richard Gere in the drama Time Out of Mind.
