Alarm: The BBC has issued a security warning after a TV worker was attacked by a gang outside the hotel where Gary Lineker (pictured) is staying

The BBC has issued an urgent security warning to its World Cup staff in Rio de Janeiro after four youths tried to mug a TV worker outside the hotel where Gary Lineker is staying.

The victim, described as a ‘consultant’, was surrounded by the gang three minutes after leaving the ITV studios on Copacabana Beach, but bravely fought them off after a scuffle.

It happened as he passed the gates of Girl From Ipanema park, named after the famous song, at 7pm last Sunday.

Then, on the opening night of the tournament on Thursday, the ITV studios were pelted with rocks during a protest.

Two demonstrators arrested were reportedly carrying explosive devices.

The incidents have prompted the BBC and ITV to take extra measures to ensure safety of staff. Both broadcasters are understood to have hired private security firms.

Lineker posted a photograph on Twitter of riot police lined up outside the BBC studios, writing: ‘Best defence on show this evening, right outside.’

Lineker, who is anchoring the Corporation’s coverage in Brazil, broadcasts from the studio above ITV’s and, along with the rest of his team, was told about the mugging when he arrived in Rio the day after it happened.

The BBC is concerned because the 
attack happened just yards from the four-star Arpoador Inn, where the 
pundit and former England captain is staying along with the rest of his 
broadcast team.

In an email 
to staff, the BBC said: ‘Youths attempted to steal the bag of  a 
consultant working for ITV this evening. He was surrounded by four young
 males who attempted to grab his bag from his back.

‘They were unsuccessful and quickly fled the scene.’

Accompanying the email was a map ‘showing the Arpoador’s location in relation to the park’.

The email warns: ‘After dark, staff should avoid walking back to the hotel alone, especially if carrying kit.X

‘As mentioned previously, don’t wear or carry anything on your person that isn’t essential to your work/tasks for the day.

While World Cup players have been  trying to acclimatise to the sweltering temperatures in Brazil, a group of  Miss Belgium contestants found a  novel way to deal with the heat in  their own country – by playing a  match in their bras.

The French speakers took on those who  speak Flemish in a match  in the town  of Waregem.

'Walking through the park at any time 
should be avoided if carrying kit/valuables, and staff should consider 
it off-limits after dark.’

The park leads to Copacabana beach and is  popular with tourists, who are regularly targeted by criminals.

It is close to the spot where the real Girl From Ipanema was spotted by Brazilian songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim and poet Vinicius de Moraes as they sat outside the Veloso cafe in 1962.

The song they wrote about the girl, 19-year-old Heloisa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto, became a worldwide hit.

With protests by Brazilians angered by the cost of hosting the World Cup continuing across the country, security is becoming a major issue.

The government is spending £509  million on policing.

As well as 150,000 troops and police officers on duty, more than 2,000 private security companies are protecting officials, VIPs and media organisations.
