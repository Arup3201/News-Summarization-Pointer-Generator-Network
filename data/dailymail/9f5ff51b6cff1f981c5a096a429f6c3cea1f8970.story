The number of pets being abandoned has risen by 65 per cent as owners struggle to afford to look after them, the RSPCA said.

Despite the recession being over, animals are still facing ‘dark times’ as 40,595 animals were abandoned in 2011 compared to 24,638 in 2007.

The charity is also struggling, finding it harder to rehome abandoned pets and responding to more than 25,000 calls a week from the public.

'Dark times': The number of abandoned pets has soared by 65 per cent as owners struggle to afford looking after them and the RSPCA predicts a further 6,000 dogs and cats will be abandoned from now until the end of the year

The charity’s running costs have risen by 8 per cent from £111million to £120million since 2007 as the average cost of a stay for the animals is on the rise and the number of adoptions is at an all-time low.

RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said: ‘The recession may be over but these are very dark times for its silent victims, the animals.

'They have never needed our help so desperately.

‘Preventing cruelty and helping the animals most in need are the RSPCA's absolute priorities but the number of abused and abandoned animals is soaring.’

Costly cats: The RSPCA running costs have risen as they struggled to rehome a growing number of cats and dogs with the average stay for a cat at 59 days, four more days than last year

There has also been a 23.5 per cent rise in cruelty convictions in the past year.

The first nine months of this year alone have seen 1,176 cruelty convictions involving work by the RSPCA, a 6 per cent rise on the same period in 2011, which saw 1,108 convictions.

In crisis: RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said the charity is struggling to cope and is appealing to the public for donations

As the number of animals in need grows, 
welfare expenditure by the RSPCA, which relies entirely on public 
donations, is already exceeding forecasts set for 2012.

Mr Grant said: ‘We have more animal abusers to investigate, prosecute and hopefully prevent from hurting animals than anyone can remember.’

The charity is predicting a further 6,000 dogs and cats will be abandoned between now and the end of the year at a cost of nearly £5m.

The charity said it is finding it harder to rehome abandoned pets, with 12,711 dogs rehomed in 2011, compared with 16,659 in 2009.

In 2011 only 29,880 cats were re-homed, fewer than the 36,070 cats who found new owners two years earlier.

The average stay for a dog in the year so far is 59 days, five more than last year and their average cost of stay has risen from £810 to £885.

Cats have also averaged stays of 59 days this year - four more days than in 2011 - and the average cost of their stay has risen to £554.60 from £517.

Mr Grant today called for emergency help from the nation's animal lovers.

He said: ‘This is a real crisis and despite the immense dedication of our staff and volunteers, we are struggling to cope. 

‘We really need our country's animal lovers to step forward and open their hearts, homes and purses in these extremely difficult times.’
