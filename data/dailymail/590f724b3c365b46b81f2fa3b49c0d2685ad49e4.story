If you happen to live in small-town Williamsfield, Ohio, and have a 44093 zip code, your neighborhood has been ranked America's number one most stressful place to live, based on data from the latest U.S. Census.

Real estate blog Movoto crunched the numbers by assessing factors such as average household earnings, hours worked, commute times, access to health care and amount of disposable income.

Zip codes in Mississippi, California, Alabama and Tennessee were ranked next most-stressful; with certain inner-city zip codes, in New York and Los Angeles for example, deemed least stressful of all.

Taking eight stress-factors into account for every zip code and averaging their scores left the picturesque Williamsfield, Ohio, head-and-shoulders above the rest.

With a small population of 984 people - and 'basically no bars, restaurants or parks' as Movoto points out - inhabitants of this zip code struggle with long working hours and very little pay-off.

Almost 40per cent of locals don't have health insurance, 40per cent of families are below the poverty line, and rent accounts for an average of 50per cent of people's pay checks, despite 42-hour work-weeks being the norm.

The zip code of 38647 in Michigan City, Mississippi came next, again for its long working hours, very low median incomes and average commutes of 45 minutes.

Worlds apart: The zip code of 44093 in Williamsfield, Ohio (left) ranked most stressful, with high poverty - and incidentally no bars - and the snazzy 90058 zip code in Los Angeles, California (right) was ranked lowest

93640 in Mendota, California took the third spot, and has one of the biggest populations in the top ten with 11,600 inhabitants.

It had a headache of stress scores across the board, with standouts being an unemployment rate over 25per cent, over 42per cent of families below the poverty line, and an average work-week of over 42 hours.

36776 in Sawyerville, Alabama came in fourth, with almost 40per cent of locals unemployed. For those who are employed, the work-week is over 40 hours, the commute is 34 minutes, and more than half their pay checks - a household average of $27,000 - goes on rent.

Inhabitants of the 38617 zip code in Coahoma, the second Mississippi zip code to make the top ten, wrestle with 42-minute commutes - the lowest in this category was a swift four minutes in McConnell, Illinois - as well as long working hours and 25per cent of the population without health care

37018 in Beechgrove, Tennessee, and 39743 in Crawford, Mississippi come in next as the sixth and seventh most stressful zip codes to live in; again, with hard-working locals pulling in low incomes and many without health insurance.

At number eight on the list, Houston, Texas, locals with a 77032 zip code work an average of 39 hours per week, endure a 31-minute commute and make less than $22,500 per year -per household, with a staggeringly high 42per cent of them living below the poverty line.

85172 in Stanfield, Arizona, in at number nine, was an area deemed by Movoto as 'particularly problematic in the wealth department.' Half of people's incomes go on rent and their average 45-hour work-week is especially long.

29915 in Daufuskie Island, South Carolina, takes the number ten spot. Despite it being a pretty and historic resort town, unemployment rates are over 27per cent, and for those who do work, it's for an average of 46 hours a week, with a 47-minute commute twice a day. 

As for the least stress-inducing zip codes in the U.S., where overall quality of life is highest, 90058 in Los Angeles, California wins; followed by 86436 in Topock, Arizona, and 39360 in Shubuta, Mississippi.
