Authorities have named a 'person of interest' in the disappearance of a fireman and father-of-two who has been missing for more than 10 days.

Jerry Perdomo, 31, of Orange City, Florida, had driven 1,500 miles to see a friend and was last seen at a house in Jackson, Maine on February 16.

Police spent the weekend searching the rural home, owned by the father of Daniel Porter, 24, whose girlfriend is 25-year-old Cheyanne Nowak.

Porter has now been named as 'a person of interest' in the case. Police believe he and his girlfriend were the last people to see Perdomo.

The pair were tracked down in Connecticut in the past week and interviewed by police before retuning to Maine.

Investigators have impounded three vehicles, including Mr Perdomo's rental car found abandoned in a Wal-Mart car park in Bangor, Maine.

The second was left at a dealership in
Oakland, Maine, after Porter and Nowak bought a car there - and 
the third is a car owned by Porter.

'The connection between Perdomo, Porter and Nowak, we're still trying to piece together,' Stephen McCausland, of the public safety department, said.

Perdomo was reported missing by his wife Tonya. He has a 
10-year-old boy and two-year-old girl.

'Never in a million years would I think 
I'd be hanging up missing posters of my brother,' his sister Skye Ramos 
told ABC News. 'How can you sleep?'

On Monday, Mr Perdomo's wife, a teacher, spoke publicly about the disappearance.

'Danny lived there, but he’s with his girlfriend most of the time. He comes and goes'

She called her husband 'a dedicated dad. He helps people out a lot.'

'He was always doing something for somebody,' Tonya Perdomo said, adding: 'He had friends from all over so it wouldn't be unusual for him to go out of town.'

Authorities
were drilling through ice and snow and diving underwater in wet suits 
near the home in Jackson as they continue searching.

‘We
applaud them for their resources, their efforts and everything that 
they’re doing,’ a fire spokesman told Fox affiliate WOFL.

A woman calling herself 'Lisa' last week 
told a local TV station that the fireman had been staying with her up 
until the night of his disappearance.

She claimed Mr Perdomo had been travelling to Maine from Florida to visit her every month for ten months.

their efforts and everything that they're doing'

She also told WESH that she had only recently found out he was married.

Don Leino, who lives next door to the 
Maine home being searched, told BangorDailyNews that his neighbours are 
'related to half of Waldo County'.

'They just work all week and get crazy
as hell on the weekends,’ Mr Leino said. ‘They party pretty hard, I think. 
But it’s a nice place to live.

'These guys have never caused anybody 
on this road any trouble.'

'Danny lived there (at his father's 
home) but he’s with his girlfriend most of the time, he comes and goes,'
neighbour Joan Leino added to WOFL.

Mr Perdomo was last seen in a black hooded 
top, shorts and black shoes.

Some of Mr Perdomo's firefighter colleagues in Seminole County have travelled up to Maine to help authorities in their search.

'We are moving forward and are going 
to continue placing missing person posters up in areas where he might 
have been,’ a fire spokesman said.
