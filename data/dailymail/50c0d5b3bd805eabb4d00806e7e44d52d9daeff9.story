Lake Superior State University has released its annual List of Words Banished from the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse, and General Uselessness.

The 40th annual list was culled from nominations received mainly from the university's website, according to the LSSU website.  

The list, released Wednesday, includes words like 'bae,' 'foodie,' 'Swag,' and 'cra-cra.'

The 12 words that make up the list are now among the more than 800 entries the list has seen since its creators published the first list in 1976.

According to the university's website, the list is complied by 'word-watchers' who 'target pet peeves from everyday speech as well as from the news, fields of education, technology, advertising, politics and more.' 

And in December, a committee makes the final cut. 

According to the university, 'bae' was one of 2014's top nominees. 

Evie Dunagan from Mannheim, PA defined the term which means 'before anything else' and said 'How stupid! Stop calling your boyfriend 'bae'.' 

James Becker from Holly, MI described the term of affection as a 'dumb, annoying word.'

A phrase that made it on the list is 'skill set,' apparently, people feel there is no need to combine the two words.

'Why use two words when one will do? We already have a perfectly good word in 'skills' (ending with an s, not a z),' Chip Lupo from Columbia, S.C. said on the university's website.

Disappear: This tweet from Bowdeya Tweh illustrates the popular opinion that 'bae' needs to disappear from our vocabulary as we bring in the new year

After many nominations over the years, the word 'swag,' describing the totality of one's style, personality, and demeanor, which has recently fallen out of popularity, finally made the list. 

'The word 'swag' has become a shapeless, meaningless word used in various forms (such as 'swaggy') but with no real depth,' Bailey Anderson from Washington, Iowa said. 

Vocabulary: Though the list is not enforced, the university has once again let society know which words need to be cut from our vocabulary (photographed is a tweet from Nick Sheltrown)

Banished: In this tweet, Erin Monigold expresses her gratitude for the universityplacing 'bae' on its list of banished words

Though the list is not enforced, the university has once again let society know which words needs to disappear from our vocabulary.

However, the new year isn't here yet.

So, don't be 'cra-cra,' grab your 'bae' and get out of this 'polar vortex!'
