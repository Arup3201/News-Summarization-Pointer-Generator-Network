Dame Helen was awarded the accolade for her role in The Audience, which is about the Queen's weekly meetings with her Prime Ministers from Churchill to Cameron

Three critics have quit the judging panel of a high-profile theatre awards after Dame Helen Mirren won the award for Best Actress when a judge changed their vote.

The organisers of the Evening Standard Theatre Awards said Dame Helen won the award when a judge who works for the newspaper revised his vote after a secret ballot placed two other nominees in a dead heat.

The actress won the Natasha Richardson Award for Best Actress at a glittering ceremony last month at the Savoy Hotel in London for her performance in The Audience.

According to The Times, the Evening Standard's theatre critic Henry Hitchings changed his vote which allowed Dame Helen to win.

The shortlist for the award also consisted of Linda Bassett, Lesley Manville, Billie Piper and Kristin Scott Thomas.

Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands, who was also on the judging panel, told The Times nothing illegitimate had taken place and Mr Hitchings changed his vote because his choice, Rosalie Craig, had been removed from the list.

She said: 'In discussion about what was a dead heat, Henry and I decided that we would go for an option that would make Helen Mirren the winner.

'By doing a first and second vote we could balance the two factions with a third option, which is what happened.'

An Evening Standard spokesman told MailOnline: 'The judging for the Evening Standard Theatre awards was conducted properly. 

'The transferable vote is a perfectly legitimate and long standing element of judging.

'One judge’s first choice in the category in question was a winner in a different category; therefore his second choice became his first vote.

'The result of the transferred vote, without a clear winner in the category, gave us our best actress.'

According to The Times, the three 
judges to have left the panel are Charles Spencer, theatre critic for 
The Telegraph, Georgina Brown, of The Mail on Sunday, and Susannah 
Clapp, of The Observer.

It has been reported one of the outgoing critics alleged one of the awards 'seemed like a fix'.

Libby
Purves, former chief theatre critic of The Times, and the International
Herald Tribune's Matt Wolf are believed to have stayed on.

Dame
Helen was awarded the accolade for her role in The Audience, which is 
about the Queen's weekly meetings with her Prime Ministers from 
Churchill to Cameron.

The
actress has won an array of awards, including an Oscar and a Bafta, for
her portrayal of Elizabeth II in Stephen Frears film The Queen.

The Observer's Susannah Clapp was also reported to have been one of the judges who quit the panel

But she was not the only dame being celebrated on the night of the awards.

Maggie Smith was given the Standard's Icon Award for her contribution to the world stage.

Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kevin Spacey were also presented with special honours at the ceremony.
