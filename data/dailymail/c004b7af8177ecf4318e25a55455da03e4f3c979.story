The mother-of-three said: 'He said to me "I thought I was going to die, I thought I was gone". 

'He will have a permanent scar from his eyebrow to his nose and we don't know about skin grafts yet.

'He's going to have to live with this for the rest of his life and the children will have to see it too.

'He was an absolute mess. I have never seen anything like it in my entire life. It proper shocked me.

'I could hear him shouting "get the dogs off my face". The dogs had got hold of his knee in a locked jaw.

'That's when my girls came out and I quickly got them inside. I was very concerned the dogs would go for them. I was quite hysterical at this point.

'I phoned my mum straight away screaming for them to help me and the kids. We just can't comprehend everything that's happened.'

Mrs Chawick, who has been together with her husband for 18 years and married for eight years, said he will remain in hospital for the next 48 hours to check and prevent infection and could need future cosmetic surgery.

She said: 'He's out of surgery and was in there for about four hours last night with the face and orthopedic surgeons. The facial injury goes from the top of his eyebrow down to his nose.

'Because it is so close to his eyelid they can't do much more. He will probably have a droopy eye.

'He has not been able to walk since this happened as he's had physiotherapy today to help him to walk on crutches. His knee is really swollen and he can't put any weight on it at all.

'There is no actual muscle or tissue damage so he is extremely lucky there.

'The doctors and surgeons said, even though we don't feel it, he is very lucky. It's just been an absolute nightmare.'

Mr Chadwick owns a Staffordshire bull terrier himself and is said to be unhappy that the dogs that attacked him will probably have to be put down.

Scene: The savage attack happened on this quiet street in Accrington, Lancashire

His brother Steve Chadwick said: ' He knows they are not naturally bad.

'He is happy for these pictures to be used if it warns people of the dangers involved with badly brought up dogs.'  

Lancashire Police Inspector John Fryer said: 'This was a very nasty incident where a man on Fife Street was bitten by two Staffordshire bull terriers.

'He was bitten on the face, leg and side of the body and the injuries are quite nasty.

'He is in hospital now and is going to need surgery.'
