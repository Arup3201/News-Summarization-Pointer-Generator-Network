An ex-Goldman Sachs hotshot trader is suing the investment bank after his 2010 bonus was almost $5 million less than he had told his mom he was going to get, it was revealed today.

Deeb Amin Salem, 35, was less than impressed when he received an annual bonus of ‘just’ $8.25m instead of the $13m he had been bragging about.

Salem ran a massively successful mortgage-trading desk at Goldman and claims he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration documents.

‘Let’s be very clear: I was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,’ Salem said during the February 25 hearing, reports Bloomberg News.

‘I had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout - from that day, from almost every month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.’

In 2009, the cocksure trader had received a $15 million bonus – out-earning even Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

When 2010 proved another bumper earner for Salem’s desk, he was confident his bonus would reflect the success and he was shocked when it didn’t.

Salem, pictured with his wife Lauren, told the FINRA arbitration that he believes his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he had received about his 2007 self-evaluation

Salem told the arbitration that he believes his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he had received about his 2007 self-evaluation.

The trader gained some notoriety after the financial crisis because a U.S. Senate panel made the performance review public in 2011.

In the review, Salem detailed what he described as Goldman’s plan to put a 'short squeeze' on the mortgage market. He also described himself as an expert trader and said he deserved to be promoted to managing director.

'I am as competitive as Michael Jordan,' Salem wrote. 'I don’t just want to win – I want to win every time and I want to steamroll the opposition.'

An his FINRA hearing earlier this year, Salem said the $8.25 million bonus didn’t reflect his contributions.

Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the firm could pay him whatever it wished as bonuses are discretionary and that the company considered his conduct in determining compensation.

A spokesperson for Goldman told Bloomberg that Salem's claims are 'utterly ridiculous.'

He left the bank in 2012 after his next bonus was 'just' $3 million and he currently works as a portfolio manager for a hedge fund.

Salem's claims were recently rejected by a FINRA panel. His attorney has just filed a petition in New York State Supreme Court.

Salem is seeking $16.5 million from the bank ($9.5 million and about 41,000 shares in deferred compensation), the report said.
