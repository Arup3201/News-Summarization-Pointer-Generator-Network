Jim Davidson has never been one to shy away from controversy.

So it's perhaps no surprise that the comedian looked right at home as he hobnobbed with Nigel Farage during a plush charity ball in London last night. 

The Celebrity Big Brother winner spent time chatting and sharing several jokes with the UKIP leader at the inaugural Care for Combat ball at the Dorchester Hotel.

Even Davidson's wife appeared to have been taken in by the politician's charm, happily posing for photos with the UKIP leader during the event.

Hobknobbing: The trio were attending the inaugural ball for the charity set up last year by Davidson

Michelle Cotton, who wore a floor-length red dress to the do, even stepped onto the dance floor with the politician for a slow dance at the end of the night. 

Farage, who donned a polka dot pink bow tie, attended the event alongside a host of other celebrities to raise money for the armed forces charity, which was set up by Davidson last year.  

They included charity spokesman Casey Batchelor and Luisa Zissman, both of whom are also part of the Celebrity Big Brother alumni. EastEnders actresses Barbara Windsor and Gillian Telforth were also seen at the event.

Last night's united front was not the first time Davidson and Farage have publicly appeared to join forces.

In an interview earlier this year, Davidson described UKIP as 'the Jim Davidson of the political world'. He told Digital Spy that he 'felt for UKIP'.  

He also revealed that Farage was one of the first people to phone him following his acquittal over sex allegations.

Speaking at the time, he said: 'I got a call from the Ukip leader, who I had never spoken to before, saying, "All right Jim, Nigel Farage, I hope you don't mind, I got your number from your agent.

"I just wanted to say bloody good news, fantastic, marvellous, I never believed a bloody word of it, all the best" and hung up.

'I could not believe it, what a nice guy!' 

The UKIP leader (left and right) was pulling his classic grinning expression as he stopped and chatted in a polka dot pink bow tie and a smart black suit 

The comedian was first arrested in January 2013 by detectives from Operation Yewtree, which was set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal.

He was re-arrested two months later after more women came forward. He faced 10 allegations, all of which he denied, and all involving adults dating back up to 35 years.

He was then cleared in August 2013 after the CPS ruled there was 'insufficient evidence'.

Even before his arrest, Davidson's brand of comedy divided TV fans in the past. The former Big Break frontman has been forced to defend his sense of humour on a number of occasions.

The politician, who launched his election campaign earlier this week, shared a dance with Ms Cotton 

He also appeared to be having a ball with Davidson's wife, Michelle Cotton, at last night's event 

Last year, he said in an interview: If I cured Aids and fed Africa and ended Ebola and found that missing aeroplane I'd still be that horrible racist, sexist, homophobic comedian. By people, with respect, who haven't seen me. Or are judging me from the past.'

During his time on 'CBB', he also provoked plenty of controversy, but eventually went on to win the show. 

Meanwhile, Farage was yesterday at the White Cliffs of Dover to launch his election campaign, which focuses heavily on immigration.  

The Care After Combat charity works to help servicemen and women when they return to civilian life.

Their mission statement explains that they work 'to help to maintain and promote camaraderie in the Veterans community for those feeling vulnerable or at unrest with society.'

It adds: 'We look to provide professional assistance where possible for the well-being of the Veteran and their family.'
