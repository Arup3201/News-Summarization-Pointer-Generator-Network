Jarryd Hayne will successfully realise his dream of playing in the National Football League – at least that’s what Super Bowl-winner Reggie Bush believes.

The Detroit Lions running back, who is preparing for Sunday's game at Wembley against the Atlanta Falcons, was asked about the prospect of his club signing the 26-year-old Australian.

Bush, 29, met Hayne while he was visiting Australia and watched him play in the State of Origin. He describes the fullback as a ‘good athlete’.

Reggie Bush, who landed in England with the Lions on Tuesday, spoke highly of Jarryd Hayne 

'I have not had a chance to speak to him recently, but when I did when I was in Australia. I spoke with him quite a bit about playing in the NFL and he seemed very excited about the opportunity.'

 The former University of Southern California Trojan, who previously dated Kim Kardashian, said he spoke to Hayne about switching sports:

'I just told him: "If you really want to do this than you should definitely go for it". I just talked about, I’ll give an example of when I was in New Orleans, there was an opportunity for me to either stay in New Orleans or get traded to Miami and I took that opportunity, that leap of faith to go to a different team and prove that I could be an every down back. I told him the same thing for him, ‘If you feel like you’ll never forgive yourself for not taking this opportunity than you should definitely go.'

Asked if he talked to any team-mate about Hayne, Bush continued: 'I spoke to Joique (Bell) about him and some of the running backs about him. We actually watched some of his highlight films and he’s a really good player. I got a chance to watch him play in Australia against the State of Origin. It was really exciting. Like I said, he’s a great player, he’s fast, he’s big, he’s strong and has everything it takes to play in this league.' 

Jaryd Hayne hopes to swap the NRL for the NFL

Hayne, who announced he was leaving the NRL during a tearful press conference and flew to Los Angeles on Sunday night, already is rumoured to have at least six teams interested in his services. 

The Lions, who have previously employed Norwegian placekicker Havard ‘Kickalicious’ Rugland, are believed to be one of the teams considering making a bid for Hayne.

Team president Tom Lewand was non-commital about the Australian, saying: 'We look at a lot of players and I’ll let Martin (Mayhew) comment on more specifics, but we’ll look at a lot of different guys in a lot of different areas. We’re always looking to make the team better.' 

When he was asked earlier this week about the prospect of his team signing the former Parramatta Eel, Detroit head coach Jim Caldwell said: ‘I can’t tell you much about that. I mean, I know who he is, obviously, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to tell you. I have no knowledge of it in that regard.’

The Lions (5-2) have had issues at running back this year as Bush and backups Joique Bell and Theo Riddick have all missed time with injuries, so Caldwell said it was possible Detroit’s front office was looking at Hayne.

‘It could be a personnel issue, but I’m not aware of it. Besides that, our focus is pretty narrow this time of the year, so getting out of that realm, it’s hard to do. But it could happen. Obviously, there are a lot of good athletes around this country, and there are a bunch of them playing other sports, you know, basketball, baseball, rugby, which is similar to our sport, and there is a lot of carryover. So, we’ll see’

The reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks have been linked to Hayne, as have the Los Angeles Kiss of the Arena Football League. Rockers Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of the legendary group of the same name are owners of the Kiss.

If Hayne avoids Kiss and the AFL and is able to make it in Detroit Rock City, it won’t be because Bush has spoken to team management on his behalf - at least not yet.

‘I didn't say anything directly to them about him, but I spoke to some of my team-mates about him and just showed them some of his highlights,’ Bush said. ‘He's a great athlete and I told him I definitely think he has a future in the NFL if he's serious about it.’

Just because Bush has kept mum about Hayne doesn’t mean the Lions potential interest in the Aussie import has gone unnoticed.

A Michigan construction company posted a Facebook poll on Wednesday morning asking if Lions fans would want the team to sign Hayne, suspended running back Ray Rice or simply stand pat.

It drew a number of responses, although many of them were bashing former Baltimore Raven and admitted domestic abuser Rice.

The story of Hayne making it in the NFL would be a much more positive one, especially because other rugby players have been somewhat unsuccessful in the past.

Australian Hayden Smith, now of a member of Saracens FC caught a single pass in five games with the New York Jets as a tight end in 2012. American Carlin Isles, formerly of the Glasgow Warriors, previously attempted to make the Lions but was cut earlier this year.
