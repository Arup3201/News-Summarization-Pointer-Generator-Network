Two daredevil cyclists ride down a near vertical dam in these terrifying images.

Ben Miller, 18, and Adam Flint, 27, rode down the 140ft high slope in a breathtaking stunt in Perthshire, Scotland.

They flew down the 70 degree drop in a bid to raise awareness of the cycling opportunities in the area - although they admit their ride was not for beginners.

The pair performed a wall ride - cycling out from the grassy bank horizontally across the Lawers Dam on Lochan na Lairige before turning down the near vertical drop.

Ben and Adam pull out of the drop at the last minute and head off to the side to avoid crashing at the bottom.

Adam, 27, who runs a bike shop, said: 'It is called a wall ride - you approach from the side and cycle out across the dam and is common in cycling.

'To pull it off successfully you have got to have great balance. It is certainly not a ride for beginners.'

They carried out the stunt for the Highland Perthshire Cycling event which promotes cycling in the area.

Russell Cheyne who took the pictures said: 'The cyclists suddenly appeared from to the right of the dam and they cycled across before plunging downwards.

'It's hard to say how fast they were going but it was really quick. It is their skill - but is is not something that I could do!

'As they got to the bottom they pulled out at the last minute. If they hit the grass at the bottom their bikes would have just crumpled.'

Last year Adam threw himself and his bike off a parapet in the UK's first ever 'bungee on a bike' jump.

The daredevil made the spectacular 40-metre plunge off a bridge in Killiecrankie, Perth, into the wooded gorge of the River Garry below.

The breathless cyclist, from Dunkeld, Scotland, said afterwards he enjoyed the bungee but it left him feeling ‘a bit green’.
