Taxi driver Richard O'Brien has been jailed after admitting sexually assaulting a 94-year-old client in her care home in Cumbria

A taxi driver who abused a 94-year-old woman every time he collected her from her retirement home has been jailed after admitting sexual assault.

Richard O'Brien, 58, specialised in driving elderly people to hospital appointments and helping them do their shopping and advertised his services on a business card which bore the slogan 'Peace of mind - piece of cake.'

But he was arrested after a 94-year old woman who used his taxi services told police he had been sexually assaulting her at the care home she lived in in Cumbria.

Officers installed a secret spy camera in the frail woman's flat, and within days O'Brien was caught on film abusing her.

Today O'Brien, of Carlisle, pleaded guilty pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual assault and an unrelated offence of fraud and was jailed for two years.

Cumbria Police had told Carlisle Crown Court that for years, O’Brien had marketed his taxi services towards pensioners.

He built up a client base from the most vulnerable members of the community and transported frail elderly people on behalf of a local charity.

O'Brien's business card read: 'Are you a senior citizen or physically or medically disabled - I can help you to be more independent. I will see you safely on the train or bus and meet you on your return.

'Richard’s private hire will get you there.'

The victim was introduced to him in 2001 when she was living alone, and he ran errands for her including trips to the supermarket to do her shopping and take her to medical appointments.

When she could no longer live independently she moved into a retirement property, and O’Brien used her move as a chance to ingratiate himself on other residents, handing out his business cards and offering his services.

He would ring the intercom of a resident to gain access to the home, and would get in to assault the 94-year old without staff on duty realising he was there.

'Peace of Mind? Piece of Cake!' O'Brien's business card was specifically designed to attract vulnerable clients

O'Brien's card offered help with doctor and hospital visits, trips to the supermarket and odd jobs at home

Police were alerted after she complained, and in August 2012 a camera was placed in her sitting room.

Within days of its installation O’Brien was caught on camera sexually abusing the elderly woman.

Police also discovered that he had fraudulently withdrawn more than £4,000 of his late uncle’s pension payments.

Today Detective Constable Carolyn 
Willacy, from Cumbria Police, said: 'This kind and gentle lady has 
suffered regular degrading assaults over a long period of time.

 'This kind and gentle lady has suffered regular degrading assaults over a long period of time.  Due to frailty of body and mind she was unable to defend herself against his abuse.'

'Due to frailty of body and mind she was unable to defend herself against his abuse.

'O’Brien pleaded not guilty until the morning of trial, which caused further distress to those taking part in the trial.

'There is no excuse for his horrific crimes and the lasting impact they will have on the victim and her family.'

A Cumbria County Council spokesman said: 'This dangerous man has deliberately targeted the most vulnerable people in society causing untold harm and distress while showing no remorse for his actions.'

A child of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described how they felt after they discovered what had happened.

They said they felt: 'Angry, sickened, saddened, vulnerable, ashamed, and broken.

'My mum has looked after me well all my life and when it was my turn to look after her, I feel I should of done better. I will have to live with that for the rest of my life.

'To me Richard O’Brien has committed one of the worst crimes possible and I hope he too has to live with the consequences of what he has done for a long time to come.'
