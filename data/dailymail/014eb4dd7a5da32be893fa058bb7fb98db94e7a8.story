One of the busiest airports in the US was forced to close one of its runways after a plane blew two of its tyres while landing on Monday night.

Nearly 150 passengers and crew were stranded on the US Airways Airbus A320 because it was unable to taxi to the gate at Detroit Metro Airport.

No one was injured and the passengers had to be transported to the terminal by bus.

At least two flights had to be diverted to Cleveland while the runway was closed to allow airport workers to remove the plane, clean up debris and inspect the runway for any damage.

Detroit Metro Airport spokesman Mike Conway told CBS Detroit that the aircraft came to a halt at the intersection of a runway and taxiway.

He said: ‘The US Airways A320 landed on runway 21 right and blew a couple of tires, basically disintegrated the tires.’

Flight 2088 was surrounded by emergency crews as a precaution when it landed in Detroit around 8pm after flying in from Atlanta via Charlotte.

Casey Norton, a spokesman for American Airlines, told The Detroit News that the plane was decreasing speed when two tyres blew on its right side.

Aircraft technicians installed replacement tyres on the runway so the aircraft could be moved to the gate.

The runway remained closed Tuesday morning.
