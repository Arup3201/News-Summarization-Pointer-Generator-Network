Free at last: Journalist Michael Scott Moore, 45, a resident of Germany, was freed by Somali pirates Tuesday after spending more than two years in captivity 

A German-American journalist who was kidnapped in Somalia more than two years ago was freed Tuesday, according to a Somali police official and a leader of the Somali pirates who had held him.

The journalist, identified by the German weekly Der Spiegel as 45-year-old Michael Scott Moore, was immediately flown to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, after being freed, Somali police official Mohamed Hassan said by phone from the town of Galkayo in north-central Somalia.

Some of the pirates who held Moore reached a deal with negotiators after a ransom was paid, said Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the Somali coastal town of Hobyo. 

Moore, who was moved from place to place as his captors tried to avoid detection, was most recently held near the central Somali town of Adado, Hussein said, offering no more details.

Germany's Foreign Ministry confirmed that a 'German citizen who also had U.S. citizenship and who was kidnapped in Somalia was set free today' but wouldn't give further details.

Der Spiegel, for which Moore had freelanced, reported on its website Tuesday that Moore was taken by plane to the Somali capital, Mogadishu.

Spiegel's editor-in-chief Wolfgang Buechner said the magazine was grateful for the efforts of everyone who had helped bring about Moore's release.

Kidnapped: Moore, a freelance reporter for Der Spiegel, was picked up by Somali outlaws in January 2012 while researching a book about piracy 

Deal reached: The 45-year-old regained his freedom after a ransom was reportedly paid out to his captors 

'We never gave up hope and we're happy now with Michael and his mother Marlis that this nightmare is finally over,' he said. 

AFP reported via Yahoo News that sources familiar with the matter revealed that Moore appeared to be in good condition and 'thrilled to be free.'

The journalist and author will now undergo a medical check-up and psychological counseling.

Moore's mother, Marlis Saunders, from Redondo Beach, California, expressed her relief and joy after learning of her son's long-awaited liberation Tuesday.

‘We are just ecstatic that finally — after over 2 1/2 years — that he’s been released,’ Saunders told The Daily Breeze.

According to a Nairobi-based environmental and human rights group, Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates on the road to Galkayo airport in January 2012 while researching a book on piracy on a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

Plea: In this video released in May 2012, Moore appeared on camera at gunpoint asking for the governments of Germany and the US to pay his captors the full ransom

Prompted by one of the pirate speaking off camera in heavily accented English, Moore complained that he was in poor health, that he was being starved, and that his life in captivity was terrible

Over the past two and a half years, Moore's captors shared photos and videos of the hostage online as German and American officials negotiated for his release.

In a video made public in May 2012, Moore appeared on camera at gunpoint asking for the governments of Germany and the US to pay his captors the full ransom to stop them from selling him to the radical militant group Al-Shabaab.

Moore graduated from Mira Costa high School and made a name for himself as a surfing writer, publishing a book on the subject titled Sweetness in Blood.

Prior to his captivity, Moore lived in Berlin and worked as an editor-at-large of Spiegel Online, Der Spiegel's English-language website.

He also contributed articles to Atlantic Monthly, the Los Angeles Times and Salon.

Although piracy once was a scourge off the coast of Somalia, it has dropped significantly as a result of armed guards aboard cargo ships and an international naval armada that carries out onshore raids.
