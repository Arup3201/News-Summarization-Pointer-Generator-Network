A tourist who was held up at gunpoint while cycling through a rough neighbourhood in Argentina captured the entire incident on a helmet-mounted video camera.

Dramatic footage of the terrifying encounter begins with Canadian Alex Hennessy appearing to enjoy a relaxing morning cycle ride through a quiet part of the capital Buenos Aires.

A man on a motorcycle is then seen riding directly into his path in an attempt to stop him but Mr Hennessy steers around him and continues on his way.

But moments later the motorcyclist appears by his side and brandishes a pistol while shouting at Mr Hennessy in Spanish to hand over his backpack containing an expensive digital camera.

Mr Hennessy is eventually forced off his bicycle by the robber and attempts to run away, but the robber gives chase and catches up with him before continuing to threaten him with his gun.

Because he does not speak Spanish, Mr Hennessy was unable to understand exactly what the gunman was after.

After a brief struggle Mr Hennessy's friend Mike Graziano manages to pull him away from the robber and the pair run off down the street.

The pair eventually make it to a group of concerned cyclists who lend Mr Hennessy a bike and he pedals off down the street until he makes it to a traffic policeman.

Clearly shaken, Mr Hennessy, who was wearing a GoPro video camera on his helmet, then breaks out laughing.

He tells a group of concerned bystanders: 'I've got that entire thing on my GoPro right now.'

Mr Graziano showed footage of the incident to police who recognised the robber and arrested him. It is not known if he has been charged.

Mr Hennessy who is on a round the world trip, had already visited several South and Central American countries including Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru and Nicaragua.

A keen videographer he has been posting 'episodes' of his trip on the internet so friends and family can follow his progress.

As well as the GoPro camera on his helmet he also had an expensive Canon camera hanging from his backpack which the robber saw.

After the incident he posted tips for travellers saying: 'Don’t travel with your camera out, use your common sense.

'Give up your camera don’t take the risk, I think we were stupid about it.'

Aftermath: A policeman comes to the aid of the shaken tourist. The robber was later arrested after officers recognised him from the footage
