With her enviable figure, pretty face and long hair you wouldn't think Lucy Harrold, 25 from Tamworth, would struggle to find a date.

But the lingerie model, who has appeared in a host of men's magazines maintains she never gets chatted up and is 'unlucky in love.'

To solve her romance woes, Lucy - together with her friend entrepreneur Jack Knowles - set up a website for similar singletons in her home town of Birmingham.

Unlucky in love: Lucy, 25, from Tamworth, has set up a dating website with her friend, BirminghamLove.co.uk

BirminghamLove.co.uk aims to set people up without the pressure of speed dating.

'It's not as simple to meet people as it used to be,' says Lucy, who has featured in men's magazines Zoo, Nuts and Loaded.

'I think blokes are intimidated to approach people.

'I'm unlucky in love and it's a nightmare trying to find a guy to take me on a date.

'A lot of guys assume I've got a boyfriend or that because I'm a model I won't be interested but it's not true. 

Red alert: Lucy went out every weekend in the hope of finding a boyfriend. She even appeared on the dating show Take Me Out, but still did not find romance

Lonely: Lucy, pictured here, once dated England rugby star Danny Care but says she hasn't been bought a drink in months

'People don't even offer to buy me drinks if I'm on a night out. I genuinely find it difficult to find a date to go on at all.'

After failing to find love 
through conventional routes, Lucy decided to go on the Saturday night prime time dating show Take Me Out, but even her long stint on the programme didn't help her find a man.

It was then that Lucy, who once dated England rugby player Danny Care, thought up the idea for the Birmingham-only dating website.

'We wanted to do a location-based site because I love Birmingham,' she says.

'I'm well-travelled and always up and down the country for 
work, but definitely want to date a Brummie.

Hoping for success: Lucy wants other in Birmingham to find love as well as her. 'We're going to run classy cocktail evenings where everyone is single so people feel more able to start conversations,' she says

'The city has 
got so much going for it, there's a great nightlife, it's really 
multicultural, and the people and their accents, are fantastic. I love 
it.'

She added: 'People don't believe me when I tell them I can't get a date and that's where my passion to start the site came from.

'I can't think of anything worse than an old school speed-dating event with a buzzer and clipboard.

'I'm quite a private person so dating online is the perfect option for me. Why not just set up my own site?

'We're going to run some classy cocktail evenings as well, where everyone is single, so people feel more able to start conversations.'

Jack, meanwhile, says: 'I can't believe Lucy's still single. Even though we've been friends for years it's still a shock.'
