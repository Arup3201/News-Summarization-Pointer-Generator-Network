Arsene Wenger is adamant his squad is ready to challenge for the title and believes they will be crowned Premier League champions within three years.

Arsenal are 13 points adrift of pacesetters Chelsea after an indifferent start to the season which has seen them win just five times in the league and crash out of the Capital One Cup at the first hurdle against Southampton.

But ahead of his side’s clash against the Saints on Wednesday, Wenger, under fire from a portion of Arsenal supporters, insists his side can turn their fortunes around.

Asked if he could win his fourth title as Arsenal boss before his contract expires in 2017, Wenger said: ‘Of course. We have not started very well, but we never had the squad together since the start of the season. It was a post-World Cup start typically.

‘I think we have what is requested to do it. We have to fight like mad now to come back as much as possible to show that we can compete in every single game.’

Arsenal have gone 10 years since they last won the Premier League, but claimed their first silverware since 2005 after winning the FA Cup last year. 

And despite Chelsea emerging as runaway favourites to win the title, Wenger insists the race isn’t over.

Some Arsenal supporters have vented their frustrations towards Arsene Wenger in recent times 

‘We have fought many times for the title. People always remember who won it, but the fight has been very tight for long periods in the last eight or nine years. We have a big competition in England, we have to accept that.

‘The Premier League level goes always up and this season Chelsea have started very well. They will be difficult to catch, but everybody will fight to come back on them.

‘After 13 or 14 games, you cannot say that the title race is over. You cannot say that is not catchable.’

Arsenal tackle Southampton at the Emirates with injury concerns  over Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs, which could see Mathieu Flamini asked to play in defence. Hector Bellerin, 19, is also on stand-by.
