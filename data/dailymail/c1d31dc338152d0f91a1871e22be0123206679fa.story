The success of Taco Bell's Dorito Loco taco shell has the snack food's owner Pepsico scrambling to find new ways to use its cheese dust.

PepsiCo, which owns Cheetos, Fritos, Tostitos and other snacks, found huge success last year after teaming up with Taco Bell to create Dorito-flavored taco shells, sales of which topped $1 billion in October.

Since the enormous boon, Pepsico has been eager to dream up other restaurant dishes featuring the popular snack.

The new salt? The unparalleled success of the Taco Bell/Doritos mash-up has Doritos parent company Pepsico scrambling to figure out how to get the addicting flavor dust onto more and more new products

The company announced Thursday that it struck a deal to serve its drinks at Buffalo Wild Wings, snatching a significant client from beverage rival Coca-Cola Co.

PepsiCo also said it would work with the sports-centric chain to create 'unique menu offerings.'

During a trip to PepsiCo's food innovation lab, Buffalo Wild Wings CEO Sally Smith said in an interview that she was shown several dishes that might be a hit with the chain's customers.

The company envisions Doritos as a cheesy topping for deep fried, saucy wings or tenders or even on a side of fried potatoes.

Smith said she was shown ideas for salad dressings and sandwich and chicken wing sauces that incorporate PepsiCo's colas, including Mountain Dew.

'I don't think it will be in the next 12 months, but we'll possibly start testing after a year or 18 months,' she said, noting that considerable research and planning would be needed to bring the offerings to the company's more than 975 U.S. locations.

PepsiCo clearly sees the idea of incorporating its snacks into menus as a major opportunity.

Pizza Hut, for instance, has also looked at ways to team up with Frito-Lay snacks, according to a representative. Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands, which is also the parent company of Taco Bell and KFC.

Countless possibilities: Pepsico announced Thursday a partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant will now serve Pepsi beverages and says there are other Doritos-based down the pipeline, such as buffalo chicken wings topped with Doritos chips

Hidden Valley Dew: Pepsico and Buffalo Wild Wings have also brought up the possibility of sauces and salad dressing that incorporate Pepsi soft drinks, such as Mountain Dew

Over at Taco Bell, Doritos Locos 
Tacos have been and a considerable sales driver, boosting the fortunes 
of both PepsiCo and Yum.

The
company brought onboard an additional 15,000 employees last year in 
large part to handle the additional business driven by Doritos Locos 
tacos.

Taco Bell CEO 
Greg Creed has noted that a major advantage of the Doritos Locos Tacos 
is that nobody can replicate them â€” their success is largely tied to the
popularity of the Doritos brand.

The
latest partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings reflects PepsiCo's push to 
use the strength of its snacks business to bolster its beverage 
business, which has long trailed Coca-Cola.

That
campaign comes as PepsiCo fights off calls to split its drinks and 
snacks unit. PepsiCo has responded to the calls for a split by touting a
Power of One marketing campaign that features one of its snacks with 
one of its drinks.
