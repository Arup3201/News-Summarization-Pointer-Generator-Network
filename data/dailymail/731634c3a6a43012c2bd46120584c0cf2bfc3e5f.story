The grandfather of one of two best friends who died after a sports car crashed into a wall has paid tribute to his 'lovely happy' granddaughter.

Lily Butterfield-Godwin and Abbey Rogers, both 19, had been enjoying a night out on Friday at the Stag Hotel in Lyndhurst - where Lily worked behind the bar.

The pair - who were born on the same day - were then picked up by a friend but minutes later, and just half a mile from the pub, the car smashed into a wall on a 30mph road.

The driver, a 21-year-old man, and a third 19-year-old woman passenger remain in hospital with injuries, which are not believed to be life-threatening, according to Hampshire Police.

Emergency services were called to the picturesque New Forest village at around midnight after residents heard a loud bang like an 'explosion'

Lily's grandfather, Robin Butterfield, 82, today said the tragic pair 'were best of friends' and her work was just 'walking distance from her home'.

He said: 'They were best friends. They were born on the same day and sadly died on the same day.

'It is so tragic, the whole community has been shocked by this as she was a lovely girl.

'The family is completely devastated, especially her younger sister Connie.

'It was only walking distance from her home but she decided to get into the car.

'It was going around the one-way system and she was obviously being taken home.

The teenagers were pronounced dead at the scene. Floral tributes have since been laid for the best friends 

The road was closed over night while a police examination was carried out at the scene. It has now been re-opened

'She was a very happy and sensible girl and was studying to be fully qualified in childcare at college.

'It has had a huge impact on the family - everyone is distraught.

'You see these sights on the roadside and you never think it's going to be you do you? And one day it is.'

Emergency services were called to the picturesque New Forest village at around midnight after residents heard a loud bang like an 'explosion'. 

The  road was closed over night while a police examination was carried out at the scene. It has now been re-opened. 

Mourners arrived at the scene of the crash  to lay flowers and leave messages.

Many have being paying tributes to Lily, who worked in the bar and as a waitress at the Stag Hotel in Lyndhurst, as well as being a nanny.

Both of the girl's boyfriends wrote messages on social media saying they were devastated and 'lost' without them.

Abbey's boyfriend, Allix Dyson, 21, and Kane Parnell, Lily's boyfriend paid touching tributes to the girls.  

The sports car collided with the wall where the road forks left toward nearby Brockenhurst, and right towards Christchurch in Dorset

A message on the salon's Facebook page said: 'As you all know the velvet rooms has a fallen angel. One of our beloved team was taken from us. We are devastated. 

'She was an amazing girl and loved soooo much (sic). Please give us time to grieve. We apologise for any convenience.

'The Velvet Rooms will be closed until further notice due to bereavement.

'We have tried to contact all our clients with appointments. When we reopen we will rebook.'

Meanwhile, friends and colleagues of the two teenage girls have been paying tribute.

One of the notes at the scene reads: 'To Lilz, I love that you used to make belly full of butterflies.

'I will miss you everyday. You made every smile on my face in our time together. I love you so much. I will miss our 'Sundays'.'

Friends of Abbey have been posting tributes on her Facebook page.

Lillia Neale wrote: 'RIP Abbey, heaven has another angel now.'

Kerri Brannigan said: 'R.I.P to my beautiful friend you are gunna be missed so much love you baby girl xxx.'

Richard Collis said: 'Rest in peace Abbey you'll never be forgotten.'

Neighbours in the quiet New Forest village described the crash as being 'like a small explosion' and ran from their homes to offer help.

John Gibbs, 49, said: 'It was an almighty bang. It was obviously one car, it didn't sound like two cars hitting each other.

'It was like a small explosion, that was what it sounded like.

'They blocked the road off. We didn't go up to bed until 3am, there was no traffic until then.'

Mr Gibbs described how local residents went to help victims of the crash and how neighbours brought out sheets to cover one woman to keep her warm.

He added: 'I went out and somebody was calling for help. I thought it was round the corner as you couldn't see a thing - it was pitch black. 

Mark Thompson, who also lives nearby, added: 'It was like thunder.

'It must have had quite an impact - I can only imagine what it was like. It is tragic.'

The crash happened in Gosport Lane, part of the A35 which runs one way round the back of Lyndhurst high street.

The sports car collided with the wall where the road forks left toward nearby Brockenhurst, and right towards Christchurch in Dorset.

A total of 18 firefighters from across Hampshire attended the scene in an attempt to free the group of four.

They worked together to cut the driver and three young women from the car. Two ambulances and a response team were sent to the scene.

Hampshire Constabulary are appealing for witnesses to help establish the circumstances of the crash.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Police are investigating a road traffic collision in Lyndhurst after two young women died.

'Four people were travelling in the car: the driver, a 21-year-old man, and three passengers, all 19-year-old women.

'Two of the passengers were pronounced dead at the scene.'
