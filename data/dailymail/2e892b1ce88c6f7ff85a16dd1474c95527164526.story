A 15-year-old schoolgirl who was found dead on the tracks at London's St Pancras station had visited a website featuring self harm and anorexia, campaigners said today.

They called for websites to be forced to remove content that glamorises suicide and self harm to help prevent any more deaths like that of the private school pupil from Hampstead.

Tallulah was struck by a train on Sunday after posting messages on Twitter about killing herself.

Shocking discovery: Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead on the tracks at St Pancras International station after she was struck by a train

She wrote 'I'm done' and added the hashtag '#suicide' in a tweet dedicated to 15-year-old Rosie Whitaker, who died in similar circumstances in Beckenham in July, after being bullied online.

Tallulah, who had reportedly been bullied at her school, wrote: 'why the f*** should I stay if no one around me stay for
me? It’s not f***ing fair. I’m done. I’m f***ing done #suicide 
#goodbye.'

It was followed by another harrowing message last week that read: 'I don’t want to wake up anymore'.

A family spokesman said: 'Tallulah 
will always be remembered as a loving daughter and caring sister. She 
was a clever, cheerful and creative girl with a talent for dance and 
huge potential. She will be sadly missed by all those who knew her.

'The family now request the media leave them to grieve and respect their privacy.'

Campaigners today called on the government and internet companies to do more to prevent young people accessing harmful websites.

Tallulah, who lived with her family in £1million Victorian terraced house in West Hampstead, was a pupil at £11,000-a-year St Margaret’s School. She started at the school in September after leaving St Marylebone School, where she had reportedly been bullied.

Mark Webster, head of St Margaret’s School, said: 'Tallulah had only been with us for a few weeks but she was already a very popular member of our community, well-liked by literally all who knew her, teachers and staff alike.

'Her good-natured charm, kind manner and sweet sense of humour will be deeply missed. We feel for her family and are thinking of them at this very difficult time.'

Elizabeth Phillips, head of St Marylebone School, did not comment on questions about bullying, but said: 'St Marylebone School offers pastoral care and counselling services to our pupils, rated excellent by Ofsted. That support is available at this time as it is throughout the year.'

A spokeswoman for eating disorder 
charity Beat said: 'Our heart goes out to Tallulah’s family at the loss 
of such a young life. Pro-anorexia sites, although not directly a cause 
of an eating disorder can be particularly dangerous in that they 
encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style 
choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are. 

'They also encourage people to avoid treatment.

'There
is no internationally enforceable legislation in this area and indeed 
many of these sites are run by young people who are ill and we are not 
sure what purpose it would serve to criminalise someone with a serious 
mental illness.'

A spokeswoman for The Samaritans said: 'Samaritans agrees that certain types of suicide-related material online can be potentially dangerous when accessed by vulnerable individuals.

'It is important that organisations which run sites that are highly popular with young people develop responsible practices around suicide-related content, including promoting sources of support and by removing content which actively encourages or glorifies self harm or suicide.

'However, we also know that many people find emotional support by using online forums, blogs and social networking sites to discuss feelings of distress and despair and so the right balance has to be struck to make sure that legitimate online dialogue about suicidal feelings is not prohibited.'

Emma-Jane Cross, CEO of BeatBullying said: 'We know from our research that young people are alarmed by the number of self-harm and suicide sites they encounter in their cyber lives and for young people who become engaged in these sites they can be incredibly damaging and have devastating consequences.

'Much is being done, by various organisations and children themselves, but the government and the internet industry must take the issue of keeping children safe online more seriously. It is clear that we cannot afford to wait any longer for this to happen.'

Loved: The head of St Margaret's School in Hampstead said Tallulah 'was already a very popular member of our community', despite only having been at the school for a few weeks

Tallulah, nicknamed Toots, had sung in the junior choir at the parish church of St John in Hampstead, where news of her death was announced to worshippers at Evensong on Sunday.

One churchgoer said: 'It’s very sad. She has two siblings and was well known at the church. There was even a CD produced not long ago with music from the choir. We weren’t told exactly what happened. It’s such a tragedy.'

Tallulah’s friends expressed sadness about the loss of the 'beautiful' and 'loved' girl on Twitter, with many suggesting that bullying may have been a trigger for her death.

One friend tweeted: 'Bullying is such a sick thing. RIP Tallulah.'

Another wrote: 'Rip tallulah wilson - didn’t know you but everyone was crying at school today so you were loved.'

Another said: 'Never really knew you, but you’ll never be forgotten! RIP Tallulah wilson, so young and left school cause of bully’s.'

Jenny Stephen, headteacher of nearby South Hampstead High School, wrote to parents about Tallulah’s death because she had been friends with some pupils there.

Ms Stephen wrote: 'A Year 11 girl at another school, who was friends with some girls at our school, committed suicide yesterday [Sunday]. This has obviously been an enormous shock to all the girls who knew her.

'I wanted to let you know so that you are aware your daughter may come home upset or be upset in the coming days.'

She added: 'Our experience would tell us that Facebook will play a huge part in communicating between pupils their feelings. Of course, restricting access to Facebook and other social media sites is hard but the communication can happen 24/7 and can be quite difficult for the students to handle.'

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'BTP officers attended St Pancras International Railway Station on Sunday 14th October 2012 at around 1005 hours after a report that a person had been struck by a train.

'Officers from BTP attended the scene, which was reported to police at 1002 hours and this incident is currently being treated as non-suspicious.

'Paramedics from the London Ambulance Service also attended but sadly, a female was pronounced dead at the scene.'
