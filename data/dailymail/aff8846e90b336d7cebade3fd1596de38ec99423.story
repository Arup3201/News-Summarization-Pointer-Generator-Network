A Nazi-themed troupe of dancers and a  Second World War tank gate-crashed the start of Ukip’s spring conference in Margate today.

Performers in hot pants, jackboots and Nazi insignia goose-stepped to 'Springtime For Hitler' as delegates arrived in the Kent seaside town - including Nigel Farage's German wife Kirsten.

The scene overshadowed the opening session of the conference, ahead of Mr Farage's key-note speech this afternoon.

Nigel Farage was upstaged this morning as dancing Nazis and a 16 tonne World War II TANK crashed UKIP's conference

The dancers, from Mel Brooks’s musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip’s conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent.

A seven-strong troupe of female dancers performed a choreographed routine as Springtime For Hitler blared from a PA system on the tank turret.

The cast were in Margate to promote the new touring production of the musical comedy about a failed producer who tried to put on the worst show ever.

The new UK production will features stand-up comics Jason Manford, Phill Jupitus and Ross Noble – as well as TV celebrity Louie Spence.

It comes as Mr Farage prepared to address the Ukip conference this afternoon after jetting back from the US where he spoke at America's leading conservative conference in Washington.

The Ukip leader flew to Washington to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘red eye’ flight home overnight to get back in time for the Ukip conference.

Ukip MP Mark Reckless was given a standing ovation by delegates at the party's spring conference. Among 

But Mr Farage was handed the 'graveyard' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000.

Mr Farage delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by Sarah Palin, the darling of Tea Party conservatives. 

But the Ukip leader was given a major boost today after research was published indicating he is on track to win the nearby seat of South Thanet.

The Survation survey, funded by party donor Alan Bown, put Mr Farage on 39 per cent ahead of Labour rival Will Scobie on 28 per cent when people were prompted with candidate names.

A previous poll by Tory Lord Ashcroft in November had suggested the Conservatives could retain the seat - where their MP Laura Sandys is stepping down.

At the party's conference today, Ukip MP Mark Reckless today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the ‘party of the NHS’.

Mr Reckless, who won a by-election in Rochester and Strood after defecting from the Tories, said currently voters knew Ukip wanted to leave the EU and cut immigration.

But the party must ‘talk about other things as well’ and reassure people it is not a threat to the NHS in order to have wider appeal.

Mr Reckless told activists: ‘There are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the European Union, and we want to cut immigration.

‘We should talk about those things. But if we want to get beyond 20 per cent-30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies, we will have to explain why we want those things, challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party, and talk about other things as well.’

Speaking in the US last night Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre.

Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.'

'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.'

He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 

'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.'

He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.'

'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 

'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.'

'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.

'The thing about us 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.'

While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.'

Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen

'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party

Mr Farage said the Republican Party was 'going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'.

Ukip, he boasted, was 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.'

But he said: 'We're not the tea party. Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.'
