A  fireman saved a family when their car caught fire on the way to the airport - then gave them a lift to make sure they caught their flight.

Phil Nelson spotted smoke and flames coming from a people carrier as he drove behind it up the M56 motorway.

After using his flashing lights to pull them over, he single-handedly moved them to safety, directed traffic around from the fire - then drove them in his own car the rest of the way to Manchester Airport.

Luckily for the family, who were on their way to Hong Kong, Mr Nelson managed to get them and their luggage out of the burning car before it was completely engulfed in flames and then took them to Manchester Airport

Mr Nelson was returning from a firefighting conference where he met colleagues from Hong Kong 

The family had been getting a lift from a friend to catch a flight for their holiday to Hong Kong when the grey Renault Scenic they were travelling in caught fire on the M56 eastbound carriageway.

Mr Nelson was only driving back up the M56 because he had just been at North West Fire Control in Warrington meeting a delegation of firefighters - visiting from Hong Kong.

Mr Nelson, station manager at Wythenshawe fire station, said: 'I was driving back from seeing visitors from Hong Kong at control when I saw the Renault Scenic ahead.

'First there was smoke coming out the engine, then flames started dropping down from it.

'I put my lights on to flash them to pull over and as soon as they stopped and oxygen pooled around the engine compartment, it went up in a flash.

'I was trying to ring it in to control and the family were trying to get all their luggage out the boot.'

After rescuing the family, Mr Nelson, pictured, managed the scene until his colleagues arrived with a fire engine

He continued: 'I helped them with that, then got them back from the area, put my safety gear on and went to warn other motorists.

'I was trying to move cars from lane one when highway services arrived.

'The car was just a shell, but the family and their friend seemed quite positive - they were just happy they were all ok.

'If the car had exploded or fumes had come in through the ventilation system the outcome could obviously have been very different.

'Luckily, I had a people carrier with me so I got them and their luggage to the airport in time. It was just an extra piece in my crazy day.'

The family, whose names were not recorded by the fire service, were happy to pose for a snap with Mr Nelson at the airport.

A relative of the driver has since contacted the firefighter to thank him.
