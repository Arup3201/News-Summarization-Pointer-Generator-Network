There was real-life drama on the Gold Coast set of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film when an intruder dressed as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow brandished a knife at security.

The young man broke onto the set wearing an extravagant pirate costume, complete with a live bird, dreadlocks and heavy eye-liner.

The impersonator's costume was so convincing he was initially mistaken for one of the film’s extras.

Not only does the young man resemble Johnny Depp's character Captain Jack Sparrow, he also has the same disregard for rules and frustrating ability to avoid capture.

Not only does the young man resemble Johnny Depp's character Captain Jack Sparrow (picture), he also has the same disregard for rules and frustrating ability to avoid capture. He and his bird remain on the run

Police were alerted to the incident at 12.30pm after the intruder threatened a security guard with a knife.

It was initially reported that the wannabe buccaneer brandished a sword.

He fled the set into nearby bushland and remains on the run. A sizeable police and dog squad was called to the set but the man and his bird are yet to be remanded.

There were reports that he was seen running through nearby Helensvale but it is unknown if he is still dressed in pirate attire.

Police are still looking for him 12 hours after his disappearance but have scaled down the search.

The Jack Sparrow lookalike was allegedly trying to join the cast of the film.

Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Orlando Bloom, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush are some of the major stars that will be filming 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' in Australia.

The fifth instalment of the incredibly popular ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ franchise has just begun filming in Helensvale on Queensland’s Gold Coast. Scenes will also be filmed in Port Douglas.

The man has been described as being 177 centimetres tall and tanned with shoulder length, brown dreadlocks and a real rosella on his shoulder.
