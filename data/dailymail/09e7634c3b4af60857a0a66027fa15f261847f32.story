Witnesses said a plane carrying a woman wing walker and her pilot was going 'too low and too slow' before it crashed in ball of flames at air airshow Saturday afternoon.

Jane Wicker, a mother of two sons, was atop the biplane at the Vectren Air Show near Dayton, Ohio, when it plunged to the ground. The pilot, Charlie Schwenker, also perished in the crash after steering the plane away horrified onlookers.

'Had he drifted more, I don't know what would have happened,' said Ian Hoyt, an aviation photographer and 
licensed pilot from Findlay who was at the airshow with his girlfriend.

Hoyt said he was taking photos as the plane passed by and had just raised his camera to take another shot.

'Then I realized they were too low and too slow. And before I knew it, they hit the ground,' he said.

Hoyt said he couldn't tell exactly what happened, but it appeared that the plane stalled and didn't have enough air speed, he said. He credited the pilot for steering clear of spectators and potentially saving lives.

Another spectator, Thanh Tran of 
Fairfield, said he could see a look of concern on the wing walker's face
just before the plane went down.

'She looked very scared,' he said. 
'Then the airplane crashed on the ground. After that, it was terrible, 
man ... very terrible.'

Other witnesses reported hearing screams as the plane dived to the
ground.

'All of a sudden I heard screaming and looked up and there was a fire ball,' Stan Thayer of Wilmington told the Dayton Daily News.

Shawn Warwick was also at the event and watching the crash through binoculars.

'I noticed it was upside down 
really close to the ground. She was sitting on the bottom of the plane,'
he said. 'I saw it just go right into the ground and explode.'

Terrence Slaybaugh, the director of 
aviation for Dayton, confirmed their deaths around 2 p.m. The crash 
occurred at around 12:45 p.m.

A video posted on WHIO-TV shows the small plane turn upside-down as the performer sits on top of the wing. The announcer narrates as the plane glides through the sky and rolls over while Wicker perches.

'Now she's still on that far side. Keep an eye on Jane. Keep an eye on Charlie. Watch this! Jane Wicker, sitting on top of the world,' the announcer said, right before the plane makes a quick turn and nosedive, erupting into flames as spectators screamed.

The show was canceled for the rest of
the day, but organizers said events would resume Sunday and follow the 
previous schedule and normal operations. The National Transportation 
Safety Board said it is investigating the crash.

In an interview earlier this week with WDTN, Wicker expressed no apprehension about today's flight.

'I'm
never nervous or scared because I know if I do everything as I usually 
do, everything's going to be just fine,' Wicker said.

Wicker was well-known as a wing walker after being introduced
to the daredevil activity through a Flying Circus ride she received as a birthday present.

Tragically, a picture on Facebook seems to indicate that she had recently become engaged.

Lives saved: Wicker's pilot, Charlie Schwenker, also perished in the crash, but not before one witness said he steered the plane away from spectators, possibly saving lives

Mother: Wicker was the mother of two sons. She met her now ex-husband through flying and for a while he was her pilot until the marriage dissolved

According to her 
website, Wicker was a full-time budget-analyst at the FAA, a freelance 
writer and had recently returned to school to earn a degree in finance.

Wicker wrote on her site that she never had any close calls.

'What you see us do out there is after an enormous amount of practice and fine tuning, not to mention the airplane goes through microscopic care. It is a managed risk and that is what keeps us alive,' she wrote.

Wicker first got interested in aviation after taking a ride with a friend in 
1988. After her first flying lesson she was hooked and continued to pay 
for all of her flying lessons until she received her pilot's certificate
in 1989.

Wicker went on to get her several other pilot's ratings, all while working full-time.

For
a birthday present in 1989, she was gifted with an aerobatic plane ride.
She loved it and a year later applied to be a wing walker after seeing a
classified ad in the Washington Post.

The first time she walked on a wing was also her first air show.

Wicker
met her now ex-husband Kirk Wicker at a wing-walking audition. Jane and Kirk 
joined up and they created 'Beauty and the Beast Wing Walking' together.
She would walk on the wings while Kirk would fly the plane. When their 
marriage dissolved in 2002, Wicker took a break from wing walking. The couple had two sons, one of which - Ben Wicker - just recently graduated high school.

She got back into wing walking in 2009 when she bought a new plane, Aurora, and re-entered the Airshow Circuit.
