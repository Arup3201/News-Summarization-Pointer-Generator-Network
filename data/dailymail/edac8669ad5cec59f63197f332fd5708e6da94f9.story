Adding fuel to the fiery debate over immigration in Arizona, U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain has blamed illegal immigrants for starting some of the wildfires that have torched hundreds of thousands of acres in his state.

Mr McCain said at a press conference Saturday: 'There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally'.

The Republican senator added: 'They have set fires because they want to to signal others, they have set firs to keep warm, and they have set fires to divert law enforcement agencies from them.

'The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border'.

Mr McCain did not say what evidence he had for those charges, or what the source was. As a result, Latino civil rights advocates have criticized his statements.

Randy Parraz, a civil rights activist who ran unsuccessfully against McCain as a Democrat in 2010, told CNN: 'It's easier to fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona'.

Mr Parraz said Mr McCain 'should know better' than to make such a 'careless and reckless' accusation without presenting any facts.

While firefighters battle five wildfires that have burned 732,427 acres in Arizona, the causes of the blazes are under investigation. 

Mr Parraz said. 'People are looking for someone to blame', especially one of Arizona's 'most vulnerable populations'.

Meanwhile, about 3,000 people from 1,700 homes were evacuated 
Sunday as the Monument blaze - burning for a week - picked up speed with winds 
gusted up to 60 mph, Cochise County sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas 
said late Sunday night.

Ms Capas told the AP: 'Winds pushed fire across Highway 92, making run so 
fast and so hot that the danger to citizens in the path was 
significant'.

The flames raced down a mountain and into a heavily 
populated area, forcing crews to abandon their lines and set up in new 
spots.

'The fire crews are doing an amazing job, trying to get in front of it', she said.

Sunday's evacuations brought the total number to 
about 10,000 people from 4,300 homes forced to flee flames of the 
Monument fire, she said.

Some residences were destroyed Sunday, adding to the 
44 already reported, but fire officials still don't have an exact 
number, Capas said. Among the destroyed structures was a popular Mexican
restaurant. There have been no serious injuries.

She said evacuees have been staying with friends and relatives, at three evacuation shelters, and at local inns.

Debbie 
Schmidlin told the Arizona Daily Star: 'This is horrible. This is a nightmare'.

She said she was evacuated twice 
in the past week from homes east and west of Highway 92.

'If this fire gets there, I'm leaving Arizona', she said as she watched from behind police lines two miles north of her home.

Mario Morales, who has a mobile home on land he owns 
on the east side of 92, was philosophical. 'You just gotta accept it', 
he told the newspaper. 'There is no stopping this monster'.

Winds had diminished by late Sunday and were projected to reach just 10 mph Monday. That would make battling the blazes easier.

Before the winds spread the flames earlier in the 
day, the blaze was reported 27 per cent contained at about 21,000 acres 
or nearly 33 square miles.

Meanwhile, the massive Wallow fire that has been 
burning in eastern Arizona for three weeks kept about 200 residents of 
Luna, N.M., under an evacuation order for a second day.

A containment line that had held through days of high
winds was breached Saturday and the fire raced toward town before 
shifting winds steered it around the community. It was moving to the 
north into an area of scattered ranches late Sunday afternoon, fire 
information officer Michael Puentes said.

Despite the evacuation order for Luna, about half the town's residents remained in town.

Catron County Undersheriff Ian Fletcher said: 'If the fire comes back around or things change where they have to get 
out, we still have an egress point, so we will still escort them out of 
town'.

Evacuation orders for Luna came on the same day that some other 
residents displaced by the fire that began May 29 were allowed to return
home.

Residents of Alpine, Ariz., were allowed to return to their homes 
Saturday morning after being forced out for more than two weeks, while 
residents of the resort town of Greer will be allowed to return home 
late Monday morning.

The Wallow blaze has consumed nearly 800 square miles, a little more 
than 511,000 acres, and more than 3,500 firefighters were trying to stop
its advance.

It is larger than a 2002 fire that burned 732 square miles
and destroyed 491 buildings that had been the largest in state history.
Despite its size, the latest fire has destroyed just 32 homes and four 
rental cabins. Containment rose to 51 per cent Sunday.

The Wallow fire, which is burning up much of the Apache-Sitgreaves National 
Forest, is the largest of several wildfires burning in spots across the 
southwestern United States.

• In Texas, firefighters working to contain a massive wildfire in East 
Texas were expecting unusually hot and windy weather Monday, a day after
several blazes broke out across the state and destroyed more than three
dozen homes. Hundreds of people were told to evacuate after fires swept
through eastern and central parts of the state.

• A new wildfire ignited Sunday in northcentral Arizona that officials 
said could threaten powerlines running to Phoenix as well as some 
scattered ranches in coming days. Eric Nietel, spokesman for the Show 
Low fire department, said late Sunday night that the blaze, about 40 
miles northeast of Payson, had burned about 500 acres.

• A fire burning on both sides of the New Mexico-Colorado border outside
of Raton, N.M. was 80 per cent contained and evacuations had all been 
lifted. The fire apparently was started June 12 by engine exhaust from 
an all-terrain vehicle trespassing on railroad property.

• Another wildfire in Cochise County, Arizona, called Horseshoe Two was 75
per cent contained after charring about 210,000 acres - nearly 330 
square miles. It has destroyed 23 structures since it started May 8.

• A fire burning 9 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, had burned about 900 
acres by Sunday morning and was being driven northeast into the Pecos 
Wilderness, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Alberta Maez said. The fire 
broke out Saturday and was not threatening any structures.

• Authorities in southern New Mexico were looking for 'persons of 
interest' as they searched for the cause of a fire that burned several 
homes in the wooded community of Ruidoso.
