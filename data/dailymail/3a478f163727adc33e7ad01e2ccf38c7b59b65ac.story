Carlo Ancelotti’s early season crisis at Real Madrid intensified as the European Cup holders were beaten 2-1 by Atletico Madrid leaving them six points behind leaders Barcelona having lost two of their opening three games of the season.

They were booed and whistled off the pitch at the end of the game after a tame second half where they showed and alarming lack of spirit and imagination against a dogged Atletico Madrid side.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 13th goal against Atletico Madrid but Gareth Bale looked lost in Real’s new 4-4-2 formation and was a taken off midway through the second half.

Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez made his debut in the second but failed to bring his new team the three points and Ancelotti will now be under pressure to knock his 500million euro squad into shape ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League opener against Basle.

His opposite number celebrated the win high in the main stand with his son. Diego Simeone is still serving a ban for being sent off the last time he faced Real – beating them in the Spanish Super Cup. He can be proud of having led the current La Liga champions to their second consecutive league win in the Santaigo Bernabeu.

It didn’t take long for the first foul of another tetchy game between these sides with Raul Garcia jumping knee-first into the side of Fabio Coentrao. 

Atletico Madrid were breaking up Real’s play with ease and with Bale over-running the ball down the right and Ronaldo over-elaborating with too many step-overs on the other flank it was the visitors who started the better of the two sides.

On 10 minutes they had the lead. Alvaro Arebeloa conceded a corner and Tiago got in front of Benzema to head past Iker Casillas who had stayed rooted to his line. There seemed almost too many Real Madrid players in the six-yard box with Ronaldo even barging his own team-mate Coentrao as they attempted unsuccessfully to defend the corner.

Real Madrid tried to hit back immediately but James Rodriguez blasted over from a Ronaldo pass and Benzema was also wasteful. Sections of the Bernabeu were booing Casillas’ every touch despite it being 15 years almost to the day since he made his debut for the club.

The match was still scrappy with Ramos colliding with Mandzukic and Godin going into the book for a foul on Ronaldo. Bale’s free-kick was well saved by Miguel Moya. 

The next important foul would be inside in the area and would give Real Madrid a way back into the game. Siqueira brought down Ronaldo and was booked and the Portuguese scored from the spot. Real Madrid should have extended their lead but Benzema’s header was saved at point-blank range from Moya. 

Atletico had faded badly towards the end of the first period and when Mandzukic clattered his former Bayern Munich team-mate Kroos he became the third Atletico player to be booked.

The kicking continued into the second half with Gabi booked for a foul on James and Arbeloa yellow-carded for a foul on Gimenez. 

Neither side got into their stride and it was Atletico Madrid who made the first change with Arda Turan coming on for Gabi but it was not long before Javier Hernandez was stripping off and replacing Benzema. 

James headed a Ronaldo cross over but still both sides huffed and puffed with limited end product – maybe a symptom of having played each other seven times now this calendar year.

Bale was the next to make way with Isco replacing him. But the midfielder’s first effort was a curling shot that floated harmlessly wide. Far closer was Turan’s shot at the other end after he was shown inside. 

And the Turkish midfielder went one better minutes later when Juanfran crossed from the right, Raul Garcia dummied and Turan shot past Casillas to leave Real Madrid floundering in midtable after three games played.
