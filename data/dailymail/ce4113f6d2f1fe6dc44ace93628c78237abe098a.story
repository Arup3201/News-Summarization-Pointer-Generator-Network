Its picture-perfect streets and houses made it the ideal setting as the fictional village of Downton.

And the Cotswolds village of Bampton has enjoyed a surge in tourism thanks to its starring role in Downton Abbey.

But residents are up in arms at the prospect of being overrun by more than the show’s devotees – thanks to a new housing development proposed under the Government’s planning regulations.

The town has been overrun with admirers since Downton Abbey started filming there in 2010

Plans for 280 new homes in the Cotswolds village of Bampton have left residents up in arms with claims the town cannot cope with as many new residents

Plans are in place for 280 new homes to be built. But opponents to the proposals say the town of 2,500 people cannot accommodate hundreds of new residents.

The quaint location was chosen to be the fictitious village of Downton when filming for the period drama began in 2010. Since then, Bampton has enjoyed rocketing numbers of visitors, with devoted fans flocking to see where main characters Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley married.

But critics say if the estates are approved, Bampton – which was chosen by Downton producers because it was well-preserved – will lose its charm.

Trevor Milne-Day, chairman of the Society for the Protection of Bampton, told the Daily Telegraph that village life would be threatened by the new developments.

‘We are going to get lots of people living here who probably won’t work anywhere near here.

‘The feeling in the village is that quite often these new estates take an awfully long time to bed in and for people to get involved in village life.’

The planning application is for one estate of 127 houses and another of 160. Bampton parish council has come out against the smaller of the two proposals.

Chairman Jackie Allinson said that such a large number of new homes would be disruptive for the village.

She said new Government planning regulations mean the plans could be pushed through even if they were rejected by the local council. ‘We are understandably worried that if our local democracy supports us, it could be lost at a higher level,’ she added.

Viewers of the costume drama will be familiar with the village where Anna and her husband Mr Bates moved when they married.

Most of the programme is filmed in Highclere Castle, a manor house on a 5,000-acre estate in Berkshire.

West Oxfordshire District Council will make a decision on the smaller of the applications before Christmas, and on the larger one in January.

Mark Booty, a district councillor for Bampton, said: ‘The reality here is the National Planning Policy Framework sits in the background, saying, “if it’s sustainable you should allow it”, and the Government are saying, “build, build, build”. There’s going to be some very interesting discussion.’

Gladman Developments, the company behind the smaller housing scheme, declined to comment. 

The second developer, Richborough Estates, could not be contacted for a response.
