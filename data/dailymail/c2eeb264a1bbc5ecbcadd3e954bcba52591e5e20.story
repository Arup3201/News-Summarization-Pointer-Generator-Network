Manchester City were sent tumbling out of the UEFA Youth League in a highly volatile match with Roma - with three players being sent off over the 90 minutes. 

Kean Bryan was given his marching orders on the hour mark for his second yellow card and the Italian's took full advantage when Tomas Vestenicky fired home the opener.

The tense affair soon became heated and tempers began to flare before Jack Byrne followed his team mate into the changing rooms - leaving City with only nine men.

Just like their first goal, Roma pounced on Patrick Vieira's sides lack of discipline and Lorenzo Pellegrini - who shares the surname with a certain City staff member - fired home a stunning second.

The Blues were given a glimmer of hope when Elio Capradossi became the third player to be given a red card but this time for Roma, after he was adjudged to have brought down Angelino in the box. 

Thierry Ambrose converted the penalty, but the away side couldn't find the all important equaliser that would have sent the game to penalties.
