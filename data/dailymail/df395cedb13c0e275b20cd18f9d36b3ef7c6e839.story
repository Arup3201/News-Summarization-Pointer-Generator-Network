A photo has emerged which shows paedophile Jimmy Savile surrounded by children at a Jersey care home where 192 youngsters allegedly suffered abuse.

The Jersey home came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after police took statements from 192 alleged victims of historic child abuse at the home.

One hundred and fifty one alleged abusers were identified following the three year probe and seven were successfully prosecuted.

Savile has always denied he was a regular visitor at the home and when The Sun published this photograph in 2008 his lawyers tried to put a block on it, the newspaper said.

The photo is believed to have been taken in the late 1960s.

Last week, the former head of the 
Jersey child abuse investigation Lenny Harper said there was 'no reason 
to doubt' that Savile indecently assaulted girls there.

Harper, the Jersey police 
detective who led a three-year probe, said that Savile's 
name came up in the initial police inquiry four years ago.

However, he added that there were no specific allegations of abuse against the BBC presenter at the time and not enough evidence to proceed.

Mr Harper, who has since retired from
 the force, added: 'There definitely wasn't enough even to question him 
at the time, but in light of all the evidence that has come out then I'm
 not surprised because it fits perfectly the profile of what was going 
on.'

A solicitor who acted for victims 
said that some former Haut de la Garenne residents, both women and men, 
now claim they were assaulted by Savile in the 1970s.

Alan Collins said 'a handful' of former residents had now made abuse allegations about Savile.

One man this week said he was abused by the entertainer at the home aged 10.

The former Top Of The Pops presenter, who died last October aged 84, was never charged with any abuse offences.

Haut de la Garenne was called the 
'Jersey House of Horrors' after detectives said the remains of at least 
five children had been found there, alongside so-called punishment 
rooms.

But police have since admitted that the bone fragments may not be human, and could be hundreds of years old.

The abuse is alleged to have occurred between the 1940s and 1980s.
