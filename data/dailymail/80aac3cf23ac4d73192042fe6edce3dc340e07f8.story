A newspaper sales director who 'terrorised' a shopkeeper and ‘viciously’ smashed up an off-licence has managed to get his conviction successfully wiped from Google using the EU’s controversial 'right to be forgotten' ruling.

Patrick McVeigh and his older brother Terence, both from Leeds, admitted causing affray in 2001 and were jailed for nine months and ordered to pay £300 in compensation.

However, while the Leeds Crown Court case was widely reported in the media, the former newspaper sales boss has now managed to get record of his conviction wiped from the UK’s biggest search engine.

Patrick McVeigh, a former newspaper sales director who was convicted of affray in 2001, has successfully managed to get reports of his offence wiped from Google's UK search results under the 'right to be forgotten' 

McVeigh, who was 30 at the time, and his brother had been on their way to watch Leeds United at Elland Road in the Holbeck area in February 2001 when they walked into the off-licence, removed CCTV cameras and caused carnage – smashing up displays, throwing bottles of liquor and hurling a till to the ground.

The men, who were part of a much larger group, also contributed to causing injury to shopkeeper Dolat Patel who was left needing stitches when a bottle hit him in the lip.

The brothers were convicted after video footage taken outside the football ground identified them and was handed to police.

While reports of their convictions remained published online for many years, they have now been wiped from the search engine, the Daily Telegraph said, after McVeigh successfully used Google’s 'right to be forgotten' form - which lets people apply to get themselves removed from search results.

The ability to remove information from the site came into force in May after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice which said people were entitled to the 'right to be forgotten'.

It means people can have Google search results removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation.

Following McVeigh’s successful application in getting his conviction wiped from the site, a disclosure notice now appears in search results for his name.

Hundreds of thousands of people have requested links are removed from Google UK since the European Court of Justice's ruling in May. People can apply for results to be removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation

‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe,’ it states on Google.co.uk.

However, those using Google.com see no such message and reports of McVeigh’s conviction still appear on the site.

Since July 18, more than 91,000 applications have been made to the search engine requesting for links to be removed from Google’s European sites.

While Google said it was unable to comment on individual cases, it is understood more than 12,000 requests – involving 44,000 urls - came from the UK while around 17,500 – involving 58,000 urls -came from France.  

WHAT IS THE LINK?

Those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of Google's website. On this page, a form allows users to put in a search removal request under EU data law.

WHO CAN USE THE FORM?

Only EU citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears. They will have to explain why the link should be taken down.WHAT 

REQUESTS WILL BE CONSIDERED?

All requests will be considered but Google, but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest, the company has said it will not remove all cases.

WHAT CAN I DO IF A CASE IS NOT RESOLVED?

In Britain users can contact the Information Commissioner's Office or take Google to court.
