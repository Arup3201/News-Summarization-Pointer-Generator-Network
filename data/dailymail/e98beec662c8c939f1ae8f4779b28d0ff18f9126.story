Buy a bottle of Smirnoff and you will expect to get a high-quality vodka. But what’s in the bottle could cost you your life.

Britain’s shops are awash with counterfeit spirits made from lethal chemicals including chloroform and methylated spirits, an investigation has found.

The concoction is putting thousands of drinkers at risk of blindness, organ failure and even death.

Black Market Britain: An undercover investigation by Channel 5 infiltrated the crime gangs behind the trade and found one factory in east London producing bottles of fake Smirnoff. Others sold rip-off designer goods 

And because it is perfectly packaged, consumers have no way of telling the bottles from genuine brands.

An undercover investigation by Channel 5 infiltrated the crime gangs behind the trade and found one factory in east London producing 7,000 fake bottles of Smirnoff vodka a day.

The criminals use the latest machinery to repackage the bottles with perfect labels replicating leading brands.

And the trade is the tip of a counterfeit iceberg that includes rip-off designer handbags and clothing, and counterfeit cigarettes.

Paul Connolly, the journalist behind the investigation, managed to infiltrate some of the organised gangs behind the black market.

‘This is a huge and growing problem,’ he said yesterday. ‘And it is sinister, because the bottles are often filled with toxic chemicals. The bottles they make look so realistic they would be almost impossible to spot by an untrained eye.

'And given that the factory is producing on such a large scale, it’s almost certain they are being sold in supermarkets as well as smaller off-licences.’

Mr Connolly also found a thriving trade in counterfeit and smuggled cigarettes. The tobacco was packaged to look like leading brands such as Marlboro, but in some cases contained rat droppings and asbestos.

In Manchester, he uncovered a network of shops selling rip-off designer goods, including fake Armani, Mulberry and Gucci handbags and purses, and clothing with fake Adidas, Nike and Ralph Lauren logos.

Many of the clothes are imported from Pakistan, then have designer labels applied in warehouses guarded by bouncers and ‘spotters’ employed to watch for undercover policemen.

Mr Connolly said: ‘We all love a bargain and you don’t really think of the consequences, but this is going all the way up to organised crime and groups of gangsters.

‘People don’t really understand the gravity and the size and the scale of the black market here.’

Last month, it was reported that seizures of counterfeit alcohol by trading standards authorities had soared fivefold in five years. Fake goods reportedly cost the UK economy £1.3billion a year in lost profits and tax.
