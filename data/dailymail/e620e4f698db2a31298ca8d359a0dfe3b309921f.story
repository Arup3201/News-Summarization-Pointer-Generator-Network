Making a difference: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced all data will soon be encrypted after revelations unencrypted data was accessed by NSA spies

Web giant Yahoo announced Tuesday the details of a plan to encrypt all data flowing through Yahoo data centers.

Yahoo follows in the steps of Google, which moved to encrypt all data after it was revealed earlier this year that NSA spies were able to access unencrypted user information.

CEO Marissa Mayer wrote in a post to Yahoo’s Tumblr that most data should be encoded in 2048-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption within the first few months of next year.

Ms Mayer first took the opportunity provided by the announcement to assure users that ‘Yahoo has never given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency. Ever.’

An initiative announced earlier this year to make Yahoo Mail more secure through the use of SSL encryption will be complete by January 8 has now been extended across all other Yahoo products, Ms Meyer continued.

NSA spooks ‘hacked’ into Yahoo by accessing the unencrypted data flowing between data centers, that will be encrypted no later than March 2014.

The web portal will also make available to users to ability to encrypt all data flowing to and from Yahoo, as well as ensure that local co-branded variants of Yahoo mail are encrypted within the same time frame.

SSL encryption creates a secure link between both the user and, in this case, Yahoo. The connection allows information to travel only between designated parties and appears as unintelligible gibberish to anyone else.

2048-bit encryption is hard to crack because the security keys are 617 digits long, according to DigiCert, which estimated it would be virtually impossible for a desktop computer to break.

Google has encrypted user activity using SSL since at least 2011, Ars Technica noted.

‘There is nothing more important to us than protecting our users’ privacy… we appreciate, and certainly do not take for granted, the trust our users place in us,’ wrote Ms Mayer.
