Bradley Wernham started his life of crime at the age of 10

A man who burgled 700 properties in a £1 million crime wave and sparked a national outcry after a judge spared him jail has been caught red-handed yet again.

Bradley Wernham, who was 19 at the time the judge took pity on him, is thought to be one of the country’s most prolific burglars.

A judge decided to let him off if he participated in a ‘rehabilitation’ programme, but he was caught breaking into a house just three months later and sent to jail.

Now 23, and with an 18 month jail stint behind him, he has appeared in court yet again and has admitted new burglary offences for which he is facing further time behind bars.

News of the judge’s leniency caused a public row over soft justice after Wernham was spared jail, given a place on a taxpayer-funded rehabilitation scheme and handed a rent-free flat and training.

Just three months later, he repaid the judge who gave him a ‘second chance’ by breaking into another property.

He gave some indication of his intention to reform by posting the following message on Facebook just after he was jailed: ‘Be out in 18 months or before.. Yeeh is guna ride this s**t’.’

Wernham, originally from Harlow, Essex, started his life of crime aged ten and has since been branded one of Britain’s most prolific burglars.

When he originally appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex in October 2009, he admitted 17 burglaries and thefts and asked for 645 others to be taken into account.

The one man crimewave already had convictions for 26 other offences and he can now add at least four crimes to his tally, bringing his current tally to 672.

He targeted luxury cars, regularly breaking into properties, stealing the keys and making off with vehicles.

To avoid jail, he struck a deal with police that they would provide rehabilitation and he would identify the 645 properties that he had broken into in Harlow.

So Judge Christopher Ball, QC, let him walk free from court in October 2009 with a curfew and 150 hours of community service.

Wernham was also moved to Chelmsford where he was provided with a flat and training.

Two months later, he was caught driving without insurance but wasn’t charged. The following month, he broke into a home with a BMW parked on the drive.

Police were nearby as they had him under surveillance, after the number of burglaries in the area increased dramatically when he moved to the area.

Wernham admitted to his latest offending and will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court today

He appeared in front of the same judge, but this time Judge Ball dismissed his claims as ‘palpable nonsense’ and jailed him for five years, telling a smirking Wernham: ‘You cast yourself as a victim and you’re not. Until you are a man, or man enough to appreciate that fact, there will be little hope in you changing your conduct.’

He called Wernham a ‘prolific and successful burglar to which no shop, office, garden shed, garage, school or even house is safe’, adding: ‘Committing offences gives you a buzz, gives you an adrenaline rush, and you were pitting your wits against the police.’

Appearing at court yesterday, Wernham pleaded guilty via video link from prison to burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and attempted burglary.

In the latest crimes, he took car keys and laptops in a burglary in Harlow in April, caused damage to a £35,000 Mercedes in Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire, and attempted a burglary in Buntingford, also Hertfordshire, by entering a garden with intent to steal.

Wernham was remanded in custody and will be sentenced tomorrow.
