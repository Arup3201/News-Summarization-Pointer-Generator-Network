A British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance.

As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building.

There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.

The BA plane was out on a routine maintenance check when it collided with the hangar at Heathrow

There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally 

A BA spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'The tip of one of our aircraft's wings was damaged as it was being towed to our engineering base for routine maintenance.

'Our engineers are working to repair it. The aircraft will then be fully inspected before returning to service.

'Our flight schedule continues to run as planned.'

The crash didn't affect any BA flights out of Heathrow for passenger jets as the incident occurred away from daily flights in and out

The maintenance checks are carried out away from passenger terminals, and so there was no disruption to incoming or outbound flights.

BA's engineers have had a busy start to the week. At Glasgow Airport they were called into action when a plane was struck by lightning on landing.

The BA 2958 flight from Gatwick, that departed at 11.26am, then had to be chedcked by engineers once landed. 

This caused the return trip to Gatwick for the Airbus A319, scheduled for 1.30pm, to be cancelled, with passengers booked onto different flights.
