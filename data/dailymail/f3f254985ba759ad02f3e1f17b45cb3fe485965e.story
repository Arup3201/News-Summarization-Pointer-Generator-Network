An outspoken Conservative MP has been arrested on suspicion of rape.

Mark Pritchard, 48, went to a police station by appointment and was questioned by Scotland Yard detectives.

The backbencher was questioned for four hours over the allegation before being released on bail until next month.

His arrest was revealed in an online statement of proceedings at the House of Commons.

Mr Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, was arrested and questioned by police on Tuesday following an allegation that he raped a woman earlier this year

Details of the allegation were unclear but it is understood that the alleged rape was said to have taken place in central London in recent weeks.

Mr Pritchard is a prominent member of the Tory Right and a leading Eurosceptic who was secretary of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers.

He was at the centre of a political storm in 2010 when he told Commons Speaker John Bercow ‘You’re not f****** royalty’ after being told to stand aside in a Westminster corridor.

Yesterday, Mr Bercow was responsible for revealing Mr Pritchard’s arrest in the Parliamentary record Hansard under the title ‘Arrest of a member’.

The paper read: ‘Copy of a letter addressed to the Speaker … from the Metropolitan Police, relating to the arrest of Mark Pritchard, Member for The Wrekin.’

The disclosure came after police wrote to Mr Bercow to inform him of the arrest but did not say what it was for.

The 48-year-old announced last year that he was planning to divorce his U.S-born wife of 15 years, Sondra Spaeth (pictured together in 2005)

The short letter, marked ‘Confidential for Speaker only’ and ‘Not for further dissemination’, later emerged in the media.

It said: ‘I write to inform you that on 2nd December 2014, Mark Pritchard MP was arrested at 6.14pm at Holborn police station in London. Mr Pritchard was questioned by police and released on bail later the same evening at 10.16pm. The matter is subject to further investigation and is sub judice at the present time.’

Soon after, the Met confirmed that a 48-year-old man had been arrested on a rape charge.

Before his arrest, Mr Pritchard – the MP for the Shropshire seat of The Wrekin since 2005 – was in the House taking part in a debate on the peace process in Colombia.

The next day his official website published news of his visit to his constituency to boost support for grassroots football.

In September, Mr Pritchard said he had been targeted by a journalist in the sting that led to Tory minister Brooks Newmark resigning over explicit selfies.

He has apparently withdrawn a complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation after agreeing a settlement.

Mr Pritchard is unique among Tory MPs in being raised in an orphanage. From the age of five he was cared for by foster parents in a council house.

He left state school at 16 with few qualifications and worked as a labourer. But he studied hard to gain a masters degree before earning a six-figure salary as a marketing director.

He began his political career as a Tory councillor in Harrow before being elected to Parliament. He is on the joint national security strategy committee, which considers the threat from terrorism, cyber war, global military crises and natural disasters. 

The arrest was made public on a Commons order paper, which referred to a letter sent to speaker John Bercow by the Metropolitan Police, confirming Mr Pritchard's arrest 

The 48-year-old voluntarily attended a police station in north London and was bailed to a date in early January

Mr Pritchard has called for more working-class MPs to be promoted by David Cameron and said people who ‘went to school in a Morris Minor rather than a Jaguar’ would have avoided the ‘pasty tax’ gaffe in the 2012 Budget – a proposal to put VAT on hot takeaways.

But he ended any hopes of a ministerial career in 2011 by publicly accusing Mr Cameron of trying to bully him into dropping his call for a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses.

The MP had an acrimonious split from his American-born wife Sondra last year, in which she accused him of dumping her by text after 16 years of marriage. Commons records show he still employs her as his office manager. 

Mark Pritchard is one of Parliament's most-colourful MPs – a self-made businessman who grew up in an orphanage before entering the Commons in 2005.

The Tory backbencher is one of the party's most Eurosceptic MPs and admitted that he came close to joining UKIP earlier this year.

Since his election almost a decade ago, Mr Pritchard has been involved in a series of high profile political clashes – including with the Prime Minister.

During the 2005 leadership election he asked David Cameron if he had ever taken a Class A drugs.

He was also briefly the toast of the Tory backbenches after taking on Commons speaker John Bercow – shouting at him that he was 'not f****** royalty'.

It came after Mr Bercow demanded the MP step out of his way in a Commons corridor.

Mr Pritchard was also involved in a bitter public dispute with his wife last year after announcing that he was divorcing her.

The Tory MP was accused of telling his wife that he wanted a split by text message.

Sondra Pritchard used the MP's Wikipedia page to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'.

Shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the Pritchards' tit-for-tat Wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events.

His friend Tory MP Mark Garnier said: ‘I last saw him on Tuesday when he was arrested.

‘These are incredibly serious allegations. Clearly, he must answer to the rule of law.’

A Tory spokesman said: ‘This is a police matter. It would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation is taking place.’

Last year, Mark Pritchard and his estranged wife became embroiled in a row on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage.

In July 2013, Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, allegedly used the website to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'.

Under 'spouse' it refered to his wife by her maiden name of Sondra Spaeth and added that divorce was pending.

Shortly afterwards the entry was deleted. But a tit-for-tat Wiki war ensued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events.

Most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both worked at the time – Mrs Pritchard as her husband's Commons office manager.

Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appeared to involve a code which echoed opera buff Mr Pritchard's role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group.

One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.

In a statement, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her 'in person'.

He said: 'I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text.

'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.'

The 'text' claim was added to Mr Pritchard's profile on August 1: 'The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.'

Mr Pritchard's fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000.  

The only mention of his wife of the Wikipedia page now reads: 'In July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013.'
