Imagine being able to devour a slab of chicken terrine, lashings of mayonnaise and creamy pavlova drenched in double cream without feeling guilty.

Now you can, according to a controversial new diet book that's topped best-seller lists in America.

Nina Teicholz, an American journalist, debunks the nutritional myth that saturated fat is bad for you in her new book, The Big Fat Surprise, which lands in the UK this week.

Can eating cream be GOOD for you? A new book called The Big Fat Surprise by Nina Teicholz, an American journalist, debunks the nutritional myth that saturated fat is bad for you

Her best-selling book comes at the same time as new research, which questions the long-held belief that cardiovascular disease is related to high fat and cholesterol intake. 

'For decades, we have been told that the best possible diet involves cutting back on fat, especially saturated fat, and that if we are not getting healthier or thinner it must be because we are not trying hard enough,' she says. 

'But what if the low-fat diet is itself the problem? What if those exact foods we’ve been denying ourselves - the creamy cheeses, the sizzling steaks - are themselves the key to reversing the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease?'

She documents how the past sixty years of low-fat nutrition advice has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population, with disastrous consequences for our health.  

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, she said: 'There has never been solid evidence for the idea that these [saturated] fats cause disease. 

'We only believe this to be the case because nutrition policy has been derailed over the past half-century by a mixture of personal ambition, bad science, politics, and bias.'

Her new tome, which is packed with notes and citations based on decades of nutrition research and a nine year investigation on her part, was inspired by her own journey as a food critic.

Keep the fat ON, says Teicholz: She argues that the original hypothesis  that saturated fats raise your total cholesterol and cause heart attacks is not true. 'Saturated fats do cause total cholesterol to go up but your total cholesterol is not a good predictor of your heart attack risk,' she writes

Slather on the butter: Her new tome, which is packed with notes and citations based on decades of nutrition research and a nine year investigation on her part, was inspired by her own journey as a food critic where, she claims, she lost 10lbs by eating a diet high in saturated fat

Speaking to The Sunday Times, she explains that when reviewing rich and creamy dishes for years in her role as a food reviewer, she actually lost 10lbs and her cholesterol levels improved.

Best-seller: The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet is a best-seller in America and lands in the UK this week

'Saturated fat was condemned based on very early, now antiquated notion of cholesterol,' she explains.

'The original hypothesis was that saturated fats raise your total cholesterol and cause heart attacks. This is not true. Saturated fats do cause total cholesterol to go up but your total cholesterol is not a good predictor of your heart attack risk.'

Just as your body has requirements for cholesterol, it also needs saturated fats for proper function and she argues that there's two types of cholesterol and one of them actually helps the body.

She claims that whole milk is better for you than skimmed milk because the fat within it helps absorb vitamins A and D. Plus, she says, it's lower in sugar and when manufacturers take the fat out of skimmed milk, they replace it with carbohydrates. 

Teicholz's main point is that the low-fat craze that's gripped the world for years has resulted in excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates, which have caused increased inflammation and disease. 

She explains how carbs turn into glucose in our body and becomes a long-term fat deposit making them, not fat, the main enemy in our diet.

Obviously, not everyone agrees with her theory. 'Putting saturated fats back at the centre of our diet would be a tragic mistake,' Dr David Katz, a nutritionist and academic at Yale University told the paper.

'There is no diet that is mostly meat, butter and cheese anywhere is the world that is associated with good health outcomes. A healthy diet still features all the usual suspects: vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, wholegrains. Optional is fish, seafood, dairy and lean meats. But it reliably excludes saturated fats.'
