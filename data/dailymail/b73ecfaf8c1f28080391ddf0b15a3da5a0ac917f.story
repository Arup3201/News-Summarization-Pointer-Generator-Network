A fat chunk of metal crashed into a Seattle family's home Sunday out of the clear blue.

Sky, that is. The three-pound piece of lead smashed clear through a Seattle, Washington family's roof and left a shoe box-sized hole in their ceiling.

No one was injured, but the family and authorities are scratching their heads wondering where it could have come from.

Surprise! A family was shocked Sunday when this chunk of lead smashed through their roof and into their Seattle home

Though the incident happened over the weekend, the family waited until Tuesday to call the police.

A responding officer inspected the hole and decided one of two things happened.

Either the rectangular hunk of lead fell off an aircraft or, the officer said, 'a really big bird that had stolen a lead bar.'

However, the FAA has nixed the first possibility.

Damaged: The lead bar left a shoe box sized hole in the roof of their South Seattle home

'The FAA has concluded its investigation into the metal part that was found in the South Seattle home,' FAA spokesperson Allen Kenitzer told MailOnline.

'After examining the part, investigators have concluded that this object did not come from an aircraft.'

So where did the offending metal piece originate?

A bird? Police said it likely came form a plane, but the Federal Aviation Administration concluded 'this object did not come from an aircraft'

The only clues are two holes in the bar, as if to accomodate bolts, and an only partially readable serial number.

King 5 News reports that viewers in Seattle responded to the story and many seemed to believe the bar is a wood chipper tooth.

While someone is grinding wood and tree stumps, they said, it's possible for a 'tooth' to fly out along with the wood chips.

Chipping in? Viewers of a local news station that ran the story wrote in with a different possibility. They said the hole was made by a grinding 'tooth' from a wood chipper
