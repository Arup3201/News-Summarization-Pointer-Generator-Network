A man who swallowed two live goldfish as part of a NekNomination stunt told RSPCA inspectors they were pieces of carrot, a court has heard.

Ben Elphick, 23, filmed himself stripping down to his boxer shorts and preparing a cocktail of vodka, tequila and pre-mixed snowball at his home in Plymouth.

He then held up a plastic bag with a live goldfish swimming around in it, before pouring the fish into the glass.

Preparation: The 23-year-old stripped down to his boxer shorts and prepared a cocktail of vodka, tequila and pre-mixed snowball (left) at his home in Plymouth. He then held up a plastic bag with a live goldfish in it (right)

After
 downing the cocktail, the supermarket worker then picked up his 
baseball cap from the kitchen table, revealing a second fish in a glass 
of water.

Within
 seconds, Elphick had swallowed both water and fish, before belching and
 nominating three friends to take part in the online drinking challenge.

The video, which he later uploaded to YouTube, sparked concern among members of the public, Plymouth Magistrates' Court heard.

But when questioned by RSPCA inspectors, Elphick claimed the fish were actually pieces of carrot.  

'Unnecessary suffering': Elphick is captured cutting the fish out of its bag, before pouring it into the glass

'Game': The supermarket worker then downed the cocktail (pictured), while sporting a pair of purple boxers

However, he has now been disqualified from keeping fish for five years after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the two creatures.

RSPCA 
inspector Jo Pearson said: 'Although the defendant had tried to argue 
that he had substituted the first goldfish for a carrot through sleight 
of hand and held the second under his tongue until the camera stopped, 
careful analysis showed that this was not the case.

'A vet report advised that the fish would be unable to breathe in the alcohol and would rapidly become distressed. After
 being swallowed, the high stomach acid would create a totally 
unsuitable environment for the fish that would in time lead to death.

Another fish: After downing the cocktail, Elphick picked up his baseball cap from the kitchen table, which revealed a second fish in a glass of water (left). Within seconds, he had swallowed both water and fish (right)

'Eating a live animal and posting a video of it online for entertainment is not acceptable. These
 fish would have suffered needlessly as part of this "game" and we take 
the issue of animals used in these challenges very seriously.'

The 
NekNominate craze, which is thought to have originated in Australia, has been
 heavily criticised by alcohol awareness charities for promoting 
dangerous levels of binge drinking.

The drinking challenge has claimed at least five lives in the past year.

Guilty: When questioned by RSPCA inspectors, Elphick claimed the fish were pieces of carrot.  However, he has now been disqualified from keeping fish for five years after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the fish

In February this year, Stephen Brookes, from Rumney, Cardiff, died after downing almost a bottle of vodka during a NekNominate stunt.

The 29-year-old rugby fan had been six-times over the drink-drive limit when he collapsed after drinking more than a pint of the spirit 'in seconds' while being filmed by a friend.

At an inquest last month, his distraught family blamed the online craze for his death.

Elphick has also been fined £400 and ordered to pay £1,090 in costs.
