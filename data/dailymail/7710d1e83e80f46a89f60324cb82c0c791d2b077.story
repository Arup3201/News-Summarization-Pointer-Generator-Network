At Manchester United, they were calling him 'Mandela' by the end, such 
was the young man's act of insubordination towards manager Sir Alex 
Ferguson.

It certainly was not an oversight that Paul Pogba's
 name barely earned a mention in Ferguson's recent autobiography. 
Ferguson's silence spoke volumes.

Pogba did not challenge racial divisions and he will not have stadiums or museums named after him as the great South African Nelson Mandela did but his uncompromising defiance of a repressive manager spoke loud in the United dressing-room. They knew this was a player that should be taken seriously.

On the BBC on Monday evening, Rio Ferdinand revealed an anecdote that provided an insight into the confidence, bordering on arrogance, of this young footballer: 'He told me minutes before he left "I want to be the best player in the world." I don't know if he'll be the best player in the world, but I think he'll definitely turn out to be the best midfielder in the world.'

The story is well-told by now but United refused to offer the terms that Pogba and perhaps more crucially, his agent Mino Raiola, demanded. It was not money alone that decided Pogba's decision.

He simply felt that United did not believe in him, a view confirmed on a
 New Years Eve in 2012. United were crippled by an injury crisis but 
victory should still have been relatively straightforward against 
Blackburn of the Steve Kean incarnation.

As it 
transpired, United lost the match 3-2 at Old Trafford. Ferguson selected
 a strange midfield, choosing Park Ji-Sung and Rafael Da Silva in the 
central midfield positions. One week later, Paul Scholes had been 
invited to come out of retirement. Pogba never did start a game for the 
club.

Speak to those at Old Trafford and they now recognise a
 gross error of misjudgement, although it should be said that those 
voices were rather less dissenting at the time. The tone eighteen months
 ago was one that reproached a young upstart for questioning the 
knowledge of Ferguson.

Now, however, there can be no 
arguments. Pogba is making the greatest British manager of all-time 
appear rather foolish. Ferguson's refusal to offer him the wage package 
he desired can be filed in the calamity catalogue that wears labels such
 as 'Taibi', 'Djemba-Djemba' and 'Prunier'.

Once again 
for France on Monday evening, Pogba served notice of his status as the 
planet's most complete young midfielder. He is only 6 foot 2 inches but 
he seems taller, wider and stronger. In domineering form at this World 
Cup, he has towered across the global football landscape, a tackler that
 turns 50/50's into 80/20's and a midfield beast allaying flawless 
technique with a brutal physique.

One French newspaper 
last year described him as an 'NBA athlete with Brazilian feet'. Pogba 
is dancing to the Samba beat in Brazil, taking on opponents, shoving 
them aside with a scornful disregard as he drives his team-mates up the 
pitch.

It is why Juventus feel within their right to request a fee 
beyond Â£60million before they even begin negotiating with clubs such as 
Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United this summer. They see 
something in Pogba that goes beyond the norm, a truly special 
footballer.

Those at United saw a leader with fierce 
determination in Pogba and anybody that has witnessed the French team at
 this World Cup will have identified the Juventus midfielder as an 
obvious candidate for the national team captaincy in years to come.

And
 who knows, if he can pull this French team all the way in Brazil, there
 may prove to be something rather prophetic about the 'Mandela' nickname
 that they gave to a pretentious teenager at Old Trafford two years ago
