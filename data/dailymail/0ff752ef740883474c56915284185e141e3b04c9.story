The United States has sent F-22 stealth fighter jets to join South Korean military exercises in a show of support for Seoul as it urged North Korea to restrain itself from making threats against the South and its allies.

Yesterday, the North's top decision-making body said nuclear weapons are 'treasure' and the
'nation's life' and will not be traded for billions of dollars, the 
latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state.

'[North Korea] will achieve nothing by 
threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and
undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in 
north-east Asia,' the US said in a statement.

Sabre-rattling on the Korean peninsula also
drew a plea for peace from Pope Francis, who in his first Easter Sunday
address called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

'Peace in Asia, above all on the 
Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of 
reconciliation grow,' he said.

After the North's young leader Kim Jong-un chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling Worker's Party central committee yesterday, a statement to the official KCNA news agency said the country's nuclear weapons 'are neither a political
bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to 
the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at 
forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself'.

On Saturday, North Korea said it was entering a 'state of war' with South Korea but the statement was played down by Seoul and the US as the latest piece of 'tough talk' from Pyongyang.

Tensions have been high on the Korean peninsula since Kim ordered its third nuclear weapons test in February, breaching United Nations sanctions and ignoring warnings from China, its closest ally, not to do so.

The test drew further UN and bilateral sanctions designed to pressure North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. Instead, Pyongyang has responded with a campaign of threats, including a vow to launch nuclear weapons at the United States, and a series of warnings.

An unknown number of radar-evading F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base, the main US Air Force base in South Korea, from Japan to take part in the annual joint Foal Eagle military drills, which prepare the allies to defend the South from a North Korean attack.

On Thursday, the United States performed a rare show of force aimed at the North by dropping dummy munitions from two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers on practice runs over South Korea, which led to Kim putting the North's missile units on standby to attack American military bases in the South and the Pacific.

The two Koreas have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950-53 conflict.

Despite the threats from the North, few believe Pyongyang will risk near-certain defeat by restarting a full-scale war.

Analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts 
to provoke softer policies toward Pyongyang from a new government in 
Seoul, to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get more aid for the North 
and to strengthen the young North Korean leader's image and 
military credentials at home.

Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga condemned North Korea for 'aggressive provocation' after Kim's ruling party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, identified US military bases in Japan as targets for attack.

Pyongyang justifies its own nuclear pursuits largely on a perceived threat from the US.

The White House says the United States 
is taking North Korea's threats seriously, but has also noted 
Pyongyang's history of 'bellicose rhetoric'.
