Sir Chris Hoy today proudly tweeted his first picture of baby son Callum who was born 11 weeks early.

The six-time Olympic champion became a dad for the first time when his wife Sarra, 33, gave birth to Callum last month.

The 38-year-old sportsman delighted his Twitter followers by uploading a snap of baby Callum in his hospital cot.

Sir Chris wrote: 'Thanks for all your messages for Callum. He's doing well so far and says hi!' 

Mrs Hoy retweeted the photograph and told her followers: 'The messages of support we've received about Callum mean so much. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. They have really, truly helped.' 

Sir Chris had previously shared a picture just showing Callum's tiny hand clutching his finger and alongside it he wrote: 'Although v. early days for wee Callum, he's doing well as is Sarra. Huge thanks to incredible medical staff.'

Fellow Olympic gold-medallist Rebecca Adlington was one of the first to respond when Sir Chris uploaded the touching photo.

She tweeted: 'awww so tiny but so cute. Glad he's doing well x'

Sir Chris married Sarra, a lawyer, (both pictured) in 2010 and announced they were expecting their first child on June 25

Sir Chris had taken to Twitter to confirm the birth of his 'beautiful baby son' on October 15 and admitted he was 'a little shocked' with the early arrival who was born 11 weeks early.

He said: 'Amazed, delighted & a little shocked to announce the birth of our beautiful baby son, Callum David Robert Hoy! Born at 29weeks, today at 2pm.'

The sporting pro recently spoke of his excitement about becoming a father for the first time.

He said: 'I think maybe I'm just blindly optimistic that it's going to be great fun and dead easy. I'm sure it won't be, I'm sure there'll be lots of tough things but I'm just very excited. It all seems to have happened at the right time.'

Sir Chris married lawyer Sarra in 2010 and announced on Twitter that they were expecting their first child on June 25. 

Since retiring from cycling last year, the star has taken up motorsport with plans to compete at the 24-hour Le Mans race in 2016.

He has also started his own bicycle company and is acting as an ambassador with various charities including the Royal Air Force Air Cadets.
