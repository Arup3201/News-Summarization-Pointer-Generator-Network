Bieber's fourth taxpayer funded attempt to have his security downgraded was described as 'absurd' by a judge

A judge has dismissed a cop killer’s attempt to move to a cushier prison cell as an ‘absurd’ waste of public money.

David Bieber, 48, who shot PC Ian Broadhurst in cold blood, demanded to have his security category downgraded despite being one of Britain’s ‘most dangerous’ inmates.

At the High Court today, Mr Justice Mostyn dismissed his claim as ‘completely untenable’ and designed to make his life in prison a ‘little more comfortable’.

It is the fourth time the ‘bestial’ former US marine has used legal aid to sue the prison service for breaching his human rights and his claims have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds.

Last night, PC Broadhurst’s widow said it was ‘disgusting’ that her husband’s murderer was able to sue the prison service and branded him a ‘drain on society’.

Speaking from her home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, Eilisa Broadhurst said: ‘I’m very glad the judge threw the case out as I think he’s a drain on society. It’s not right that a convicted murderer can get legal aid to fund this.

‘It’s a blight on my husband’s memory that he has chosen to do this. It’s been more than ten years since my husband was murdered and he is preventing me from moving on with my life.’

Bieber shot the injured traffic policeman at point blank range as he begged for his life outside a betting shop in Leeds on Boxing Day 2003.

Describing his crimes as ‘bestial’ yesterday, Mr Justice Mostyn criticised his use of legal aid.

‘Since his incarceration, Bieber has occupied himself by making numerous applications to the High Court about the conditions in which he is being held,’ he said.

‘All of the claims he has made have been funded by legal aid,’ said the judge, who normally sits in the family courts.

‘It is perhaps noteworthy that I have sat in this court, where I usually sit, with litigants in person before me - people who are desperate to see their children - from whom the Government has withdrawn all legal aid.’

Bieber entered the UK in 1996 using the stolen identity documents of a dead child while on the run from the authorities in his native US.

Police approached him on Boxing Day, 2003, after spotting that his false numberplates and he opened fire as they tried to arrest him.

Traffic officer PC Broadhurst was shot in the back and fell to the ground. He ‘pleaded for his life’ as Bieber approached, but the cold-blooded killer shot him in the head.

Bieber was convicted of murder and given a ‘whole life’ sentence at Newcastle Crown Court in December, 2004.

However, his minimum term was later reduced to 37 years.

The murderer has been held in maximum security conditions ever since but has used legal aid to launch a series of legal challenges to improve his life behind bars.

‘This truly was a bestial crime,’ Mr Justice Mostyn said, describing the remarks of the judge who jailed Bieber as ‘sobering reading’.

Philip Rule, for Bieber, argued that the killer’s right to a fair hearing had been violated.

But, dismissing his challenge, the judge said: ‘The offence here was at the upper end of bestial. For someone to have committed such a grievous crime he must have no control over when he has normal human contact.

‘It is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that somebody who has committed a crime as grave as this, and who has accepted in no respect at all the reason for his incarceration, would make every effort to escape from prison at the first opportunity.

‘The murder offence here must loom large in any judgment as to whether David Bieber is a high escape risk.’

He concluded: ‘The arguments that have been put forward in this case are completely untenable. Indeed, I would characterise them as absurd.’

Bieber’s earliest possible release date is set for 2041 and he would almost certainly be extradited to the US if he is ever freed from prison.

He is considered to be ‘one of the most dangerous people currently in the prison system’.

But he claims his status as a category-A exceptional-risk prisoner, which restricts his movements within County Durham’s high-security Frankland Prison, breaches his human rights.

His security categorisation means he has to move cell every 28 days and change wing every three months, alongside other tight restrictions.

Earlier this year found to be unfit for a security downgrade due to the ‘nature of his offending’, fears that he had ‘access to finances, resources and/or associates that could assist with an escape attempt’ and due to his very long sentence. He has attempted two prison breaks.
