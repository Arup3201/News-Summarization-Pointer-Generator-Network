Steve Way has been selected to run the marathon for England at the Commonwealth Games in July.

But when the 40-year-old lines up next to his competitors it will mark another memorable chapter in a journey that has seen him transformed from an overweight smoker with a penchant for takeaways into an athlete who runs 130-140 miles a week while holding down a job in a bank.

He came to the attention of many when he entered the 2014 London Marathon and was the third British competitor to finish behind Mo Farah and Chris Thompson.

Turnaround: Steve Way was 16 stone and smoked 20 a day, now he's set to run for England in Glasgow 

A time of 2.16.27 saw Way finish within the two hour 17 mark and become eligible for selection for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, something which seemed a million miles off even recently.

Way told The Guardian: ‘I am a one-man band: a self-coached club runner.

‘At school I was the guy who hid in the bushes with my fat mate during the first lap of the cross country and then rejoined the field when they came round again.

‘I have never competed in a major championship before and until recently I had almost no contact with British Athletics. And now I will be running at the Commonwealth Games.’

Way's lifestyle has changed dramatically in the seven years since he decided to take up running as a means of getting fit and losing weight.

Way said: ‘Towards the end of 2007 I could hardly sleep at night. I was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife too.

‘At that point half our meals were takeaways and I would eat chocolate and sweets all the time.

‘I was 16 1/2 stone and realised I had to do something radically different to break the cycle.’
