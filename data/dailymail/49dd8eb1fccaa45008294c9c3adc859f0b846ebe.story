Hundreds of California parents are outraged over a ninth-grade health textbook including references to sexual anatomy, vibrators, oral sex, bondage, and where to purchase and use a condom.

'Your Health Today' is 392 pages covering everything from fitness to nutrition, but the sections on sex have so disturbed people that roughly 600 of them have signed a petition calling for the Fremont school board to cease teaching students from the book. 

'I feel that it's not age appropriate for  these kids,' mother Asfia Ahmed told SF Gate. 'I have read the book from
 first page to last, and most pages talk about college kids. It doesn't 
relate to these kids at all.'

The book is used on health classes for approximately 2,400 students, including Ahmed's to sons. 

Ahmed
 has gone so far as to contact faith-based parent's rights organization 
the Pacific Justice Institute over potential legal action to keep 
students from viewing the pages devoted to 'sexual response' which 
includes the difference between 'excitement,' 'plateau,' 'orgasm,' and 
'resolution.'

'I
 was shocked when I looked at the book the first time," he said. 'I am 
willing to pursue legal action, and I have other parents willing to 
support me on this.'

Ahmed said he wrote to the book's author, who assured him ninth graders were too young to read it.

'She said the target audience was college freshman,' Ahmed told CBS San Francisco.

Still others believed the information was fine for their children.

'The information in there is factual,' Becky Bruno, the mother of a 13-year-old-boy about to start ninth grade, told NBC Bay Area. 'There’s nothing in there that’s going to make him
 go exploring more than they have access to on their smartphones or 
Internet. Nothing made me feel that it was inappropriate.'

District
 officials acknowledge that some of the information is more advanced, 
but that it's imperative students learn about it before it's too late.

State
 standards for issues that must be addressed in health include puberty, 
STDs, hygiene, sanitary products, and athletic supporters.

'Yes, it talks about masturbation,' school board President Lara Calvert--York told SF Gate. 'We really want 
them to have a safe place to get facts about their bodies and how to 
handle things and how they need to be mature to deal with these things.'

The district's health teachers had a choice of half a dozen textbooks, and voted unanimously to select 'Your Health Today.'

The book was then agreed upon by the school board in a 3-2 vote.

They
 added that beyond simply the sexual information, the books brings 
students far more up-to-date than the decade-plus textbook it replaced, 
addressing e-cigarettes, gay marriage, and offering more current 
information.

Fremont school board members say the book provides valuable information to students before it's too late to be of use

'I
 want to let everyone know, if you think sex isn't happening with your 
freshmen, you need to take your blinders off,' said campus supervisor Michele Hartmangruber. 'It's happening, and it's 
happening in the corners, in the bathrooms, in the cars, in the parks 
and even on the 50-yard line in front of everyone.'

Though a health class is a requirement for graduation, parents can still opt out of the sexual education aspect.

Besides the sexual content, the book has garnered controversy for discussing drinking and alcohol poisoning.

'It 
may be that it is early for some students, but that's when we want them 
to have the information: before,' said board member Ann Crosbie told SF Gate.
