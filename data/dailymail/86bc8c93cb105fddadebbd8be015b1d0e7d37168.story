A family's front room has been destroyed after a car ploughed into the side of their house while two of them were asleep upstairs.

Trisha Rafferty, 45, was near her front door in Wigan, Greater Manchester when the blue VW Golf lost control and smashed into her family home while husband Stephen, 49, and son Sean, 22 were in bed.

The mother-of-two returned from walking her dog at 5am on Friday morning to see her fireplace and gable end wall in pieces on the floor.

Ruined: Trisha Rafferty, 45, arrived back at her home in Wigan Greater Manchester, her living room destroyed after a car smashed into the side of the house while her husband and son were asleep

She also described how her television had been flung across the room due to the impact of the collision, and was discovered lying upside down on the pile of rubble. 

'I was out walking the dog and when I got back my son was outside,' Mrs Rafferty said. 'He just looked at me and said to have a look at the living room.'

'I went round and I saw the car was stuck in the wall on the gable end of the house. It’s just lucky that it happened at 5am when no-one was in the living room. If anyone had been in there who knows what would have happened.

'It’s a notorious spot for accidents so clearly something needs to be done about it.'

Her daughter Sinead, 25, was working a night-shift at the time of the smash and Trisha described her relief that the crash happened when nobody was downstairs.

She said: 'My husband Stephen told me he heard a really loud bang and that he felt the house shaking when it happened.

Destruction: The fireplace caved in during the impact and the television was flung across their front room

'I couldn’t believe the damage it had caused when I went inside - it was so bad that the TV was on the other side of the room.

'The whole fireplace was demolished and needs rebuilding. The wall had collapsed on the inside and debris was been fired across the room.

'We’ve had the wall patched up just to get us by but the gable end needs a lot of work but we’ve got no idea how much it’ll cost.'

Police breathalysed the driver of the car who sustained minor injuries but have taken no further action. 

Air bag deployed: The driver was breathalysed at the scene following the crash in the early hours of Friday morning - but police decided against taking any further action
