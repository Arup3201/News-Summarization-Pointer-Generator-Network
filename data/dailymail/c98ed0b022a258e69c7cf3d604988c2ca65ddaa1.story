Bradley Morcombe has vowed to keep his murdered twin brother close to his heart on his wedding day.

So much so, he and older brother Dean - who will be the best man - will pin a photo of Daniel and a red rose to their jackets during the ceremony.

The 24-year-old will walk down the aisle on Saturday to wed his schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin in what will be a big family celebration.

He will be there forever: Bradley Morcombe (pictured, left, with his twin brother Daniel) has said that although Daniel is gone, he is with him and his family every day

'Daniel will be watching from heaven, watching over the day, that’s for sure,' Bradley told the Courier Mail.

'Dean and I will be wearing a photo of him.'

Bradley first met Anna, now 25, whilst they both attended Siena Catholic College - where Daniel also studied.

The invitation-only ceremony will be held on the Sunshine Coast, south-east Queensland.

Family first: Denise and Bruce Morcombe said they were determined not to let the tragedy tear the family apart

The abduction of Daniel Morcombe (pictured, left) in December 2003 could have torn his family apart, but Bruce and Denise Morcombe were determined to keep their clan together, as they have detailed in their new book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' (pictured, right, with a framed photo of Daniel)

The day will be a testament to the positive thinking of the Morcombe family who refused to be torn apart by the tragedy of 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe's abduction and murder on December 7, 2003.

'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event,' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia on August 2 - the same day he and wife, Denise, launched their book, 'Where is Daniel? The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan.

'In the back of everyone's minds, there is where is Daniel, where is the twin? But it is Brad and Anna's day.

'There will be thoughts about Daniel. [You would have] expected him to be best man.

'But Dean [Bradley's older brother] will be the best man.'

While Bruce Morcombe said the ceremony will reflect the wider 'family' the Morcombes have acquired since Daniel went missing, through their long campaign to find him and the trial and conviction of murderer Brett Peter Cowan earlier this year.

Twins: When Bradley Morcombe (left), his father Bruce Morcombe says it will be natural for some people to think 'where is Daniel (pictured, right), where is the twin' but that the days will belong to the couple Bradley and his bride, Anna Martin

Bruce and Denise Morcombe's book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' is intended to help other families under stress or who have lost loved ones to hold together and not crumble in the face of adversity

Julie Elliott, a former police senior sergeant stationed at Caboolture, 40km north of Brisbane, was appointed as a special police media liaison officer exclusively to the Morcombe case; she retired from the police force to become a civil celebrant and will marry Bradley Morcombe and Ms Martin.

Kay McGrath, a Channel 7 Queensland journalist and presenter who covered the Daniel Morcombe case, will act as the wedding's MC.

Bradley Morcombe, who works as a fencing contractor, has previously told Australian Women's Weekly how he might have accompanied his twin brother on the Christmas shopping expedition that ended in Daniel's disappearance and murder by Cowan, which left the family in limbo as Denise and Bruce pursued answers as to what had happened to their son.

Priorities: Bruce and Denise Morcombe said finding their son Daniel, who was abducted and murdered by Brett Peter Cowan (pictured) in December 2003 was of huge importance - but so was keeping their family together, which they write about in their new book

Bradley told the Weekly there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of his brother.

'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future.'

Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia keeping their family together under such strains and pressures was one of his and Denise's great achievements, which he hoped to impart to other families suffering tragedy and loss.

'If the Morcombes can stay together, well so can others,' he said. 'The book ... is very much a survival of the Morcombe family, so that out experience will benefit other families.

'It was very much a concerted decision [for us] to be strong. You are very much aware through media reports how a significant life event almost always results in the family exploding.

'Because of crises [families] have disintegrated. People become depressed and some don't manage all that well.'

Mr Morcombe as much as he and Denise had been determined to find their son, in the early stages hoping to find him safe, and then to bring home his remains and the killer Cowan to justice, 'Where is Daniel - The Family's story' was about their other driving force.

'We made that very much known within the inner family ... that this will not tear us apart,' he said.

Mr Morcombe said he has watched on proudly as older son Dean and Daniel's twin, Bradley, have pass their life miletsones.

'They both have good jobs, a steady girlfriend and they've purchased houses.'

'I think holding the family together has been one of the highest priorities and of course finding Daniel.

'It wasn't easy. How do you put ona 21st party for Bradley and everyone thinks we should have two cakes, but you have to be realistic and celebrate the positive aspect.

'And we have all stuck together.'

Bradley Morcombe and Anna Martin both attended Siena Catholic College at Sippy Downs on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and live locally at Buderim.

'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' written with Lindsay Simpson, published by Pan MacMillan, is available from bookshops for $32.99.
