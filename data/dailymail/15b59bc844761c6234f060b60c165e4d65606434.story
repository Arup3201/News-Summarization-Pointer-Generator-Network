An artist was forced to have 25 stitches in each of her eyes after they both burst - with one splitting during a driving lesson.

Liz Hodgkinson, from Mold in Wales, was driving along a dual carriageway with her driving instructor when she began to suffer pain and having problems with her sight.

After being took back home, Miss Hodgkinson was then rushed to hospital where consultants discovered that her cornea had split and diagnosed her with Keratoconus, a degenerative eye disorder.

The 30-year-old explained: 'It was painful, but I just thought I had something in my eye.

'We were on the A55 dual carriageway at the time, so the instructor told me to get off at the next slip road. He took over the pedals and I kept steering as well as I could.

'The hospital patched me up and told me how to keep it clean.'

Miss Hodgkinson then had surgery on her left eye and was still recovering from the first operation when her right eye then burst five months later.

After having surgery on her left eye, five months later her right eyeball also split, meaning she had to have 25 stitches in each eye

She recalled: 'The second time I was watching a film.

'The consultants were stunned - it was the most severe case they had ever seen.'

She has since had cornea transplants in both eyes and was given 25 stitches in each eyeball during operations that each lasted for three and a half hours at Abergele Eye Hospital.

The artist added: 'Fortunately I was under general anaesthetic, otherwise I think I would have had a panic attack.

'It was quite an embroidery project for them.'

Most of the stitches have been removed but she now has four stitches in each eye, which may be left in place permanently.

Her condition is genetic and her mother and brother are both affected and they believe her great-grandfather, who used to wear an eye patch, also suffered from it.

Experts believe the degenerative disorder, which causes the front of the eyeball to thin and bend out of shape, affects between one in 500 and one in 2,000 people, but difficulties with diagnosis make it hard to give an accurate estimate.

The condition can cause distorted vision, including multiple images and streaking, as well as sensitivity to light, and is usually diagnosed in teenagers.

Miss Hodgkinson explained: 'I knew it could run in the family, so I was always aware of it, but I never realised my eye could actually burst.

Most of the stitches have now been removed and the 30-year-old now has four stitches in each eye, which may be left in place permanently. She is pictured after having surgery on her left eye 

Miss Hodgkinson has now had to re-learn her art techniques and adapt her style of painting after her vision was affected by her condition 

'My mum Sue suffered with the condition for 25 years, whereas for me, it happened out of the blue.'

As a professional artist, the 30-year-old depends on her eyesight to earn a living and has had to adapt her style of work.

She mostly works in oils and paints in the traditional Venetian style, which involves huge attention to detail.

'I am not able to see as well as I could and to some extent, I have had to re-learn my techniques and adapt my style', she explained

'I would not trust myself with portraits anymore because of the finer features of the faces.'

She now focuses on landscapes and has recently opened the Moss Piglet Art Gallery, in Ruthin, north Wales, with her friend Rachel Ilsley, who specialises in jewellery.

Keratoconus is a condition which causes the cornea in the eye to progressively thin, meaning a cone-shaped bulge develops.

It is a genetic disorder and is more common in people with asthma and Down's Syndrome.

The thinning and the change in shape of the cornea means the eye is often unable to focus and can therefore impair a person's vision.

If it is diagnosed early, treatment can include wearing glasses or contact lenses to correct vision.

In more severe cases, a cornea transplant may be needed.
