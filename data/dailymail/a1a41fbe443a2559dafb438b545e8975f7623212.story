Arjen Robben reacted angrily to a tough challenge from Holland team-mate Bruno Martins Indi during a World Cup training session at their base in Rio.

Robben kicked out at Martins Indi after one tackle and lay on the ground clutching his back after another strong challenge by the Feyenoord defender on Sunday.

Sent flying: Bruno Martins Indi angered Arjen Robben by putting in a strong tackle on the Bayern star

Hurt: Robben looked in pain after the incident but was fit enough to return later in the training session

Powerless: Louis van Gaal could only watch as his forward clashed with the Feyernoord defender

Flashpoint: Indi (left) accused Robben (right) of 'falling needlessly' during the session on Sunday

Strong challenge: Indi upset the Bayern Munich winger by challenging him strongly during the training session

The Bayern Munich winger briefly left the pitch but later returned and did not appear hurt.

He will be one of the key players as Holland look to go one better than they did in South Africa four years, when they lost to Spain in the final.

Martins Indi admitted afterward that the pair had clashed. Robben did not speak to the media.

'Arjen is a good dribbler. I thought he fell needlessly once,' Martins Indi said. 'We had a little head-to-head.'

A reporter said to Martins Indi that he 
thought he had seen irritation between the two, to which Martins Indi 
replied, 'You saw right.'

Reaction: Robben has often been accused of falling to easily and feigning injury before recovering quickly

Recovery: Robben was treated by medical staff on the pitch and in the changing rooms before returning

Key player: Robben was vital as Holland reached the 2010 World Cup final, and is a key part of their squad
