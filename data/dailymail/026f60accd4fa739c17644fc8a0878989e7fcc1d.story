New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has revealed his illustrious predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson rang him to congratulate the Dutchman on his new job.

And Van Gaal revealed that the pair, old adversaries in the past, will meet for a glass of wine and no doubt will discuss the club's future.

The former Holland manager said: ‘He (Sir Alex) called me to congratulate me and we have spoken about a cup of coffee.

‘We were always invited to UEFA (meetings) and we always did a night out with a glass of wine.‘So I will have a glass of wine, the better wine, with him.'

Like Ferguson, Van Gaal is a manager who knows his own mind but denies he has an autocratic personality - and says he shares with the former United boss a winning mentality.

He said: ‘(My reputation) is unfair. The media wants to show that side (of my personality).

‘From 39 I was head coach of Ajax and until now my personality has not changed. Autocratic and strong personality are not the same word, some people think it is.

‘Sir Alex also has a strong philosophy. He was always confirming that by winning a lot of titles.

‘I hope I can start with that philosophy.'
