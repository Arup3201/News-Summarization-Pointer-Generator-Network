This year sees the return of the popular Tiger Woods golfing games.

But rather than a just routine update, EA have crammed in loads of new features to make this Tiger's biggest outing yet.

In the all-new Legends of the Majors mode, you can play against the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Sam Snead and Lee Trevino.

And for the first time in franchise history, you can go for the Grand Slam by taking part in historical events from all four majors: the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, the Open Championship and the PGA Championship.

There are also 20 Championship courses available on disc, more than ever before.

Five new courses make their franchise debut, including Jack Nicklaus’s home course, Muirfield Village, home of PGA TOUR’s Memorial Tournament and Oak Hill Country Club, host course to the 2013 PGA Championship. 

The roster now features more than 35 playable characters. New additions include 2011 PGA Champion Keegan Bradley, Bud Cauley, Lexi Thompson and 2012 LPGA Player of the Year, Stacy Lewis.

The LPGA has rightly been given lots more attention, too. You can create your own golfer and set out to win the LPGA’s first Major of the 
season by playing on Mission Hills Country Club - the home
course of the Kraft Nabisco Championship. 

LPGA pros Paula Creamer, 
Natalie Gulbis, Stacy Lewis, Suzann Pettersen and Lexi Thompson join the roster of professional playable characters.

Day dream: The dynamic time of day system in action. You can even keep playing at night using illuminated balls

With the new dynamic time of day mechanic, you can tee off in the early evening and play into the night (with illuminated balls), and with more than 3,00 camera shots, presentation is on par with the real thing.

The game also full integrates the Xbox 360 Kinect into gameplay - tracking entire body movements to create the most advanced virtual golf swing to date.

The in-game swing recognition system for the Kinect scans more than 1,000 data points in real-time to recognise the player’s swing mechanics, to replicate your authentic swing.

It's released on March 28.
