Two Chinese sailors died and six are believed to be missing after their boat sank in the Pacific Ocean, an official at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base said Sunday.

Major Sarah Schwennesen said that a Venezuelan fishing boat reported finding 11 sailors floating in a raft Friday afternoon.

She said the Venezuelan crew said four sailors were badly burned. Two later died of their injuries.

Airmen from the 563rd Rescue Group 
parachuted into the water Saturday afternoon and used inflatable boats 
to reach the Venezuelan vessel, which is 1,100 nautical miles west of 
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Schwennesen said.

They treated the injured 
sailors Saturday and into Sunday morning.

The
 rescuers treated the sailors, who will be hoisted, along with the U.S. 
airmen, onto three helicopters Sunday and flown to Cabo San Lucas. The 
injured pair will then be taken in a different aircraft to a burn unit 
in San Diego, accompanied by the airmen giving them care.

The distance required to reach the 
sailors has been the most challenging, Schwennesen said. Because of an 
estimated six-hour flight that included flying over miles of ocean, a 
refueling aircraft was dispatched from the Arizona Air National Guard in
 Phoenix.

'The assistance of
 refueling by the 161st out of Phoenix was critical in providing faster 
care,' Schwennesen said. 'They could refuel over the Pacific Ocean 
rather than fly down to Mexico first.'

The
 Venezuelan boat had sent out a request for help around 5 p.m. Friday, 
and it was received by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center.
