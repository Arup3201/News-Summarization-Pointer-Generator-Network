Former Tory minister Lord Tebbit has said he can never forgive the IRA bomber who planted the Brighton bomb which left his wife paralysed.

Today marks 30 years since five people were killed and 34 seriously injured at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in an intended terrorist attack on Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet.

The then trade and industry secretary, Lord Tebbit was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care.

Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis narrowly escaped injury in the attack during the Conservative Party Conference on October 12, 1984.

Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb, was handed eight life sentences in 1986 but was released 13 years later under the Good Friday Agreement.

Lord Tebbit, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, said: ‘I am often asked if I can find it in my heart to forgive the creature, Patrick Magee. That is not possible, for Magee has never repented.’

Speaking to BBC News today he added: 'One can hope that there’s a particularly hot corner of Hell reserved for him and they can repent in his own time there.'

He continued: ‘Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it.

‘He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.’

But for the 83-year-old former RAF pilot, the anniversary is ‘just another day’ as he and his wife live with the injuries they sustained in the attack.

Lord Tebbit has said he will never be able to forgive the 'creature' Patrick Magee for the bombing

‘I think about it every day in the sense that I look at my wife who was sentenced to life imprisonment in a wheelchair,’ he said.

‘There is nothing really to celebrate, or mark, it just goes on.’

He adds that age has brought its own problems exacerbating the injuries he and his wife suffered.

He said: ‘There are only two alternatives. You either live with it or you die with it, and that's the way it is.’

Recalling the moment the bomb went off at 2.53am, he writes about the ‘indescribable pain’ and being buried in the rubble, reaching out for each other’s hand.

‘The chandelier swung wildly, the floor collapsed, and we were tipped out of bed into a pitchblack void.

‘I was able to call out for Margaret. We talked about our family as we drifted in and out of consciousness.’

He said that the attempted murder brought an ‘abrupt change’ in the couple’s lives after his wife’s spine was crushed and she was left paralysed.

The following day, the IRA claimed responsibility for the attack and released a statement, which said: 'Mrs. Thatcher will now realise that Britain cannot occupy our country and torture our prisoners and shoot our people in their own streets and get away with it. 

'Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no more war.'

Then and now: Patrick Magee, pictured left in the 1980s and right, in 2001, was given eight life sentences in 1986 but was released just 13 years later

In a statement, David Cameron said the anniversary was a timely reminder of Mrs Thatcher’s words at the time that ‘Britain will never be cowed by terrorists’.

Patrick Magee stayed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the weekend of September 14 to 17, 1984 under the pseudonym Roy Walsh.

He planted the bath in his room - number 629.

The device had been fitted with a long-delay timer made from components and a safety device. 

It detonated at 2.54am on October 12 when the midsection of the hotel collapsed into the basement. 

Margaret Thatcher was still awake at the time working on her conference speech for the next day. Her bedroom and sitting room were not damaged and the Prime Minister and her husband escaped without injury. 

They were driven to Brighton police station and she gave an impromptu interview to the BBC where she said the conference would still go ahead.

Five were killed including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry, North-West area chairman Eric Taylor, Lady Shattock (wife of the western area chairman), Lady Maclean (wife of Sir Donald Maclean) and Roberta Wakeham (wife of the Parliamentary Treasury Secretary).

The IRA claimed responsibility the next day and said it would try again.

On 24 June 1985 following investigations into who had stayed in the room, Patrick Magee was arrested in Glasgow. 

Four members of an IRA unit were also imprisoned for involvement in the plot.

He said: ‘It is a message we repeat today as we face down the threat from violent extremism, whether in the skies over Iraq or on the streets of our towns and cities.

‘As we remember today those killed and injured in Brighton, we must renew our vow that terrorism must never win.’

Bomber, Patrick Magee, will be in Brighton and Hove tonight to take part in a panel discussion following a screening of documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market.

The programme follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee.

The Conservative politician’s daughter has admitted she is friends with her father’s killer and now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Magee.

'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.'

Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago.

A solemn minute’s silence was held in Brighton today to mark the anniversary. 

The flag flew at half mast over the hotel as staff and members of the public gathered in the lobby for a minute’s silence to remember the injured and the dead.

The brief ceremony took place in front of a plaque marking the bomb’s 25th anniversary, which was unveiled by former Tory minister Lord Tebbit.

The Grand’s general manager, Andrew Mosely, said: 'The 60 staff who are on duty today gathered around the plaque that was unveiled by Lord Tebbit.

'I said a few words to pause and reflect and remember the five people who were killed and 34 injured, the guests at the hotel, members of the community, the emergency services and so many other people who were affected by what happened that night.

'Then we stood for the minute’s silence, which was conducted solemnly and correctly. Hotel guests joined us as well as members of the public, one of whom had bought a bunch of flowers to lay at the base of the plaque.

'It was the right thing to do, the bomb blast happened here and we should remember it and the reasons why it happened.

'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.'

The daughter of a Conservative politician who was murdered in the Brighton bombing 30 years ago has said she is friends with her father's killer.

Sir Anthony Berry MP was one of five people who died when the IRA explosion ripped through the Grand Hotel on October 12, 1984.

His daughter Jo now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Patrick Magee - the republican bomber who planted the deadly device.

'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.' 

Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago.

She added: 'I don't like to use the word (forgiveness). For me it is more about empathy and understanding. And the empathy is about understanding from his perspective why he did it.

'I am always going to be against any violence but if I understand why he, and others, chose to use violence then that can help me to look at how we can make the world a place where people are less likely to use violence.

'Forgiveness is such a difficult word. But he is my friend now. We spend a lot of time together.'
