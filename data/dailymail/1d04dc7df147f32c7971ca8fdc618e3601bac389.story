Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter has just one tournament left to qualify for this year's European team after failing to move into the automatic places in the US PGA Championship.

Poulter remains 12th in the standings after finishing joint 59th at Valhalla and will not change his schedule even if he fails to win enough points in the first FedEx Cup event next week.

'I'll play next week and if I play well enough then I'll be an automatic in,' said Poulter, who was one of the heroes of the 'Miracle at Medinah' in 2012. 'If not, it's up to somebody else.'

Doubt: Ian Poulter is in danger of missing out on Europe's Ryder Cup team following the US PGA Championship

European captain Paul McGinley will name his three wild cards on September 2.

The final qualifying event, the Italian Open, finishes on August 31 and the 40th Ryder Cup takes place from September 26-28 at Gleneagles.

The US PGA had little effect on the qualifying battle, with Jamie Donaldson moving from ninth to eighth after finishing joint 24th.

Graeme McDowell droped from eighth to ninth after claiming a share of 47th.

Luke Donald is less than two points behind McDowell in the standings and will join Poulter in trying to gain enough world ranking points via The Barclays at Ridgewood Country Club from August 21-24.

Options: European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley (second right) will name three wild cards on September 2

Lee Westwood held a share of the lead after the first round at Valhalla but could only finish in a tie for 15th and looks likely to have to rely on a wild card.

Scotland's Stephen Gallacher, who is 11th in the table, will play this week's Wyndham Championship on the PGA Tour along with the Czech Masters and Italian Open in a bid to qualify.
