A woman and her lover who accused a man of rape, carved the word 'whatever' into his flesh then killed him were sentenced to life in prison.

Jacqueline Cook, 30, confronted Mr Dance and inflicted the chilling wound on him, before her boyfriend Ian Gollop, 51, stabbed him to death.

The guilty pair were described as 'pure evil' by Mr Dance's father, who called the sentences at Plymouth Crown Court 'the right result'.

Mr Dance's beaten and throttled body was found with more than 70 stab wounds.

Sentencing,
 Mr Justice Burnett said the violence used was 'extreme' and a 
'calculated revenge attack' with a 'significant degree of planning and 
premeditation'.

Speaking 
after the verdict, Mr Danceâ€™s stepfather, Ron Flower, said: 'Cooke and 
Gollop are just pure evil. We have got the right result.'

Mr Justice Burnett imposed a minimum term of 17 years and 6 months on Gollop and 15 years on Cooke.

The
 court heard that Cooke claimed that Mr Dance had raped her, but after 
he shrugged off the accusation she stabbed him in the back of his head, 
cut his chest and slashed his throat.

Her boyfriend Ian Gollop then killed the alleged rapist by stamping on his head and throttling him.

Cooke, 30, admitted stabbing the victim but denied involvement in his killing, pinning the blame on Gollop, 51.

She claimed that Dance, 33, raped her at his flat in Plymouth and subsequently said he 'felt a lot of guilt about what had happened'.

She confronted the alleged rapist, who was a friend and drinking companion, but said he replied: 'Whatever - why are you going on about it?'

Dance was arrested and questioned by police after Cooke reported the alleged attack, but was released when he insisted the pair had had consensual sex.

Cooke - who said she drank between nine and 12 litres of cider a day - was arrested after attacking Dance with a knife, leaving him with cuts and scratches to his face.

Gruesome: Cooke apparently carved the word 'whatever' into her victim's chest

On March 10 last year, she and Gollop went to Dance's house, where she forced him to lift his shirt and carved the word 'whatever' into his chest in revenge for his dismissive words to her.

Gollop then punched him in the face several times, throttled him with a rope and stamped on his head, leading to his death from asphyxiation and beating.

Two days later, Cooke called 999 and told an operator she had killed Dance, saying she carried out the crime because 'she had been raped by him three weeks earlier'.

She told the operator she had 'lost the plot' and had left his flat and dumped the knife down a drain.

The killer added: 'I could not handle the fact that I had stabbed him. I am feeling really guilty and sick. It has been going over and over in my head and I am feeling so guilty for it now.'

However, in a police interview she denied any involvement in the murder, blaming Gollop - who pleaded guilty before his girlfriend's trial - and claiming she tried to stop the killing.
