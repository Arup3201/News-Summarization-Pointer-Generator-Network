Max Clifford attended sex parties hosted by Sixties siren Diana Dors and helped cover up other people’s orgies, a court heard yesterday.

The celebrity publicist admitted he cheated on his first wife with four women, and had sex in his office with one of them.

But he denied ever forcing himself on women, saying he had no need to. Accusations he molested children were ‘revolting lies’, he told Southwark Crown Court.

Jurors heard that the celebrity publicist told police the ‘Swinging Sixties’ were a wild time but he claimed his accusers were only after him because he was rich, famous and successful.

Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, denies 11 charges of indecent assault relating to seven females aged 14 to 20 between 1966 and 1984.

Giving evidence for the first time in his trial, the 70-year-old said that in his ‘younger days’ he went to parties thrown by movie sex symbol Miss Dors – a friend – where revellers would often pair off.

‘There were parties and sometimes there was sex, but they weren’t orgies. Not everyone went there and took their clothes off,’ he said.

‘In most of these situations they were one-bedroom premises, there was kissing, caressing and flirtation.’

However the millionaire PR expert, who took to the witness stand wearing a navy blue suit and white open-necked shirt and swore his oath on the Bible, said he did help cover up orgies elsewhere.

He told the court: ‘The sex orgies I have covered up over the years for other people were at different places in the West End, people’s homes.’

He revealed that he had affairs with two work colleagues and a five-year relationship with a TV dancer, named in court only as Vicky.

Clifford, who was married to his first wife Liz at the time, also had a ten-year liaison with a French fashion model named Anne Marie.He never hid the fact he was married.

‘I always said, “I love my wife”,’ he said. ‘I knew what I was doing was morally wrong. I didn’t think I would be found out.

‘Just about everybody I knew in the business was having affairs so it seemed pretty natural and normal.

‘Most of the women I had relationships with are still friends to this day.

‘I never, ever pretended I wasn’t married, I never, ever pretended I was leaving  my wife.’

Liz, whom he married in 1967 when he was 24, died from cancer in 2003. He has since remarried.

When he was arrested in December 2012, Clifford had told police of ‘slap and tickle, kissing and cuddling’ in his office but denied sexual intercourse had taken place.

'I never needed to boast': Clifford said he had affairs with four women, including a model and a TV dancer

Yesterday, he told the jury: ‘Did I ever have sex in my office? Yes, but with someone I was having an affair with.

‘As and when and if something happened in the office it would have been very, very occasional, spontaneous, after work with the doors locked. We went to hotels and motels, we went abroad.’

In interviews, he told police he was not a ‘grubby little whatsit’ who needed to use his fame and power to lure women, adding: ‘Because it was a different era, doesn’t mean to say I had to mislead women to have sex with them. I had personal pride in myself and ego.’

Asked by Richard Horwell QC, defending, if he had ever had sexual contact with a woman without consent, Clifford replied: ‘No.’

Asked if he had ever been sexually attracted to children, he said: ‘No, no. It is just revolting. It’s really revolting. Utterly untrue. Disgusting. Lies.’

Firm denial: Asked by his defence if he had ever had sex with a woman without consent, Clifford replied: 'No'

Clifford said the 1960s and 1970s was a time of sexual revolution in Britain and he had ‘open access’ to Top Of The Pops for 20 years. ‘If I really wanted to impress young girls, it would have been easy,’ he said.

‘There were young girls around pop stars all the time, waiting  at recording studios, television studios... trying to get into stars’ dressing rooms. That’s how  it was.’

His PR business would have been ruined if he had gained a reputation for touching women.

Mr Horwell told jurors that the prosecution case was undermined by conflicting evidence given by the alleged victims.

Denial: Clifford said he wasn't some 'grubby little whotsit' who needed to use his fame and power to get women.

Two women had said Clifford had a tiny penis, while a third had described it as enormous. But a doctor had examined him and said it was of average size.

Mr Horwell said that Clifford’s family members and former work colleagues would be called to prove that claims the publicist regarded his New Bond Street offices as his ‘sexual fiefdom’ were nonsense.

Several showbusiness stars would also give evidence on  Clifford’s behalf.

‘We do not intend to turn  this trial into a celebrity extravaganza but it is important for you to know that such publicity- sensitive personalities, some of whom will be witnesses, have not abandoned him,’ he said.

Asked about the first allegation of indecent assault, by a woman who claims he groped her in his car in 1966 when she was 14, Clifford said that at that time he could not drive and did not own a car.

The trial continues.
