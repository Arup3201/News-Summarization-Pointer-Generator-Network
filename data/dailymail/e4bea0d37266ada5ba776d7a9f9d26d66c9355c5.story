Do you have any idea how much sugar you're eating? It's probably a lot more than you think.

As this shocking graphic reveals, millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process.

While some culprits, such as Coca-Cola and ice cream are well known (and used here for comparison purposes), there are many other less obvious foods - such as pasta sauce, soup and so-called healthy granola - that are loaded with the white stuff.

For example, a 500g jar of Dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a Mars bar.

And Heinz tomato soup is on par with Bulmer's cider in the sweetness stakes, with five cubes.

Danger: As this worrying graphic reveals, millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process

Even a ‘healthy' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes. However the sugars in milk, vegetables and pieces of fruit (as opposed to fruit juice), including dried fruit, do not wreak as much havoc. 

So if you’re getting most of your sugar from these sources, you can eat up to 18 cubes daily.

More and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic.

It is the sheer quantity of sugar that we consume that creates the problem, says Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University.

‘Sugar calories slip down so easily and lead to weight gain.’

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks, but also those found naturally in honey, syrups and fruit juices. 

That equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink. 

However, the UN agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits. 

Yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this.  

A report published by the The World Health Organisation earlier this month revealed the current average intake of free sugars in North and Central America is 95g a day (19 cubes) rising to 130g (26 cubes) a day in South America.

Meanwhile in Western Europe the average is 101g (20 cubes).

Hidden health threat: A 500g jar of Dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a Mars bar. Meanwhile Heinz tomato soup is on par with Bulmer's cider, with five cubes.

With the global obesity crisis spiralling out of control, health experts are becoming increasingly vocal about the dangers of 'hidden sugar' in food.

Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Barts and The London Hospital, says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food, which consumers are largely unaware of, as it is mostly hidden. 

He said: 'Added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar, obtained from sugar cane, beet and corn, became very cheap to produce.

'It’s a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake: it has no nutritional value, gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the UK and worldwide.'

The two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup, a liquid sweetener made from maize.

Both are added to countless foods, turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma.

Sugars in fruit juices and honeys are also the unhealthy ‘added’ type.

‘Added sugars are more likely to do harm as they aren’t safely bound in the structure of a food, as they are in fruit,’ says Sasha Watkins, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.

‘It means they are available to the body in higher concentrations.’ 

He added: 'While it may not be surprising that a can of Coca-Cola has a staggering seven cubes of sugar (35g), similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods.'

These include flavoured water, yogurts, canned soup, ready meals and even bread.

Professor MacGregor also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour. 

'You might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt, but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar? A bowl of Frosties with semi-skimmed milk only has four.'

As Tam Fry, from  the National Obesity Forum, says: 'Stripping out fat from processed foods makes them less appealing to our taste buds. 

'The inevitable consequence is that manufacturers increase other ingredients, including sugar, to recreate taste and texture.'

Research also shows the huge toll sugar can take on our health.

Though we all need some sugar - it is the essential fuel that powers all cells in our body - excess levels have been linked with raised levels of the hormone insulin, which increases the risk of diabetes.

Furthermore, the body turns excess sugar into fat, which is stored around the major organs, placing us at risk of liver and heart disease.

There are also fears that high sugar diets may promote some cancers. The theory is that glucose, one of the main ingredients in added sugar, creates repeated spikes of insulin.

Even a ‘healthy' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes, while a Muller Light strawberry yogurt has 2.5

For reasons that are not clear, many tumours seem to have insulin receptors, hence a rise in this hormone fuels their growth.

A large population study in the US showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease.

That was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar, independent of other risk factors including weight. 

Professor MacGregor believes the sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced, just as salt has been over the past few years. 

'Salt content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by 20-40 per cent and as a result, salt intake has fallen in the UK by 15 per cent (between 2001-2011), the lowest known figure of any developed country.' 

'Like salt, most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks.

'There are also specific taste receptors for sugar, which if sugar intake is gradually reduced, become more sensitive. So over time we don’t notice that sugar levels have gone down.'
