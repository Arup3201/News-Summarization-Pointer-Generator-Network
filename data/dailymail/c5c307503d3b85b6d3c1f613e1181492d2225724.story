Germany forward Lukas Podolski insisted retiring from international duty has never crossed his mind after helping the world champions kick off their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a win over Scotland.

Unlike Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, who all called it a day after Joachim Low's side lifted the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, 29-year-old Podolski has not pondered hanging up his international boots.

'I'm still as hungry as ever,' said the Arsenal player, who came on as a late substitute as Germany toppled the Scots 2-1 in Dortmund on Sunday night.

He added in Kicker magazine: 'My next big goal is the European Championship.

'I still enjoy playing for Germany and it's a pleasure to be part of it all.'

Podolski no longer seems to be a regular in the Germany side, but that will not stop him from trying to win back Low's affection.

'I don't need to be afraid of anybody in the national team,' he added. 'And I'm not here just because I'm the joker Podolski who raises everybody's spirits.

'I'm here because I deserve to be here. I'm part of this team and I will get my games.'
