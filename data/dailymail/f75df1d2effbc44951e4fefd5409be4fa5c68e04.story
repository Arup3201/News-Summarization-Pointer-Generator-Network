'An estimated 800 people came to the park searching for money,' the user wrote. 'This is what the park looked like the next morning.'

The scavenger hunt was part of the Twitter account @HiddenCash. Its creator Jason Buzi, who became wealthy through real estate, leaves money in public areas and posts clues and photos as to the money's location online.

The Twitter account for @HiddenCash currently has 719,000 followers.

Shainajoy wrote online that 'There were traffic jams everywhere, people would literally park and leave their cars in front of peoples' driveways. People were running to the park like it was the end of the world or something. Huge families too.

'People were climbing all over the fountains, hopping over fences, tearing out plants, it was awful seeing a place I love just completely overtaken by people that dont even live in my city,' she also said.

Shainajoy said there were multiple Pez dispensers hidden in the park, which contained various dollar amounts.

Hint: Before the Thursday night event in Whittier @HiddenCash posted this hint online that money would be hidden in Pez dispensers

Creator: Jason Buzi, pictured, launched @HiddenCash as a way to give back

Hidden Cash had earlier tweeted a photograph of Pez dispensers, one of which had its top lifted and showed money inside.

The scavenger hunt caused $5,000 worth of damage and $1,700 for Whittier police to work overtime, The Whitter Daily News reported.

Assistant City Manager Nancy Mendez told the paper 'He seems like his heart’s in the right place, so we’ll ask [about reimbursement],' said Mendez. 'It was a nice idea, but 1,000 people is way too many for that poor old park.'

It's not clear if Buzi will continue to make more so-called night-drops.

'So no more night drops?' he tweeted. 'Totally different energy. This morning was awesome. Tonight, not so much.'
