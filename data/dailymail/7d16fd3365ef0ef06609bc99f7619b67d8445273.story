Some at Manchester United believe that, in Luke Shaw, they have signed the player who will go on to be the best left back in the world.

Certainly, Old Trafford chief executive Ed Woodward had told people how pleased he is with the arrival of the teenage defender.

Some of have questioned the transfer fee. It was £31m. That, though, will be rendered largely irrelevant if Shaw goes on to play for the club for a decade. Remember that some people thought £30m was too much money for Rio Ferdinand back in 2002.

The teenager has been called up to England's Under 21 squad for their crucial play-off

As he prepares to play for England Under 21s this week, what is abundantly clear is that Shaw has some improving to do. 

His club manager Louis van Gaal has recognised that and much of the the player's work on a daily basis at United's Carrington training ground is understood to focus on the basic nuts and bolts of his defending.

Modern full backs play a different game than those that came before them. Many of them are encouraged to be attacking players first and defenders second. In Shaw, it is easy to detect a bit of that.

For Van Gaal and the way he likes his teams to play, that does not necessarily represent a fundamental problem. For example, as he was extolling the virtues of a three-man defensive system to his players shortly after his arrival, he told his wing backs that he saw them as 'mainly attackers'.

Shaw, however, does look significantly better in one half of the field than the other and that, over time, perhaps needs to be addressed.

Against Everton for United at Old Trafford, for example, the 19-year-old was exceptional at times in the other half of the field. His understanding with Angel di Maria appears to have developed immediately and the two of them gave Tony Hibbert right back a terrible time for much of the afternoon.

It was the Everton right back, though, whom Shaw brought down to concede a penalty. Shaw thought he was hard done by. He wasn't. It was a reckless, impetuous tackle and that wasn't the only example of the young player getting it wrong that day.

Van Gaal, it must be said, didn't know that much about Shaw on arriving at United. His early concerns about his charge's fitness – the defender was carrying extra pounds during pre-season in America – were made clear but what did impress the new United manager is the manner in which the player responded.

'It's something I have got to work on,' admitted Shaw subsequently.

'It was a surprise when I got to United.

'I didn't come into United thinking it would be much harder. That's something that I think I made a mistake on.'

Shaw's efforts at Carrington have, by all accounts, been impressive since United's return from tour. Van Gaal noticed them immediately and was happy to enough to take England coach Roy Hodgson to task when he suggested Shaw had issues with general fitness going back to his Southampton days.

'He [Hodgson] has not been here to see him train,' said Van Gaal.

'He has been an example to the others. I'm really happy.'

Having just recovered from a hamstring injury, Shaw limped off with a bang to the knee on Sunday. It is not serious and he should start for Gareth Southgate's Under 21 team against Croatia this week. It may feel like a demotion, but it shouldn't.

At this stage of his career, he is better playing competitive football than sitting on the bench watching Leighton Baines.
