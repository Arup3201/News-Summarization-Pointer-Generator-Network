In the eyes of Richard Gough, change cannot come quickly enough at Rangers. He feels the club he once served with distinction has reached an historic low both on and off the field.

Suffering through television coverage of last Sunday’s 2-0 League Cup semi-final defeat to Celtic — in which the Ibrox side failed to register a single shot on target — was a further reminder of just how far standards have fallen.

The man who captained Rangers to nine-in-a-row is a supporter of Dave King and his move to oust the current board at an Extraordinary General Meeting. And Gough believes the kind of investment in the playing squad being proposed by King and his allies is desperately needed.

‘I’ve watched Rangers since the late 1970s. I know about the teams before then from my father and grandfather,’ said Gough. ‘This team is probably the worst Rangers team that’s ever played for the club.

‘It’s not their fault, it’s just the circumstances at the club. It could also be the worst Celtic team I’ve ever seen, to be fair. That’s the standard right now.

‘I remember speaking with David Murray, when he took over the club in 1988. We were out one night and he mentioned something about “his” club. I told him it was never his club — it’s the supporters’ club.

‘I didn’t go to Hampden on Sunday. I didn’t want to. But what struck me from watching on TV was the Rangers support. They were unbelievable, because they were watching a poor team being completely outplayed by Celtic.

‘But the Rangers fans remained very vocal in their support. That saddened me in a way because I knew if that had been a team I’d played in, which had been 2-0 down and getting played off the park by Celtic, we would have got hammered.

‘But the supporters know that the current team just doesn’t have the necessary quality. So I just hope Dave King can get control at the EGM, because it will be better for those fans again.

‘Loads of supporters have been asking me when is he going to get control. He has been trying to do something for the last few years but has just been blocked all the time.

‘Everyone has — it happened to Robert Sarver, too. The worry now is that the current team might not even get into the Premiership next season. I watch every game and it looks as if Hearts will win the Championship. It’s not a given that Rangers would get through a play-off against Hibs.

Rangers fans have not relented in their support despite the continuing problems

Gough has described Rangers current crop as 'the worst team to ever play for the club'

‘So we have to take it one step at a time. Let’s make sure Dave and the others get onto the board, get control of the club and then go from there.’

King has expressed supreme confidence about triumphing at the EGM, believing he already has more than 50 per cent of shareholders on his side. Should he be proved wrong, then Gough (right) would despair.

‘We are bang in trouble if Dave doesn’t win the day,’ said the 52-year-old. ‘I would fear for the club. In a lot of ways, it is the last chance to save it.

‘When Dave asked me to back him a while back, I thought it was the right thing to do. It’s pretty evident, with what has happened since then, that it is the right thing.

‘The club is in as bad a state as I’ve ever seen it. I’m not sure the supporters actually know how bad it is. I hear rumours all the time that there is now just one guy looking after the maintenance at Ibrox. It’s unrecognisable from what it was 10 years ago.’

Asked if he saw a role for himself under any King regime, Gough replied: ‘If Dave wanted me to do something, I would do it.’

A £10million loan from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is currently sustaining Rangers, who this week also received five players on loan from the St James’ Park reserves until the end of the season.

Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall claim he must play all five Newcastle players being loaned to the club

Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall claims he has been told to play them and Gough questions whether their arrival will upset things further with a squad toiling for progress.

‘I put myself back into when I was playing, when I was captain,’ he added. ‘How would I feel if I were Lee McCulloch and you suddenly get a job lot of guys coming into your dressing room?

‘OK, if you are bringing in Laudrups and Gascoignes to help you, fine. I hope they come in and do well for the club’s sake, but I also hear the rumours some of them are injured at the moment.

‘Kenny McDowall obviously doesn’t want to be there, he has handed in his notice as Alistair (McCoist) did.

‘So Kenny is there against his will, although he’ll keep working under the terms of his contract.

‘But the five players coming in are nothing to do with him. It’s such a strange situation but I don’t think anything which happens at the club will surprise anyone any more.’
