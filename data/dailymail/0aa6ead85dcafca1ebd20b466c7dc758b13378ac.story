It's been trying times for Australian Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe.

The 31-year-old has been in deep waters since he was admitted to rehabilitation in January and has been undergoing treatment for his longtime battle with depression.

But Thorpie is out from rehab and he's wasting no time getting back into the game.

Australian Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe is out of rehab and is expected to head over to the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in July. He is pictured in May after being released from hospital and being treated for a superbug infection following shoulder surgery

The Olympian is expected to attend the Commonwealth Games in Scotland next month after signing a deal with Channel Ten, reported The Sunday Telegraph.

Thorpe's manager is in negotiations with Channel Ten and European networks as he's taken up commentating roles at the swimming.

Ten will be announcing the news within the next fortnight and it is believed that Thorpe will work alongside fellow swim star Nicole Livingstone on the network's coverage of the games.

'That's great news that Ian is better,' Livingstone said.

'That's what we've all been hoping for.'

The five-time gold medalist spent three weeks in an intensive care ward in May after being treated for an infection he caught while undergoing shoulder surgery.

Will Erskine, from his management company, said Thorpe is 'in a great head space and doing really well again'.

'He's getting back into work and getting out and about and in the next couple of months he'll be travelling overseas. It's business as usual. There are a number of opportunities we are looking at case by case,' he said.

The swimming great recently attended his grandfather's funeral in Padstow where he had his arm in a sling from his shoulder operation.

Erskine said Thorpe will require further surgery on his shoulder.

'They had to take the pins and plates out from the original operation to get rid of an infection,' he said.

'At some stage there will be another operation to put them back in.'

Thorpe has been regaining his fitness with the help of his friend and trainer Christian Miranda, who did not want to comment about the swimmer's progress.

The former athlete will ease his way back into the social scene but will be avoiding parties and alcohol.

'Ian's in a great head space and doing really well again,' Will Erskine, from Thorpe's management company, said
