The Battle of Bosworth Field may never have happened if Henry Tudor's first attempt to seize the throne from Richard III two years earlier had not been thwarted by the weather, an academic claimed today.

The remains of the last Plantagenet king were dug up in a council car park in Leicester last year and following a lengthy investigation were positively identified earlier this month.

But Ros Smith, a PhD student at the University of Bristol's School of Geographical Sciences, believes Richard III may not have met his end at Bosworth Field, if it had not been for the storms of October 1483.

Battle of Bosworth, 22 August 1485: Experts now believe storms halted a previous attack after the River Severn was flooded

Born
in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 
until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field.

According
to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the 
battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into
battle, your head shall be broken on the return'.

On
the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow 
Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the 
battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was 
broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle

He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.

Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a 
hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an 
image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by 
Shakespeare.

Ms Smith was aware of a great storm and flood in the Severn Estuary in 1483 but she did not realise its historical significance until she read Shakespeare's Richard III.

Shakespeare's play, and the chronicles that he used to research historical events, document a co-ordinated attempt to confront Richard III in 1483.

Two armies set out, one led by the Duke of Buckingham and one by the Earl of Richmond - later to become Henry VII - but both failed to meet with Richard.

Shakespeare described how the Duke of Buckingham had amassed an army of Welshmen and aimed to cross the River Severn to confront Richard III at Salisbury but, due to flooding of the river, this became impossible: 'by sudden floods and fall of waters, Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd'.

Ms Smith also noted that the chronicles report that the Earl of Richmond had set sail from Brittany at the same time, with a 5,000 strong army, in an attempt to fight Richard for the crown, but, due to a great storm off the south west coast of England: 'The Bretagne navy [was] dispers'd by tempest'.

Nobody had ever made the historical connection between the two events before.

Ms Smith said: 'The combination of storm and flooding in the Severn Estuary was a significant event and led to the drowning of more than 200 people.

'Yet it would hardly have been mentioned in the chronicles if it hadn't disrupted the plans of Dukes and Earls.'

The world's only facial reconstruction of Richard III was recently unveiled after 528 years after his remains were found in a car park in Leicester. Here, he is face to face with his 17th generation nephew , Michael Ibsen

The Duke of Buckingham lost his head, but in 1485 the Earl of Richmond landed safely in Pembrokeshire and, with his strengthened army defeated Richard III at Bosworth Field, to become Henry VII.

Richard was the last English monarch to fall in battle and his death brought to a close the Wars of the Roses.

The Battle of Bosworth Field was 
fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War 
Of TheÂ  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and 
Lancaster.

One of the 
most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard 
III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best 
known quotations.

The 
leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, 
and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks.

The battle marked the final 
confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger 
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483.

Support
for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger 
brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. 
Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel.

Following
an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, 
Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485.

Gathering
support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and 
intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.

After
Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII
and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted
until 1603.
