A judge has ruled in favor of two interns who worked for an Oscar-winning film and filed suit against the film’s production company claiming it violated labor laws by not paying them.

Judge William H. Pauley III of Manhattan Federal District Court ruled Tuesday that Alex Footman and Eric Glatt should have been paid like regular employees because they did the same work as regular employees.

According to the judge, the internship on the set of Black Swan was not educational and merely served the benefit of Fox Searchlight Pictures by offering them free labor.

Victory: A Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled in favor of Alexander Footman, pictured, and Eric Glatt, who sued a production company for violating minimum wage laws with unpaid internships

The NY Times reports that about half of the one million internships worked by college undergraduates each year are unpaid, so the impact of this ruling could be broad and profound.

‘I’m absolutely thrilled,’ said Mr. Glatt told the Times. ‘I hope that this sends a very loud and clear message to employers and to students doing these internships, and to the colleges that are cooperating in creating this large pool of free labor — for most for-profit employers, this is illegal. It shouldn’t be up to the least powerful person in the arrangement to have to bring a lawsuit to stop this.’

While admitting that the two men benefited from their immersion in the entertainment industry and from potential future from an improved resume and job references, he called them ‘incidental to working in the office like any other employees and were not the result of internships intentionally structured to benefit them.’

Unfair: Eric Glatt is in his forties and has an MBA but wanted a foothold in the entertainment industry. He later came to see the way many get into the industry, through unpaid internships, as unfair and chose to sue

Footman worked full five-day weeks of up to 40 hours as a production intern on the film from October 2009 to February 2010.

He was tasked with making coffee for the production team, keeping the coffee pot full, taking and distributing lunch orders, taking out the trash, cleaning the office and collecting receipts for expenses, according to the lawsuit.

‘Searchlight received the benefits of their unpaid work, which otherwise would have required paid employees,’ said the judge.

Unfair? Black Swan (2011) grossed more than $300 million worldwide. The alleged Fox Searchlight pictures used unpaid interns to keep costs down and profits high, with no benefit to the the intern

A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox told the Times, ‘We are very disappointed with the court’s rulings. We believe they are erroneous, and will seek to have them reversed.’

Black Swan cost $13 million to produce and grossed more than $300 million worldwide. The lawsuit claimed Fox Searchlight has been able to reduce its production costs 'by employing a steady stream of unpaid interns.'

A lawyer for the two men said this is something they’d hoped, and believe will be, changed in the wake of the ruling.

Ruling: Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that Fox Searchlight should have paid two interns on the movie because they were essentially regular employees

The lawsuit was the first of several at the time that saw unpaid interns who believed they’d been wronged by their employers fighting back.

In one such suit in February of 2012, a former Hearst Magazines intern claimed she’d regularly worked in excess of 50 hours per week unpaid.

Now, things could be looking up for the country’s interns.

‘Employers have already started to take a hard look at their internship programs,’ Attorney Rachel Bien said. ‘I think this decision will go far to discourage private companies from having unpaid internship programs.’

The ruling indicates that a class action suit involving other Fox interns may now move forward.
