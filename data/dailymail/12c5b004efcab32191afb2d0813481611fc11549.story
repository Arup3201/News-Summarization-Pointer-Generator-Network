Islamic State has accepted a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian terrorists Boko Haram who killed 10,000 people in the country last year.

The audio message entitled 'kill and be killed' and released through the militants' vast social media channels was allegedly read by an ISIS spokesperson.

As well as welcoming Boko Haram's loyalty, the speech also threatens further violence against Christian and Jewish communities according to News Week.

Command: ISIS currently has territory in Iraq, Syria and a vast support structure across the Middle East and northern Africa - and its alliance with Boko Haram gives them access to north-east Africa too

Threat: As well as accepting Boko Haram's request, the recording also promises more violence against Christian and Jewish communities

Speaking for his leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the man in the recording says: 'We announce to you to the good news of the expansion of the caliphate to West Africa.

'Our caliph  has accepted the pledge of loyalty of our brothers of Boko Haram so we congratulate Muslims and our jihadi brothers in West Africa.'

He urged Muslims who could not join the fight in Syria to enter the conflict in Africa instead.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan claims Boko Haram insurgents have already traveled to the Middle East to train with ISIS militants, according toVoice of America.

In an interview with VOA he said: 'So we know the links are there. But even now, we may not know the degree of linkages as to how much funds are coming in from them, the kind of volume of weapons coming in from them, the nationalities coming from them.

'But the training, because some of the Boko Haram members go to have their training in the ISIS camp and come back.'

He refused to name the countries where the fighters were trained but said he has long suspected Boko Haram of already having links with other extremist groups globally. 

Brutality: Just last week, Boko Haram burned down a school (pictured) in the north-eastern village of Chibok from where they kidnapped 276 teenage girls in 2014

Massacre: The tens of thousands of Nigerians that have been killed in Boko Haram attacks included the 28 people who died in this Christmas Day bombing at two churches in 2011 

Partnership: After Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS, Nigeria's president revealed he has had suspicions that the militants have already traveled to the Middle East to train with Islamic State fighters 

Request: Boko Haram pledged its allegiance to ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend in their own audio message (pictured) 

His country has brought in hundreds of mercenaries from South Africa to aid Nigeria in its fight against Boko Haram, according to regional and military sources.

The foreign 'soldiers of fortune' were allegedly pictured on Twitter riding armoured vehicles through Maiduguri - the regional capital of Nigeria's north-east which has been besieged by terrorism.

A Reuters reporter with knowledge of the city was able to verify the location of the photo as  Bama road, leading south-east out of the city.

On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said two companies were providing 'trainers and technicians' to help Nigerian forces.  

The Nigerian terrorists first offered their allegiance to ISIS - who command territory in Syria and Iraq - over the weekend in their own audio message.

It said: 'We announce our allegiance to the Caliph... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease.'

The insurgents have killed thousands in bomb attacks and violent sieges on villages in the remote north-east, and are now feared to be spilling over into neighbouring Cameroon and Chad.

Reinforcements: The UN has called on the international community to supply Nigeria with arms and support but there have already been reports of hundreds of South African mercenaries in the country (pictured)

Armed support: These pictures emerged on Twitter and appear to show 'soldiers of fortune' - in the north-east's capital of Maiduguri - who have been recruited to take on Boko Haram in Nigeria

Members of the UN Security Council have called on the international community to supply money, equipment, troops and intelligence to the five-nation African coalition fighting them.

A draft resolution between the countries authorises the use of force against Boko Haram and Chad believes it will be approved as early as next week.

Boko Haram killed an estimated 10,000 people last year and took responsibility for last April's abduction of more than 275 schoolgirls.

The resolution demands the immediate release of anyone abducted by Boko Haram which it calls 'one of the most serious threats to international peace and security'. 

The United States, Britain, France and the European Union are backing the formation of a multinational force of 8,750 troops led by Nigeria and Chad with contingents from Cameroon, Niger and Benin. 

The militants have been waging a six-year insurgency to impose strict Shariah law in Nigeria and earlier this year it launched attacks across the border on Cameroon - before striking Niger and Chad.
