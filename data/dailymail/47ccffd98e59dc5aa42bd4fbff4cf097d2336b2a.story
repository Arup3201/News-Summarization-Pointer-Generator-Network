Louis van Gaal has confirmed that Wayne Rooney has recovered from a knee injury and will lead Manchester United at Southampton on Monday night.

Sportsmail revealed that Rooney, who was hurt when he collided with advertising hoardings against Hull last weekend, has been cleared to play after missing Tuesday’s win over Stoke as a precaution.

Asked about the striker’s fitness at his weekly press conference, Van Gaal said: ‘The news is very good, he shall play.’

However, United’s record signing Angel di Maria will miss the trip to St Mary’s after coming off against Hull with a suffering a slight tear of his hamstring.

‘It (his return) shall be quickly but not for Monday.’

United face two difficult games against third-placed Southampton and old rivals Liverpool. Van Gaal added: ‘Southampton play better at this moment and have more points than Liverpool so the sequence is good that we have to play Southampton now. What more can I say?

‘I am always occupied with the first match and that’s Southampton. After the match we can say that but before it is always difficult.’

The return of Rooney will be a big boost to Van Gaal who also has Radamel Falcao in contention for a starting spot up front.

The Colombian replaced 19-year-old James Wilson after 78 minutes against Mark Hughes' side as he bids to return to full fitness following a troublesome calf injury.

One player who appears certain to start for United is Chris Smalling, who has been an ever-present in defence since returning from a one-game suspension picked up against rivals Manchester City.

Speaking to manutd.com, Smalling said: 'I am feeling good and it is nice to get a little bit of a run.

'Through quite a lot of my time [at United], I have had a good run and then it has stopped for whatever reason. Hopefully I can kick on and just get a good run and cement my place.'

Smalling was sent-off against City but he believes he is now beginning to assert himself in Van Gaal's first-choice XI.

'That [the red card against City] was obviously disappointing,' he added.

'I felt I did quite well in the Chelsea game and then I had the City slip-up. But there was a chance for me to take and I feel like I am really taking that. Hopefully it will continue.'

United can leapfrog Southampton into third place in the Premier League table with a victory  on the south coast.

Van Gaal's side have won their last four Premier League games to climb into the top four and occupy a Champions League qualification spot.

And United will be looking for a fifth straight victory at Southampton before their massive clash with rivals Liverpool next Sunday at Old Trafford.
