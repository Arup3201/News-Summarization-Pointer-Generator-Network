When Burger King decided to give its U.S. menu a 
revamp, the fast food chain unveiled a new lower-calorie selection, designed to 
lure in health conscious customers.

The new menu is being promoted in their biggest marketing campaign to date, but although English football star David Beckham features in a glossy advert - the menu will not be offered to British customers.

The fast food chain has decided that only
 the U.S, will enjoy their upgraded menu and Britain and the rest of the world, have been left 
sidelined.

One rule for them: The new Burger King menu has been promoted in the company's  biggest marketing campaign to date, but the menu will only be offered to American outlets, left, not British customers, right

A Burger King spokesperson said the new menu 'was a U.S. focused campaign.'

'There
 are currently no plans to introduce the referenced products launched in
 the U.S. in the UK, as they have been developed based on US customer 
research,' he explained.

Burger King started in Miami in 1954, and has since expanded to 72 countries worldwide.

Star promotion: Although English football star David Beckham features in a glossy advert , but that is where the British elements of the new menu end

Very clever marketing: Beckham was selected to spearhead a new Burger King commercial specifically advertising the fast food chain's new healthy smoothie

The fast-food chain defended its 
decision saying that 'in the UK, Burger King and it’s franchisees offer a
 number of healthy options on its menu, 'including the sweet chili 
chicken wrap at 296 calories and our hamburger at 260 calories and 4g of
 fat.'

The decision to focus on the U.S. 
could be down to the need to focus on competition -  Burger King is no 
longer the nearest challenger to McDonald's among the U.S. burger chains.

It has fallen into third place behind Wendy's, according to researcher Technomic.

But outside of the U.S. Burger King has significantly more restaurants than Wendy's, so does not look like it will lose its 
position as the global No2.

The new U.S. choices mean Burger King's menu is now startlingly similar to their competitor McDonald's.

Over the past year, Burger King 
evaluated all of its ingredients from the bacon to the cheese slices it 
serves on its char-grilled burgers as part of a year long quest to 
reverse years of slumping sales of its Whoppers and fries. 

The
 result is a changed menu which features frappe coffees, chicken strips 
and snack wraps- all of which have been heavily promoted at McDonalds 
for years at this point.

The
 Golden Arches already rolled out speciality salads in 2003, snack wraps
 in 2006, premium coffee drinks in 2009, and fruit smoothies in 2010.

‘Being
 an innovator is critical in the fast-food industry,’ said Darren 
Tristano, an analyst for food industry researcher Technomic Inc.

But in recent years, he said Burger King has been more of a follower.

Burger
 King executives don't deny that its new items are pretty close to those
 on McDonald's popular menu. But they say the new menu was created as a 
result of Burger King's own research.

‘Consumers wanted more choices,’ said Steve Wiborg, president of Burger King's North America operations.

‘Not just healthy choices, but choices they could get at the competition.’

The 10 new items mark Burger King's biggest menu expansion since the chain opened its doors in 1954.

Concerns over obesity have paved the way for competitors like Subway, 
now the second-biggest chain, and Starbucks, which climbed up the 
rankings to the No. 3 spot.

After
 much resistance, the attitude from the bosses at Burger King 
changed after New York-based private equity firm 3G Capital bought 
Burger King last year.

Leader: McDonald's was the first of the fast food chains to expand their menu to include healthier options

That's
 when Burger King assembled a group of 15 key executives, franchisees 
and suppliers to evaluate the chain's menu, item by item.

To get the word out about the changes, Burger King is rolling out its biggest marketing campaign ever.

The televison
 ads will feature celebrities, including soccer player David Beckham, 
comedian Jay Leno and actress Salma Hayek.

And in one spot, R&B singer 
Mary J. Blige croons the ingredients of the snack wraps.
