Banners flew over stadiums today demanding that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell step down and fans have begun circulating a shocking Photoshopped picture of a model with a black eye that reads 'Get your game face on.'

The separate campaigns are stepping up criticism of the most popular sport in America - and on the man who who led it to dominance - after video of NFL star Ray Rice brutally punching his fiance emerged this week.

The NFL's public image further took hits this week after former MVP running back Adrian Peterson was arrested for severely whipping his young son with a stick and Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy was kicked off the Carolina Panthers roster two months after he was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend.

The controversy caused veteran ESPN anchor Hannah Storm to blast the NFL in rare emotional comments at the end of Sports Center today.

Fans are beginning to call for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation after he was accused of lying about the league's knowledge of the Ray Rice video

She said the league's handling of the Rice incident led her to question whether female fans have a place in the league. 

'What does the NFL stand for?' she asked.   

Ultra Violent and the National Organization for Women, two advocacy groups, are flying banners reading 'Goodell Must Go' above NFL stadiums today before games in New York, San Francisco and Cleveland, Ohio. The banner will also fly over the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, before Monday Night Football. 

The signed will appear  over the stadiums for two hours prior to the games - before federally-enforced no-fly rules take effect.

Goodell's decision to suspend Rice for two games caused outrage. The national furor  increased last week when new video emerged of Rice punching his fiance and knocking her unconscious in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, hotel elevator in March. Reports emerged that the NFL had seen the video months ago - despite Goodell publicly claiming otherwise. 

After the second video came out, Rice was booted from the Ravens and suspended from the NFL indefinitely.  

'The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has been caught in a despicable and disgusting lie and he must resign,' Ultra Violet says.

The group has started a petition demanding he step down. 

The fury over Goodell and the NFL's treatment of players arrested for domestic violence has led thousands of Twitter users to begin circulating a shocking Photoshopped picture of a model with a black eye and Baltimore Ravens makeup. The image reads, 'Get your game face on!' 

The controversial image, which uses an ad for CoverGirl's NFL makeup line, has been shared dozens of times across social media.

The NFL season's second football Sunday comes after one of the league's worst weeks in recent memory.

In addition to the rising criticism over the handling of the Rice case, former MVP Adrian Peterson was arrested in Texas for whipping his young son with a stick and leaving wounds all over the boy's body, including on his genitals. 

Peterson's lawyer has said the star didn't meant to hurt the boy and was merely using the same kind of discipline he had as a child.   

The Minnesota Vikings kicked Peterson off their roster and he steered clear of the stadium today - even though he was allowed to watch from the sidelines. 

That didn't stop Vikings fans from wearing Peterson's jersey by the thousands. Peterson is the biggest star on the team. One tailgating fan even wore a Peterson jersey and carried a switch - like the NFL star allegedly used to whip his son. 

On Sunday, the Carolina Panthers deactivated one of their biggest stars, Greg Hardy, two months after his conviction by a North Carolina judge for allegedly battering his girlfriend in May.

The team had been under mounting pressure to take Hardy off the field following the release of the Rice video this week.
