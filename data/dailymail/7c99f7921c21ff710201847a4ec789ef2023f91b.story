This is the moment a masked raider was caught on camera pointing a long-barrelled gun at the front door of a bookmakers.

Eyewitnesses said the gunman knocked on the door and shouted as he aimed the weapon through the glass entrance of Coral,  in Rugby, Warwickshire, at 7.30pm on February 12.

CCTV pictures taken from outside show the man holding the gun wearing a three-quarter length green and khaki camouflage jacket. His face is concealed by a Scorpion motorcycle helmet.

A second person is also seen standing next to him dressed in a dark Nike top with the hood pulled up over his head to hide his face.

The intruders ran off empty handed from the shop in Hillmoreton Road, after staff bravely locked the door as they saw the men approach the bookies.

But yesterday, police revealed as well as the attempted robbery they are hunting the duo in connection with two other robberies at bookies in Rugby and Leicestershire.

Officers believe just an hour after being caught on camera, the pair stole money from behind the counter in another Coral bookmakers 14 miles away in Burbage, Leics., at 8.30pm on February 12.

Police also say the thugs made off with money after threatening a cashier at Corals in Bilton, Rugby, a day earlier on February 11.

Detective Inspector Roy Wheelwright, from Warwickshire Police, said: 'We are working with police colleagues in Leicestershire because we believe the same people are involved in all three incidents [Hillmorton Road, Bilton and Leicestershire].

Eyewitnesses said the thug banged on the door and shouted as he aimed the weapon through the glass entrance of Coral at 7.30pm on February 12

'The camouflage jacket and motorcycle helmet seen in the CCTV images are particularly distinct, especially when worn together and we would like to hear from anyone who knows of anyone with clothing matching these two items.'

Police also revealed a further three more incidents were reported at two Coral shops and a Ladbrokes shop in the space of 24 hours last Monday and Tuesday.

Detective Inspector Roy Wheelwright added: 'Although we cannot rule out that there is a link between these incidents and those from last week, they have different characteristics and we remain open minded.

'We welcome any information from witnesses who may have seen these latest incidents at Coral bookmakers on The Green in Bilton, Coral bookmakers in Bridget Street and Ladbrokes in Clifton Road.'

Officers say that all bookies across the town are operating 'enhanced security measures' following the robbery, attempted robbery and suspicious incidents. 

Witnesses or anyone with information can call Rugby CID on 101.
