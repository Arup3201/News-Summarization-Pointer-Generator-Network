When you step on board a flight, you never know what you're going to get.

The screaming child who kicks the back of your seat for three hours, the passenger that invades your personal space or the incessant snorer.

Everyone has their own personal airline gripes, besides the things you can guarantee - warmed up food and minuscule leg room.

Now the passengers who make your flight hell have been named and shamed in a survey of more than 1550 air travellers, with seat recliners being hailed as the most despised.

Flight heaven or hell? 35 per cent of people in a survey despised people who recline their seats

Almost 35 per cent of people put the passenger who reclines their seat as their number one nightmare.

The news comes as debate rages over reclining etiquette after a fight between two passengers broke out on a United Airlines jet on August 24. 

The plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago after a woman on the flight threw soda at a man seated behind her who used the $21.95 ($A23.57) device to stop her reclining her seat on the four-hour flight from Newark to Denver.

Parents who allow their children to be disruptive on a flight are the third most disliked passengers

Australia's largest airline companies, Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar, have all banned the Knee Defender gadget that stops passengers from reclining their seats

A fight broke out between two passengers  on a United Airlines jet on August 24 over reclining seats 

The fight started when the male passenger, James Beach, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the Knee Defender to stop the woman in front of him from reclining while he was working on his laptop, according to a law enforcement official.

Since the incident there has been a surge in global sales for the Knee Defender, with many more passengers seemingly fed up with people reclining their seats.

However, Australia's largest airline companies, Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar, have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the Knee Defender gadget is banned on their flights. 

In a survey of 1550 air travellers, the seat reclining passenger was hailed as the worst. These cartoons have been published with the permission from AirlineRatings.com

The smelly passenger was named as the number two hate of air travellers

Major U.S. airlines including United Airlines also prohibit use of the device.

The annual AirlineRatings.com survey named the smelly passenger as the number two hate of air travellers with 25.5 per cent commenting on their fellow flyers' bad hygiene.

The travel website's editor, Geoffrey Thomas, said: 'There has been a significant shift in passengers’ gripes about their fellow travellers, who are either not conscious of their odour or don’t care.

'With online or cell phone check-in now widespread, offending passengers are slipping through the traditional checks and only coming into contact with airline agents at the boarding gate. The agents, under pressure to get the flight away, sometimes let offenders slip through.'

The third most hated passenger was the parent who let their child run riot. They came in third with 20.1 per cent, while the fourth award went to space invaders and fifth prize went to the non-stop talker. 

Loud children who are allowed to run riot by parents are also disliked

People who took up lots of space came in as the fourth most hated air travellers

Frequent flyers also dislike people who talk too much on planes
