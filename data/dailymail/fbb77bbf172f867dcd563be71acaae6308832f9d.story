Yaya Toure has added fuel to the speculation that he may be on his way out of Manchester City this summer by declaring it would be 'an honour' to play for Paris Saint-Germain.

The midfielder has been at odds with his current club since his agent spoke out over a perceived lack of respect for the midfielder from the club owner's on his 31st birthday two weeks ago.

And when asked about whether he would ever consider switching to the current French champions, Toure was far from ambiguous in his response.

Speculation: Yaya Toure has fuelled rumours he will leave Man City by saying PSG move would be 'an honour'

Fans favourite: Toure scored 24 goals in 49 games for Man City last season

'When I 
think about objectives of Paris Saint-Germain, how can you not be 
interested in a club like that?' he told France Football.

'PSG have become a European power. It'd be an honour to be part of such a club one day... if I can be of use.'

The former Barcelona player was one of the stars of last season, scoring 24 goals in 49 games, and Manchester City fans will be concerned that he has once again intimated at a potential switch away.

In the buildup to the Champions League final on Saturday, Toure was asked by Richard Keys on beIN sports whether City fans could expect to see him in their sky blue colours next season, Toure replied: 'That’s a good question. I think, to be honest with you now, there’s been a couple of rumours, a couple of things going out, but as a player you always want to focus and keep calm.

'As well as that, the fact that the fans look up to you and the people love you, they always want to question you and they always want an answer from you, but for my part I have come to Qatar to try and recover from an injury and to prepare myself for the World Cup.

'After the World Cup I will make a statement but there is a lot of things in the media and as a player that’s sometimes difficult and I have to manage that. The World Cup is very important for my country and I need to focus on that.'

Toure is currently on international duty with Ivory Coast ahead of the World Cup, and any potential move is unlikely to take place until his involvement in Brazil has ended.

The midfielder has 82 caps for the national team, scoring 16 goals, and is hoping to have a big impact on the tournament after disappointing group stage exits for his country in the last two World Cups.

Ivory Coast begin their campaign against Japan on Sunday June 15, before rounding off their Group C campaign with games against Colombia and Greece.
