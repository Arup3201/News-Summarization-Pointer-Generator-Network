Bad timing: Samsung and Google have delayed the launch of the Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system and Nexus Prime smartphone following the death of Steve Jobs

In a statement released this week Samsung CEO Choi Gee-sung praised the accomplishments of the Apple founder.

He said: 'Steve Jobs introduced numerous revolutionary changes to the information technology industry and was a great entrepreneur.

'His innovative spirit and remarkable accomplishments will forever be remembered by people around the world.

'Under
 the current circumstances, both parties have agreed that this is not 
the appropriate time for the announcement of a new product.

'We would ask for the understanding of our clients and media for any inconvenience caused. We will announce a new date and venue in due course.'

Ice Cream Sandwich is believed to combine previous the smartphone and tablet operating systems Gingerbread and Honeycomb, into a single operating system.

It is rumoured to offer a raft of innovative new features including a lockscreen system using facial recognition, more multitasking and resizable widgets.

The firms, Apple and Samsung in particular, are bitter rivals in the smartphone and tablet PC sector.

While the iPhone remains the most popular single smartphone handset, sales of phones running the Android platform have outsold it by more than twice the amount globally.

However Apple remain strong market leaders in the tablet PC sector with the ipad accounting for 73 per cent of all sales and tablets running Android only accounting for about 17 per cent.

Apple and Samsung and are currently locked in legal battles over design patents all over the world.

And a Samsung spokesman said the death of Steve Jobs will have no effect on their ongoing disputes.

In a statementÂ  issued on Thursday a spokesman for Samsung said: 'Jobs' death and the legal disputes are two separate matters, and we plan to file injunctions blocking sales of Apple products in more countries as planned.'

Samsung is not the only IT firm in legal disputes with Apple. Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker and their partners Microsoft have both had the same experience.
