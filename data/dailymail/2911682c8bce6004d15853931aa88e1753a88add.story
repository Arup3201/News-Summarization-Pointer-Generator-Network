People who only consume organic products could be suffering from 'chemophobia' and missing out on nutrients found in modern foods

Do you only eat organic food and think microwave meals are 'toxic'?

If so, you could be suffering from chemophobia - an 'irrational' fear of chemicals - and missing out on nutrients found in modern food.

U.S. researchers have warned that instead of avoiding pesticides and dioxins, people should be more concerned about natural bacteria, fungi and pathogens.

They found millions of people are scared of eating unnatural substances, but low doses of natural and synthetic chemicals used in meals pose no risk to people's health.

The report, by Dartmouth College in the U.S. which is published in the journal Food Security, argues that low doses of chemicals in modern meals are 'typically harmless and highly beneficial.'

It also says that the word 'chemical' has unfairly negative connotations.

Study author and chemistry professor Gordon Gribble, said: 'Most people don't know they are routinely exposed to a host of compounds in non-toxic concentrations in what they eat and drink each day.

'Even the air they breathe – whether in big cities or the countryside -- is full of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals, including wine 'aroma,' flower 'bouquet,' perfume 'fragrance,' bakery 'smell' and the 'stench' of rubbish bins.'

However, he said the chemicals are not inhaled in a large enough quantities to affect humans' health.

Many of the same compounds found in 
pesticides are made naturally by plants, animals and humans 'for their 
own defensive purposes,' according to Professor Gribble.

Professor Gribble cited the example of halogen 
compounds, which many people - even many scientists - assume are all 
uniquely man-made poisons found in dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) and the pesticide DDT.

But he said thousands of halogen compounds
 are part of our natural environment made by plants,
 animals and even humans for their own defensive purposes.

Some species 
even use organohalogens, which contain carbon along with chlorine, 
bromine, iodine or fluorine, to mount chemical offensives against 
encroaching competitors.

While the report says that some beneficial chemicals are found in modern food, it does not suggest swapping fresh vegetables for microwave meals but instead eating a varied diet to avoid exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals

He said: 'Food regulators should focus not on pesticides, antibiotics and dioxins but on pathogens, bacteria and fungi, which each year cause millions of cases of food-borne infections in the United States that result in hospitalisation or death.'

Professor Gribble recommends that people eat  'a diverse diet to minimise their exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals.'

He said food is peppered with natural compounds such as organohalogens, dioxins, aflatoxins and many others.

'Food is chemistry beyond our immediate control, including those synthetic chemicals that are deemed to be artificial and should not be found in 'safe' food.

'The word 'chemical' became a dirty word despite the fact that everything we see, smell and touch is chemical.'
