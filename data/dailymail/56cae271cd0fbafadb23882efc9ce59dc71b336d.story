Under fire: Mayor Boris Johnson has been accused of 'public health fraud' over his use of dust suppresants

Boris Johnson has been accused of 'public health fraud' for ordering the use of dust suppressants to cut readings at pollution monitoring stations in London.

The London Mayor could be avoiding hundreds of millions in EU fines by ordering the use of sprays to cut the amount of dust in the air near pollution monitoring stations.

But the tactic could also be putting the public at risk by masking the true extent of pollution levels in the city and preventing smog warnings when pollution is severe.

Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air in London told MailOnline: 'This is deadly serious. We’re talking about dangerous particles, some of which are toxic or carcinogenic, not inert house dust.

'It’s public health fraud on an industrial scale to use pollution suppressants in front of the air quality monitors most relied on to warn the public of smog episodes and report legal breaches. 

'The Mayor needs to reduce pollution at source not hide it from monitors.'

The tactic was revealed in a report by the Mayor's office recocomending the use of the sticky salt spray along busy streets, particularly during the Olympic Games.

Saline solution sprayed by trucks usually used for salting roads in winter makes fine dust particles stick to the ground rather than hover in the air.

Pollution hot-spots like Upper Thames Street, Marylebone Road and Neasden Lane are among the 15 sites were the so-called 'dust suppressants' are alreay being used.

All of the sites are close to official air quality monitoring stations which measure the level of pollution in the city, Mr Birkett pointed out.

He said Upper Thames Street, in the 
City. was the first to record a breach in air quality levels, while 
Marylebone Road, in Westminster, is the location of the government's own
pollution monitoring station.

Pollution levels are measured in tiny particles of soot and dirt from traffic emissions. When inhaled, the particulate matter, known as PM10s, can cause heart and lung problems.

The daily limit of PM10 in the UK must not be higher than 50 micrograms per metre squared more than 35 times in a calendar year to meet European Commission targets.

Olympic route: The first sighting of the dust suppressor truck on the streets of London

Even with the use of dust 
suppressants, on Neasden Lane this level has already been exceeded 32 
times since the beginning of 2012, while in Upper Thames Street it has 
been exceeded 28 times, Clean Air in London claims.

On Marylebone Road the level has been breached 25 times, according to figures provided by the campaign group.

If
and when the EC quota is breached the UK could find itself facing the 
European Court of Justice, which enforces European law. The country 
faces a fine of £300million if it fails to clean up its act.

The
Department for the Environment issued its first summer smog alert the 
weekend before last after high ozone levels were recorded. This kind of 
pollution, the most dangerous for athletes, occurs when sunlight reacts 
with pollutants.

Mr Birkett said: 'Marylebone Road and Upper Thames Street are at the absolute heart of the Olympic road network.

'TFL's plan for dealing with pollution during the Olympics is to use the suppressor truck. Unbelievable.'

The Mayor's own pollution strategy recommends the use of the suppressants to achieve 'compliance' with European standards.

The document reads: 'There are other days where a location only just exceeds the EU limit value.

'In
these circumstances a reduction in local emissions or concentrations 
(for example, by preventing re-suspension) will help achieve 
compliance.'

Heart of the City: The daily limit of PM10 pollution on Upper Thames Street has been exceeded 28 times so far this year

Dirty: The limit has been breached in Neasden Lane 32 times

West End: And in Westminster's Marylebone Road the limit has been exceeded 25 times. Clean Air in London believes this picture shows residue from saline spray

Mr Johnson's office has said the suppressants are part of a short term strategy to cut pollution alongside long term measures to improve air quality like bringing in more low emission zones and planting more trees.

His office told the Daily Telegraph that having monitors at the busiest traffic spots made sense as it forces the UK to clean up its dirtiest air, and that these were also the most important areas to use dust suppressants.

But Mr Birkett claimed the suppressants were simply being used to avoid taking firm action on pollution.

'What this is about is that actually we need to be focusing on the solutions,' he said. 'This is mainly a diesel problem and we need to be focusing on diesel emissions.

'Our low emission zone is two years and two steps behind the one in Berlin and that's the real test of whether we are getting to grips with pollution levels.'
