Fraud probe: Lee Jones, former general manager of Champneys spa in Tring

To millions of TV viewers, Lee Jones was the smooth star of a documentary about luxury health spa Champneys. 

The manager of the resort in Hertfordshire, whose clients include Barbra Streisand, pandered to his guests’s every whim.

But last week, after a tip-off from a viewer, the venue in Tring found itself at the centre of a fraud investigation as around £10,000 from petty cash was discovered to be missing… and so was Mr Jones.

The slick 40-year-old, who drove a £60,000 Range Rover, began working at Champneys last September as deputy manager, then took over as general manager in April. 

Colleagues recalled the 6ft 3in charmer as ‘incredibly charismatic’. 

They were also intrigued by his background: he told them his mother held a stake in Louis Vuitton and that his QC father had thrown him out because he was gay.

Mr Jones said his mother gave him a £10,000-a-month allowance but he wanted to work to show his father he could ‘be something’. 

He claimed he lived in a £5 million house in Notting Hill – only later was it discovered that ‘Curly Crescent’ doesn’t exist.

After the screening of the ITV documentary this month, PR director Cheryl Howard recognised the man she claims tried to fleece her. 

When confronted by Champneys bosses last Monday, Mr Jones dismissed the claims as ‘fantasy’, then left for the day, saying he wanted to consult lawyers. He never returned.

According to Champneys sources, last week Mr Jones withdrew £6,100 from petty cash, telling colleagues it was authorised by the spa’s co-owner Stephen Purdew. 

An earlier withdrawal for £3,500 was explained as ‘garden furniture for Mr Purdew’. Mr Purdew denied any knowledge of either transaction. 

Ms Howard said she met Mr Jones two years ago when he was working at a London hotel, and she had no reason to think he was anything other than respectable.

Last summer, Mr Jones told her he was temporarily homeless and she offered to let him stay at her house in Weybridge, Surrey. A few weeks later she noticed unusual activity on her credit and store cards.

‘I was in Harrods and one of the managers asked me how it was that I was simultaneously in the store and trying to buy something on my online account,’ she said. 

‘Someone using the delivery address of my house in Weybridge was trying to order £2,080 worth of kitchen equipment, flowers, sports clothing and suits.’

She suspected Mr Jones and told him to leave, and then found three credit cards had been fraudulently applied for using her address. 

She called police, who referred her to Action Fraud, the national fraud agency. 

They have not contacted her since. When Mrs Howard saw the same man on TV she called Champneys.

Yesterday it was confirmed a case of alleged ‘employee-related fraud’ at Champneys was being investigated by Action Fraud. 

The Mail on Sunday yesterday tracked Mr Jones down to a £90,000 terraced house in Redditch, Worcestershire. 

His parents – Mary, 64, and David, 65 – live in a £120,000 ex-council house in Oldbury, West Midlands. 

Mr Jones Snr is not a QC, and his wife does not have shares in Louis Vuitton. 

‘Our Lee’s been on holiday, but he’s just got back. I’ll tell him you’re trying to contact him,’ said Mrs Jones.

Though someone was clearly in at Mr Jones’s house, no one answered the door. 

We put our allegations in writing through the letterbox, but received no response.
