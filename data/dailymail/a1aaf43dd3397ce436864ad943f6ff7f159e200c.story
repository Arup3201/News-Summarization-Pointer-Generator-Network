Mystery: Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler has not been to work for three months, but the council is refusing to reveal why

Anger was growing today over a council's refusal to reveal the whereabouts of its £160,000-a-year boss who has not been to work in her flood-stricken county for three months.

Pressure groups and politicians have called on Somerset Council Council to explain the absence of chief executive Sheila Wheeler after councillors revealed they had been threatened with legal action if they talk.

Mrs Wheeler was first said to be on sick leave but it has since emerged that a row with a senior staff member could be a factor.

She has been away from her desk since mid-November and has not played any part in the handling of the flooding crisis, the council's biggest ever peace-time emergency.

But the chief executive and the council has been cricised after it refused to offer any explanation for the absence of Mrs Wheeler, who earns more than the Prime Minister.

Councillors have also remained tight-lipped, saying they have been ordered not to reveal the reasons behind her absence.

Justine Baker, the Lib Dem councillor for Bishop's Hull ward, said: 'We know part of the reason, but not the full reason.

'But
 we've been told we're not allowed to tell anyone for legal reasons to 
the extent we could be individually liable for legal action. We don't 
know when to expect her back.

'Residents are angry that they're not being told anything and are accusing the council of a cover up.'

Andrew Govier, Labour councillor for Wellington ward, added: 'All councillors have been told it must remain confidential.'

It is understood the situation would be discussed tonight in a confidential session at the end of a full council meeting.

Questions have been raised as to the reasons behind her absence with a rumoured conflict with the Conservative leader of the council, John Osman, thought to be a factor.

A request was made under the Freedom of Information Act in November asking the council to reveal e-mails between the pair, but they shed little light on the alleged row.

It comes as a survey today suggested that flooding had cost businesses in Somerset more than £1.2million in just six weeks, according to the Chamber of Commerce.

Somerton and Frome MP David Heath asked Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mrs Wheeler's absence.

Mr Heath asked the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrew Lansley for a Commons debate on transparency and the use of public funds in local government.

He said members of the council have been gagged by a confidentiality clause in their contracts.

Mr Lansley said he would not comment on the specific case, but said the Government was taking steps to simplify the process used for resolving disputes with senior council staff.

The Taxpayers' Alliance said it was not fair to taxpayers or Mrs Wheeler for so many questions to remain about 'this sorry state of affairs.'

Somerset County Council originally said Mrs Wheeler was on sick leave and wished her a speedy recovery.

In January, it said she 'continues to be away from the office', adding: 'This council has a strict policy of not commenting on employees and this continues to be the case.'

This week the council said there was no change to its previous statements on the matter.

Councillors today said they had been sworn to secrecy Mrs Wheeler's absence.

Lib Dem Yeovil MP David Laws said: 'Given that public money is involved a clear and honest explanation from the council is needed.'

Mrs Wheeler, who is on a permanent contract, joined Somerset County Council in 2009 after previously working in local government for Adur District Council, Surrey County Council and the London Borough of Hounslow.

Her time at Surrey also included a secondment to central Government and she moved one of her authorities from a rating of 'weak' to 'excellent'.

Mrs Wheeler's remuneration for 2012-2013 is listed as £160,000 in salary with an employer pension contribution of £21,600.

Pat Flaherty, the deputy chief executive and director of operations, is acting chief executive in her absence.

Mrs Wheeler and Mr Osman have declined to comment.
