A newlywed couple are challenging themselves to live the first 90 days of marriage life using only Bitcoin - a cult digital currency.

For three months, Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham will attempt to pay rent, buy groceries, eat at restaurants and even go on a road trip using the currency, ditching their credit cards and cash. The experiment will begin when the Provo, Utah, pair return from their honeymoon on July 27.

'I'm always up for an adventure, and 
we're starting off our lives together (so) why not start out doing 
something different and unique?' Bingham, a graphic designer, said of 
the project called Life on Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, and the coins, worth $107 each on Tuesday afternoon, are kept in an online wallet. The currency, created in 2009, can buy you everything from soap to illegal drugs and bee-keeping equipment.

But Bingham and Craig are determined to find out if they can survive using Bitcoin in the real world.

'The idea is to push the outer limits of what's possible with bitcoins,' 29-year-old Craig told the Deseret News. 'A lot of what this documentary is going to be is us figuring it out and having a camera along with us.'

The couple are raising money - and bitcoins - for the documentary and have made a video for their Kickstarter page explaining their unique mission.

On the page and in the video they make a desperate appeal for small businesses and stores that accept bitcoins to make themselves known.

Bingham's employer has already agreed to pay her in the currency but paying rent will be one of their main hurdles.

'We are going to talk to our landlord,' Bingham told the newspaper. 'We are going to call him up and tell him what we're doing and see if he'll take Bitcoin.'

Food: Groceries and everyday expenses will also have to be paid for with the virtual currency

Other transactions will also take some serious negotiation, particularly when they leave the safety net of friends and family and hit the road, in a car they've, hopefully, managed to buy with bitcoins.

'It's going to be talking to people, explaining how Bitcoin works, why it's beneficial, and persuading them that we can do this and it will be very painless for you,' Craig said.

If things are going really well, the couple hope to use the currency to travel to another country - one where Bitcoin has support. But that will require them to find a travel agency or airline that will take them, and that may prove a feat too much.
