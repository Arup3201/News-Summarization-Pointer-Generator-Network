Appeal: Durham Police released a photo of Lee Wildman in a bid to track him down over the theft

A suspect wanted over a £2million heist had been held in custody – but was released on bail after confusion between police and prosecutors, it has emerged.

Lee Wildman, 35, was arrested and questioned by detectives investigating the theft of precious artefacts from a museum on Thursday, last week.

But he was bailed on Monday after the Crown Prosecution Service apparently decided there was not enough evidence to bring a charge.

Police were unable to find him the next day when they decided to re-arrest him for further questioning.

Detective and prosecutors are now trying to pointing the finger at each other over who made the decision to free Mr Wildman.

A Durham Police spokesman said that they were under pressure because  'we are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold 
people without charge', adding: 'at the time we were both working 
exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging, fast moving 
conditions.'

Detective Superintendent Adrian Green told the Mirror: ‘He has been arrested, he has been 
interviewed, he has been bailed and now we wish to interview him again.'

‘We will be making inquiries to tract 
him and re-arrest him. The evidence was felt by some not to be strong 
enough to charge,’ he said, adding that the decision whether to charge 
was no longer down to police.

However, the CPS said when it believed
enough evidence has been secured it gave the green light to bring 
charges. But at some stage Mr Wildman was released.

The CPS told the Mirror: ‘This was a 
fast moving matter with finely balanced decisions taken within strict 
legal custody time limits.’

Mr Wildman was one of five people 
from the West Midlands who were arrested and bailed pending further 
inquiries, following the night raid at Durham University's Oriental Museum.

The raiders made straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine

He is currently being hunted over the 
audacious heist in which a gang of thieves took just 120 seconds to steal
artefacts worth £2million from a museum – after breaking in by cutting a
hole in a brick wall.

Wanted: Durham Police also released a photo of Adrian Stanton who is sought over the heist

The 'highly organised' criminals spent
40 minutes using specialist tools to force a 2ft by 3ft gap into the 
exterior of the building.

But once they were inside, they needed only two minutes to snatch the valuable relics and flee.

Durham Police named Lee Wildman, also 
known as Jason or Lee Green, 35, and Adrian Stanton, 32, from Walsall, 
West Midlands, as the two men they want to trace.

Both men will be aware they are wanted by police, Det Supt Adrian Green, who is leading a 40-strong team of detectives, said.

After the thieves had broken through 
the brickwork, they headed straight for the Malcolm MacDonald gallery, 
where they stole an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain 
figurine which were on display in separate cabinets.

The bowl dates from 1769 and has a Chinese poem written inside, while the figurine, of fairies in a boat, stands at about 12in.

Both are from the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial dynasty, which ended a century ago.

Detective Superintendent Adrian Green said: 'It seems very clear that this was a well-planned, highly organised break-in.

'They have spent around 40 minutes 
creating a hole in an outside wall and when it has been big enough, they
have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items.

The figurine is of seven fairies in a boat and stands about 12in (30cm) high. Police believe the artefacts were stolen to order

Planned job: Police said they were sure it was planned for quite some time and believe the artefacts were stolen to order, 'for someone who has already identified a potential market'

The gang spent 40 minutes making a hole in an outside wall at Durham University's Oriental Museum before swiping two highly valuable artefacts

'I am sure this job has been planned 
for quite some time and I would think the artefacts have been stolen to 
order, for someone who has already identified a potential market.' There
are fears the Chinese artefacts may already have been spirited abroad 
to be sold.

Police have arrested five people in connection with the incident last Thursday, all from the West Midlands.

Officers also want to question Adrian 
Mark Stanton, 32, and Lee Paul Wildman, 35, who are believed to have 
gone on the run. Wildman, who is from Walsall and also uses the names 
Jason Green or Lee Green, was interviewed at the weekend but his present
location is unknown. Stanton's last known address was also in Walsall.

Mr Green said: 'They will both be 
aware of our interest and if anyone knows where they have gone, I would 
ask them to contact the police or ring Crimestoppers.'

Three men aged 56, 41 and 36, and a 34-year-old woman, were arrested at the weekend and released on bail.

Another man, aged 27 and from Walsall, is under arrest and being interviewed at a police station in County Durham.

A Durham Police spokesman said: 
'Durham Constabulary and the CPS have a very good working relationship. 
It’s not correct to say, as some have, that a suspect was released in 
error. 

'At the time we were both working 
exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging, fast moving 
conditions. We are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold 
people without charge.

'We will not be disclosing a detailed 
sequence of events; it's neither appropriate nor productive to focus on 
this one issue when we are concentrating our efforts on arresting those 
we believe to be responsible for an extremely serious crime and 
recovering priceless artefacts.'
