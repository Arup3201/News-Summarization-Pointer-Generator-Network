The perp: Charles Phillip Wilson, 47, was arrested for breaking into a stranger's home and masturbating on her bed

A 47-year-old man was arrested after he was caught masturbating in a stranger's Southeast Portland, Oregon, home on Monday.

According to police, the victim came home in the afternoon only to walk in on the perpetrator, Charles Phillip Wilson, pleasuring himself in her bedroom.

Michelle Leeper said when she walked into the house, in the 2500 block of Southeast Pine Street, she noticed a few things were different from the way she left them.

'I just started putting my groceries away
and I went to walk to the bathroom.

'And I
noticed my bedroom door was closed, and it wasn’t when I left,' Leeper told Koin 6 News.

She said she threw the door open and found a man lying on his back in her bed — half-naked.

'I kind of froze and I asked him what he 
was doing here, like in not-so-pleasant words,' Leeper said. 'He told me
to be quiet and I said “I’m getting the neighbor and I’m calling the 
cops”.'

Leeper called 911 at about 1.37pm, according to Sgt. Pete Simpson, a Portland Police Bureau spokesman.

Mr Wilson fled the scene but was later found hiding in a neighbour’s garden, Sgt Simpson told the Oregonian.

Sgt Simpson said Wilson likely got into the house through an open or unlocked sliding door.

Wilson was booked into the Multnomah County Jail on criminal trespass and private indecency charges.
