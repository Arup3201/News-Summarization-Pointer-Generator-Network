Internet fame isn't all it's cracked up to be, as 16-year-old Alex Lee from small town Frisco, Texas learned in the past two weeks.

The high-schooler known across social media as 'Alex from Target' went from just 144 Twitter followers to more than 730,000 after a picture of him working a shift at the store surfaced online. 

That photo generated a popular meme and now 'Alex from Target' is searched more on Google than pop sensation Justin Bieber.

Like any teenager, Alex is enjoying the newfound attention but admits it also has its downfalls. He's bombarded like a celebrity anytime he goes out of his house, which has left his parents frightened for his safety at school and work. They say he's even received death threats.

Insta-fame: Alex Lee of Frisco, Texas became an online sensation two weeks ago when a picture of him working at Target surfaced online and went viral. He is now known simple as 'Alex from Target' 

Alex was working a shift at his local SuperTarget on November when fame hit him out of nowhere. 

'It was just a normal day,' Alex told the New York Times in his second interview, after appearing on the Ellen Show last week.  

Somehow a picture of him scanning and bagging items at his cash register surfaced online, and a teenage girl in Britain posted it on her Twitter account with the caption 'YOOOOOOOOOOO.'

The picture quickly went viral, generating the hastag  #alexfromtarget, and suddenly his Sunday shift got a whole lot busier. 

That afternoon, his line started getting longer and longer and young girls were taking pictures of him while he was ringing up their purchases. Then his manager Molly  came up to show him his picture on Twitter. He was transferred to the stock room for the rest of the today because the attention got so out of hand.

Alex's picture allegedly first surfaced on Tumblr, but went viral worldwide when a teen in Britain posted this pic to her Twitter. Alex says he first started noticing something was up during a shift at Target, when his line got unusually long and girls started approaching him to take pictures 

By the time he clocked out that evening, Alex turned on his phone and was greeted with a slough of text messages from friends about his internet celebrity. At that point he had amassed a fandom of 100,000 followers on Twitter. Confused, he tweeted 'Am I famous now?' 

While Alex has adjusted to the internet fame well, and is more than happy to pose for selfies with locals in his town, the attention can be overwhelming sometimes. Like the night last week that he went to a burger joint with his father after school and had to run out of the restaurant, chased by a throng of female fans. 

'I’ve been in the house the entire time,' he said. 'I’m kind of scared to go in public.'

His newfound celebrity has also exposed him to unwarranted criticism. Alex says he's received negative comments on Twitter from users calling him 'damn ugly' or undeserving of his fame. He's also had his life threatened, and his girlfriend Lindsey has become the target of jealous comments. 

Alex's only TV appearance was on the Ellen Show last week. He says he has received death threats since the photo went viral 

'Alex from target, I'll find you and I will kill you,' one private message read. 

Alex says he was bullied in elementary school, so knows how to ignore 'the hate' but the comments have left his parents genuinely worried about his safety.  

Parents Eric and Marci Fooks also say that their personal information has been leaked online including Social Security numbers, bank accounts and phone records, leading them to contact the police.

The family are now consulting with John Shahibi, the founder of Shots, a selfie-sharing app, to help Alex deal with his fame. Shahidi also works with Justin Bieber.

'The family is only concerned with doing something positive with this opportunity,' Mr Shahidi said.
