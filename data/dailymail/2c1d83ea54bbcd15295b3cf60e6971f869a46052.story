Stranded: Paul Kline and fellow diver Fernando Garcia Puerta were abandoned miles from land when their charter boat left without them

Two terrified divers were left stranded in shark-infested waters when their charter boat disappeared.

Paul Kline and Fernando Garcia Puerta had to cling to a buoy for two hours after surfacing from their late-afternoon dive in the Atlantic Ocean three miles from Miami and finding no trace of their boat.

'We were in shock. We could easily have died,' Kline, 44, told the Miami Herald.

'If night had fallen, the situation would have turned into panic.'

He said they kept talking to each other throughout their ordeal 'to try to keep up our high spirits'.

Mr Kline, a married father of six from
Texas, told WSVN-TV that he could only think about getting back to his 
family while stranded in the water.

He said: 'I wasn't giving up anytime soon.'

Mr Kline and Mr Puerta, a Spanish tourist, were eventually spotted by the crew of a passing yacht and brought safely to shore.

'You could notice a strong feeling of 
relief,' said Elie Trichet, captain of the No Compromise which was 
returning to Miami from the Florida Keys when his passengers saw the
men clutching their diving equipment.

'They had been clinging to that buoy for two hours hoping somebody would rescue them.'

The rescued divers each paid $85 for 
the four-hour adventure in Biscayne Bay, which was meant to include two 
one-hour dives at different locations.

Horror: The terrifying ordeal has been compared to the 2004 film Open Water

Mr Kline said that he initially 
thought there had been a medical emergency aboard the boat, which is why
it was not there when he and Mr Garcia surfaced 55 minutes into the 
first dive after studying coral reef. He said he assumed another boat 
would be sent back for them.

Instead, the other divers on the trip 
had already boarded and the boat was en route to the second dive site 
with the captain unaware he had left the two behind.

Mr Kline said they 
realised after a while that they had been forgotten.

The two, who did not previously know each other, were recovering in Miami today while coastguards launched an investigation.

Sasha Boulanger, owner of South Beach 
Divers, which organised the trip, was due to meet Mr Kline today to apologise.

But he said the incident was the fault of RJ Diving 
Ventures, the boat operators he contracted to take the divers out, and 
not his own company, which he said enjoyed an 'excellent' safety record.

Rescue: The 'No Compromise' was heading back to Miami from Key Largo when it stopped to pick up the stranded divers

'We are the ones who facilitate the trip and connect A with B,' Mr Boulanger told the Miami Herald.

'I must assume a certain degree of 
responsibility, but unfortunately, this falls on (RJ Diving),' he said. 
'They are in control of the divers and their security.'  

The captain of the dive boat, Mike 
Beach, refused to discuss the incident with reporters, saying only: 
'Everybody is OK, no one is hurt, everybody is happy.'

Coast Guard spokeswoman Sabrina Elgammal said: 'The incident is under investigation.'

She added: 'We got a call that the two
people were picked up in the sea and there was no medical harm and they
went back to port.'

Despite stringent safety requirements,
there have been several high-profile episodes of divers being abandoned
by boat operators.

Great save: The divers were plucked out of the sea by rescuers on the yacht 'No Compromise,' which was being operated by Elie Trichet

One of the most famous incidents was made into the 2003 film Open Water.

Americans Tom and Eileen Lonergan 
surfaced from a dive off Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in January 1998 
to discover their boat had gone.

The couple, who were never found, 
scrawled a desperate plea for help on a diver’s slate later found at the
site. It is believed they drowned or were eaten by sharks.

In 2005, British divers Louise Woodger
and Gordon Pratley were rescued in the same area after being missing 
for four hours.

They were found suffering from exposure and hypothermia 
after currents forced them away from their boat.
