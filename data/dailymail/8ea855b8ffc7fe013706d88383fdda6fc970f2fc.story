Imagine being able to design your perfect hotel stay... right down to every last room detail.

Marriott Hotels UK has teamed up with top British TV and sport personalities to create a truly unique guestroom.

Following a public vote online, the winning concept has finally been revealed - and will be used to inspire Marriott in the future when the brand undertakes hotel renovations and new builds.

A dream hotel room includes everything from a hover bed to an in-room fitness station, according to Marriott

The hotel giant enlisted the help of five British tastemakers to design and develop their dream lodgings

TV presenter Katie Piper, England rugby star Danny Care, tech guru Jason Bradbury, chef Luiz Hara, and online blogging sensation Victoria from In The Frow were all enlisted to help.

Each influencer headed up one of five Gen Y 'tribes' grouped together by similar lifestyles, aspirations and travel preferences, to share their vision for the perfect hotel room.

And each one was decidedly unique - from the family-friendly sanctuary created by Katie Piper to Jason's high-tech accommodations full of LED lights and glass walls - but it turns out, that the public's ideal room is really a mix of everything.

TV personality Katie Piper designed a room that offered a tranquil escape for her and her family

Rugby pro Danny Care was inspired by Scandinavian designs for his relaxing, minimalist proposal

Tech guru Jason Bradbury incorporated digital artwork, a hover bed, and LED displays in his room

Super-blogger Victoria of In The Frow designed a room complete with an all-weather balcony and hammock

The London Foodie, Luiz Hara, of course had to include a concealed micro-kitchen in his designs

Must-haves include a hover bed with LED light box headboard (Jason Bradbury), a hot and cold tub (Danny Care), a micro-kitchen (Luiz Hara), a selfie wall to stick those enviable holiday snaps (Victoria from In The Frow) and soothing mood lighting (Katie Piper). 

Other coveted features include a 'tranquil zone' - an area away from technology - as well as a wardrobe wall, a table to control temperature and lighting, a large TV with Netflix and surround sound, WiFi and an in-room atomiser.

The 'room of the future' is on display now at Westfield White City, London, in the main atrium, until November 2 and shoppers will also have the opportunity to win hotel stays and even a Marriott bed.
