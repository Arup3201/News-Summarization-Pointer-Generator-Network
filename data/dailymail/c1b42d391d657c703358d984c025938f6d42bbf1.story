Treasurer Joe Hockey and Australian Greens Leader Christine Milne have become unlikely allies after both spoke up to support senator-elect Ricky Muir's shaky interview on Sunday night.

The Motoring Enthusiasts Party senator-elect was the subject of ridicule following an excruciating weekend interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night, in which he struggled to explain his alliance with the Palmer United Party (PUP).

'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, um, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' Mr Muir said in the interview.

Set to become one of the most powerful players in Australian politics in less than a month, Senator Muir got flustered while talking about his political party's main topic of interest.

But Mr Hockey - not known for mincing his words - and Senator Milne both said the novice politician shouldn't be judged on the interview.

'You've got to treat everyone with the same degree of respect, whether they're the most articulate or whether they're inarticulate, whether they're nervous or whether they're confident,' Mr Hockey said on Tuesday.

'I don't mind someone being nervous. I think it's very human.'

Mike Willesee: Do you understand what balance of power means?Ricky Muir: Yes. It's the potential if... Ah, let's say in this case Labor and the Greens, um. It's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances.Correct answer: A balance of power (in reference to the Senate) is a position held by a minor party, independent or coalition which means their vote is necessary for legislation to be passed.

MW: I don't know what you mean by [aftermarket industry]?RM: The aftermarket industry is the industry, um, that is... [To himself] Take a breath. Can I go out for a minute?Correct answer: The aftermarket automotive industry deals with car parts that are sold to consumers other than vehicle manufacturers (such as Ford or Holden). Aftermarket manufacturers make motor vehicle parts - such as tyres, seats, engines, batteries or brake pads - and sell to car repair shops or directly to consumers. The products are used to replace faulty parts, to modify cars or to maintain the performance of vehicles.

And he thinks Mr Muir could follow in the footsteps of former member for North Sydney 'Silent Billy Jack'.

'As Bob Menzies said at a famous town hall meeting at North Sydney, he said: "I'm the one that does the talking, and Billy does the voting". And I suspect it might be the same with Ricky,' Mr Hockey said.

Senator Milne said Mr Muir's election was simply down to 'a numbers game' but said he deserved sympathy over the interview, which caused some to question how he would represent Victoria in the upper house.

'It's a nerve-wracking time when you go into politics and so, to that extent, of course you have to feel sorry for people who are struggling with it,' Senator Milne told reporters in Hobart.

The bigger question was how Mr Muir got elected with half of one per cent of the primary in the 2013 SA senate race, Senator Milne said.

The long-serving Tasmanian senator said PUP leader Clive Palmer, who Mr Muir will back in a balance-of-power bloc when he begins his six-year term from July, and micro-parties consultant Glenn Druery, who guided the Motorists Enthusiasts Party on preference deals, had questions to answer about his election.

'What you can see is a numbers game going on,' Senator Milne said.

She said Mr Muir had put himself forward for election and now had to represent his state as best he could.

'Everybody who goes into the senate has to undertake to make a serious contribution and I presume that is his commitment to the Australian community,' she said.

Mr Hockey in particular might be reluctant to go too hard on Mr Muir after his boss made a verbal gaffe of his own over the weekend.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott immediately corrected himself after referring to 'Canadia' during an official trip, but audiences back home noted the slip and 'Canadia' was soon trending on Twitter.

Mr Muir, from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, struggled to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate

Veteran Seven reporter Mike Willesee asked Mr Muir to explain what he meant by the 'aftermarket' automobile industry, but the Victorian stumbled with his answer before taking a break.

'There's the aftermarket industry which can be supported ... people that are losing their jobs ... sorry ... can we start that question again?' Mr Muir said.

'There's the aftermarket industry ... which ... um ... sorry, can we go to another question? I've got myself into a fluster.

'The aftermarket industry is the industry that is ... can I go out for a minute?'

After a short break, Mr Muir returns, and Mr Willesee advises him to answer questions as if he's talking to someone at a pub.

Mr Muir, who has maintained his job at a timber mill ahead of the move to Canberra, also struggles to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate.

'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, umm, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' he said.

PUP leader and businessman Clive Palmer on Monday attacked the Sunday Night program's story as 'biased and churlish'.

'Mike Willesee recorded about an hour of a really serious interview with me about political things and other things but he didn't show any of that,' he told ABC radio.

'He doesn't show you all of the footage. Just selective pieces.'
