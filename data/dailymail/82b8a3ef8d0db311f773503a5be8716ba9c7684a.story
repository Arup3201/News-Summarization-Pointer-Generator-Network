David Rudisha is such a perennial winner that even his own coach mocked him when he missed out on gold at last month’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

‘He was saying “how are you silver man?”,’ recalled the greatest two-lap runner of all time.

His coach, the Irish missionary Brother Colm O’Connell, was only teasing. Anyone who appreciates Rudisha’s greatness realises it is not diminished by defeat to Nijel Amos, the 20-year-old Botswanan who was second behind Rudisha at London 2012 in what is widely accepted to have been the greatest 800 metres race in history.

All smiles: David Rudisha is one of the greatest middle-distance runners in history 

Second best: Rudisha was beaten into second place at the Commonwealth Games by Nijel Amos

At Hampden Park, Rudisha was not fully fit. Before March he had not been able to run for 10 months because of a knee injury. But missing out on that Commonwealth title has refocused the Kenyan ahead of Saturday’s Sainsbury’s Birmingham Grand Prix, where he will race over 600m for the first time.

‘The silver medal is what I settled for,’ said Rudisha. ‘It was the best I could do that night and I have to stay positive and learn from that. I know I wasn’t at my best. If I say “I have been out for almost a year and started training very late”, it is always going to be very difficult to be at top form.

‘Of course it’s difficult for me (not to win gold). I have to build up gradually because when you stop, you can easily lose shape. I’m not at my best, but I’m trying to get there.’

Lead: Rudisha was in front of Amos, but a late surge secured Commonwealth Games gold for the Botswanan

Like all great sporting rivals, Rudisha and Amos are intent on using their battle to push the 800m world record lower than the 1min 40.91sec set by Rudisha in the Olympic final two years ago. ‘I don’t care who does it,’ Amos says. ‘I just want us both to run fast.’

Rudisha added: ‘We are looking forward to the coming years and seeing if we can bring down that world record together. It is a tough thing to go for, it needs a lot of preparation, proper training and perfect conditions.’

The world record over the rarely raced 600m is in more immediate threat tomorrow. It currently stands at 1min 12.21sec.

‘I’m planning something around there,’ said Rudisha, 25. It will not be long before he is a golden man again.

The Sainsbury’s Birmingham Grand Prix and IPC Grand Prix final are at Alexander Stadium tomorrow. Tickets at www.britishathletics.org.uk
