Police forced their way onto an Australian ship yesterday after a Mayday call from the captain saying mutineers had seized control of the vessel.

Armed police boarded the Queen of Melbourne mid-morning, freeing the captain and ordering the crew to sail into port at the Bay of Algeciras, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz.

The captain alleged his Pakistani crew had demanded 20 per cent of the profits of the ship and help entering Australia illegally, according to Spanish officials. 

But insiders claimed the crew had acted following an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions.

Mutiny on the high seas: Spanish police forced their way onto the Australian-registered Queen of Melbourne yesterday morning after the captain made a Mayday call alleging that his crew had seized control of the ship

Get ready to be boarded: The ship's Pakistani crewmen can be seen peering over the side at the Spanish policemen as their intercepting vessel draws up alongside. The crew were unarmed

The ship was travelling from Norway, where it had just been bought, towards Australia via the Spanish owned Canary Islands when the crew allegedly mutinied.

The captain, trapped in his cabin, called the ship's owners. They passed on his plea for help to the Australian Maritime Security Operations Centre in Canberra, the Australian capital, who emailed Spanish authorities.

At the same time, the captain made another call from the satellite phone in his cabin to Spanish border and coastal security authorities telling them he'd been expelled from the bridge and the crew had taken control.

Spanish Civil Guard officers made first radio contact with the vessel at dawn. According to a statement from the agency, several crew members tried to masquerade as the real captain over the radio.

Two patrols from the Maritime Service and Public Safety Unit intercepted the vessel and found the crew unarmed.
