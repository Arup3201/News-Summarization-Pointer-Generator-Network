Randy Gregory has admitted to failing a marijuana test at the NFL scouting combine last month.

One of the most talented edge rushers in the upcoming draft, Gregory starred for Nebraska at outside linebacker for the past two seasons.

'I blame myself,' Gregory told NFL media's Kimberly Jones from his Atlanta home. 'And I know it sounds cliche, but there's really no one else I can blame.'

The 22-year-old found out about the failed test a fortnight ago on the phone to his father. He had asked him to open an envelope which he mistakenly believed to be an invitation to the draft in Chicago.

Randy Gregory impressed at the combine, running the 40 in 4.64 secs with a 125 inch broad jump

Gregory had 17.5 sacks in his two years at Nebraska and is one of the most coveted linebackers in the draft

Many experts have the 22-year-old as a top-five pick. At 6ft 5in he is versatile enough to rush the quarterback or operate in coverage, but in a class loaded with pass rushers, he spoke of his concerns.

'Am I worried? Yeah, I'm worried,' he said. 'At the same time, I'm confident. I know I'm going to be all right in the end.'

Gregory told Jones that he hasn't smoked marijuana since December, and that he did not use other recreational drugs. 

'I don't wake up every day saying, I'd really love to go smoke,' he said. 'It's not a struggle for me every day (now), it really isn't. In the past, hell yeah, it's been a struggle. It really has been.' 

Gregory's issues with the drug were well-documented. He failed two drug tests in January and April in 2014 at Nebraska.

'I was worse at Nebraska than I've ever been at any other time of my life. But I know how I am now. I think if teams really look at how I am now more so than the past, they'll see I'm making strides to get better, as a person and as a player,' he said. 

Despite the red flags, 29 NFL teams spoke to Gregory at the combine and if they did not know of his off-field issues, Gregory made them aware during the interviews.

Gregory will enter the NFL in the first stage of the league's substance abuse programme.

'This incident right now is a step toward ending my career. The last thing I want to do is fail another drug test and be out of the league.'
