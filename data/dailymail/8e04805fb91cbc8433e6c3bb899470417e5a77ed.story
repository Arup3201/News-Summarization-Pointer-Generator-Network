These two African elephants got themselves into a right old tangle during an encounter on a Kenyan game reserve.

Tusk to tusk with their trunks intertwined, the scene could be mistaken for a playful show of affection between the two majestic males.

In fact the elephants were locked in a battle for mating rights after both setting their sights on the same female on the Masai Mara National Reserve.

Trunk-twister: The two African elephants battled for 20 minutes on Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve

Photographer Dmitry Stepanov, who captured the shots of the two elephants' tangled trunks, said the struggle between the pair lasted 20 minutes.

The 32-year-old described the elephants grappling with their trunks 'like sumo wrestlers', but added that he was surprised at how tame the face-off between the two enormous animals was.

'They were fighting for a female and it looked similar to a sumo fight,' said Mr Stepanov, who took the photographs from the safety of a car parked 100 metres away from the elephants.

'However it was not very aggressive and they did not make much noise.'

Although the two animals' battle for dominance went on for 20 minutes, it seems there was no clear victor.

'In the end, I think it ended without a winner and neither received injuries,' the photographer said.

'In fact, they looked a little sleepy and it looked more like a game than a fight. However, our guide told us it was a fight.'

Mating among African elephants occurs every four years and can take place at any time of the year.

The elephants live in herds comprised of related females and their young. Male elephants leave the herd when they reach adolescence and maintain loose relationships with other males as they mature.

In later life they live alone, approaching females only during breeding season.
