Under-fire boss Paul Lambert has dismissed suggestions he is feeling the pressure at goalless Aston Villa after another defeat.

They slipped to a 2-0 loss at home to Liverpool on Saturday and have not scored in eight hours and 42 minutes of action.

Villa are the lowest scorers in the Barclays Premier League with just 11 goals in 22 games and have won just twice in their last 18 league games.

But Lambert, who won the Champions League as a player with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, insisted he knows how to handle the heat.

'Listen, if you saw me before the European Cup final that was pressure,' he said, after Villa drew a fifth straight league blank.

'I thought my a*** was going to fall out of my shorts.

'No, no. Pressure? High-level football? I'm fortunate, I've been at the top level playing in European Cup finals and things like that, so pressure is part and parcel of my nature. It's part and parcel of the game of football.

'You have to handle it. I'm strong enough to handle it.'

Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert won it for Liverpool to underline Villa's struggles although a planned protest, against chairman Randy Lerner and Lambert from the home fans, failed to make an impact.

The supporters may be unhappy, yet there were only muted chants against Lambert, and the manager insisted the club cannot compete on the level it used to.

He said: 'This club has been embroiled in major things - European Cups, league titles, all that sort of thing.

'The '82 team is probably the greatest side this club will ever see. Those guys will quite rightly always be well respected at this football club for what they achieved.

'But now it is what it is. I don't moan about it.'
