A German backpacker who got lost in the Australian outback survived for nearly a month by eating flies and insects.

Daniel Dudzisz was attempting an epic 2,485 mile (4,000km) journey on foot from New South Wales to Uluru via Queensland.

But the 26-year-old became stranded between Windorah and Jundah in central-west Queensland after being cut off by floodwaters.Â

Rescued: Daniel Dudzisz, has been found after becoming stranded in the Queensland outback

He was finally found near Coopers Creek by two men yesterday afternoon.

Police Inspector Mark Henderson told the ABC Mr Dudzisz became lost and was stranded in bushland for about 10 days between two flooded sections of the Barcoo River.

'If you hadn't heard it with your own ears, not that I have but my officers have, they said they certainly wouldn't have believed it,' he said.

'He joked about never going hungry in the Australian outback because of the amount of flies you can eat for their protein apparently.

'He had some baked beans and cereal when he left Windorah and exhausted that pretty quickly, and said he'd been eating flies ever since.'

Mr Dudzisz described his travel method as 'quite hardcore' in an interview with the Warrego Watchman in early February.

However, he was certain he could handle it, after being homeless for two years.

The plan: Mr Dudzisz started his journey in NSW, was found in Windorah QLD and said he will make it on foot to Uluru.

'What I enjoy about the walking most is just how much closer nature feels when you cross and experience it like this,' he told the publication.

'And all the little unexpected encounters and adventures that tend to accumulate along such a journey.'

However police believe the man, who is diabetic, was under-prepared for his expedition and were concerned about his insulin medication not being properly stored.

When talking to the ABC, Inspector Henderson said Mr Dudzisz remains determined to continue his mission and has agreed to keep to main roads.

'He understands the risks and is disappointed and regretful that we had been looking for him and caused people to be looking for him.'
