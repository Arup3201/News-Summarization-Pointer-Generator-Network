The captain of a sinking oil tanker off the coast of Japan is missing and four other crew members are in hospital with serious burns after the vessel caught fire and erupted in flames off the coast of Japan.

Thick smoke billowed from the 1000-tonne Shoko-Maru, 450km west of Tokyo. The ship had just unloaded its cargo at a port near Hyogo prefecture.

Emergency crews used hoses to douse the fierce blaze, which started when a spark from a grinder ignited oil on board on Thursday.

Four crew members were taken to hospital with severe burns, while the remaining three were being assessed for injuries. The Coast Guard said it held 'grave fears' for the captain, who is still missing.

Akihiro Komura, an official from Hiroshima-based shipping firm Syoho Shipping, said seven of the eight Japanese crew were accounted for, but the fate of the captain was not yet known.

'The ship unloaded crude oil at a port in Hyogo prefecture and the tanker was virtually empty when the accident occurred,' he said.

'I heard that a crew member was using a grinder to remove paint and that seems to have triggered the blast, which we believe could have occurred when the remnants of the oil caught fire.' All the crew were Japanese nationals, he said.

News of the incident caused Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to interrupt debate in parliament. 'In waters off Hyogo (prefecture), a tanker has exploded and is currently in flames,' he told lawmakers.

Himeji port is one of a number that sit along the Inland Seto Sea coast, where there are numerous pockets of heavy industry. The city itself is a popular tourist destination, and is home to one of Japan's finest feudal castles.
