Adam Gemili led the men's 4x100 metres team to glory on the final day of the European Championships, securing the British team a record gold medal haul.

This has been a wonderful week in Zurich for Great Britain, who came into this race already guaranteed to be returning home with more medals than their previous best of 19 in Barcelona four years ago.

Now, though, they have also overtaken the record of nine gold medals set in Budapest in 1998 thanks to a wonderful performance by the 100m relay team.

Having already seen Mo Farah and the men's 4x400m team triumph on the final day, the quartet of James Ellington, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Richard Kilty and Gemili followed suit at the Stadion Letzingrud.

Avoiding the baton errors that have so often proved problematic in the past, they did not look in danger despite being without 100m champion James Dasaolu and fellow sub-10 sprinter Chijindu Ujah.

Gemili, gold medallist in the 200m, brought the team home in a European-leading 37.93 seconds, coming close to the previous record of 37.73secs which has stood since the 1999 World Championships.

While the relay runners were doing their thing, Farah was celebrating adding the 5000m title to his 10,000m one.

'It was amazing to have my family here and to have my kids on the track with me, kissing me and saying 'daddy won',' Farah said.

'It's the first time my young twins have properly watched me race so it's great. History's very important to me and I always hope to make my country proud.

'There's been some down times but two golds here is great and now I hope to get ready to face the big guys next year at the IAAF World Championships.

'What I've achieved over the years means that the rest of the field let me do my thing. The race went well, I went to the front so it was good. My distance double's great for my country and thanks to everyone's support over the years.'

British team-mate Vernon had hoped to dash Farah's long-distance double, but could only add bronze to his 10,000m silver.

'I feel I almost missed out in the 10,000m when I got silver, so I came into this thinking I won't let that happen again,' he told the BBC.

'I had a plan to win the gold but it got to the last 800m and the wheels slowly started to come off. I was surprised I held on for bronze in the end.

'But to get two medals is brilliant. I wish one of them could have been gold but when you are racing against the best you have to accept a silver and a bronze is good.'
