Scientists have discovered the first new river dolphin species in almost 100 years.

They have named the new breed, which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world, ‘Araguaia’, after the Brazilian river where it was found.

Writing in the journal Plos One, the researchers say the new species, the first discovered since 1918, diverged from other South American river species more than two million years ago.

Scientists have named the breed, which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world, ¿Araguaia¿, (pictured) after the Brazilian river where it was found. It is the first new species of river dolphin discovered since 1918

They estimate there are 1,000 of the creatures living in the Araguaia river basin.

River dolphins are incredibly rare. Out of the five species, three are on the critically endangered Red List, and the scientists believe the Araguaia dolphins should join them.

They tend to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers, unlike the short-nosed sea dolphins.

Dr Tomas Hrbek, from the Federal University of Amazonas, said: ‘It was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked. It is very exciting.’

The closest relation to the new breed, the Amazon or pink river dolphin, is said to be the most intelligent of all the river species.

The scientists say there are some differences in the number of teeth and they suspect the Araguaia river species is smaller, but most of the clues to the difference were found in their genes.

Dr Hrbek said the dolphins are at risk because they clash with local fishermen.

‘The dolphins are at the top of the line, they eat a lot of fish,’ he said.

‘They rob fishing nets so the fishermen tend to not like them, people shoot them.’

River dolphins are very rare. Out 
of the 5 species, 3 are on the critically endangered Red List, 
and scientists believe the Araguaia should join it
