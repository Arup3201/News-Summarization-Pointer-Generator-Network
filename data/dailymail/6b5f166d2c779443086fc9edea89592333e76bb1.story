Teresa Marsden's daughter has been missing for almost one year but her mother just refuses to give up on her.

Ms Marsden is so convinced that she's traveled more than 1000km along Australia's east coast posting 'missing' posters in the hope that someone, somewhere knows where her daughter may be hiding.

Ms Marsden said the fact Renae was not a party girl or 'into drinking or drugs' has convinced her that she's still alive somewhere in Australia.

Renae Marsden was excited about her upcoming 21st birthday when she was last seen by her family at their Glenhaven home in Sydney's northwest on August 5, 2013. She would have turned 21 on October 15.

Renae then headed to dinner with work friends in Watsons Bay, which she never made, and her last communication was a text message to her mum telling her she loved her and she was her best friend.

'It was just a general message. She was upset but it wasn't like a goodbye or anything,' Ms Marsden said.

'I let it go - I tried to ring her but her phone kept going to voice mail.

'But this is not the first message Renae sent me like that - it's not a message that was out of the ordinary - alarm bells didn't go off.'

Encouraged by a friend, Ms Marsden notified police about an hour after Renae sent the text message that she was concerned about her daughter.

'She was going to dinner and never came home.

'I would still look for her if she was, but I wouldn't be going to this extent because I'd figure she would just come home when she was ready,' she said.

'It was very out of the ordinary for her to disappear,' she said.

In their search, police tracked Renae to Watsons Bay in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where they later found her car locked.

An investigation did not find any prints on the car or signs of anything suspicious, but Renae's parents did think it was strange that her car, which was normally full or personal items and clothes, was completely empty.

Renae's phone and keys have never been found.

Since Christmas Ms Marsden, who has three other young children, has posted hundreds of 'missing' flyers in coastal towns cities including Chinderah, on NSW Queensland border, Mooloolaba, on the Queensland Sunshine Coast, and as far inland as Moree in outback NSW. 

'I've been trying cafes anywhere and everywhere - doing all up the east coast north of Sydney,' she said. 'I mail cafes the posters to get as many posters out as possible.'

'I went up to Byron Bay and the Gold Coast at Easter to look around for her and I plan to go back to Byron and surround areas in a couple of weeks.'

Ms Marsden said she believes her daughter could be hiding due to a violent person who she was scared of.

'She was frightened two weeks prior to her disappearance... but she told me not to worry,' she said. 

Teresa Marsden has sent 'missing' posters to cafes along Australia's east coast in the hope of finding information about her daughter Renae's whereabouts

Ms Marsden has used her daughter's fears to determine her search areas.

'I don't poster Sydney, because if she's done a runner, she's going to go elsewhere, so I'm heaidng up north,' she said.

'I started with Coffs Harbour - it was just an area I'd chosen to get 100s of flyers out.'

In the months since she has been posting the flyers across Queensland and NSW, Ms Marsden said she had mostly received calls from people saying they wanted to help by putting posters up - and a few psychics.

'I had a postie lady asking me to send them up to her so she could put them out in the mail,' she said.

Only one person has contacted Ms Marsden in regards to a sighting but she questions the validity of this information.

'He said he'd seen Renae but I asked for evidence and never heard back. He said he'd seen her but didn't know where so I said: "When you figure it out get back to me",' and I left it with him,' she said.

Ms Marsden said 'hope' was driving her search.

'They say a mum knows if something happens to their kid and I don't believe she would have taken her own life,' she said.

NSW Police are now preparing a report for the coroner, but Ms Marsden does not believe her daughter was dead.

'It's different if you see a body, but here's too much evidence to suggest she's alive. There's not evidence to suspect she's not here,' she said.

'She was at her cousin's 21st birthday two days before (she disappeared) having an absolute ball. She loved her cousin.

'There was no change in demeanour, we were having a good night.'

'Two weeks prior we went to the Pink concert together - we were a very close family, she was very close to me.'

Ms Marsden added that Renae was also making plans for her own upcoming 21st birthday - on October 15 - and was planning to study in the future. 'None of it makes sense,' she said.

Desperate to find her young daughter, Ms Marsden said she still has hope of finding her alive and well

A NSW Police Media spokeswoman confirmed police had presented their evidence to the coroner.

'Police are now awaiting the coroner's determination and recommendations,' she said.

The information from the coroner will be used to asses if police investigations need to continue and if so, anything that might still need to be looked at.

As a teenager, Renae worked in a hairdressing salon two shops down from the newsagency owner by the Lin family in Epping.

After five members of the Lin family were murdered in 2009, police spoke to Renae about the family.

'She knew the family quite well so police spoke to her,' Ms Marsden said. 'She never socialised with them but she used to chat to them when she would go in a few times a week to buy magazines for the salon.

'She was quite distraught by the murders because she had known them for quite a long time.'
