A Gold Coast father who has publicly fought an incurable brain tumour for more than five years has made the heartbreaking decision to give up his battle to spend whatever time he has left with his young family.

Rome Torti has fought an aggressive form of brain cancer on-and-off since 2009 - the same amount of time he's been married and the entirety of his son's life.

But the 31-year-old revealed on Thursday that moving forward he was going to embrace each day he has left with wife Rachel and son Ryder.

Rome Torti, who has fought an aggressive form of brain cancer on-and-off since 2009, has decided to stop fighting to make the most of the time he has left

'Rome has been battling his guts out for the past five and a half years... He has constantly been juggling medicine, treatments, supplements, therapies and operations,' a post on his supporter Facebook page said.

'Rome recently had a big fight for his health and came through with miraculous results. At the end of that battle, he also made a big decision. That decision was to switch from fight to peace.'

Mr Torti underwent major surgery two days before Christmas last year so renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo could remove the Giloblatoma Multiforme Grade 4 malignant brain tumour and buy the young father some time.

But the tumour, which had begun to wrap around Mr Torti's brain stem, was one of the worst Dr Teo had seen and the operation left him with paralysis.

Mr Torti, a well known skate photographer on the Gold Coast, had already tried chemotherapy, radiation, natural therapies, supplements, oxygen therapy and even an expensive experimental German treatment called oncothermia, which he planned to try once more this year in Germany.

'He and his family have spent all their free time and energy fighting against a tumour that was supposed to take him years ago,' the Facebook page post said.

Rome and Rachel had sold their house and car and cashed in their savings and superannuation to help fund the rehabilitation, treatment and medical bills over the past five years

'He has won that fight because he has had days, weeks, months and years with his precious family. Memories that will never disappear.

'Today and each day forward, Rome is embracing being with his family, under the case of the amazing palliative nursing team - waking up to cuddles from Ryder, listening to his wife Rachel laugh, getting huge hugs from his friends and family.'

An online fundraising campaign received more than $100,000 in donations, with dozens of celebrities including World Champion surfers Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson also making contributions.

But his supporters said on Thursday that fundraising had ceased.

'We cannot express enough how much your support and generosity has meant to Rome. He is absolutely devastated to step away from his plans for Germany but he knows he has done so having given it everything he had to get there.

'Rome is making the most of every moment - as usual - and still with a smile on his face.

'(He) knows it takes a lot of strength to let go of one battle and switch focus. But maybe it's made a little easier when the new focus – family, peace, gratitude and love – has a pretty damn good view.'
