The first commercial passenger flight from Key West to Cuba in 50 years has landed in Havana, finally reuniting the two islands separated by just 90 miles of water.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave the final approval for the flight on Monday morning and the nine-passenger aircraft departed 90 minutes later at 10 a.m. from Key West International Airport.

The first flight of the short route – which could allow residents to fly to Havana for lunch and be home in Key West in time for dinner – finally took off despite being approved by federal officials back in October 2011.

Charter operators said they had trouble getting all of the required approvals from U.S. and Cuban authorities.

They have also struggled with capacity issues. Key West is currently only approved to process 10 passengers and crew from Cuba at a time.

Key West International Airport director Peter Horton said: ‘This is just a test run. Whether this is going to come and be a regular service I don't believe has been determined yet.’

Cuba and Key West have a long and interwoven history. Before the 1959 revolution, there was regular flight and ferry service to the island.

The Cessna Conquest II aircraft departed the Florida island carrying nine passengers, five of which planned to participate in a licensed ‘people-to-people’ trip focusing on Cuba's culture and environment organized by the Florida Keys Tropical Research Ecological Exchange Institute.

The Obama administration re-instituted 
the cultural exchange licenses in 2011 allowing organizations to take 
U.S. citizens to the island for educational activities that promote 
understanding and exchange with ordinary Cubans.

The Key West travelers are scheduled to meet with Cubans at botanical gardens, organic farms and cultural centers.

Carolann Sharkey, the institute's trip organizer, said: ‘We're doing some really meaningful things there, working with botanical gardens, scientists, researchers, all the people there to help preserve their environment and ecology.’

Key West Mayor Craig Cates flew to Cuba with the group, but returned Monday without venturing beyond the Havana airport terminal.

Mr Cates said: ‘We haven't had flights over there in 50 years.

'It's going to be great for the city of Key West - cultural exchange, historic exchange, to be able to go back and forth directly from Key West.

‘We're closer to Cuba than Miami.’ 

The milestone flight comes just weeks after Cuba announced that it will ease restrictions on car imports for the first time in half a century, marking the end of an era that made icons of the island's vintage automobiles.

The official newspaper Granma said the decision to allow cars to be imported for sale at market prices on the island was taken by Cuba's council of ministers.

It said the decision will gradually 
free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles- automobiles, vans, 
trucks and motorcycles- and end the practice of granting some Cubans 
special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege.

The changes are a long-awaited element of President Raul Castro's attempts to gradually liberalize Cuba's Soviet-style economy.

The government in September 2011 allowed Cubans and foreigners living on the island to sell their used cars to one another.
