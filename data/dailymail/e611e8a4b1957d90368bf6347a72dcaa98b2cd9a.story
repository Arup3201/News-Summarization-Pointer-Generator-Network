If you’ve arranged a romantic meal at a swanky restaurant but can’t tell a Pinot Noir from a Merlot, there’s a device that could spare you your blushes – and impress your other half.

An app for smartphones promises to match your meal with the perfect wine.

Developed by a lecturer in wine studies from University College Birmingham, the app requires users to simply type in the food they are about to eat and the most suitable wine is recommended.

Helping hand: Lecturer Amy Hollier who has designed an app for matching wine with food

Creator Amy Hollier said she hoped the app, called Wine Find, would put a stop to the snobbery surrounding wine.

For 69p and the investment of a small amount of time, it is possible to transform your knowledge of grape varieties and drinking styles in order to get the best out of the dining experience.

Amy Hollier's app provides a wine for almost every conceivable dish. You can also search by wine to find the right dish to go with your selected bottle. Here are some examples:

FURRED GAME (including venison, hare, wild boar and rabbit: The app suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah-based Cornas from the Rhone

PINK CHAMPAGNE Best food pairings  include summer pudding and raspberry pavlova.

OCTOPUS For the eight-armed sea creature, Spain’s albariqo and viura get the nod from Amy.

FISH AND CHIPS Try a Muscadet or maybe a New Zealand Riesling.

LIQUORICE Should you crave the traditional sweet, zinfandel will match it perfectly, according to the app.

BLACK PEPPER Like to add heat to your meat with the ground-up seasoning, the best options are peppery  shiraz, grenache or gruner veltliner;

CINNAMON Craving the spice or fancy a sticky bun? Then pair it with a tawny port or Madeira

Amy, a former operations manager at 
Simpsons restaurant in Edgbaston, is a food service lecturer at 
University College Birmingham and takes wine studies and a senior role 
in training budding waiters and waitresses in front of house service.

The app, developed in partnership with Halesown-based Smartphone Media, works as both a training tool for hospitality students, a point of reference for industry professionals and a bank of knowledge for anyone who loves food and wine but isn’t sure how to get the best out of both.

The beauty of having a ‘portable’ app is that diners can check for recommendations while sitting in a restaurant.

If you don’t want to let anyone else in on where your amazing knowledge of the flavours and the food-matching potential of sangiovese, petit verdot and mourvhdre comes from, simply excuse yourself from the table, nip to the loos and hit Wine Find on your iPhone.

Amy saw a gap in the market after discovering that the majority of wine apps were American-based.

They were great at matching zinfandel to hot dogs but not so helpful with recommending what to glug with rabbit stew.

Amy’s app, incidentally, has a comprehensive section of ‘furred game’ (as well as ‘feathered game’) including venison, hare, wild boar and rabbit (for which she suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah-based Cornas from the Rhone).

Explaining her motivation for the project, Amy says: ‘People are always phoning me or texting me and saying ‘What is a nice bottle of wine?’ and ‘What will it go with?’ and I thought there must be a way round it.’

Ask the expert: The app, shown here on an iPad screen, lets you pick either wines or foods to find parings for

It took six months to collate the 
information for the app, which was launched last month. Amy says she was
under pressure to make sure Wine Find is 100 per cent accurate and 
up-to-date as it is branded by University College Birmingham and will be
used as a teaching aid and revision guide by students.

The app’s main focus is to provide a comprehensive guide to matching wine with food - and food with wine.

There is an ‘Ask The Expert’ feature, which allows users to email Amy and get personalised suggestions, and you can create your own wine label library and upload the pictures and your comments directly to Facebook or Twitter.

Amy, who will be regularly updating the app, recognises that teaching wine studies is a ‘minefield’ and has no time for condescension.

‘There is a lot of snobbery,’ she says. ‘Some people who know a bit about wine reel off loads of information and they baffle you.

‘But wine should be accessible. Wine is about socialising and enjoying what you are drinking. A lot of effort goes into making wine so it is nice to find out more about it.’

Prof Ray Linforth, UCB principal, who backed Amy’s project, says: ‘Alongside being a fun, lifestyle app for wine enthusiasts, Wine Find will be a very useful educational teaching tool to help hospitality students improve their knowledge and ultimately enhance their confidence when advising diners and creating menus.’
