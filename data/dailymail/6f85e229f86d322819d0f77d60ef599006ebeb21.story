If they could speak, each of these dogs would be asking for just one thing: a loving home.

The heart-melting strays and unwanted pets are among thousands currently in the care of Britain’s biggest canine charity, the Dogs Trust.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that in 2012 the RSPCA destroyed 3,400 animals for ‘non-medical’ reasons, such as lack of kennel space.

The Dogs Trust pledges never to destroy a healthy dog. But as its Christmas ban on rehoming – introduced to stop pets being given as unwanted presents – comes  to an end, the charity is desperate to find new homes for its animals.

The Dogs Trust says it is busier than ever because the recession has forced people to give up their pets for economic reasons. Last year, 12,822 dogs were rehomed, up 7.6 per cent on 2011.

‘Sometimes owners just can’t afford to care for their dog any more and call us, but there are also a lot of cases where someone has to downsize to smaller or rented accommodation and can’t keep a dog any more,’ said a spokesman.

Emma Taylor, of the Dogs Trust rehoming centre in Harefield, Middlesex, said the charity undertakes stringent tests to make sure families and their homes are suitable.

She said: ‘When someone comes looking for a dog, we make sure they bring the whole family and meet the dog at least twice. We also arrange a home visit to ensure their home is suitable. It takes about ten days.

‘We also advise people that if they’ve got a house move or a new baby on the way, they should wait until after that,  so everything’s settled down before they take a new dog.’
