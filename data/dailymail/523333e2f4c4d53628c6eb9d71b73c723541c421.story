A pensioner found dead in a road on Christmas Day has been named locally as Jim Smith, who was in his 80s.

It is not yet known why Mr Smith, who 
lived in sheltered accommodation, was out on his own in freezing 
temperatures late at night.

Brenda Shirley, resident coordinator 
at Shakespeare Complex where Mr Smith lived, was woken by detectives at 
4.30am yesterday, alerting her to Mr Smith's death.

‘He was a very nice gentleman, people all got on with him. We are all in shock,’ she said.

A 22-year-old man on suspicion of being unfit to drive through drink or drugs remained in custody yesterday.

Specialist teams from Staffordshire Police examined the scene to piece together the circumstances of the tragic incident.

A
 force spokesman said: ‘Specially-trained police officers are with the 
family of the elderly local man who died as a result of this tragic 
incident.

‘They are being supported and kept informed about the progress of the investigation.

‘The
 22-year-old man arrested in connection with this incident remains in 
police custody and will be questioned by officers as the investigation 
progresses.

‘We want to thank everyone affected by the road closures for their understanding and support at this difficult time.’

He added: ‘The 22-year-old man arrested in connection with this incident remains in police custody.’
