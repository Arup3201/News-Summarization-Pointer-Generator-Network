Steve Bruce admitted injuries to Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez place extra importance on his pursuit of Jermain Defoe – but suggested a deal to bring the Toronto forward to Hull may be too expensive.

Jelavic needs a scan to assess his knee problem, while Hernandez is out for a month with a groin injury. Forwards Sone Aluko and Gaston Ramirez are also on the sidelines.

‘There’s been a lot spoken about Jermain Defoe,’ said Bruce. ‘I, like (West Brom boss) Tony Pulis and (Leicester manager) Nigel Pearson and all the people, would like a Jermain Defoe. The numbers might cause a problem. It might be just beyond us.

‘The one thing you don’t want to do is gamble. We’ve seen all sorts of clubs get into a financial mess by pushing the boat out. But if there’s someone who can make a difference I’ll be knocking the door down like I always have done.

‘We’ve got to get an individual who can make a difference.’
