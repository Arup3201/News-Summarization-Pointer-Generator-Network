Luis Suarez will not be dropped by adidas despite his four-month ban for biting an opponent at the World Cup.

The Uruguay striker signed for Barcelona last week in a £75million move from Liverpool.

But he will not return to action until the end of October following his attack on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini.

There had been speculation that several sponsors could terminate their links with Suarez, but adidas boss Herbert Hainer has confirmed his company will keep faith with the 27-year-old.

‘We will continue to work with Luis Suarez,’ he told German agency SID.

‘But we will talk with him and his management about what we expect of him on and off the pitch.’

Hainer called Suarez ‘one of the best strikers in the world’ and added: ‘It’s not for nothing that FC Barcelona put him under contract.

‘But his behaviour in the match against Italy was not acceptable. That is why the Fifa penalty is justified and you can’t sugarcoat that or tolerate it.’

Haider noted ‘how much pressure the players in such a World Cup are under’ and said ‘furthermore, he apologised’.
