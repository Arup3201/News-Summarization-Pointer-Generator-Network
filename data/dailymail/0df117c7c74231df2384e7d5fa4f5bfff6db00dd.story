The Tory party has hired the election guru who returned Barack Obama to the White House to help David Cameron to win in 2015.

Jim Messina will offer high level strategy advice to the Conservative party, including winning the battle for votes on Twitter and Facebook.

The recruitment of a senior Democrat aide is a major blow to Labour, which has been without an election co-ordinator for a month.

Guru: Jim Messina, who headed Barack Obama's successful re-election campaign last year, is to bring his expertise to the UK as an adviser to the Conservatives

In a sign that the Tory party is 
already on an election footing ahead of May 2015, Mr Messina has been 
brought in to repeat his success in securing President Obama’s 
re-election against a grim economic backdrop.

He
 is expected to advise Tory election boss Lynton Crosby, the Australian 
strategist who has ordered ministers to ‘get the barnacles off the boat’
 and focus on issues which matter to voters.

Mr
 Cameron has brushed aside criticism that lobbyist Mr Crosby has clients
 including tobacco firms, while the coalition has dropped plans for 
plain cigarette packaging.

Senior Tory sources claimed the deal with Mr Messina, who will remain based in the US, is evidence that Mr Obama would like to see Mr Cameron, rather than Mr Miliband, win the 2015 election.

Mr Messina, who is working solely on the election campaign, and not on party policy, will report directly to Mr Cameron’s Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, and Tory co-chairmen Grant Shapps and Lord Feldman.

Sources said he ‘does not come cheap’ although he has ‘not yet’ cost the party £1million.

Special relationship: David Cameron is delighted at recruiting Jim Messina, who led the campaign to re-elect Barack Obama last year

Tory officials said Mr Messina has 
been secretly working for the party for several months and has advised 
Mr Shapps on how to set up a group of 2,000 volunteers who will storm 
into marginal seats during the election campaign.

Last night Mr Messina confirmed his role with the party. He said: ‘I have long admired Prime Minister Cameron.

‘While I will not be moving to 
London, nor will I be managing any type of day-to-day political 
operations, I will be offering  strategic campaign advice leading up to 
2015.’

Boss: Australian Lynton Crosby will run the election campaign, with advice from Mr Messina

The Conservative is aligned to the 
more right-wing Republican party in the US, but Mr Cameron has been keen
 to play up his close ties and friendship with the Obama administration.

Many in the Labour party will be privately deeply disappointed to see a Democrat working for the Tories.

Two years ago Team Miliband was delighted to hold talks with President Obama at Buckingham Palace.

The President stressed to the Labour leader the ‘importance of having an optimistic sense of national mission’.

In the mid-1990s, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair met a young Bill Clinton to plot how Labour could return to power after 18 years in opposition.

But Tom Watson quit as Labour's general election co-ordinator last month at the height of the row over his union links and claims Unite had sought to influence candidate selection and party policy.

Veteran Labour MP George Mudie yesterday admitted he had no idea what his own party's policy was on education, welfare or health and warned Mr Miliband was 'hesitant' and 'confused'.

Mr Messina served as President Obama’s deputy chief of staff, when he was described as ‘the most powerful person in Washington you've never heard of’.

He later moved to head the Obama re-election machine, where against rising unemployment and grim US economic figures the incumbent president went on to beat Mitt Romney in 2012.

Mr Messina’s team gathered meticulous 
data on voters to help activists better target their political messages,
 mobilised supporters through Facebook and Twitter and drummed up 
millions of small donations via social media.

Mr Messina will be working with a rather smaller budget than the billion-dollar Obama campaign, for which enlisted the help of the CEOs of Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook on information-gathering and reaching voters, as well as director Steven Spielberg on how to capture the public’s attention and Vogue editor Anna Wintour on merchandise.

David Cameron’s 2010 campaign was run by Steve Hilton, George Osborne and his former head of communications Andy Coulson amid claims they disagreed about its direction.
