A top Brazilian police officer who 'exuded testosterone' has shocked colleagues by taking a long holiday, only to return to active duty as a woman.

Thiago de Costa Teixeira, 33, served in an anti-drugs unit and is currently in charge of a division in the city of Goiana.

He took a three-month holiday at the end of last year in order to get a sex change in Thailand, and will return to work as Laura next month.

Sex change: Thiago de Costa Teixeira, left before surgery, had an operation to become a woman, right, and is now known as Laura

Her 'bravery' has been hailed by superiors in the police force, and LGBT campaigners have said that it is a first for a Brazilian worker not to be forced out of their job after having a sex change.

The police officer was previously married to a woman and has two young sons.

Along with the sex change operation Miss Teixeira also had facial reconstruction surgery to create a softer female jawline and nose.

Miss Teixeira, who has applied to have a gender and first name changed legally, said: 'I’ve always wanted to be a woman. But I was too ashamed to admit it. Eventually I couldn’t hide who I was.

'At first I was worried about how my police colleagues would react to the news but so far the reception has been great.

'Very macho': Colleagues spoke of her surprise at Miss Teixeira's decision in light of her previous professional persona

'I haven’t received a negative comment from any of the people I work with. In fact, everyone is treating me as if nothing has happened, she told Brazilian newspaper O Popular.

She has worked for the Goias state civil police force for over four years, first in the special narcotics division and then as the head of a division in Goiana.

Daniel Diniz Adorni, Deputy General Delegate of Goias civil police, said: 'We see Laura’s personal decision as an act of bravery,' said

'For us, her case is not an issue. We are more concerned about tackling the corruption, violence and negligent behaviour of some of our police officers,' said the senior officer.

'Laura has always been a valued and respected member of the corporation and this doesn’t change just because she has undergone surgery. She will continue to be employed in the same position that she held as Thiago.'

Luiz Mott, a Brazilian LGBT campaigner, said: 'This is a historical moment in the fight for equal rights for transgender employees.

New look: Miss Teixeira posted photographs on Facebook of her new appearance. She will return to work in February

'To my knowledge this is the first case of its kind in Brazil where a worker has had a sex change and has not been forced out of their job.

'Even more important is that Laura works for a public corporation and is being allowed to return to her duties without any opposition from her managers. This is something to be celebrated.'

Changes: Miss Teixeira also had surgery to alter the shape of her face, so that it would appear more feminine

On her Facebook page Miss Teixeira posted a picture of a phoenix - a symbol of rebirth in Classical mythology - rising from the ashes along with photographs of her as a woman, with long coiffured hair wearing make-up and a Civil Police black shirt.

However, some officers have warned that despite the public support she has received, Miss Teixeira could be in for a less pleasant reception from her colleagues.

One anonymous source described her as ‘very macho’ with 'all the characteristics of masculinity' you could 'hardly believe that he would turn into a woman.'

Another said: 'As far as I can remember he’s never shown any tendencies towards homosexuality or wanting to change his sex. I think he will have a difficult time settling back into the job dressed as a woman with a female name.'

Another who remembered her time as coordinator of the special narcotics investigative team, said: 'The chief was fearless in times of danger demonstrating his strength and courage as a man when facing killers and drug dealers. I remember he even had a beard at one stage.

'He exuded testosterone. He was not the sort of guy you would expect to become a female,' he added incredulously.

But according to officers who work closely with Miss Teixeira, the sex change hasn't come as a surprise.

Home turf: Miss Teixeira is an officer in the city of Goiana, in north-western Brazil

'A number of us knew he was gay, it was an open secret but not something widely discussed especially as he was such a tough cop and someone you didn’t mess with,' said one.

Carlos Gorski a senior police officer with the Goias force said: 'Unfortunately, we still have to live with the fact that some police officers will be shocked and make jokes when they meet Laura, but we preach tolerance and democracy.

'People have the impression that the profession is very masculine. We are trying to change attitudes internally so that police officer’s behaviour improves not only towards colleagues who are homosexual but most importantly towards the general public.'

Brazil suffers from a high level of homophobic violence and abuse. According to government statistics complaints of violence against gay people more than doubled between 2012 and 2013.

Miss Teixeira has already indicated that he plans to ask for a transfer from his old job running the police station in Goiana to the police unit that specialises in tackling crime against females.

'I feel that as a woman now I can make a difference investigating and helping transgender victims in particular who suffer abuse and violence because of who they choose to be,' she said.
