These eerie pictures show the demise of an abandoned Grade II listed home, once lovingly cared for by a local historian.

Situated in the leafy, affluent suburb of Moseley, Birmingham it was once a stunning example of a quintessentially English detached house.

It has now been repossessed after its current owners were declared bankrupt, after they left it to decay for at least eight years.

The front of the Grade II listed home, in Moseley, Birmingham, which has been left abandoned for eight years after its owners went bankrupt

The view from the back of the abandoned property shows the lawn growing out of control and trees and vines climbing up the side of the house

The gardens in the Birmingham property remain overgrown and don't appear to have been maintained at all during the eight years the home has been deserted

The loft inside the home was left almost completely bare. A local history group is growing 'increasingly concerned' about the state of the abandoned property

The fireplace inside the historic stately English home, which was first built in 1916 and once lovingly cared for by a local historian

Couches and mould-covered walls have been left to rot. The building has now been repossessed and remains unsecured after its owners left it about eight years ago

The house tells the story of the changes in English society that have been felt particularly in the West Midlands.

The exterior of the house still looks much the same as when it was completed for Albert Gosling, a butcher, in 1916. It maintains features such as the cupola on top of the garage, which allowed exhaust fumes to escape.

Inside, many of the original wooden panels and stained glass windows remain. The kitchen has a distinct 1970s kitsch feel, whilst the living room has a picture of Mecca hanging.

Fiona Adams, 67, Secretary of the Moseley History Society said: 'It was the home of Fred and Olive Price - the Moseley Local History Group had many meetings there.

'We’ve been increasingly concerned about the state of this charming Arts and Crafts house that Fred lovingly maintained.'

Despite the fact the property has been ignored for a number of years, parts of the interior and living room appear to remain in relatively good condition

However, other parts of the home are in need of major repairs. Here the floor of the living room can be seen with holes while a spider has made a room its nest

A court order stuck on the property's window states the home has been repossessed, however the property still remains unsecured

The home is abandoned but little appears to have been done to clean up, with used teacups and cutlery left lying throughout the kitchen

Both the kitchen and one of the sitting rooms need major repairs, with building materials and mould visibly staining the walls

A large Sony television, along with newspapers and photos of Diana remain intact. Much of the house's exterior also remains as it was when it was completed in 1916

Still in the house were used teacups, a large Sony television, photographs of Lady Diana, newspapers, made beds and family photographs showing Fred Price.

Javid Sattar, who was the last owner of the house, is believed to be the President of the World Council of Muslim Youth.

A business card stating Mr Sattar's job title and contact details was found in the home. There was also a photograph of Mecca, the Muslim holy site in Saudi Arabia, and a copy of a book issued during the Pakistan National Defence College's 2002 visit to the United Kingdom.

A letter from a law firm has been put up in the house notifying Mr Sattar that it is now in their possession. However, the building hasn’t been secured.

The house has slipped a long way from it’s former glory giving concern to neighbours who blame the decay for burglaries on their own properties, saying that it has enabled thieves to gain access through the abandoned house’s garden.

A copy of the Daily Mail from June 1, 2006, is left lying in the house - giving an indication of just how long the property has been left to decay

A large Sony television, with a thick gathering of dust on it, has been left in the living room. It was once the home of Fred and Olive Price, two local history enthusiasts

The home's dining area remains a mess, with clothes, rubbish, bowls and cutlery left scattered across the floor and dining table

These pictures show Fred Price, who once owned and cared for the historic property, prior to its latest owner abandoning it eight years ago

A photo of Mecca was left hanging on the living room wall inside the property. A business card found at the address states the former owner was the president of the World Council of Muslim Youth

A picture of Lady Diana remains the living room, while on the right is a book commemorating a Pakistan National Defence College visit to the United Kingdom. The former owner, Javid Sattar, is a property magnate who also owns numerous other properties in and around Moseley
