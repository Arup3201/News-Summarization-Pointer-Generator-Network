Yahoo's Scott Thompson, who was pressured to give up his CEO post because his official biography included a college degree he never received, will receive no severance package.

The struggling internet company disclosed in a regulatory filing today that it is not paying Thompson anything more.

Thompson, who reportedly has thyroid cancer and stepped down after allegedly telling Yahoo's board about his condition, will keep a $1.5 million bonus, as well as stock valued at $5.5 million.

He will receive restricted stock valued at $5.5 
million that Yahoo paid him when he joined the company to compensate him
for benefits he gave up leaving his job running PayPal, the online 
payment service owned by eBay Inc.

Yahoo required Thompson to surrender unvested stock awards valued at $16 million.

Thompson was getting an annual salary of $1 million at Yahoo and could have gotten a bonus of up to $2 million this year.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people
it did not identify, said that Thompson told Yahoo's board and several 
colleagues of his condition before resigning from his role with the 
company.

The newspaper said it was told by one source that Thompson's decision to resign was partly influenced by his cancer diagnosis.

54-year-old Thompson lives in Silicon Valley with his wife, two sons and a daughter.

He was hired as Yahoo's CEO in January to fill a void created by Carol Bartz's firing.

Yahoo Inc. has named Ross Levinsohn 
as its interim CEO. Levinsohn had a successful stint running Internet 
services within Rupert Murdoch's media empire at News Corp. before Bartz
hired him in November 2010.

Yahoo's stock gained 33 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $15.52 in premarket trading Monday.Yahoo Inc Chief 
Executive Scott Thompson is stepping down from his role at the Silicon 
Valley internet giant.

Yahoo has said that Thompson did not have a computer science degree, despite what was stated in his official company biography and in regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Levinsohn most recently also ran its Americas unit, including its advertising sales.

The move is a victory for hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb of Third Point LLC, which is Yahoo's largest outside shareholder and brought the discrepancy in Thompson's educational background to light.

It was Loeb and Daniel Levinsohn, head of Third Point, which owns 5.8 per cent of the company, who discovered Thompson's misstep and told the world of his phoney degree claim.

Loeb has been waging a bitter proxy battle to install a slate of four directors on the Internet company's board, which he has accused of being dismissive of investors' input and in need of restructuring capabilities and media strategies.

According to the AllThingsD blog, which reported Thompson's departure earlier on Sunday, Yahoo's board is closing in on a settlement with Loeb that will give Third Point three board seats.

The blog said Yahoo's recently added director Fred Amoroso will be named chairman of the board.

Yahoo was not immediately available for comment.

Emails sent to Thompson's official Yahoo email address were already bouncing back on Sunday morning.

Yahoo is in the midst of trying to 
revive revenue growth and its popularity with consumers, facing fierce 
competition from Google, Facebook and other online companies.
