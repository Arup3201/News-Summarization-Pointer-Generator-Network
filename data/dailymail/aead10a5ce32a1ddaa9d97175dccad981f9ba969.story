Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil admits there is room for improvement in 'all departments' as he aims to kick on in the Premier League in his second season.

The German midfielder joined the Gunners in a club record £42.5million deal from Real Madrid last summer and despite impressing statistically, struggled to adapt with the physical game at times.

But after his World Cup win in Brazil, Ozil says he is fully focused on contributing more, including in the goalscoring department.

'There is room for improvement in all departments,' he told Sport Bild, translated by ESPN.

'I need to have more shots at goal again, and also improve my headers. The World Cup title was a great success, but it has to go on now.'

Ozil has admitted he found his first season tough, but despite only arriving at the training ground after an extended break on Monday, says he has been impressed with the new recruits and hopes the club can withstand a title challenge.

The 25-year-old knows only too well how difficult it can be acclimatising coming from La Liga, which Alexis Sanchez will be looking to do this season.

When things don't run that smooth at times, there is criticism. Sometimes it's fair, and sometimes it's unfair. But I can judge my performances very well - and I also know how the coach [Arsene Wenger] and the fans rate it.'

'It's difficult in England,' he said. 'There at least five teams competing for the title in the Premier League. But to me personally it's clear: I want to have maximum success in every competition I play.
