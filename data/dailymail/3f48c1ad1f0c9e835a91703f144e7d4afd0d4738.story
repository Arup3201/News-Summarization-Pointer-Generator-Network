The torture of Al-Qaeda suspects by the CIA shows that the US government is a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity,' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said.

His was the first official reaction in Iran to a U.S. Senate report yesterday that torture of suspects in the years following the 9/11 attacks on America was far more brutal than acknowledged and failed to produce useful intelligence.

But his sentiments were echoed by leaders in China and North Korea who also condemned America's treatment of detainees.

Khamenei said: 'Today, US government is symbol of tyranny against humanity; even American people are faced with cruelty,' wrote on Twitter, referring to a speech he had made in 2007.

Tehran is regularly criticised from abroad over its own human rights record, especially regarding the high number of people it executes, and over restrictions on press and religious freedoms.

But it invariably retorts that these accusations are politically motivated, in turn criticising Western nations for trying to impose on the Islamic republic their concept of human rights. 

In a further tweet, from a 2010 speech, Khamenei said the U.S. 'claim human rights and trample its basics in their prisons'. He went on to say they even breached the rights of other nations and even those of their own people. 

Khamenei's tweets drew extensive comments.

China foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called on America to address its practices, saying: 'We believe that the U.S. side should reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions'; above a detainee is escorted to interrogation by U.S. military guards at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay

Some recalled the numerous cases of people who have died in detention in Iran in recent years, and the case of a woman hanged in October for stabbing to death a man she said had tried to sexually assault her.  

The Senate Intelligence Committee's five-year review of 6.3 million pages of CIA documents concluded that the agency failed to disrupt a single plot despite torturing al Qaeda and other captives in secret facilities between 2002 and 2006. George W. Bush was the president at that time.

Meanwhile, China urged the U.S. to 'correct its ways', while defending its own human rights practices were have been frequently questioned. 

China foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called on America to address its practices, saying: 'We believe that the U.S. side should reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions.'

She said China had 'consistently opposed' torture. The government has vowed to stamp out torture, following a series of cases of wrongful convictions which came about after confessions were extracted under torture.

China and the U.S often spar about each other's human rights records. China has even begun issuing its own annual report on the U.S. rights record, criticising it for issues ranging from racism to gun crime and homelessness.

North Korea, which has been criticised by the UN over its own human rights record, also took pot shots at the U.S. 

Pyongyang urged the Security Council to censcure the country over its 'inhuman torture' methods and said the revelations posed a major test for the council's credibility. 

Discussing North Korea's rights record while 'shutting its eyes' to rights violations by one of its permanent members, would confirm the council's 'miserable position' as a 'tool for US arbitrary practices,' a foreign ministry spokesman said.

As well as the 'inhuman torture practised by the CIA,' the spokesman cited the recent killings of black suspects by white police officers as another 'despicable' strike against America's human rights record.

He said: 'If (the Security Council) wants to discuss the human rights issue, it should ... call into question the human rights abuses rampant in the US.'

The Senate Intelligence Committee's five-year review of 6.3 million pages of CIA documents concluded that the agency failed to disrupt a single plot despite torturing al Qaeda and other captives in secret facilities between 2002 and 2006. George W. Bush was the president at that time 

The remarks, carried by the North's official KCNA news agency, are part of a concerted effort by North Korea to ward off further censure at the United Nations.

The Security Council is expected to meet this month on North Korea's rights record, following a proposal to refer Pyongyang to the International Criminal Court on possible charges of crimes against humanity.

The proposal was included in a landmark resolution adopted in a UN General Assembly committee last month.

Drafted by Japan and the European Union, the resolution drew heavily on the work of a UN inquiry which concluded in February that the North was committing rights abuses 'without parallel in the contemporary world'.

Pyongyang has rejected the inquiry and condemned the resolution, saying both were initiated and controlled by the U.S. in a politically motivated effort to humiliate the regime of leader Kim Jong-Un.

Although China and Russia would block any Security Council move to refer Pyongyang to the criminal court, North Korea was rattled by the adoption of the strongly-worded UN resolution and has threatened 'catastrophic consequences' for its supporters.

In his remarks on Wednesday, the foreign ministry spokesman said the inquiry's report was 'full of prejudice and lies' whipped up the U.S. to justify an eventual military invasion of North Korea.
