A two-year-old boy playing with his toy wheelbarrow was bowled over by a kangaroo which then pinned him down and tried to claw him to death.

The screaming child's terrified parents ran at the animal and managed to chase it away - but not before it left Zakkiah Galea with severe wounds to his face and body.

His mother Nicole Galea last night told how the aggressive kangaroo left her in fear that her son had received fatal injuries in the attack on the family's ten-acre property at Port Macquarie, in northern New South Wales.

In hospital: Two-year-old Zakkiah Galea was playing in his garden in New South Wales when he was attacked by a kangaroo which tried to claw him to death

Mrs Galea, who is eight-months 
pregnant, said: 'The kangaroo was on top of him. He was pinned to the 
ground while it clawed at his forearms.

'I screamed at the kangaroo to get off him but it wouldn't - it just kept on attacking.'

It
was only when Zakkiah's father, Andrew Galea, rushed to help his wife 
fight off the kangaroo that the animal finally ran off into nearby 
bushland.

'It turned on Andrew first before hopping away,' Mrs Galea told Sydney's Daily Telegraph.

'It was just awful to see Zakkiah. He had a bloody face and blood had soaked through his shirt.

'There was a deep puncture in his chest and a gash on the top of his leg. He had two large gouges from his mouth to his ear.'

Last night, Zakkiah was recovering at home from his wounds that required 13 stitches.

His mother said: 'He scared. He says he doesn't want to be attacked by the "tiger kangaroo" again.'

Other people in the remote neighbourhood have been attacked by kangaroos, said Mrs Galea, and she suspected urban development was to blame - new houses forcing the animals into human environment.

Peter Clark, of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, said people should be aware that kangaroos are wild animals of substantial size and power and might react instinctively and attack if they are startled.

He suggested that people living close to kangaroos should fence off their properties and remove food, shelter and water opportunities.

He also suggesting turning on water sprinklers to discourage the animals from gathering.
