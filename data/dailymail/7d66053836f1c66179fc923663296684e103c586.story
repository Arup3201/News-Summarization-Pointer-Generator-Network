Lenovo has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a 'horrifically dangerous' software named Superfish.

The Chinese computer manufacturer says Superfish helps users find products online by analysing images and presenting similar, cheaper products.

But security analysts claim that what Superfish actually does is serve intrusive ads, as well as compromise private information such as bank details and passwords.

The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015

The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015.

And users have been raising concerns about Superfish since September

The biggest concern is that Superfish makes people vulnerable to something known as a 'man in the middle' attack.

'The way the Superfish functionality appears to work means that they must be intercepting traffic in order to insert the ads,' said Eric Rand, a researcher at Brown Hat Security. 'This amounts to a wiretap.

The software allows hackers to impersonate the security certificates of encrypted websites, allowing them to potentially see and steal private data.

This is possible because the Superfish adware breaks HTTPS – or encrypted - connections to serve up product information. This inadvertently opens up a back door to hackers.

The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015.

Users can find out if they are affected by looking at Windows' list of trusted certificates by opening up the Control Panel and searching for 'certificates'.

If Superfish Inc is one of them, the computer may be vulnerable to attack.

Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system.

While the site visited appears secure, when its certificate is analysed it's shown to belong to Superfish, rather than the site visited. 

Anyone with the password that unlocks that certificate would be able to bypass the computer's web encryption.

This morning, researchers found and published the password, meaning the software can now be used as a channel for attack 

'This means that hackers at your local cafe Wi-Fi hotspot, or the NSA eavesdropping on the internet, can use that private-key to likewise intercept all SSL [encrypted] connections from Superfish users,' Robert Graham of Errata Security told Forbes.

He added this amounted to 'an egregious security failure…its intent is so that Superfish can 'hack' you, and it opens the system up to hacks by others.'

In a statement earlier today, Lenovo said the company had 'thoroughly investigated this technology and [does] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns'

Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system.

A Lenovo community administrator, Mark Hopkins, wrote in January that the software would be temporarily removed from current systems. 

Writing for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Joseph Bonneau says the software is 'horrifically dangerous'.

He added: 'Lenovo has not just injected ads in a wildly inappropriate manner, but engineered a massive security catastrophe for its users.'

In a statement earlier today, Lenovo said the company had 'thoroughly investigated this technology and [does] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.'

However, Superfish will no longer be pre-installed and has been disabled on all products in the market since January, when Lenovo also stopped pre-installing the software.

Lenovo has not yet responded to DailyMail.com for comment.

Concerns about cybersecurity have dogged Chinese firms, including telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd over ties to China's government and smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc over data privacy.

Lenovo commanded one-fifth of the global PC market in the third quarter of 2014, according to data research firm IDC.

It also allows hackers to impersonate certificates of encrypted sites
