A devoted husband who spent a year walking the streets with a sandwich board appealing for a kidney donor for his wife is a very happy man after his wife successfully underwent surgery on Wednesday.

Larry Swilling’s extraordinary appeal came to fruition earlier this month when 41-year-old retired Navy lieutenant commander Kelly Weaverling came forward and proved to be a perfect match.

She read online about Larry’s admirable efforts to find a kidney for his beloved wife of 57 years, Jimmie Sue, and said she was immediately stuck with an overwhelming feeling that she could help.

‘Have you ever just had a feeling that was just a strong gut feeling that you just went with your instinct, because you just knew it was right?’ she told CBS. ‘That's exactly what happened. I could do something to give this family hope.’

Earlier this week, Weaverling flew to Anderson, South Carolina, and met the Swillings. 

'I told her I was going to give her the biggest hug she’d ever had in her life,' Larry Swilling, 78, told The Virginian Pilot. 'And I did.'

On Wednesday, one of Kelly’s kidneys was successfully transplanted into Jimmie Sue at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Larry Swilling first made headlines last September when he started walking all over his hometown wearing the sign with the message 'NEED KIDNEY 4 WIFE'.

‘I had to do something. She looks after me, and I look after her,’ he told CBS.

Jimmie Sue, 76, had been born with only one kidney. It was failing her and the need for a replacement had become urgent as she had been having dialysis three times a week for the past year.

'I knew it was going to happen because I know Larry. He would not have stopped until he got me one,' said Mrs Swilling.

Her husband had initially hoped that he might to donate a kidney to his wife himself, but neither he nor any of their three children have the right blood type.

Since his appeal had started, the couple had been inundated with offers almost 2,000 in total, from as far away as Germany, Switzerland and Jamaica.

Jimmie Sue was one of more than 
96,000 people in the U.S. waiting for a life-saving kidney transplant, 
according to the National Kidney Foundation. According to statistics, donations from strangers are uncommon.

‘There's not enough words,’ said Larry Swilling, struggling to find a way to thank Weaverling.
