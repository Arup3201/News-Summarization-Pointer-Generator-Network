England delivered a comfortable 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain finished off a sublime Jack Wilshere pass while Wayne Rooney's scored a double to go past Jimmy Greaves' England tally. 

Andrew Robertson's second-half strike gave the Tartan Army hope but Rooney's second came almost immediately after it to maintain the visitors' two-goal buffer.

ENGLAND 

Fraser Forster - 7 

Didn't disappoint on his return to Celtic Park and on only his second England start. Strong and commanding.

Nathaniel Clyne - 7.5 

Didn't falter in a big atmosphere and contained the pace of Ikechi Anya, one of Scotland's big threats, with poise.

Nathaniel Clyne (left) performed well on the big stage and managed to contain the pacy Ikechi Anya

Gary Cahill - 6.5 

Rode out the first-half pressure well and held England together when Scotland had their early dominant spell.

Chris Smalling - 6 

Better, though the odd miskick and aberration still makes you worry. In general, though, did the job required of him.

Luke Shaw - 6.5 

Still raw defensively but when charging forward with the ball is an incredible threat. Needs to work on end product.

Chris Smalling did what was asked of him but remains a worry with the occasional miskick

James Milner - 7 

Solid, as expected, and occasional flashes. But found if difficult to control the game in those first half periods in which Scotland impressed. Good delivery for free kick that led to second goal.

Jack Wilshere - 7.5

His growing adeptness to his deeper midfield role demonstrated once again with his delightful through ball for Oxlade-Chamberlain's goal. Rapidly becoming England's best player.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7 

Always a threat and though he won't score many headers for England, he finished this one comfortably enough.

Wayne Rooney - 8 

Always abuzz, appeared to be relishing the animosity as he busied himself at centre forward. Good reaction for first goal and sound finish for the second.

Stewart Downing - 6 

Started brightly, combining well with Welbeck and Rooney but faded a little in the first half as Scotland's midfield grew.

Danny Welbeck - 6.5 

Had and energy and ideas, stretching the Scotland defence - but should have done better with his early chance.

Danny Welbeck shows his frustration after squandering a good chance in the first half

Kieran Gibbs (66) - 6

Filled in well for Shaw, demonstrating England's surfeit of left backs.

Phil Jagielka (HT) - 6.5

Defended well and always likely to rise to an occasion such as this.

Adam Lallana (HT) - 6.5

Great cut back for Rooney’s second goal capping a fine year for England.

Adam Lallana made an impact off the bench, providing the cut-back for the Rooney goal they're celebrating

Raheem Sterling (66) - 5

Terrible in his defensive role in allowing Scotland back in the game. Had little chance to show his attacking strength.

Rickie Lambert (80) - 6.5

Contributed to England’s third goal in the short time on pitch.

SCOTLAND 

David Marshall - 7 

Collected Welbeck's early shot well and looked confident and sharp throughout - could do little with goal. Substituted at half-time.

Steven Whittaker - 5.5 

Struggled against Welbeck and Rooney, who interchanged on the left wing. Couldn't impose himself. 

Andrew Robertson - 7 

Had done well enough but caught cold when ball bounced off him for Rooney's headed goal, but scored to give Scotland hope.

Russell Martin - 6.5 

The better of the two centre halves attempting to hold together a creaky Scottish defence - but he did so in vain. 

Grant Hanley - 5 

Scotland's solid start was ruined when he somehow allowed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to drift in front of him and head home. 

Scott Brown - 6.5

Lost the possession badly to present England with a first half counter attack - but they failed to capitalise. Otherwise did well in midfield.

Grant Hanley (right) keeps close tabs on Wayne Rooney but was left standing for Ox's subtle finish

Charlie Mulgrew - 7.5 

Scotland's best player early on when he established control of the midfield and drove his side on.

Shaun Maloney - 6.5 

His first half strike which flew over Forster's goal was a wasted opportunity which blighted an otherwise effective performance. 

Steven Naismith - 7 

Characteristically energetic performance causing England a few problems in the first half - but had little support to speak of. 

Steven Naismith lacked support from his team-mates in a characteristically energetic performance

Ikechi Anya -6

Got little change out of Nathaniel Clyne and so one of Scotland's most potent weapons was neutered. 

Chris Martin - 5.5

Worked hard holding the ball up and running channels but ultimately to little.

Substitutes

Craig Gordon (HT) - 6

Had barely taken the pitch before he was picking the ball from the net. After that did well enough.

Darren Fletcher (HT) - 6.5

Added some solidity to the midfield but the game had largely gone.

Steven May (66) - 6

Did his best to fill in but couldn’t prevent England’s third.

James Morrison (HT) - 6

Worked to get in game but Scotland could create little for him

Barry Bannan (66) - 6

Unable to impose himself on game though worked hard

Johnny Russell (80) - 7

Terrific run and cross for Scotland’s goal. Made a real impact 

Managers

Roy Hodgson, England - 7

Good end to a bad year which shows the team is with him.

Gordon Strachan - 6 

Didn’t do much wrong tactically but Scotland were not good enough.

Referee: Jonas Eriksson - 6 

Wasn’t the bloodbath people feared. Did well.
