Arsene Wenger revealed Tomas Rosicky may have a broken nose after the Arsenal midfielder was caught by Gabriel Agbonlahor during the Gunners' win over Aston Villa.

Rosicky, who came on as a second-half substitute for Serge Gnabry, was caught by a stray elbow from Agbonlahor as the pair went up for a header.

Wenger said Rosicky has 'a bad nose. We don't know if it's broken,' and added: 'Honestly I didn't see the elbow, I have to watch it again. He [Tomas Rosicky] told me that he got the elbow but he himself doesn't know if he did it on purpose. He doesn't know.'

Groggy: Rosicky was attended to by two of the Arsenal medical staff after the clash with the Villa man

Arsenal may have come away with all three points in the 2-1 win at Villa Park but Rosicky wasn't the only one feeling the strain of the Monday-night trip.

Nacho Monreal was on the receiving end of a seemingly fair challenge from Ron Vlaar that left the Spain full back with a potential broken metatarsal.

Wenger said: 'I think Monreal is an accident but we 
have to check his metatarsal tomorrow morning because he got kicked on 
the top of the laces.'

Another worry: Arsene Wenger also has concerns over the fitness of Nacho Monreal
