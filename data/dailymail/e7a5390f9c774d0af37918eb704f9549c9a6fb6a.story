The jet-setting Bacardi rum empire heiress Monika Barcardi has claimed that she was blackmailed by the playboy stepson of the founder of the Italian car design dynasty Abarth.

Europe is now braced for a trial promising to spin a real-life tale of glamour, wealth, stealth and sex.

Raphael Abarth, 57, was arrested after demanding a £234,000 'connection fee' for putting Monika in touch with the high society set she was later to marry into.

Police say she paid him close to £80,000 before she realised she was being 'shaken down'. She refused to hand over any more cash and called in detectives.

'I lived in fear for mine and my daughter's life,' she told police.

Italian-born Monika, now 54, who once helped to run her family's real estate business, married the Cuban-born billionaire Luis Adalberto Facundo Gomez del Campo Bacardi after she went to work for him. She allegedly got the job thanks to a recommendation from Raphael's mother, Anneliese, the third wife of Carlo Abarth who died in 1979.

He founded a famous Italian motorcycle firm and in 1933 won acclaim across the continent when he beat the Orient Express train in an 800-mile race from Vienna to Ostende in Belgium. He went on to become a top designer for Fiat and Porsche. 

According to Arbarth, Monika was hired after Anneliese made the introductions and she and Luis married in 2000. Her's was a world ever-after of private jets, presidential hotel suites, exotic villas, servants, jewels and all the glittering prizes money could buy.

Luis was a board member of the family rum business for 40 years, and passed away just five years after their marriage. 

They had one child together, Maria Luisa, who continues to live with her mother for most of the year in Monaco. Media reports have put the widow's wealth at between £500m and £600m.

It's understood she had little dealings with Raphael Abarth while Bacardi was alive, but she met him again later at a hunters' ball in the VIP ski resort of Kitzbuhel, a small medieval town in the state of Tyrol, western Austria.

She said: 'I wanted to help him because I knew him a long time ago and he always seemed to me to be like a nice man. He said he needed money for dental work.' 

In fact, Raphael was on his uppers by now, relying on eurotrash friends and acquaintances and seeking handouts from the ultra-rich he used to mingle with.

It is believed that he suffered a further setback on a failed supercar project called the Milan Arbath in 2012 and needed the support of people like Monika to help him sustain a little of the high life he loved so much. He claims that the money she gave him was part of a £234,000 fee that had been agreed with her for giving her access to high society.

But she told police that when he continued to demand cash for ever more extravagant reasons - such as visiting a miracle healer - she had refused, and he had then become 'aggressive and threatening.' The last demand for money came via his lawyer, Monika told police.

Abarth fell from grace, and the orbit of Europe's rich and beautiful set, in spectacular fashion a year ago when he was convicted in absentia for drug smuggling in Italy several years ago. 

In theory Abarth, who lives in the Austrian capital Vienna, should have been arrested in Austria and extradited back to Italy to serve his punishment for smuggling. The Italians want him to serve a 17 year jail term. 

Austrian prosecutors are also investigating how it is that he was apparently able to live openly despite the outstanding arrest warrant.

The Kurier newspaper in Austria quoted a police report which read: 'Surveys by the Federal Criminal Police Office and the Austrian liaison officers in Italy showed the accused to be clearly linked to organised crime'.

Austrian police claim to have found proof that he had threatened he would go to the press with lurid tales about her, a story which he said was to do with 'revelations about how she met her husband.' 

Abarth, who now reportedly lives off just £626 a month, allegedly told Bacardi that he also had 'mafia contacts.'

As a result of what they found Austrian police arrested him on August 20 and he is currently in custody and due to appear in the Vienna Regional Criminal Court on November 20. 

His lawyer Martin Mahrer said: 'My client was never acted with the intentions of a blackmailer.'
