Much maligned former Manchester City striker Jo is finally fulfilling his potential – six years after the £18million move which was marked him out as one of the world’s hottest prospects.

His eventual inevitable return back to Brazil looked to take the then-shaggy haired towering but clumsy frontman out of the spotlight, but now he could be leading the line for the five-time World Cup winners in his home country - complete with a new, more sensible haircut.

Arriving as Mark Hughes’ first signing as manager, Jo was an early sign for City fans that their new-found blank chequebook could not necessarily buy success.

Flop: Brazilian Jo signed for Manchester City in 2008 in an £18m deal but struggled to make an impact

Goal brought: Jo struck just 11 times at City and was shipped out on loan to Everton in his second season

Revival: Yet Jo will likely make an come off the bench for hosts Brazil in the World Cup opener against Croatia

The Brazilian centre-forward arrived from CSKA Moscow with the objective of being the star striker to lead a new blue era, but the reality was not so pretty.

He managed just 11 goals during his time at the Etihad – with five of those coming against small sides in the League Cup and Europa League.

A loan spell at Everton sandwiched between two seasons in sky blue was not hugely successful either, producing just two goals: against 10-man AEK Athens in the Europa League and soon-to-be relegated Hull City in the Carling Cup.

Second chance: Jo was sent out to Everton on loan from City but scored just twice for the Toffees

International: Jo has now played for Luis Felipe Scolari's Brazil side 15 times, scoring on five occasions

He even returned to South America without permission over the Christmas period in 2009, angering then boss David Moyes.

Jo bowed out from the Premier League as a big-money flop, quietly returning to Brazil and Internacional where he spent twelve months before joining current club Atletico Mineiro.

Even back in his home country the 6' 2" striker failed to initially shine – five goals in 36 games for Internacional didn’t exactly set the world alight and he even missed a flight for an away game after over-celebrating his birthday.

But he has impressed at Mineiro upfront alongside former Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldinho and was top scorer in his first season at the club as they won the South American equivalent of the Champions League, the Copa Libertadores.

Bad hair day: Gone is the long, curly hair which Jo sported in England now he is at Atletico Mineiro
