Seriously injured: Iosif Lole, 41, is being treated in hospital after being beaten unconscious by thugs in the street

A father-of-four has been left fighting for his life after being attacked by late night revellers he asked to keep the noise down and go home.

Iosif Lole, 41, was battered unconscious by the ‘pack of animals’ following a disturbance outside his house on Moston, Manchester, in the early hours.

Neighbours said knives and bricks were used in the attack, which was witnessed by his children from an upstairs window.

Iosif, who come to England from Romania three years ago, had hosted a party to celebrate moving into a new family home.

But trouble flared when he asked a gang of men to leave because he had to get up to work on his home in the morning.

A neighbour said that Iosif was knocked unconscious when his head hit the kerb, but that thugs continued to attack him as he lay on the ground.

Police arrested a 20-year-old at the scene on suspicion of assault. They later made a second arrest of a 19-year-old, also on suspicion of assault.

Iosif’s partner, Paraschiva Martin, was last night at his bedside in Salford Royal Hospital where he is being treated. She said doctors had told her they are ‘90 per cent sure he will have a disability’.

She
said: 'We had a party to celebrate us moving to a new house. Then some 
other guys came round with alcohol and Iosif said he had lots of work to
do on the new house the next day and wanted to go to bed so he asked 
everyone to leave.

'That’s when it all started. Someone slapped one of his friends and that started it all.

'Iosif
had gone upstairs as he wanted to check on the children. But then he 
went outside to make sure no one was fighting and to ask them to leave. 
He didn’t do anything wrong.

'He didn’t push anyone or say anything wrong. I opened the window, looked outside and could see everything.

Devastated: Iosif's partner Paraschiva Martin said their young children witnessed the attack from their bedroom window

'Someone threw at a stone at him - he didn’t see him and I shouted at him to take care.

'Then someone punched him and he fell and hit his head. I have never seen anything like this, ever.

'The
girls saw everything. Today one of them said to me ‘mummy, I saw daddy 
with blood on his face’ I told her that he was in good hands now.

The
couple, who have a 21 year-old son and three daughters aged 11, eight 
and two, moved to England from the Romanian city of Arad three years 
ago. She told how the attack was witnessed by their daughters - who 
looked on helplessly in horror.

'Seeing
him in the hospital was just horrible. The doctors have said they are 
90 per cent sure he will have a disability. What disability they do not 
know. I am very, very scared. I want to cry but I know I must stay 
strong for the girls.

'He didn’t deserve something like this. He is such a nice man. He would always help people.'

'People who had no benefits used to ask him for help and he would help them with their letters and give them money and food.

'Now I will just visit him in the hospital and pray he gets better. I just hope he is able to come home.'

Brutal attack: A gang of men set upon the father-of-four like 'a pack of animals' in this street in Moston, Manchester

A witness, who asked not to be named, described horrific scenes shortly before 1.45am on Tuesday.

She said: 'There was a lot of noise throughout the night but then it turned from shouting to threats.

'I
looked out and I saw a lad who lives on the street having what I could 
only call a Mexican stand-off with a group of Romanian lads.

'All of a sudden a load of lads from the nearby estate came to back up the lad who was on his own.

'Iosif
came out to calm the situation down and the kids from the estate set 
about him. They were like a pack of animals. It was dark but I think I 
saw knives and bricks. He cracked his head on the kerb as he went down 
but they would not stop. They were kicking him when he was on the floor.

'Pari came out and tried to drag him into the garden to protect him. They have young children who were looking out of the window. It’s awful. They are nice people who have lived there for a while.'

Chief Supt Russ Jackson said: 'We are 
conducting a thorough investigation into what is a very complex incident
involving multiple witnesses and offenders and are determined to 
unravel exactly what happened. It is vital that anyone who was at the 
party or who lives nearby and heard or saw something comes forward.'
