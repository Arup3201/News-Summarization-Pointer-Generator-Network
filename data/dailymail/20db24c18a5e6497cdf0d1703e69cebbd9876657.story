Three Arsenal players and one Chelsea man could all have seen red but their managers could not have complained after their own embarrassing spat.

Two senior managers with vast experience should not get involved in such antics. Wenger appeared to be the aggressor but there is seldom smoke without fire with Mourinho. A warning was correct for both.

The incident which sparked the confrontation was a poor Cahill challenge on Alexis Sanchez; at full speed a yellow will have appeared correct to Martin Atkinson, replays show that red would have been appropriate.

Calum Chambers should have had a second yellow card for a blatant body check on Andre Schurrle. 

Laurent Koscielny could have gone for giving the penalty away, while Danny Welbeck’s lunge at Cesc Fabregas  was very dangerous.

Meanwhile, seeing Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois trying to carry on despite what appeared to be concussion showed football must act before a player is seriously injured. 

Rugby has stopped players continuing to play when concussed — now football must do the same.
