It is no wonder Jos Buttler admits he is surprised at how quickly his Test call-up has come, given it is less than two months since captain Alastair Cook said the wicketkeeper wasn’t ready for the step up.

Cook’s verdict came after Buttler’s record-breaking century during the fourth One-Day International against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in late May.

Buttler had hit 121 off 74 balls as England came agonisingly close to chasing down 301.

VIDEO Buttler deserves his chance  

Jos Buttler, 23, has been talked about as the new Adam Gilchrist and he does have an incredible one-day record but his four-dayrecord — with Somerset and new countyLancashire — is less impressive

One-dayers: In 94 one-day games for club andcountry, Buttler has hit three centuries with asuperb average of 49.12 and a sensational strike rate of 124.25

Twenty20: In his T20 career, he has arespectable average of 26.24 after 119 games,with an astonishing strike rate of 143.63. He has smashed 10 fifties

First-class: In 56 four-day games, he hasmanaged just four centuries at an average ofIT IS no wonder Jos Buttler 33.32, with his strike rate plummeting to 59.17

His hundred, the fastest by an England batsman in 50-over cricket, sparked comparisons with Australia’s great wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.

The 23-year-old’s century came off just 61 balls, beating the record of 69 set by Kevin Pietersen in 2004. Buttler will now be expected to provide some of the X-factor which has been missing from England’s batting since Pietersen was sacked in February.

A move from Somerset to Lancashire last winter has paved the way for the keeper’s elevation. It is no surprise Peter Moores has called on Buttler now, given it was his decision to bring him to Old Trafford before swapping being coach of Lancashire for the England job.

‘It is a dream come true,’ said Buttler on Tuesday. ‘It’s probably come sooner than I imagined. I still feel I’ve got improvements to make, but it’s great I’ve been named in the squad. I can’t wait to get started.

‘It was a really tough decision to leave Somerset, but with my long-term goal being Test cricket, I knew I had to leave.

'I guess it’s justified it and it’s justified it pretty quickly. I didn’t expect to be playing Test cricket this quickly, but in sport opportunities come in different ways and at different times and I’m delighted.’

Scrutiny: The duo of Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have really struggled so far this summer

Impact: Buttler's performances in limited overs internationals have been incredibly impressive

Buttler needs only to look at Matt Prior, the man he replaces in the team, for a warning that his keeping will now be under the microscope.

Prior’s unreliability with the gloves saw him dropped early in his England career.

It is one of the reasons he has departed now, with his body unable to withstand the rigours of keeping at the highest  level.

By all accounts, Buttler’s glovework, which was shaky at the World T20 in Bangladesh in March, has improved at Lancashire this summer.

It is with the bat, though, that he excites. As well as the record set at Lord’s earlier this summer, he is averaging above 40 in  first-class cricket for his county this season — the stand-out innings an unbeaten 100 at Durham last month.

Time will tell if the comparisons with Gilchrist are simply hype, but the Australian is backing Buttler to be a success.

‘He’s obviously an effective, creative player who is developing shots and innovative,’ said Gilchrist.

‘I’m humbled that incredible judges around the game have compared him to me.

‘He’s a real talent.’
