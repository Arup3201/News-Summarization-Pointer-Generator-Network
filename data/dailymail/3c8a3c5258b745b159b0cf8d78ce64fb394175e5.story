It's been more than two years since Facebook bought Instagram, but we are now finally starting to see the influence the photo sharing app is having on the social network. 

In an update being rolled out to Facebook's iOS app, the Californian firm will now automatically edit and enhance photos before they're uploaded to the site. 

Any enhancement can still be edited, and filters and crops are still available, but Facebook will now suggest how the photo should look.

The tool, which until now has been optional feature, is being rolled out iOS users first, followed by Android owners. 

To see the feature, click Photo and select an image from the phone or tablet's camera roll. 

The photo will appear in a post window, and a small wand icon in the left-hand corner will be illuminated. This suggests an edit has been made. 

Pressing the wand icon removes the automatic enhancement, and shows what the image looked like before. 

Facebook is said to be working on software that could stop users posting embarrassing photos when drunk, for example. 

Yann LeCunn, the head of Facebook's artigicial intelligence lab, said the Digital Assistant would use image recognition and machine learning. 

It would be would be able to distinguish between drunk and sober pictures before asking the user if they're sure they want to upload. 

To edit the enhancement, press the wand again and move the slider up and down to make manual changes. 

Pressing the crop icon in the right-hand corner lets users change the aspect of the shot, and pressing the  image opens it in Facebook editor.

This is where filters can be added.

The changes were first spotted by TechCrunch.  

The changes come after Facebook-owned Instagram launched five new filters for its own app yesterday - the first time it's updated the range since December 2012. 

The new filters are called Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Perpetua and Aden, and take the total number of options up to 25.

'Since Instagram launched four years ago, our phone cameras have vastly improved,' explained the Facebook-owned firm.

'The original Instagram filters compensated for lower image quality, giving you more control over the look and feel of a photo.

'These new filters are more subtle - taking advantage of higher image quality, while still giving you a simple way to capture the mood, tone and feelings of the moment.'

Along with the five new filters, Instagram has also announced three new tools. 

From today, users can now upload slow-motion video, see comments appear in real time - without having to refresh the feed - and adjust the photo's perspective using the Adjust tool.

'Filters have been synonymous with Instagram from day one,' continued Instagram. 

'They were the original tool offered to help people capture and share photos that looked and felt as beautiful as they did in real life.' 

Instagram has also revealed the most popular filters, by country.

Amaro is the most commonly used filter in the UK, Germany, France, Russia, Japan and Australia. It was only beaten by Valencia in Korea.
