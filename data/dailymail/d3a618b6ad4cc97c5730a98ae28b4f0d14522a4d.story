A Conservative MP has been forced to apologise after he said he would punch a female journalist in the throat and suggested she should be deported.

Michael Fabricant, the former Tory vice chairman, wrote on Twitter that he could never have a debate with commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown as he would violently lose his temper.

He tweeted: ‘I could never appear on a discussion prog with @y-alibhai I would either end up with a brain haemorrhage or by punching her in the throat.’

Former vice-chair of the Conservative Party Michael Fabricant was sacked after outspoken criticism of the HS2 rail scheme and the Maria Miller expenses row

The comment instantly sparked 
widespread anger and he was given a stern warning by party whips who 
ordered him to make a full apology. But the flamboyant backbencher 
appeared to enjoy the attention, telling  news crews who turned up at 
his home after the incident that he ‘felt like a star’.

Mrs Alibhai-Brown, who writes for the Daily Mail, said the MP could ‘stuff’ his apology, which was ‘actually making it worse’.

She called for him to be kicked out of the Conservative Party if he failed to issue a ‘proper’ statement of remorse.

‘I think they should withdraw the 
whip or get him to issue a proper statement,’ she said, adding: ‘I don’t
 know if you have seen these tweets but if a child did this we would 
never accept these apologies. He’s not a child. Why is he doing this?’

Mrs Alibhai-Brown, a Muslim who came 
to Britain from Uganda in 1972, added that she felt like Mr Fabricant 
was ‘encouraging’ people who have previously threatened violence against
 her. She said:

‘These guys find us unbearable. I 
think they still think Asian women should be their ayahs, their 
nursemaids, or selling takeaways.’

Mr Fabricant wrote the controversial 
message after watching Mrs Alibhai-Brown clash with journalist Rod 
Liddle on Channel 4 News.

During a discussion about Islam and 
how immigration has changed Britain, Mrs Alibhai-Brown told Mr Liddle: 
‘I have no words to express how much I loathe you and I feel quite proud
 that I am able to tell you that.’

Outspoken journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown claimed Tory MPs like Mr Farbicant wanted Asians like her to 'serve curry'

After Mr Fabricant published his 
message, he went on to re-tweet a post written by another user which 
read: ‘She disgusts me. Should be deported.’

Mr Fabricant then attempted
 to make amends, explaining in a series of tweets that Mrs Alibhai-Brown
 was ‘utterly infuriating’ but he would not have actually punched her.

He wrote: ‘So just for the avoidance 
of any doubt, I am very sorry for the tweet. It was wrong to joke about 
punching and I completely withdraw it and apologise.’

David Cameron yesterday condemned the tweets as ‘completely unacceptable’ but ruled out withdrawing the whip from the MP.

MP Gloria De Piero, Labour’s women 
and equalities spokesman, said the comments were ‘utterly appalling’ and
 it was ‘unacceptable that views like this persist in the Conservative 
Party’.

But Andrew Allison, from the Freedom 
Association, said: ‘Everyone knows, or at least should know, that it was
 a figure of speech. Michael Fabricant finds her frustrating and doesn’t
 particularly like her views. He’s not advocating thumping her.’

Mr Fabricant, who is a former whip, 
was sacked as a party vice chairman in April after he tweeted ‘about 
time’ when Maria Miller stepped down as Culture Secretary following her 
expenses row.

She seemed to enjoy getting her own 
back yesterday, tweeting a picture with the text: ‘Think B4 U Type.’ Mr 
Fabricant has built up a loyal following on Twitter, where he has become
 known for courting controversy.

When it emerged that Flight MH370 had
 gone missing, he tweeted: ‘All our good news on the economy is 
currently as submerged and lost as the Malaysian Airlines flight 
recorder.’

He also reportedly landed in hot water with the Tory hierarchy after joking about having a relationship with a llama.

Since his sacking as party vice 
chairman, Mr Fabricant has refused to tone down his Twitter account, 
posting: ‘Look, I am still a Conservative MP and my personality and 
Twitter fingers are undiminished! I ain’t dead!’
