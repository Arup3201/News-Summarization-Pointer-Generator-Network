ESPN sports anchor Stuart Scott revealed that he is battling cancer again in a series of emotional online messages.

Only hours after informing followers on Twitter about his diagnosis, Mr Scott went on to host an episode of Sportscenter.

He earlier wrote that 'C reared its head again', a reference to his previous battle with cancer.

The presenter said that he was 'back in the fight' and told fans that he was 'blessed by prayers'.

Mr Scott informed his followers that he would be undergoing chemotherapy every two weeks, but defiantly added: 'I'll still work, still workout.'

The presenter first faced the illness in 2007 when a malignancy had to be treated with chemotherapy.

Scott revealed his determination, saying that he would fight with 'all C survivors & loved ones'.

He added: 'Cancer wants to re-appear..picked the right guy cuz I HIT HARD all day long!!'

The anchor retweeted messages of support from fans, including high-profile figures from the world of sport, such as Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson

After his late night broadcast he wrote: 'Just walked off the set of Sportscenter. OVERWHELMED at the twitter prayers & well wishes. THANK YOU..everyone. You ALL inspire me!!'

An ESPN spokesman said that Mr Scott 'plans to continue to work the best he can around his treatments'.

Asked how he felt about Armstrong, the presenter wrote: 'I'm 1 of millions of C survivors he's helped. #grateful.'

He also referred to Armstrong's charity Livestrong in several of his messages.

During
his 2008 treatment, Mr Scott said: 'I'm not the type of guy to let this
eat up my life. I've got strong faith and family and friends who are 
tackling this with me.'

The TV star also announced that he was 
receiving chemotherapy treatment on Twitter in 2011, after doctors 
discovered more cancerous tissue.
