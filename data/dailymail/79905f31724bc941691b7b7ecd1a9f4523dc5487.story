Authorities are searching for a teenage beauty queen from Nebraska who vanished on Sunday, after taking out the trash.

Michaela Wells, 16, had spent the day shopping with her mother for the gown she was going to wear in the upcoming USA National Pageant in Florida.

She took out the trash at her eastern Nebraska home, but never came back inside.

vanished: The family of a Nebraska teenage beauty queen are looking for help in finding their daughter. Michaela Wells, 16, took the trash out on Sunday and never came back inside.

No sign: Bellevue police confirm Michaela was reported missing on March 3. Officers said she has been entered into the database as a missing juvenile, they don't believe Michaela is in any danger

Her mother, Theresa Norris, said that her daughter was in a good mood because she had been asked out on a date.

She was also planning to attend a high school 'military ball' for students.

Miss Wells told her grandmother that she was going to take out the trash of her home in Bellevue - a task that takes less than ten minutes.

When the girl didn't come back inside, the family began to panic.

Description: Michaela was last seen wearing blue jeans, black slip on pumps, black tank top with teal over-shirt and a long red coat. She's 5 foot 6.5" tall and weighs 120 pounds

Disappeared: Michaela was last seen at her Grandmother's home. Michaela took the trash out around 8:30 p.m. and didn't return

Her father drove through the neighborhood whilst her mother called friends.

What concerns them the most is that their daughter wasn't dresses for the weather and even left her cell phone inside the house.

'Our daughter is missing. She vanished while taking out the trash at 8:37pm on Sunday, March 2, 2014.

She has now been missing for 39 hours. She is not dressed for the weather and her cell is still here at home.

Theories: Her parents first thought Wells had seen a friend outside and hitched a ride to IHOP. But she didn't return home that night or the next

Police: At this time there is no evidence to indicate Michaela left her residence against her own will or that foul play is involved

Her friends are in shock as some of them had just talked to her the afternoon before she vanished to make plans for the week. Please share and help us find her!' Mrs Norris said in a Facebook post.

Miss Wells, the 2013 winner of the USA National Miss Nebraska Teen competition, was last seen wearing jeans, black slip on pumps and a teal hoodie, her mother said.

The family made the appeal on Facebook after informing the Bellevue police the girl had been missing, however police do not believe the girl is in danger and is likely with someone she knows.

Under dressed: Wells told her family she was stepping outside to take out the trash. She was wearing jeans, a dress coat and slip-on black pumps. She left her heavy winter coat and cellphone inside the house
