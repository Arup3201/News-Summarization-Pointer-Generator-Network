A large cup of Starbucks coffee contains more than three quarters of a person's 'safe' daily dose of caffeine, according to a report.

The 16oz 'Grande' coffee is said to contain nearly double the recommended limit for a pregnant woman, while a typical home-made 8oz cup of coffee is well above a 10-year-old's daily allowance.

But scientists stress that such statistical averages can vary widely from person to person, with factors such as gender and genetics having an impact on tolerance levels.

A person's tolerance can also be affected by other drug use, with women who take the contraceptive pill breaking down caffeine slower, and smokers process the stimulant faster than non-smokers.

A study by the government regulatory agency Health Canada concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect, such as anxiety or heart problems.

Too much caffeine? A Starbucks 'Grande' coffee

The average allowance for a pregnant woman is 200mg, according to the Food Standards Agency, and 75mg for a 10-year-old.

A 16oz Starbucks coffee has 330mg of caffeine, according to a table compiled by Chemical and Engineering News.

However, Starbucks deny the findings, saying their Grande contains just 140mg - still more than a third of the daily recommended limit.

This is compared to an 8oz cup of brewed coffee, which contains 133mg, and an 8oz cup of instant coffee, which has 93mg.

An 8oz can of Monster Energy has 92mg, while an 8oz Red Bull can has 83mg. A bottle of Coca-Cola contains 58mg of caffeine, while a an 8oz cup of decaf coffee has 5mg and hot chocolate has 9mg.

University of Florida's director of 
forensic toxicology, Bruce A. Goldberger, told Chemical and Engineering 
News: 'People often don’t understand the potential risk of these 
beverages.

'Caffeine is a stimulant and, when consumed at high enough levels, can have negative effects.'

A fatal dose of caffeine is thought to 
be around 10g - equivalent to around 75 8oz cups of coffee or 120 cans 
of red bull consumed within a few hours.

A report released in the U.S. last month
 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration 
showed the annual number of emergency room visits associated with energy
 drinks jumped 36 per cent to 20,000 in 2011 compared to the previous 
year.

The U.S. Food and 
Drug administration also announced last year that it is investigating 
reports of five deaths being linked to Monster Energy drinks. The 
company has denied any link.

The
 family of U.S. teenager Anais Fournier, who died in 2011 from a heart 
attack brought on by 'caffeine toxicity' after drinking two 24-ounce 
Monster cans within 24 hours are suing the company.

The caffeinated drinks market was estimated to be worth around £6.3 billion last year globally.
