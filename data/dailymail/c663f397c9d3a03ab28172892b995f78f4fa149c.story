It is a 110-year-old quintessential part of the traditional English social calendar.

But the BBC’s famous Last Night of the Proms is being brought well into the 21st century.

For the first time in its history the event will be broadcast in 3D to viewers at home.

Extravaganza: Paul McCreesh conducts the Gabrieli Consort & Players and five choirs in Mendelssohn's Elijah at the BBC Proms last year. This year it will be 3D

But, audiences will need a 3D-ready television and access to the corporation’s HD channels to access shows in this way.

On September 8 2012, the corporation will air its annual finale to the Proms season at the Royal Albert Hall.

Eight specialist cameras will give audiences at home the best seats in the house and provide an immersive experience.

A spokesman said: ‘Audiences will feel that they are actually in the orchestra, with a 3D view of every individual instrument.’

Last
year's BBC1 series Planet Dinosaur is also to be screened in 3D for the
first time in August after teams of specialists hand crafted the 
footage for the new format.

This
programme charts the rise and fall of the ‘ultimate killers’ such as 
the Spinosaurus, the largest predator ever to walk the Earth and the 
feather-winged Microraptor,

The BBC has already announced the Wimbledon ladies' and men's singles finals will be shown in 3D this weekend.

And
selected Olympics events - including the opening and closing ceremonies
and the Men's 100m final - will also be screened in the format.

Kim
Shillinglaw, head of BBC 3D, said: ‘Bringing Planet Dinosaur and The 
Last Night of the Proms to audiences enable us to test the technology 
across various genres and establish where 3D really enhances the 
viewers' experience.’

Viewers will need to have a 3D TV set and access to the BBC HD channel.

There are still question marks over whether 3D television will really take off, with some industry figures insisting that until a “glasses-free, affordable” option is available it is unlikey to.

Some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves from legal claims warning that viewing 3D TV may cause ‘motion sickness’, ‘disorientation’ and ‘eye strain’.

Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned 3D television would not take off in Britain.

The veteran, whose documentary for Sky - Flying Monsters - was made in the format, insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘too isolating’.

Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as World Cup football matches, the forthcoming Royal Wedding, or ground-breaking new nature or history shows.

In cinema, it seems Britain’s 3D boom may be over before it really even began.

Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format,  opted to stick with traditional 2D showings instead.

Little over a fifth of box office sales were for 3D films in 2011, compared to 27.5 per cent in 2010, according to figures from global industry analysts Rentrak EDI.

It had been expected the 3D trend would soar after the success of James Cameron’s epic Avatar, which made £615 million worldwide, with 90 per cent of the audience watching in the format.
