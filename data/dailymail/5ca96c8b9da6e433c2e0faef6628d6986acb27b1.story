This is the smiling face of Zina Haughton, pictured for the first time since she was gunned down by her estranged husband on Sunday.

Ms Haughton was among three women killed by 45-year-old Radcliffe Haughton during his terrifying shooting spree at a day spa in Brookfield, Wisconsin.

Haughton opened fire days after his wife was granted a restraining order preventing him from going near her, having taken to Facebook to appeal for help in escaping the state.

Four other victims, all female, were shot before Haughton turned the gun on himself. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

Tragic: Zina Haughton was among those shot dead by her estranged husband on Sunday at the spa where she worked

34-year-old Cary L. Robuck of Racine and 38-year-old Maelyn M. Lind of Oconomowoc have been named as the other fatalities.

Ms Robuck, a nail technician at the 
spa, and mother-of-two had intended to spend Sunday with her 
Grandfather, but was called into work at the last minute.

As news spread of the shooting her family and friends faced an agonising wait to find out whether she had been caught up in the tragedy.

Learning the awful truth, they posted messages on her Facebook wall, paying tribute to a 'truly 
wonderful and kind person'.

Cary Robuck is among the victims from the Brookfield spa shooting Sunday

'Cary was gentle, sweet and 
soft-spoken,' a colleague told the Mount Pleasant Patch. 'She was very 
popular with her clients. They really loved her.'

Haughton was targeting his estranged wife when he arrived at the spa at around 11am, police said.

Court 
records show that a judge issued a order of protection against Haughton 
just three days ago on October 18, hinting that there was a credible 
threat against her. 

Under that order, Haughton was prohibited from owning a firearm.

It was filed after an October 4 incident at the salon, 
where Mrs Haughton worked as a hair stylist, when the enraged 45-year-old slashed his wife's tires in the parking lot.

Suicidal: Haughton shot himself dead after going on his terrifying shooting spree

Haughton's two daughters - one of 
which was believed to have been at the salon at the time of the shooting
- were found by police and are safe, according to Brown Deer police 
chief Steven Rinzel.

Chief
Rinzel said that his department was familiar with Haughton - most 
recently on a domestic violence investigation at the home, which 
resulted in Haughton's arrest.

On his Facebook page Haughton wrote about a pressing need to leave his home in Wisconsin.

'Need to get out of Wisconsin. HELP...' he posted on October 8. The next day he followed it up with: 'Can anyone help me get out of Wisconsin?'

The Journal Sentinel contacted his father, Radcliffe Haughton Sr., who lives in Florida.

He
said the he spoke to his son by phone last week shortly after his 
estranged wife had been awarded the restraining order against him.

'I told him, whatever you do, don't do anything stupid,' Mr Haughton Sr. said.

'He told me, "I have to get out of Wisconsin."

'I am so saddened. I don't know what to tell you. As his father, I am very, very sorry and I did not expect this from my son.

'So he hasn't been apprehended? Oh Lord. Have mercy, God.

A witness saw a woman screaming, and running out of the spa towards traffic.

'She ran right out into the street (and) was pounding on cars,' David Gosh told The Journal Sentinel.

He then saw a man carrying a handgun run after her, and he was thought to be chasing after the woman.

The gunman then saw police beginning to gather and he ran back in the direction in which he came, and back into the spa.

'He was the shooter. He was looking for an escape route,' Mr Gosh said.

A restraining order granted in the days before the shooting prevented Radcliffe Haughton from going near his estranged wife

A witness told the Journal-Sentinel that a he saw a young girl running through a parking lot in a panic after her mother was reportedly shot.

'She was screaming, yelling, crying hysterical. She was pleading for help,' Christopher Pfeiffer told the local paper.

'She
kept saying, "My mother was shot." And she mentioned that there was a 
gunman. She ran into the bookstore and I followed her. But I watched her
from afar.'

Live video of the Azana spa shows a tactical team moving in around 2pm on Sunday.

According to the spa's website, it boasts that it is the largest salon and day spa in Brookfield with 9,000-square-feet.

The
layout of the spa- which has ten treatment rooms, male and female 
locker rooms, and a cafe area-complicates issues for police as people 
may be hiding inside.

The owner of the salon was out of the country at the time of the shooting and is reportedly headed back now.

Speaking at a news conference after the shooting, Brookfield Police Chief Daniel 
Tushaus said: 'It appears that he is 
deceased of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.'He added: 'There is no other suspect that we are seeking.'

During the investigation, cops encountered smoke from a small fire that had been started in the building, prompting them to issue a call for extreme caution and keeping them out.

Haughton was described as a bald ethnic man with darker skin, 
about 6 foot one inch tall and 270 pounds. He is believed to have taken a taxi to the spa.

This
is the second mass shooting in the state in the past two months. An 
Army veteran opened fire at a Sikh temple in August, killing six people 
and injuring three others.

Local news reporters drew comparisons to
an earlier incident in 2005, when a shooting took place at the nearby 
Sheraton hotel during a mass service.

In that  shooting, seven people 
were killed before the shooter turned the gun on himself.
