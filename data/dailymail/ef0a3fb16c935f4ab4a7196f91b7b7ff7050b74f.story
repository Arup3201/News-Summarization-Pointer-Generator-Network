A school is using a minibus to shuttle its 460 pupils a few hundred feet to their canteen each day - to save them crossing a busy road.

Staff at Langley Hall Primary Academy repeat the 90-second journey from their main campus to the dining hall in a converted pub.

Teachers claim the lights on a nearby pelican crossing in Slough, Berkshire, do not stay red for long enough for an entire class to cross.

They would like the local council to install a zebra crossing at an estimated cost of £40,000 or provide a lollipop person.

But in the meantime, the school says using the minibus is the 'safest and quickest' way to move pupils between the two sites.

The Harrow pub was refurbished by the school earlier this year so their existing hall could be freed up for lunchtime activities.

It has since been renamed Harrow Hall.

Dr Patricia Sutlieff, chairman of trustees and governors, said: 'Our priority is safety.

'This is the safest and quickest way of getting them to Harrow Hall, and it is working very well at the moment.'

Dr Sutlieff said some of the children had timed the journey and it takes 'about a minute to a minute-and-a-half'.

Slough Borough Council suggested a longer alternative walking route but the school was concerned about the time and safety.

The council is also undertaking a number of experimental traffic measures on the roundabout outside.

Dr Sutlieff added: 'We are making it work the best we can. A lot depends on the council’s final decision about the roads near us.

'The situation will be kept under review. However, we could continue the current system indefinitely.'

A council spokeswoman said it is doing its best to ensure safety in the area.

But it does not believe a zebra crossing would be a safe option because of its close proximity to a roundabout.
