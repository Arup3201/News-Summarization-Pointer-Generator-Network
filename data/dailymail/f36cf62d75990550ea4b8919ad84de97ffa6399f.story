An ingenious photographer uses a hidden camera disguised as a fake swan to take his wildlife snaps.

Henryk Janowski, 41, manages to get just inches away from birds by using a crafty floating canopy crafted to look like a swan that he made himself.

Henryk manages to take intimate pictures by spending hours sitting in the middle of lakes in his hideout.

Ingenious: Photographer Henryk Janowski hiding in the water under a floating canopy shaped like a swan

Cunning: Henryk manages to get inches away from wildlife in the water with his elaborate disguise

Subtle: Henryk says that 'nothing can compare to the views' in his disguise

It means that he can get close to the birdlife and capture them at their most natural.

Henryk, from Bielawa, Poland, explained that he came up with the idea because he was frustrated at disturbing the birds whenever he tried to get close.

He said: 'In my neighbourhood I have a beautiful swamp which attracts all kinds of birds - but it's not very accessible.

'I wanted to be able to photograph the birds without disturbing them.

I had to work out a way to capture the images without being an intruder.'

Stunning results: Henryk managed to take this close up while inside his swan hiding place

Take off: Henryk is surrounded by wildlife totally uninhibited by human presence

After he built the disguise himself, he also bought a diving suit so that he could sit in the cold water for hours.

Now he is able to immerse himself in the water almost up to his head.

He said 'I went out in the lake to test my idea and go out into the lake.

'It was extremely hard to get to the target area.

Under thick layer of water there was a mixture of mud and decaying vegetation. Crossing a few meters took an eternity.'

Crafty: Henryk managed to get right up close to the Kingfisher without scaring it away

Eye to eye: This beaver had no idea he was being photographed as he swam right by

In flight: Ducks landing at eye level with the hidden camera

Beak to beak: A detailed picture of a duck taken at a lake near Henryk's home in Poland

Hiding in his cunning contraption for the first time he realised that it was an immediate success.

He said: 'Suddenly, all around me I was surrounded by ducks, geese, cranes and swans.'

'Nothing could compare to the view I had before me, and the satisfaction of time and effort I put into the implementation of this new way of shooting.

'Whenever I swim in my camouflage, I feel at one with nature.

You pass birds and beavers at play, undisturbed by human presence.'

Splashing about: The veteran photographer captured a bird after it had just landed in the middle of the lake

Eerie: Henryk stayed in the cold water until late in the evening to get this atmospheric shot
