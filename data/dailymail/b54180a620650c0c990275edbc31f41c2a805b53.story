A surfboard rests on the white sand of Surf Beach, Santa Barbara, a foot-wide puncture mark bitten deep into its tough fibreglass shell, showing the size and sheer ferocity of the shark that killed its owner.

The photograph, released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department, shows the board that was being ridden by 39-year-old surfer Francisco Javier Solorio Jr., when he was attacked by a Great White shark in front of his friend.

An expert has determined that Mr Solorio was killed by a 15- to 16-foot Great White shark which bit in to his upper torso in the 
waters off Surf Beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara 
County.

Mr Solorio died at the scene despite his friend's desperate efforts to save him.

On Tuesday night, the victim has been identified as Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, 39, of Orcutt.

Victim: Officials say Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, 39, was killed after being bitten by a shark on his torso

Solorio's
 friend who was surfing with him witnessed the shark bite or hit the 
man, said sheriff's Sgt. Mark A. Williams.

The friend ended up swimming 
over and pulling him from the water onto the beach, where he received 
first aid.

The friend 
started first aid while another surfer called for help.

Paramedics who 
arrived on the beach took over the CPR, but the 39-year-old man was 
pronounced dead at the scene.

Officials said a shark bit Solorio in his upper torso.

The Air Force said that the victim was not affiliated with the base, which allows public access to some of its beaches.

The type of shark involved and other 
details were under investigation.

In a phone interview with the Daily 
Mail Tuesday evening, Williams said that an expert will be coming in to examine 
the shark bite in order to determine the exact species.

Williams said the man's identity will be released after his next of kin are notified.

Killer: Officials suspect a Great White shark may be responsible the deadly attack

The shark attack comes nearly exactly two years to the day after the latest fatality at Surf Beach, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

On October 22, 2010, Lucas Ransom, a 19-year-old student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, died when a shark measuring at 20 feet nearly severed his leg as he body-boarded.

Hundreds of miles south near the coast of San Diego, a 15-foot great white shark is believed to have killed triathlete David Martin, 66, in 2008, as he swam with a group of friends.

Fatality: Lucas Ransom, 19, was killed in a shark attack while boogie-boarding at Vanderberg Air Force in October 2010

Death by shark attack is rare. There's
 an average of 65 shark attacks around the world every year, which 
typically result in two or three deaths, according to the Pew 
Environment Group.

According
 to NBC7, a survey of shark attacks released in 2011 showed surfers were
 attacked in slightly more than half of the cases globally.

Swimmers and
 waders were the second-largest affected group, making up 38 per cent.
