At least 29 people, including 20 women, have been shot dead in Iraq in an apparent attack on a brothel.

Gunmen wearing camouflage burst into two apartments in Baghdad yesterday evening before massacring everyone inside, according to police.

While no group has yet claimed responsibility for the murders, locals believe the killings were carried out by Shiite militants opposed to prostitution.

A police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'When we walked up the stairs, we saw a couple of women's bodies and blood streaming down the stairs.

'We entered a flat and found bodies everywhere, some lying on the sofa, some on the ground, and one woman who apparently had tried to hide in a cupboard in the kitchen shot to death there.'

The attacks happened late on Saturday night at an apartment block in Zayouna, a mixed Sunni and Shiite district of Baghdad.

Police believe men using silenced weapons carried out the executions, before scrawling 'this is the fate of any prostitution' on one of the doors.

Officers have now cordoned off the street, with residents reporting that the sole access point to the building has been blocked off.

Shiite militias have become more active on the streets of Baghdad since Sunni militants led by jihadist fighters took over large swathes of eastern and northern Iraq a month ago.

While nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is thought Shiite militants are behind it

Sunni ISIS fighters have seized most of the country's north, including all of its borders with Syria, in an attempt to set up a single Islamic state across country lines.

The sudden assault by ISIS earlier this year lead marches by Shiite Muslims in Iraq's capital in a show of defiance.

Violence is at its highest level in Iraq in recent years according to the UN, with 2,417 people killed in June, the majority of them civilians, the highest number since 2007.

The latest attacks in Baghdad mirror executions carried out by Shiite militias in May 2013 in the same district, when gunmen attacked brothels and alcohol shops.

Seven women and five men were killed on that occasion after gunmen burst into a brothel, while 12 shopkeepers died after militants restrained a nearby police officer before shooting them.

The deaths happened in the Zayouna district of Baghdad, the same district where seven women and five men were shot in a similar attack in May last year
