Nine-year-old Giuliano Stroe knows what it means to knuckle down after school ... but not with his homework as you might expect.  

Instead he goes straight to his bedroom and wraps his hands round a balance bar before doing some vertical press ups - knuckles down, of course.

That's because the super-fit schoolboy, from the village of Icoana in southern Romania, has been pumping iron since he was a toddler, and is now as strong as a nine-year-old can be.

Superboy: Nine-year-old Giuliano Stroe, from the village of Icoana in southern Romania's Olt County, has been pumping iron since he was a toddler, and is now as strong as a nine-year-old can be.

Knuckling down: When he gets home from school, he goes straight to his bedroom and clenches his fists before doing some vertical press ups - knuckles down, of course

He also likes lifting weights and performing pull ups, all before his mother, Ileana, serves up his tea.

To celebrate his start in Year 5 at his school the youngster posted a new video of himself on the internet performing an astonishing series of 90-degree press ups.

After balancing himself on his hands he then pushes himself vertical and then smoothly lowers himself until he is horizontal again with his arms locked. 

In 2009, he became the Guinness World Record holder for the fastest ever ten metre  hand-walk with a weight ball between his legs.

He performed the stunt in front of a cheering live audience on an Italian TV show, and has become an internet sensation  on YouTube.

Then, in 2010 he broke the world record for the number of 90 degree push-ups.

He also has unofficial records including 20 pus-hups on four glass bottles,  90 degree pushups on two rings and a one handed handstand for more than 20 seconds.

He got into bodybuilding thanks to his fitness-fanatic father, Iulian, 35, who claims there's nothing wrong with a healthy exercise regime whatever age you are. 

Big brothers: The youngster and his little brother Claudiu (left and right) have been weight training since before they could walk and Giuliano holds a string of world records for feats of strength in his age group

Critics have attacked the family for encouraging the brothers to train so hard while they are so young - but their father says 'there's no proof of that'

Explaining his son's extraordinary video, he said: 'He was very excited about going back to school and he wanted to show his friends he hasn't been slacking during the holidays.'

He added: 'Giuliano is a good pupil and a very bright boy academically but of course his favourite lesson is always PE.'

But dad Iulian said: 'Critics say that the boys won't grow properly, but there's no proof of that. Hard work and exercise are always good.'
