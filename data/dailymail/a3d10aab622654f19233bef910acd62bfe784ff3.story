Watching Dorothy Gale skip down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City was a magical moment in most people's childhood.

But for one man, that moment was the start of an obsession - which has now led to him having one of the world's biggest collections of Wizard Of Oz memorabilia.

Walter Krueger, 28, from near Chicago, Il., became so enchanted with the adventures of Dorothy and her friends that he spent the past two decades filling his house with Oz characters, clothes and artwork - which he says are now worth more than half a million dollars.

Walter Krueger, 28, from near Chicago, Il., is such a big fan of The 
Wizard of Oz that he has spent more than £120,000 on memorabilia - which
 he now says is worth more than half a million dollars

The shop manager has given over most of his home to his vast collection, 
which he estimates consists of more than 10,000 items dedicated to Dorothy 
and her yellow brick road adventures

Mr Krueger's collection, which has taken two decades to bring together, includes a coat from the 1939 film starring Judy Garland and a first 
edition of the book, as well as artwork, clothes and characters from the film and book

The fanatic's prized possession is the replica ruby red shoes, made 
famous by Dorothy in the film, which were given to Mr Krueger by his 
mother Nancy Drew before she died. The slippers are now 
valued at around £20,000

The superfan - who says he has watched the film 'thousands and thousands' of times - has spent £120,000 amassing a massive haul of around 10,000 pieces of memorabilia, including a replica of Dorothy's famous ruby slippers. 

Now the shop manager's collection has grown so big that he is planning to open a museum to share his passion with others.

He said: 'My collection means the world to me and I’m determined to turn it into a museum.

'When I was younger I was bullied horribly at school for being gay and when I was 16 my mother passed away.

'Oz became a refuge, it was something to cling on to - I can’t imagine going through that without it.'

Mr Krueger was introduced to the Wizard of Oz - which features 
well-known characters such as the Tin Man and The Wicked Witch of The 
West - by his grandmother when he was five and says its morals have 
helped him through difficult times

His extensive collection includes a life-sized model of the 
Wicked Witch of the West, the most significant antagonist in L. Frank 
Baum's children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

The superfan hopes to secure funding and turn his dreams of a museum 
into reality so children can see his amazing collection in the future

Mr Krueger was introduced to the 
classic tale by his grandmother when he was five and says its 
morals helped him through difficult times, including the death of his 
mother.

He said: 'I've lost count of the number of times 
I’ve seen the film - when I was a child our VHS copy of it had to be 
replaced multiple times.

'It was a constant gift every year that I
 would get for either Christmas or my birthday - if I had to put a figure 
on it I would say I’d seen it thousands and thousands of times.'

Now most of Mr Krueger's home - including his old bedroom - is dedicated to the extensive collection, which includes a first edition of the classic book and a coat worn in the 1939 film starring Judy Garland.

Mr Krueger said: 'My Oz collection is everywhere. You walk in through my
 front door and there's artwork on the walls. It greets you as you walk 
in'

His collection - which includes a first edition of the classic book - is now thought to be worth between $500,000 and $600,000

But the jewel of the collection is 
undoubtedly a pair of replica ruby slippers which were given to him by 
his mother, Nancy Drew. 

Made
 by the Western Costume Company to commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
the Hollywood film, they are now valued at around £20,000.

Mr Krueger said: 'They are one of the most precious items in my collection - not for their monetary value but because they were given to me by my mother. My mum was the person who ignited this passion and who fueled it for me and Oz helped me cope when I lost her.'

And although Mr Krueger is losing count of how many items he has, he still continues to add to the collection on a daily basis.

Mr Krueger said Oz became a refuge for him when he was bullied at school for being gay. He also said it helped him when his mother passed away

He
 said: 'My Oz collection is everywhere, you walk in through my front 
door and there’s artwork on the walls, it greets you as you walk in. And an Oz room as any collector would know is a room that just has amassed anything of the same theme - I have two of those in my house.

'There are costumes and dolls and toys and everything you can imagine.'

But Mr Krueger's hard work has paid off with the collection being valued at more than half a million dollars. He longs to secure funding and help to turn his dreams of a museum into a reality.

He said: 'At a recent appraisal the collection was worth something in the region of $500,000 - $600,000.

'My goals are very pure of heart. I want to have a museum and I want to preserve these things for children to see in the future.

'I won’t give up on this dream - never lose sight of your dream, that is something I believe.'
