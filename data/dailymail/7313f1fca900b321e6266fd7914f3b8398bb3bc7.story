Doctors working in emergency rooms across the U.S. are being warned to watch for overdoses tied to a new drug that can be up to 15 times more potent - acetyl fentanyl

Doctors working in emergency rooms across the U.S. are being warned to watch for overdoses tied to a new drug that can be up to 15 times more potent - acetyl fentanyl.

Scientists have said medics can expect 'an upswing in what on the surface appear to be heroin overdoses', but that are actually caused by the new opitate.

The drug - a relative of the powerful prescription painkiller, fentanyl - is being mixed into street drugs marketed as heroin.

Scientist John Stogner, from the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of North Carolina, said: 'What's frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it.

'A patient may report heroin use and have symptoms consistent with heroin overdose, but an emergency physician may find that the standard dose of antidote - naloxone - doesn't work.

'Larger or additional doses are necessary when acetyl fentanyl is responsible.

'It's never good to lose time between overdose and treatment.'

Acetyl fentanyl is an opiate analgesic, with no recognised medical use.

It is five to 15 times stronger than heroin and users typically use it intravenously as a direct substitute for heroin or pharmaceutical-grade opiods, though many are unaware that what they are consuming is not plain heroin.

A user who injects pure acetyl fentanyl may suffer severe consquences because of its extraordinary potency, experts warn.

Acetyl fentanyl is not specifically regulated in the U.S., existing in a legal grey area.

It is classified as illicit for human consumption but if a package is labeled 'not for human consumption', the product is technically legal.

'Clever and well-informed drug distribution networks will likely take advantage of the legal loophole and profit by replacing or cutting a highly-regulated drug with this less regulated one,' said Dr. Stogner.  

'One of the many downsides of illegal drugs is you just can't trust your drug dealer.

'The trend of adulterants being worked into street drugs to make them more potent is dangerous. 

'The significant potential for overdose of acetyl fentanyl necessitates more medical research and policy reform.'

Scientist John Stogner, from the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of North Carolina, said: 'What's frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it.' The drug is commonly mixed with heroin and marketed as the better-known drug
