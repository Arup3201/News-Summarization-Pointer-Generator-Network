A Shocked commuter had to double take when she returned from work to find half her car had been stolen by thieves.

Her Vauxhall Corsa had been targeted by criminals who stripped away it's vital components, leaving the body of the car where it stood.

The audacious criminals used spanners 
and other tools to dismantle the car, taking away the front panels, 
wheel locking nuts, radiator, front wings, bonnet, electrical parts and 
headlights.

Engine trouble: The front of the commuter's Vauxhall Corsa has been dismantled and taken away by thieves

Tools: the criminals went to work on the car with spanners and other toold while the victim was at work

The gang 
dismantled the one-year-old grey coloured car in a secluded train 
station car park over several hours and were today 
being hunted by police.

They also stole the Sat Nav system during the daring raid.

Police
described the car dismantling theft as “strange” and appealed for 
witnesses after the incident at the station in Leighton Buzzard, Beds.

Today PC Chris Woolley, leading the investigation, said: “The 
owner parked her car in the small car park to the north of the station 
shortly after 8.30am and returned at 4.30pm.

“When
she returned, she quickly saw all the damage which had been caused and 
we now want to hear from anyone who was in the area of the car park or 
the station at the time and believes they may have seen something 
suspicious.

Damage: The thieves also made off with a Sat Nav as part of their bumper haul

“This is a very strange incident indeed, with the damage and theft exceeding £1,000 pounds, and we are doing everything in our power to identify those responsible.

“We’re currently carrying out a number of inquiries in the area, looking at CCTV, interviewing witnesses and liaising with local police and garages in an effort to locate the missing parts and stolen items.

“Removing this much of the car’s structure would have taken a substantial amount of time and effort, and as such I am confident someone in the area would have seen something.”
