Virginia's former executioner who put 62 people to death over a 17-year career has now become the state's most vocal opponent of the death penalty.

Jerry Givens, who carried out executions until 1999, began speaking out against the practice after he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death - and after he himself ended up in jail for a crime he says he did not commit.

He now believes that the death penalty is at odds with his religious convictions, and notes that the crime rate in his state actually went up when the death penalty was re-introduced in 1976.

'From the 62 lives I took, I learned a lot,' he told the Washington Post.

Givens started working as a Correctional Officer after losing his job at a tobacco factory and in 1976, before Virginia re-instated the death penalty, he was asked to join the 'Execution Team'.

Even though the job did not pay more, he agreed to join as he vehemently believed those who killed deserved to die.

When he was 14, he had witnessed a man break into a party and randomly shoot a teenage girl dead - and in the subsequent years, he would think of this killing before he carried out an execution.

He also reasoned that because murderers knew there was a death penalty in the state, he was not committing homicide.

'I could consider those people on death row as a suicide,' he told the Daily Life.

Over the next 17 years, he executed 37 Death Row inmates by electric chair and 25 by lethal injection - although he had no formal medical training.

His first execution was in 1984, when he put Linwood Briley - one of three brothers who carried out a seven-month killing spree in Richmond in 1979 - to death.

Before the death, Givens prayed with Briley and then focused on the mechanics of the execution. But that night, he could not sleep.

'You
are not going to feel happy,' he told the Post. 'You feel for the condemned 
man’s family and the victim’s family. You have two sets of families that
are losing someone.'

But Givens went on to become one of the nation's most prolific executioners; the 62 men he put to death accounted for around 11 per cent of all the people executed across the country in those years.

Since the death penalty was re-instated in the United States in 1976, the state has put more people to death than any 
other state, besides Texas.

A total of 110 inmates, who were all convicted of capital murder, have been executed since 1982. (Texas has executed 491.)

But statistics reveal there has been less support for the death penalty in Virginia in recent years.

It has had 
fewer death sentences in the past five years than any period since the
1970s.

Robert Gleason, who was executed on January 16 after asking to die so that he would not kill again, was the first 
execution in 18 months.

This is compared with 1999, when the state put 13 people to
death in a single year.

In recent years, as the death penalty 
has become less of a key political issue, prosecutors have felt less 
pressure to recommend death penalties.

Instead, the state has brought in
sentences of life without parole, giving juries and prosecutors a 
different option.

The number of death sentences 
across the country reached record lows in 2011 and 2012 - down 75 per cent since 1996, 
according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Five states have 
outlawed capital punishment in the past five years: Connecticut (2012), Illinois (2011), New Mexico (2009), New Jersey (2007) and New York (2007).

In that time he kept his job a secret from his loved ones. For 20 years, even his wife was unaware that she was living with a professional killer.

Yet despite his belief that murderers knew what they were getting themselves into, he said 'crime went up'.

His belief in the justice system was also shaken when he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death in 1985.

Earl Washington Jr. was sentenced to death after admitting to the rape and murder of a 19-year-old mother. But he had an IQ of 69 and in police interviews, many of his answers failed to match up with the facts of the case.

Just days before he was due to be executed, lawyers secured a stay based on doubts about his part in the killing and in 1993, DNA evidence confirmed he was not the killer.

He was eventually cleared and pardoned, making him the first person on Virginia's death row
to be exonerated by DNA evidence. It deeply affected Givens.

'If I execute an innocent person, I’m no better than the people on death row,' Givens told the Post.

He added that he wondered how many of the men he killed were innocent, and blamed the justice system and its juries for allowing it to happen.

'You're the American people,' he told ABC News. 'You sentenced a guy to be executed. You give him a trial, then you send
him to me to be put to death.

'Then later on you [say] that this guy
was innocent. You didn't put him to death. I did. I performed the 
execution. So you might suffer a little. I'm going to suffer a lot, 
because I performed the job.'

Despite his reservations, he continued to work as Virginia's chief executioner into the 1990s and rose to the rank of captain in the Department of Corrections.

But in 1999, he was charged with money laundering and lying to a federal grand jury; authorities said he bought a car with a friend knowing that the funds came from drug dealing.

Givens, who maintains his innocence, was convicted and forced to resign - and his distrust in the justice system was confirmed.

He spent four years behind bars and immersed himself in the Bible. He soon realised that what he had done as executioner was not compatible with Jesus' teachings of forgiveness.

'This was God’s way of waking me up,' he said.

He does not regret his former work as he believes God put him in the role for a purpose, and took it away for a purpose.

'God said don't worry you go out and save souls. You took 62 but you can save millions,' he said.

After his release in 2004, he found work as a truck driver and started attending Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty meetings.

He joined their board in 2009 and started delivering speeches across the country about his experience and his new outlook on the death penalty.

In 2010, he gave an emotional testimony at a state legislative hearing on a bill seeking to extend the death penalty to accomplices in murders - and he helped to defeat it.

'The people who pass these bills, they don't have to do it,' he said after the hearing. 'The people who do the executions, they're the ones who suffer through it.'
