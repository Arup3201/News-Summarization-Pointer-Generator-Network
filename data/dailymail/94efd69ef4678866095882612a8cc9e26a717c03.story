Afghan President Hamid Karzai confirmed today that his national security team had been receiving payments from the U.S. government for the past 10 years.

Karzai revealed the payments when he was asked about a story published in The New York Times.

The article said the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and plastic shopping bags in return for access to his inner circle.

The cash payments are the first known to be given directly to President Karzai.

The cash payments have been made during the last ten years, straddling both George W Bush and Barack Obama's presidencies

During a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, where he was on an official visit, Karzai said the welcome monthly payments were not a 'big amount' but were a 'small amount', although he did not disclose the sums.

He said they were used to give assistance to the wounded and sick, to pay rent for housing and for other 'operational' purposes.

He said the aid has been 'very useful, and we are grateful for it.'

The newspaper quotes Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai's deputy chief of staff from 2002 until 2005, as calling the vast CIA payments 'ghost money' that 'came in secret, and it left in secret.'

It also quotes unidentified American officials as saying that 'the cash has fueled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington's exit strategy from Afghanistan.'

In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment on the report, referring questions to the CIA, which also declined comment.

In 2010, Iran acknowledged that it had been sending funds to neighboring Afghanistan for years, but said the money was intended to aid reconstruction, not to buy influence in Karzai's office.

Karzai admitted in 2010 that once or twice a year Iran gave his office between £445,000 
and £620,000 for official presidential expenses - and that Washington provided 'bags of money' because his office lacks funds.

When Iran's payments to the Afghan government were revealed three years ago, U.S. officials condemned the behaviour.

The Afghan president confirmed that Washington was giving him 'bags of money', too, because his office lacked funds.

Some of the CIA's money is believed to be used to pay off warlords and politicians who may have links to the Taliban.

At the time, President Barack Obama's
press secretary, Robert Gibbs, denied that the U.S. government was in 
'the big bags of cash business', but former U.S. State Department 
spokesman P.J. Crowley had said earlier that some of the American aid to
Afghanistan was in cash.

U.S. officials also asserted then 
that the money flowing from Tehran was proof that Iran was playing a 
double game in Afghanistan - wooing the government while helping Taliban
insurgents fighting U.S. and NATO forces. Iran denied that

A U.S. source said in an interview with the New York Times that the security agency's money, 'has fueled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington’s
exit strategy from Afghanistan.'

Another American official said: 'The biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan was the United States.'
