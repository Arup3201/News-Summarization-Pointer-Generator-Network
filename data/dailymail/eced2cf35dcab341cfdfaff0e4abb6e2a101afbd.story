It’s a privilege reserved for a lucky few but now experts have revealed exactly who is getting on board when it comes to private jets.

The spotlight has been shone on the industry's latest marketing statistics - identifying Americans as the most frequent flyers while the busiest route is between Moscow and Nice.

Billionaire entrepreneurs, chief executives and A-list celebrities are amongst the exclusive clientele, found to be 80 per cent men.

Users of the luxury crafts, which often boast private bedrooms, fine-dining facilities and the odd cinema, are typically private entrepreneurs, aged between 40 and 55. 

The aircraft provider said the United States remains the world’s leading private jet market with 60 per cent of global traffic starting and ending there.  

Popular routes include Moscow to Côte d’Azur, Miami to New York, New York to Los Angeles, New York to West Palm Beach and London to New York in the most recent data.

Europe has the second-largest market for those wanting to avoid the queues, with about a quarter of the US, with Russia representing a significant portion of overall European demand.

She said US businessman were more inclined to use the private transportation as they were 'driven by access' with huge expanses to be covered, often requiring more than one connection.

'If you are a very busy businessman having to connect between flights for meetings, it can be difficult to get where you need to go and at a time you need to be there,' she said.

'In the US there are no business flights and you really don't have the service that you would expect if you are a very busy person.

'With private flights, you can decide what time you want to set off and arrive, at a time that suits the individual and their business needs.' 

Moscow was among the top 10 routes with highest hours flown in 2013, although the political crisis of late has seen numbers fall by 15 per cent in recent months.

Popular destination: London ranks highly with private jet passengers, according to research by aviation experts NetJets

Elsewhere, private air traffic between London and New York continues to increase year on year with the UK capital accounting for a third of the most frequented routes.

Within London, London City Airport has seen significant increases traffic over the last year. The airport is seen as an important hub, particularly for those that work in the financial sector, given its close proximity to Canary Wharf and the city in general.

Dubai and the broader UAE are seeing growing traffic although the Middle East’s position as the world’s third-largest market is being challenged by the rise of traffic in China and Brazil.

The data showed traffic from Brazil to Europe has grown by a fifth each year since 2010 with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal amongst the most popular destinations.

The total business jet market in China still below Europe, estimated at 20,000 flights per year, with potential for significant growth predicted in its domestic flights. 

Nigeria has also become one of the fastest growing hubs with private departures to and from Lagos. 

Experts have put the steady global rise down to more travelers rating the plush transport as a vital business tool. Industry figures claim the flights are often cost effective for businessmen, giving them the swift access needed to close deals, often worth huge sums of money.

The ability to get anywhere, at any time, can be priceless when it comes to the limited leisure time most customers experience.

'It can be invaluable when you work really hard and want to spend time with family within a tight schedule,' said Ms Eugene.

'Businessmen are the ones that have the needs and the means to make it possible.'
