Britain is facing a judicial recruitment crisis, according to one of Britain’s most senior legal figures.

Mr Justice Tugendhat has warned that barristers are  being put off from joining the Bench by the prospect of working 60-hour weeks, ‘wholly abhorrent’ litigants and verbal attacks from politicians.

The situation is so dire that the 
Government is beginning an appointments drive – sparked by the reduction
of the judicial retirement age to 70. As a result, seven new High Court
posts, with salaries of more than £170,000, will be advertised.

Last week Mr Justice Tugendhat, a senior media law judge, gave a rare insight into the working life on the Bench. ‘One difficulty is that many of the people to whom judges have sworn to do right are very unattractive, and some of them are utterly abhorrent.

‘Another difficulty is that the oath 
is to do right “after the law and usages of this realm”. It is not to do
right according to the judge’s personal principles or preferences. 
There is no conscience clause in the oath.’

He also warned politicians about attacking judges. ‘Those who criticise the decisions of judges may not always have in mind what the judicial oath requires. This applies both to the media and to politicians.

‘If judges are publicly criticised for making unpopular decisions which the judicial oath requires them to make, no good can come of that.’

Mr Justice Tugendhat revealed that High Court Judges in the Queen’s Bench Division ‘commonly work for  50 to 60 hours per week, and they devote a significant part of their holidays to catching up with reserved judgments and other administrative work.

‘This statistic is very worrying. It has a major impact on the time that a judge can be expected to devote to a case.’
