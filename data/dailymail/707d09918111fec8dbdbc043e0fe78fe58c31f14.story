The family of an 18-year-old Miami graffiti artist who died after being chased and Tasered by a pair of Miami Beach police officers on Tuesday are outraged after witnesses described seeing the cops high-fiving each other in celebration as he lay dying.

The distraught father of Israel Hernandez-Llach has called for an investigation into what he called an 'act of barbarism and assassination' and Officer Jorge Mercado, a 13-year veteran of the force, has been placed on paid administrative leave - pending an investigation.

The teenager, an award-winning artist, was stunned in the chest after officers reportedly caught him spray-painting the front of a closed McDonald's and gave chase for ten minutes before catching him.

Shocking: At just 17, Israel Hernandez-Llach was already an award-winning artist, on the threshold of acclaim in Miami Beach art circles. He was a sculptor, painter, writer and photographer whose craft was inspired by Colombia

Thiago Souza, who was with Hernandez-Llach and acting as his lookout, said the chase began as soon as the officers approached them and told them to stop.

Losing sight of his friend during the chase, Souza caught up to him to find Hernandez-Llach face-down on the sidewalk.

'I didn’t even know they fired a Taser. I thought they just had him down and he was arrested and was just tired,’ Souza said to the Miami Herald.

'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said Souza, 19. 'I asked the cops ‘what happened to my friend?’

Souza then alleges that the police began to make fun of how they caught the teenage artist.

'He said ‘you should have seen how funny it was when his butt clenched when he got Tased’ he said, and they were all clapping and doing high-fives all over his body. It was almost like they were proud of what they did.’

It was then that they all noticed medics working furiously to revive Hernandez-Llach, after he lost consciousness.

'The cop told me he was dead. It was just a powerful image seeing my friend there, with the medics pumping him.’

Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said his department was investigating the incident and expressed his condolences to the family of Hernandez-Llach, a Colombian immigrant who graduated from high school this summer.

According to the police report, Hernandez-Llach fled after he was confronted by police about 5 a.m.

The pursuit ended with Hernandez-Llach cornered and, with nowhere to go, he began running toward the officers, Martinez said Wednesday.

To avoid physically restraining Hernandez-Llach, Officer Jorge Mercado used his Taser.

Martinez said after being 
stunned, the teenager began showing signs of distress and 
paramedics were called

He was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead about 6:15 a.m.

The boy's family held a press conference with lawyers 
at their Miami Beach apartment on Thursday to say they planned to file a
complaint with the FBI or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
over what they described as excessive use of force by the officers 
involved.

'We do not want Miami Beach police investigating the Miami Beach Police Department. We're calling for an independent investigation by an outside agency,' said Jose Javier Rodriguez, an attorney for the family and a Florida state legislator.

'There is no justification of this kind of action for a second-degree misdemeanor,' said Jason W. Kreiss, another lawyer representing the family.

Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have faced a punishment of community service, he added.

Police in Miami have not made any of the reports of the incident public, but Officer Thomas Lincoln, who wrote the official incident report said that he did not see Hernandez-Llach shot by the Taser.

He said that when he arrived on the scene the teen was 'sitting on the ground and against a wall.'.

Martinez said Hernandez-Llach fled after being seen 'vandalizing private property' shortly before dawn on Tuesday.

Bright Future: Hernandez-Llach was an awardñwinning artist known as 'Reefa,' who won acclaim for his graffiti work as well as sculpting and painting, according to The Miami Herald

He was chased by police and ignored commands to stop running, at which point an officer used his Taser, the police chief said in a statement.

Once in custody, Hernandez-Llach displayed signs of medical distress and was pronounced dead soon after, he said.

'At this time, the cause of death has not been determined by the medical examiner's office. Autopsy and toxicology results are still pending as well,' Martinez added.

The artist's father, Israel Hernandez-Bandera, called his son's death 'an act of barbarism' and an 'assassination of a young artist and photographer.'

Friends of Hernandez-Llach who witnessed the police chase accused officers of making jokes after using the Taser.

'I saw four or five cops converge on him and hit him up against the wall,' said Felix Fernandez, 18.

He said he was standing nearby acting as a lookout for Hernandez-Llach and tried to warn him when he heard police sirens approaching.

'They were making jokes about how he stiffened up when he was tased. They were congratulating each other on how they caught him,' he said, standing by a wall where friends had placed flowers and farewell notes by a solitary letter, 'R,' sprayed on the wall.

Hernandez-Llach, who identified himself by the so-called tag name "Reefa," was known for his graffiti work as well as for his sculptures and paintings.

'He did it a lot,' said Hernandez-Llach's friend, Rafael Lynch, referring to his graffiti. 'He wasn't a bad person at all. The cops didn't like him or what he looked like.'

The two often met at a Miami Beach skateboard shop where Lynch works.

Officer Jorge Mercado has a checkered history with the Miami Beach police.

According to his internal affairs record, Mercado has had six complaints filed against him ranging from excessive and battery to violating the department's code of respect.

However, all the complaints were dismissed bar one - a violation of drug testing procedures in January 2011 for which he was suspended for 160 hours.

Friends and family spoke of their horror at the death of the popular teenager.

'In my 20 years as an art teacher, Israel was one of the most unique and talented students I have ever encountered,’ said Frank O’Hare, his art teacher at Miami Beach High, where Israel was a senior.

On Thursday evening, a crowd of about 100 people gathered at 71st and Collins to remember Hernandez-Llach. They spray-painted “R.I.P. Israel’’ on the boarded-up building where he had painted his last tag — 'Reefa’ — and chanted 'No Justice, no peace.’
