Thorbjorn Jagland said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights ¿ calling it the 'best pupil in the class' - so it must let convicts have the vote

Britain is the ‘best pupil in class’ for obeying edicts from Strasbourg, a senior Eurocrat declared today.

Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights – so it must let convicts have the vote.

His comments sparked fury among MPs who accused him of talking ‘patronising drivel’.

They said that, given Britain had such a long track record of implementing judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, judges should realise they had made a major mistake by ruling it was unlawful to deny prisoners the vote.

Britain is locked in a stand-off with Strasbourg over the ruling.

At a Westminster hearing, Tory MP Nick Gibb asked Mr Jagland if it was the ‘judicial activism’ of Strasbourg that was the problem, rather than Britain ‘sliding into becoming an abuser of human rights’.

Mr Jagland replied: ‘You [Britain] are the best pupil in the class.’

But he claimed that, if the UK did not obey the diktat on prisoner, votes, it would set a bad example to countries such as Russia.

Mr Jagland said: ‘For millions of people out there in Europe this court is protecting their rights. This court is very popular’.

He said it would be impossible for the UK to leave the convention on human rights and remain a member of the council.

And he warned that Britain's international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the 'nuclear possibility' of not complying with the ruling.

Mr Jagland, whose council oversees the ECtHR, said: ‘The implications for the Council of Europe would be that other countries will start to do the same and it will be the beginning of the weakening of the whole convention system,' he said.

Rebuttal: Conservative MP Dominic Raab called Mr Jagland's comments: 'Yet more patronising drivel from the Eurocrats'

'If one says that we can pick and choose the judgments that we want to execute, then others will say exactly the same and then this convention will be another convention, for instance like they have in the United Nations.

‘They are very weak. They are there but there is no enforcement of the standards.

‘If you start to pick and choose the judgments from the court of course the court will be weakened and in the end have no meaning.’

Mr Jagland added: 'The impact for Britain as I see it would be negative. It would harm UK reputation and influence in Europe and in the world.

'Can you imagine what would happen if the UK as the founding father of this institution is to leave it?’

- Home secretary Theresa May blamed the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for the UK's inability to send the radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada to Jordan for trial. Qatada's legal team used legislation guaranteeing the right to a fair trial.

- Police have secretly removed dozens of convicted sex offenders, including paedophiles and rapists, from the Sex Offenders’ Register. Following a human rights ruling, the law was changed last year to allow sex attackers to claim they no longer posed a threat and apply to be taken off the register.

Since then, 43 applications have been approved behind closed doors, at the rate of one every five days.

- The use of Article Eight of the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the right to a family life, has prevented two foreign rioters jailed for their part in England's civil unrest two years ago from being deported.

Government anger over the use of Article Eight prompted the home secretary to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals avoiding deportation.

Ministers believe judges will be unable to ignore the new legislation, as they appear to have ignored rules introduced last July that they should only allow the use of Article Eight in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Tory MP Dominic Raab hit back: ‘This is yet more patronising drivel from the Eurocrats. The idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the European agenda abroad is a Faustian bargain Parliament should reject.'

The eurocrat made his comments in evidence to a Parliamentary committee considering how to break the deadlock between the UK and Strasbourg.

The committee has been asked to consider three options for a draft bill - giving the vote to convicted prisoners serving up to six months, giving it to those serving up to four years or keeping the existing blanket ban.

Almost 2,300 prisoners have lodged compensation claims over the denial of their ‘human right’ to vote.

Legal experts have estimated each inmate could receive as much as £5,000 depending on how many elections they missed while behind bars. That could leave ministers with a bill topping £11million if all the claims are upheld.
