Scott Brown feels a rejuvenated Darren Fletcher can lead Scotland’s push for Euro 2016 qualification.

Brown is likely to return against Gibraltar tonight despite Fletcher impressing in his absence in last week’s 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland.

The 31-year-old’s display showed the benefits of the regular football he has played since moving from Manchester United to West Brom in January.

‘Darren is probably the most experienced person in this squad,’ said Brown. ‘He has played at the top and is still a top player.

‘For us to have the benefit of training with him, to chat to him and learn from him, means a lot to everyone in the squad.'
