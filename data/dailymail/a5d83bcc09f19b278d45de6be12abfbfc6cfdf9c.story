Arsenal stars staked their individual claims to be handed the ball when the next free kick comes around by taking each other on in an individual skills challenge.

Lukas Podolski, Mesut Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla and, surprisingly, Wojciech Szczęsny took turns in striking a ball through a car tyre target suspended in goal while  manager Arsene Wenger watched on.

Each kick was accompanied by the sort of digital graphics that the Terminator used to rely on, which supposedly calibrated distance, speed and trajectory before ultimately determining the percentage chance of success.

Podolski, Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain all managed to score before Szczęsny stepped up announcing 'Poland's coming!'. The Gunners keeper missed his opening effort before appearing more surprised than his team-mates when his next shot went through.

All players completed the single tyre before the anti was raised by lining up a set of three tyres  to decide exactly who is the most accurate striker of a dead ball.

It came down to a contest between the Gunners' two playmakers-in-chief with Ozil the first to rise to the challenge. But, while the German's effort ricocheted between the tyres, the winning strike belongs to Cazorla whose sublime shot sailed clean through and into the top corner.
