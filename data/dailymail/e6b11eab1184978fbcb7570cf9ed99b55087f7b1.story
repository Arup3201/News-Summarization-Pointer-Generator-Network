A man has died from horrific injuries - which included having his hand almost completely severed - after being stabbed and tied up during a brutal home invasion at Murwillumbah, on the NSW north coast.

'Mullet' Mick Martin was reported to have been released from a Gold Coast hospital a few weeks ago after receiving a stab wound to his eye in an earlier attack.

His son, Michael Martin Junior, 25, was tied up and forced to watch as his father was tortured by the attackers on Friday.

Mr Martin, who did not survive the horrific ordeal, suffered two wounds to his chest and one of his hands was almost severed.

Emergency Services found Mr Martin, 46, a well-known Murwillumbah local nicknamed ‘Mullet Mick’, with horrific head injuries.

It is understood that an axe was found at the scene. His son escaped with just minor injuries.

Police believe the attack happened at about 3am but the alarm was not raised until a passerby called police at about 5am.

The attack followed a brutal incident two weeks earlier when Mr Martin stabbed in the eye.

Police say they are investigating any potential links between the two incidents.

‘It's a bit early to say at this point in time if they are linked or not linked,’ Tweed Byron Detective Inspector Brendan Cullen said. ‘But it's certainly an avenue of inquiry.’

His son, Michael Martin Junior, 25, was also tied up and forced to helplessly watch on as his father was tortured by the attackers in Murwillumbah on Friday.
