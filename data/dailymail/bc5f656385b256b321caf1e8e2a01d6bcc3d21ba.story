He's never been one to shy away from controversy.

And now Jeremy Clarkson has managed to rile animal activists, after he posted a photo of a huge mouse that had been flattened during rehearsals for his show, Top Gear.

The television presenter, who is currently filming his car series in Russia, posted the photo with the comment: 'Sadly, some animals were harmed during rehearsals for Top Gear Live in Moscow.'

Clarkson, 52, posted a close up picture of the animal, which lay twisted and flattened in the road.

While
some of his fans joked that the mouse could be his co-star Richard 
Hammond, 43, - whose nickname is the 'Hamster' - animal right's charity 
PETA were not amused.

A 
spokesman said: 'This man seems doomed to be remembered as an oaf and 
lout, stuck in a bully boyhood, in which it's funny to mock the 
misfortunes of anyone in a slightly different form than his own.

'His tombstone will read, "Ignorant and unfeeling, except when it came to cars".'

Clearly Clarkson has no intention of keeping his opinions to himself.

After uploading the picture of the dead creature, he then posted a picture of what appeared to be a table inside a restaurant.

The gruesome snap outraged activists who branded Clarkson for being 'unfeeling'

On
the top sat some glasses of wine, along with a cigarette and ash tray, 
apparently indicating that Russia allows people to smoke indoors - 
unlike the UK, which banned smoking in public places in 2007.

He captioned it: 'Perfection. Civilised country. Russia.'

This will surely fan the flames of indignation from groups who have protested to ban smoking in public places.

Jeremy Clarkson said Russia was 'perfect' after posting this picture which appeared to show restaurants allowed smoking inside
