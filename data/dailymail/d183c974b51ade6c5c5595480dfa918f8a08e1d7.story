Lucasfilm is suing a New York brewery to demand it stops using a name inspired by the Star Wars franchise.

The Disney-owned company says the name of Empire Brewing Co.'s 'Empire Strikes Bock' beer is too similar to the title of 1980 hit Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.

The company filed a legal notice with the US Patent and Trademark office on October 15, which claims fans will mistake the drink for an official Star Wars product.  

The Empire Brewing Company, based in Syracuse in New York, has been making the lager for seven years

The Syracuse brewery had used the term 'May the hops be with you' in a description of the German-style 'bock' lager on its website.

It also featured an advertisement proclaiming the drink a hit 'across the Galaxy' in a similar scrolling font to the famous opening used in the movies.   

The name will 'cause confusion', especially because director and founder George Lucas already sells Skywalker-brand wine, named after hero Luke Skywalker, the legal notice claims.

Empire pub owner David Katleski says the company can't afford to wage war against a Hollywood powerhouse

The brewery, which has been making the beer for seven years, said the conflict arose after it recently filed trademark papers for the lager.

Kevin Griffin, a manager at Empire Brewery, has claimed it was just a misunderstanding.

He said the beer is actually just called 'Strikes Bock', with the word 'Empire' referring only to its maker.

'I don't see why they would have any objection. It's not like we're using images of Star Wars on the bottle or on our website,' he told The New York Post.

'As a Star Wars fan boy, I'm a big dork. I'd love nothing more than to be the trilogy's official beer.

But I don't think there's any chance of people actually interpreting it that way.'

Empire recently made a push to sell the beer at venues outside its pub in Syracuse.

The pub's owner David Katleski says Empire can't afford to wage a war with the Hollywood powerhouse.

'It's kind of a 'big dog against small dog' thing,' he told the Syracuse Post-Standard.

A new Star Wars movie is currently being filmed.

It will feature a number of original trilogy cast members, including Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.

Star Wars: Episode VII, scheduled for a December 2015 release, and is set 30 years after The Return Of The Jedi.
