Goldfinger's infamous 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die' quote has been voted the best moment from the 007 movies.

The laser-charged confrontation between Goldfinger and Sean Connery's Bond was named the nation's favourite Bond moment in a new poll from Sky Movies HD to celebrate the return of its dedicated Bond channel Sky Movies 007/HD.

After 50 years and 23 films to date, Sky Movies asked more than 2,500 people to name their favourite Bond scenes as part of a special programme, Bond's Greatest Moments.

Iconic: The 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die' quote from villainous Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Frobe, centre) has been voted to number one James Bond moment in a poll

Hosted by Sky Movies presenter Alex Zane, the programme includes contributions from Bond stars including Daniel Craig and Judi Dench, Bond directors, producers and celebrity fans including Andrew Garfield and Hugh Jackman.

When informed of the winning moment, which received 10.3 per cent of the votes, current Bond star Daniel Craig said: 'Yes, that would take some beating.'

Second in the poll was the breath-taking pre-title moment in The Spy Who Loved Me which showed Roger Moore skiing off the edge of an Austrian mountain to open a Union Jack parachute (7.6 per cent), pipping the first ever, now definitive 'Bond...James Bond' statement from Sean Connery in 1962's Dr. No, which completed the top three with 5.7 per cent of the votes.

'Bond... James Bond': Sean Connery's legendary introduction came in at number three in the poll. Daniel Craig's pulse-pounding chase at the start of Casino Royale came in at fourth

Thrill ride: The opening car chase in Quantum of Solace made the top ten, despite the film dividing critics

Daniel Craig's chase across a building site in Casino Royale came fourth (5.3 per cent) ahead of The Man With The Golden Gun's barrel roll car sequence, which saw Roger Moore's Bond perform a daring car jump across a Bangkok river (4.5 per cent).

Pierce Brosnan made his entry into the poll in sixth place with 3.3 per cent for his tank chase through St. Petersburg in Goldeneye, beating Roger Moore's crocodile 'stepping stone' escape in Live And Let Die.

The eighth most popular Bond scene was back to four wheels for Daniel Craig's Quantum Of Solace Aston Martin DBS race through the banks of Lake Garda (2.2 per cent).

Explosive: Pierce Brosnan's tank chase in 1995's Goldeneye came in at six

Following at nine is Desmond Llewellyn's final scene as Q in The World Is Not Enough where viewers saw him advise Pierce Brosnan to 'pay attention 007' for the very last time.

A sombre moment rounds off the top 10, courtesy of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and George Lazenby's only turn as 007.

Following a tumultuous relationship and just moments after marrying his bride Tracy (played by Diana Rigg), celebrations were cut short when Blofeld carried out a drive-by-shooting that killed her and left Bond grief-stricken (1.7 per cent).

Grief: The shocking murder of Bond's wife, played by Diana Rigg, in'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was a sombre entry in the countdown
