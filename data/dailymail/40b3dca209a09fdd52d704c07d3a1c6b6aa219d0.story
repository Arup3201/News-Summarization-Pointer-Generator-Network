Sir John Major insisted Ukip's enthusiasm for leaving the EU is not shared by the majority of people

Ukip's enthusiasm for leaving the EU is not shared by the majority of the British population, Sir John Major has claimed.

The former Tory Prime Minister insisted each generation of Britons is 'more European' than the last, and warned if the UK severs ties with Brussels it will 'lose some of its influence and power'.

It came as Lib Dem Vince Cable warned the Tory referendum on Britain's membership of the EU was 'dangerous' and 'utterly unrealistic'.

David Cameron has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

He has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU.

If he fails he admits he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc.

Sir John, who has been tipped to play a key role in the negotiations, insisted Euroscepticism 'fades with each generation' and predicts Britain will vote to stay in the EU.

He told the European magazine, he said: 'A UK outside of the EU will lose some of its influence and power.

'That case must be used to recapture the hearts and minds of the British people. And it is a much more attractive case than the negativism of anti-European sentiment. So I'm not worried.

'There has always been a minority of the population who emotionally regard themselves as being British but not European. But this feeling fades with each generation.

'Each successive generation regards itself as more European than its predecessor. Whereas my generation put on its knapsack and went to Brighton for the weekend, the modern generation puts on its knapsack and goes around the world.'

He also dismissed Ukip for failing to resonate with voters. 'Make no mistake: UKIP does not represent the majority of the British population.

'Present the people with the broader arguments and they will be persuaded that staying within the EU is in our best interest.

'But we have to have some indication that Britain and Europe can find agreement on difficult issues and that's what the renegotiations are going to be all about.'

David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum if he is still Prime Minister in 2017, but Vince Cable warned he will achieve little and risk investment in the UK

Mr Cameron has insisted that the promise of a referendum will be a red line in any future coalition negotiation.

His demands on welfare reform include banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. He also wants tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals and the right to refuse to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels.

The Lib Dems have refused to back the idea of a vote, insisting the Tories have set an artificial timetable.

In a speech in Brussels today, Mr Cable warned the Tory approach is 'actually quite dangerous'.

He said: 'It is assuming that the other 27 countries will magically agree to British requests. It is raising expectations that changes can be achieved within the EU that will be very difficult to deliver.

'We do not think that a referendum is sensible or helpful in anyway. Precipitating a referendum in current conditions, holding out the prospect of major reforms that aren't going to be achieved is dangerous.'
