A Florida judge on Friday set a $150,000 bail for the release of a retired police captain charged with shooting dead a man for sending text messages in a movie theater, prompting a sharp rebuke from the victim's widow. 

Curtis Reeves Jr has been jailed since his arrest in January on a second-degree murder charge in connection to the killing of 43-year-old Chad Oulson.

Reeves, 71, had been denied bail several times over the past six months.

On his way out: Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa set a $150,000 bail for the release of former Tampa Police captain Curtis Reeves, Jr, seen here in court Wednesday, who is charged with fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole

Attorney T.J. Grimaldi representing Nicole Oulson, Chad's widow, decried the decision to set Reeves free.  

'This is a dangerous man,' the lawyer told WFLA Friday.
 'He does not need to be out of jail. Wouldn't you be nervous if a man 
killed your loved one at a movie theater and then was let out of jail?'

Speaking
 to Bay News 9, Grimaldi said that Reeves will now get to spend time with 
his family, whereas his client's family had been ripped apart.

'We are floored, we are devastated,' he added.

On Friday, the Second District Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Pat Siracusa made an error by misinterpreting the law pertaining to conditional release.

The judicial panel asked Siracusa to revisit his decision, giving him the option to keep Reeves behind bars so long as he can furnish an order laying out his reasoning.

The circuit court judge opted to set bond for the defendant.

Under the conditions of his release, which could come as early as Friday night, Reeves must surrender all his firearms and wear an ankle monitor, MyFox Tampa Bay reported.

The former police captain is also forbidden from leaving his home except to go to church, to the grocery store, and to the doctor's office.

In addition, the 71-year-old murder 
suspect must have no contact with the victim’s wife who was also wounded
 in the theater shooting.

In
 its decision, the appeals court stated that during a bond hearing in 
January, Reeves made a compelling case for his release, adding that he 
is an elderly man with no prior convictions.

During a pre-trial hearing Wednesday, Curtis Reeves' defense team revealed they might use Florida’s controversial 'stand your ground' doctrine at trial next year.

A trial date was expected to be set during the hearing, but defense attorneys said they were still in the midst of investigating the state's evidence, including 100 witnesses. Attorneys will meet September 10 to determine a trial date.

Both sides have said they are not interested in a plea deal.

‘This is going to trial,’ Reeves’ attorney Richard Escobar said. ‘We're going to let the justice system decide this case.’

Reeves faces a minimum sentence of 25 years if convicted.

Attorneys will discuss jury instructions, possible sequestration and media availability during an October 14 pretrial hearing.

Nicole Oulsen says she has little movement in her hand and showed the scar from a gunshot blast on her left wrist after the hearing.

Refused bail: Reeves, seen here at a February 5 bond hearing, was ordered to remain in prison until his trial

‘We are definitely disappointed that 
this will take an extended period,’ said T.J. Grimaldi. ‘It happened and
 it happened for no reason... He was totally the aggressor and there's 
no way around it.’

Transcripts
 of jailhouse phone calls between murder suspect Curtis Reeves and his 
family released in the spring revealed the retired Florida police 
captain was confident of his acquittal.

Other
 evidence made public in April by the Pinellas-Pasco attorneys office, 
including photographs taken from inside the Wesley Chapel movie theater 
where Reeves shot dead Oulson and injured his wife over a text messaging dispute shed light on the case.

Reeves,
 71, faces charges of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the
 January 13 shooting.

He is accused of gunning down husband and father Oulson and injuring his wife after the two men became involved in an argument over Oulson text messaging on his cell phone during previews for Lone Survivor at Grove Cobb 16 theater.

'When all the facts come out, we all should be in good shape,' Reeves told his family on January 16 - three days after the shooting, reports the Tampa Bay Times.

In the recordings released by the Pasco-Pinellas State Attorney's Office, he tells his wife Vivian and his son and daughter to sell his motorbike or kayak if they are in need of money.

Sudden escalation: The confrontation that resulted in Oulson's death occurred before the movie had even begun

Armed: Reeves entered the theater with this gun, which he then used to shoot Oulson

'You all need to know that you're all the love of my life. And if it need be, y'all plan on me not being there so you plan whatever you have to do to make your life easy, okay,' he said.  'My life will be easy if your all's is. Plan the future and don't spend all the money on me.'

Photographs from the movie theater after the shooting show Curtis Reeves in handcuffs sitting in a theater seat, scattered popcorn, a dropped cell phone and a spent casing from the bullet that killed father-of-one Oulson.

They also show Nicole Oulson's badly injured hand after she was shot trying to deflect the bullet that killed her husband.

Video from the scene appears to show Oulson snatching Reeves' popcorn off his lap and throwing it at him. Reeves responds instantaneously with a single, fatal gunshot.

No weapons allowed: The management forbids patrons to bring weapons into the theater

Former cop: Reeves served as a Tampa police officer but is now in jail awaiting trial for murder

Reeves has claimed he shot the unarmed Oulson in self-defense because he feared for his life.

'Like I told everybody, I've spent 71 years doing the right thing and this guy just... anyway,' he said to his family over the phone.
