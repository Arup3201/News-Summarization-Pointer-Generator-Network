A horrific video has emerged showing puppies and kittens panicking as they wait to be dissected at an animal testing laboratory.

The footage was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) at the government-licensed centre.

It shows the animals - some as young as four-weeks-old - screaming, crying and whimpering as they are taken from their mothers and killed.

Horrific: A video, filmed by an undercover investigator, shows puppies and kittens panicking as they wait to be dissected at an animal testing laboratory. Above, a researcher prepares to cut into a puppy

Awaiting their fate: The footage, captured as part of an investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), shows the animals screaming and crying as they are taken from their mothers and killed

Sad: It also features puppies and kittens - some as young as four-weeks-old - shrieking in terror as they are restrained by researchers - just seconds before they are given a lethal injection and cut up for examination

The video was taken by an investigator, known as 'Susie', who worked at the laboratory for eight months until December last year, according to the Sunday Express.

It shows puppies and kittens shrieking in terror as they are restrained by researchers - just seconds before they are given a lethal injection and cut up for examination.

Shockingly, their dissected bodies are later dumped in a bin as waste.

In the video, an employee can be seen disposing of a kitten's body - saying: 'That's you done, you can go in our bin'.

Examination: After the young animals are killed and dissected, their bodies are dumped in a bin as waste

Meanwhile, a black puppy can be heard
 screaming and thrashing around as two researchers prepare to take its 
blood at the centre, which is owned by US pharmaceutrical giant Merck 
Sharp & Dohme (MSD).

And a young canine yelps loudly
 as a female employee struggles to find a suitable vein in his leg in which to inject him.

'Oh 
dear. What a fuss, what a fuss,' the woman can be heard saying. 'Perhaps
 your leg was a bit sore. Was it from all those bleeds? Oh dear, oh 
dear.'

The employee eventually administers the lethal dose after trying the puppy's other leg - before commenting: 'That's gotcha.'

Family: Many of the animals are born at the laboratory for the sole purpose of being dissected for examination at just a few weeks old - with their healthy mothers (including this dog, above) often killed just hours later

She then adds: 'Put up a bit of a fight, didn't you, yeah?' 

The footage also shows scenes of puppies and kittens lying on operating tables as employees insert needles and cutting equipment into their bodies.

In one particularly horrific scene, a researcher lifts a motionless puppy onto a table, saying: 'Yes,
 this is where it gets messy. Right, OK. Come on then little fella.

'Let's make sure you have departed before we start getting our bits and pieces.'

A staggering 92 puppies, 10 adult female dogs and at least 15 kittens were killed during the investigation at the centre, according to BUAV.

Eating: Some had reportedly been imported into the UK from overseas breeding farms at just a few weeks old - causing them to suffer from ulcers, high temperatures and weight loss. Above, dinner time at the centre

However, the undercover investigator managed to rescue two adult dogs, Bonnie and Billie, and a five-month-old puppy, Oliver, during the project - while two others were rehomed. 

Many of the animals are believed to have been born at the laboratory for the sole purpose of being dissected for examination at a young age - with their healthy mothers often killed just hours later.

Others had reportedly been imported into the UK from overseas breeding farms at only a few weeks old - causing them to suffer from ulcers, high temperatures and weight loss. 

Action: Home Office minister, Norman Baker (above), is believed to have called for a full report into the laboratory's activities

During the eight-month period, the facility also dissected a number of rabbits and chickens, according to BUAV.

Today, Michelle Thew, chief executive of BUAV, said the union had released the video in a bid to add transparency to the public debate about animal testing.

'This is a secret the research industry would never want to be 
released into the public domain,' she said.

'Millions of families throughout the UK 
who share their homes and lives with cats and dogs will be appalled by 
these revelations.

'It is unacceptable, not only that these animals are 
suffering and dying in this way, but that many of them could have been 
released into loving homes instead of being killed and discarded for 
convenience sake.'

She added that thousands of dogs and hundreds of cats are used in research every year in UK, despite widespread concern about their use.

Meanwhile, Home Office minister, Norman Baker, told the Sunday Express his department had carried out 'a number' of inspections at the  
facility over the past year - but added that he has now called for a full report into the centre's activities.

MSD told MailOnline that it 'adheres to all regulatory standards of testing and development of 
vaccines'.

It added that it is obliged by law to test certain drugs on animals, including vaccines for kennel cough, parvovirus and feline calicivirus.

A spokesman said: 'Animal well-being is core to our mission. All MSD animal health research is performed by qualified, trained personnel.

'Our facilities are in full compliance with all laws and regulations, and procedures and facilities are regularly reviewed and inspected by relevant regulatory authorities.'
