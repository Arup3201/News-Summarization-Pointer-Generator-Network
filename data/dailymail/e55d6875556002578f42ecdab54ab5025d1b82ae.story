A Spanish man is recovering from serious injuries after a bull-taunting backfired and the beast turned on him.

Jose Briseon, 51, had been standing by the sidelines of a bull-run in Duenas, in the northern Spanish province of Palencia, when he decided to throw a bottle of water at the raging animal.

Footage from the event shows how the bull turns on Mr Briseon, tosses him up, gores him on his horns and tramples him

Mr Briseon can be seen as one of several men taunting the bull, and as he throws the bottle at the animal, he gets its full attention.

When Mr Briseon turns to flee, the bull can be seen cornering him and hurling him into the air with its razor sharp horns.

As the crowd groans, the bull tosses Mr Briseon up for a second time using his horns, before trampling him under his hooves into the ground.

Spectator Amandio Frias said: ‘The man was tossed around by the bull and was screaming in pain as horrified spectators watched on helpless.

‘He was one of several tormenting the bull and trying to get the bull to notice him.

‘Unfortunately for him, the bull really did notice him and gave him his full attention,’ he added.

Officials say the victim is recovering in hospital from severe gore wounds.

‘It is part of the experience of a bull run. Sometimes the bull has his way, sometimes you have yours.

'It is a chance you take when you take part in such races,’ one official said.

‘Bulls are dangerous creatures and every year people get seriously injured and even killed by the creatures.’
