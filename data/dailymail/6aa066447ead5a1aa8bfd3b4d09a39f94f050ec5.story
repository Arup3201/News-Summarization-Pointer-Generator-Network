A statement released by the club

tragic death of Nevin Spence, a much-loved and talented member of the 
Ulster squad.

'Ulster Rugby also wishes to express its deep sorrow at the death of Nevin's father Noel and brother Graham.'

Chief executive Shane Logan added: 'I am deeply saddened by this tragic news.

'Nevin was a wonderful player but 
also a wonderful person. He was well liked by everyone who knew him and 
his loss will be deeply felt by his team-mates and everyone at Ulster 
Rugby.

'He will be sorely missed and the thoughts of everyone involved in the game are with his family at this time.'

Irish Rugby Football Union president Billy Glynn also expressed his condolences.

A statement from Glynn released by 
the IRFU read: 'This is a terrible tragedy that has struck the Spence 
family and the thoughts of everybody in Irish Rugby are with them at 
this time.

'Nevin was an outstanding young 
player which was evident from his progression through the representative
ranks and the game has been robbed of a very talented young man.

'On behalf of Irish Rugby, I would 
like to offer our heartfelt support to the family, friends and 
team-mates of Nevin during this difficult time.'

The Northern Ireland Ambulance 
Service (NIAS) said it responded to a 999 call at about 6.15pm following
reports that at least three people had fallen into a slurry tank.

The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service also attended and rescued four people from the slurry pit.

Following the lengthy rescue 
operation it was confirmed that three men had died and a woman was taken
to hospital for treatment for the inhalation of fumes.

A spokesman for the ambulance service
said: 'Three were unconscious and NIAS paramedics commenced 
resuscitation efforts immediately assisted by other ambulance personnel.

Tragedy: Large numbers of emergency service vehicles attended the farm

'One of the four showed initial signs
of responding to the efforts of the crews and was transported 
immediately to the nearby Lagan Valley Hospital, where unfortunately he 
died a short time later.

'Despite the best efforts of all involved the other two men died at the scene.

'A female was treated at the scene 
and taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where she is recovering from 
the effects of fume inhalation.'

Ulster fly-half Ian Humphreys led the
tributes on Twitter to his former team-mate, who was a member of the 
squad that reached the Heineken Cup final last season and was predicted 
to have a glittering international career ahead of him.

Spence made 42 senior appearances for
Ulster and was named Young Player of the Year at last year's Irish 
Rugby Football Union Players' Association Awards. He played for the 
Ulster Ravens, the club's 'A' team, against Munster A on Friday.

Robinson wrote: 'Deeply saddened to hear of the tragedy in Hillsborough
this evening. My thoughts and prayers are with family at this time of

Tributes also appeared on feeds

The Lions post read: 'All our thoughts are with the family and friends of Ulster centre Nevin Spence, his father and brother.'

The post on the Pro12 account read: 'Shocked. We just read about Nevin Spence. RIP. There are no words.'

unbelievably sad.'
