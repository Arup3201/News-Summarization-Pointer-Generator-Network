Forget sequins or glitter, Anya Hindmarch used Daz, Ariel and even digestive biscuits as handbag embellishment at her AW14 show today.

The British accessories designer transformed her London Fashion Week catwalk-turned-conveyor-belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen, glamorous lady shoppers pushing trollies and all the usual household essentials transformed into handbags.

Anya unveiled her crisp packet clutch last season but has taken her design skills a step further.

Good enough to eat (or smoke): The British designer's handbags were emblazoned with Kellogg's cereals and even Swan match packets

For AW14, her Georgiana clutches, which were made from soft chalk goatskin, were emblazoned with washing detergents packaging and even a packet of Swan matches.

'This collection began with the idea of finding beauty in the banal,' said Anya.

'The vivid "pop" graphics of a washing powder box or the guilty pleasure of the humble chocolate digestive.

'I wanted to treat the everyday ordinary in an extraordinary way.'

They're greeeeaaaaat! Even Tony the tiger was a star of one of Anya's totes

Speaking about her dramatic show, which had front row regulars Poppy Delevingne and Olivia Palermo in a fit of giggles, Anya said: 'The supermarket conveyor belts are a playful take on those small unforeseen events that can change your life: a sliding doors moment and the luck of a chance encounter, passing someone in the airport for a moment or a door opening to reveal the unexpected.

'Its about celebrating the small things and seizing the moment to "get happy",' she said.

Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy.

That's handy! Peckish this afternoon? No worries, just grab a biscuit from your bag

Noting that drawstring leather duffles were popular, she borrowed Â£600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harpers and Queen.

A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans.

Sorry, Cara. It looks like your new Mulberry totes have been knocked off the season's most coveted list.
