Sam Clucas‘s extra-time double set up Chesterfield’s first competitive meeting with county rivals Derby in 27 years.

Full-back Clucas scored twice, the second a superb 25-yarder, to terminate Scunthorpe’s three-month unbeaten run and book the fourth-round FA Cup tie with Steve McClaren’s Championship promotion chasers later this month – their previous one came in the third tier of English football in 1988.

Stubborn Scunthorpe – whose previous defeat in any competition came way back on October 25 – were finally broken midway through the extra 30 minutes when a flowing Chesterfield move instigated by winger Gary Roberts saw Eoin Doyle slipped into the area and his square ball was guided in by Clucas at the far post.

The result was settled with just under five minutes left, however, when Clucas seized on a loose ball outside the area, looked up and curled a delicious effort beyond the grasp of the impressive Scunthorpe goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.

Roberts almost made it 3-0 with the final action of the night at the Proact Stadium but his howitzer of a free-kick crashed back off the crossbar.

Paul Cook’s team, with one defeat in their previous 13 matches, began the resumption of the tie in the ascendancy having clawed back a two-goal deficit at Glanford Park a week ago.

But Slocombe kept the 1997 semi-finalists at bay for the opening 45 minutes with an array of fine saves and it appeared that Scunthorpe would be involved in another shoot-out – having beaten non-league Worcester City 14-13 on penalties last month – before Clucas had the final say.

The Derbyshire club could have been ahead inside the opening minute as a fast break culminated with right-back Tendayi Darikwa’s first-time shot at the far post being blocked by Scunthorpe goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.

It was a busy evening for Slocombe despite the spoiling of Eddie Nolan, in front of the back four. Although it stemmed the waves of home attacks it could not still them altogether and Slocombe was forced to tip over an improvised dink from Eoin Doyle, League One’s top scorer, and then repel a drive from Armand Gnaduillet around an upright.

Mark Robins’ visitors might have made them pay with their one clear-cut chance of the first half but Lyle Taylor’s attempted lob of Tommy Lee, following a ball over the top of the home defence, lacked precision.

Immediately after the break, Doyle curled another effort just wide but Scunthorpe also threatened in a brief purple patch with Paddy Madden’s shot on the hour searing agonizingly off-target.

At the other end, the visiting defence remained resolute under increased pressure: Sam Hird’s improvised chested effort from a corner gleefully clutched by Slocombe who was then thankful to Sam Morsy’s indecision when clear and Miguel Llera’s stooping defensive header as the ball bobbled across the six-yard box.

Scunthorpe are not beaten easily. In addition to their recent run, this time last year, under previous manager Russ Wilcox they completed a club record 28 matches without defeat.

But Clucas’ class told in the end.
