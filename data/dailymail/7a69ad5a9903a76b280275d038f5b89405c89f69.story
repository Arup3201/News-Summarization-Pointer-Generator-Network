'Talented': Valerie Graves ran her own craft studio and gallery called Fin Taw at the Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre in Roxburghshire

A grandmother murdered in a £1.6million waterside mansion was attacked and killed in her bedroom, police revealed yesterday.

Valerie Graves, 55, who had been house-sitting over Christmas with family, was found beaten to death with head and facial injuries on Monday morning.

Although police released details of where mother-of-two Miss Graves died, they gave no indication they were any nearer to solving the mystery of her death.

Miss Graves, an artist, had been staying at the house – in a village featured in ITV drama Midsomer Murders – with her sister Janet, 60, Janet’s architect boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, and the sisters’ elderly mother Eileen, 87.

She went to bed at around 10pm on Sunday, and nothing more was heard of her. Twelve hours later, she was found dead in her room, at the rear of the house.

Ernie Mears, 80, who enjoyed a meal with Miss Graves’ family at the property on Boxing Day, said Miss Graves usually slept in a bedroom on the ground floor of the house and the other relatives normally slept in upstairs bedrooms.

The retired builder, a friend of the victim’s mother, added: ‘I just can’t believe that somebody would break into the house … If it had been a burglary she would have screamed because Nigel, Jan and Eileen were upstairs.’

No struggle or cries for help appear to have been reported by her relatives in the house and police yesterday refused to say whether Miss Graves was asleep or in bed when attacked.

While detectives have not ruled out the possibility she was killed by a random intruder, they are also investigating whether the attack was carried out by somebody  she knew.

Emotion: The victim's son Tim Wood paid tribute to her today while sitting alongside his sister Jemima Harrison

Distraught: The siblings were visibly emotional as Mr Wood read out his statement at a press conference

Asked about the Daily Mail’s discovery
 that the house is linked to a swinger’s club – which the owner denies 
any involvement with – police said they were ‘investigating the full 
circumstances of what happened’.

The killing took place in the picturesque waterside village of Bosham, West Sussex.

The
 six-bedroom house, which backs on to an inlet from Chichester harbour 
and boasts its own jetty, is owned by businessman Malcolm Chamberlain, 
66, who is on holiday in Costa Rica with his wife Caroline.

Yesterday Miss Graves’ son Tim Wood, 
31, told journalists his mother’s murder had been ‘devastating’ and a 
‘complete shock’ for the family.

Questioned: Roy Wood - the father Miss Graves' two children - was questioned but not arrested

Struggling
 to contain his emotions, he said his mother, originally from Essex, had
 recently moved to Sussex from Scotland to be closer to her family.

Mr
 Wood who entered the conference holding hands with his sister Jemima 
Harrison, 33, said: ‘Our mum was much loved and will be sorely missed by
 her whole family.

'She was a free spirit who enjoyed her life and was a 
talented artist.’

He added: ‘This has been devastating for the family and has come as a complete shock.

‘We
 would appeal to anyone who has any information about this, no matter 
how trivial it is, to contact the police to help us catch whoever has 
done this horrible act.’

Mr
 Wood is Miss Graves’ son by her ex-partner Roy Wood, 65, a former rock 
band roadie who has been questioned by police but not arrested or 
cautioned.

Detective 
Superintendent Nick May would not confirm whether there had been a 
struggle before the killing and suggested a botched burglary could not 
be ruled out.

He added that 
Mr and Mrs Chamberlain had been ‘fully supportive’ of the police 
operation but were ‘very shocked’ by the killing.

Police advised locals to keep their properties locked and to report any suspicious behaviour.
