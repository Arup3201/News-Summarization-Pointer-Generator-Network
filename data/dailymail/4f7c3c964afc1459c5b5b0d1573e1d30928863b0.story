Abandoned dogs that were facing death because they bark too loudly have been saved after hundreds of people stepped in to help.

Twin sisters Pat Hartley and Jane Wright, who run Mill House Animal Sanctuary, feared they would have to make the heartbreaking decision to destroy the animals after one noise complaint was made by a neighbour.

The 70-year-old sisters were issued with a council noise abatement order, which meant they must find homes for the 17 dogs or erect a £2,000 soundproof fence that they could not afford.

If that failed the dogs would have to be put down.

But after people heard their plight, the twins have been swamped with pledges of money to save the dogs from death row.

A law firm has even offered to provide a free legal service if the sisters, who have cared for abandoned animals since 1948, decided to fight the council order.

Mrs Hartley said the response has been 'overwhelming'.

The sanctuary, in Fulwood, Sheffield, 
costs £3,000 a week to run and, although they receive donations, the 
sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash.

They feared they may have to close it after the council issued the order.

But now Mrs Hartley thinks they will have enough money to build the fence.

She said: 'The the phone hasn't stopped ringing since 6.30 each morning.

'We just cannot believe the support we have received from all over the country and even abroad.

'All these dogs were abandoned, their owners didn't want them or couldn't care for them but this shows people really care because at the moment there are so many animals being abandoned.

'We are so grateful to everyone who has offered their support. You don't realise how nice a lot of people are.

'We think we will get enough to buy the fence, because quite a lot of people have pledged to send us money.'

The animal sanctuary is also home to 10 cows, 10 ponies, seven pigs, five sheep, five llamas and three goats.

The sisters began caring for animals when they were just six when their family saved a young pony called Dolly because a neighbour was sending her to be slaughtered.
