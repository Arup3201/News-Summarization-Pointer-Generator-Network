Knowing that speculation was rife that baby North would make her first public appearance on Monday's Fox premiere, Kris Tweeted a picture of her cradling a dark-haired baby just minutes before the show started.

'You never know who will stop by our show today #watch Kris, she wrote.

Cheeky tease: Kris Jenner posted this picture ahead of her talk show debut in the knowledge that everyone wants to see baby North West, but at the END of her first hour she revealed it to be her stylist's child

And it wasn't until the very end of 
her first hour that the 57-year-old appeared with the precious tot only 
to hand the infant over to its mother... her stylist Monica.

The
ruse finally uncovered, Kris said she wouldn't 'kidnap' Kim's baby and 
insisted her daughter would be revealing the month-old in due time.

But the baby North effect had been fully exploited for promotional purposes, without her even leaving her home.

This wasn't the only family heartstring that Jenner pulled at during the show, 'I
promised I wouldn't cry,' Jenner she spluttered as her daughter Khloe 
Kardashian shouted support from audience just seconds into the premiere.

'She's not locked in a closet': Kris also shot down the rumours that she's keeping Kim under wraps to raise price for first picture of North 

Family support: Brandon Jenner, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian all came along to support Kris

'Thank
you Khloe, you get a raise in your allowance now,' Kris - who was 
dressed in a favourite black and white combination - yelled back.

But then it was back to Kim as Kris dished on her dramatic labour.

She
also shot down rumours that Kim,32, is in hiding under her orders so 
they can get raise the price of North's first picture and laughed: 
'She's free to go wherever she wants, Kim isn't locked in the closet,' 
and said her daughter wouldn't be marrying boyfriend Kanye West... in 
Egypt at least.

The presenter helmed her titular hour on Fox 5 in the US with some degree of aplomb, and a very familiar narrative plot.

Excited: Kris Tweeted modestly ahead of her new show

Debut slot: The first episode of Kris will see former All My Children star Cameron Mathison co-host with Kris

A
black and white checked floor and spiral staircase mirroring Kris's 
foyer makes her new studio instantly familiar, and of course, she was 
soon dishing on her famous family.

She kicked off the show by revealing the 
drama and secrets behind daughter Kim's dash to hospital on June 14 to 
deliver her baby daughter North five weeks early.

'How did you get Kim from home to hospital without anyone seeing?' co-host Cameron Mathison asked.

'There's
a little back story to that,' she said. 'I was doing Good Day LA, they 
had sent a limo for me to do it so I was offline as it's live TV, I hate
opening my Blackberry after that and then I've got an email from Kim 
marked '"urgent."'

Staying hidden: It remains to be seen whether Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian will make her first appearance since giving birth to baby North on July 15th on the first episode of her mother's Fox talk show

'For Father's Day she had been planning this big thing for Kanye,' Kris explained. 

'He's
obsessed with Apple so she wanted to get memorabilia but she had got 
nowhere, so she called Steve Wozniak and he said he'd bring her a mouse,
drive it all the way down from San Francisco and meet Kanye for 
brunch.'

'I thought the email was about that but when I opened it, it read: "I have to have the baby today, get here today, fast."'

'So I say to the limo driver, who I 
don't know at all "sir can we make a pitstop?" There's 300 paps outside 
Kim's house, the guy takes a detour and the paps start clicking away... 
the poor guy doesn't know what's going on.

'That would be kidnapping': The fame-hungry matriarch then admitted she would not be bringing the newborn daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on to her series

"But
we get Kim in the limo and I start trying to put the elaborate plan we 
had set in place for five weeks away with decoy cars and security, 
thinking how am I going to do this?'

'I call my friend for decoy car, and the plan is we get to the hotel and switch cars.

'We
go to the hotel, Kim's under the blankets tapping away on her phone and
I'm like, "who are you emailing?" "I'm emailing Steve Wozniak," she 
said.

'"Could we stop with the Woz!" I told her, let's go to the hospital!'

'We get to the hotel, and we're so smooth but when Kim pops up, I see Steve Wozniak and his wife Janet standing in the foyer!'

Rubbing down Antonio: Kris continues its six-week trial run Tuesday afternoon on Fox stations in New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Charlotte, and Dallas

'Kim
then heads over like nothing's wrong to chat to Steve and Janet, she's 
acting like she's at a cocktail party and I'm panicking.'

'Finally
we get in the getaway car, and Kim lies down then yells "mom, hit the 
floor" we're in a Mini Coupe and there was no room, but I did it.'

'Then
at the hospital, we hit the secret carpark, we head in through the 
secret elevator and through the kitchen and then we have a baby.'

'I went back on Father's Day and guess who was in the room? Steve Wozniak.'

Getting things cooking: Kris will reportedly feature a celebrity co-host each week including P. Diddy, Maria Menounos, and Nene Leakes

Kris didn't go into detail about baby North and after disappointing her audience with the baby double, told America that she wouldn't be bringing her granddaughter onto the show.

"That would be kidnapping, I wouldn't do it to Kim, just give her some time and peace and she'll be out showing her off herself,' she continued.

Today's show was the beginning of six-week test run on America's right-wing station, she was offered support from celebrity friends including Simon Cowell and chat show stalwart Regis Philbin in a series of short films throughout the hour.
