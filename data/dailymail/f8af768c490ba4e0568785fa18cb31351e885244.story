Spectators turned out in their droves to enjoy a day at the races in Moffat, Scotland, bet on the winners, cheer at the finish line and analyse the daily form of the champions – several herds of sheep.

The annual town-centre sheep race saw the finest rams and ewes the local shepherds could find, fight to be crowned Moffat’s Fastest Sheep 2013.

The Dumfries and Galloway town held it’s very own A-Scot for the second time on Sunday, and the competition was fierce.
