Now that Jennifer in The Archers has successfully coerced husband Brian into funding a new kitchen for Home Farm  - by refusing to cook for him until he did - she is splurging on all manner of trendy appliances and materials. The crucial question is, how far should Jennifer go?

Does she really need a boiling/sparkling/still water tap and a steam oven? Does an uber-modern kitchen sit well in an 18th Century farmhouse? Would it add to the property's value should they have to sell?

If she were in London, she should have little fear in splashing out on the kitchen, argues Jonathan Hewlett, head of Savills London Region, Residential.

'In today's world, the kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house - the most important, if it's a combined kitchen/dining/living room.'

That holds true, he says, even in the poshest areas. 'I went to a six-storey house in Chelsea recently where they had moved the kitchen from the basement up to the more formal floor to make it into a family room because, as the owners said, "We live in the kitchen."

'Very formal houses will have catering kitchens but in a £1 million family home, it's worth spending £15,000 to £30,000 on the kitchen, and, say, £50,000 on a £2 million property.'

While cautioning against over-specifying
 everything, Hewlett says: 'Don't be shy in spending good money. If it's
 suitably exquisite relative to the overall value of the house, it's 
worth it.'

But the story is different in the country. Guy Shaw manages the Oxford office of estate agents John D. Wood covering the entire county. 'Kitchens have saleability,' he says.

'But while ultra-modern and trendy retro kitchens are mushrooming in the city, the "London effect" has yet to reach the countryside. Some see them as out of character in a period country house.

'The key 
to a new kitchen is purpose. If you are "turning" the property - doing 
it up to sell on - you want one that will be desirable, but you need 
prudence. Keep it proportionate and bear cost margins in mind. If the 
property is for you to live in, do what you want. But refurbishing the 
kitchen alone will not add value: that has to be reflected in the whole 
house.'

Shaw's
 motto is 'style and functionality' - and he points out that he's seen 
'solid, 25-year-old kitchens that still look immaculate'.

Anne Salisbury's kitchen in her last house was a case in point.

Fifteen years ago, she installed a traditional, hand-painted kitchen in her 350-year-old thatched country cottage in Oxfordshire - and when she sold the property last year, it was still as good as new.

The formula worked so well for her that she employed the same company, John Lewis of Hungerford, to build a kitchen for her new house, which is 'probably Tudor'. The property, also in Oxfordshire, needed a year's renovation when Anne bought it. 'The kitchen itself was tiny,' she recalls. 'It was a wonderful opportunity to start afresh and build an entirely new room.'

The result is an elegant 540 sq ft kitchen/dining room that, while looking contemporary, is sympathetic to Anne's antique furniture. At the working end is a black electric Aga with a large rectangular island with a walnut top opposite, while the muted tones of the cupboards and drawers make the rest of the kitchen recede into the background. The kitchen cost about £25,000, not including building work on the extension.

Although John Lewis of Hungerford make a range of kitchens, manager Graham Jones believes classical ones last longer than hard-edged, modish ones. 'They out-perform in looks and durability,' he says. His company has been making the same 'artisan' kitchen for more than 20 years. All external panels and doors are factory-painted MDF 'which has the toughest wear-rating of any surface'. Customised colours and work surfaces make each kitchen individual.

'Choose appliances that do what you want, not because they have 300 different programmes,' he says. 'Remember, wood surfaces can dent and get scratched and will always need oiling. Marble is unsuitable for kitchen flooring as it is an alkali stone. Even when sealed it is not impervious to acids such as vinegar, red wine or citrus.'

Jane Martin discovered this, to her cost, in her brand-new, five-bedroom house in North Oxford. Her high-end German kitchen with two double ovens and integrated everything had a marble floor. 'My daughter spilt some lemon juice. It immediately took the surface off, and got greyer by the day.'

Graham Jones says porcelain tiled floors, indistinguishable from real polished stone, are a better option. 'Real limestone, for example, is both porous and pitted. It will stain easily and grind in any dirt.'

This is not good news for Jennifer on The Archers, since she has chosen Umbrian limestone tiles. If Rory spills blackcurrant juice all over it, her wail will be heard all the way to Felpersham.
