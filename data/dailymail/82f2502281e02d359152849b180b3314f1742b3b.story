Most people have imagined what it would must be like to live as a king or queen for the day.

So it is perhaps surprising that when it comes to experiencing the utmost in opulence and luxury, a stay in Buckingham Palace doesn't quite cut it for the majority of Brits.

Instead, the most desired location to spend a night was deemed to be Sir Richard Branson's Caribbean paradise, Necker Island.

Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre Caribbean paradise Necker Island was deemed the most desired location

The 74-acre island house came top in a nationwide survey of 2,500 Brits who were asked which celebrity property they would most like to stay in.

Buckingham Palace, the official London residence of the Queen, came second in the poll, which was conducted by accommodation website Airbnb. 

It came in front of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's sprawling Norfolk estate, Anmer Hall.

David and Victoria Beckham's £25m west London mansion, dubbed the new 'Beckingham Palace' after they sold their grand Hertfordshire mansion earlier this year, came fourth, while Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's luxury Los Angeles home came in fifth place.

Sir Richard's holiday home on Necker Island has become a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty over the years

The celebrity homes that Brits least want to stay in belong to Miley Cyrus, Tracy Emin, Harry Styles, Cara Delevingne and Justin Bieber.

The survey did provide more good news for Victoria Beckham, with the public naming her most popular choice when asked which well-known individual they would most trust to redesign their home.

Designers Stella McCartney and Ralph Lauren came second and third on the list ahead of Kelly Hoppen and Terence Conran.

However, when it came to naming the high-profile stars we wouldn't want designing our home, Miley Cyrus again topped the list, followed by Lady Gaga, Paris Hilton, Katie Price and Damien Hirst. 

Buckingham Palace in London has 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms

Sir Richard Branson's holiday home on Necker Island has become a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities over the years.

The property was severely damaged in a 2011 fire that devastated the island's Great House. However, it was rebuilt a year later and can now be rented out by guests for a staggering £40,000 per night.

The private island house, which Branson has owned since 1979, boasts eight guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom.

A 1,500 square feet master suite sits upstairs that has been specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands and includes a two-person Jacuzzi.

Anmer Hall is the splendid Norfolk country residence which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move into later this month. The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding

David and Victoria Beckham have spent an extra £5million renovating their palatial four-storey London mansion which includes a gym and a massage room, as well as an underground garage for David's cars

Victoria Beckham was named as the most popular choice by Britons when asked which celebrity they would most trust to redesign their home

Buckingham Palace has served as the official London residence of Britain's sovereigns since 1837 and today is also the administrative headquarters of the Monarch.

Although in use for the many official events and receptions held by The Queen, the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every year.

It has 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms.

Meanwhile, Anmer Hall is the splendid Norfolk country residence which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move into later this month.

The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding and has undergone a complete refurbishment. It has its own swimming pool and tennis court.

It was last year that David and Victoria Beckham splashed out on a palatial London mansion as a replacement for their Hertfordshire estate. 

The former England football captain and his wife have spent an extra £5million renovating the four-storey period home which includes a gym and a massage room, as well as an underground garage for David's cars. 

When it comes to living like the stars, the survey found that a home cinema is now the most desirable feature to have, followed by a hot tub and private wine cellar.

'It's perhaps no surprise that the prospect of spending a night on Necker Island is so appealing,' said Airbnb's Nick Wilkins. 

 'But what the research shows is just how much celebrities inspire people when it comes to design and the home.

'There are over 800,000 unique properties listed on Airbnb across the globe, including many with links to the rich and famous. 

'So whether it's staying in Ronaldinho's mansion in Rio, Jimmy Hendrix's Hawaiian retreat or Denzel Washington's California beach house, guests can find accommodation that reflects their own design tastes and style.'

Airbnb is a website that allows travellers to book accommodation in other people's homes. 

The California-based company is collaborating with next week's London Design Festival to allow four leading designers to create their interpretation of the ideal home in London's Trafalgar Square.
