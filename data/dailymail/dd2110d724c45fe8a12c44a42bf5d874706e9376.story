Britain was again blanketed by fog this morning leading to cancelled flights and transport delays for the third day running.

At London's Heathrow Airport, a total of 11 arriving flights and 12 departures were cancelled.

Destinations affected included Manchester, Kiev, Frankfurt, Milan, Dusseldorf, Barcelona and Copenhagen.

A spokesman for BAA, the airport operators, warned passengers to check with their airlines before travelling because northern Europe was also affected by the poor weather.

He said: 'Today 11 arrivals and 12 departure 
flights have been cancelled and we are advising all our passengers to 
check with their individual airlines before travelling.'

Other flights were delayed but a spokesman for Heathrow said services had returned to normal by 11am.

At Gatwick and Stansted airports staff reported that flights were operating normally.

21 flights both inbound and departing were cancelled by the airport today.

Others were delayed by as much as two hours.

Last night forecasters warned that 
the fog blanketing most of the country is set to continue – and some 
areas could even see snow within a matter of days.

Frost and gales are also predicted, with a chance of ice on the roads from tomorrow.

Yesterday, motorists struggled with poor
visibility and scores more travellers had their plans disrupted as 
Heathrow was forced to cancel 64 flights.

Over the weekend visibility on the roads was less than 100 yards in some areas.

Forecasters said fog would hit the country again today before making way
for icier conditions later in the week.

The cold weather, which follows
one of the warmest autumns on record, is moving from the Atlantic.

The next few days will remain mild and cloudy in most of the country, but 
night temperatures are on course to drop to freezing in some areas.

Independent forecasters predicted snow in the mountains of Cumbria and 
north Wales on Thursday and Friday, but the Met Office said it would 
mostly be limited to Scotland.

Stronger winds will see gusts of up to 50mph in north-west England and Wales.

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: ‘We will be seeing colder nights
because of the clear skies.’

The disruption that caused Heathrow 
to cancel  40 arriving flights and 24 departing ones yesterday also affected London City and Leeds Bradford airports.

A Heathrow spokesman said last night: ‘There are currently no delays but we advise passengers to check with their airlines.’

Jonathan Powell, of Positive Weather Solutions, said: ‘There is a 
rain-bearing front that could bring a covering of snow on Thursday and 
Friday in the mountainous parts of the north.

‘Roads will be pretty treacherous as any overnight rain will quickly freeze.’
