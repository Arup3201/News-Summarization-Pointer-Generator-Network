Banks and other finance firms paid £2.55billion in compensation to wronged customers in the first half of 2013.

More than half of all complaints were upheld, with Barclays named as the worst offender - ahead of Lloyds, MBNA and Bank of Scotland.

The vast majority related to the mis-selling of expensive payment protection insurance alongside loans, mortgages and credit cards.

The number of complaints is beginning to fall after they reached a peak last year, however the sums of money involved remain huge.

Worst offender: Barclays saw the most complaints

Some estimates suggest more than 
£12billion has been handed to consumers by the banks in PPI 
compensation, money which has helped prop up family spending and the 
wider economy.

Car 
manufacturers and retailers believe that increased spending in these 
sectors can be directly attributed to compensation cash from the banks.

Some
2.5million complaints were made against financial institutions in the 
first half of the year, which was down by 500,000 on the previous six 
months. Of these, 51per cent were upheld.

The
amount of money paid out fell from £2.95billion in the second half of 
2012 to some £2.5billion between January and the end of June.

Executive
director at Which?, Richard Lloyd said: ‘Although the number of 
complaints to banks are falling, which is welcome, the figures are still
far too high and appeals to the independent Financial Ombudsman Service
continue to increase.

‘We 
want banks to deal with complaints swiftly and fairly and to explain 
what steps they are taking to stop the same problems occurring in the 
future.’

Report: Martin Wheatley, Managing Director of the FSA and Chief Executive-designate of the Financial Conduct Authority said he expected banks to put customers 'at the heart of their business'

He said the 
introduction of a new system that will allow people to switch banks 
within seven working days should put pressure on the industry to improve
services to avoid losing customers.

Some
370,733 new complaints were made against Barclays in the first half of 
the year with 62per cent being upheld by the firm. The total was down by
11per cent on the previous six months.

It
emerged this week that the bank’s head of compliance, Sir Hector 
Sants(correct), who joined in January after five years running the City 
watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is taking a leave of absence
due to exhaustion and stress.

Second
place in the complaints league went to Lloyds, which is one third owned
by the taxpayer, where the total was 253,735 with 62per cent upheld.

Third
was MBNA with 237,103 new complaints of which 36per cent were 
upheld.

The figure at the Bank of Scotland, which is part 
of Lloyds, was 222,249 with 45per cent decided in the customer’s favour.
There were 198,736 complaints to Santander with 43per cent upheld.

Close behind: Lloyds, one third taxpayer-owned, came second with 62 per cent of complaints upheld while Bank of Scotland, which is part of Lloyds, saw 45 per cent of complaints decided in the customer's favour

PPI
made up 61per cent of new complaints, ahead of problems with general 
insurance, current accounts, credit cards and savings accounts, 
including ISAs.

The figures 
were published by the Financial Conduct Authority, whose chief 
executive, Martin Wheatley, said: ‘We expect firms to put their 
customers at the heart of their business – an important part of this is 
the way they handle customer complaints.

‘Publishing
complaints data is a powerful tool that helps encourage competition 
between firms to improve their service to customers, and help consumers 
assess their relationships with banks and other providers.’

The
banks argue they deserve credit for the fact the number of complaints 
is falling and more are being settled within eight weeks.

At
Lloyds, its Group Customer Service Director, Martin Dodd, said: ‘We 
have continued to make significant improvements to our customer service 
and this is highlighted by the fact that, as a Group, we now receive 
fewer banking complaints per thousand accounts than any other major 
bank.’
