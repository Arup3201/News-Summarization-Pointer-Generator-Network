Troubled Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who was arrested last month on DUI charges, has now been linked to the drug overdose of a woman whom he purchased a house for in August.

The Indianapolis Star cites a source familiar with NFL operations as saying that Irsay could be questioned about his relationship with the local woman who died two weeks before his arrest in a $139,500 townhouse he gave her.

On March 16, the Colts boss was arrested on suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated along with four preliminary counts of possession of a controlled substance.

According to police, the 54-year-old billionaire also had $29,000 cash stashed inside a metal briefcase, two laundry bags and his wallet. He promptly checked himself into a treatment facility.

On March 2, Kimberley Wundrum, 42, died of a suspected drug overdose. She was known to have a history of substance abuse.

Overdose death: According to the Indianapolis Star, two weeks before Irsay's arrest, a woman named Kimberly Wundrum, pictured, died of a suspected drug overdose at a townhouse given to her by Irsay last August

The Star's report states that the 
Traders Point townhouse where Wundrum's body was found was purchased by 
an entity called '2009 Blue Trust,' which was administered by Colts 
executives, in June 2013.

The
 trust transferred ownership of the property to Wundrum at no cost just 
weeks later. Irsay, who is worth $1.6billion according to Forbes, owns 
the team outright.

MailOnline reached out to Irsay's spokeswoman Myra Borshoff Cook for comment but has not yet heard back.

According to the Star, Wundrum's sister Rhonda Wundrum worked as Irsay's personal masseuse.

In an email to the newspaper, she described her client and her sister as 'former friends.'

'I
 cannot speak for them, and Kim cannot speak for herself,' Rhonda 
Wundrum told The Star. 'My sister was a kind, loving and gentle person 
who had a long struggle, and her attempts to rise above her struggles 
were not successful.'

Kimberly
 Wundrum was arrested twice on drug charges in the seven months before 
her death - once on August 30, 2013, in Miami County, Ohio, and a second
 time on January 4, 2013, in Boone County.

In
 both cases she was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated 
and possessing drugs. In the latter she was also charged with criminal 
recklessness, accoridng to the newspaper, because she almost hit a 
police car while driving the wrong way on an interstate.

Detectives searching the death scene found an 'orange plate (with) white powder, straw, razor' and photographs of Irsay.

Colts
 Chief Operating Officer Pete Ward told The Star that the Blue Trust 
related to Irsay's 'personal life,' and refused to comment on it.

Irsay's
 ex, Meg Irsay, filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 
years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage.

A
 joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full 
ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.Â  The couple, 
who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the 
parents of three adult daughters.

Irsay was pulled over March 16 in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel.

He
 had the $29,000 stashed inside a metal briefcase, two laundry bags and 
his wallet, along with a shocking amount of prescription medicines, 
authorities said.

The arrest report shows a dozen items listed as prescription drugs, but does not offer any further information, according to the Indianapolis Star.

The arresting officer forced Irsay to 
sit on the hood of his car while the Toyota Highlander was being 
searched because he was unable to stand up, according to the report.

Irsay took a breathalizer, but the results were redacted, and the cop said he 'believed Irsay to be intoxicated on a substance other than alcohol,' the Star reported.

In
 an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were 
discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV 
prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles 
found in the vehicle.'

The
 billionaire has been in and out of rehab over the years and has said he
 kicked his addiction to prescription painkillers - but sources close to
 the businessman say otherwise.

Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise.

'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.'

According to the Star, Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances.

The
 night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow speed, stopped in 
the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, 
Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release.

'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said.

Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans
 of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't
 drink...haven't in over 15 years.'

Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment.

Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay.

A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs.

League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would.

'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said.

Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife.

Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion.

Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.
