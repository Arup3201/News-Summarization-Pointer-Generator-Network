A Florida man who claimed he found an abandoned baby at a gas station has been arrested after it emerged he was the one trying to dump the newborn, who belonged to his girlfriend.

Ralph Garlick Jr., 53, said he found the baby girl naked and crying, wrapped only in newspaper at about 2 a.m. Monday near the front door of the DeBary Food Mart in Volusia County.

After removing his shirt and wrapping it around the child, Garlick flagged down a newspaper delivery man who called 911 and, because it was cold outside, brought the baby into his heated van to wait for help.

The child was taken by ambulance to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando where she is in good health, despite being outside in chilly temperatures.

Garlick told police he didn't know the child and came across it at the gas station.

However, he later admitted that it was his girlfriend's baby who had been delivered hours earlier at an Orange City apartment. He is not the father and said his girlfriend, who hasn't been named, didn't want to keep the baby.

The infant's mother has been located and is being questioned by police at Central Florida Regional Hospital in Sanford.Â 

Florida is one of 34 states where a 
'safe haven' law allows parents to anonymously drop off a child younger 
than seven days at a designated location, relinquishing their 
parental rights free from criminal prosecution.

The DeBary fire station, located half a mile from the Food Mart, is one such 'safe haven' but Garlick didn't take her there.

Garlick told police he had tried to find someone to take the baby but police dispute how far his efforts went.

The newspaper delivery man, Anthony Ackridge, told Fox News 
he thought Garlick was making up the story when he first approached him asking for help.

'In a way I thought he was lying at 
first and then I heard the baby and I immediately knew he was telling 
the truth,' he said.

'She
looked really good, the only thing that I seen was a little bit of 
purple on her toes but other than that she was in very good condition.'

The baby still had her umbilical cord attached, he said, though it appeared to have been tied off with a string or nylon rope.

Ackridge added: 'I don't see how anybody could leave a baby out in this whether.'

Garlick was arrested on charges of knowingly giving false information to law enforcement during an investigation and resisting an officer without violence.

He was taken to the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach where he is being held on $5,000 bond. Police said he used the name of his dead brother, Charles Garlick, to identify himself at first.

Charges may be filed against the mother as well.

Once released from hospital, the baby will be turned over to the Florida Department of Children and Families.

DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner Proudfit told Orlando Sentinel infants surrendered under the Safe Haven law go to approved adoptive parents through private adoption agencies.
