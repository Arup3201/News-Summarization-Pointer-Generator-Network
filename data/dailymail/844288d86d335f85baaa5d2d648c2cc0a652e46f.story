Family court ruled that Victoria Rogers was to blame for fatal head injuries caused to her 21-month-old daughter Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, both pictured

A mother who was spared criminal charges over inflicting fatal head injuries on her 21-month-old daughter could now face jail for allegedly going on Facebook in breach of reporting restrictions linked to her case.

Victoria Rogers was to blame for the death of her daughter Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who died after suffering severe head injuries, a family court judge ruled.

A document released last month detailing the ruling stated that on the balance of probabilities Victoria Rogers lost her self-control and caused catastrophic injuries to her child.

But despite the damning judgment the Crown Prosecution Service has refused to press charges because of ‘insufficient evidence’ to prove who was to blame.

Miss Rogers is now accused of breaching a reporting restrictions order by putting four posts on the Facebook page 'Justice for Summer Mai'.

The existence of the family judge’s ruling at Teesside County Court was first made known last month soon after a coroner concluded at an entirely separate inquest that 21-month-old Summer was 'unlawfully killed'.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to bring criminal proceedings, which require a higher standard of proof than civil proceedings.

The CPS said it could not be established whether it was Summer’s mother, stepfather or grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured in February 2012.

Today Kirklees Council was due to apply to the High Court in London to force Ms Rogers to appear and show cause why she should not be committed to prison for the allegedly illegal Facebook posts.

The application, which is being made by Lorraine Cavanagh on behalf of the local authority, was adjourned by Mr Justice Moylan to 15 August after he heard Ms Rogers needed time to obtain legal aid for lawyers to represent her.

Summer’s grandfather James Ratcliffe has vowed to go on with his 25-year-old son Joss - Summer’s father - to fight for justice and set up the Facebook page on which Miss Rogers allegedly made her four posts.

Over 2,000 people have signed a petition urging the CPS to reconsider the decision not to prosecute anyone.

Mr Ratcliffe said he was 'flabbergasted to think that in 2014 an inquest found Summer was killed but no one has yet been made accountable'.

Summer, who lived in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was a normal, healthy child in a family with no involvement with social services, her inquest heard.

Justice: Summer's grandfather James Ratcliffe has vowed to go on with his 25-year-old son Joss - Summer's father, pictured - to make sure someone is held accountable for his granddaughter's death

Her parents split up when she was three months old. She was taken to hospital after being found unconscious in her cot at around 8.30am on Monday, February 27, 2012.

She had a severely swollen brain, which was bruised and bleeding, and died hours later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered a 'blunt force trauma' to her head.

Ancillary nurse Miss Rogers, 27, Summer’s stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, were arrested seven months later as they were the only people in the house in the time frame of the death.

All three insisted they had not touched the girl and did not know how she suffered the injuries.

The family judge said in his ruling that Summer had a tantrum after returning from her grandmother’s house on the day before she was found dying.

In evidence, Miss Rogers said she had told her daughter: 'I’m sick of you coming home like this.' Mr Sharp claimed she told her daughter something to the effect of 'I can’t stand you any more'.

The judge said: 'I... have no doubt that the mother was acutely distressed by Summer’s tantrum. I am satisfied that the mother is an emotionally fragile person who would have been deeply upset by the episode which followed Summer’s return home on the Sunday.

'The evidence does not, in my judgment, support the conclusion that anything was likely to have happened which would have caused Craig S [her stepfather] to lose his self-control in the two hours or so between the mother leaving home and Mrs R arriving.

'The evidence does support, in my judgment, the conclusion that something happened during the course of that night which caused the mother to lose her self-control.

'However hard the decision, having regard to the cumulative effect of all the evidence and, in particular, the matters referred to above, I have come to the clear conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence establishes that the injuries sustained by Summer were caused by her mother.'
