When Phil Mickelson, five times a major winner, begins checking his green maps standing over a three foot putt, it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense. Even on the first morning of the first day, the Ryder Cup can do that to a guy. Even a cool guy like Mickelson.

He stayed calm enough to drop it, though. And as it fell, Paul McGinley's marquee pairing went down the hole with it. Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia, the world number one and number three, had no way back from there. Mickelson saved his best for last, his birdie on the 18th giving America an unassailable and perfectly timed lead in the Friday session.

To be fair, it probably didn't need to be Mickelson's absolute best. The European didn't play well enough to provoke that. Mickelson made his four via a bunker, but so abject was the performance of the European pair on the final hole that this was still plenty good enough.

Neither McIlroy nor Garcia made the green of Gleneagles ultimate par five in the regulation three shots. At one stage Garcia chipped from rough straight into a bunker. McIlroy was barely in contention, either.

He had a dreadful first round, with the European team looking to him to set the standard. It was a close game, but one that Europe certainly could have won. If McIlroy had delivered even an approximation of the game that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf's rankings, it would have been too much for the opposing pair.

Instead, he was insipid, Garcia inconsistent, and America cleaned up at the death. Europe led by a hole coming away from the 15th, but Keegan Bradley eagled the 16th and Mickelson won the last to give European captain McGinley plenty to consider at the turnaround. 

In Medinah, last time out, 12 of the 28 matches went to the last hole, and Europe collected nine and a half points from those games. Here, two went the distance in the morning and Europe gleaned half a point. 

To see McIlroy and Garcia fall so dramatically was a particularly crushing blow. 'Find McIlroy and break him,' was the instruction of Paul Azinger, the last American captain to win the Ryder Cup. What impact this defeat was going to have remained to be seen, but it was certainly a positive start for Tom Watson's stars and stripes. Having got their noses in front late, nobody expected to see Europe's strongest pair crumble so spectacularly.

Not that Mickelson and Bradley are inferiors as a unit. At the end of the morning session, they were on the best run of any American duo at a Ryder Cup since Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins in 1979. Yet the golf played did not have to be that of a great partnership. Indeed, anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of Perthshire sorely disappointed. 

Far from an exhibition, this was something altogether earthier. A scrap, a dust-up, a bundle in the playground. The match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated, and wildly. McIlroy played the first home like the world number one, and the second like a club handicapper. 

Find McIlroy, as Azinger suggested? It would have been hard because he spent so much time in unfamiliar surroundings: off to the left in heavy rough, short in greenside bunkers. Nerves make the Ryder Cup special, but this better resembled a monthly medal, particularly on the long holes that professionals relish.

The Northern Irishman coming up against Mickelson was the blockbuster match-up of the opening day

The hole is a par five, but not one of the quartet took a shot off it. The tone had been set even earlier. 'On the tee, Keegan Bradley,' said the official starter on the first. The resulting was fired a long way left. 'On the 18th tee, Keegan Bradley,' said a jocular soul in the crowd. 

Bradley – identified by Europe's rabble rouser Ian Poulter as a kindred spirit in the opposing ranks – rode a lot of comments like that. 'Want tea with that slice?' crowed a voice on the fourth, as another tee shot set off along a wayward path. 

By the sixth – and a hole down after Garcia had chipped in from a bunker on four – even the genial Mickelson was getting tetchy. He snapped at a small party of television cameramen, who had taken a wrong turn and almost knocked him over as they tried frantically to retrace their steps along the fairway. 

On the eighth there was a row over whether Bradley should get relief from a lousy lie. Europe objected. 'Is there some new rule I don't know about?' asked Mickelson, tartly. Bradley's caddie, Steve Hale, was also distinctly unamused. Then again, he spent much of the morning at war with the world. Spectators, rogue cameramen, shadows, everything seemed to be getting on his wick.

What was getting on McIlroy's wick was his game. It wouldn't come when he called it. He made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation. McIlroy won the 13th and 15th holes, to take the game from two down to all square, but on both occasions with straightforward pars to American bogeys.

Meanwhile, with all the players struggling to find form, there wasn't even the predicted needle. In the phoney war that always precedes this event, Mickelson had made a jibe about the legal battle beteen McIlroy and Graeme McDowell's management company. Would McIlroy give him the cold shoulder? Hardly. On the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee, the pair shared a buggy and Mickelson put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival, laughing. McIlroy smiled back. They were both probably in need of consolation at that point. 

By the end, however, McIlroy was left to fend for himself.
