Arsenal still expect Arsene Wenger to sign a new contract but they have started planning for life without their manager.

Wenger, whose deal expires at the end of the season, has given the Gunners his word that he will stay on.

Talks initially centred on a three-year deal worth £8million a season but it is understood a two-year extension is now more likely.

Uncertain: Wenger's contract expires this summer, but he has given Arsenal his word that he will stay

Wenger still enjoys the unequivocal 
backing of Arsenal’s majority shareholder Stan Kroenke, who is in no 
doubt the manager will sign a contract that has been on the table for months.

But Saturday’s humiliating 6-0 defeat at title rivals Chelsea has nonetheless sparked uncertainty about the Frenchman’s future.

And Arsenal have started looking at 
contingency strategies should he make a last-minute U-turn and quit 
the Emirates. A long-term plan for life after Wenger is also in the 
club’s thoughts, with a new-look management structure likely. 

Roberto
 Martinez’s work in his first season at Everton has impressed the 
Gunners, as has Jurgen Klopp’s reign at last season’s Champions League 
runners-up Borussia Dortmund.  

Implementing
 a two-tier structure, which would see a head coach working under a 
director of football, is under consideration and would represent a huge 
shift in ethos. Wenger currently has the final say on all football 
decisions.

Faith: Wenger took charge of his 1,000th Arsenal game at Chelsea on Saturday

Humiliation: Arsenal were hammered 6-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon

Victory over 
Swansea would help draw a line under Saturday’s embarrassing loss but 
the Gunners go into the game without key defender Laurent Koscielny, who
 sustained a calf injury at Stamford Bridge.

It
 is feared the France centre back could miss around two weeks, ruling 
him out of the crunch match against Manchester City on Saturday. 

Alex
 Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs will be available, however, after 
the FA upheld Arsenal’s appeal over the latter’s controversial 
sending-off against Chelsea. Gibbs was shown the red card in a case of 
mistaken identity by referee Andre Marriner. Oxlade-Chamberlain, not his
 team-mate, had committed handball in the six-yard box.

Arsenal’s
 claim that Oxlade-Chamberlain had not prevented a clear goalscoring 
opportunity, because Eden Hazard’s shot was going wide, was also upheld 
by the FA.

Referee Marriner stays on the Premier League match list this weekend and will take charge of Newcastle’s visit to Southampton.

Marriner
 was expected to be dropped for the next round of fixtures following his
 high-profile blunder but referees chiefs decided to stand by their man.
