A pair of French thieves posing as police officers stole £173,000 in cash from a Saudi diplomat minutes after he had landed in Paris after they pulled him over on a busy motorway.

The robbers took a suitcase from the boot of the official's car which contained 162,000 Euros, $30,000 and £10,000.

Driving a car equipped with flashing blue lights with 'police' written on it, the thieves pulled the diplomat over on the A1 just outside of the French capital.

The armed men demanded an inspection of the car boot and said they were 'confiscating' the suitcase before telling the official, who had just landed at the private Le Bourget airport on Monday, he was 'free to go'.

A French police spokesman said: 'It is unclear why he was carrying so much cash.

'We do not know if the robbers were working on a tip off or simply got lucky.'

He confirmed that officers in the Seine-Saint-Denis department were investigating the theft.

The robbery is the latest in a string of thefts on wealthy visitors to Paris.

A group of 23 Chinese tourists were robbed in a restaurant also near Le Bourget soon after arriving in France back in March.

They were attacked by three armed men who stole their passports and around 7,500 Euros in cash.

Jena-Frangois Zhou, who runs Ansel Travel, which caters to Chinese tourists said: 'It's becoming a scourge. Since last year, we've seen attacks almost daily.'

In May, a group of France's most prestigious luxury goods companies, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Hermes, united to complain that robberies on tourists were frightening off their wealthy foreign customers.
