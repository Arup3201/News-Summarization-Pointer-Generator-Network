A nine-week-old baby reported missing has been found, but his father's location is still unknown.

Police say the baby is safe and well, but they are concerned for the welfare of the infant's dad Garry Gordon.

Mr Gordon, 25, travelled from Canberra with his baby boy on Sunday and police believe he is in the Wollongong area.

'We want to make sure he's okay, we'd like him to make himself known to police,' an ACT police spokeswoman said.

Police believe Garry Gordon snatched the baby from a house in O'Malley early on Sunday and may be heading interstate

Police believe Mr Gordon took the baby from a house in O'Malley early on Sunday at 5.40am, while the child was in care of relatives.

Mr Gordon has been described as 193cm tall, with short curly red hair, last seen wearing a dark hoodie and driving a white car. 

The removal of the child from the home is out of character for Mr Gordon, ACT police said in a statement on Sunday.   

He may be driving a 1993 grey Ford Falcon sedan with number plate YEB47J or a white Mitsubishi Solara 2001 with number plate YBR67P. 

Anyone who sees the man is urged to call police on 131 444.
