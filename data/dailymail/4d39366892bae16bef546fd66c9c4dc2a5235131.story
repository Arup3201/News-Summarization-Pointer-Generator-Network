Tensions were once again running high on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, Tuesday night after an early morning fire destroyed a makeshift memorial honoring the black teenager killed last month by a white police officer.

The memorial for 18-year-old Michael Brown that caught fire was erected in a grassy area alongside the road where Brown died. A larger memorial, which runs down the center lane of the road, was untouched by the conflagration.

Still, neighborhood residents who have been protecting and expanding the memorials since Brown was killed August 9 were outrage by the damage, and some were accusing city officials of not working hard enough to put the blaze out

More unrest: Protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, Tuesday night to express their rage after a fire destroyed a makeshift memorial for police shooting victim Micheal Brown 

Public rage: Protesters who arrived on West Florissant Avenue faced off against police, chanting that they wanted Officer Darren Wilson to be indicted 

Protests have persisted in and around Ferguson since Brown's death. And protesters have pledged continued civil unrest until officer Darren Wilson is arrested and charged in Brown's death.

At around 11pm ET, Twitter lit up with reports of possible looting and rioting on West Florissant Avenue, where several hundred protesters converged chanting, 'we want an indictment, police don't like it,' and 'no justice, no peace.'

Police responded in full force to the impromptu rally, setting the stage for yet another tense standoff.

The Blaze reported that a group of demonstrators damaged the Beauty Town supply store as screams and the sounds of gunfire filled the night air. 

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said one protester yelled, 'burn it down,' after smashing a window at the store.

The owner of the targeted business told KMOV that this is the third time that his store has been looted. So far, he has lost more than $100,000 in stolen merchandise.

On Twitter, French blamed the fire at the Michael Brown memorial for jeopardizing a 'fragile peace' in Ferguson. 

Ferguson resident Meldon Moffitt said the fire started around 6.30am Tuesday on Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was fatally shot last month by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

About two dozen residents gathered at the site Tuesday morning, many of them angry. One man said it was like a grave being desecrated.

Ferguson resident Marcus Henley told MSNBC 'I woke up to it. They light candles with no problem. I think somebody set it on fire. And that says a lot to me.'  

Many who gathered at the site Tuesday blamed police for the blaze, even as the chief said officers did everything they could to keep the stuffed animals and other items from burning.

'It's the same as if somebody came and desecrated a grave,' Anthony Levine of Florissant, another St. Louis suburb, said as he studied the charred scene and shook his head.

More than six weeks after Brown's death, residents and others remain upset about the way his body lay in the street for more than four hours while police investigated the shooting. Many insist he was trying to surrender, with his hands up.

The memorial fire and ensuing outcry was a reminder of the simmering tensions that have only deepened since Brown's death, which prompted several nights of riots and protests in the predominantly black suburb where just three blacks serve on a 53-officer force.

People who showed up at the fire scene doubted a candle was the culprit, though. Most were certain someone set the blaze. Some said they smelled gasoline.

'That's very disrespectful to burn down a memorial to someone that got killed,' said Meldon Moffitt, who lives nearby. "That's just wrong! The police came here and watched it burn.'

Investigation: Police Chief Tom Jackson said the fire department was called after a police officer with a fire extinguisher could not put the fire out

Victim: Michael Brown was fatally shot in August by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson

Ferguson police spokesman Devin James says the cause of the fire is under investigation.

Police Chief Tom Jackson said in a statement to KSDK 'We're all saddened by the fire that was reported at one of the Michael Brown Memorials this morning and are trying to obtain as much information as possible to determine what happened. At this time the cause is unknown.

'To anyone who believes we didn't do everything in our power to put this fire out I want to apologize and let you know that was not the case. Some of our police cars are equipped with an emergency kit that includes a fire extinguisher and Sgt. (Harry) Dilworth was first on the scene and attempted to put the fire out but couldn't so he alerted the Fire Department and they ultimately put out the fire.

'Anyone who has any information or videos please reach out to us as this will help as we investigate this incident.'

'There was no way a candle did this. That fire was burning too high and too hot,' David Whitt told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 

KMOV reporter Laura Hettiger, who was on the scene, tweeted the fire took place at 'around 6:40' and that no one was injured. 

Brown's death led to several days of protests and unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Investigations into the shooting by a state grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice are ongoing.
