Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has come under fire after an undercover video emerged exposing 'shocking cruelty' at a foie gras factory which supplies one of his licensed restaurants.

Animal rights groups People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are accusing the star of having double standards after filming thousands of ducks being force-fed through steel tubes.

In 2011, Ramsay made a documentary in which he condemned the slaughter of sharks to make shark fin soup.

On the Channel 4 film Shark Bait, he described the cruelty of the industry as 'sick' and 'barbaric' and encouraged viewers not to buy the dish.

But PETA have revealed how Hudson Valley Foie Gras appears on the 'Menu Prestige' at New York restaurant Gordon Ramsay at The London.

The group have released undercover footage from the farm which shows steel tubes being forced down ducks throats to fill them with large amounts of grain three times a day.

The Manhattan fine dining venue was sold by Ramsay to the Blackstone Group in 2009, but it continues to operate under the chef's name and he acts as a consultant.

A traditional French delicacy, foie gras is made from the liver of a duck or goose which has been specifically fattened and has a rich and buttery taste.

Experts say force-feeding ducks causes oesophageal tears and splits, liver rupture and failure, heat stress and aspiration pneumonia

At slaughter the ducks are hung upside down, have their throats slit and are left to bleed to death.

An estimated 15,000 ducks per year die at the Hudson Valley Foie Gras factory before they even make it to slaughter.

PETA claim experts probing foie gras production have found that force-feeding causes oesophageal tears and splits, liver rupture and failure, heat stress and aspiration pneumonia.

Mimi Bekhechi, from PETA UK, said: 
'Every expose of foie gras farms has revealed how grotesquely cruel it 
is to jam pipes down birds' throats and force-feed them until they 
sicken and die.

'We hope Gordon Ramsay and other chefs will swear off this particular 'f-word' - foie gras - for good.'

The group has written a letter to Ramsay urging him to take foie gras off the menu.

Ramsay got his first taste for catering at the North Oxfordshire Technical College where he studied Hotel Management. 

In the early 1980s, he worked as a commis chef at the Wroxton House Hotel then ran the kitchen and 60-seat dining room at the Wickham Arms.

He then moved to London, where he worked for Marco Pierre White at Harvey's for two years

After working at Harveys for nearly three years he switched to work for  Albert Roux at Le Gavroche in Mayfair before working as his number two at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the French Alps.

From there, Ramsay moved to Paris to work with Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon, both Michelin-starred chefs. 

Returning to London in 1993, he took head chef role at La Tante Claire in Chelsea before working in the same capacity for  Marco Pierre White at the Aubergine which went on to win its first Michelin star fourteen months later. In 1997,

In 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson. 

From here he expanded rapidly his empire from London to Glasgow, Dubai, Tokyo and New York. It has, however, been a difficult few years for the chef

He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running row over his business in 2012.The pair went their separate way after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH).

He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'.

Ramsay's fiscal situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.Gordon Ramsay sold his restaurant in Prague - Maze at the Hilton in Prague's Old Town - back to the hotel in 2009

Also in 2009, he sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel.

The father-of-four closed two eateries in Australia in 2011, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel.

Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons

A representative of Hudson Valley Foie Gras said: 'The PETA film is from a tour I gave. I see myself in the video. We do this to provide the total picture of what we do for interested people.

'We do not film the slaughter for our film as it is basically the same as every other poultry processing plant in the world, although we do show visitors. That is the way poultry is processed. The clip does not show the birds being gently handled and put to sleep before the slaughter.

'We invite people to take pictures on the tours. Other people have posted these videos of fragments from the tours. We will continue to bring people to the farm so they can see the whole truth.'

Gordon Ramsay's representatives failed to respond to a request for comment.

A spokesman for Gordon Ramsay at The London said: 'We do not in anyway condone cruelty to animals. We strive to provide our guests with the finest quality ingredients and we seek to work with purveyors who are able to deliver on that promise.

'We are amongst a number of New York City restaurants that provide this delicacy based on the discerning tastes and desire of our diners.'

Gordon Ramsay is the owner of 27 restaurants and holds 11 Michelin stars.

It was revealed in February this year that his contract to run the restaurant at Claridge’s hotel was not being renewed.

His
 12-year stewardship of the Art Deco dining rooms at the five-star 
Mayfair hotel will end in June after talks aimed at reaching a new 
agreement broke down.

The 
notoriously fiery chef is understood to have withdrawn from negotiations
 after becoming annoyed at the length of time it was taking to finalise a
 new deal.
