Forest boy: Artist's impression of 'Ray' who claimed he lived in the wild

German authorities said the fate of the mysterious English-speaking ‘Forest Boy’ will forever remain a secret from the world.

'He wants no publicity and we have nothing more to say on this subject,' said a spokesman for youth authorities in Berlin.

'We will not enter into discussions about secrecy or otherwise. There will be no more information forthcoming on this case.'

Despite the German taxpayer stumping 
up close to £5,000 a month for his upkeep, the spokeswoman said that his
 wishes 'come first.'

But sources say his claim to have been
 brought up in a forest - and to have buried his father in a shallow 
grave - have been proved false.

One insider said; 'He is regarded now 
as a fantasist with some mental health issues. There was no wood, no 
grave, no mother who died in a car crash. He is just now just something 
of an unfortunate.'

The German authorities will not even say where he is being kept.

The boy, known only as Ray, hit the headlines in September 
last year. Speaking in broken English, he walked into a town hall in the
 east of Berlin and claimed to remember few details about his life.

But he spun a tale - in accented English - that gripped the imagination of the world.

He said he had been living in a tent 
in a forest for five years with his father, called Ryan, and that his 
mother Doreen had died in a car crash five years previously.

He said that his father died suddenly 
in the woods and he began walking towards Berlin. He said he had buried 
his father among the trees. ‘I’m all alone, please help me,’ he said.

Lost in translation: The boy turned up in Berlin alone and saying he had been living rough in the woods

But his tall tale soon began to develop more holes than a Swiss cheese.

A check of police computers in all 16 
states of Germany found that no one by the name of Doreen had died in a 
car crash in the past decade.

No sign of a grave has been found in 
cursory searches of forests in the Harz Mountains, along the 
Bavarian-Czech border or in Thuringia.

Ray is unable to pinpoint the forest where he said he lived, he is also unable to say what nationality he is.

Officials originally thought he could be British because he speaks English but only basic German, although they now doubt this.

The tent he carried did not look as if it had sustained five years of treatment in a forest and Ray was well dressed and clean.

As Interpol was alerted to check with 
police forces for missing people in other European countries, Ray 
triggered more suspicion when he said he did not want to pose for 
photographs or make an appeal to try to find any of his family.

‘They’re all dead,’ he said. ‘I just want to get on and make a new life for myself.’

A police spokesman said: 
‘Unfortunately it seems that the boy told his guardian that he wasn’t 
interested in discovering who he was.’

Several people from around the world 
have claimed to be his relatives, including a Swiss couple who said he 
was their missing grandson. But no real relative has been found.
