Manchester United misfit Bebe has expressed a desire to move to Benfica as his bizarre career in England looks to be drawing to a close.

The 24-year-old, who did well while on loan in Portugal last season, has still never played a Premier League game for United, despite signing for £7million four years ago.

And in an interview with Portuguese TV he said that a move to Benfica would be 'a good opportunity' if, as expected, Louis van Gaal decides to sell him.

On the move: Bebe, who has never started a Premier League match, wants to leave England this summer

Progress: Bebe was voted player of the season while on loan at Pacos de Ferreira last year

Impressed: Portuguese champion Benfica are interested in signing the Manchester United misfit

'I think it would be a good opportunity for me,' the striker told Antena 1.

'For now I will wait for my agent to resolve it. He will certainly know better than I do whether it's true or not.

'Of course it would be a great opportunity for me. Maybe I could play more and they could rely on me more. I think it would be a unique opportunity.'

Decision time: Louis van Gaal has made up his mind to get rid of Bebe this summer

Strange: The striker signed for United in 2010, despite Sir Alex Ferguson admitting he'd never watched him

Bebe was signed in a bizarre £7million deal in the summer of 2010 - despite Sir Alex Ferguson later admitting he had not seen the winger play.

He spent last season on loan at Pacos de Ferreira, where he scored 13 goals and was named player of the season.
