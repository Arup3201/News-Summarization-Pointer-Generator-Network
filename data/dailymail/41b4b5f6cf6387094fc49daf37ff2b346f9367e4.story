The traditional fillings for French eclairs are cream or confectioner’s custard — delicious. 

But would they be quite so appetising if they were filled with goat’s cheese, salmon mousse or caviar?

Harrods has created a range of savoury pastries for its food hall.

Harrods have launched a new range of pastries, with traditional eclair fillings swapped for products such as goat's cheese 

Another one of their new eclair features caviar, pictured, while another contains salmon mousse 

As well as goat’s cheese, balsamic vinegar and caramelised walnut eclairs (£5.95), there are smoked salmon millefeuilles made with layers of flaky pastry, anchovy, caviar and coriander.

If you’re not a big fan of pastries, there are savoury tiramisu-type desserts made with pumpkin and truffle, cauliflower and salmon, or pea and lobster mousses.

The piece de resistance is an extraordinary-looking salmon gateau decorated with caviar balls and cream cheese ‘icing’.

The offerings come at a time when stores attempt to lure customers with a range of unusual products. 

Reindeer carpaccio is to feature among the luxury delicacies being offered by budget supermarket Lidl this Christmas.

Packs of the thinly sliced raw meat will feature in the ‘Deluxe’ range that the thriving German chain hopes will draw in shoppers who would normally go to the other major retailers.

Lidl, who are also offering reindeer carpaccio as part of their luxury Deluxe range for Christmas 

Although the meat is mainly considered a Scandinavian delicacy, Lidl has had some success selling reindeer steaks in Britain, and believes consumers are now ready to eat the meat in its raw form.

It is one of 59 products being added to the budget chain’s upmarket range, taking the total number of luxury goods to 224.

The list also includes whole serrano hams at £39.99, gingerbread houses at £4.49, a whole lobster for £5.99, scallops at £3.99, champagne at £11.99 and Rioja Riserva at £5.99.
