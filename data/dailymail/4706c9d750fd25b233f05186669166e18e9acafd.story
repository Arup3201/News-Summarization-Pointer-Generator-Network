Corporal William Savage was one of three British soldiers killed instantly when their Mastiff 2 vehicle was destroyed by an IED on April 30, 2013

Three British soldiers were killed instantly when their armoured personnel carrier was destroyed after it struck an improvised explosive device (IED), their inquest has heard.

Corporal William Savage, 30, from Penicuick, Midlothian; Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, from Edinburgh; and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, from Edinburgh died after their  Mastiff 2 was destroyed on April 30, 2013.

Senior coroner for Oxfordshire Darren Salter, said the men were killed on Route 611 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district. 

A post-mortem on the three men concluded that they would have been deeply unconscious virtually instantly and virtually unaware of what had happened to them. 

Mr Salter said the Mastiff was designed to resist attacks from IEDs. 

The hearing heard that he trio, whe were all from B Company, 2nd Battalion, Scottish Regiment, were the first people to be killed inside the second evolution of the Mastiff since it was deployed in theatre in 2009. 

The inquest heard that the vehicle the three men died in had been damaged in another IED attack in May 2009. 

Despite the earlier damage and an ongoing problem with the locks on the rear of the vehicle, it had been declared battle-worthy shortly before the 

Mr Salter said he would consider the level of protection afforded by the Mastiff when subjected to such an attack; whether there were any defects with the vehicle on the morning it went out on patrol; whether it should have been possible to detect he IED before it exploded and whether there was any intelligence available before the attack.  

The Royal Military Police made inquiries to the Afghan National Police about this incident, but no one was arrested over it. 

The Mastiff, a protective patrol vehicle, had been from Forward Operating Base Ouellette to another base at Lashkar Gah Durai and was on its way back again when the attack happened.

It was one of four vehicles in the patrol.

The driver of the Mastiff, Fusilier Paul Howell, said in a statement that the regular locks to the rear doors had been faulty, and he had reported them twice.

He told the inquest that on the day in question, though they were stiff, they were fully sealed when closed.

The three men were the first to be killed in the Mastiff 2 vehicle, which had been first deployed on the battlefield in 2009. The men's inquest heard that the vehicle, pictured,  was designed to withstand IED attacks 

Extra battle locks were not deployed, but they were not supposed to be when the vehicle was in open desert, only when there were potential public order situations, he said.

He said in his statement that there were 20 ammunition tins under the seats in the rear, which was normal.

Shortly before the blast, two of the dead men had been singing a Dizzee Rascal song as they sat at the rear of the vehicle.

The three men were all flown to Camp Bastion followed the blast but they were all decalred dead shortly after arrival. 

The inquest heard that the dead men, were those who were sitting nearest the rear doors of the vehicle at the time of the explosion. They were travelling between Forward Operating Base Ouellette and Patrol Base Lashkar Gah Durai, when the bomb struck. 

The four-vehicle column had been told the night before the patrol that the road they were travelling was relatively quiet with normal civilian activity.

Blast survivor Fusilier Scott Bell told the hearing Fusilier Flint and Private Hetheringgton were singing the Dizzee Rascal song Baseline Junkie moments before the blast, which occurred some time in the late morning. 

Fusilier Bell said: 'I felt a really hard thud like I had been in a car crash. 

'There was a lot of dust everywhere.'

The soldier noticed Fusilier Flint was still in his seat, Private Hetherington was slouched forward and Corporal Savage, aged 30 years, appeared to be sitting up.

Fusillier Paul Howell, who was driving the Mastiff, said his 'mind went blank' for a while before waking up to see the front wheels blown off the vehicle.

He said: 'I noticed the back doors were open. It was then that I noticed I was in pain.'

Several other soldiers who were injured in the explosion recalled hazy memories of the incident.

Sergeant Saiasi Vono, who was in a Husky vehicle ahead of the Mastiff, said he saw a 'thick cloud of dust and smoke' behind them.

Sergeant Vono lead a team back to the damaged vehicle and climbed inside, calling to Corporal Savage, who did not respond.

The three fatally injured soldiers and their colleagues were pulled from the wreckage as the convoy waited for a helicopter to take them to hospital at Camp Bastion, where they were declared dead.

Post-mortem examinations revealed all three died from blast injuries caused by an explosion.

Two forensic pathologists who carried out the examinations said there was nothing that could have been done to save the men, who would all have been unaware of what happened.

The inquest continues and is expected to last a further two days.
