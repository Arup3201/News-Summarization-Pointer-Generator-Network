In recent years the search for life beyond our planet has focused on finding places with conditions that are ‘Earth-like’, so as to emulate our own planet, which we know can support life.

However, scientists have now proposed that some worlds might be able to host life ‘not as we know it’ that thrives not on water, but on other chemicals.

Specifically, they looked at Saturn’s moon Titan, which has seas of liquid methane rather than water, and they it could harbour methane-based, oxygen-free forms of life.

Cornell University scientists in New York have proposed a new type of life. Called an azotosome, it would survive on liquid methane rather than water - so it could live on Titan.

The fascinating research by scientists at Cornell University in New York suggests that life in the universe may be abundant in more places than thought.

The life they propose, called an azotosome, would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180°C (-292°F).

No life on Earth is known to be able to survive in similar conditions.

‘Ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it,’ said graduate student James Stevenson, first author of the research.

Life on our planet relies on a permeable water-based exterior - a vesicle or liposome - that houses the organic matter of every cell.

As no life on Earth can survive without water, astronomers have been looking for alien life in habitable zones of stars where liquid water can exist - it is not too hot, and not too cold.

But if cells could be based on methane, rather than water, they could survive in much colder climates, as methane has a much lower melting point.

A study in November 2014 argued that alien species could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as 'supercritical' carbon dioxide, rather than water.

This type of CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas.

Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees Kelvin (32°C) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 the standard atmosphere at sea level.

On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment, but astrobiologists at Washington State University believe it could also be capable of sustaining life.

Study co-author Professor Schulze-Makuch and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. 

The life proposed by the scientists would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180°C (-292°F). This means it could survive on the surface of Titan (illustration shown), meaning more worlds might be habitable than we thought

The theoretical azotosome life form is made from nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen molecules - all of which are known to exist in the cryogenic seas of Titan.

However, it shows the same stability and flexibility as comparable life on Earth.

And interestingly, to create the structures, the scientists also envision the cells could use a compound called acrylonitrile, which is a strong barrier to decomposition.

Acrylonitrile is a colourless, poisonous, liquid organic compound use in the manufacture of acrylic fibres and thermoplastics on Earth - and it is also present in Titan’s atmosphere.

Chemical Engineer Dr Paulette Clancy said the the next step is to try and demonstrate how these cells would behave in the methane environment.

This includes how they might reproduce and metabolise with their oxygen-free, methane-based cells.

It's the first proof for 'life not as we know it,’ said student James Stevenson
