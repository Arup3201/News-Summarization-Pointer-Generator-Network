There was talk of the San Siro just 24 hours earlier, Steve Bruce allowing himself to dream of leading out Hull City at the home of Inter Milan.

But it was opposite number Peter Maes talking of fairytale ties as he supped a Jupiler beer during his post-match reflections here in Lokeren.

For Bruce and his boys are certainly learning the hard way in Europe.

They were 10 minutes away from an embarrassing first-round exit against AS Trencin and now they must overturn a self-inflicted 1-0 reverse at the KC Stadium on Thursday if they are to reach the Europa League group stage.

Allan McGregor – who saved a penalty during Saturday’s 1-0 win at QPR - was one of only two players Bruce did not rest, but he was probably left wishing he had.

For it was the Scotland goalkeeper who blundered to gift victory to the unfancied Belgians.

Lokeren had hardly troubled McGregor until the soft concession which settled the match just before the hour mark.

The 32-year-old was far too casual in his attempt to play out of his area and Hans Vanaken seized upon his weak pass before rounding the forlorn keeper and slotting into the empty net.

And Bruce, who confirmed a bid for Blackburn’s Jordan Rhodes, said: ‘We’ve had our first lesson of what playing in Europe is about.

‘Concentration levels are paramount and we’ve made a mistake which cost us.

‘We had three of four wonderful opportunities to score late on but unfortunately missed them.

‘If you make a mistake like that, at this level, it’s an awful way to lose a match. McGregor was a hero on Saturday when he saved a penalty but he’s made a mistake which has cost us.’

Bruce has made no secret of his intention to prioritise domestic matters but nonetheless admits he would be ‘devastated’ to bow out before the group stage.

Yannick Sagbo is one of those who will be hoping to stake his claim for more pitch time in the wake of Shane Long’s sale but he did little to impress when hesitation cost him an early strike at goal on the edge of the six-yard area, defender Mijat Maric sliding to dispossess the dithering Ivorian. 

Sone Aluko was Hull’s hero in the last round against AS Trencin - his late goal sparing them the ignominy of an early exit - and he was unlucky to see a rising drive evade the target soon after.

Nill De Pauw went in search of a breakthrough shortly after the restart for the second half and his vicious blast from a narrow angle stung the palms of McGregor at his near post. That buoyed a vociferous home crowd and it was Lokeren who grew in confidence as the half wore on, Vanaken taking aim with a shot which slid wide moments later.

But the youngster made no mistake when he capitalised on McGregor’s howler to give the underdogs the lead on 58 minutes.

That seemed to spread anxiety through the Hull backline and their indecision presented Junior Dutra with a sight at goal for a second, the Brazilian blazing over from 12 yards when really he should have doubled the advantage.

Substitute Tom Ince did draw a save from Davino Verhulst when he wriggled free and slammed on goal, likewise Meyler as he fired towards the top corner five minutes from time only for the custodian to extend an arm and flip over the crossbar.

It leaves Bruce’s men a stiff task in six days’ time, and he added: ‘It will be difficult because we haven’t got an away goal. But we’ve got to try and win the game, it’s as simple as that.

‘It will be a different game in a week’s time and we have to win it.

‘We’ve got big games coming up and I have to think about that, but in hindsight I would pick the same team tonight.’

Maes, meanwhile, is dreaming of the San Siro.

‘Yes, I am thinking about that (potentially playing Inter Milan) because it is everybody,’ said the Lokeren manager. ‘We played with a very big heart. We are going to do everything to get to the group stage, but we’re still not favourites.’
