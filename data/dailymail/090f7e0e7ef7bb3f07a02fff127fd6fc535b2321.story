Barcelona star Neymar has fired an ominous warning to their rest of their domestic title rivals, by hailing that his forward triumvirate with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez will only get better.

The attacking trio were all on target as Luis Enrique's side swept past Athletic Bilbao 5-2 in La Liga on Sunday night.

Victory for the Catalan club away from home was also their ninth successive win in all competitions - in a display that saw Neymar, Messi and Suarez wonderfully combine.

Speaking after their success at the San Mames, Neymar admitted that there was still a long way to go in their season but acknowledged that a special partnership was brewing among the South American trio.

'I don't believe that we're unstoppable but we do a lot of work to help the team,' the 22-year-old told Canal Plus. 'I'm sure that we will win more and more, and will get better.

'We are going well but we need to keep doing the things we're doing. We're very happy because we are performing how we want to on the pitch right now.

'There are still many games left, though, and the season is long. But we're happy to be among the leaders.

'Now we only have to focus on what we're doing. We have to keep working on the pitch but what we did today was spectacular.'

Sunday's triumph saw second-placed Barcelona move within one point of league leaders, and eternal rivals, Real Madrid.
