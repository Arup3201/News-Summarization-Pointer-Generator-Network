Julie Roberts, who was hospitalised twice after being bitten by a spider leaving her unable to walk 

A mother-of-four has been hospitalised twice by a spider bite which left her unable to walk after developing a two-inch blister and needing antibiotics from a drip.

Julie Roberts says she was bitten by the spider at a friend’s barbecue in Hull, East Yorkshire after doctors told her an insect caused her injuries.

She spent three days in hospital receiving treatment before being discharged. 

But days later she had to be re-admitted for another three days as she continued to feel unwell.

And now she says she is suffering from anxiety and panic attacks due to her ordeal.

Ms Roberts said: 'At the moment I feel like a nervous wreck.

'I have been having panic attacks and freaking out – I was never like this before.

'All this has made me feel really poorly.

'I don’t know if I got bitten while I was there or when I got home, but when I woke up on the Sunday morning I noticed there was quite a big mark on my leg.

'By tea-time, a blister was forming and half of my leg was red.'

Ms Robert's ordeal began when she noticed the bite mark on her leg. 

She called the NHS 111 service for advice about the bite and was told to go to her nearest walk-in centre.

She was given antibiotics and told to go to hospital if her symptoms worsened.

After continuing to feel unwell, the 42-year-old then went to Hull Royal Infirmary, where she was admitted for three days and given antibiotics through a drip.

She explained: 'The doctors said that because the bite had blistered, they knew it was caused by a spider.

'I have been bitten by mosquitos before and never had a reaction like this, so it is obviously something in the spider’s bite.'

After her stay in hospital,she returned to her job as a secretary for a plumbing firm but four days later was forced to return to hospital for another three days after feeling worse than ever. 

After more treatment, she is now recovering at home and says she has become paranoid as she tries to keep her house free from insects.

Her foot also become swollen and she was put on a drip of antibiotics to bring down the swelling 

She added: 'I’ve become really paranoid. I always shake my clothes before I put them on to check there are no spiders hiding.

'My eldest daughter has cut all the garden down at the back of the house and I have vacuumed the house from top to bottom.

'We have also got some conkers to put in the house as I have heard that they stop them getting into homes.

'My friend’s husband got bitten by a spider and had a bad reaction.

'Apparently, there is a shop that sells items to stop spiders coming into your home, so I will be making a trip there when I feel up to it.'

After being bitten by the spider, Ms Roberts developed a two-inch blister on her foot, which left her unable to walk 

Experts say high temperatures during the summer has led to spiders growing bigger than ever.

This is because the warm weather means the spiders have had more to eat, and have not been killed off by falling temperatures.

Entomologist Barry Warrington explained: 'I have definitely seen a difference this year.

'The spiders are much larger and part of the reason for that is because of the good weather we have been having lately.

'Now, as the nights are drawing in, people will start to notice more spiders in their homes.

'The males, which are larger, will roam about looking for a female and this is when they are often encountered indoors, as well as looking for warmer places to hide.'
