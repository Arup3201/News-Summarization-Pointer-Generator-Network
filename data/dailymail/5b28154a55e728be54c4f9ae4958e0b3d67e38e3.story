It is seven days since the close of the summer transfer window and lots of exciting talent has arrived in the Premier League - and they have brought their gorgeous WAGs with them.

From Manchester United's £60million British-record signing Angel di Maria and his wife Jorgelina Cardoso to Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and his girlfriend Laia Grassi, there have been plenty of new additions of the Premier League WAG community.

Here, Sportsmail gives you a lowdown on a selection of the best new WAG arrivals...

Jorgelina Cardoso (Angel di Maria)

United's British-record signing Di Maria, who arrived from Real Madrid for £60m this summer, is married to the beautiful Jorgelina Cardoso.

Cardoso and Di Maria tied the knot in 2011 after dating for two years - but the 32-year-old is a feisty character, regularly defending her husband in public and in the media.

She is officially Di Maria's 'manager' and posts messages of encouragement to the Argentinian on her Instagram and Twitter.

Lorelei Taron (Radamel Falcao)

Falcao is earning a mouthwatering £280,000-a-week at Old Trafford - meaning he won't struggle to treat his 26-year-old wife Lorelei Taron to some nice birthday gifts.

Taron, who has been married to Falcao since 2007 after meeting him at church, is a talented singer who is well-known on the South American musical scene.

Laia Grassi (Alexis Sanchez)

Arsenal's £30million summer signing Sanchez brings with him 25-year-old girlfriend Laia Grassi.

The Spanish beauty is not necessarily your typical WAG, however, as she is an art director and a designer. But fear not, she still has the looks of a Premier League footballer's girlfriend...

The Spanish beauty is a student at Universidad Autonoma in Madrid and also works as a clerk at a clothes shop. She could follow Courtois to the English capital now it seems the Belgian will be staying put.

Moreno cried TWICE after announcing he would be leaving boyhood club Sevilla for Merseyside, but I am sure he found comfort in the arms of the beautiful Granadilla.
