Lazar Markovic scored his first league goal for Liverpool as the club prepared for the post-Gerrard era with a win that keeps alive their top-four hopes and leaves Sunderland staring at a relegation battle.

Steven Gerrard’s 25-year association with Anfield is not quite over yet, but this was the first match played since official confirmation that he will leave for MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of this season and, at 34, he will certainly not be playing every game until then. As if to underline his susceptibility, he was withdrawn at half-time yesterday as a precaution with a minor hamstring ailment.

Markovic, a 20-year-old Serb who cost £20million when bought from Benfica and various third parties last summer, was set up by a pass from Gerrard for the goal. The assist was symbolic as well as practical; it will be Markovic’s generation who will now be required to step up and fill the void about to be created not just by Gerrard’s technical contributions but his leadership.

Liverpool should have had a penalty before going ahead but referee Craig Pawson bafflingly failed to punish Wes Brown for bringing down Markovic. Liverpool later failed to punish 10-man Sunderland after Pawson gave a soft second yellow to Liam Bridcutt.

‘I thought we were outstanding in the first half,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He praised his team’s ‘control’ and ‘tempo’ and pressing game. ‘We should have had a clear penalty, we hit the crossbar and created other clear-cut chances,’ he said.

Liverpool have lost just one game now in their last 13 matches in all competitions and one in nine in the Premier League. This win leaves them in eighth place, four points behind the coveted Champions League slots. They will, however, need to up their game if they are to mount a realistic challenge.

Rodgers can at least look forward to returning players, with Daniel Sturridge getting closer after thigh and calf problems and Raheem Sterling due back from a mid-season holiday. Rodgers has given Sterling, 20, some time off to rest and the player has been soaking up some winter sun on holiday in Jamaica. He will be back next week.

‘In my two and a half years here, he has gone from youth team to full international,’ said Rodgers, explaining the rationale for Sterling’s break. ‘I need to think of the kid for himself and for Liverpool in the long term. It was a good time to give him a rest and he’ll be back fresh for the rest of the season.’

Rodgers also had praise for Markovic, who he insisted will have a ‘big, big future’.

Things look less bright for Sunderland, with just one win in 11 league games — and that not since the start of October against Stoke. 

This was the tenth league game of the season (out of 21) in which they have failed to score. ‘The feeling is not good,’ said manager Gus Poyet. 

‘We played poorly for 45 minutes of a very important game and, when you do that against a team like Liverpool, you’ll get punished.’

He then implied criticism of referee Pawson, agreeing that ‘by the rules’ yellow cards should be handed out for certain actions that inhibit attacking play. This was a reference to Bridcutt’s second booking, a soft card for the slightest contact with Emre Can.

Poyet then said that, by the rules, Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho should also have had two yellows. 

‘You referee by the rules or you referee by common sense,’ he said, implying Pawson had not used common sense.Poyet also confirmed he would try to buy a striker in the transfer window to address Sunderland’s chronic lack of goals. 

‘I’ll not give too much information away,’ he said. ‘We’ll try.’

Liverpool’s goal came after a decent phase of interplay ended with Markovic running on to a ball from Gerrard and slotting past Costel Pantilimon. Liverpool dominated for long periods of the first half, limiting a poor Sunderland to set-pieces and speculative long-range efforts.
