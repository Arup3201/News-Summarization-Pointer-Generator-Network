Earlier this year, the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson, pictured, implied there had been only one such payment

Health service bosses have spent £4million in just three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care.

A total of 133 doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out.

Yet earlier this year, the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson implied there had been only one such payment.

It followed revelations that Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, was given £500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients.

He was made to sign a back-door deal known as a judicial mediation arrangement. This meant the money he was given was never declared to the Treasury, which controls the NHS’s purse strings.

When Sir David was quizzed about the gagging order by MPs a few weeks later, he said: ‘It was the only one that I had ever come across.’

In March at a hearing of the Commons Health Select Committee, he added: ‘It is the first time in my experience I have ever seen that done.’

But figures obtained by Tory MP Steve Barclay sharply contradict his assertion. They show 41 such payments were made last year alone. Unlike normal gagging orders, these ‘secret’ orders do not have to be signed off by the Treasury. This meant the figures did not emerge  in previous revelations and the  public had no way of knowing that they exist.

However, Mr Barclay was able to obtain the data via a Parliamentary question to the Department  of Health.

Sir David is leaving his £211,000- a-year post as NHS chief executive next March having faced widespread criticism he failed to act over  the Mid Staffordshire scandal,  where hundreds of patients died from neglect.

He also stands accused of presiding over a culture of secrecy in which managers are encouraged to gag staff daring to speak out.

After becoming known as the ‘Man with No Shame’, he faced demands from MPs and medical professionals to leave immediately and forgo his £2million taxpayer-funded pension pot.

Mr Barclay said: ‘It appears David Nicholson either didn’t know about this failure within the NHS which led to it wasting millions of pounds even though he is the accountable officer for this money.

‘The other explanation is that he did know. If this is the case, he’ll need to write a letter to  Parliament explaining why he didn’t tell the truth.

A total of 266 doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out (posed by models)

‘It’s a patient safety issue first and foremost. You now have 133 fewer senior people flagging concerns that may have led to discussions and possibly more money to resolve the issues.’

The figures show that 77 NHS trusts, including hospitals and GP bodies, spent £3.9million on judicial mediation deals for 133 staff from 2009/10 to 2012/13.

But the Department of Health refused to disclose the size of the payments and would not name the trusts involved.

Judicial mediations are usually arranged when an employee has gone to a tribunal, for example claiming unfair dismissal. These figures do not include the more common gagging orders for staff who agree to leave quietly without taking legal action.

Separate data shows that the health service spent £15million paying off 600 staff since 2009 in payments approved by the Treasury.

Senior consultants paid up to £72 an hour for working evenings and weekends

Dr Kim Holt, who raised concerns about the clinic which sent Baby P home, said: ‘From the top there is pressure to cut costs and meet targets.

‘The bullying comes from the top down.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told NHS trusts not to use gagging clauses but critics said bosses will find ways round this.
