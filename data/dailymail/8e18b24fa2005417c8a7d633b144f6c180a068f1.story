Mark Cavendish’s troubled season continued in Liverpool on Sunday as he collided with a car and crashed during the first stage of the Tour of Britain.

The Isle of Man sprinter recovered to finish third behind Marcel Kittel, and then went straight to hospital.

‘I was coming back and I was behind a car,’ said Cavendish, who was returning to the peloton after an early problem with his shoes. ‘Someone had to stop for a puncture, so the car slammed on its brakes and there was an island in the road. If I went right I would hit the island, so I went left and I whacked another car.

Sprint: Cavendish powered towards the line at the end of the race to try and finish as high as he could

‘I hit it with my left leg and I was down on the road. I immediately felt a lot of pain on my quadriceps.

‘I don’t know what’s wrong but it’s f*****. That’s why I’m off to hospital.’ That Cavendish was able to contest the final sprint at all was a surprise.

Still battling back to full fitness after suffering ligament damage when he crashed at the Tour de France, his woes continued here with his shoe problem, his crash and a compromised sprint.

Cavendish said: ‘I wasn’t planning to sprint, it was painful. But after a couple of laps we decided to just try anyway, but to sprint seated because I was in pain. I still got third, but it’s a shame because I really wanted to win in front of the British public.

‘Accidents like this are a part of cycling and it’s just a matter of bad luck. I really hope that my luck turns in the next days.’

There was another crash in the final kilometre, which Cavendish avoided, but he could do nothing against Kittel, the Giant-Shimano sprinter who, for the second year in a row, won four stages at the Tour de France.

Kittel won in Harrogate and London when the Tour was in England, having also won the first stage of the Giro d’Italia in Belfast. Liverpool was billed as a re-match with Cavendish, who was at fault when he crashed in Harrogate, but the German’s dominance continued. He remains unbeaten against Cavendish in head-to-head sprints.

The opening day of the eight-stage race, which finishes in London on Sunday, was bathed in sunshine as the riders tackled eight laps of a flat 13.1km circuit around Liverpool.

Sir Bradley Wiggins appeared on the front on the final lap, keeping the pace high for his Sky team-mate Ben Swift, who finished fifth. Wiggins, the defending champion, said this could be the last time he starts a stage race aiming to win.

‘When I was at the Tour of California earlier this year I said I would never go for it again, but then I thought I would like one more crack at this one,’ said Wiggins. ‘The plan is to put on some weight and I will be training for the track, so stage racing to win the GC (general classification) will be out the window after this.

‘I will definitely be racing to win but whether I can is another matter. If I can just stay close to the big GC guys on Tuesday I can be competitive.’
