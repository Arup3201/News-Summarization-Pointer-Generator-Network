If anyone has ever wished to dine with the Romney family, this is probably the closest you'll get. The wife of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has written a cookbook full of recipes her family loves to eat.

'The Romney Family Table' promises recipes such as Ann's Welsh skillet cookies (the same ones she handed out to reporters during Mitt Romney's unsuccessful 2012 Presidential campaign), 'Mitt's Meatloaf Cakes' and homemade ice-cream.

The book's focus on hearty and traditional recipes puts it in contrast with the efforts of the First Lady, Michelle Obama.

The cookbook of Mormon: Former aspiring First Lady Ann Romney's cookbook contains recipes her family loves to eat, anecdotes about the family and cooking hints and tips

Obama's book, 'American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America' promotes healthy eating, and documents the growth of the kitchen garden she established at the White House.

The book has a wide scope, taking in recipes, community gardens across the U.S., instructions for composting and historical information about First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's Victory Garden and Thomas Jefferson's attempts to grow a four-foot long cucumber.

The two have faced-off in the kitchen 
before, in the Family Circle Cookie Contest in last year. Michelle 
Obama's white and dark chocolate chip cookies edged out Ann Romney's 
M&M cookies by several hundred votes.

Publisher of Ann Romney's book Shadow Mountain, an imprint of the Mormon publisher Deseret, says Ann 'invites readers into her home and kitchen, combining some of her favorite foods with memories of raising a family. In 'The Romney Family Table', Ann shares a unique blend of heartwarming (and often humorous) stories, homegrown traditions, and hearty recipes that have brought her family together for more than forty years.'

Ann says that for her, cooking is 'part of the most important occupation on earthâ€”raising a family.'

With a husband, five children and 21 grandchildren, Ann has previously said she used to feel like a short-order cook, and when her last son left home she told her husband, 'You just ate your last home-cooked meal!'

In her book, Ann shares 'some of the tips that have helped her along the way'.

Busy: Since her husband's Presidential run, Ann Romney has been working on her cookbook, and the couple visited Book Expo America on Friday to promote the book

The nation has always had a fascination with the eating habits of political leaders, and the cooking skills of their wives.

In 1952, it was Mamie Eisenhower's no-cook 'Million Dollar Fudge', made with Marshmallow Fluff. In the 1980s, it was Nancy Reagan's Monkey Bread. Allegedly, Martha Washington's crab soup remains a favorite in the White House. And let's not forget the Presidential Peanut Butter and Honey Sandwich - a favorite of George W Bush.

The Romney Family Table hits shelves on October 1.
