British Gas today reported a 30 per cent slide in profits to £522million in the past year - despite putting up bills by a quarter since 2010.

The energy giant claimed mild a spring and autumn had led to a drop in household gas consumption by more than a fifth and a 4 per cent cut in electricity use.

But research by a consumer group showed the main reason people had gone without heating was the massive cost of energy, rather than the weather.

Expensive: British Gas today reported a 30 per cent slide in profits - despite hiking gas prices by more than a quarter in recent years

British Gas hiked its prices in December 2010 and again in August 2011 by 24.9 per cent or £256 in total, pushing its average household bill up to £1,286 a year.

It has since cut its electricity price by 5 per cent or £26, after losing 97,000 customers over the course of 2011.

Despite the fall in profits by a nearly a third in its household energy arm, parent company Centrica still reported a 1 per cent increase in operating profits to £2.41billion.

The company's upstream gas and oil 
exploration business saw profits jump 33 per cent, thanks to higher 
wholesale gas prices on world markets and good production performance.

Elsewhere,
the fall in profits was clawed back through residential services such 
as boiler repairs, where profits were 10 per cent higher at £264million.

Annual bill sizes based on a medium user profile on a standard plan.

Customers using 3,300kWh and 16,500kWh gas, paying on receipt of bill with bill sizes averaged across all regions.

Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'People will be shocked that when millions of families are struggling with their energy bills, big energy companies like British Gas are enjoying huge profits.

'By letting the energy giants get away with this, the Government is showing it's out of touch and completely unable to stand up to powerful vested interests in the energy industry.

'Our energy market needs a complete overhaul, but David Cameron can only fiddle at the margins because he's too close to vested interests to stand up for working people.'

British Gas blamed lower household energy consumption on milder winter weather, but other research indicated that hard-pressed consumers were willing to brave the cold rather to keep bills down.

Centrica shares closed at 293.5p on the London Stock Exchange yesterday, valuing the business at £15.2billion.

Adam Scorer, director of policy and external affairs at Consumer Focus, said the results showed that the energy industry is close to recession-proof.

'Healthy profits are still being made despite a big dip in consumption over our mild winter this year.'

He added that consumers needed to be assured that the price they pay is continually fair, and that the competitive energy market is working in their interests.

'British Gas happens to be the most 
open of all the big six firms. But as long as the market is not felt to 
be fully transparent, consumers will continue to question every price 
rise, every profit statement and every explanation as to why bills are 
so high.'

According to a survey from 
uSwitch.com, 71 per cent cited the high cost of energy as the main 
reason they have gone without heating this winter, compared to just 
under a quarter who said weather was the main reason.

British Gas claims it has invested £1.80 for every £1 it has earned over 
the past five years. Its dividend for shareholders increased 8 per cent 
to 15.4p a share.

Chief 
executive Sam Laidlaw said it had been a tough year, 'both for Centrica 
and our customers', but that the company was still making the 
investments 'on which Britain's energy future depends'.

However, Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com, said: 'The important thing here is that the drop in residential profits is more than offset by an increase in profits at the wholesale end of the business.

'Against this background I suspect that many of its customers will  be even more disappointed that while their bills soared by £256 or 24.9 per cent as a result of two price hikes, the supplier has subsequently cut just its electricity price by £26 or 5 per cent.

'Affordability is already a huge concern and while British Gas has pointed to the mild winter weather as the reason why household consumption has fallen, our own research shows that people are turning down and switching off because of cost.

'Seven in ten (71 per cent) say that the main reason they have gone without heating this year is the high cost of energy rather than the mild weather (24 per cent) – this fact speaks for itself.

'I would urge all suppliers to acknowledge the pressure their customers are under and to cut their prices again. As Britain’s biggest supplier it would be great to see British Gas take the lead.'

The 'Big Six' energy companies have faced continual accusations of profiteering as prices have pushed higher and higher.

Regulator Ofgem last year appointed BDO, a firm of forensic accountants, to investigate accounting practices amid claims energy companies could be attempting to make their retail divisions appear less profitable.

Last month BDO reported that the companies' accounting methodologies were broadly fair and appropriate.
