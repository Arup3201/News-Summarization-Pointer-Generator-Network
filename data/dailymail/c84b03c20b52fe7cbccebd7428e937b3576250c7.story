A new fossil may force anthropologists to rewrite the evolutionary history of how our early ancestors first began walking upright on two legs.

For decades scientists have believed that our upright posture evolved in a common ancestor shared with the great apes including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans around 15 million years ago.

This led to the broad torsos and mobile forelimbs that appear all great apes - known as the orthograde body plan.

But a 12.3 million year old fossilised hipbone belonging a prehistoric ape named Sivapithecus indicus discovered in modern Pakistan, is challenging this belief. 

The hip bone (pictured) of an early ape ancestor called Sivapithecus indicus may lead to the evolutionary tree of apes and humans being rewritten as it suggests apes evolved to walk upright more than once in the past

This species was thought to be an ancient relative of the orangutan that emerged after the great apes split from the gibbons and lived around 12 million to 10 million years ago

Fossilised skull fragments have suggested it had the facial features similar to modern orangutans and scientists assumed it would also have an ape-like body plan.

British biologist Sir Alister Hardy was among the first scientists to propose that humans are descended from aquatic apes.

He wrote that apes came down from the trees to live in the food rich creeks, river and seas.

He said they evolved to become upright as they tried to keep their heads above water, and lost their hair. They developed fat to keep warm in the water. 

Some scientists propose that humans evolved large sinuses principally to help make our heads more buoyant and keep them above water. 

But other anthropologists say there is little evidence to support the idea that our ape ancestors spend millions of years evolving in a watery environment.

They argue that predators like crocodiles, which have been on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs, would have made rivers, lakes and swamps dangerous places.  

However, the new hipbone has revealed that these creatures had a narrow torso that more resembles those of monkeys.

This suggests that Sivapithecus may have had both ape-like and monkey-like features, and has left researchers baffled about how it fits into the evolutionary tree.

If it is indeed an ancestor of the orangutan, then it could mean that the upright ape-like body plan evolved at least twice in the past - once in orangutans and once in other great apes.

Dr Michele Morgan, cruator of osteology and paleoanthropology at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, said: 'We always thought if we found this body part, that it would show some of the features we find in the living great apes.

'To find something like this was surprising.

'Today, all the living great apes—gorillas, orangutans, chimps—have very broad torsos.

'People had commonly thought that this torso shape was shared among all the great apes, meaning it must have evolved in a common ancestor.

'We initially believed that Sivapithecus was on the orangutan line, but if that is the case, then the great ape body shape would have had to evolve at least twice.'

Skull fragments of Sivaptihecus indicus (above) suggest it had facial features similar to modern orangutans

Scientsts believe Sivapithecus would have moved through the trees in ancient forests like a monkey on all four limbs but would have often used branches to support its weight much like an orangutan, pictured above

The researchers, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, used the new hipbone fossil along with other pieces of fossilised skeleton discovered in the past to reconstruct how Sivapithecus may have moved.

The believe that it was probably a slow-moving and deliberate creature that lived in the trees.

They say it may have moved on all fours above supports but perhaps frequently used branches to help support its body in much the same way as modern orangutans do.

There are a number of competing theories for how our ape ancestors first began walking on two legs.

Some biologists believe it was a natural progression as ancient species of ape began using branches to help support their weight.

Others say they used water to help support their weight as they began foraging for food in rivers and pools in the forests, much like gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees still do today.

This bonobos, a relative of the chimpanzee, wading through water on two legs using a branch as a walking stick. Some scientists believe this may have been how upright walking first appeared in ape ancestors

However, Dr Lawrence Flynn, assistant director of the American School of Prehistoric Research at the Peabody Museum who was also involved in the research, said that the latest findings suggest that the evolutionary tree of the great apes was probably far more complicated than previously believed.

He said: 'I think we sometimes take the easy route of trying to understand these fossils based on creatures we find today.

'What we're finding out time and again is these 10- or 12- or 15-million-year-old creatures were their own entities. Today is not always a very good model for the past.

'What this speaks to is a rich tree with a lot of branches. There are not just one or two branches that reach back into the Miocene. It's a very rich and complex tree.'

The fossil is from an ancestor of the orangutan called Sivapithecus indicus

This early ape lived in what is now Pakistan around 12.3 million years ago 

@highlight

Scientists believed a common ape ancestor was the first to walk upright

@highlight

All apes - gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans - have the same body plan 

@highlight

The new fossil shows Sivaptihecus had a body more similar to a monkey

@highlight

This suggests that the upright ape body plan may have evolved twice
