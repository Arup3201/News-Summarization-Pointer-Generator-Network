The outspoken teenage sister of Bristol Palin’s ex-fiancé certainly has an agenda to dish up dirt on the family that she claims ‘screwed up’ hers.

But revelations made by Mercede Johnston, 19, are still just as stinging after she claimed Bristol, 20, has had up to five plastic surgeries.

Mercede, whose brother Levi Johnston, 21, was twice engaged to Bristol, also alleged the young woman's brother Track Palin, 22, was a drug user.

‘She's had numerous surgeries on her face, her chin twice or three times,’ Mercede told Playboy magazine, in which she stripped off for nude photos.

‘Before Tripp was born she had liposuction here and liposuction elsewhere - I'm not supposed to say (where) because Levi made me promise.

‘And she had something else done after Tripp was born.’

Bristol has admitted she had plastic surgery on her face to make it thinner with higher cheekbones and a newly-defined chin and jawline.

But she told Us Magazine in May that she
 only had the facial overhaul so her jaw and teeth could properly 
realign after an overbite.

However the Gawker blog said if she had had five surgeries ‘she'd have spent the last three years in perpetual recovery’, so Mercede's suggestion seems doubtful.

Mercede also claimed Bristol never wanted to get back with Levi in 2010 when they got re-engaged and it was only to ‘control' him.

She alleged Bristol would ‘use sex to get her way on many things’ with Levi and told him: ‘I prayed to God you weren't the father’ of her son.

‘Everything is about her, her, her,’ 
Mercede told Playboy. 'She has to have her own way (and) doesn't think 
anything she could do or does is wrong.’

Mercede
 has a tattoo of Levi on her wrist because of the ‘bond’ she has with 
him and it was revealed on the Tyra Banks show in 2009.

Bristol was criticised and ridiculed during 'Dancing with the Stars' for being one of the only contestants to not lose weight on the TV show.

She claimed Track would take ‘OxyContin and mostly cocaine’ and he was sent to the Army by his mother to avoid him ruining her reputation.

No go: Mercede's brother Levi Johnston was twice engaged to Bristol

This is not the first time an allegation
 has been made of Track having a drug problem, as the National Enquirer made similar 
claims in 2008.

‘I think (Sarah Palin) would have had a mental breakdown is she was elected (president). As governor she quit on us. Is she prepared to govern the whole country? Absolutely not'

Mercede and Levi's mother, Sherry Johnston, was convicted in 2009 of dealing OxyContin and jailed for three years.

The
 teenager said it is hard for her to get a job because potential 
employees say: ‘We love the Palins, so we're not going to hire her.’

Mercede, also known as ‘Sadie’ to friends, claimed former Alaska governor Sarah Palin used Levi as a ‘prop’ as she ran for vice-president in 2008.

‘I think she’d have had a mental breakdown is she was elected (president),’ Mercede told Playboy. ‘As governor she quit on us.

‘Is she prepared to govern the whole country? Absolutely not.’

Mrs Palin has just become a grandmother for the second time after Track's new wife Britta had a baby girl, Kyla Grace, following their marriage in May.

Sarah Palin’s office and two representatives for Bristol have not yet responded to a request for comment by MailOnline on the allegations.
