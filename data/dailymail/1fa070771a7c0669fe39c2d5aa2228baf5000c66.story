The ‘French Kim Kardashian’ was released from prison under strict bail conditions today  as she awaits trial for allegedly trying to murder her boyfriend with a kitchen knife. 

Reality TV beauty Nabilla Benattia, 22, will not be allowed to contact Thomas Vergara, 28, whom she is said to have attacked at an apartment hotel in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, five weeks ago. 

She has emphatically denied being ‘consumed by jealousy and sexual aggression’ as she allegedly plunged the knife into her lover’s chest.

Fame: Reality TV beauty Nabilla Benattia, 22, will not be allowed to contact Thomas Vergara, 28, whom she is said to have attacked at an apartment hotel in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, five weeks ago

From stardom to solitary: The pair's romance was played out entirely on TV after she was awarded her own show following her appearance on 'The Reality-TV Angels' show in France last year (left, Benattia pictured by police after her arrest)

Vergara, who met Benattia on a reality TV show, was found lying in a pool of blood when emergency workers burst into their hotel room at 2.30am on November 7th. 

Benattia had made a frantic call to the police, saying Thomas had been attacked by three strangers when they got out of a taxi outside the hotel. 

But CCTV footage soon exposed her story as a farce – film instead showed the couple arriving in reception alone and in good spirits, then making their way up to their apartment. 

Benattia then claimed Thomas was high on cocaine and alcohol, and had ‘accidently stabbed himself’ during a violent quarrel.

Overcome: Benattia bursts into tears after the surprise visit. She has said that her ambition in life is to become an It girl in the United States

Interviewed by an examining magistrate, Benattia then offered a third version of the drama – saying she was ‘in fear of [her] life’ when Thomas started hitting her. 

Benattia again told the judge that Thomas ‘stabbed himself’ in the confusion, as she desperately tried to get away. 

Martin Desrues, her lawyer, said: ‘The only version by Miss Benattia is the one that is listed on the record, the only one she delivered to the police while in custody.  

Passion: The model-turned-TV star has admitted that her relationship with Thomas was tumultuous with 'fights', 'vases being thrown' and hotel breakages

Defence: Benattia has variously claimed that Thomas was attacked by a group of men and also that he accidentally stabbed himself during the argument at the hotel, above

‘The first comments reported in the media have no value. They were only vaguely reported by people on the spot.’ 

Mr Derues said that Benettia hoped to carry on with her work commitments, while not commenting on her attempted murder case.  

She is forbidden from leaving France or contacting Vergara, even via social media accounts such as Twitter, where she has more than a million followers.

Benattia was considered a vulnerable prisoner in Versailles women’s prison, where there were fears of attacks by other inmates because of her fame.

Suspicions: Thomas checked himself into hospital with an unexplained knife wound to the back in August, telling doctors he had 'fallen on a kitchen knife' while with Nabilla

Dark past: As a teenager in 2009, Benattia was sentenced to six months in prison in Switzerland for her part in a financial fraud involving stolen passports, and served a month in a youth detention centre

Benattia’s first big break was on ‘Les Anges de la telerealite’ (‘The Reality-TV Angels’) last year. 

A number of French wannabes were placed in a Florida apartment, all dreaming of finding stardom. 

Highlights included a meeting with Kim Kardashian, and then Benattia was given her own show, Allo Nabilla, which was broadcast from glamorous locations including Los Angeles and Paris. 

The central storyline of the show is Benattia and Vergara’s relationship, which started when they both met on The Angels.
