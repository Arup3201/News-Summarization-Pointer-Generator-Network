They have had a rocky relationship since the start.

But in December things came to an ugly head as exes Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler - who have two children together - were both arrested in Los Angeles for threatening to kill each other, TMZ reported.

This run-in with the law only came to light on Friday when legal papers surfaced.

Not a good way to enjoy the holidays: Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler were both arrested in early December for threatening to kill each other, according to a Friday report from TMZ; here they are seen in 2005

Travis and Shanna - who were married from 2004 to 2008 - were 'handcuffed and thrown in the back of squad cars for making criminal threats against each other on December 7,' the site claimed.

First the singer threatened to kill her then the blonde model did the same back, it was alleged. They are both 39-years-old.

TMZ claimed Barker of Blink- 182 'got in a verbal fight over a reality show Travis wants to do with their two kids.'

The family already starred together in the reality show Meet The Barkers from 2005 to 2006.

The site, which has seen the arrest documents, said the musician was quoted as saying, 'If I could, I'd put a bullet in your head.'

Moakler called police that came to their LA home, it was added.

After fighting some more in front of the officers, they were handcuffed and 'taken to the station,' the site noted.

The former Playboy model said that they have not been getting along and he regularly calls her a 'b****.'

He spends a lot of time with their kids: The Blink - 182 singer with  daughter Alabama Luella  (L front), son Landon Asher (R front) and Shanna's daughter with her ex, boxer Oscar de la Hoya, Atiana Cecilia at Nickelodeon's  Kids' Choice Awards in March

She maintained that he also called her 'a "f***ing piece of garbage' and has said she is 'a cigarette smoking, coke-snorting bitch."

The former beauty queen also has an email in which he said, 'My poor kids have a wh*** for a mom.'

Sources told TMZ charges will not be filed against either one but The LA County Department Of Children And Family Services 'was contacted and they are investigating,' TMZ added. 

Together they have daughter Alabama Luella and son Landon Asher.

Shanna also has a daughter with her ex, boxer Oscar de la Hoya. Her name is Atiana Cecilia. 

On Thursday the former reality star posted a sultry selfie to Instgram with the caption, 'Bored so I've been playing with make up.'

On Wednesday she shared a note about surviving using 'courage, humor and grace.'
