Paula Stevenson, seen here with a picture of her baby girl Hayley, describe her daughter's treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital as 'brutal'

The family of a baby girl who died after doctors ignored their pleas to help her said they had been treated with ‘utter contempt’, an inquest heard yesterday.

Hayley Fullerton died of a massive heart attack after she was treated at Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

During her care, the one-year-old twice suffered a collapsed lung after doctors mistakenly inserted a breathing tube too far down her throat.

Her family say she experienced ‘brutal’ treatment at the hands of some NHS staff and have accused the hospital of ‘abominable’ failings in her care.

Yesterday they told her inquest how her cardiologist had ‘barked’ and ‘glared’ at them after they raised questions over the dying baby’s care.

And the family say doctors ignored their pleas to move her into intensive care – something medics now admit could have saved her life.

The inquest heard that Hayley was born with a blockage which meant blood could not get from her heart to her lungs. She was operated on at one hospital, and then sent to Birmingham for heart surgery in October 2009.

The operation was a success, but complications arose when staff inserted a tube into her lung incorrectly, causing it to collapse.

After being told Hayley’s right lung had collapsed, her grandmother Sylvia Stevenson, who has since died, asked paediatric cardiologist Dr Oliver Stumper what treatment she could be given.

Her husband Edward Stevenson told the coroner that Dr Stumper had ‘glared’ at his wife and ‘gave her a look of utter contempt’, before telling her Hayley would have to wait until the following day.

Hayley Fullerton was born with a hole in her heart, and had to undergo surgery aged 10-months-old to correct it

It was during the recovery from the surgery when complications arose, ultimately leading to her tragic death

In a statement written before her 
death, Mrs Stevenson said: ‘My daughter said I looked like a parent in a
third world country begging for my child’s life.’

Forty-eight hours later Hayley died after both her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest.

At the inquest yesterday, her mother Paula Stevenson said: ‘I could not believe that Hayley had just been left to deteriorate.

‘All along the family had expressed 
their concerns about Hayley’s breathing and had even asked if there was a
problem with her lungs, yet nothing was done. I do not understand how 
things were left to get so bad.’

Dr Stumper, who has worked at 
Birmingham Children’s Hospital since 1993, told the inquest he should 
have provided the treatment sooner. The doctor said Hayley had been 
‘doing pretty fine’ until she suffered an ‘acute sudden collapse’ on the
morning of November 11, when both lungs collapsed and she went into 
cardiac arrest.

Paula Stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital

‘I think we provided therapy by and 
large at the right time,’ he said. ‘I express my frustration and apology
that we failed, that I failed, to request physiotherapy on the evening 
of November 9. Having said that, she did improve after she received 
physiotherapy on November 10.’

On Monday Miss Stevenson, 40, told how
she was so desperate for nurses to pay more attention to her daughter 
that she offered one a £100 bribe to ‘look after’ her.

Miss Stevenson, who now lives with 
Hayley’s father Bobby Fullerton and their second daughter Casey in 
Australia, also told how she ‘begged’ medics to put Hayley back into an 
intensive care unit after her lung collapsed.

Yesterday consultant paediatrician 
Adrian Plunkett admitted that might have saved her life. But he added: 
‘I have doubts as to whether she would have survived long term.’

The inquest continues.
