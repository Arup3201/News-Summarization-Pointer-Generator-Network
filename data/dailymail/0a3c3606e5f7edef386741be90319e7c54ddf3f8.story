A deadly 10ft shark usually found in the Caribbean has been found washed up on a picturesque beach in north Wales.

The dead Mako shark was discovered on Friday by fishermen on Barmouth Beach, on the edge of Snowdonia park, leading families and young children to gather round the animal.

Mako sharks, which attack by lunging up from deep water to rip chunks of flesh from their prey, killed three people between 1980 and 2010.

Children and parents were seen touching the deadly predator after it was found on the beach 20 miles north of Aberystwyth

Gwion Liggett, was one of the first to see the shark after it washed up on the popular holiday beach, with word soon spreading throughout the coastal hamlet.

He said: 'When I arrived at the beach around sunset there was a huge crowd gathering around it.

'I was surprised it wasn't just a fisherman's tale.

'I was taken aback not just by how long it was but also how wide - it is a serious shark.'

Mako sharks are the fastest shark in the world and normally feed on squid and fish such as mackerel, tuna and swordfish.

They are a threatened species and are usually found in tropical waters between California and Chile, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.

There were 42 recorded Mako shark attacks on humans over 30 years, with three people killed as well as 20 boat attacks.

An average Mako will grow up to 10ft in length, swim in excess of 30mph and can weigh up to 21stone.

'It has got that feeling of Jaws and Amity Island,' Mr Liggett, who has taken his partner and primary school age children to see the predator, said.

'A lot of people will be hesitant to get back in the water after this. Maybe it is fortunate it has happened at this time of year so people can have some time to get over it.

'If it had happened in summer then I think a lot less people and holidaymakers would be in the water. 

'I overheard some local kids talking about becoming Marine Biologists after seeing this creature. A huge shark on the beach is big news in little Barmouth.'

The shark is still lying on the beach and no one has come to collect it despite the Harbour Master letting the relevant authorities know about it.

Trophy hunters have been pulling razor-sharp teeth from the dead shark since it was found on Friday.
