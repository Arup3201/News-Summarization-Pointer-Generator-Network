Revered culinary tradition: A bakery in southern France is selling stale, one-day old baguettes to cash-strapped customers

A bakery in southern France has broken with one of the nation’s most revered culinary traditions - by selling stale, one-day old baguettes.

Cash-strapped customers can buy the tough, date-expired loaves for half the price of fresh bread at the shop in the city of Nimes.

Staff then advise people to ‘run the bread under the tap’ before re-baking it for two minutes in the oven to make it more edible.

The baguette is a prized symbol of French identity, and is considered spoiled the day after it has been made.

But
the popularity of the cut-price deal at the Au Pain de la Veille bakery
- meaning 'Yesterday’s Bread’ - is the latest sign of the dwindling 
spending power of many French families.

One
pensioner told France 24 television she had a baguette, a flan and a 
cheese-filled loaf from the store for €4 - about £3.40 - half the normal
price.

She told the TV channel: 'They bake up so well you can hardly tell the difference.'

The shop has a chain of five fresh bakeries in Nimes, and sends all its unsold stock to its new discount bread outlet.

A sales assistant there said: 'One-day old baguette is considered the anti-Christ of bread by many French people.

'But
the financial crisis has hit us so hard that our goods are proving very
popular with many of the less well-off in this city.'

The bakery doesn't just sell bread but also pizzas, cakes and pastries.

The town of Nimes is one of the worst-hit cities by the country's financial crisis, suffering one of the country’s highest unemployment rates.

Nimes, one of the oldest cities in Europe, is named after the Roman God Nemausus, and is becoming increasingly popular as a weekend destination.
