When biting, diving, brilliant Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona, the Premier League had a vacancy for a bad-boy striker to be revered and detested in equal measures. After a successful six-month probation period, you can safely say Diego Costa has landed himself the job.

Chelsea's centre forward has been the single-most newsworthy player of the season. Just like Suarez, and Eric Cantona before him, sports editors can rely on at least 50 back-page splash stories a season from Costa.

Chelsea's 1-0 win against Liverpool on Tuesday night to book a place in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley was virtually a footnote alongside the Diego Costa show.

Diego Costa is forging a reputation as the Premier League's most explosive striker since Luis Suarez (right)

Costa has been deadly in front of goal since his move to Chelsea, as this strike against Swansea showed

Suarez was also a lethal finisher at Liverpool, with this long-range volley against Norwich a highlight 

Costa showed his dark side with this stamp on Martin Skrtel, for which he was somehow not sent off

Suarez was never far away from controversy, and he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield in April 2013

He trod on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel – Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers broke off usual diplomatic protocol to use the term 'stamp' to describe the challenge on Can - failed to win a certain penalty because of his reputation for diving, and was regularly taunted by Liverpool fans.

In terms of having the emotions stirred, it was like having Suarez back. Everything Costa does is tinged with controversy, and of course he can play too.

Jose Mourinho won't care, of course. He bought Costa from Atletico Madrid not for his silky technical skills but for his goalscoring ability and refusal to back away from a fight.

Born in Brazil and honed in Spain, Costa has strength and power, and uses it. He ignored the common consensus that it takes time for outsiders to adjust to the Premier League and banged in seven goals in his first four games, leaving Mourinho to make favourable comparisons with Didier Drogba, a genuine club legend. 

Costa also appeared to stamp on Emre Can's right leg during Tuesday's feisty Capital One Cup semi-final

Costa is never one to back down from a fight, and he clashed with Can after the incident at Stamford Bridge

Costa and Skrtel also squared up after the other stamp incident against Liverpool

Costa was unlucky not to win a penalty, however, when Skrtel clearly tripped him in the area

Costa also appeared to grab Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's throat in yet another violent incident

He irritates opponents in a way Suarez used to. The Uruguayan thought nothing of diving, handling, biting, snarling at officials or abusing opponents in order to win. 

Costa arrived in England with a reputation. Atletico Madrid fans loved him for clashing with Xabi Alonso, Pepe and Sergio Ramos in a Madrid derby. It was harder to excuse a headbutt on a Viktoria Plzen player that got him a red card in the Champions League.

But he arrived with pedigree too. His goals fired Atletico to the La Liga title and a Champions League final last season. The price tag of £32million certainly wasn't cheap but Manchester City paid around the same for Eliaquim Mangala, so it wasn't extortionate either.

In only his third game, Costa showed he is different. Following a hard-fought tussle with Seamus Coleman, the Everton defender scored an own goal, and Costa felt obliged to give him an earful about it. Everton weren't happy, Chelsea fans loved it. Their man had been the subject of some rough treatment and was getting revenge.

Since then, he's hardly been out of the news. Against Swansea City, Costa scored a hat-trick and lashed out at Gylfi Sigurdsson. Frustrated by Sunderland, he caught Wes Brown with a flailing arm and picked up a fifth booking that got him suspended. He was booked against Hull City for simulation. He's argued with countless defenders including Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta.

Suarez was not afraid to cheat to win, as this clear handball before scoring against Mansfield in 2013 showed

He was also not shy of diving, such as when he tumbled over Brad Guzan to win a penalty in January last year

But he is no Joey Barton, Robbie Savage or Vinnie Jones, who deal exclusively in controversy. Like Suarez, Costa is among the best players in the Premier League and should Chelsea go on to win the title he will be a leading contender for Footballer of the Year.

When someone is that good, you can get away with plenty. Costa has scored 17 goals in 19 Premier League games and at the age of 26 is just about to enter his prime. Drogba was 26 when he first signed for Chelsea and got better with age.

No wonder Mourinho is prepared to defend his star man. The FA are looking to clamp down on stamping incidents, but he has already ruled that Costa's contact with Can was 'accidental'. Asked if the player's aggressive nature could be a problem, Mourinho snapped back: 'I don't agree'.

We feared the Premier League would be a duller place without Suarez. With Costa around, the vacuum has been filled. The next headline can't be far away.
