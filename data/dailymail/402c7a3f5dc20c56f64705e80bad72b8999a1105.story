A 45-storey slum which featured in the hit U.S. television series Homeland is being cleared by soldiers – after becoming notorious around the world.

Thought to be the world’s tallest slum, the ‘Tower of David’ skyscraper has been home to thousands of Venezuelans in the capital city of Caracas over the years.

But soldiers and officials have started a mass-eviction of the half-built tower, which once appeared in the third series of Homeland, starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes.

The giant Tower of David has been home to thousands of Venezuelans over the years, but politicians say it is unsafe

The tower was depicted in Homeland as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity. Pictured is a scene from series three episode three of the show

The building has become notorious for drugs and crime while politicians say it has become unsafe with children having fallen to their death.

During the week, hundreds of families will be ‘peacefully’ moved out of the building, which was originally intended to be a bank centre. It was abandoned in 1994 and later became home to thousands of squatters.

Residents are going to new homes in the town of Cua, south of Caracas, under the state's Great Housing Mission project - a flagship policy of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.

Nicknamed after its developer, the financier and horse-breeder David Brillembourg, the Tower of David was viewed by many Caracas residents as a focus for crime gangs and a symbol of property ‘invasions’ encouraged in the Chavez era.

Residents, though, said the building became a refuge from the city's crime-ridden 'barrios' and had turned into something of a model commune.

An initial 160 families, out of a total of more than 1,150, are being moved out of the tower this week

But politicians say people had fallen off dangerous ledges while there are no elevators and only makeshift power and water services.

Caracas police did not share the view of a model community, raiding several times to look for kidnap victims.

The vistas, however, matched those of the city's finest high-rise buildings.

President 
Nicolas Maduro's government has not yet said what it will do with the 
tower, but one local newspaper reported Chinese banks were buying it to 
restore to its original purpose.

The Tower of David appeared a number of times in the third series of the hit U.S. television show, Homeland.

Episode three of the third series is even named 'Tower of David' and follows the fortunes of Brody (played by Damian Lewis) after he is taken to the building suffering from two bullet wounds in the abdomen.

He is held in the squat by a gang of mercenaries led by a man who is aware of Brody's true identity.

After being nursed back to health, he escapes the skyscraper and seeks refuge in a mosque, only for him to be arrested following a tip off to the police by the imam.

However, the mercenaries find Brody and, after killing the police officers, the imam and his wife, take him back to the tower where he is confined to a cell.

As the episode ends, Brody - alone in his cell - injects himself with heroin.

‘The tower does not meet the minimum conditions for safe, dignified living,’ Ernesto Villegas, minister for the transformation of Caracas, told reporters at the scene, declining to speculate on its future.

Mr Villegas said the eviction was necessary because the tower, which lacked basic fixtures such as walls or windows, was unsafe. Children have fallen to their deaths, he added.

And the damp, foul-smelling concrete courtyard where he spoke to reporters was evidence of the lack of plumbing.

An initial 160 families, out of a total of more than 1,150, were being moved out this week, he added.

Dozens
 of residents boarded buses Tuesday morning to move to new, 
government-provided apartments in Cua, a town about 23 miles (37 
kilometers) south of Caracas.

The Minister of State for the Urban Transformation of Greater Caracas, Ernesto Villegas, said many windows were missing from the 45-storey building

People have already started voluntarily moving out of the skyscraper after being promised new accommodation

The building was home to thousands over the years and many complaining about having to leave

The tower has long attracted international interest: an exhibition about it won a prize at the 2012 Venice Architecture Biennale.

Politically, the tower was a stronghold of ‘Chavismo,’ even though opponents saw it as an indictment of the failures of his government to provide adequate housing for the poor.

It was depicted in Homeland as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity.
