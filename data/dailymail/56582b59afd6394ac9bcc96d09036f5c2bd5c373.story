Their six spindly legs are often seen scurrying across the ground as they search in colonies for their next meal.

But these graceful ants have shown they can use their limbs for a whole lot more than just foraging.

This set of incredible images shows the tiny insects stretching out their legs into a sequence of elegant ballet moves.

Irina Kozorog, 37, from Moscow, Russia, has taken a series of incredible photos showing ants adopting elegant balletic poses

The mother-of-three teased the bugs into their dance positions with sweets treats such as honey and sugar

The images show the tiny creatures balancing delicately on one leg and striking several perfect poses - just like a ballet dancer

Photographer Irina 
Kozorog, 37, managed to capture the creatures balancing 
delicately on one leg - just like a ballet dancer.

The mother-of-three, who took the photographs in her homemade studio in Moscow, Russia, 
successfully teased the bugs into the perfect pirouette using sweet treats such as honey and sugar.

The photographer's interest in all things small began when she bought a camera three years ago.

She became fascinated with ants and now creates projects which venture into the unknown world of the tiny creatures.

Irina said: 'I started photographing ants on the first day I bought my camera - they're a fascinating subject to photograph.

'Most people are totally unaware that they're even there, but if you take a closer look you can see they're capable of some amazing things.'

The photographer works from her homemade studio at her home in Moscow 
and had to employ an incredible amount of patience before starting her 
project

Describing her technique, she said: 'I attract the ants with something sweet - sometimes they are even joined by a few wasps and bees on occasion.

'I think about the shot I want to take before I attempt it and then I wait patiently for the perfect shot.

'Luckily, I have a husband who supports my hobby, he is a photographer too and sometimes helps me with my ideas.

'Their tiny world is like a fairytale to me and try to capture that with my camera.'
