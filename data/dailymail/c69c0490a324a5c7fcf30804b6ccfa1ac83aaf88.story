A three-year-old girl has died from complications of swallowing a tiny battery when she was just 10-months-old.

Kylie Rose Ricards, from Taft, California, was found unresponsive at her mother's home on the 300 block of San Emidio Street on Monday August 19 and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her death is believed to be the result of complications from swallowing a button battery two years ago, which left her with permanent damage to her trachea.

In a warning to all parents, Dr. Fernando Fan told KBAK/KBFX that the consequences of swallowing the tiny batteries, which are the size of a nickel or smaller, could be grave.

They can be found in numerous household devices and gadgets, including calculators, wristwatches, hearing aids, weight scales or electronic candles.

'When [the battery] comes into contact with bodily 
fluids, it sets up a current,' he explained.

'That current - on the negative side 
of the battery - will start producing a caustic agent and then it will 
burn through the tissue.'

He said parents should instead buy devices that have locks over the batteries.

It is a serious suggestion; in 2010 - the same year Kylie Rose swallowed the battery - around 3,000 other children also did.

'There are more and more of these swallowing events every year,' Dr Fan warned.

The family has not said how Kylie Rose came into contact with the battery as a baby, but images across social networking sites show the little girl with a tracheal tube after the damage.

KBAX reported that she had loved to swim, watch television and perform for the camera. Images on Facebook reveal a vivacious little girl showered with attention from her mother, Victoria Erwin.

Erwin was too distraught to comment to the local station about her daughter.

But friends, family and people who knew the family flocked to Facebook to pay tributes to Kylie Rose, with many uploading her image as their profile pictures in tribute.

'My brothers knew Kylie,' one wrote. 'They said she was always so full of life - a little spark of energy. Kylie will be missed and Vikki, I'm so sorry for your loss, no parent should ever feel what you're feeling.'

The family is now seeking donations to help pay for Kylie Rose's funeral.
