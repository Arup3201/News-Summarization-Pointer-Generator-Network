This is the bizarre moment a bull interrupted a swimming competition - by jumping in the pool to swim alongside contestants.

Swimmers at a state level competition in Madhya Pradesh, India, watched in shock as the giant bull jumped in to the pool just seconds before they were due to start the competition.

The animal is understood to have entered the building via an open side door, and enjoyed his dip in the pool for over an hour - with indifferent competitors simply continuing to swim around him.

Taking a dip: The large bull entered a swimming complex in Madhya Pradesh on the day of a state-level competition. Just seconds before event was due to begin, the animal jumped into the water

Unfazed: The animal is understood to have entered the building via an open side door, and enjoyed his dip in the pool for over an hour - with indifferent competitors simply continuing to swim around him

Looking on: In total the bull's visit to the swimming pool delayed the competition by an hour - but all involved were happy that neither the bull nor any competitors or spectators were harmed during the incident

The paddling bull was eventually coerced into the corner of the pool, where a group of brave swimmers managed to heave him up and out of the water.

The animal was completely unfazed by the dramatic incident and was simply ushered back outside the building, where he was left wet but otherwise totally unharmed.

One of the coaches at the event said: 'The bull was sitting in the corner of the pool complex before competition started. But as we were about to begin, he started moving into the water.'

Cornered: The bull was eventually coerced to the side of the pool, where a group of brave swimmers managed to heave him up and out of the water to safety

Footage of the dramatic was shot by local cameraman Rahul Dravid last week.

Describing the incident, Mr Dravid said: 'It was very unexpected. I was just setting up ready for the competitions to begin a little later when the cow ended up in the pool.'

'I quickly grabbed my camera and filmed as it paddled about in the water,' he added.

Cattle are considered sacred by Hindus in India, where strict laws limit  protect the animals - particularly within the food industry.

As a result many Indians are reluctant to impede the progress of cows and bulls and leave the animals to wander the streets unhindered in much of the country. 

It is not uncommon for these freewheeling cattle to find their way into buildings.
