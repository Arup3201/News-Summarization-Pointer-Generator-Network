Cheap and nasty food from around the world is being dressed up as high quality and pushed out through high street stores and restaurants.

Honey, cheese, eggs, organic meat and produce, Basmati rice, even fish and chips are not necessarily what they seem.

Just before Christmas one British firm was fined more than £20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet.

The naked truth: Stark Naked Foods passed off cheaper pesto sauces as something far more gourmet

Stark Naked Foods claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese, when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese.

At the same time,  pubs and restaurants are not immune to boasting of offering local quality food, when this actually means the nearest supermarket or wholesaler.

One estimate suggests British families are wasting as much as £7billion a year paying over the odds for food that has been faked in some way..

There are cases of imported beef from Zebu cattle, which have a distinctive hump on their neck, being imported from south America and sold in pubs as 'British'.

Meat from cross-breed cattle containing Zebu genes from Brazil is cheaper than British beef, however critics point out that it can also be much tougher.

Vast quantities of cheap honey is being imported into Europe from China and used to bulk up other types in a scam that has become known as 'honey- laundering'.

In some cases honey is not honey at all, but rather corn syrup or just sugar.

Butcher shops and leading restaurants
have been found selling conventional meat and produce as organic, along
with a premium price.

In the past, even Harrods has been found selling farmed salmon as wild.

But the fakery does not stop at salmon, for some fish and chip shops have been prosecuted for passing off Shark Catfish, which is farmed in the rivers of Vietnam's Mekong delta, as battered cod.

The fish sells for less than half the
price of real cod in wholesale markets, however chip shop customers are
being charged as if it is the real thing.

2011: Gourmet pesto sauce sold by Stark Naked Foods was supposed to contain extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese. In fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese. The firm was fined £23,500

2010: Egg packer jailed after making at least £3million by passing off foreign battery cage eggs as free range. The eggs were sold through Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s. Keith Owen, from Worcestershire, was jailed for three years.

2007: Steaks sold by the Hungry Horse chain and restaurants in JD Wetherspoons pubs contained Zebu genes. This is not illegal, but diners may be short-changed as Zebu is known to be tougher than British beef. The steaks were imported from Brazil.

2007: Mitchells & Butler group, which owns Vintage Inns, O’Neills, All Bar One and Browns. prosecuted for food fraud. A buffalo mozzarella turned out to be full-fat cow’s cheese;  Gloucestershire ham came from Bedfordshire farms; Irish Wexford cheese was a run of the mill mature cheddar.

2007: Harrods, Sainsbury’s and others found selling farmed salmon as more expensive wild-caught varieties. Other stores were selling farmed sea bass and sea bream as wild.

2005: Two butchers in Richmond, Surrey, prosecuted for selling organic chicken, sausages and lamb that came from conventional farms.

2005: Julie’s Restaurant, Notting Hill, found to be selling marinated roast chicken, sausages and spiced rack of lamb as organic, when in fact they were serving up cheaper meats.

2003: Thousands of tonnes of 'plastic chicken' imported into UK, according to Food Standards Agency . This is chicken pumped up with water, chemicals and flavourings.

Fined: Pies from Linda McCartney’s range (library image) were falsely labelled 'suitable for vegetarians'

2003: 46 per cent of Basmati rice samples were bulked up with cheaper varieties, according to FSA.

2003: Salami imported from Belgium and Italy contained horse meat. Two were bought at a Safeway store.

2002: Chicken that was due to go for pet food put into the human food chain - school meals, supermarkets, chicken nuggets – by Denby Poultry Products, of Derbyshire.

1993 Pies from Linda McCartney’s range were falsely labelled as 'suitable for vegetarians' but contained meat. Supplier Ross Young was fined £2,250 after the inspection by trading standards officers.

Teacher, Luke Marvell, nearly died 
after suffering an allergic reaction to eating Vietnamese catfish sold 
as a traditional fish supper by a chip shop in Leicester in 2011.

The 26-year-old was two mouthfuls into his meal when his face and throat began to swell, his head started to itch and he struggled to breathe.

He was rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary where doctors established the cause.

Director of policy at the Trading Standards Institute, Andy Foster, warned that a squeeze on spending means his members find it increasingly difficult to stem the problem.

He said: 'Food fraud has been an issue that dates back more than 100 years. There are numerous examples.

Caught: Even upmarket Harrods in London has been found selling farmed salmon as wild in the past

'Things like extending – bulking up – meat products with other species is common in catering. We have known this with certain types of take-away food and fish, for example.

'Where there is a price differential there is always a temptation for a more unscrupulous manufacturer to make a switch and try and get away with it.'

Mr Foster said: 'Wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it.

'In times of recession, when people are looking for a bargain and going to different places, that is where you start to find more fraud introduced to food.'

Policing of food companies and restaurants is the job of trading standards officers, however spending on these services and number of people on the ground has been cut sharply in the last two years.

Mr Foster said: 'With the limited resources that trading standards have, which is diminishing year on year, they are less able to carry out the more routine sampling we would normally do.'
