A man who wanted to claim asylum in Britain and said he was a child to avoid deportation was caught out when staff at his children's home noticed he had facial hair.

They also thought the Afghan's deep voice and tattoo were incompatible with his claim of being 12.

However it took four years until they were able to prove the Afghan's real age.

Now, finally, the young man - who is now 22 - faces being sent back to his country following an immigration tribunal in London.

The asylum seeker came to Birmingham hidden on a lorry in December 2008, saying his mother had told him he was 12 just before he left Afghanistan.

He said his grandfather had urged him to escape his homeland because he was in trouble with people there for something his father had done.

The young man - then nearly 18 - claimed he was 12 because being classed as a lone minor gives asylum seekers a better chance of being allowed to stay in the UK.

Border authorities do not have facilities for looking after children, so they are often put into children's home while courts decide their fate, and being classed as children can help their cases.

Staff at the Birmingham children's home he was placed in became suspicious because he arrived with a small moustache that disappeared overnight, and had a deep voice and a tattoo on the back of his hand.

Social worker Swaran Singh told judges at the immigration tribunal that he had assessed several Afghans seeking asylum in Britain, the Sun reported.

He said: 'A high proportion [of Afghans] claim their mothers told them how old they were a short time before leaving their country.

'This sounds like a stock phrase and I wonder whether agents advise individuals to say this.'

The hearing found no evidence of the man being persecuted at home, nor did they track down any relatives, but the judges ruled: 'The applicant's lack of credibility points strongly towards him being above or very close to attaining the age of maturity when he arrived in the UK.'
