Most dogs can't wait to explore the great outdoors. 

But for Sam the black Labrador, just the mere mention of walkies is enough to make him hide behind the sofa. 

The one-year-old puppy suffers from agoraphobia after he was electrocuted and is now terrified of going outside.

Scaredy dog: Terrified Sam has to be dragged through the streets of Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, by his owner because he is too scared to leave the house

The once curious dog had been investigating smells in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, when he touched a metal drain which had an electric current flowing through it due to a fault in the power supply of a nearby street light. 

Despite taking strong medication since the incident, the terrified pup now has to be dragged around the streets of Stonehaven because he is scared stiff to leave the house.

Owner, Donna Simpson, 36, said: 'I was just taking him for his usual walk when he suddenly jumped off the pavement onto the road and just went mental

'Since then, when you head out of the door to take him for a walk, he's just not having it.

'If you try to cross the road or go anywhere else then that's it, he digs his heels in and he won't go - you've got to drag him.'

Miss Simpson's children, Jamie, two, and Ryan, 13, are desperate for their pet to recover to his usual playful self.

She said: 'The boys are both really upset at what has happened to Sam.

'Jamie would always play with him, climb on him and pull at him and Sam wouldn't bat an eyelid, but not now.

'The vet gave me a special powder to through Sam's food for 20 days and it calmed him down a bit, but now he's finished his course, he's worse than ever.

'When he had that electric shock I'd never seen him react like that before. He's a black Labrador, which is the most docile dog you can get.'

The faulty street light behind Sam's woes is operated by Aberdeenshire Council.

Miss Simpson, a director of a cleaning and maintenance company, said: 'We weren't the only ones to be affected by this, there were other people I've spoken to who had the same problem with their dogs before Sam got an electric shock.

'The dog warden and a health and safety officer checked out the pavement on December 28 and they decided that there was nothing wrong.

'The council only cordoned off the area on the 29th and as far as I'm concerned if there had been complaints before then, there should have been more investigation into what was causing it.'

But a spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council insisted it was not aware of the hazard before Sam was shocked. 

'The hydro board called us out about it on November 29, which was after the complainant's dog suffered an electric shock.

'The place was then cordoned off at nine o'clock that night.

'In conjunction with Scottish Hydro, the fault was identified and rectified as a matter of urgency.'

Scottish Hydro Electric discovered the drain had become electrified because of a fault in the power supply to the street lights.

The fault had caused the power to short circuit down a drain pipe which leads to the metal drainage channel that runs across the pavement.

A spokeswoman from Scottish Hydro Electric added: 'The issue was resolved on the evening of December 3.

'It wasn't an electrocution, but the dog would have suffered an electric shock which obviously is very unfortunate, but I can confirm that the area is safe now.'

Sam still suffers from agoraphobia despite taking drugs for the condition

Dogs can experience a variety of emotional and psychological disorders which can occur or are caused by either negative experiences, medical problems or by how the dog has spent the first weeks of its life.

Agoraphobia is however, rare in dogs, especially when you consider how much they like to go for walks. 

But some canines are sensitive souls and can have fears and phobias, including fear of new places or situations, fear of unfamiliar people and or other dogs.

The most common fear related problems are noise phobias, involving thunder, gunshots and fireworks. 

There are drugs which can be prescribed to combat these kind of behaviours including agoraphobia, anxiety, aggression and for mood stabilisation.

The phobias or fears in agoraphobia for humans involve activities such as leaving home, entering public places or travelling alone. 

In these situations the person feels especially vulnerable and exposed, with nowhere to escape to or hide if things go wrong.

An unusual but not uncommon feature of agoraphobia is a fear of crossing bridges, known as gephyrophobia.

This is related to a feeling that, once on the bridge, there is no immediately available exit.

The degree of fear and avoidance behaviour varies. Although many sufferers do manage to get out to work, some become completely housebound.

Agoraphobia typically affects women and begins in early adulthood.

They may have other psychological problems too, especially anxiety, depression, depersonalisation, panic attacks and obsessive behaviour.
