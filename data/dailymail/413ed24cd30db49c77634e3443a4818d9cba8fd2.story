Empathy: In February, Victoria Beckham paid a visit to South Africa, where she met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr. Mitch Besser and his 'mentor mothers' who provide support and education about HIV. She was so moved by the cause that she's selling 600 items from her wardrobe to raise money for the charity

In February this year, following an invitation from Vogue editor Anna Wintour and American Vogue to visit South Africa, Victoria met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr. Mitch Besser.

His charity trains, employs and empowers 'mentor mothers', who are mothers living with HIV, in order to educate them on how to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and improve the health of women and their families.

Victoria was so moved by the experience that she wanted to do all she could to raise money and awareness.

Speaking about the cause, she said: ‘After spending just a few days with these remarkable women and learning more about the charity from Mitch, and his lovely wife Annie Lennox, I wanted to do as much as I could. It really was a life-changing experience; I’ve never experienced anything like it.’

Victoria felt that a sale of items from her wardrobe could be an incredibly powerful way to raise both money and awareness.

Speaking about having Victoria on board, Mitch Besser, the found of mothers2mothers, told MailOnline: 'Victoria is a role model and a global icon, we are so happy to have her on board.

'Victoria came into the hospital wards in South Africa and when she saw what was going on she realised this was totally preventable and asked what she could do to help.

'She met the mentor mothers during her visit and she felt a certain attachment to them. She related to them because, like them, she's a working mother who just wants the best for her family.

'She was a wonderful visitor, so empathetic. She was really interested in what she could do to help the mothers. By selling her clothes and helping a charity, it really does connect her interests.'

With help from her mother and sister, Victoria carefully selected iconic pieces from her wardrobe - pieces from her early days with the Spice Girls, that she wore out with David Beckham, and from catwalk appearances, parties, awards shows and other events that have been heavily documented and photographed by the world’s press.

The Outnet will be selling the items in a private online sale. The pieces include hats, shoes, bags and jewellery, designer ready-to-wear, costume pieces, coats, skiwear and evening dresses.  

As a special treat for Victoria Beckham fans and the e-tailer's customers, an auction of 10 of the most iconic pieces from Victoria’s wardrobe will be put up for sale in a ‘Going, Going, Gone’ reverse auction, where the starting price reduces by a fixed amount every five minutes.

The ‘Going, Going, Gone’ reverse auction will begin at 9.30am on August 20. The reverse auction consists of 10 of the most iconic pieces from Victoria Beckham’s wardrobe and will take place over five days. 

As a reverse auction, each item being sold will have a starting price and a reserve price. The starting price will reduce by a fixed amount every five minutes before it reaches its end price over a period of six hours - unless the item is sold before the end of the sixth hour. 

Pieces such as the full length, white Dolce & Gabbana dress worn for the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards and the fluorescent yellow Roberto Cavalli gown worn for the pre-World Cup party in 2006 at David and Victoria Beckham’s country house will be part of the auction. 

Speaking about working with Victoria, Stephanie Phair, President of TheOutnet, told MailOnline: 'Victoria is a global celebrity with iconic clothes, as well as being a respected designer, so owning one of these is like getting your own slice of pop history.

'Victoria was extremely clear about what she wanted to do and our team worked overtime, donating their own free time to the cause because they were so inspired by her. 

'Mitch even came into the office to thank the staff personally. This just goes to show what can be achieved when everyone pitches in.'

The funds that are raised will help mothers2mothers’ Mentor Mothers reach even more HIV-positive mothers with critical health education and support, to stay healthy and protect their babies from HIV infection.

'HIV infections in children and maternal and infant deaths from AIDS are unnecessary and unacceptable. With the right education and empowerment, no baby should ever be born with HIV and no mother should die of AIDS,' said Mitch.

'If a mother gets a test and medication, the transmission rate is very low and with these funds, we can guarantee that a baby has a normal, healthy life without HIV.

'Mothers2mothers started off working with one hospital back in 2001 and now reaches 20 per cent of the HIV positive women in the world.

'I am very proud of what we've achieved and we now have a global plan to eliminate aids.'
