The owners of a Christmas attraction were left scratching their heads after one of their reindeers shed her antlers hours before  visitors were due to arrive.

Blitzen the reindeer was settled into her new temporary Christmas quarters on Sunday night ahead of the grand opening of a seasonal festival.

But  as she was about to welcome families the following morning, her owner  opened the doors to her closure and found the animal was missing her trademark antlers.

Blitzen the reindeer shocked owners of Old Holly Farm in Garstang, Lancashire by shedding her antlers the day before visitors were due to arrive

The animals shed their antlers annually, usually in the spring, and owners of the farm did not expect the phenomenon to happen before Christmas

Ian Pye, who works at Old Holly Farm in Garstang, Lancashire, said: 'We've had so many visitors since we opened on Monday and people are really shocked to see a reindeer without antlers.

'I think a lot of people don't realise that reindeers shed their antlers so they all seem amazed.

'We've assured the children that it won't stop her flying on Christmas Eve so they don't seem to mind.

'Normally, reindeers shed their antlers in early spring so it's really unusual to see it this early. I wonder whether it's because the weather has been really mild and she's got a bit confused.'

The antlers have now been attached to the fencing posts outside the deers' enclosure, alongside a note explaining how reindeer regrow their antlers each year. 

But keeper Ian Pye say that Blitzen - even without her trademark antlers - is still popular with visitors
