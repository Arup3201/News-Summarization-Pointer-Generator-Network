A sick baby was rushed to hospital after a supermarket pharmacy refused to hand his medication to his father because part of the prescription had been written in Welsh.

Aled Mann, 34, took the prescription from the family doctors to his local Morrisons pharmacy counter after his one-year-old son Harley developed a chest infection.

But staff at the supermarket in Bangor, north Wales, refused to give him the steroid tablets because they could not read the note as not all of it was in English.

Mr Mann got the medication two hours later after driving back to the GP surgery and waiting for another prescription to be printed in English which he then took back to the pharmacy.

But baby Harley's condition worsened and he had to be admitted to hospital for treatment the next morning.

Writing on Facebook earlier this week, Mr Mann said: 'I can’t believe Morrisons wouldn’t give us Harley’s prescription for a chest infection today because it was in Welsh.

'No other pharmacist in Bangor or Caernarfon had what he needed so we had to go back to the surgery to get it changed.'

He later added: 'Unfortunately Harley was admitted to hospital this morning.

'Who knows, if he’d have had the steroid tablets when he needed them it could have been avoided.'

Mr Mann and his wife Alys, 33, live in the 2,000-strong seaside village of Felinheli, near Bangor, north Wales.

Their
 GP Dr Ieuan Parry in the Welsh language stronghold printed the 
prescription for baby Harley’s steroid tablets in their native language.

Arfon Wyn, a local councillor, said the news was 'disturbing'.

He said: 'The parents were forced to dash back to the surgery to try and get the prescription changed.

'But from what I understand this was too late and the child had to be rushed to Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital for treatment.

'This is totally diabolical. It is the trend of these large supermarkets not to employ bilingual local people and so such terrible events as this can take place.'

Mr Wyn said he planned to organise a protest of councillors and local business people at the store to demand a full investigation and apology.

A Morrisons spokesman said: 'The pharmacy team are looking into it and are working with the store and area pharmacy team to find out what has happened.'
