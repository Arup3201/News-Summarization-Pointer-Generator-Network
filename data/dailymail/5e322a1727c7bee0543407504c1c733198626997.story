Friends and fans fears that Britney Spears will not be able to handle a long-term stint in Las Vegas after being dropped by the X Factor and splitting from her fiancé Jason Trawick all in the space of a week.

The 31-year-old star is on the brink of signing a mega $100 million deal with one of the Caesars group 
properties - after Jason formally resigned as her conservator.

However, sources have told of their fears for Britney, as one told MailOnline: 'I'm not sure just how good an idea Vegas is for Britney right now. If she can't handle the X Factor - how will she be able to perform five days a week in Vegas?

Britney confirmed her departure from the talent show on the same day as her split from Jason and the source said: 'She's a homebody, she loves her sons and has her daily routine. At this time, she may need to concentrate on her health and happiness - not rebuilding her career.'

It's over: Britney Spears has split from fiance Jason Trawick after a year-long engagement

Britney and Jason announced the end of their one-year engagement on Friday and the singer said in a statement: 'Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I'll always adore him and we will remain great friends.'

Jason added: 'As this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.'

The couple were so entwined that Jason accompanied Britney nearly everywhere. Indeed, on the rare occasions she was seen alone it was to go shopping or get coffee near her California home.

One
source told how Jason had helped immeasurably in helping Britney to get
her life back on track and was a constant by her side during filming on
the X Factor, saying: 'At auditions, Jason would calmly escort Britney 
by the hand back and forth to her seat during breaks. He was there for 
her.'

Painting a 
picture of a rather nervous woman, another source recalled being at an 
industry party at Soho House in Los Angeles in September where Britney 
was a guest, saying: 'Britney stood in a corner and hid.

'She didn't speak to anyone - you wouldn't even have realised she was there. She's a shy, shy girl.'

Still friends: The pair were last pictured together last month and their relationship apparently became more of a friendship, with them sleeping in separate bedrooms

Court papers: Official papers reveal that Jason Trawick is no longer responsible for Britney Spears 

Britney and Jason had been staying at the W Hotel in Hollywood during the X Factor filming, but a friend told how they had their own rooms as they had become 'just friends'.

Britney is now believed to be back at her home in Calabasas with her sons Sean, seven, and Jayden, six, and Jason has moved out.

Jason
also acted as Britney's manager, and the pop star has now changed 
management to CAA, indicating the pair have also severed ties in their business
relationship.

Court papers just release show resigned as Britney's co-conservator, but her father Jamie Spears will remain as conservator.

Moved out: Trawick ios no longer living with Britney; he is seen grocery shopping in Calabasas last month

Reports had suggested that Britney's father Jamie had in fact brokered his daughter's break-up with Jason himself, and a friend confirmed: 'I did hear this.'

Radar Online reported: 'Jason wanted out, and in the fragile state that Britney is in, it’s not like he could have a rational conversation with her about it, so it was really between him and Jamie.

They decided how the relationship needed to end and how to go about the technicalities, such as removing Jason from the conservatorship, when he would move out and how to announce the split. Britney was left out of everything and really didn’t even know what was going on.

'Jason and Jamie wanted to make sure that Britney didn’t lose it, so they had to water things down for her a bit.'

Keeping close: Britney assures fans that she and Jason will 'remain great friends' and added that she will 'always adore him'

Britney had raked in $15 million for her judging role on the X Factor.

Announcing her departure from the Fox talent show, she said: 'I had an incredible time doing the show and I love the other judges and I am so proud of my teens but it's time for me to get back in the studio.

'Watching them all do their thing up 
on that stage every week made me miss performing so much! I can't wait 
to get back out there and do what I love most.'

However, the Grammy winner's team has already begun 'serious talks' for a lucrative Vegas concert deal.

Severing all ties: Jason used to act as Britney's manager but the star, seen with Jason in October, has now changed management

According to TMZ, Britney and her 
people have been in serious negotiations with one of the Caesars group 
properties for 'a while.'

The former Mouseketeer is likely 
being wooed to star in her own long-running show at the Colloseum at 
Caesar's Palace since that is where Cher and Celine Dion also held 
residencies.

Dion scored $100 million a year to 
headline her show and her previous A New Day show grossed more than $400
million over five years.

Cher also struck a lucrative deal with the casino where she performed for three years at $60 million a year.

And speaking to E!, Daren Libonati, president and COO of the promotion and production company Justice Entertainment Group, said Britney could earn up to $2 million a week at a place like Caesars Palace.

E! calculated that if she worked 40 
weeks a year, that's $48 million a year for her. And if she signs up for
a Dion-like residency of three years, that's $144 million.

Mr Libonati said: 'Deals such as this are based on scale. That's a very basic guess on what such a deal might look like. It could be even more.'

However, fans wrote of their dismay at the idea. Writing on MailOnline, one said: 'She couldn't handle 3 months of twice a week X-Factor.. What makes you think she can handle a VEGAS show. She needs to stay home and be a mom! I feel horrible for her!'

While, Agnes from Stockholm, Sweden said: 'How ill-advised! If Britney had a chance of seeing such a committment through with Trawick, there's just no chance she'd manage now.

'We are talking about someone who has documented mental issues, someone who has made headlines for just the number of breaks she needed during tje the X-factor auditions. We are talking about someone who lip-sang all through her last world tour despite many of her fans' outrage.

'A Las Vegas residency must be a huge challenge for any performer and the pressure surely must be enough to break even the strongest of characters.

'How will a person as mentally vulnerable as Britney is said to be, manage demanding shows several nights a week, week after week, month after month, for one, or two or three years in a row? I am afraid her paying fans shall have to brace themeselves for a huge and disappointment if such a deal is closed, her critics will have a field day and Britney herself may be pushed over the edge and onto another mental breakdown as a result.'

However, a close friend of Britney told MailOnline today: 'She is well and has amazing family and friends who love her. She is dancing five days a week and is in the studio working on her 8th album. She is in demand career wise.'
