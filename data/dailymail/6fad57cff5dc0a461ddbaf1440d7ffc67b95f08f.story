So Mario Balotelli is on the brink of joining Liverpool and completing the shock move of the summer.

When I first saw the news breaking, my initial reaction was ‘This can’t be true’; I had serious misgivings. Since then, though, I have changed my stance because of the economics — £16million for a 24-year-old who is Italy’s No 1 striker looks a great deal. If you consider Ross McCormack moved from Leeds to Fulham for £11m, it is even better value.

And if Balotelli fails to deliver, Liverpool could expect to recoup most of their outlay. I admit he still has to convince me as a player. People talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that doesn’t worry me too much and, in truth, I think some of it is quite funny.

It is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important, and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed. We faced each other a few times when he was in England and I never saw a lot from him at Anfield. He was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute.

There is, however, a player lurking in that frame. He has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced England at major tournaments, causing problems with his pace and power. If he’s like that, Liverpool will have done some smart business.

Daniel Sturridge will find three games a week difficult, so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing. Above all, Liverpool have a fabulous spirit under Brendan Rodgers that has carried them far. Balotelli can’t be allowed to jeopardise that.
