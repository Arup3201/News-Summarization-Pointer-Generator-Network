Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is uncertain whether captain Ron Vlaar will stay with the club, but stressed he has received no bids for the defender and is 'totally at ease' about the situation.

Holland centre-back Vlaar, who impressed at this summer's World Cup, has been linked with various sides of late, including Villa's Barclays Premier League rivals Southampton.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman, his compatriot, has been quoted by Dutch media as saying of the 29-year-old that he would 'really like to have him at Southampton'.

Will he stay or will he go? Ron Vlaar may be heading out of Aston Villa before the end of the transfer window

But Lambert said on Thursday: 'Nobody has even picked up the phone to ask about him.

'If someone picks up the phone, then you talk. But nobody has.'

Asked if he thought Vlaar would remain loyal to Villa, Lambert replied: 'I don't know.

'I'm not sure there is loyalty in football any more. So we'll have to wait and see. It will be entirely up to him.'

Vlaar has a year left on his current Villa contract, and talks over a new one have not yet been opened.

On the prospect of the player re-signing with the midlands outfit, Lambert said: 'To be fair to Ron, he has not come to us or anything.

'We have had little chats here and there, but I think his main concern was getting back after the World Cup, getting fit and hopefully being ready for Saturday (Villa's Premier League opener at Stoke).

'That is where he has been. I have a good rapport with Ron, so I don't have any problem with that whatsoever.'

He added: 'We have never really had a chat about it (Vlaar staying or not). I'm pretty sure once it kind of settles down, there will be time for that.

'I am sitting here at ease with it - it doesn't really bother me at the moment.

'I'm sure I'll sit with Randy (Lerner, Villa's owner, and discuss the situation).

'I'm pretty sure things will evolve over the next few weeks or so, and we'll see what happens. But at the moment I'm totally at ease with everything, and so is Ron.'

Lambert will check the condition of both World Cup semi-finalist Vlaar and new signing Joe Cole (thigh) ahead of Saturday's match but is optimistic both will be able to feature.

Lambert has also reported strikers Christian Benteke and Libor Kozak are ahead of schedule in their rehabilitation from long-term injuries and could be available in 'a few weeks'.

Belgium international Benteke has been sidelined since April, when he suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in training with Villa that ruled him out of the World Cup and which the club said would require a minimum of six months' recovery time.

Kozak sustained his injury in training with Villa as well, the Czech Republic frontman breaking his leg in January.

Not flustered: Villa boss Paul Lambert remains calm about the prospect of Vlaar leaving the club 

Another long-term absentee, defender Jores Okore, could be in line for his first competitive appearance since September having recovered from a serious knee problem.

There could also be comebacks for winger Charles N'Zogbia, out for all of last term with an Achilles injury, as well as defender Alan Hutton and striker Darren Bent, who have previously been exiled from the Villa first-team and out on loan. All four have been involved in the club's pre-season.

Bent has said he is feeling 'really positive' and 'confident about what's ahead', although Lambert has emphasised the ex-Sunderland man has work to do.

When on loan for the season at Fulham in 2013/14, Bent scored six goals in 30 appearances in all competitions, and Lambert said: 'He had a bit of a barren spell even there.

'So he is going to have to really work at it - it is not going to come easy to him.

'Even the Fulham spell was a bit tough for him and he didn't really score that many goals.

'It is an opportunity for him now back here and it is up to himself.'

Along with midfielder Cole, Saturday could also see competitive Villa debuts for three other summer recruits in defenders Philippe Senderos and Aly Cissokho and wide man Kieran Richardson.

Meanwhile, reports have suggested Elche's Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez will be next to join, but Lambert was giving little away on that front on Thursday.

'The situation is that he is still not our player,' Lambert said.

'We'll have to see what happens over the next few days or so.'
