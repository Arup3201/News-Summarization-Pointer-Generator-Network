A British soldier fired shots, made death threats and hit Iraqi prisoners after they were captured on the battlefield, an inquiry into alleged war crimes heard today.

The former military intelligence officer is accused of inflicting the abuse while questioning nine detainees at Camp Abu Naji, a UK base in southern Iraq, in May 2004.

The ex-serviceman - identified only by the codename M004 - admitted trying to 'frighten and intimidate' the insurgents in a bid to prise crucial information from them.

He said he used a 1ft-long metal tent peg to bang on a table top and shouted and screamed at detainees as part of his 'tactical questioning' technique.

But he told the long-running Al-Sweady Inquiry that he 'categorically denied' striking or physically threatening any of the prisoners.

The soldier, who served in the Army for 24 years, has been accused by several Iraqi captives of firing two pistol shots into the ground while they were being questioned in a tent at the military camp.

There were also allegations by a detainee that M004 beat him with a metal pipe and another claimed he was warned he would be executed if he did not tell the truth.

He said: 'It is a complete fabrication to say that two shots were fired. This did not happen. I never fired a weapon or allowed anyone else to fire a weapon in the tactical questioning tent.

'There is no feasible way that a shot could be fired in the tent without someone hearing it and it being reported and discussed throughout the camp.

'I categorically deny ever hitting any of the detainees, nor did I see any other soldiers beat and/or kick any detainees. I did not threaten a detainee with execution.'

Retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes is examining allegations that UK troops executed up to 20 prisoners, including a 14-year-old boy, and mistreated nine others after a battle at an Army checkpoint.

The inquiry is named after 19-year-old Hameed Al-Sweady, one of those who died after a firefight between UK soldiers and insurgents at the Danny Boy checkpoint three miles north of the town of Majar Al Kabir.

The inquiry is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base (above, file picture)

It is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base.

The claims have been strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle.

M004 had no involvement with the deaths of any Iraqis during the disputed events of May 14, 2004.

His evidence is confined to the treatment of detainees.

He had carried out the 'tactical questioning' of all nine detainees in the aftermath of the battle. Each interrogation lasted up to 17 minutes.

The witness said the tent peg was never used to strike a detainee but he said banging it on a table behind the prisoner was intended to scare them and 'soften' them up.

He said a questioning technique called 'harshing' routinely involved walking behind the detainee, blowing on the back of their neck, banging the tent peg down on the table and then screaming and shouting over their left shoulder and into their ear.

Blowing on the detainee's neck allowed the interrogator to get inside the prisoner's personal space so that he could feel the questioner's presence, something which was 'remarkably effective' he said.

The aim was to keep detainees in a state of uncertainty so they would not feel too comfortable and clam up.

Questioners were trying to discover information about insurgent weapons, armed gangs and planned attacks on UK troops.

But M004 told the counsel to the inquiry that he did not believe some of the tactics would be 'permissible' today because the rules had been changed.

The hearing, in central London, has already heard evidence from Iraqis, including relatives and medical staff, and military personnel.

Evidence from military witnesses will continue until March. It is hoped the inquiry report will be finished by the end of the year.
