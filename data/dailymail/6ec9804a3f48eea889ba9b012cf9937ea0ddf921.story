Real Madrid proved European champions travel in style  as Cristiano Ronaldo and Co arrived in Germany in a private plane for their Champions League last-16 meeting with Schalke.

The team sitting top of La Liga face fourth-placed Bundesliga club Schalke at the Veltins-Arena on Wednesday night, and are aiming to defend their crown after achieving La Decima last year.

Real proved unbeatable before the turn of the year as they won 21 consecutive matches but Carlo Ancelotti's team have stalled, including a humiliating 4-0 defeat against rivals Atletico Madrid.

Gareth Bale may be among those glad to escape Madrid after being booed by Real supporters during their 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna at the Bernabeu on Saturday.

The Wales international has been singled out  lately, while Iker Casillas and manager Ancloetti were also jeered during the win that kept them top of La Liga.

A win in Europe could do wonders, but they'll have to do it without injured stars James Rodriguez, Fabio Coentrao, Sami Khedira, Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric.
