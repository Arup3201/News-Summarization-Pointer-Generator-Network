The brother of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett says he is ‘offended and angered’ by claims from a group of paranormal investigators that they may have found killer Ian Brady’s spade.

The spade, which has no handle, was reportedly discovered on Saddleworth Moor by members of the Worsley Paranormal Group, which has been searching for Keith’s remains.

They claimed to have found it at a spot where they believe Keith is buried.

But Keith’s brother Alan Bennett said on an internet forum dedicated to finding Keith’s remains: 'This is complete nonsense as is the Worsley Paranormal Group’s theories and activities.

'They are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them. They also post videos claiming to have picked up Keith on a "ghost box" machine, all of which I find totally disgusting.

'They know my thoughts on their "findings" and when they realised, finally, that I could not take them seriously, they got very angry to the point of being abusive.

'It seems now they, just like the other "oddballs" in the news lately, have gone to a newspaper. They have seen their moment to jump on the bandwagon with all the recent publicity about the case.

'This is just another of several spades that have been found on the moor. It is not near any real area of interest to anybody but themselves. I have spoken about these people with the police and we all agreed their "evidence" was of the sort that did not warrant further consideration - to put it mildly.'

He added: 'I am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people.'

Keith’s mother Winnie Johnson, who died last month, fought a long campaign to get Brady to reveal the location of her son’s body.

A senior lecturer in forensic analytical science at the University of Manchester has examined the spade but said he had been unable to discover its origin as it was ‘very corroded’.

Forensic expert, Steve Kershaw, Senior Lecturer in Forensic Analytical Science at the University of Manchester told the
BBC: 'Even if we had lots more time and even if we had established that
it was a spade from the 60s or pre-dated the 60s, we would not have 
necessarily established if it was anything to do with Ian Brady.

'The only way we would have been able to
tell is if it had DNA on it and that is harder to tell with the handle 
gone (and) it being so corroded. Although some vegetation has survived (on it), there is very little chance of DNA having survived.'

Mr Bennett added: 'This "find" is of no help to us. A spade may well have been found again, but it does not tie in with any of the other information or evidence we have relating to Keith.

'Their need for publicity and their 
desperation to get anyone to listen to them is evident from their 
pursuit of various individuals, usually as uninformed or as crass as themselves, on the internet.'

Claims emerged last month that Brady had
penned a letter - not to be opened until after his death - to Winnie 
that revealed details of Keith's burial spot on the moor.

Police launched an investigation and 
arrested Brady's mental health advocate Jackie Powell but the letter has
not been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the 
killer.
