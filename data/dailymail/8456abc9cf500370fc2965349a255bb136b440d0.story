A primary school ‘superhead’ being paid £170,000 a year refitted her office with £26,000 worth of furniture.

A probe by finance watchdogs found the Silver Birch Academy Trust, led by Patricia Davies, spent £4,500 on a desk and £1,700 on a fridge.

The trust runs two primary schools in east London which between them cater for about 750 pupils.

Following a tip-off from two whistleblowers, officials from the Education Funding Agency investigated the trust and queried the spending of tens of thousands of pounds.

An office for Mrs Davies at one school was kitted out with a £4,487 desk, a £4,887 conference table, a £4,967 wall unit, a £1,687 fridge unit and 14 wood-framed executive leather armchairs costing £4,998. The total bill, including other chairs, a glass coffee table and pot plants, was £25,996.

‘We have not seen a business case to support the assertion that these represented value for money,’ EFA investigators concluded in their report.

A further £20,500 was spent on other offices in the school, Whittingham Primary Academy, giving a total spend on furniture of £46,490.

The report pointed out that the school’s policy is to obtain quotes for spending above £5,000.

On a single date in May last year, seven invoices totalling more than £20,000 – but each under the £5,000 threshold – had been made out.

‘The executive head teacher stated that there was no intention to split payments and this was not an attempt to avoid the need for written quotations,’ the report said.

Mrs Davies – named head teacher of the year at the 2011 Teaching Awards for transforming the fortunes of Chingford Hall Primary, which she also runs – told the EFA the furniture would help the academy generate rental income.

The report said: ‘The executive head teacher explained that she was looking for a particular product that she had seen at another academy and that the table, chairs and built-in fridge unit will provide a quality facility, a change to the profile of the school, that can be rented out for external meetings.’

Details of the report were highlighted yesterday by campaign group Local Schools Network. It said that a Freedom of Information request a month ago asking how often the head’s office had been rented out for meetings had so far received no reply.

The EFA report – published earlier this year with a series of recommendations for the trust on improving its practice – also questioned the process for commissioning £200,000 worth of refurbishments to the main Whittingham Primary building.

The school was judged ‘good’ by Ofsted at its last inspection, the second highest rating.

Latest accounts for the Silver Birch Academy Trust show Mrs Davies was paid £170,000 to £175,000 in 2012/13 – around three times the typical salary for a primary head.

Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s simply no excuse for this wasteful spending.

‘Taxpayers will be furious that their money has been spent on top-of-the-range desks and fridges, and the head teacher’s huge salary rubs salt in the wound. You have to wonder why it was deemed appropriate to spend money on furniture rather than children’s education.’

It emerged yesterday that another academy chain, Inspiration Trust, spent £420 on a Vera Wang tea set, £2,775 on a table, £3,400 on two Boss armchairs and £2,600 on a Boss sofa.

The Norwich-based trust insisted the expenditure was reasonable.
