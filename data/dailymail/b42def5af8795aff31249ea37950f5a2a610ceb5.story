Josh Taylor and Charlie Flynn sealed double Commonwealth Games boxing gold for Scotland on an emotional final night of competition at the Hydro in Glasgow.

Gutsy Flynn saw off Northern Ireland's Joe Fitzpatrick to clinch the lightweight title and Taylor followed him into the ring to beat Namibian Junias Jonas and triumph at light-welterweight.

Taylor could hardly hold himself together as 'Flower Of Scotland' blared out back-to-back in the cavernous 20,000-capacity arena.

For the Prestonpans fighter it more than made up for his London 2012 heartbreak when he became the first Great Britain fighter to exit the competition.

Taylor, who had won a silver medal in Delhi four years ago, said: 'I almost couldn't sing it, I couldn't hold my emotions together

'Tears of joy, not tears of disappointment this time, thank God. I imagined it being amazing and everybody singing, but that was just surreal. It was a thousand times better.

'I could only sing it in bits because I would have broken down in tears. My body feels numb right now, I can't believe it.'

The 20-year-old Flynn rose to the occasion once again to keep the rangier Fitzpatrick at bay and seal the finest moment of his boxing career.

Flynn produced another heroic performance to match his come-from-behind victory over fancied Welshman Joe Cordina in the previous round.

Flynn, who jumped onto a corner post in celebration at the final bell, looked overwhelmed when the decision was announced.

The Motherwell boxer said he was 'buzzing like a jar of wasps' after the victory and the experience of fighting in front of such a big home crowd.

'The roar was unbelievable,' he said. 'It was silence, bang, the shot lands and you just hear it echoing up and up and up. It was like a thunderstorm, a volcano.

'You feel it in your chest when you're in there, roaring in your chest.'

England's Qais Ashfaq made a good start in his bantamweight final against Northern Ireland's Michael Conlan but was outpointed by the Olympic bronze medallist.

Defiant Ashfaq said: 'I know for a fact that on my day I could beat him. Next for me is the Worlds, the Europeans and then next year Olympic qualifiers.

'I'm still learning and still young - it's been an amazing experience.'
