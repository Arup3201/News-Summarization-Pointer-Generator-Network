Decision: Banbury Town Council is planning to spend up to £10,000 on a replica chain to protect the current regalia, pictured here being worn by the mayor, Councillor Tony Ilott

Leaders of a cash-strapped council have been criticised for planning to splash up to £10,000 of taxpayers' money on a fake chain for the town mayor.

Conservative-run Banbury Town Council is planning to fork out the money for the replica ceremonial chain to protect the current 'irreplaceable' gold regalia from getting damaged or lost.

The mayor's current chain is worth £25,000 and taxpayers have been left baffled at the decision to spend so much on a fake version, having managed with the current one for 140 years.

Councillor Tony Ilott would don the new gold-plated ceremonial wear for 'out-of-hours' engagements such as public appearances and charity events across the Oxfordshire town, if it is bought.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance today branded the move 'ridiculous'.

He said: 'Banbury residents will be staggered that town council leaders think that now is the right time to buy a replica chain, after presumably coping without one for nearly 140 years.

'£10,000 is an eye-wateringly large sum to spend on such frippery when budgets are so tight.

'Anyone spending taxpayers' money needs to ensure that they are delivering value with every penny in the budget and after this ridiculous waste of money Banbury residents will seriously question the town council's sense of priorities.' 

Councillor Ilott said although no money had yet been spent, the council had decided to get quotes to see how much the replica would cost.

He said: 'The council wanted to go and get three quotes. We could, if we wanted to, spend up to £10,000 without bringing it back to the council.'

He said the council was still waiting for the third quote.

He said: 'When we get the third quote it will go back to the committee who will then make a decision on whether or not we go along with it, but we haven't spent a single penny yet.'

Labour group leader Steve Kilsby said his party regretted backing the decision, which was made last year.

Cllr Kilsby said: 'My feeling is if the Labour group had looked at this again we probably would have voted differently.'

While
fellow Labour councillor Sean Woodcock, who represents the Banbury 
Ruscote ward, added: 'We're seeing here how the council is struggling to
balance budgets and my concern is whether this is the right time to be 
spending a lot of money on a piece of fake regalia.'

Labour
councillor Patrick Cartledge said: 'We understand that the last thing 
people want to see in these hard times is money spent on putting a chain
around someone's neck.'

Defence: Council leader Councillor Kieron Mallon has defended the decision, saying it went through full council meetings and opposition had only recently arisen

Locals in the small market town also expressed their disbelief at the 'waste' of taxpayers' money.

Mechanic
and father-of-four Brian Galloway, 50, said: 'There are dozens of other
issues that need addressing in this town that money should be spent on 
rather than something which is there for vanity reasons.

'I cannot believe this decision. It's not even that much cheaper than the real one.'

Council leader Councillor Kieron Mallon has defended the decision.

He said: 'Our civic regalia is irreplaceable.

'The chain dates to 1874. If you compare it to other towns it is second to none.

'Without cutting anything else from the budget and without raising council tax, we decided to look at the possibility of creating a replica.

'That went through the full council meetings and there was no opposition until now.'
