For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp explores the decline of English managers in the modern game. 

Louis van Gaal couldn’t have done a better job with Hull City than Steve Bruce did last year. Yet did his heroics in the League and FA Cup create even a ripple at Old Trafford? Was Steve, a great competitor and wonderful player for United, even considered for the Manchester United job?

OK, a few times in his career it hasn’t worked out but that would be true of Van Gaal, too, if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town or Hull.

I don’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in British managers. Unless Frank Lampard or John Terry gets the job, do you really see Roman Abramovich appointing an Englishman to Chelsea? Or even a British manager? Maybe Brendan Rodgers might come into the frame, but would he leave Liverpool for Stamford Bridge?

Foreign players, foreign coaches, foreign owners.

I’ve got a great relationship with the Queens Park Rangers owner Tony Fernandes — and I’m too old to be a creep, so believe me, I mean it — but not every manager is as lucky. Club chairmen talk to current players, they talk to ex-players, they talk to agents, to a ring of yes-men — and then they come away thinking they know more than the manager.

Sometimes a foreign coach gets the benefit of the doubt, but British managers are increasingly coming under particularly harsh scrutiny.

I don’t see the new breed of owner — with their ‘keep throwing money at it and eventually you’ll be all right’ approach — giving British coaches a chance. It was a real setback that David Moyes did not do better at Manchester United, although it was always going to be hard to be the man who followed Sir Alex Ferguson.

And where’s the next generation of English managers coming from? Will the current top tier of English players go through the leagues to prove themselves, as Bruce has done?

Lads who have had 10 seasons at Chelsea in the Abramovich years won’t get out of bed for what the manager of Exeter City gets paid. Take Lampard. Now he’s finished at Chelsea, would he really want to take a job at, say, Gillingham, the way I worked at Bournemouth? He probably earned three times as much in one week as the Gillingham manager does in one year.

Will Frank Lampard want to drop down the divisions as a manager when he hangs up his boots for good?

Let’s face it, if you’ve been earning £200,000 a week, are you going to take a job for £80,000 a year that involves going out every night watching inferior games and inferior players on the off-chance of finding a gem?

I greatly admire anyone from the modern generation who fancies putting themselves through that.

I’ve been around plenty of Premier League dressing-rooms and I don’t hear many players talk about watching matches from the lower leagues. I don’t see guys like Sol Campbell rushing to take a post in the lower divisions, though I hear he is doing his coaching badges and I’d like to see him get into it.

Ryan Giggs has gone into coaching, but it was never even considered that he might follow the Bobby Charlton route and end up at Preston. It was always going to be at Manchester United or nothing. If Stockport County had phoned him I think it would have been the shortest conversation of all time.

So Giggs has not taken that risk. Why would he test himself against a guy like Steve Evans at Rotherham United? Evans will never get a Premier League job, but his record as a lower-division manager is outstanding.

He gets in a lot of trouble over his comments to referees and officials, but he has proven himself a promotion expert with both Crawley Town and Rotherham in recent seasons. Would Giggs know what he was doing in a lower division up against him? Evans knows where to look for players, he’s out grafting all the time and he knows how to put a League Two or League One team together. Giggs wouldn’t have a clue by comparison.

The modern players are as likely to want to be media men or agents as run a team, and I don’t blame them.

Roy Keane is working in the game at Aston Villa and Ireland, but it seems a real shame to have a man of his stature outside United. Would they have come seventh last season if Keane had been around to pull the players up?

He would have been after them as he always was in the peak years, when there were no short-cuts at United and those messages were passed from Sir Alex, through Keane.

There is a story of him laying into Mark Bosnich, the goalkeeper, for turning up late on his first day of training. Bosnich said he’d got lost. Keane’s point was that on his own first day at the club, he got up early, hired a taxi and followed it to the training ground in his car to ensure he arrived on time.

He had incredible professional standards and expected the same of everybody. It’s great to have a player like that in your team. Every manager wants a Tony Adams, a John Terry or a Roy Keane, a player who will have a go. I know Roy had a reputation for being high maintenance but I never found him that way. He was as good as gold as a manager and if you asked him about players you always got excellent, straight opinions.

Terry is another influential player. He’s one of those that change a club. If we could take him to QPR from Chelsea I would feel very confident, just with that one signing alone, that we would stay up.

He gets people at it, he’s a talker, he takes charge of the dressing-room. It’s hard to find leaders, though I’m lucky enough to have Rio Ferdinand with me. It’s hard to find talkers, organisers. I don’t know why, but it is so hard to find a player prepared to speak his mind.

Everyone now is waiting to receive information; they all exist in their own little worlds. They don’t talk to each other off the pitch or on the coach.

Everyone sits there with headphones, looking at an iPad or playing a computer game. Is it any wonder modern players lack communication skills?

Terry is the modern day Tony Adams and a throwback in the way he bosses his team

Terry is a throwback in the way he bosses a team. I’ve got a lot of time for John, even though I know his career has not been without controversy. The modern Tony Adams — I can’t pay him a higher compliment than that.

Some people may think John is a dubious role model, but I would have no hesitation in saying to any of the young academy defenders at QPR: ‘Go and watch Chelsea tonight, go and watch Terry, study him all game’.

If they pay attention they will learn more in that 90 minutes than in a month of training sessions.

If Chelsea ever lose faith in John, I’d take him like a shot.
