The Moroccan woman at the centre of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi's sex-for-hire trial arrived in court to testify as a witness today - only to learn that the trial did not need to hear her testimony. 

Karima el-Mahroug, 19, was ordered by the court to appear after failing to show on two previous dates, reportedly because she was in Mexico on holiday.

Better known as 'Ruby the heartstealer,' she had been called as a defence witness at the trial in Milan, which Berlusconi had wanted delayed in case it affected his re-election chances.

His Lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said Berlusconi would be too busy campaigning for the February election to attend court, but judges rejected the application.

Berlusconi, 76, is accused of paying for sex with el-Mahroug when she was 17, and then trying to cover it up. Both deny sexual contact.

The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman for sex under the age of 18 is a crime.

Prosecutors claim he had sex with her 13 times.

Order: El-Mahroug was ordered by the court to appear to testify after failing to show on two previous dates because she was reportedly in Mexico on vacation

El-Mahroug was the last witness due to testify, meaning that a verdict could come before the Feb. 24-25 elections in which Berlusconi is heading a center-right coalition.

She looked relaxed, chatting with her lawyer, and wore a dark parka with fur trim and carried a Louis Vuitton handbag.

Berlusconi went on trial in 2011 over the sex allegations, which focus on a series of parties he is said to have thrown at his luxury villa at Arcore near Milan.

Showgirls and wannabe starlets allegedly performed erotic dances for him and were paid with cars, cash and jewellery.

Both
he and Miss El Mahroug deny any wrongdoing, although the teenager is 
said to have boasted to friends that Berlusconi gave her several 
thousand euros for attending the parties and that he was besotted with 
her.

Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute

Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76,  of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug
in 2010 when she was 17

The former cruise ship crooner-turned-politician has fought numerous legal battles in his 20-year career and two months ago he was convicted of fraud.

However, he has insisted all the trials he has faced are politically motivated and he is innocent of all accusations.

If convicted of having sex with an 
underage prostitute, Berlusconi faces a three-year jail sentence. He is 
also on trial for abuse of office after prosecutors said he lied to 
cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested for theft - wrongly 
telling police she was related to then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak 
and should be freed.

Last week Berlusconi has labelled judges who ordered him to pay his ex-wife £29 million a year in a divorce settlement as 'feminists and communists'.

Joke: He insisted that the expression bunga-bunga to refer to alleged sex parties at his villa in Sardinia, came from a joke

Berlucsoni lashed out during a TV interview in his first public comments on the decision which emerged last month.

The ruling works out at £82,000 a day, four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion.

Last month Berlusconi announced his engagement to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.

His new partner is TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 27, who has been at his side constantly in recent weeks since he announced he would be running in next February’s General Election.

He made the revelation during a long and wide-ranging interview on one of his numerous TV stations - and it came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife Veronica Lario.

Berlusconi also spoke of his ongoing trial which is centred on his infamous bunga bunga parties and again insisted nothing untoward took place at the evenings in his villa at Arcore near Milan.

He said: 'There was nothing illegal going on, they were just elegant dinners. It was a particular moment for me, I had just announced my divorce, my mother and my sister had just died.

'I would go home and there was no-one there, I felt sad.'

But Berlusconi hit back at judges and prosecutors in Milan where the case is being heard, once again insisting they were politically led and out to get him.

He said: 'I have fallen into their trap, it’s been built up by the judiciary. The trial is just an incredible machination.

'It was an excuse they needed to hit me with a massive defamation operation against me and my government which had international implications.'

He added: 'In a twenty year political career you get used to all sorts of insults. But there is something that before God smells of a vendetta.

'I have been convicted to four years in jail by a court in Milan who accused me of being behind a system that saved me three million euros a year but at the same time I paid 570million euros in taxes.'

In a 120-minute interview on his Canale 5 station with host Barbara D’Urso, Berlusconi also explained why he was running for prime minister a year after being forced out of office.

He said: 'We are in the same situation as 1994 - if I don’t run then the Left will get in. We cannot run the risk of them winning.'

Despite his boasts commentators see a win for Berlusconi as unlikely given that his party is trailing third in the polls with around 20 percent of the vote, with Democratic Left leader Pier Luigi Bersani the favourite to win.

Berlusconi’s appearance on the show unleashed a storm of protest on the internet, with many expressing anger at what they described as an 'obvious and concrete example of a conflict of interest.'
