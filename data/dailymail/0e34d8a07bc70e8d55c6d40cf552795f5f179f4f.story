A window cleaner has accused parking bosses of trying to 'milk people of every penny' after a traffic warden gave him a fine because his van was hanging one inch over yellow lines.

Andrew Wilson, 50, has been left livid after the jobsworth official slapped a £70 ticket on his van which he parked on his driveway at his home in Lincoln.

Ironically, the double yellow lines are intended to stop other motorists blocking his way out.

Livid: Window cleaner Andrew Wilson was given a £70 parking fine because his van was overhanging yellow lines by one inch

'Milking it': The van was parked near the end of the driveway because of building work going on at a neighbour's property

Mr Wilson has been unable to pull any further onto his drive because of building work being carried out on a neighbour's property.

But he said the female traffic warden would not listen to reason when he explained.

'I went out ranting and raving and saying 'what are you doing?' he said.

'There was about three or four people in our street shouting at her. She said there was nothing she could do about it.

Action: Mr Wilson has accused the council of trying to 'milk people of every penny' and says he will fight the parking ticket

'I said 'you can see the driveway, I can't use it' and she just walked off. The wheels are on my drive but the tiniest part of the vehicle is overhanging the lines.

'I would say it was hanging maybe half way over the first yellow line, probably only two centimetres.

'The warden must have got a ruler out and measured just how far over the line I was.

'The galling thing is the lines are there to stop my and other people's cars being blocked in by other people.'

Andrew, who lives with his wife Keely, 39, and daughter Shania, 13, slammed Lincolnshire County Council for 'milking people of every penny' and vowed to appeal the fine.

'It's a £70 fine but if you pay it in 14
days then it's £35. I'm not going to pay it. I've appealed against it 
and sent the photos I took.

'I have been living here for three and a half years and the yellow lines have always been there but I've never had a problem.

'After 6pm you don't need a permit so the traffic wardens are always down there at like 5.30pm trying to catch people out.

'I've seen them scraping the ice off trying to look for permits.

'It is just stupid. It is milking us for every penny we have. It is disgusting.'

Mick Phoenix, parking services manager for Lincolnshire County Council, said: 'Mr Wilson has appealed against his ticket, so we will be investigating this. This will involve comparing any notes or photos taken by the parking officer with the evidence supplied by Mr Wilson.

'We usually have a decision in around 14 working days.The parking officers are asked to take a common sense approach when issuing a ticket. If we find Mr Wilson has been penalised in error, we will, of course cancel his ticket. However, if the ticket is upheld, there is option to reappeal.'

Reason: Andrew Wilson said he tried to explain to the female warden that he couldn't move his van any further down the drive because of building work but his words fell on deaf ears
