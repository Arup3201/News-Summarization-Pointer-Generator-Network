A windsurfer was pulled dead from the water after onlookers today spotted his equipment in the sea near Portsmouth.

The alarm was raised at 12.15pm after a dinghy spotted windsurfing gear in water just outside Langstone Harbour.

The Hayling Island Coastguard Rescue Team, the Coastguard helicopter from Lee-on-the-Solent, three RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene, along with police and ambulance crews.

A man was later found face down in the water and was pulled onto a boat and taken to the shore.

The man was then flown by the Coastguard helicopter to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Portsmouth, where he was pronounced dead. 

The man's name is yet to be released.

A spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said very little was known about the circumstances leading to the man's death, other than the fact he was windsurfing with a friend at the time.

She said the conditions were not unlikely to be a factor in the death as wind gusts had been mild in the area.
