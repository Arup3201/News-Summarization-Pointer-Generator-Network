Maggie Rizer and her husband Alex Mehran have welcomed their third child - a baby girl named Cecilia.

The supermodel, 37, announced the happy news on her Instagram page this morning with a photo of herself cradling the newborn.

In a heartfelt post, she wrote: 'We are so proud to welcome our daughter, Cecilia Kathryn Mehran. Named for two angels and the Patron Saint of music, heaven is surely filled with the most beautiful singing today.'

Cecilia is the first daughter for the couple who already have two young sons - Zander, three, and Quinn, who turns two in March.

Ms Rizer, who now rarely models but remains in demand, despite having moved to San Francisco for her husband's work, was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show.

Though her pregnancy was not public knowledge at the time, she would have been four months' pregnant - a point at which most expectant women will start to show a small bump.

Where did it go? Ms Rizer, pictured on her birthday in January with her husband and eldest son, didn't even look pregnant in this front-on snap, despite being eight months pregnant

But photos from Ms Rizer's Instagram show that she has remained supermodel slim throughout this pregnancy. In one photograph with her husband and son Zander, she does not even appear to be pregnant, although from the side it is clear that she has a sizeable bump.

Ms Rizer, who originally hails from New York State, was one of the world's most popular models in the late Nineties and early 2000's.

She stopped modeling in 2004 after it emerged that her stepfather, John Breen, who had been handling her finances, gambled away her entire fortune. Her professional earnings alone were estimated to be over $7million, though she also lost inheritance left by her biological father, Kevin Rizer, after his death from AIDS when she was 14.

Since the loss of her father - her parents divorced when she was a baby when Kevin announced that he was gay - the model has been a staunch AIDS awareness activist.

These days, Ms Rizer says ordinary life holds far more appeal than fashion. In an interview with Refinery 29 in late 2012, she said she says she loves the 'civilised' Bay Area lifestyle with its 'BBQs, normal work hours, cars to transport you instead of cabs.'

She even finds it hard to acknowledge her former fame: 'I get a lot of, "Do people ever tell you that you look exactly like Maggie Rizer?" And I give a lot of, "Thanks, I hear that a lot." I'm not good at owning up to it.' 

On her children, she said: 'I think there's something so special about having a sibling very close in age to you...' she says. I imagine they will play together, have the same friends, build forts together...

'There's nothing better that I can imagine then being 90 years old with Alex and having five kids, 25 grandchildren, and a zillion great-grandchildren to follow. And five or six golden retrievers at our feet.'
