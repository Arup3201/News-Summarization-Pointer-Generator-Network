Governor Andrew Cuomo is coming under fire after saying that Hurricane Sandy was 'more impactful' than Hurricane Katrina, even though the 2005 storm still caused significantly more deaths.

The New York governor ignored the staggering different death tolls- Hurricane Katrina caused 1,833 deaths while Sandy is attributed in 121 deaths- but went on to say that last month's hurricane 'affected many, many more people and places than Katrina'.

He broached the controversial topic during a press conference on Monday while explaining his rationale in asking for nearly $42billion in federal aid for the reconstruction process.

New York's demands raise the total estimates for the storm's damage, as all of the affected East Coast states combined now require at least $71,3billion.

The total, which is substantially larger than previous estimates of $50billion and could still grow, came as Cuomo laid out his state's needs.

He said that their total of $41.9billion is made up of including $32.8billion to repair and restore damaged housing, parks and infrastructure and to cover lost revenue and other expenses, as well as $9.1billion to mitigate potential damage from future severe weather events.

As many are still grappling with the devastation from Hurricane Sandy, the governor's words appeared callous to some Twitter users.

'Human life trumps property. How did you miss that?' wrote Vanessa Robinson. Another man, identified only as Mitch G, said that it was just an example of Cuomo being a politician:

'Of course Sandy was worse than Katrina for Governor Cuomo, because it was his state that got hit this time.'

Ben White, an economic reporter at Politico, wrote 'slow your roll, gov' when he retweeted the news on his personal Twitter account while his co-worker Maggie Haberman wrote 'seems like this isn't wise'.

While Sandy may have damaged more homes and businesses, Katrina took a far greater toll on human lives, killing more than 1,800 people directly or indirectly. Sandy, by comparison, is believed to have killed at least 121 people.

'Hurricane Katrina got a lot of notoriety for the way government handled -- or mishandled, depending on your point of view -- the situation,' Cuomo said at a press conference.

'But considering the dense population of the area Sandy impacted and costs to the economy, housing, and businesses, the damage done 'was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than inHurricane Katrina, and that puts this entire conversation, I believe, in focus,' Cuomo said.

Neighboring New Jersey, which saw massive damage to its transit system and coastline, suffered at least $29.4billion in overall losses, according to a preliminary analysis released by Governor Chris Christie's office Friday.

The preliminary cost estimate includes federal aid New Jersey has received so far.

By some measures, Sandy was worse than Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which tore into the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, Cuomo said.

Sandy destroyed 305,000 houses in New York state - a still provisional number that's likely to grow - compared to the 214,700 destroyed in Louisiana by Katrina and Rita.

Sandy also caused nearly 2.2 million power outages at its peak in the state, compared to 800,000 from Katrina and Rita in Louisiana, and impacted 265,300 businesses compared to 18,700, Cuomo said.

Hurricane Sandy hit relatively late in the season, touching ground on October 27. Hurricane Katrina hit the Southwest in the last week of August, 2005, and was followed just a few weeks later by Hurricane Rita. Because Rita came so quickly after Katrina, it's wrath further hindered the reconstruction from Katrina so many of their official damage totals have been grouped together.

COST OF RECOVERY: The latest government estimates place the total cost of Hurricane Sandy recovery at $71billion covering all of the damaged areas, while Hurricane Katrina and Rita retain their position as the costliest hurricane in U.S. history tallying up to $108billion.

DEATHS: There is no comparison in this category, as 121 people died as a result of Sandy, which is just six per cent of the 1,833 lives lost in the 2005 storms.Â 

HOMES DESTROYED: Cuomo's main talking point is that the structural damage that was caused by Sandy was more expansive than Katrina and Rita, and the numbers support that theory. Sandy is cited for the destruction of 305,000 versus the 214,700 caused by Katrina and Rita.

BUSINESSES IMPACTED: The dense nature of the impact area of Sandy resulted in 265,300 businesses being affected as compared to 18,700 in 2005.

POWER OUTAGES: While most of Manhattan got their power back four days after the storm, thousands remain without power exactly one month on. There were 2,190,000 reported outages this year as compared to the 18,700 from Katrina and Rita.

Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on October 29, blasting through the Northeastern U.S., devastating homes, forcing evacuations, crippling power systems and shutting down New York City's subway system for days.

The total cost to the region is still not known as estimates of the damage, as well as future repair and prevention costs, continue to come in from all levels of government.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday he will ask Congress for $9.8billion to pay for Sandy costs not covered by insurance or other federal funds.

In a letter to New York's congressional delegation, Bloomberg said public, private and indirect losses to the city from the devastating late-October storm stood at $19billion.

Of that, private insurance is expected to cover $3.8billion, with Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements to cover at least an additional $5.4billion, Bloomberg said in a statement.

The city still will need the additional $9.8billion to help pay for costs that FEMA does not cover, like hazard mitigation, long-term housing, shoreline restoration and protection efforts, he said.

Whatever the final tally, officials are beginning to pressure Congress for federal assistance.

Cuomo met on Monday with the state's Congressional delegation and county officials. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in a statement that New York's Congressional delegation will push hard for additional federal funding.

'The federal government has a clear responsibility to commit all of the necessary resources to help us rebuild,' she said.

Getting federal funds could be a tough fight, because of pressure on lawmakers to cut spending and raise taxes in order to shrink the federal deficit.

'This will be an effort that lasts not weeks, but many months, and we will not rest until the federal response meets New York's deep and extensive needs,' said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer in a statement.

Cuomo's earlier estimates had pegged the total amount of damages for the region at $50billion, with about $33billion of that incurred in New York state.

In New York City, Bloomberg said on Monday they had about $4.8billion of uninsured private losses, $3.8billion of insured private losses, and $4.5billion in losses to city agencies.

Reconstructing the city's damaged roads alone could cost nearly $800million, Bloomberg said. New York City, a financial and tourism center, also lost about $5.7billion in gross city product, he added,

Included in Cuomo's nearly $9.1billion of mitigation costs are what he called 'common sense' actions, like flood protection for the World Trade Center site, roads, subway tunnels and sewage treatment plants, as well as power generators for the region's fuel supply system and backup power for health care facilities.

'We will see new projects,' said Mysore Nagaraja, former president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Construction Co.
