Glow giver: Dr Harold Lancer is Hollywood's favourite dermatologist and the secret behind Kim Kardashian's flawless complexion. The skincare guru has shared his tips for getting glowing skin with MailOnline

As he launches his new book, Younger, Dr Lancer shares the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his A-list clients with MailOnline.

'I prescribe the Lancer Three-Step Method - step one, polish; step two, cleanse; step three, nourish - to all of my patients, regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics', he said.

Dr Lancer says method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) to the epidermis (the outermost layer).

'Dermis-focused skin care regimes are not effective because the ingredients, no matter how therapeutic, are not able to reach the dermis. Instead, the skin must be stimulated to repair itself,' he said.

The Lancer Method reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing, or exfoliation, followed by cleansing, and then nourishing. He believes that by polishing first, the result is a deeper cleanse, a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal.

'Say, for example, you wanted to replace a tile floor. If your epidermis is the floor, then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old, worn out tiles. Next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris, e.g. cleansing, and finally fresh tiles have to be laid, which represent the nourish step,' he said.

'Exfoliation creates a "controlled injury",' he explains. 'Gentle exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed, expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis.

'The controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process, giving skin a younger, fresher look.'

Famous fan: Victoria, 40, is a huge fan of Lancer Lift Serum Intense, which is described as 'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration'

The next step is cleansing, which, as most people know, helps you get rid of everything that you have loosened up by exfoliating.

This is followed by nourish, which delivers anti-oxidants, vitamins and other anti-ageing ingredients to the skin.

Kim is an everyday user of Dr Lancer’s three step Method, as is Victoria Beckham, who also loves his SPF and the Lift Serum Intense.

Victoria, 
40, uses the serum, which is described as 
'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up 
cellular regeneration'.

She goes there too! A-list actress Reese Witherspoon, 38, was seen leaving Dr Lancer's clinic recently

The
 luxury serum claims to boost the creation of collagen and new skin 
cells, as well as protect new cells from environmental aggravators.

However, 
Victoria's favourite serum doesn't come cheap. The 25ml bottle will set 
you back £230 - only the best for Mrs Beckham, right?

Two
 years ago Victoria was a frequent visitor for his facials derived 
from sheep placenta and gold flakes that are said to harness the power 
of the animal's stem cells. She has endorsed the LancerX website along
 with Ellen DeGeneres and Michelle Williams.

Just last month, Reese Witherspoon was seen leaving Dr Lancer's clinic in upmarket Rodeo Drive.

The skin expert's clients also include Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian, Renee Zellweger, Jessica Simpson and Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife, Denise Richards.
