Rick Santorum today revealed his sick three-year-old daughter ‘almost died’ at the weekend after she was hospitalised with pneumonia in both lungs, during what he described as a 'very hectic 36 hours'.

The GOP presidential candidate spent the weekend at ill Bella's bedside at home in Virginia and then at a Philadelphia hospital, leaving his eldest daughter Elizabeth to campaign on his behalf.

He was up with Bella for most of Friday night and fears were raised when she was taken to hospital on Saturday evening, but she was ‘alert and back to her own beautiful, happy girl’ by late Sunday.

‘A simple cold can kill her, and it 
almost did this weekend,’ Mr Santorum told Glenn Beck’s radio show on 
Monday, reported the Washington Post. ‘She ended up with pneumonia and a
cold.

‘But she was able to get great care 
and yesterday really made a great turn around. She will be out of the
ICU today and so we are getting back to normal here.’

The former Pennsylvania senator gave 
an update to Florida supporters by telephone from her hospital room on 
Sunday and said doctors hope she can go home in the next few days.

‘We're
going to get out on the campaign trail later tomorrow (Monday), heading
out to the Midwest, and start campaigning in the next states as we move
this campaign forward,’ he said.

Mr
Santorum scheduled a speech on Monday in Missouri and another event in 
Minnesota - two states with early February contests. He then planned to 
head to Colorado and Nevada for Tuesday.

‘I
feel very, very good about where we are and where the campaign is 
going,’ the candidate said, despite having to cancel an interview with 
NBC on Sunday and other appearances in Florida.

Bella
Santorum has a genetic condition known as Trisomy 18, which typically 
proves fatal. Her father has said in the past that his daughter wasn't 
expected to live past 12 months.

‘She
without a doubt has turned the corner,’ he said. But he cautioned she 
‘isn't out of the woods yet’, following his unexpected detour from the 
campaign just days before Tuesday's Florida primary.

Mr Santorum got to his home in 
Virginia around midnight on Friday for a quick break to do his taxes, 
but found his daughter 'was not doing well'. 'I was up with her a lot of
the night,' he said.

'By 
the end of the day, it was really, really clear she was struggling.’ Mr 
Santorum described the situation as providing a ‘very, very tough night' but said by late Sunday she was doing much better.

'It's been a very hectic 36 hours. Life in the Santorum family has dramatically improved since the late afternoon'

‘It's
been a very hectic 36 hours,’ Mr Santorum added on Sunday. ‘Life in the Santorum 
family has dramatically improved since the late afternoon.’ Bella 
remains in intensive care at a hospital in Philadelphia.

Her
father also told voters in Minnesota that she is ‘miraculously on the 
mend’, no longer in a ‘very dangerous’ situation and the family ‘dodged 
another bullet’, reported ABC News.

Meanwhile
Mr Santorum's eldest daughter Elizabeth Santorum, 20, took his place to
address supporters in a hangar at Sarasota Bradenton International 
Airport in Florida.

'You 
know we do what we do as a family,’ Ms Santorum said on Sunday. ‘You 
know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in
there.'

Trisomy 18 is caused by the 
presence of all or part of an extra 18th chromosome. Mr Santorum has 
previously said he often has to catch himself to stop from tears when 
talking or thinking about Bella.

'I
have a little girl who's three-and-a-half years old,' he said in Iowa 
before winning the caucus contest there earlier this month. 'I don't know whether her life 
is going to be measured in days and weeks.

'You know we do what we do as a family. You know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in there'

‘Yet
here I am... because I feel like I wouldn't be a good dad if I wasn't 
out here fighting for a country that would see the dignity in her and 
every other child.'

He calls
the choice to campaign 'gut-retching' but wants to fight for special 
needs families. 'You think she's fine, and then one cold and she's this 
close to dying,' he told the Washington Post last year.

In
October, he missed one of Bella's surgeries to participate in a debate 
and told the audience that he planned to take an all-night flight home 
from Las Vegas, Nevada, to be with her.

'I
look at the simplicity and love she emits,' Mr Santorum said in a web 
video his campaign released after his scheduling drew questions, 'and 
it's clear to me we're the disabled ones.'

Mr Santorum has largely kept his daughter off the campaign schedules, preferring her to stay home with her mother. But Bella did join Mr Santorum for a few days around Iowa's straw poll in August.

She also joined her family in Charleston, South Carolina, on the day of its primary. Mr Santorum's rivals for the White House all sent their well-wishes to his young daughter and the Santorum family.

Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development.

Described as a relatively common condition, it occurs in about one out of 3,000 live births, killing half of those within their first week.

Those who have survived into their teenage years suffer from serious medical and developmental problems including clenched hands, mental deficiency, a small head or jaw and heart defects.

A small number of adults with the condition make it to their twenties or thirties while always requiring assisted caregiving.

Republican presidential primary 
frontrunner Mitt Romney told Fox News: '(My wife) Ann and I send prayers
and best wishes for Bella's good health to Rick and Karen Santorum and 
their entire family.'

Asked 
whether he had a conversation with the Senator about dropping out of the
race, Newt Gingrich told reporters that ‘this would be a totally 
inappropriate time to do anything like that’.

'Rick's
going to get a decent vote tomorrow - on Tuesday - I have no doubt the 
two of us are going to collectively outscore Romney,’ he said. ‘And at 
that point it might be a pretty good conversation.'

President Barack Obama's adviser David Axelrod also offered his thoughts to the Santorum family.

'Let
me also add my prayers and thoughts for Senator Santorum and his child.
I have gone through problems with a child and my heart goes out to him 
and his family,' Mr Axelrod told MSNBC.

Mr
Axelrod's daughter had brain damage from a series of epileptic seizures
as an infant.  Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and former
presidential candidate Rick Perry also offered support.

'Thank
you, Rick and Karen Santorum, for living the Christ-like example of 
sacrifice and right priorities,’ said Mrs Palin, 
writing on Facebook on behalf of her family.

'Nothing
is more precious or important than the life of an innocent child,' she added. 'Our 
prayers are with Bella, a perfect child in an imperfect world. God bless
the beautiful Santorum family.'
