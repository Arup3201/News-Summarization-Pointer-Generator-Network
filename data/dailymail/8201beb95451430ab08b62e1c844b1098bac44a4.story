There are already shrines somewhere in the world for taps, lunchboxes, lawnmowers, carrots and even salt and pepper shakers - but one household item more important than all of those had been shamefully overlooked.

Until now.

The world's first 'toilet theme park' has opened in Korea, a bizarre homage to indoor sanitation and everything we put into it.

The 'Restroom Cultural Park' in Suwon has been opened in memory and tribute to former mayor Sim Jae-Duck, affectionately known as 'Mr Toilet', who campaigned his entire life to improve Korea's often antiquated public conveniences.

The Stinker? This thoughtful character is one of many toilet-related statues around the museum

Shrine to the throne: This is the toilet-shaped house belonging to Suwon's former mayor Sim Jae-Duck which has been converted into the world's first toilet theme park

Honour: Sim Jae-Duck devoted his life to improving the state of public toilets in Korea and founded the World Toilet Association

And this extraordinary place reflects everything he achieved - and it certainly seems Korea takes after Britain in terms of 'toilet humour.'

From the bronze statues of people sitting on the toilet dotted around outside, to the converted toilet-shaped house which contains an exhibition on toilets through the ages, everything here is themed after one thing. 

There is even a room devoted to toilet-related art - fitting in a city which holds the annual Golden Poop art festival.

It might not seem like the most attractive tourist destination, but Lee Youn-Souk, who works at the park, thinks differently.

She told the BBC: 'We just focus on eating everyday, we sometimes overlook the importance of the toilet.

'We already know upon waking up in the morning we should go to the toilet but people don't want to talk about this.

'So we wanted to demonstrate to the public out 'toilet culture'. The toilet is not just a toilet, it can be a cultural space.

'[They are] so important for health, sanitation and water conservation.'

Mr Jae-Duck agreed - he was reportedly born in his grandmother's WC, as this apparently brings good luck, and spent much of his working life trying to improve facilities.

He founded the World Toilet Association and unveiled his impressive toilet-shaped house on the eve of the organisation's first General Assembly meeting in 2002.

The people of Suwon take great pride in them too and some are even tourist spots. They also stumped up the cash so his £1.2m toilet-shaped house could be converted into a theme park after his death.

Time will tell if it becomes a must-visit destination.
