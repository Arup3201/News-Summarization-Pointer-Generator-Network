Adolf Hitler's 1923 racist manifesto Mein Kampf consistently tops lists of bestselling ebooks and a new essay suggests that's become of its similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey.

Chris Faraone argues that Hitler's argument outlining a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, which sees little in the way of hardcopy sales, is perfect for the more discrete and disposable world of digital books.

Like erotica and romance novels, writes Faraone, readers who would otherwise be embarrassed may anonymously buy a copy of the text and stay under the radar while using an e-reader.

Strange parallel: A recent essay suggests that the years-long popularity of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf is akin to the success of erotica and romance ebooks

Taboo subjects: There are many digital English translation versions of Hitler's racist manifesto. One was recently on top of Amazon's best selling Propaganda & Political Psychology. Others versions continuously hover on other Amazon and iTunes bestseller lists

One version of the manifesto tops Amazon's list of most downloaded Propaganda & Political Psychology books. Two others hovered on the iTunes Politics & Current Events list.

'Mein Kampf could be following a similar trend to that of smut and romance novels,' Faraone writes, which may both 'be quietly perused then dropped into a folder or deleted.'

The success of 50 Shades of Grey, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear.

While Mein Kampf isn't as popular as the E. L. James novel, it is much cheaper.

While
 an iTunes copy of Fifty Shades costs $4.99, a Kindle edition of Mein 
Kampf--which translates to My Struggle--can be had for just 99 cents.

According
 to Faraone, Men Kampf's electronic success has been worldwide and 
follows its hardcover popularity in India, where it has sold 100,000 
copies since 2005.

In 2005, he writes, a Turkish translation sold that many copies in just two months.

Whether
 hardcover or ebook edition, Faraone suggests it is curiosity about a 
taboo book that is at the core of the books continued sales.

While generally derided as the ravings of a genocidal anti-Semite, Mein Kampf retains its appeal for some because of its historical importance. As an ebook, readers are apparently able to inulge their curiosity without having to keep the taboo tome on a shelf or be seen reading it in public
