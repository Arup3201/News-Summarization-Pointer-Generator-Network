The new host of Newsnight Evan Davis has revealed he tears up at the sight of thousands of migrants who have set up camp in Calais in the hope of gaining entry to the UK. 

Mr Davis, who has a holiday home in Normandy, said driving past the desperate crowds of foreigners, most of whom have travelled to France from north Africa, makes him emotional.

The journalist's comments come as he prepares to host the BBC Two current affairs programme for the first time on Monday.

The former BBC Radio 4 host said he often cries and that travelling to and from his second home in Normandy past the migrants in Calais made him emotional 

Speaking about his tendency to cry, the 52-year-old said he 'couldn't bear' to think about getting emotional while on air, but broke down during an interview when asked about migrants in Calais. 

Thousands have set up camp in the French coastal town in desperate bids to gain entry to the UK by storming ferries preparing to cross the Channel. 

Mr Davis said seeing their makeshift tents and pleading signs begging for human rights makes him cry whenever he takes the Channel crossing to visit his second home in Normandy.

Security measures have been considered to control the swelling crowds of migrants who have jumped on to lorries and hidden themselves in cars to make the crossing between France and England  

Mr Davis, who has never presented live television before, added he wanted to introduce a softer tone to the late-night programme. 

'As a political value, I have a deep-rooted belief about the world that I don't want alpha males making all the decisions,' he told the Sunday Times Magazine.

'I would like more thoughtful people to have a bit more of a say over things,' he said.
