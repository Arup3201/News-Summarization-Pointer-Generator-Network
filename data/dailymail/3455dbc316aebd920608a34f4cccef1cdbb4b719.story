Sean Abbott took two wickets in as many overs for New South Wales on his return to cricket for the first time since the death of Phillip Hughes.

The 22-year-old was made to wait until his 10th over before picking up a scalp, but then sent Nathan Reardon and Ben Cutting on their way in back-to-back overs.

Abbott also delivered a bouncer in his first over during the opening session of New South Wales' Sheffield Shield clash against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Abbott received a warm round of applause from the crowd when he was introduced into the attack in the 13th over in his first outing since Hughes' death.

Hughes was killed after being struck by an Abbott bouncer at the same ground two weeks ago.

After four dot balls in his first over, the 22-year-old delivered a short ball with his fifth delivery that sailed well over Queensland batsman Joe Burns' head.

New South Wales paid tribute to their former team-mates by wearing black armbands and 'PJH 707' on their shirts, a reference to Hughes being the state's 707th representative. 

Queensland made a strong start at the Sydney Cricket Ground as they moves to 105 for one, but the hosts fought back to bowl them out for 268.

New South Wales closed the day on 17 for one in their reply.
