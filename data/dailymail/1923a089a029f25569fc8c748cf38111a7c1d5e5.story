A Florida state trooper has offered roadside assistance of a different kind - saving a mother who was choking on a seatbelt that was placed around her neck by her 3-year-old daughter.

Trooper Brad Wagner was flagged down on the Suncoast Parkway in Pasco County and asked to help the 37-year-old who was choking after the safety device locked around her neck. It was the second life threatening situation Wagner was called to in the past three months. 

The woman, her husband and their daughter were returning home after having Thanksgiving dinner with their family on Thursday when the incident happened.

Florida state trooper Brad Wagner saved the life of a 37-year-old woman who was choking after her three-year-old daughter wrapped a seat belt around her neck during an argument over using a child seat

According to the New York Daily News  the couple's daughter refused to sit in the child seat and placed the seat belt around her mother. The seatbelt then became entangled around her throat and she began to choke.

Police said when her husband tried to remove it, the device became tighter again. 

The woman, who declined to give her name, told local media: 'He's pulling on it, but this thing would not give. I was panicking, and it kept getting tighter. Then, that was it. At that point, it just got so bad. I blacked out at that point.'

The woman was nearly unconscious when Wagner used his knife to free her from the seat belt.
