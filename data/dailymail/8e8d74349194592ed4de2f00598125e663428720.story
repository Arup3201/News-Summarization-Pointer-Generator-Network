A cheeky raccoon proved it was too curious for its own good - after it got its head stuck in a drain cover.

The black and white creature was found with its head stuck in the metal grate and was unable to get out, despite its desperate attempts free itself.

Experts from the Wildlife Emergency Services (WES) near Santa Cruz, California, were called on to assist the poor animal.

The raccoon was safely sedated before officials got to work freeing the animal. Wet pillowcases shielded the it from burning sparks and water kept the metal cool. The animal was then cared for by wildlife experts

They found the adult animal distressed and struggling to escape. After determining it could not be freed with soapy water, they returned to the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter to cut it out with a grinder.

The raccoon was safely sedated - and then the hard work began. Wet pillowcases shielded the raccoon from burning sparks and water was used to keep the metal cool.

After being freed from the metal, the raccoon was checked for injuries and given a meal of watermelon, grapes and water once it came out of sedation.

Rebecca Dmytryk, CEO of WES said: 'Other than being quite sore and traumatised by the whole event, the raccoon was in great shape, considering.

The raccoon is treated by vets on the scene for a superficial wound, but otherwise the animal appeared healthy

'The mark on its neck was not deep, so the vet treated it with a topical healing antibiotic spray.'

Rebecca described the moment it was happily freed at nightfall in a blog post: 'I have never seen a raccoon gallop so fast. 

'Slappity-slappity-slappity-slappity, its leather soles of its feet hit the pavement as it shot towards the trees, banking right at the culver and it was gone from sight.'
