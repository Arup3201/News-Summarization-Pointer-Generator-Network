Confusion: Craig Clamp, 27, managed to escape from officers at Aintree Hospital in Liverpool after he was arrested for stealing

A drug addict who was supposed to be under arrest managed to escape from police when officers guarded an elderly patient by mistake.

Serial criminal Craig Clamp was arrested after being accused of stealing from a Morrisons Local supermarket in Formby on Merseyside. 

The 27-year-old started to feel unwell after swallowing a bag of heroin, so was taken to Aintree Hospital for his own safety.

While he was being treated, police officers became confused and ended up watching another patient instead.

Clamp used the opportunity to jump out of a window into the car park below, where he managed to flee.

He was eventually captured five miles away in Bootle after 36 hours on the run, and has now been jailed for 17 weeks following the escape attempt.

Michael Stephenson, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: 'Officers were put on the ward to supervise the prisoner.

'Just before 6am, a time of low attention for most people, two new officers came in to relieve those who had been on night duty.

'They saw their colleagues sitting at a table in the ward facing a man in bed. After discussion with them they took over their duties.

'Half an hour later a nurse asked where Mr Clamp was, had he gone to the toilet? Mr Clamp was not the man in the bed.'

'He had taken advantage of the confusion on the ward and climbed out of the window to escape. CCTV shows him moving at a fairly brisk trot across the car park.

'It’s at odds with the suggestion he woke up in a daze and wandered off.' 

He pleaded guilty to escaping from custody and the court heard he had a lengthy record including 12 previous breaches of bail conditions.

Paul Lewis, defending, said: 'The two police officers who should have been guarding him were guarding the wrong man.

'That calamity allowed him to walk out of the hospital. It resulted in red faces on their behalf rather than any physical harm.

'By his plea he has prevented the officers from having to come here and relive that embarrassment in front of a jury.'

The patient who was mistaken for their prisoner was an elderly man who tried to offer the police guarding him his Werther’s Originals but they told him they could not accept gifts.

Judge Norman Wright jailed Clamp, who was wearing a blue and yellow 'escape suit' for his court appearance, for 17 weeks.

He said: 'It seems there was a change in shift of police officers and there was a misunderstanding as to which patient was the prisoner they were meant to be guarding.

'You seized upon that to effect your escape. You were at liberty for one and a half days.'

The court heard that the original theft allegation Clamp was facing was not proceeded with.
