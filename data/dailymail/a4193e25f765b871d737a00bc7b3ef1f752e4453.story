The calamitous little-known tale of how a Royal Navy submarine sank at its own mooring when blundering crewmen accidentally left its hatches open was today revealed.

HMS Artemis was about to be refuelled at a wet dock in Gosport, Hampshire, in July 1971 when the 280ft vessel began sinking to the horror of her crew.

Hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay and the rear escape hatch was also left open so that power cables could be run through to the control room.

Sinking: HMS Artemis was about to be refuelled in a wet dock in in Gosport, Hampshire, in July 1971 when the 280ft vessel began sinking to the horror of her crew

Rescued from the sinking vessel: Hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay and the rear escape hatch was also left open so that power cables could be run through to the control room

To safety: Duty Petty Officer David Guest is helped ashore from the sunken Artemis. Seawater had gushed through the torpedo bay at the stern and then the open hatch above it

As her fuel tanks were flooded with water in readiness to take on fuel, the vessel sat lower in the water. Seawater began gushing through the torpedo bay at the stern and then an open hatch above.

Within 15 minutes the 1,300-ton submarine, which had served the Navy for 25 years, had sunk to the bottom of the dock. Three crew members trapped inside, although they escaped 12 hours later.

However, the submarine was irreparably damaged. Many of her senior officers, including her  commander, were not aboard at the time - and Artemis was under the control of her third hand.

Following the calamity, a damning report was compiled laying blame firmly on the crew for negligence.

The embarrassing story has come to light after a former crewman took an engine telegraph he salvaged from the wreck along to the BBC programme Antiques Roadshow.

HMS Artemis was an A-class submarine, built by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Greenock on the River Clyde.

It was launched just after the end of the Second World War in August 1946, before taking part in the Fleet Review seven years later for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.

She weighed 1,360 tons and was 280ft long, with a beam of 22ft and a depth of 16ft. It had a diving depth limit of 350ft, a surface speed of 18.5 knots and a crew of 61.

Artemis sank in July 1971 while while moored at the HMS Dolphin shore-establishment at a wet dock Gosport, Hampshire, during refuelling.

She had been there for maintenance, but water began to come in through the open hatchways when she was ballasted down, and she sank.

The submarine was raised five days after sinking before being decommissioned, and sold to be broken up for scrap that December.

A report called 'HMS Artemis - The Lessons Learnt' was produced following the incident - and it is still said to be essential reading for submarine commanders even today. Over its 22 pages, there are 65 errors of judgement.

Peter Taylor, an engine room stoker who was 22 at the time, bought the device upon seeing the wrecked sub about to be dismantled at a scrap yard in Portsmouth in 1993.

The machine, used to send messages from the bridge to the engine room, still has watermarks on it from where it was flooded.

Mr Taylor, 65, from Portsmouth, said: ‘Artemis had just undergone its last ever refit at the dry dock in Gosport, which I had worked on.

‘Following the refit I took leave to my home in Staffordshire and was in the pub when the landlord’s son came over and said my submarine had just sunk.

‘He had just seen it on TV so I got straight onto my motorbike and rode home to see the news.

‘As the sub’s fuel tanks were being flooded with sea water, which is done on subs for ballast purposes, water started coming in through the torpedo bay which had been left open.

‘As the torpedo bay filled up the stern of the sub sank down until water started coming in through the rear escape hatch, which had power cables running through it into the control room.

‘The hatch couldn’t be shut because of 
the cables and within 15 minutes the whole thing was at the bottom of 
the harbour. Basically the crew on the submarine that day were not doing
 their jobs properly.

‘The whole affair was a PR disaster for 
the Navy, especially because it happened at the Submarine Service 
headquarters, and not something they like talking about even to this 
day.

‘It was an embarrassment that should never have happened. In 1993 I noticed Artemis was being cut up and so I went along to see if there was anything left that I could have as a souvenir.

‘The only thing left was the port engine telegraph which I bought for £30.’

The engineering officer, the third hand and the chief stoker were all found at a court martial to have been guilty of making mistakes that caused the submarine to sink.

George Malcolmson, historian at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, said: ‘The sinking of Artemis was not the Submarine Service’s finest hour - it was all very embarrassing.

‘It was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today.

‘The Navy’s first nuclear submarines had 
been introduced to some controversy not long before, and here was a 
group of seamen who couldn’t keep their submarine afloat when docked at 
the service’s HQ.

‘It did not look good at all. Following the sinking the Navy came down hard and a document was produced warning of the danger of complacency.

'It was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today'

George Malcolmson, historian

'It is still used today, and thankfully the incident has never been repeated.’

Paul Atterbury, the Antiques Roadshow specialist, tells Mr Taylor on the show: ‘I think it’s a great story because it’s the sort of story that never gets told because it’s about bungled - you know it’s not the great heroics that we’d all expect. But you’ve got this great treasure and it is a very important piece.’

Mr Taylor’s telegraph machine from HMS Artemis will feature on the Antiques Roadshow on Sunday.
