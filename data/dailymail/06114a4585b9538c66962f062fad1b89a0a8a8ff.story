Body image: Trainor told Billboard that she wrote the song for herself due to her struggles with body image

This top five female domination puts the ladies along side greats like Donna Summer, Anita Ward, and Sister Sledge, who are three of the five that make up Billboard's first-ever all-female top five.

This week is the fourth time in Billboard's 56-year history that females have done this, according to Billboard. 

However, this is the first time an all-female top five has been in place for a consecutive five weeks.

Unlike their predecessors, this group of women isn't topping the charts with mushy romance ballads, theirs is a message of one thing: girl power.

From Trainor telling women not to 'worry about your size' to Swift encouraging females everywhere to forget their critics and 'shake it off,' Billboard boasts that songs like these celebrate a strong self-image.

In July, Trainor told Billboard that she wrote the song for herself due to her struggles with body image.

'If other girls can relate to the song,' Trainor said, 'it makes me feel even better. It's unreal that I'm kind of helping people.'

Though the females have locked guys out of the top five for the fifth consecutive week, Billboard reports that this is only the second week that female artists have knocked boys out of the top six in Billboard history.

The first occurred Feb. 27, 1999 when artists such as Monica, Cher, Houston, Spears, McLachlan and Cox did so.
