When a family decided to sell up and move house, their removals requirement was rather different to most average households.

Because the owners of a four-bedroom home in Wigmore near Gillingham in Kent had to factor-in moving a fighter plane from their garden when they put their home on the market.

This full-size 1940s Vampire jet has been parked in the back garden of the detached house for the last 12 years.

The owners of a four-bedroom home in Wigmore, near Gillingham in Kent, are said to have sold their 1940s Vampire fighter jet since putting their home on the market

The jet fighter plane was dismantled before being lifted into place with the help of a crane. It is now expected to be lifted from the garden of the home in Wigmore, after it was sold privately

But whoever buys the property, which is on the market at £485,000 and described as an 'amazing family home', will not be able to claim ownership of the Cold War fighter plane.

Its owners are selling the aircraft privately, in a separate deal to the home sale.

The current owner, who asked not to be named, had the plane carefully dismantled after it was renovated and then lifted it by crane into place in their garden, where it was painstakingly reassembled.

The aircraft is understood to have been sold already and a crane will be used to gently remove it.

The British-built de Havilland Vampire two-seater jet was originally designed in 1942 but did not come into service with the RAF until after the Second World War in 1945.

It served as a front-line jet fighter until 1953 when the Vampire was deemed obsolete and was later used as a trainer.

The house is on the market for £485,000 and boast four bedrooms as well as the huge garden, which has housed the aircraft for the last 12 years

The de Havilland DH.100 Vampire was a British fighter jet developed during the Second World War.

It was designed to harness the newly developed jet engine and entered service with the RAF in 1945.

It was the first fighter jet to be powered by a single jet engine.

The RAF used the Vampire as a front line fighter until 1953, when it assumed the role of pilot training.

The de Havilland Vampire jet achieved a series of aviation firsts, including being the first British plane to exceed 500mph as well as the first jet fighter to cross the Atlantic

It was retired in 1966 and replaced by the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin.

The model achieved a series of aviation firsts, including being the first British plane to exceed 500mph and being the first jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic.

It took part in several conflicts, including the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Malayan emergency, a guerrilla war fought between Commonwealth forces, the Malayan National Liberation Army and the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party from 1948 to 1960.

Around 3,300 Vampires were manufactured. The Royal Navy's first jet fight was the Sea Vampire, a variant of the plane operated from the Navy's aircraft carriers. As such, the Vampire was the first plane to be landed on a moving aircraft carrier.
