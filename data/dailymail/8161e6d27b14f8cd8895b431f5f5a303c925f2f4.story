A dominatrix woke up to find she had been boarded up inside an alleged massage parlour, it was revealed today.

Firefighters had to be called to remove the two boards from the doorway after the woman, known as Lady Santana, realised she could not get out of the building in Hull, East Yorkshire.

She said she was a dominatrix for 15 years in London and had ‘never had an experience like this’.

Getting out: Firefighters were called when Lady Santana realised she was trapped inside the building in Hull

Thanks: The woman said she was a dominatrix for years in London and had 'never had an experience like this'

Lady Santana added: ‘I feel absolutely
 distraught. No one should be treated like this. I was asleep when they 
came round and boarded it up.

‘I
 don't know how something like this can happen. We need to know who 
exactly is responsible and take it from there. What has happened to me 
is legally and morally wrong.’

The
 alleged massage parlour was being run by a woman calling herself Roxy. 
She claimed a 14-day eviction notice was issued on Thursday and insisted
 the premises should not have been boarded up.

Roxy
 said: ‘The landlord has keys to the property, so why wasn't it checked 
first to make sure no one was in? This put Lady Santana in a very 
dangerous situation.

Response: A Humberside Police spokesman said the force had been made aware of reports about the alleged massage parlour

An investigation has been launched into whether an illegal massage parlour has been operating at the site.

But Roxy said: ‘We have been open for three and a half weeks and have had no complaints.’

A Humberside Police spokesman said the force had been made aware of reports about the alleged massage parlour.
