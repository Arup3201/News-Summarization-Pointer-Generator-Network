President Barack Obama knew his criticism of Christianity at the National Prayer Breakfast would cause a commotion, a former senior adviser to the president, David Axelrod, contends.

'I think he knew what he was saying and he knew it was provocative,' Axelrod told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly during a Monday evening appearance.

Axelrod, who served as the chief strategist on both of Obama's presidential campaigns and served as a top aide to the president at the White House in between, said Obama's 'point is we have a quarter of the world’s population Islamic and the vast majority of them have nothing to do with extremism.'

'And his point is let us not define that entire quarter of the planet by the actions of extremists, let's isolate the extremists,' Axelrod told O'Reilly.

Speaking indirectly about radicalized Islamists,Obama implored his Christian audience at the annual Washington, D.C. gathering last Thursday to get off their 'high horse' and show 'some basic humility.'

Expounding on the importance of reconciling the 'profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, operating alongside those who seek to hijack religious for their own murderous ends,' Obama argued that 'there is a tendency in us ....that can pervert and distort our faith' and it is not 'unique to one group or one religion.' 

'Remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,' Obama said.

Amid a barrage of attacks from the right, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters the next day his interpretation of the comments was 'that over the course of human history there are times where extremists pervert their own religion to justify violence.'

The explanation did little to quell anger, particularly among conservatives. 

'Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he's against the Jews in Israel,' presumed Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Monday on Fox and Friends.

'The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community. It doesn't matter whether it's the radical Muslim community or the more moderate Muslim community,' he charged.

President Barack Obama commended German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday 'speaking out forcefully against xenophobia and prejudice and on behalf of pluralism and diversity.' Obama said, 'she’s made it clear that all religious communities have a place in Germany - just as they do here in the United States'

Despite the blow back, Obama didn't appear chagrined on Monday afternoon during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Instead, he again addressed religious and cultural intolerance, and suggested that it is in effect a recruitment tool for extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.

The best people to prevent young people from falling prey to militant ideology are their 'local communities, families, neighbors, faith leaders,' Obama said. 

'But we can help these communities, starting with the tone and the example that we set in our own countries.'

Commending Chancellor Merkel for 'speaking out forcefully against xenophobia and prejudice and on behalf of pluralism and diversity,' Obama said, 'she’s made it clear that all religious communities have a place in Germany -  just as they do here in the United States.'
