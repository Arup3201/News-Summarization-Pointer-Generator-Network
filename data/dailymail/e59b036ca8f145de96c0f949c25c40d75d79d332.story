Expensive case: Aloke Ray, a lawyer with American firm White and Case, is embroiled in a costly divorce with his estranged wife Charoo Sekhri

A millionaire couple who met via an internet dating agency have risked ‘financial suicide’ fighting over a divorce, a court heard yesterday.

Lawyer Aloke Ray and anaesthetist Charoo Sekhri have spent more than £860,000  on legal fees since separating two years ago.

A High Court judge begged the warring couple to abandon the court battle, which has eroded almost a quarter of their combined wealth.

Mr Ray, 41, who is a partner at the international law firm White & Case, is a specialist in dispute resolution.

He owns property in Hampstead and Colindale in North London.

Dr Sekhri, 39, is a paediatric anaesthetist who had worked at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital and had been living in Ealing, West London.

The court’s family division heard that the ‘highly intelligent, successful’ professionals were married for less than two years, after meeting through an online dating agency in December 2008.

Mr Justice Holman said: ‘They met through an online dating agency when each was in their mid-thirties.

‘They were already mature people. They were – and are – each highly intelligent, successful professional people.

‘They each felt that what they lacked in their lives was a long-term partner or spouse.’

The couple married in December 2009, a year after they met, and had a son another year later.

But within months of the birth they began having violent arguments, and separated soon afterwards.

The judge said: ‘This case  is the story of a tragedy ... under  two years after a marriage with so much promise, divorce became inevitable.’

He said the couple, who are both of Indian origin and currently live in Singapore, have spent a fortune arguing about where their divorce should be heard, even before the proceedings have begun.

Dr Sekhri, who qualified as a doctor in India in 1996 and trained as an anaesthetist in London, issued divorce proceedings in London last April.

The city has been nicknamed the ‘divorce capital of the world’ in legal circles, because its reputation for generous pay-outs for wives mean women are eager to have their divorces heard in Britain.

Concern: A judge at London's High Court said that he begged the couple to resolve their differences or face possible 'financial suicide'

Dr Sekhri has argued that she put her
successful career on hold to have the couple’s son, and should receive 
compensation from her husband as well as maintenance payments while 
their son is dependent on her.

Mr
Ray, who studied at Oxford and Cambridge, opposed the application. The 
court heard that much of the couple’s combined wealth was tied up in 
property he bought before he met Dr Sekhri.

However,
Mr Justice Holman ruled that Dr Sekhri was entitled to pursue 
proceedings in London because both she and her estranged husband had 
been legally ‘domiciled’ in England during their marriage.

Neither Dr Sekhri nor Mr Ray attended the hearing.

The judge told the court: ‘Somewhere the husband will have to make fair provision for the wife.’

He
said he had begged the couple to drop the costly legal fight about 
where their divorce should be  decided during an earlier hearing in May 
this year.

‘Each has spent a staggering sum of about £430,000 on worldwide legal costs, a combined total of over £860,000.

‘I begged these parties to resolve their differences. I referred to financial suicide.

‘The sustained forensic struggle throughout the hearing was painful to observe.’

He
added: ‘These parties are successful and prosperous but they are not 
multi-millionaires. Their total combined wealth is around £4million. 
They have therefore spent just under a quarter of that wealth on 
highly-charged litigation.’

No date has yet been set for the actual divorce proceedings.
