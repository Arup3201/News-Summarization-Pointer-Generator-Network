An 800-year-old recipe for aphrodisiac marmalade is to be turned into a new breakfast spread by the Duchess of Northumberland.

Jane Percy, 54, the chatelaine of Alnwick Castle, is to launch the new lovers' marmalade as part of a new range sold in major supermarkets.

The Duchess, mother of Pippa Middleton's old flame George Percy, discovered the eight-century-old recipe in the dungeons of Alnwick Castle.

Among other recipes, the ancient scroll gave instructions on how to make a special marmalade made from quince.

Due to its pink colour, sweet fragrance and many seeds, quince has for centuries been considered the food of love - and is said to have been given to Queen Mary I to help her conceive.

The Duchess already sells cocktails called Dirty Jane and Desirable Jane and has plans to publish a saucy novel.

Paul Mercer, of Mercer's preserves which will be making the new marmalade, said: 'Marmalade sales have been declining for the last few years as people eat chocolate spread and honey. We are hoping this could bring back a bit of excitement and give marmalade a boost.'

Quince has long been associated with fertility and romance.

The ancient Greeks believed it to be the fruit of Aphrodite, the goddess of love.

Medieval scholars believed quince to have been forbidden apple that lured Even in the Garden of Eden.

Later, 16th-century romantics would wrap quince marmalade in gold foil to boost their libido and fruit is also used in literature to denote love.

The Duchess of Northumberland, whose castle was used as the set for Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films, is famous for her carefully-tended garden, including a poison garden where she researches ancient remedies and potions.

She is planning to publish a book based on the ancient recipes she has discovered.
