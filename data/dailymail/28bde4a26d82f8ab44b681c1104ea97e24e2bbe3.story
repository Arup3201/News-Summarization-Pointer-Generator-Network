Regal: Princess Letizia of Spain at the Children's Literature Awards in Madrid. Her appearance comes just days before a book with details about her alleged secret abortion is published

The author of a book that will damage the Spanish royal family with allegations Princess Letizia had a secret abortion has defended writing it.

David Rocasolano accuses the wife of the heir to the throne of having an abortion and then covering it up in Goodbye, Princess, which is out on Monday.

In an interview with Spanish website Vanitati, Mr Rocasolano says he is just outlining 'the facts I lived' and claims it is not a personal attack on the princess.

He said: 'Perhaps this book will only bring me problems.

'I do not know why I wrote ... Every day I think of a different reason.

'Think what you want. What I think is clear is that Goodbye, Princess is not a book written against a person.

'It is not a book against Letizia nor do I hold any grudge.

'It is a book against an institution, if you want. Or maybe against the institutions of this country.'

The book includes intimate information about Princess Letizia life before she married Crown Prince Felipe in 2004.

It
claims she had an abortion in 2002 - before she 
met the Crown Prince - and that she tried to cover this up before her 
engagement was announced.

Princess
Letizia, a former newsreader and divorcee, allegedly asked for 
paperwork detailing the abortion to be destroyed, according to the book.

Mr
Rocasolano said he was asked by the Princess and Prince Felipe to carry out the task.

The abortion is alleged to have taken place at a time when terminations were still illegal in Spain - unless
there was abnormality or the mother's life or mental well being were significantly threatened.

The book, Goodbye Princess, was written by her cousin, David Rocasolano

He is also candid about his desire to make money from the book. When asked if he wrote it for money, he asked his interviewer: 'Do you love doing this interview for art's sake?'

Despite the book's publication in a few days Spain's Princess Letizia appeared calm and relaxed when she appeared at a literary awards ceremony in Madrid yesterday.

Dressed in a chic black pantsuit and a scoop-neck embellished camisole and heels, the Princess greeted attendees and spoke to the audience at the El Barco de Vapor' Children and Youth Literary Awards in the Spanish capital.

The publication comes at a difficult time for the 
royal family after Princess Cristina - Crown Prince Felipe's sister - 
was implicated in a fraud case.

The Princess's cousin is unrepentant about the book and the allegations it contains

The book is believed to portray the Princess as an 'obsessive' person who is suspicious of her relatives.

It
claims the Princess, 40, thought one of her family had been leaking 
stories about her to the press and that she told some of them she was 
pregnant with a boy in 2005 - when she was actually pregnant with a girl
- to test this out, according to the Telegraph.

Princess Letizia was criticized by some in Spain when she married Crown Prince Felipe as she was a divorcee and a commoner.

Demands have been made for an investigation into the allegations - which could further damage the royal family's public image. A spokesman for the family said it had no comment to make on the book.

The potential embarrassment Princess Cristina, 47 - one of King Juan Carlos's three children - will be called in for questioning later this month, a court in Palma de Mallorca has announced.

She
will be quizzed over claims her husband Inaki Urdangarin, 45, and his 
former business partner Diego Torres, 47, embezzled cash from public 
funds.

Support for having a monarchy in Spain has fallen to a historic low of 54 per cent, according to a poll published in January, the Telegraph reports.
