The police officer parents of a 19-year-old woman are in custody in Oklahoma after she accused them of killing her boyfriend and also attempting to shoot her.

Jeremy Lake was found shot to death on Tuesday night on a street near downtown, Tulsa police department spokeswoman Jillian Roberson said.

Shannon Kepler, 54, has been arrested on a complaint of first-degree murder and Gina Kepler, 48, arrested on a complaint of accessory to murder after the fact.

Daughter Lisa Kepler, 18, sobbed as she told Tulsa World, ‘I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.’

She said she called police and reported the incident. ‘I turned my dad in,’ she said. Both officers were booked on Tuesday night into the Tulsa County jail.

The Keplers are City of Tulsa police officers, have 24 years on the force and were off duty at the time of the shooting, Roberson said.

Lake was walking with Lisa Kepler when her confronted them.

‘I walked away and Jeremy tried to introduce himself, and my dad shot him,’ she told KJRH.

Lisa Kepler started to run, and was shot at, but the bullet missed, Roberson said.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Kepler said that her parents had kicked her out of their home a week ago.

They had dropped her in front of the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, where she had met Lake and they began dating. He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, she said.

‘I don't know what could have led them to do this,’ she said. ‘They didn't even know Jeremy.’

Police Chief Chuck Jordan said in a statement that ‘the circumstances around this incident drives home the fact that domestic violence is a societal problem and transcends all economic groups.’

‘I as well as the whole department am saddened for both families involved in this tragic event,’ Jordan said.

Roberson did not immediately return a message late on Wednesday seeking clarification on what Jordan meant in reference to domestic violence.

The Keplers are being held without bail pending the filing of formal charges and have both been placed on paid administrative leave.
