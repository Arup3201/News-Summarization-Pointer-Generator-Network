Britain is in 'poll position' to be the best performing major economy in the world after securing growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014, new figures showed today.

It is the highest level of annual growth since before the financial crash, which David Cameron said was proof that the government's economic plan is working.

But the data showed the pace of expansion slowed more sharply than expected in the last three months of the year.

The British economy is now 3.4 per cent bigger than the pre-recession peak at the start of 2008, according to the ONS 

The annual figure for the whole of 2014 is the best since 2007, before the recession.

It puts the UK on course to have been the world's fastest growing major economy last year.

But gross domestic product (GDP) rose by just 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, the weakest level in a year, weighed down by a construction sector which shrunk at its worst pace for more than two years.

The growth figure for 2014 was widely expected, though falls short of the 3 per cent forecast last month by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

It beats 2013's figure of 1.7 per cent and matches the 2.6 per cent recorded in 2007.

US growth figures are due to be published on Friday. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates its growth at 2.4 per cent.

The British economy is now 3.4 per cent bigger than the pre-recession peak at the start of 2008, according to the ONS.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said: 'Quarterly growth of 0.5 per cent puts the UK in poll position to be the fastest growing G7 economy in 2014. 

'There is much more to do, but this figure represents solid progress, especially against a backdrop that sees many of our key markets still suffering from economic problems.'

Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Today's figures confirm that the recovery is on track and our plan is protecting Britain from the economic storm, with the fastest growth of any major economy in 2014.

'But the international climate is getting worse, and with 100 days to go until the election now is not the time to abandon that plan and return Britain to economic chaos.'

Speaking before the figures were released, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our economy is growing, we have created 1,000 jobs for every day we have been in office, our growth is one of the strongest in any western economy, and we have made good progress.

'We are working to a long term economic plan that is working.

'But there are flashing lights on the dashboard and one of them is the Eurozone which hasn't been growing and obviously it's a very big market for Britain's exporters and obviously we are not immune from it.' 

Growth of 0.5 per cent in the last three months of 2014 is the lowest since the same period in 2013. Economists had expected it to be at 0.6 per cent.

It makes it more likely that a rise interest rates will be further delayed,amid ultra-low inflation.

Growth was dragged down by construction, which contracted by 1.8 per cent - its worst slowdown since the second quarter of 2012.

Manufacturing grew by just 0.1 per cent, its worst performance since the start of 2013. The wider production sector shrank by 0.1 per cent.

The dominant services sector, which represents more than three quarters of output, grew by 0.8 per cent.

Services are now 7.9 per cent ahead of their pre-downturn level at the start of 2008 but manufacturing remains 5.4 per cent behind while construction is lagging by 7.9 per cent

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'Tory claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow with working people who are still not feeling the recovery. Wages are down by £1600 a year since 2010 and now these figures show a concerning slowdown in economic growth too.

'Construction is down again, business investment under this government is lagging behind our competitors and exports are way off target. And the stagnating wages we have seen over the last five years are the reason why the Chancellor has broken his promise to balance the books.' 

Joe Grice, Chief Economist at the Office for National Statistics said: 'This is the second consecutive quarter in which the growth rate has fallen but it is too early to say if there is a general slowing-down of the economy.

'The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic. '

Samuel Tombs of consultancy Capital Economics said the sharp fall in the oil price, expected to provide a boost in spending, should help the UK 'regain some vigour in early 2015' following the slowdown.

He added that the figures showed 'that the recovery has narrowed to become almost entirely dependent on growth in services sector output' with industrial production and construction down.

'Nonetheless, with the recent halving of oil prices providing a timely boost to households' discretionary spending power, credit still becoming cheaper and pay growth on an improving trend, we think that GDP growth could pick up to 3 per cent this year.

'In short, the best days of the UK's recovery may still lie ahead.'
