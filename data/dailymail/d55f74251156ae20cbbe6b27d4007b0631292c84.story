Their iconic shape has remained largely the same for more than 100 years.

But time is finally catching up with the instantly-recognisable cast iron fire hydrant, seen on so many street corners. Now, the humble hydrant is to get a makeover.

A new tamper-proof and incredibly durable model has been designed that will replace the old ones that apparently continually break down.

It won't break, leak or freeze and, its makers say, will save lives.

Sigelock fire hydrant is designed to be more reliable than its predecessor, which has remained largely the same for 100 years

Not a sprinkler: When it gets hot, residents have been known to open up fire hydrants to relieve themselves from the sweltering heat

The Sigelock Spartan was designed by a former New York firefighter and is intended to work when people need them.

George Sigelakis, founder of a company called Sigelock Systems, told Jessica Hullinger of Fastcoexist.com: 'It would shock you how often fire hydrants don’t work when you need them.

'People live under a false sense of 
security. People don’t realize they need it until they need it, and when
 they need it, it doesn’t work.'

In April, a Channel 2 Action News investigation in Atlanta, Georgia, revealed that many of the city's hydrants are running dry.

It found Georgia does not have a standard dictating how often public fire hydrants should be checked.

Mr Sigelakis, who retired from the NYFD in 2000, spent 20 years researching, developing, and perfecting his prototypes.

The older cast iron fire hydrants tended to rust, cost a lot to maintain and were unreliable

His new model has been thoroughly tested in Long Beach, New York, and met all the requirements for
public safety.

'This will last 200 years maintenance free,' Sigelakis said. 'This is a maintenance-free hydrant.' 

There are currently 150 Sigelock hydrants installed across 11 states. Sigelakis wants to see them in all major cities.
