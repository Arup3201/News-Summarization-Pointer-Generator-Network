The Brazil squad have shown their support for absent team-mates Neymar and Thiago Silva ahead of Tuesday's World Cup semi-final clash with Germany.

Every Selecao player posed in a 'Forza Neymar' cap as a show of unity for their injured talisman who will miss the showdown after injuring his back following a nasty challenge from Juan Zuniga during Brazil's quarter-final victory over Colombia.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was also snapped wearing the hat before the host nation's last-four match.

Show of support: The entire Brazil squad posed in 'Forca Neymar' caps ahead of Tuesday's semi-final

Ready: David Luiz acknowledges the camera whilst wearing his cap as he arrives at the Estadio Mineirao

Backing: Brazil's former Man City and Everton frontman Jo shows his support for his fellow attacker

Together: Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar hold aloft Neymar's shirt during the Brazil national anthem

Meanwhile, a space has been left in the Brazil changing room for absent captain Thiago Silva.

The centre back is suspended for the game against Joachim Low's men but the Brazilians have made sure his presence is felt by leaving his usual spec in the dressing room empty.

As the Brazil team bus arrived at the Stadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte ahead of kick-off, the squad were seen to be singing and banging on the windows.

Without two of their star men, Brazilians will be hoping the rest of the team will rally together and make it to Sunday's final.
