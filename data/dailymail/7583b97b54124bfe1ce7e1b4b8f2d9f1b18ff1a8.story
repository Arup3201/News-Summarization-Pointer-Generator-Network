The school holidays only finished last week, but autumnal colours are already starting to break through in Britain.

These beautiful photographs from County Durham show hedgerows full of hawthorn berries and an apple tree awash with a bounty of fruit.

Two women were also pictured observing the giant leaves of a Virginia creeper which cloak the exterior of the Moritt Arms Hotel in Barnard Castle.

Beautiful tree in County Durham: The school holidays only finished last week, but autumnal colours are already starting to break through across Britain

Hedgerows full of hawthorn berries: The country today enjoyed a largely dry and fine day with sunny periods. These berries were pictured in County Durham

The country today enjoyed a largely 
dry and fine day with sunny periods, especially in the South West, with a
 dry night also forecast.

Similar
 conditions are set to continue tomorrow and Thursday, although it will 
be more cloudy across the East with the odd light shower possible.

High
 temperatures are expected to hover around 20C (68F) this week, with the
 South a few degrees warmer than the North from Thursday to Sunday.

There
 are no Met Office severe weather warnings out for this week, but the 
Environment Agency has 15 flood alerts in place for England and Wales.

Some
 13 are for the South West and North West, but there is also one for the
 Thames from Putney to Teddington, and for the Humber Estuary near Hull.

Meanwhile, scientists warned today 
that Britons should brace themselves for more extreme winters as weather
 conditions become more volatile.

A
 study of seasonal records dating back to 1899 found while most seasons 
have not changed dramatically, winter has become much more 
unpredictable.

The results from a study by East Anglia and Sheffield universities and the Met Office suggest the idea of a typical British winter is becoming a myth.

Wide swings from mild but stormy conditions to extremely cold temperatures and snow in another 
year are becoming more common.

Researchers
found seven out of the ten most extreme winter conditions 
over the last 115 years have occurred in the last decade.
