Thousands of dollars raised for a woman who pretended to have terminal cancer will now be donated to The Children's Hospital at Westmead.

Dozens of compassionate Australians learnt this week that a woman who told her friends and family she had terminal cancer had been running a scam to extort money from donations.

Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, had reported that she was diagnosed with stage six ovarian cancer in April, and had been told she had only three years left to live.

The mother-of-six from Lake Macquarie, NSW, went to great lengths to convince friends, family, and strangers that she had cancer, shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatments

Jessica McKay, the administrator of the 'Help for Elle' Facebook page, announced that the money raised would be donated to children in need of assistance. 

'We hope to help some sick kids in need at Westmead Hospital,' wrote Ms McKay. 

'Hopefully over the next few days everyone will see what an evil person she really is.' 

It's thought nearly $2000 was donated to a bank account set up for Ms Edmunds. 

Police are investigating the matter but are yet to lay charges. 

'What has happend with Elle faking cancer and trying to scam money of people hasn't gone unnoticed and we will be heard. We have people on board,' wrote Ms McKay.

Crowdfunding pages and Facebook charity groups were set up in support for Ms Edmunds, raising significant funds through charity functions and online auctions for her ongoing medical bills. 

Last week it was revealed by an unnamed man who claimed to be Elle's partner that she had never had cancer, and that she had tricked him into believing she did, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Ms McKay wrote a post detailing her fury with Ms Edmunds when she learnt of her deceit.

'With Elle not even having cancer we have had our say and hopefully over the next few days everyone will see what an evil person she really is,' she wrote.

'What has happend with Elle faking cancer and trying to scam money of people hasn't gone unnoticed and we will be heard [sic].'

Ms McKay organised a $150-a-head fundraiser for the Lake Macquarie woman, and was just one of many strangers taken in by Ms Edmunds cancer scam.

The group's page contains several photos of Ms Edmunds with a child, shown in the process of shaving her head and then bald, and detailed efforts to raise money for her, and periodic updates about her health. 

Members of the group who had contributed financially or had been raising awareness for Ms Edmunds labeled her actions 'disgusting', and called for jail time.

One member posted that she hoped Ms Edmunds 'got what she deserved', and labeled her a 'disgrace to humanity, filthy lying cheating human, some will forgive you, many will not, and for someone thats lost loved ones to cancer, I feel no sadness any further for what karma comes your way [sic]'.

'The only truth you have admitted to is being very sick mentally, You are sick mentally, sick, sad and twisted and I feel devastated for your loved ones, let alone mine that were sucked into your evil bull***t.' 

On Sunday Ms Edmunds was asked to explain her behaviour, and claimed that she had 'serious mental health issues'.
