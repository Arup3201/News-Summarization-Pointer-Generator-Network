Payout: Sir Philip Green's Arcadia handed over hundreds of pounds to former interns

Nine leading British companies have been ordered to hand over nearly £200,000 in fines and payouts to interns who had been working for free following a crackdown by Revenue and Customs.

Overall, more than 26,000 workers nationwide denied the minimum wage shared £4million in payments in the last financial year.

Fashion giants Arcadia, run by billionaire Sir Philip Green, paid dozens of former interns hundreds of pounds each in back payments last year after a public outcry.

Under the law, people who are given set hours and defined responsibilities are classed as employees and must receive a wage.

Hundreds of companies regularly
recruit graduate workers without pay and only give them expenses or a 
small allowance for their efforts.

HMRC looked into 40 cases where employers were accused of using interns as full members of staff in 2012-13.

They took action against nine firms 
who were ordered to pay £192,808 in back payments and fines.The maximum fine which can be levied on an individual
company is £5,000.

HMRC have refused to identify any of the nine companies involved.

However, Arcadia confirmed they have 'worked with HMRC' about payments made to interns.

Sir
Philip's Arcadia, owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, run Topshop, 
Miss Selfridge, Burtons, BHS and Dorothy Perkins, and recruited interns 
in their London head office.

Emily Wong, 23, a Royal Holloway University graduate spent a month working at Miss Selfridge in 2011 doing administrative tasks in the PR department.

She was given a London Travelcard and a £2.50-a-day lunch allowance as payment – but later received a cheque for £851.

Sir Philip, who bought the group in 
2002, has not paid himself a dividend since 2005. However, that year it 
emerged the company had paid his Monaco-based wife £1.2billion.

He
faced questions over his company's tax arrangement's last year until he
revealed the company had paid £2.3billion to Revenue and Customs in the
decade after he acquired them.

A spokesman for Arcadia said: 'Arcadia have worked with HMRC on this issue and have no further comment.'

Separately, Harrods paid £1,800 to a 21-year-old graduate intern who worked in their Knightsbridge store for three months unpaid work.

The University of Westminster marketing graduate, from Ealing, west London, received a cheque which equated to 276 hours at the minimum wage.

Overall there are thought to be around 100,000 people a year working as ‘interns’ to gain valuable work experience so they can take the first step on the career ladder.

The minimum wage currently stands at £6.19 per hour, but rises to £6.31 an hour in October.

Gus Baker, co-director of campaigns group Interns Aware, said unpaid internships discriminated against the poorest graduates who lived outside London who are unable to work for nothing to get on the career ladder.

'We have employers who think they can get something for nothing,' he said. 'We have young people who have worked hard at college or university, who play by the rules and often have large debts.

'Then they are told they have to be able to work for free at the end of it.

'It disadvantages people not living within the M25 because they can't get to London to do these internships. If you are hard-working and from Cheshire or Scotland the door is slammed in your face.

'This is bad for employers too because they end up recruiting their workers from a narrower pool.'

Michelle Wyer, assistant director of HMRC’s National Minimum Wage team, said: 'Unpaid interns can provide valuable opportunities. However, we are clear that employing unpaid interns instead of workers in order to avoid the National Minimum Wage is wrong.

'That is why we are cracking down on it. When an intern makes a complaint to the Pay and Work Rights Helpline about their pay conditions that case is prioritised within HMRC to ensure their employer is complying with the law. Where that's not the case, HMRC will not hesitate to take action.

'Paying the national minimum wage is the law not a choice, and the rules apply to all employers equally.'

Overall, last year HMRC investigated 1,693 complaints against employers for breaking minimum wage rules.

This resulted in 708 companies 
receiving automatic penalty charges of up to £5,000 and 26,519 employees
receiving an average of around £150 in back pay, topping up wages that 
had previously been below the legal minimum rate.
