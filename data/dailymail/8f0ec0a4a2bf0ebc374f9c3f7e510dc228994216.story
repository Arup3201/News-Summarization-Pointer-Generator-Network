The greatest World Cups in memory have often been defined by one-man teams, players of such influence and inspiration they have dragged their nation through the tournament.

Diego Maradona and the Argentina of 1986 is, of course, the most celebrated and emphatic of examples.

But there have been countless others; Eusebio firing Portugal to the semi-finals of 1966, Johan Cruyff leading the Dutch to the final eight years later, Roberto Baggio doing likewise with Italy in 1994 and Zinedine Zidane twice the star of France’s passage to the final in 1998 – when they won on home soil – and in 2006 when they were beaten by Italy, the latter perhaps more impressive.

Maradona, though, remains the most iconic player in World Cup history, the spellbinding nature of his one-man show ensuring such. In Brazil, however, there are a pair of contenders for his crown.

For, like Maradona, compatriot Lionel Messi and host nation golden boy Neymar are shouldering the hopes of an entire population. And it appears they are more than capable of carrying such weighty expectation.

It is shaping up to be the ultimate head-to-head.

Already the Barcelona comrades reside at the summit of the scoring chart with four goals apiece; by this juncture in Mexico 28 years ago Maradona had just one. Their latest helpings were a pair of doubles; Messi's in the 3-2 win over Nigeria, Neymar in the 4-1 destruction of Cameroon.

To illustrate their influence, minus Messi’s goals Argentina would be back in Buenos Aries today having exited with just two points, while Brazil – without the contribution of Neymar – would have only just scraped through to the latter stages in second place.

As it is, though, they both advance as group winners and so protect the possibility of a meeting in the Maracana on July 13.

It – Brazil versus Argentina, Neymar versus Messi – is the final with which this most mesmerising of tournaments deserves to climax.

We have all enjoyed the team ethic of the Chileans, the organisation and killer instinct of the Dutch, the flair of the French and the devastating dynamism of the Colombians.

But there is something even more magical about one man overcoming the flaws and frailties of his team-mates to determine destiny. Such impact gives birth to legend. Such impact at a World Cup cements it for eternity.

And, like Diego, their genius is effortless, aesthetically at least. For if the likes of Luiz Gustavo and Javier Mascherano are the water-carriers, then Messi and Neymar turn it to wine.

Both players have laid quite fabulous foundations from which to build as we enter the knockout rounds, the environment in which tournaments and players are, ultimately, defined.

Failure to negotiate the next hurdle – Switzerland for Argentina and Chile for Brazil – would render their early impact sadly academic, for no-one remembers a group-stage hero; Gabriel Batistuta scored four times for Argentina in the first round of France 98 but did not even make FIFA’s all-star squad.

The stage, then, is set.

Can either of the talismanic No.10s prove they are No.1? Maradona-like legend awaits if so.
