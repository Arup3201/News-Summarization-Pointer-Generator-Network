A father, who saved his five-year-old daughter after their kayak capsized on a  dam, has been described as 'selfless' by his church family. 

Ben Urquhart was a lifelong member of the The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in Bathurst, NSW and news of his tragic death has shocked the congregation. 

In a statement the church said the 36-year-old had a 'selfless tendancy to help others in need - a quality he employed even in the final heroic moments of his life'. 

Emergency services responded to reports of two people in trouble at Chifley Dam near Bathurst in the NSW Central Tablelands at about 7.30pm on Saturday.

Police were told the kayak had flipped, putting the 36-year-old man and his little girl into the water who were not wearing life jackets at the time. 

A father drowned after saving his five-year-old daughter when their kayak capsized on Chifley Dam near Bathurst in the NSW Central Tablelands at about 7.30pm on Saturday

A spokesman for the church said the married father-of-three was remembered for his work with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. 

They added: 'Mr Urquhart was a member of the rapid relief team, a group that offers charity, including in natural disasters.

'The team provided catering and refreshments to Rural Fire Service (RFS) teams during last year's bushfires.

'More recently the Bathurst-based team cooked for rescue teams looking for missing bushwalker Sevak Simonian in the Blue Mountains.'  

Bathurst Inspector Andrew Spliet told Daily Mail Australia that witnesses helped get the little girl onto their kayak, but her father then disappeared under the water.

'A number of people entered the water and tried to locate the man but it all happened very quickly,' he said. 

He said there were about 30 - 40 people at the dam at the time as it was a popular spot for water sports, fishing and power boats 

Just before 9pm, police rescue officers recovered the man's body a short distance from where the kayak had capsized. 

Inspector Spliet said it was still unknown how the man drowned but it may have been due to exhaustion after saving his daughter in the water that was anywhere from 3.5 - 5m deep. 

He urged people to always wear life jackets when heading out onto the water.

'It's confident to say that the man would not be deceased if they were wearing life jackets,' he said. 

'Also if you are going to enter waterways ensure you are a competent swimmer who is confident in deep water.' 

Police will prepare a report for the coroner and are still investigating how Mr Urquhart drowned but don't believe dam conditions were rough or there were strong currents.
