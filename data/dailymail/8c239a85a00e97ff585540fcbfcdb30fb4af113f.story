Dylan Hartley returns from suspension against the Ospreys in the European Cup on Sunday after spending three weeks painting Northampton’s changing rooms.

The hooker’s latest ban, his fifth, was imposed for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith and he kept busy during his lay-off by painting Saints’ changing room in club colours.

‘Maybe he thought he could add something to the psychological value of the room,’ said team-mate Phil Dowson. ‘But it was awful and it’s been re-done.’

Hartley, 28, now hopes to show he has learned his lesson and put in a couple of solid performances before England’s Six Nations opener against Wales on February 6.

Dowson added: 'Dylan understands he has made a mistake and he wants to get back on the horse.

'It is a great opportunity for him to show his maturity and his experience. There have been occasions when he has been under pressure and reacted badly and there have been others when he has reacted really strongly.'
