A campaign aimed at preventing bullying in schools across the U.S. is being boycotted by a conservative Christian group that claims it promotes homosexuality among students.

Mix It Up At Lunch Day, which sees schoolchildren encouraged to sit with fellow pupils they wouldn't normally spend time with, is designed to break up social cliques and stop students feeling isolated, organisers say.

But the American Family Association, a conservative evangelical group, has branded the project a 'nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools'.

Mix It Up: Organisers of the event say it is designed to help break down social barriers and curb bullying in schools

Around 200 schools have cancelled plans to hold Mix It Up At Lunch Day on October 30 after the association e-mailed parents urging them to keep their children at home on the day of the event.

Maureen Costello, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which launched the programme 11 years ago, said the Christian group had lied to parents about the aims of the event and reverted to a 'cynical, fear-mongering tactic'.

The Southern Poverty Law Center recently added the American Family Association - which describes itself as acting to 'restrain evil by exposing the works of darkness' - to its national list of active hate groups, which also includes neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers.

But Bryan Fischer, director of issue analysis for the association, said it was not a hate group but rather 'a truth group'.

He said that, while Mix It Up Day does not specifically address homosexual students, the Law Center promotes equal treatment for gay and lesbian pupils and that philosophy informs the event.

'It's just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual agenda,' Mr Fischer told the New York Times.

'No one is in favour of anyone getting bullied for any reason, but these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing Christian students who believe that homosexual behaviour is not something that should be normalised.'

Ms Costello, director of the Law Center's Teaching Tolerance project, told the newspaper Mix It Up Day was not about sexual orientation but rather about breaking up fixed social cliques, which can be especially evident in school cafeterias.

She said pupils who are gay or perceived to be gay can often be on the receiving end of bullying at school, but insisted any suggestion the programme was intended as a means of homosexual indoctrination was totally wrong.

'Weâ€™ve become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks but this one was complete misrepresentation,' she said.

Only one of around 200 schools that have cancelled planned Mix It Up Days agreed to comment.

The Chattahoochee County Education Center in Cusseta, Georgia, said it decided to cancel because teachers were too busy trying to meet state teaching requirements, and not because it wanted to take a position on gay rights.

The Avon Grove Charter School in rural Pennsylvania is still planning to hold Mix it Up At Lunch Day for its 1,600 students, despite complaints from parents.

Headteacher Kevin Brady said the e-mail from the American Family Association described an event that bore 'absolutely no resemblance to what we do'.

He said that once parents understood how the programme actually worked, they saw no reason not to allow their children to attend school.

On Mix It Up At Lunch Day students are each assigned a number and then paired up by school officials to sit together at lunch time.
