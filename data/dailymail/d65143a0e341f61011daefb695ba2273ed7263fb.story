Tests on Melbourne sewage show high enough levels of ice for the drug to have been used by one in every 20 Victorians.

The highest ice usage occurred in the CBD, a study by the Penington Institute and the University of South Australia has found.

The study took sewage treatment system samples twice in a week from plants around Victoria, which enabled comparison of weekend versus mid-week drug consumption.

Melbourne Water's western treatment plant, covering a population of 1.6 million people, had the highest levels with 51.4 doses of methamphetamine per 1000 people on a Sunday

Warracknabeal (population 2355)5.47 doses per 1000 people (Sunday) 6.05 per 1000 (Wednesday)

West Wodonga (population 35,200)18.2 per 1000 (Sunday)12.5 per 1000 (Wednesday)

Black Rock (population 236,000)17.6 per 1000 (Sunday)14.7 per 1000 (Wednesday)

Melbourne Eastern Treatment (population 1.5 million)25.1 per 1000 (Sunday)22.4 per 1000 (Wednesday)

Melbourne Western Treatment (population 1.6 million)51.4 per 1000 (Sunday)38.8 per 1000 (Wednesday)

The report compared methamphetamine levels between Melbourne, Geelong, Wodonga on the Murray River and the small Wimmera town of Warracknabeal.

Waste water from Melbourne Water's western treatment plant, covering a population of 1.6 million people, had the highest levels with 51.4 doses of methamphetamine per 1000 people on a Sunday, and 38.8 doses per 1000 on a Wednesday.

Melbourne's eastern treatment plant showed 25.1 doses per 1000 people on a Sunday, and 22.4 doses per 1000 on a Wednesday.

Black Rock, which covers much of Geelong, showed 17.6 doses per 1000 people on a Sunday, and 14.7 doses per 1000 on a Wednesday.

Penington Institute acting CEO Wendy Dodd says the tests showed there was an issue in relation to methamphetamines.

'From the data, it has demonstrated that it's higher on weekends and it's supporting the view that there is a high proportion of occasional, recreational users,' she told Fairfax Radio.

The report also found that there had been more than a 250 per cent increase in the number of fatal overdoses involving methamphetamine since 2010.

It also found that methamphetamine purity has risen in Victoria, from an approximately 20 per cent in 2010-2011 to more than 75 per cent in 2012-2013.

A state parliamentary inquiry will release its findings into the supply and use of the drug on Wednesday, while the Victorian government has announced 11 police drug dogs will be sent across the state, including eight in major regional centres.
