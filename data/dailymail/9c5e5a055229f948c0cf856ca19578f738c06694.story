With Diego Costa banned for Chelsea's crucial Premier League clash against Manchester City on Saturday, club legend Didier Drogba will lead the line for Jose Mourinho's side.

Unfortunately for the Stamford Bridge club, Drogba's goal scoring record against City isn't quite up to the striker's own high standards.

Since his first game against City in 2005, the Ivorian striker has managed to score just five times in 14 games and is without a goal in his last nine appearances against the current Premier League champions.

Drogba's last goal against City came during a brilliant 6-0 home win for Chelsea in October, 2007 when he bagged a brace against a defence which consisted of Micah Richards, Richard Dunne, Javier Garrido and Vedran Corluka.

Michael Essien, Joe Cole and Andriy Shevchenko were the other names on the scoresheet as a powerful Chelsea side looked to deal with Mourinho's 2007 departure from the club with a third successive league victory under Avram Grant.

Frank Lampard, who will be lining up against his old club on Saturday, was at his very best for Chelsea on the day, laying on two goals and providing a memorable assist for Drogba with the outside of his right boot.

Upon Drogba's return to west London last summer, many believed a second spell at Chelsea would see the striker struggle to make an impact.

In fact, the 36-year-old has managed to prove his worth, scoring six goals so far this season and providing valuable experience in the dressing room.

Speaking of Drogba's impact on the first team, Mourinho said in December: 'You know ... first of all he’s a team player. After that, he’s one of these 'old-days mentality’: not selfish, not vain, a humble guy who plays and fights for the team.

'Fantastic. When he is on the bench and comes on for the last few minutes because the team needs someone to hold the ball or defend set pieces, he does that with the same enthusiasm and spirit as he does when he starts a game.'
