An ‘army of legal superstars’ persuaded prosecutors to sign a controversial agreement which may have given Prince Andrew protection from prosecution, it is claimed.

Highly-paid lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein – some of whom had links to the White House – secured an extraordinary deal which guaranteed ‘potential co-conspirators’ would not face criminal charges relating to his activities.

They had spent months delving into the private lives of state prosecutors to establish if they had any ‘personal peccadilloes’, in a desperate bid to defend Epstein against claims of abusing scores of under-age girls at his Florida mansion.

Claims: The Duke of York, left, with Jeffrey Epstein in 2011. The billionaire's lawyers persuaded prosecutors to sign a agreement which may have given Prince Andrew protection from prosecution, it is claimed

The aggressive tactics culminated in an extraordinary ‘non-prosecution agreement’ being struck between Epstein and prosecutors in September 2007. This halted any prospect of Andrew being asked to answer questions on oath about his paedophile friend’s antics. The agreement states: ‘The United States agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff or Nadia Marcinkova.’

Many serious charges against Epstein and any ‘co-conspirators’ were wiped out, in return for the billionaire pleading guilty to the relatively minor charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution. After the accord had been signed, his lawyers fought to ensure it remained secret.

They bombarded the US Attorney’s office in Florida with hundreds of pages of legal argument intended to prove that Epstein’s victims did not have any legal right to know a plea agreement had been struck.

According to official documents, Epstein’s attorney Jay Lefkowitz – a former deputy director of domestic policy at the White House under George W Bush – sent a one-line email to the US Attorney’s Office on September 24, 2007: ‘Please do whatever you can to keep this from becoming public’.

On November 29, 2007, Lefkowitz called for more secrecy in a letter to the Florida state attorney: ‘We don’t understand the basis for your Office’s belief that it is appropriate for any letter to be sent to these individuals at this stage – before Mr Epstein has either entered a plea or been sentenced.’

Lefkowitz disputed the suggestion that the victims had the right to be heard at any plea or sentencing, adding: ‘Encouraging these individuals to participate in the state sentencing will have the effect of creating a media frenzy that will surely impact the sentence Mr Epstein received – precisely what your Office promised to avoid.’

Andrew may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy.

Diplomatic immunity provides foreign diplomats protection from legal action in the country where they work. It is granted depending on an individual’s rank and the level of immunity they need to carry out their duties.

But diplomats are still expected to follow the laws of their host countries. In the US, several levels of immunity protecting foreign diplomats from legal action are granted. Extradition lawyer Karen Todner, who represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon, said the prince could simply ignore any request to give evidence.

‘If proceedings are civil, extradition [law] does not apply, so he can just refuse to go,’ she said.

He could be compelled to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’, she added. If he refused to co-operate, however, the prince could be banned from entering the US.

It is not known whether Andrew might be covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law.

Critics claim the deal was a scandalous cover-up – supported by the political establishment – to protect Epstein and his influential circle of friends. R Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney for Southern Florida, who signed off on the non-prosecution agreement, has told of the aggressive tactics employed.

In an open letter on the case four years ago, Mr Acosta said Epstein had ‘hired an army legal superstars’, citing Lefkowitz and Kenneth Starr – lead prosecutor against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He added: ‘The defence strategy was not limited to legal issues. Defence counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that might provide a basis for disqualification. Defence counsel tried to disqualify at least two prosecutors.’

Mr Acosta said that ‘some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher, adding: ‘Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken out, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had these additional statements and evidence been known, the outcome may have been different.’

Epstein’s treatment during his year in prison, where he is reported to have had an easy ride, ‘undermined the purpose of a jail sentence’ and may ‘encourage the view’ that prosecutors should have been ‘tougher’ with him, Mr Acosta said.

Despite these comments, questions remain over why he and fellow US prosecutors agreed to provide a blanket immunity to men and women who had allegedly been involved in Epstein’s crimes. The disgraced financier has spent huge amounts of time, effort and money making sure there is no evidence to implicate third parties.

The potential co-conspirators who have been named publicly have all kept quiet. Former model Adriana Ross, who is referred to in the non-prosecution agreement, refused to answer any questions, including some about Prince Andrew, when deposed by lawyers representing Epstein’s victims.

Other key friends in his circle were equally reticent when asked on oath about his activities. If the allegations against any famous public figures are true, the agreement means the US government has provided them with an extraordinary get-out-of-jail free card.

Experts in criminal law in America still question how Epstein’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years. Possibly the most critical question is whether the FBI was aware of any allegations involving Prince Andrew when the non-prosecution agreement was signed.

Buckingham Palace refuses to comment on whether the prince has ever been interviewed by the FBI – even as a witness – over Epstein’s liaisons with young girls.

Epstein was released in July 2009. In recent days, there have been claims that the prince lobbied on behalf of his disgraced friend for a reduced jail term.

This has been denied by Buckingham Palace. A royal official said: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case.’

But more than a year after his release from jail, Epstein was pictured walking in New York’s Central Park with Andrew – a show of loyalty from the prince which has repercussions to this day.

Envoy and minister left facing questions 

By Sam Marsden for the Daily Mail 

Former UK ambassador to Washington Sir David Manning, pictured, faced questions tonight

A former British ambassador and an ex-Foreign Office minister faced questions last night about what they discussed with Prince Andrew while Jeffrey Epstein was under police investigation.

The Duke of York met then-UK ambassador to Washington Sir David Manning in September 2006, one month after the billionaire pleaded not guilty to soliciting prostitution.

Official records show that he also had a meeting with then-Foreign Office minister Kim Howells in July 2005, four months after American detectives launched their inquiry into Epstein.

Both Sir David and Dr Howells were in their roles at a time when Epstein was enjoying a decadent life among global high society. Royal sources insisted the prince did not interfere in the active legal case against the wealthy US paedophile.

But he may have been concerned that he would himself face questioning about what – if anything – he knew of Epstein’s activities.

Epstein had previously attended a weekend party at the Queen’s Sandringham estate in 2000, and was a guest at the Queen’s birthday party in Windsor that same year.

The prince also holidayed in Thailand with the financier in 2001.

As the UK’s special trade envoy until 2011, Prince Andrew travelled widely around the world at this time promoting British businesses overseas – including in America. But the topics of his conversations with British and US officials are unknown.

He made three official trips to America while Epstein was under investigation, including two in September 2006. One was to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York, while the other was to Washington.

The prince visited again in February 2008, five months after US federal prosecutors concluded a secret plea bargain with the financier that guaranteed he and any ‘potential co-conspirators’ would not face criminal charges.

He started this third trip in Florida, the location of Epstein’s home where much of the alleged sexual abuse took place. There is nothing to suggest that the prince visited his friend or intervened on his behalf at this time.

A royal official said: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case, and did not do so in this case.’

Speaking from his home in South Wales yesterday, Dr Howells insisted he had not been at any meeting with the duke in July 2005 but could offer no explanation as to why the official records might be incorrect. He said he knew nothing about Epstein’s case, adding: ‘I do remember meeting Prince Andrew once in Qatar, but all he talked about was himself and what a good ambassador he was.’

Sir David, who is now an aide to Prince William, could not be reached for comment last night.
