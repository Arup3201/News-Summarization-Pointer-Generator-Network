Mark Palios and his wife Nicola have become the new owners of League Two's Tranmere Rovers.

The takeover - as reported by Sportsmail's Charles Sale earlier this month - sees Mark, a former FA chief executive and midfielder who made 249 league appearances for Rovers, replace Peter Johnson after the pair reached an agreement.

The shift means Mark will act as executive chairman and Nicola as vice-chairman, while Johnson will remain a shareholder, director and an honorary president.

New owners: Mark and Nicola are 'the safe pair of hands to ensure the club's future' on Merseyside

The former Football Association chief executive resigned from his post in early August 2004 following media revelations about his relationship with FA secretary, Faria Alam - the same secretary that went on to have an affair with England manager Sven Goran Eriksson.

At the time, Palios said: ‘I am very sad that I feel this is necessary. It has been a privilege to be chief executive of the Football Association but with privilege comes the burden of responsibility.’

He added: ‘Personally, I do not accept that I have been guilty of any wrongdoing.’ 

'I have been looking for a safe pair of hands to ensure the club's future,' Johnson, who took control of the club in 1987, told Tranmere's official website.

'In Mark and Nicola I have found that. As a local lad who played for the club, and a former chief executive of the FA with a successful commercial track record, Mark is uniquely placed to help lead Tranmere to a bright future.

'Nicola is an accomplished lawyer and businesswoman.

'Between them, they have the passion and the experience to take the club forward and I am looking forward to working on the board with them.

'Finding this mix of football and business skills is highly unusual.' 

Tranmere drew their first game of the season 1-1 against York City, after the Birkenhead outfit suffered relegation last year.

Mark added: 'There is a big job to be done to get the club back in the higher divisions and get the facilities back up to scratch.

'In the coming weeks and months we will share with you our plans on how we intend to make it happen.'
