More than 674 people have complained to the BBC after presenter John Inverdale suggested Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker'

The BBC presenter who made disparaging comments about Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli has been labelled a ‘sexist moron’ by viewers.

The corporation has received 674 complaints and was forced to issue a grovelling apology after John Inverdale said the French star was ‘never going to be a looker’.

He tried to draw a line under the matter the following day by explaining his comments on air and sending an apologetic letter to Bartoli.

But even though the player said the incident ‘doesn’t matter’, Inverdale has been hit by a furious backlash from listeners, who said his apology was ‘inadequate’.

Many took to social networking site Twitter to express their disgust, with some demanding that he resign.

Inverdale, 55, who anchored the BBC’s TV coverage of the Wimbledon championships, made his comments during an interview with Radio 5 Live ahead of Saturday’s women’s final.

He said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, “listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker.

“You are never going to be somebody like a (Maria) Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5ft 11in, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that.’

Inverdale attended the champions’ dinner at London’s Park Lane Hotel on Sunday night.

He greeted Andy Murray’s mother, Judy, with a hug and a kiss. French champion Miss Bartoli, 28, disproved the presenter’s theory when she arrived at the event looking glamorous in a figure-hugging black dress and heels.

She brushed off his remarks, saying: ‘It doesn’t matter, honestly.’

But many listeners were not so happy to let the matter drop.

Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘Inver-dale’s sexist remarks makes me sick in the stomach BBC.’ Another added, ‘John Inverdale is such a chauvinist’; while others said, ‘This isn’t a “gaffe” – the commenter is a sexist moron’, and ‘You should be ashamed. Resign.’

On Sunday, Inverdale apologised for his ‘clumsy’ comments. A BBC spokesman added: ‘We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.’

Colin Murray is quitting Radio 5 Live for talkSPORT a month after BBC bosses had to apologise when his weekly Fighting Talk show included a section on how openly gay presenter Clare Balding could be 'turned around'.

The Northern Irishman, who started his BBC career at Radio 1, will join the station next month to present a weekday sports show.

A BBC spokesman said the show will continue with a new presenter.

Radio 5 Live controller Jonathan Wall said: 'Colin leaves with our very best wishes having done such a good job on Fighting Talk over the last seven years, and on 5 Live Sport over the last four years, especially during the Olympics.' 

The BBC apologised last month when a live version of Fighting Talk included a satirical section called Defend the Indefensible in which comic Bob Mills was asked to justify the argument : 'Give me 20 minutes with her and I'm pretty sure I could turn around Clare Balding.'

The section, in which Mills described Balding as a "horse woman" who "appreciates power between her thighs", was cut from the iPlayer version of the show and a BBC spokeswoman admitted they had 'got it wrong' and it was 'inappropriate'. 

A BBC spokesman said the show will continue with a new presenter.

Murray was dropped as host of Match Of The Day Two at the end of last season and will be replaced by Mark Chapman later this year.
