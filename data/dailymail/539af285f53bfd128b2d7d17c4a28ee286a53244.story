Maria Sharapova put in a business-like performance to cast aside qualifier Timea Bacsinszky 6-2 6-1 in only an hour on her way to the third round at Wimbledon.

The fifth seed showed the sort of ruthless precision that won her the French Open title this month. She broke Bacsinszky's serve five times on Thursday, forcing her Swiss opponent to scramble left and right to retrieve powerful groundstrokes.
