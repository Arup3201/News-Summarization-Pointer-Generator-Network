Liam Stewart, the ice hockey playing son of rock star Rod Stewart and former model Rachel Hunter, has seen his hopes of making his senior Great Britain debut ended by injury.

The 20-year-old forward, born in London, had been included in new head coach Pete Russell's 23-man party for the World Championship in Holland next week.

But Stewart sustained a shoulder injury during Spokane Chiefs' Western Hockey League play-off series against Everett and is replaced in the squad by Craig Peacock of Belfast Giants.

Russell said: 'Liam is so disappointed not to be coming but he has picked up a shoulder injury. He has just had a really intense play-off series and his injury means he will not be able to travel.

'It is a shame for the lad but I am sure his time will come again in the future. It means a place now for Craig Peacock, who was unlucky to be left out of the original 23-man squad.

'Craig is a highly-talented player and it was a hard decision for me to leave him out in the first place. I am sure Craig will prove me wrong that I should not have left him out.'
