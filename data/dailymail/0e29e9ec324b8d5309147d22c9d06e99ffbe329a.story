College football star quarterback AJ McCarron took personal responsibility for his team's shock Sugar Bowl defeat on Thursday, and the horrified expression of his supermodel girlfriend said it all.

Katherine Webb covered her face in disbelief as McCarron fumbled the final move of his amazing college career at Alabama Crimson Tide, allowing Oklahoma a touchdown which sealed a 45-31 win.

'Put it all on me. I had two turnovers, (Oklahoma) ended up scoring 14 points, and we lost by 14,' said McCarron, who won 36 of his first 38 games before losing his last two.Â

'I wish it wouldn't have happened, but
 I'll definitely take the loss and definitely take the blame, because a 
lot of it is probably my fault,' the quarterback said in his last game before moving to NFL.

While McCarron passed for 387 yards - the most of his impressive career so far - and two touchdowns, his two interceptions set up Oklahoma TDs.

He was also sacked 
seven times, fumbling on the last one, and Alabama's Geneo Grissom returned his 
second recovery of the game eight yards for a score.

Watching in the stands at the New Orleans Superdome, McCarron's girlfriend Webb, who was Miss Alabama 2012, looked stunning in an understated black top.

Heartbreak: While McCarron passed for 387 yards - the most of his impressive career so far - and two touchdowns, his two interceptions set up Oklahoma TDs. And it was hard for his mom and girlfriend to take

Webb was supporting the Crimson Tide with McCarron's mother, father and grandmother, but her face was the most and unimpressed when her boyfriend's college career came to a bitter conclusion.

In the final year of the BCS, Oklahoma Sooners coach Bob Stoops won the one major bowl that had eluded him, and proved a point about parity in the process.

After taking the past month to cultivate a young quarterback who was still coming into his own, Stoops brought a confident and motivated Sooners squad to the Sugar Bowl.

Freshman Trevor Knight completed a Sugar Bowl-record 32 passes for 348 yards and four touchdowns for 11th-ranked Oklahoma, outshining Heisman Trophy runner-up McCarron.

The convincing victory also gave Stoops an I-told-you-so moment, backing up his comment last offseason that the gap between the Southeastern Conference and other top leagues like the Big 12 is not as great as some 'propaganda' makes it out to be.

'I have the utmost respect for Alabama, and I think this shows that obviously we can play with anybody,' Stoops said.

'So, enough of that. And I just watched them go through their entire conference and play pretty well. I'm not pointing any fingers. But I think sometimes the comparisons aren't necessarily very true.'

Stoops became the first coach to win all four BCS bowl games, having already won the Orange, Rose and Fiesta bowls.

'It's huge for our program, to get a win like this after no one gave us a chance all year,' Knight said. 'We've got to ride this into next year. We can't settle with this. ... We want the big one.'

Oklahoma (11-2) needed him to play that well in the 80th Sugar Bowl, the first in which quarterbacks for both teams threw for more than 300 yards.

Model attitude: Webb posted this snap on Instagram

His Big 12 team vanquished an Alabama
 (11-2) squad that had been ranked No. 1 much of the past three seasons,
 winning the previous two national titles before its shot at a third 
straight was derailed by Auburn on the last play of the Iron Bowl in 
late November.

Coach
 Nick Saban didn't find his team, favored by 16 points, was too deflated
 from its loss to Auburn to play up to its standard.

'I actually thought that the players responded in practice pretty well for this game,' Saban said. 'We put over 500 yards of offense up.

'Somebody had to do something right. I don't think that we played as well on defense as we're capable of or should have.'
