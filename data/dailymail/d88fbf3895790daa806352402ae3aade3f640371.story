Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the company’s disastrous IPO damaged the company’s image during his first interview since the company went public in May.

‘The performance of the stock has obviously been disappointing,’ the Facebook founder, chairman and CEO said while being questioned at a technology conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.

While talking about his personal coding skills, Zuckerberg tellingly said to applause: ‘Everything I do breaks, but we fix it quickly’.

His interview comes amid massive turmoil within the company, as four senior executives have left in recent months and the company's morale is predictably low after their share price dropped to nearly half of what it was when they launched.

Under fire: Mark Zuckerberg had his first interview since his company went public in May

Zuckerberg broke his silence at Tech Crunch Disrupt, answering questions posed by the conference’s founder Michael Arrington who has been critical of the social networking company in the past.

Mr Arrington asked about how the 
dramatic decrease in stock worth has affected the company’s morale and 
Zuckerberg was blunt in responding: ‘Well it doesn’t help.’

The
hardest-hit by the dropping share price -which 
initially launched at $38-per-share in May and now stands at a paltry 
$19.48 - are employees who are 
paid partially in stock, but the 28-year-old multi-billionaire said that
the company takes the lackluster stock price into consideration when 
doling it out for salary.

‘We haven’t really done anything on equity to incentivise people,’ he said.

‘The
way that we do compensation is we translate the amount of cash we give 
you into shares so if the shares are undervalued’ they give employees 
more stock to equate to the amount they feel is fair.

‘We're going to do the things we think will build value over the long run,’ Zuckerberg explained while justifying the decision to go public.

‘We are a mission-driven company’ which he said tends to look to their larger goal of making the world more open and transparent, but like any business, ‘you can’t just focus on that.’

The sit down: Tech Crunch founder Michael Arrington, who has been critical of Facebook in the past, interviewed Zuckerberg for about 30 minutes on Tuesday afternoon

‘The best people want to work on a mission they believe in but they also want to make a lot of money.

‘In order to do that we need to have a business model that makes a lot of money.’

‘Building a mission and building a business goes hand in hand… the primary thing that makes me excited is about the mission.’

The decision to appear for the interview
was a clear effort by Zuckerberg to open up and re-energize the company
in hopes of stemming the exodus of key employees.

Over the course of the summer, five 
department heads all left the company, but today Zuckerberg said that he
feels now is the time to 'double down'.

Focus on phones: While he said that he 'does everything' on his phone, he repeated past denials that the company is developing a phone of their own

'I actually think that its a great time for people to stay,' he said, which was met with moderate applause.

The appearance may have worked as well, with some analysts predicting that the talk helped increase Facebook's market capital by $1.7billion during the half-hour talk.

The Facebook stock went up two per cent during after-hours trading, showing a positive response from the business world about the CEO's talk.

Zuckerberg explained that he takes a inherently cautious approach when it comes to his evaluation of the company's public image.

'When people are writing nice stuff about us, it's important to get in front of the company and say, "Don't believe all this." When they write negative stuff, it's important to get in front of the company and say, "Don't believe all this."

'We are very self-critical too.'

One of the mistakes that Zuckerberg pointed out was that they spent too long focusing on their HTML platform for the web as opposed to adapting and improving the product for mobile devices which he now firmly believes is the future of the network. He said that they underestimated 'how fundamentally good mobile is' for their growth.

From a numbers perspective, he said a focus on mobile phones makes sense simply because they will have so many more prospective users as more people have phones than computers. That shift also makes financial sense for advertisers as engagement levels are higher on phones as well.

'I basically live on my mobile device,' Zuckerberg said. 'You know the founders letter in the S-1? I wrote that on my phone. I do everything on my phone.'

Having fun: Zuckerberg admitted that his job is now more about achieving the mission of creating a more open web and while he did say he still had fun, his focus is more on building 'good stuff'

Mr Arrington admitted that he has floated the theory that Facebook is developing their own physical phone for years- imagining a world where a group of engineers have been hidden away to create the new device- but Zuckerberg echoed his past denials repeatedly during the talk.

He explained that it is better for Facebook to be available on all different mobile networks so that they can reach the most users no matter what type of phone they have, rather than spending time, money and energy developing their own product that would only get '10 million, 20 million people to use it. That doesn't move the needle for us!'

'Do you believe me yet? It's always been such a juicy story, but it's so clearly the wrong strategy for us,' he affirmed.

In that same vein, Zuckerberg said that the company is actively developing their new Facebook app for Android but was non-committal when discussing a launch date, saying only that 'it will be ready when it's ready'.

Another area that he confirmed is under improvement is the network's search function because he feels there is a depth of untapped potential for the tool since it typically just used to find people.

'We do on the order of a billion queries a day, and we're basically not even trying,' he said.

Moving forward: He listed the Android app and improved search capabilities as two areas that the company is currently working on

What he said the company is interested in looking at are the way that Facebook can use the information about the user's friends and experiences to tailor the search. He gave the example of how can Facebook help a user find what sushi places their friends have been to in New York? Or what friends work at a particular company where the user wants to apply for a job?

'Facebook is uniquely positioned to give you answers,' he said.

He gave nods to tech start ups like vacation home rental Airbnb, Spotify, and Instagram. Considering Zuckerberg was the one behind Facebook's $1billion acquisition of the photo-sharing service, it comes as little surprise that he said they were 'killing it'.

While he remained upbeat and focused on the company's positive future in light of the discouraging IPO, he pointedly deflected to his dedication to the company's mission when asked if he was still having fun.

'For me it's not really about fun. It's about mission. It goes through waves. There are times when everyone thinks what we're doing is awesome. There are times when everyone is pessimistic. I would rather be in the cycle where people underestimate us. I would rather be underestimated. It gives us freedom to go out and do interesting stuff,' he said.

'When you look back 10 or 20 years from now, the legacy of this company should be that we've connected everyone in the world and they can share what they want.'
