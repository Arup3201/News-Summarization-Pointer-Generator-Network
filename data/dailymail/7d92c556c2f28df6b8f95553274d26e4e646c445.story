Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has been told to improve his touchline behaviour after his foul-mouthed insult aimed at Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini.

Pardew escaped disciplinary action, but an FA spokesman said: ‘We have been in contact with Alan Pardew and reminded him of his responsibilities.’

Pardew, 52, was caught on camera calling Pellegrini  a ‘f****** old c***’ during City’s 2-0 win at St James’ Park on Sunday.

His verbal assault on the 60-year-old 
Chilean came as tempers flared after Cheick Tiote’s first-half strike 
was controversially chalked off by referee Mike Jones, who ruled that 
Yoan Gouffran had been in an offside position.

Jones
 will be back in the North East this weekend, though not taking charge 
of a game - he is fourth official for Southampton’s trip to  Sunderland.

Former Premier League official Alan Wiley, now a refereeing coach, last
 night described Jones’s decision as ‘an error of judgment’ and added: 
‘We can all see that the player is not in front of the goalkeeper and 
the goal should have stood but, from where Mike Jones was stood, he 
thought he was (impeding).’

Although
 the FA are still awaiting Jones’s official report of the game, which 
will include the observations of fourth official Martin Atkinson, they 
took the unusual step yesterday of issuing a statement that Pardew would
 not face any punishment over his behaviour.

Pardew, who has been fined 
previously for incidents at St James’ Park, has been sent a letter by 
the FA and warned about his conduct.

The outburst at Pellegrini was clearly caught live on camera in the televised clash.

Pardew,
 who was mortified that the incident had been picked up, said he had 
spoken to the City boss afterwards, and also offered apologies in his 
press conference.

Pardew said: ‘It was a heat of the moment thing, words
 we always have as managers, to a degree. I’ve apologised and I’m 
fortunate that he’s accepted that.

‘I
 have apologised for that particular word. We always tease each other 
and have words. What he said to me is going to remain private, but it 
didn’t merit my response.’

Pardew,
 who returns to former club West Ham with Newcastle this weekend, was 
also careful with his criticism of Jones’s decision to disallow Tiote’s 
goal and will be hopeful those comments have not landed him in further 
hot water.

Big call: Tiote (right) claims that he doesn't understand why his goal was chalked off

Pellegrini clearly could not understand all the fuss about the disallowed goal.

‘It was a valid decision,’ said the City boss directly after the game. ‘The player was clearly offside.’

City’s former Newcastle midfielder James Milner said Hart had been 
impeded by the presence of Gouffran, who shifted out of the way of 
Tiote’s shot.

Milner said: 
‘Harty says that although he wasn’t blocking his view of the ball he was
 standing where he was going to dive, so he couldn’t really make a dive.

‘If
 someone is in your way you are not going to dive on them. Maybe he 
wasn’t interfering but it is such a hard one to get right. I can see the
 point for both sides.’

City
 were also unhappy with referee Jones for failing to send off Newcastle 
defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa for a late and wild tackle on Samir Nasri, 
who left St James’ with his left knee in a brace.

Pellegrini
 added: ‘His injury is very serious. It was a very unfair kick. It was a
 red card. I don’t understand why he was not sent off.’
