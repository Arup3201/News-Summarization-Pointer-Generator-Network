One of two brothers being investigated by federal prosecutors in the case of a Georgia teenager found dead in a rolled-up gym mat has had his alibi confirmed by local police.

Classmates found the body of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the middle of a mat propped upright against the wall of the gym at Lowndes High School on January 11, 2013.

Sheriff's investigators concluded that the teenager died in a freak accident, but a second autopsy found the cause of death was blunt force trauma.

Classmates found the body of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, in the middle of a mat propped upright against the wall of the gym at Lowndes High School on January 11, 2013

Johnson’s parents have long insisted that there son was murdered and in July they filed a lawsuit in Lowndes County Superior Court that stated that their son died ‘at the hands of one or more students.’

Two brothers, whose names have been withheld because they were juveniles at the time of incident, received letters from the U.S. Attorney’s Office informing them they were 'target(s) of the grand jury’s investigation.'

The boys - described as 'white and affluent' by AJC - had been linked to the case because the youngest sibling had been involved in a 2011 scuffle with Johnson.

Lowndes County sheriff’s deputies released a report confirming the alibi of the older of the two brothers earlier this week.

The report concludes that the oldest boy had left the school grounds an hour before Johnson was last seen on school surveillance tapes because he was taking part in a wrestling tournament in Macon.

Lawyers for Johnson’s parents had last month produced a copy of a bus reservation that listed a 4 p.m. departure time for a wrestling tournament in which the older brother was competing — roughly three hours after Johnson was last seen alive.

But the police report included interviews with the school’s wrestling coach, the bus driver and several teammates who all insisted that they left Valdosta around lunchtime.

Wrestling coach Spencer Graybeal told police the form was submitted with an estimated departure time three months before the tournament and that it was later amended on learning that the wrestlers were due in Macon -152 miles away - at 4 p.m. for weigh-ins.

The Johnsons are seeking to hold the county school board, school superintendent and the principal of Lowndes High School responsible for their son's death.

Their lawsuit mentions that Johnson had been in a fight with another student during a bus trip to a football game a year before his death.

It also blames school officials for not interviewing classmates 'who witnessed incidents of harassment and threats' against Johnson.

The state medical examiner had ruled Johnson’s death an accident caused by positional asphyxia, supporting local law enforcement’s theory that the teen got trapped while reaching for a pair of sneakers 

The lawsuit doesn't specifically allege that the same student who fought with Johnson - the wrestler’s younger brother - had a role in his death.

He was in class and accounted for when Johnson was seen entering the gym where his body would later be discovered. 

Johnson's parents are seeking unspecified monetary damages from the school system. 

A federal investigation in Johnson’s death remains active. The Lowndes sheriff’s office has confirmed that Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines recently retrieved the mat where Johnson’s body was found.
