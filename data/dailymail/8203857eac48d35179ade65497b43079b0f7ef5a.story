Found: Adela Copakova was found in Bradford three days after she went missing in Sheffield

Three men have been arrested over the disappearance of a teenage girl who was found today after going missing on Sunday.

Adela Copakova, 14, went missing from her home in Sheffield on Sunday, sparking a police search and public alert.

The teenager was discovered 30 miles away in Bradford this morning.

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said that three men had been arrested over the case, but did not specify the nature of their alleged involvement.

'Earlier this morning missing 14-year-old Adela Copakova was found in Bradford,' he said.

'Three men have been arrested in connection with her disappearance.'

Adela, who is Slovakian, was reported missing on Sunday evening after she was last seen outside a house in Twentywell Lane, Sheffield, at about 8pm.

Senior police officers said yesterday they were concerned for her safety and did not know why she had gone missing.

Her disappearance came just a week after the very similar case of another teenage girl who is also of Slovakian descent.

The 13-year-old likewise went missing in Sheffield before being found in Bradford a week later.

Six people were arrested on suspicion of child abduction in the previous case.

South Yorkshire Police say they have not found evidence that the two girls' cases are linked.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
