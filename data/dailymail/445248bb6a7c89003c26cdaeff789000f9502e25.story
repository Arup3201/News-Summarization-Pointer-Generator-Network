They say the referee has had a good game if he has not been noticed and many times this season, that was true.

However, inevitably there were decisions which put the referee in the spotlight, usually for the wrong reasons.

These were the season's five most contentious incidents...

Andre Marriner sent off Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Chelsea in March 2014 after the winger handled the ball to stop what he thought would have been a goal for the hosts.

Anthony Taylor allowed Chelsea’s goal against Cardiff City when Samuel Eto’o kicked the ball away from Cardiff keeper David Marshall when he was in the process of clearing it upfield. The ball is considered within the control of the goalkeeper even when he throws it from his hand to drop kick it.

Jon Moss awarded Manchester United a penalty against Crystal Palace for a Kagisho Dikgacoi challenge on Ashley Young which was clearly outside the area.

Not spot on: Jon Moss awarded a penalty for this foul by Kagisho Dikgacoi on Ashley Young despite the fact it was outside the area

Mike
 Jones disallowed Cheick Tiote's perfectly good goal against Manchester 
City for offside by ruling that Yoan Gouffran had got a slight touch on 
the ball when he had not. A player must touch the ball to be considered
 to be interfering with play. Jones was then affected for the rest of 
the game and badly misjudged Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa’s shocking challenge on Samir Nasri 
which should have been a red card – perhaps the worst of the season.

Assistant referee Scott Ledger made two wrong calls in Tottenham’s defeat by Manchester City. Firstly he indicated a foul and a penalty when Danny Rose clearly played the ball when challenging Edin Dzeko and was wrongly dismissed. He then flagged for offside and had a perfectly good goal Michael Dawson goal disallowed - both helped City to victory.

Disallowed: But this Michael Dawson goal for Spurs against Manchester City should have stood

Mike Riley publicly criticising Andre Marriner and apologising on his behalf to West Brom manager Steve Clarke after Marriner awarded Chelsea a penalty after Ramires dived. Whilst Marriner was clearly wrong and was ‘conned’ by the Brazilians dive it can’t be good for an individual referee to be highlighted by his boss – team managers would not do it.

1. Mark Clattenburg - who is the best natural referee who can get the most out of a game with his approach and attitude towards advantage. Once again controversy followed him with 'Lallanagate' this season after the race allegations from 'Mikelgate' from last season. He survives because he is so good on the field but needs to take care that he doesn’t push the friendly approach too far.

Official No 1: Mark Clattenburg has been the best referee in the country this season

2. Michael Oliver - who matures with every performance. Refereeing the Manchester derby, Liverpool’s 5-1 demolition of Arsenal and the north London derby without problems shows great development. He will be No 1 it’s just a case of when.

3. Mike Dean - continues to perform consistently well in the big games despite coming off the FIFA list at the end of 2013 due to age restrictions. Arsenal v Chelsea and Manchester City v Chelsea went well. Even Jose Mourinho congratulated Dean after losing to Sunderland! Refs can never please everybody.

4. Martin Atkinson - returned to good form and was rewarded with a lot of key appointments – refereeing the Liverpool vs Chelsea game with huge common sense was his highlight for me as this game perhaps affected the title more than others and went without a single issue.

Reward: Martin Atkinson (left) has been given key matches, while Howard Webb will go to the World Cup

5. Howard Webb - had a really interesting season – fantastic in Europe but indecisive in Premier League games. He has the World Cup finals to officiate at and then a summer of reflection and perhaps retirement. Whatever you think of him he would be sorely missed for his presence on a list short of quality in depth.

6. Anthony Taylor – recovered after a poor start and is a solid and safe referee for most PL games.

7. Chris Foy – steady referee whose experience gets him through most games.

8. Phil Dowd – started the season in great form helped by his huge weight loss last summer. As the weight has gone back on the performances have dipped – refereeing is about fitness and positioning.

Not fit enough: Phil Dowd, here sending off Paul Dummett, has seen his form dip as his weight increased

9. Andre Marriner – A real mixed bag from Marriner who gaffed with the Gibbs/Oxlade-Chamberlain dismissal and the Ramires penalty against West Brom. Still a good referee but not his best season.

10. Kevin Friend – Had the pleasure of sending Alan Pardew off for that butt but appears to have lost the support of the PGMO to handle any big games.
