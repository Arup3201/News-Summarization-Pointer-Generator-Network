Disgraced baseball player Ryan Braun has married his model girlfriend Larisa Fraser this weekend.

The Milwaukee Brewers outfielder was suspended for several months during the Major League season this year, after admitting that an overturned positive performance-enhancement drug test in 2011 had been accurate.

On Saturday, the 30-year-old married his 24-year-old partner in a family ceremony in Malibu, California.

Ms Fraser, the new Mrs Braun, is originally from Toronto Canada but now lives in Los Angeles where she works as a fashion model and food blogger, running the popular website Model Eats.

She wrote on her blog: ‘Saturday I married the man of my dreams.

'It was perfect. Thanks to everyone for celebrating with us and for all of the well wishes!’

Braun won the National League MVP in 2011, but his image and reputation has been tarnished since his 2011 urine test which concluded a raised level of testosterone.

The raised levels were ruled to have been caused by a performance-enhancing drug and Braun faced a 50-game suspension.

However, Braun appealed the positive 
test in January 2012 and it was overturned by an arbitration panel after
 questions were raised regarding the way the urine sample had been 
handled.

In February 2013, 
it was revealed that Braun's name appeared in the records of a Miami 
clinic which allegedly distributed performance-enhancing drugs to 
several baseball players, including Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez.

As
 a result, this season, Braun only managed 61 games before he was 
suspended on July 22, for the remainder of the season for violations of 
the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.

'Valued': Ryan Braun was voted Most Valuable Player in 2011, the year he took performance-enhancing drugs

In August Ryan Braun admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs during his NL MVP season of 2011, saying he took a cream and a lozenge containing banned substances while rehabilitating an injury.

'It was a huge mistake for which I am deeply ashamed and I compounded the situation by not admitting my mistakes immediately,' Braun said in a statement released by the Brewers.

Braun, who has a Jewish father and a Catholic mother and identifies as Jewish and was last year named as number five on a list of 'the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world', by Shalom Life.
