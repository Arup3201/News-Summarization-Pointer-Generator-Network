Gus Poyet has vowed to fight on as Sunderland boss but says he understands supporters storming the dugout during their shambolic 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa.

Disgruntled fans were prevented from getting to the head coach by stewards after the visitors raced into a four-goal lead before the break and a policeman remained close to Poyet until half-time.

The result leaves the Black Cats one place above the relegation zone and with just one win in 12 matches.

Poyet – who is now the bookmakers’ odds-on favourite to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job – concedes his position is under scrutiny and does not know if owner Ellis Short will demand to see him before the weekend is out.

He does, though, insist he will not walk way.

‘That (quitting) is not in question. It would be too easy to blame everyone else,’ he said.

‘I am responsible. I am one of the few in football who is honest – I am responsible when we do well and I am responsible when we do not.

‘I hate people who pick and choose and have too many faces.’

At least three supporters tried to break through stewards guarding the dugout and thousands more streamed for the exits after two-goal Gabriel Agbonlahor scored Villa’s third on 37 minutes. Christian Benteke headed his second and Villa’s fourth before the interval.

And Poyet said: ‘I would do the same. It was quite alright. They did what they had to do, it was not acceptable.

‘It was probably the worst 45 minutes of my time here. I have no explanation for what happened in the first half.

‘I’m extremely disappointed and shocked. I was not expecting that to happen.’

One incident which typified Sunderland’s embarrassing afternoon was the sight of them playing the first four minutes of the second half with just 10 men.

Seb Larsson was in the dressing-room having treatment on a leg injury when the action got back underway and home fans soon sang, ‘We’ve only got 10 men’.

Poyet, though, was angry when the comments of BBC pundit Chris Sutton were relayed to him after the game.

‘I saw something which accused us of being a pub team and Seb Larsson having a fag in the car park,’ fumed the South American.

‘Seb Larsson is one of the biggest professionals we have at club. He had a massive cut in his leg and he didn’t want to come off. We asked the referee to delay the kick-off but it was not possible and he came eventually come out.

‘So people have to be careful what they write because Seb is a fantastic professional.’

Tim Sherwood, meanwhile, backed his former Spurs team-mate to recover from the humiliating loss.

‘It’s not great what you get beat heavily at home but Gus will bounce back. He’s got a big heart,’ said Sherwood, whose side leapfrogged the Black Cats into 16th and moved six points clear of the drop zone.
