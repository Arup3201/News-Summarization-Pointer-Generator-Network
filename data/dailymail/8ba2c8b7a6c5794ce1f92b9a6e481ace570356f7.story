Keith Ambrey (pictured) died after he stumbled into the road and was hit by Joseph Wild’s 4x4

An elderly driver, who ran over a disabled man, dumped his body at the side of the road and then lied that his victim had been hit by a taxi, has been jailed.

Keith Ambrey, who had Motor Neurone Disease, suffered fatal injuries after he stumbled into the road and was hit by Joseph Wild’s 4x4 in the early hours of March 23 last year.

Mr Ambrey had missed his train stop after a night out in Manchester and was walking home when he collapsed onto the carriageway at New Mills Newtown in Derbyshire.

Derby Crown Court heard other drivers saw an object in their headlights but Wild, 74, who was driving home from a casino in the early hours, hit 61-year-old Mr Ambrey after thinking he was a bin bag.

When the farmer and businessman, realised what had happened, he dragged Mr Ambrey’s lifeless body to the side of the road and lied about what happened.

Shockingly, Wild made no attempt to seek help before abandoning Mr Ambrey and driving home to bed.

He has now been handed a 17-month jail sentence after committing the ‘grotesque act’.

The court heard Mr Ambrey, who was the former chief executive of Central Manchester Primary Health Care Trust, suffered from advanced MND.

On the night of the tragedy, he had been out with friends in Manchester before making his way home to Hazel Grove, near Stockport, on the last train at 11.10pm.

His companions said they did not consider him to be drunk.

But after he missed his stop, he waited until Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire, to get off the train.

He was seen walking home along the A6 at New Mills Newtown some three miles away.

At around 1.30am, a couple had driven past on the other side of the road and saw Mr Ambrey fall and hit his head. But he sat up in the road and appeared to be searching for his glasses.

Seconds later, Wild's large Mitsubishi Shogun passed them heading towards him.

Another driver flashed his headlights when he saw the vehicle approaching. He thought it would stop, but the driver made no attempt to slow down or steer around the object.

The court heard the car drove over it and dragged what looked like 'a dummy' along before it came to a stop and a man got out.

Julia King, prosecuting, said said: 'Ultimately and tragically he stumbled into the road and fell and was hit by Wild's car.'

Moments later, John Redfearn drove past Wild's 4x4 and after seeing a badly injured man, he quickly turned his car round and went back to the scene.

'He saw Wild standing next to his car,' said Ms King.

'When Mr Redfearn asked what had happened, Wild said he had found the body and dragged it to the side of the road.'

Wild had asked Mr Redfearn if he had a phone, who ‘in his panic’ had forgotten he had his mobile with him, she added.

But after driving off, he called police to report what he had seen.

And by the time another motorist passed the scene and saw the body, Wild was nowhere to be seen.

He had stopped for just two-and-a-half minutes before leaving the scene.

Police pieced together evidence from witnesses and CCTV footage, tracing Wild to his farmhouse 12 hours later.

He told officers he had seen the body in the road and thought it was a bin bag – and added it was only when he stopped that he realised it was a man, who he said was cold so must have been dead for some time.

Wild had also falsely claimed a taxi had stopped and he spoke to the driver, who said he would ring 999, before he eventually drove off.

Ms King added: 'It's highly improbable he engaged in conversation with any taxi driver. Despite an appeal, no taxi driver ever came forward.'

Mr Ambrey was pronounced dead at the scene.

A post-mortem examination found he had died instantly from severe head and body injuries. It also emerged that Mr Ambrey was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition, which was probably what had caused him to collapse into the road.

It was established that he could not have been there any longer than 45 seconds.

Wild's car was travelling at or just above the 30mph, which investigators said would have given him at least five seconds to stop or take evasive action.

The injuries showed that the 4x4 had run right over Mr Ambrey and dragged him just 12 yards down the carriageway.

In mitigation, David Toal said neither speed nor alcohol were a factor in the 'sad tragic event', but he admitted Wild's later actions 'aggravated' what had taken place.

'Everyone has made a mistake and almost always they don't result in any consequences let alone the death of an individual,' he said.

'His mistake cost the life of Mr Ambrey and he will have to live with that for the rest of his life.

'He cannot explain what he did afterwards, but he understands it was totally wrong and why Mr Ambrey's family feel like they do.'

He said Wild, of Chinley, Derbyshire, was a well-respected member of his local community, who had worked hard all his life running his family's farm and butcher's business.

The judge described Mr Ambrey as 'a kind and generous man' who was dealing with advanced MND with 'characteristic courage'.

He accepted nothing he could say would bring his family any comfort.

Judge Gosling told Wild his actions 'beggared belief'.

He said: 'If events had taken a different turn his family could have perhaps forgiven you but they can never come to terms with what you did next.

'There is nothing to suggest you are a callous man, you were in deep shock and now you have expressed your remorse.

'But that cannot excuse what you did. Grotesquely you dragged his body to the side of the road and there you left him.'

The judge added: 'You made a conscious decision to drive off, confident that you would not be traced and if you were you could maintain the lie.

'It absolutely beggars belief you could leave Mr Ambrey where he was and you could drive home, make no call to anyone and go to bed.

'You either did not think about or care about who happened upon the scene that you left behind. Those people did what they could to give him some dignity.'

Wild, who pleaded guilty to causing Mr Ambrey's death by careless driving on March 23 last year and failing to report an accident, was told he must serve at least half his sentence in jail.

Passing sentence, Judge Gosling added: 'You lied and said the body was cold and that you had found it in the road. You also lied about the taxi driver and that you had done what you could, and then left the scene.

'I'm afraid they were all calculated lies.'
