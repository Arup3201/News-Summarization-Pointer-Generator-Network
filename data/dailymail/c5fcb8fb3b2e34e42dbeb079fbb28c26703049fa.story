An unemployed fitness fanatic who spends four hours a day working out says he claims benefits because he is 'too fit to work'.

Kamran Kam, from East London, who receives £72.50 per week in Jobseeker's Allowance, says he has stopped looking for a 9-5 job because the 'boring' lifestyle would interfere with his strict regime.  

The 25-year-old even believes the super-fit should receive extra government handouts for staying in shape so they can be 'free of everyday work'.

Fitness fanatic and martial arts addict Kamran Kam, from East London, trains for four hours per day and claims he does not have time to look for a job

And he believes his lifestyle is less strain on government resources than those 'overweight people' who are unable to work and 'spend all their benefits on junk food and cigarettes'.

Mr Kam - who already gets half-price gym membership because he is unemployed - said: 'I've had all sorts of jobs, from admin and customer service work, to kitchen and security placements. The problem was, all the positions were way too boring for me.

'Not only that, I wasn't happy about paying taxes that go towards people who are sitting at home all day and making no contribution to society - especially overweight people who spend all their benefits on junk food and cigarettes. 

'I, on the other hand, am extremely dedicated to my fitness, and I simply don't have time to waste spending all day doing a monotonous job, so in November last year I decided to give up work altogether.

'I am now happy to say I'm too busy staying fit, doing Kung Fu and loving life to get a 9-5.'

He added: 'I don't see why someone of my fitness level and talent should be wasted in an office or shop.' 

Mr Kam, who lives with his mother and 27-year-old brother, currently claims £72.40 a week in JSA.

But he openly admits that he is making no effort to get a job, believing that fit people should not have to pay taxes that go towards treating overweight people on the NHS. 

Mr Kam, pictured with Martial Artist Silvio Simac, said his mother wants him to get a 'normal, boring job' but that life is too short to 'conform to society'

He said: 'That's part of the reason I refuse to get a 9-5 job- why should I have to sacrifice my own fitness levels to help pay for lazy people that sit on their backsides eating all day? 

'I know some people might say I should go and get a 9-5 job and stop claiming benefits, but I'd bet most of those people cost just as much in NHS fees as I do on JSA.

'At the end of the day, I can't remember the last time I went to the doctors, and I live with my mum so I'm not asking for housing either.  

'I'm not saying all fat people choose to be that way, but in reality a large proportion of the people who claim benefits are totally wasting government money and have no ambition at all. 

'What I'm doing with my life is far more of a testament to my country than pen pushing all day in some office job I don't enjoy.' 

He added that the government should give him extra money for staying in shape.

'The government should give free gym membership and fitness courses - but only to the super-fit,' he said.

'It should be totally free really- when you think the government spends £5bn a year on tackling obesity it's absurd that fit people have to pay anything at all to stay in shape. 

'They should also work out a system that enables fit people to be free of everyday work if they are tied down in a boring job such as customer service or retail.

'If they have a fitness-related job I believe they should be asked to keep working.

'If more people were fit and healthy the government would save millions of pounds every year- even after paying out JSA and housing benefits.' 

The unemployed sportsman says he does have plans to make money in the future and is pursuing a career on the silver screen

Mr Kam says that his mother Rahela, who works in child care, wishes he would get 'a normal, boring job' but that life is too short to 'conform to what society wants you to do'.

He said: 'Life is too short to do something you don't enjoy- it's not all about working- it's more important to be fit and healthy and to look great as well.

'When I look at myself in the mirror and see my body I feel great. 

'That is worth far more than going out and earning money just to conform to what society wants you to do.'  

He added: 'I am totally independent, driven, and self-sufficient, and I'm fortunate enough to be receiving free Kung Fu lessons from a top Chinese Kung Fu master.

'For me to go to work everyday and stop practising my art would be a total waste of talent.'

Mr Kam says he does intend to earn money one day and wants to make his name as a martial arts actor on the silver screen.

He said: 'A lot of people call me Jean-Claude Van Damme, because I can perform a lot of the moves he does and I'm told I look like him too.

'I'd love to get a part in a Kung Fu movie one day- that's my ultimate goal.

He added: 'You have to makes sacrifices if you want to make a real impact on the world, and for me that means training at least five times a week for 3-4 hours each session.

'It can be physically tough, but at least I don't have to put my energy into anything else so I can focus on it 100 per cent.' 

Mr Kam has been learning Kung Fu ever since he first developed an admiration for Bruce Lee as a young boy. He also trains with weights in the gym, something he has been doing since he was 18.

He trains in Muay Thai, Karate, Boxing and now Kung Fu.
