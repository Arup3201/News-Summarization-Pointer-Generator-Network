Team news

Arsenal

Arsene Wenger has welcomed a trio of players back into his squad ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League visit of Stoke.

Aaron Ramsey (hamstring) and Mesut Ozil (knee) are all available, as is striker Olivier Giroud who returns following suspension.

Mesut Ozil (centre) is tracked by Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Ryan Mason earlier this season and the Arsenal midfielder could make his first appearance for three months after recovering from injury

Wenger will also have to decide whether to recall Wojciech Szczesny after David Ospina deputised in the FA Cup third round win over Hull, while Danny Welbeck (thigh), Mikel Arteta, Abou Diaby (both calf) and Jack Wilshere (ankle) are still absent.

Provisional squad: Szczesny, Ospina, Monreal, Chambers, Koscielny, Mertesacker, Bellerin, Debuchy, Coquelin, Ramsey, Flamini, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez, Campbell, Akpom, Maitland-Niles.

Stoke

Stoke boss Mark Hughes has a trio of players on the brink of a return from injury ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Defender Marc Muniesa, midfielder Victor Moses and striker Bojan Krkic are in Hughes' squad, although the Welshman is wary of pushing any of the three back into the fray ahead of time.

Bojan Krkic looks set to return for Stoke at Arsenal but it's uncertain if the Spaniard will start

Germany international defender Philipp Wollscheid is also available after signing on loan for the rest of the season from Bayer Leverkusen, but Marc Wilson is a doubt with a knee problem, while striker Mame Biram Diouf is on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Butland, Shawcross, Muniesa, Wilson, Huth, Pieters, Bardsley, Wollscheid, Cameron, Nzonzi, Adam, Whelan, Walters, Arnautovic, Assaidi, Crouch, Palacios, Moses, Krkic.

Arsenal have fielded 12 different starting back four combinations in the Premier League this season.

Mark Hughes has never won a Premier League game away at Arsenal as an opposition coach, losing all seven visits (with five different clubs).
