It was the Japanese car-maker whose generously equipped, modestly priced and most reliable vehicles began the assault on slapdash British cars in the Seventies and sounded the death-knell for the UK-owned motor industry.

But just as it made its mark in revolutionising the UK car market, the name of Datsun then drifted from view as the firm from the land of the Rising Sun transformed itself into Nissan  - and built a state of the art car factory in Sunderland.

But now after a gap of  more than a quarter of a century the Datsun name is bouncing back as a ‘budget’ brand for parent company Nissan which set out plans for a new small, reliable, affordable  and ‘green’  car bearing the Datsun badge.

Roll out: Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn made the announcement today while in Indonesia - one of three markets alongside India and Russia, where the Datsun will go on sale from 2014

Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn made the announcement yesterday while in Indonesia -one of three markets alongside India and Russia, where the Datsun will go on sale from 2014.

But if the idea catches on there is the possibility that  budget-priced Datsuns could again be running on UK and other European roads.

Mr Ghosn said the first of the new generation Datsuns – initially built in Indonesia - would go back to the firm’s origins: ‘It’s a green car, affordable car, small displacement, high local content. It’s going to be a generous car.’

Popular choice: At their peak in the 1970s  Datsun cars sold in Britain came keenly priced, packed with up-to-the-minute technology that would be a costly extra on British and European built cars. A Cherry 100A model, pictured, cost £765

Sport Datsun: A rakish 240Z sport coupe. pictured, cost £2,389, but after a wind-down period when cars were badged 'Datsun by Nissan', the last cars to bear the Datsun name were the Stanza and Bluebird in 1985

At their peak in the 1970s  Datsun cars sold in Britain came keenly priced, packed with up-to-the-minute technology that would be a costly extra on British and European built cars.

Standard features included a heated rear screen, two-speed wipers, a dual band radio and reclining seats which were initially vinyl before being replaced in late 1976-77 by half vinyl-half cloth.

Adverts from 1976, when Datsun had an incredible  6per cent share of the UK car market, show  a Cherry 100A model costing £765 and a rakish 240Z sport coupe at £2,389.

After a wind-down period when cars were badged ‘Datsun by Nissan’, the last cars to bear the Datsun name were the Stanza and Bluebird in 1985.

Update: The company introduced the Nissan Z Concept at the 1999 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The goal of the design,  was 'to take some of the elements of the original car and incorporate them into a totally new design'

Most importantly, as the UK car 
industry reeled under the onslaught of British Leyland’s militant car 
workers, walk outs and strikes instigated by the likes of Derek ‘Red 
Robbo’ Robinson, and declining levels of quality and workmanship,

Frustrated
 British buyers were ripe for the hassle free Japanese cars. The Datsun 
Cherry was the car used by many driving schools and launched many 
L-plated earner drivers.

The
 sporty 240Z coupe gained a reputation as ‘the poor man’s E-Type’ and 
sold phenomenally well. For the family there was the sedate Datsun 
Laurel.

Datsun made its
 debut in Japan in 1931 when it was created by the DAT Motorcar Company.
 Two years later it was taken over by  Nissan.  But the Datsun title 
survived and was the name by which Nissan initially sold its cars in the
 UK.

New and old: A new Nissan Juke car model leaves the showroom building in Jakarta today after Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn announced the Japanese automaker company Nissan will revive its old and affordable brand Datsun

The Datsun name died completely in 1986 coinciding with the opening of the new UK factory in Sunderland building the Nissan Bluebird.

Jay Nagley, managing director at the consultancy Redspy Automotive said:’It is ironic, as Nissan spent 10 years in the 1980s trying to get rid of Datsun.

‘Nissan wants to create a low cost brand without giving Nissan cars a low cost image.’

‘It’s becoming quite common for car makers to develop low cost brands. Renault has been successful with Dacia, Volkswagen with Skoda.

Earlier this month Nissan announced at the Geneva Motor Show that it is to create more than 2,000 new British jobs to build a brand  new family car at its UK car factory in  Sunderland.  

The Japanese car giant is to invest £125million with the taxpayer pumping in nearly £10million more  in regional support to manufacture a new car called ‘Invitation’ which was unveiled at the Show by Business Secretary Vince Cable.
