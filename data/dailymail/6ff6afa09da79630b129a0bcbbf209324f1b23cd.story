Chelsea are weighing up a bid in the region of £27m for Colombian star Juan Cuadrado as they expect to lose either Andre Schurrle or Mohamed Salah.

Fiorentina's Cuadrado has also been linked with Manchester United since his outstanding performances at the World Cup last summer.

But who is the flying winger who has struck fear into the hearts of so many defenders over the last couple of years?

Name: Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello

Age: 26

Position: Winger

Teams: Fiorentina and Colombia

Where do I recognise his name from?

Most likely from last summer's World Cup in Brazil and his integral part in that vibrant Colombia team that reached the quarter-finals.

While James Rodriguez was the undoubted star, Cuadrado also made a name for himself with his performances of the right wing in Jose Pekerman's team, combining a bold, direct approach, lightning pace and lethal crossing.

He registered four asissts during the tournament, putting him joint-top of the ranking with Germany's Toni Kroos, who played in two more matches.

Two of those came as Greece were swept aside 3-0 in Colombia's opening group match and Cuadrado also scored a penalty in the third group game, a 4-1 win over Japan.

And in the last-16 clash with Uruguay, after Rodriguez had scored his award-winning volley, Cuadrado soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second.

To followers of Italian football, these performances came as little surprise following a stellar season at Fiorentina as Cuadrado helped them to fourth place and a spot in the Europa League, realising his potential in spectacular style.

Whereabouts does he play?

Cuadrado is a versatile player, capable of performing on either wing. He can also fit in as a wing back, right back or even centre forward if required.

Indeed, he played as a centre forward earlier in his career and his idol growing up was Brazilian hero Ronaldo.

These days, he is stationed on the right wing as this allows him to inflict most damage.

What are his strengths?

Blistering pace is Cuadrado's main asset, as plenty of dizzy defenders have found out when it's already too late.

Indeed, the 26-year-old was given the nickname 'Vespa' by his former Fiorentina team-mate Luca Toni because of the ways he nips between defenders like the ubiquitous scooters between cars on Italian city streets.

The right wing is his highway and with his direct approach, close control and accurate crossing, Cuadrado would be a real asset for any team.

His athleticism also enabled him to withstand a fair deal of punishment - defenders don't take kindly to the type of humiliation Cuadrado doles out and, as one of Serie A's most-fouled players, needs resiliance.

One aspect of his game that has improved is his finishing, as shown by the 15 goals he scored for Fiorentina last season, a three-fold increase on the campaign before that.

Speaking in 2013, Cuadrado revealed how he'd worked hard at improving this aspect of hs game.

'I spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training,' he said. 'Who knows how angry the goalkeepers Neto and (Cristiano) Lupatelli are at having to hang back with me before they're able to hit the showers.'

What's his background?

Cuadrado was born in the coastal town of Necocli, which is one of the oldest settlements in Colombia, though he was raised further south in the city of Tumaco.

His father, Guillermo, a truck driver, was shot dead when he was just five years old. Speaking on a Colombian interview show, his mother Marcela said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football.

Playing as a forward, Cuadrado started out at Atletico Uraba but on the recommendation of the club's founder Nelson Gallego, he was moved to the wing.

After a brief spell at second division side Rionegro, where he mostly languished on the bench, he was signed by Independiente Medellin, one of the country's biggest clubs, in 2008.

Cuadrado scored on his debut against Boyaca Chico and the wheels were soon in motion.

Italian jobs

Cuadrado only actually spent one season at Independiente. He attracted interest from Italian clubs and duly joined Udinese on a five-year contract in July 2009.

Opportunities were initially limited for the 21-year-old, who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second, failing to score a goal in either.

A change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow Serie A side Lecce for the 2011-12 campaign.

With more regular football, Cuadrado started to show his talents, scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances.

It wasn't enough to keep Lecce in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of Fiorentina. They paid £4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in Cuadrado.

The winger became a popular figure at Lecce for his dance celebrations with team-mate Luis Muriel 

In his first season at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, he opened his account in a 4-1 win over Cagliari and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the Viola finished fourth.

But 2013-14 was his breakthrough season, with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions.

The most important came against his former club Udinese in the semi-final, second leg of the Coppa Italia, securing a 3-2 aggregate success and a place in the final against Napoli (which they lost 3-1).

His profile boosted by the World Cup, Cuadrado has continued to excel and has five goals and three asssits this season so far.

International honours

Cuadrado earned his first international call-up for Colombia a year after his transfer to Udinese, playing and scoring against Venezuela in September 2010.

Since then, he has been a regular in the side, with 37 caps and five goals to his name.
