'No remorse': Leroy Brown blackmailed Steven Aldridge and went on to target his victim's family in arson attacks

An arsonist has been jailed for blackmailing a wealthy property developer and torching two desirable London mews houses in a 'relentless' campaign aimed at his victim's family and business.

Leroy Brown didn't know Steven Aldridge but he made his life a misery for more than two years, setting fire to properties the businessman had developed before moving on to target the homes of his parents and sister.

But he was put behind bars indefinitely today after a jury at Maidstone Crown Court found him guilty of blackmail and arson.

A judge ordered that Brown, 34, of Hanwell, west London, should serve at least eight-and-a-half years before becoming eligible for parole.

Police believe that, from 2009, Brown and unknown accomplices bombarded Mr Aldridge with menacing phone calls and distributed threatening letters demanding cash payments of up to £56,000 at a time.

At the time Mr Aldridge was a successful property developer living in south-west London.

Brown's campaign escalated in April 2010 when he resorted to arson attacks, torching two mews houses that Mr Aldridge had developed in South Kensington in London.

The arsonist struck again in May 2011, first starting a fire at what he thought was the victims' parents home in Rainham, Kent.

But he got the wrong address and instead attacked the home of an innocent neighbour, damaging the front of the house and a car parked outside.

Ten days later, Brown torched the home of Mr Aldridge's sister and caused damage to her car.

Mr Aldridge reported the matter to detectives and Brown was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of blackmail on June 29 last year.

But he was later bailed, and went on to set fire to Mr Aldridge's parents' home and send the businessman another threatening letter.

On July 26 last year, Brown was arrested by officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate.

He denied any involvement with Mr Aldridge, but was found guilty of blackmail and five counts of arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered.

Dc Wayne Totterdell, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: 'This was a relentless and prolonged attempt to blackmail a businessman using an escalating series of threats and acts against the victim, his family, and their property.'

'Brown, who was unknown to the victim, was prepared to go to great lengths in order to obtain a large sum of money from him.

'Having initially failed to achieve this through threats, harassment, and acts of damage, he went on to commit a series of arson attacks culminating in the targeting of the victim’s extended family in Kent.

'These actions clearly demonstrated that Brown was willing put the lives of the victim, his family, and members of the public at risk in pursuit of securing financial gain.

'Following the arson attacks in Kent, we acted swiftly to arrest Brown, secure evidence, and end the ordeal that he had put the victim and his family through.'

The detective added that Brown had shown 'no remorse'.

'The offence of Blackmail is a psychological crime aimed at intimidating victims into co-operating with the demands being made,' he said.
