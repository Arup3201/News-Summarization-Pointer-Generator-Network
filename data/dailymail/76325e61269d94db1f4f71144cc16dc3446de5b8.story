An armed robber was caught after he dropped his gun and took off his balaclava to pick it up after attempting to hold up a London betting shop.

It was as if the dozy robber had directly copied the move from Guy Ritchie's comedy 'Snatch' where two robbers remove their masks immediately after a flopped raid at a bookmakers.

Derek Rossi, 58, tried to hold up the Ladbrokes in Holborn with a sawn-off shotgun hidden in an umbrella.

Fail: Criminal Derek Rossi robbed a north London betting shop and then took off his balaclava outside in front of dozens of witnesses. Pictured here is a balaclava discovered at Rossi's home in Finsbury Park, north London

He carried out the attempted burglary at 8am on Monday November 4 last year at the betting shop located in the busy business area.

When staff could not open the safe, Rossi fled the betting shop empty handed and then accidentally fired his antique shotgun.Â 

He then dropped the gun in the street during the raid and took off his balaclava to pick it up - before trying to flee on a bike.

The Ladbrokes is located just 
metres from Holborn underground station and on a busy commercial road next to outlets such as 
Subway and Boots.

When Rossi removed the balaclava, his face was seen by dozens of witnesses and Rossi, of Finsbury Park, north London, was arrested.

Rossi was charged with attempted robbery and weapons offences, and pleaded guilty at Blackfriars Crown Court last Thursday.

This shotgun was discovered at Derek Rossi's home in Finsbury park. The robber used a sawn-off off shotgun hidden in an umbrella for his attempted hold up

Shot gun cartridges and ammunition discovered at Derek Rossi's home. The robber held up a Ladbrokes in Holborn, London. When staff could not open the safe he fled the bookmakers and dropped his gun. To retrieve it, he removed his balaclava in front of dozens of onlookers before trying to flee on a bike. Rossi was arrested soon after

He is due to be sentenced later this month.

Detective Inspector Scott Hartley, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a terrifying attack committed in broad daylight and Rossi gave no thought to his terrified victims and what he put them through.

'They have been left traumatised by the event of having a shotgun pointed at them and they both feared for their lives.

'Rossi showed an utter disregard for the victims and I can only but praise them for coming forward and assisting us with our investigation to ensure that a he is put behind bars.'

We've seen that before: In Guy Ritchie's 2000 film, 'Snatch', two robbers attempt to hold up a betting shop but leave empty handed

Robbers in Guy Ritchie's film 'Snatch' also leave a betting shop they attempt to rob empty handed. They then remove their balaclavas in front of CCTV cameras. Rossi carried out a similar move when he took off his balaclava in front of onlookers outside the betting shop he had held up
