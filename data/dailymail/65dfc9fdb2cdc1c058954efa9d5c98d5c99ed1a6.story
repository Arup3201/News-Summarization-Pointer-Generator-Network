It's a modern-day equivalent of The Good Life – the 1970s hit TV comedy in which middle-class couple Tom and Barbara Good set out to live self-sufficiently from the produce of their suburban garden.

The co-operative of residents living on the Hockerton Housing Project  in Nottinghamshire generate their own energy, grow their own food, rear their own animals and supply their own water.

The difference is that in this 2014 version, the residents enjoy ‘all mod cons’: dishwashers, fridges, freezers, wi-fi, broadband and satellite TV.

Green room: A four-bedroom eco-pad - and a stake in the unique community at the he Hockerton Housing Project in Nottinghamshire - is on sale for £500,000

The project, which comprises five eco-houses, was set up in the late 1990s by Peter Rajan and a group  of friends interested in sustainability.

Now a rare opportunity to join this select community has arisen, because Peter is leaving to build a new eco-home from scratch and is selling  his four-bedroom eco-pad – and  his stake in the unique community – for £500,000.

He is quick to point out that among the benefits, the buyer will no longer have to pay heating bills or water rates.

‘Instead of utilising a central heating system,’ he says, ‘the houses act as a thermal store for radiant heat from the sun, so the conservatories at the front of the building, which are south-facing, heat the fabric  of the building.’

Earth on the roofs helps to seal in the warmth.

‘When it comes to power, the houses utilise photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to provide electricity,’ Peter says.

He adds: ‘Across the whole year we’re net producers of power. The houses actually produce more electricity than they consume.’

The homes are connected to the National Grid, allowing the community to fall back on mains electricity if necessary.

‘We
 have a drinking-water system that takes rainwater from the conservatory
 roofs and treats it,’ Peter adds. He says that the washing- water 
system, which produces a slightly lower quality of water, takes water 
from the land, treats it through sand filters and then feeds it back  to
 the houses.

Peter believes he saves about £1,500 a year on electricity bills and a further £300 a year on water bills.

The
 co-operative is spread across ten acres. There are vegetable plots, a 
greenhouse, an orchard – with apples, pears and plums – and land for 
sheep, chickens and bees. A lake on the site provides fish.

‘The
 experience of living here – waking up in the morning and looking out on
 to a lake with water lilies and fish swimming in it – always raises the
 spirits,’ Peter says. The residents, who meet every week to discuss how
 best to maintain their green existence, are expected to clock up a set 
number of hours working the land.

‘One
 of the differences between this place and an ordinary house is that you
 have more contact with your neighbours,’ Peter adds. ‘The community 
works by virtue of co-operation. You have the opportunity to plan things
 together and achieve things that you wouldn’t normally do.’

Peter will be moving out together with
 his new partner. He says: ‘My family has grown up and moved away so 
it’s come to the time really to think about moving on.

'The house is 
probably larger than I need now and that’s not very sustainable.’

The houses are sold on a leasehold basis. The leases run for 999 years and all began in 1998. The ground rent is £30 per year.

The leases grant rights to all the services required to run the houses – water, electricity, waste-water treatment – and ensure that the leaseholders maintain the land co-operatively between the five households.

The eco-pads have become a magnet for middle-class professionals. An illustrator, a psychologist and an acupuncturist are just some of the people who have left behind conventional households for the eco-retreat.

Company director Robert Cartwright and Citizens Advice Bureau advocate Liz Laine swapped a cramped two-bedroom flat in North London for a house in the community, where they live with their five-year-old son Jack.

They now combine working from home with commuting to London or Birmingham. They have an electric car which they use to buy the commodities not supplied by the project.

‘Before moving to Hockerton we lived just off Camden High Street  in a top-floor flat – pretty noisy but  it was great being in the centre of things,’ Liz says. ‘But we had been to visit here and learned that one of the houses was up for sale. We were very keen to move out of London, and thinking about starting a family.’

She explains how the community shares the workload: ‘We divide up the way that we grow our food so each family will be responsible for a different thing; so we grow the peas and the beans and we also grow peppers and chillies. I’m particularly keen on making more use of our poly-tunnel so that we can grow food for a longer season through the year.’

Rob adds: ‘A lot of people expect composting toilets because it’s an eco-house but it’s just a normal home. We live a normal life, we just reduce our energy bills significantly.

‘There are aspects of living in London that we miss, but I certainly prefer living here.’
