A grieving father took lethal revenge on the ‘pure scum’ he wrongly blamed for his son’s death, an inquest heard yesterday.

Roy Allison stabbed 36-year-old Duncan Bell to death and left a placard by his body declaring: ‘This drug dealer took my son, took our whole lives. I’ve just taken his.’

Mr Allison, who had suffered three months of torment following the drug death of his son, Roy Jr, then hanged himself.

But the inquest heard that  
28-year-old Roy Jr, a cage-fighter, had provided some of the drugs he 
shared with Mr Bell and another friend, Grant Maker, as they celebrated 
his birthday last March.

He died after overdosing on ecstasy, which they
all took.

A coroner said his death was ‘a tragic misadventure’. Although Mr Bell 
provided the ecstasy, no evidence was  produced to suggest that he was a
drug dealer and it is understood a police investigation found none.

The triple tragedy was detailed at three consecutive inquests.

Mr Bell’s mother Diane Bell and Roy Jr’s mother Mary Brunyee, who wears a
locket containing some of her son’s ashes, hugged each other after the 
verdicts were announced.

The court heard 65-year-old Mr Allison smashed Mr Bell’s skull before 
stabbing him in the neck, chest and heart last July.

His chilling 
message was written on an  A4-size card placed near the body.

He left an 11-page letter confessing to the murder, and asked his nephew
Jason to tell police to go to his home in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, 
where they would find Mr Bell’s body.

That evening, he went to 
Peterborough Crematorium, where he had buried his son’s ashes, and where
he had already had his own name inscribed on the headstone they would 
share, and hanged himself from a ladder.

In his letter, Mr Allison accused Mr Bell of being ‘one of the biggest 
drug dealers in this area’ and insisted he caused his son’s death.

Under a heading ‘Pure Scum’ it continued: ‘He will lose his life at my 
hand. The law is the law but justice is another matter... I believe it 
is right for me to rid this scum away from the community.’

Revenge: After he killed Mr Bell, Roy Snr went to Peterborough crematorium and took his own life

Peterborough coroner David Heming heard that in the weeks after Roy Jr’s
death, Mr Bell frequently visited Mr Allison.

Detective Constable John 
Cox, who investigated the deaths, told the inquest: ‘It’s possible that 
Duncan may have mentioned something that took place that evening which 
Roy Sr may have picked up on, and which directed him towards Duncan as 
the person who provided the drugs which ultimately killed his son.’

But Mr Maker told the inquest that Roy Jr had brought cocaine to the 
gathering at Mr Allison’s house.

Mr Bell had produced a gram of MDMA, a 
highly concentrated form of ecstasy but ‘not an excessive amount’. Roy 
Jr was ‘fully aware of what he was taking’, he said.

Roy 
Jnr’s friend Grant Maker, who was with him on the fatal night, told the 
court from the witness box Roy himself had brought cocaine to the 
gathering at the house he shared with his father.

All three had drunk strong lager and rum while taking the 
drugs and ‘having a good time’.

'Nobody
forced anyone to do anything,' he said. They were all grown men and had
all taken equal amounts of the drugs. It was 'not like a kiddy peer 
pressure thing,' he said.

'It was a really nice evening. Not one bad thing.'

Neither he nor Duncan had any concerns about Roy’s condition before they left in the early hours.

Roy had sent a text to Grant saying he was sorry he couldn’t stay. 'Wish you didn’t go, bro,' it said, adding: 'Not done yet.'

Next day, the super-fit martial arts instructor was found dead in his room.

Neither he nor Mr Bell had any concerns about Roy Jr but next day the 
martial arts instructor was found dead in his room.

A post mortem 
examination found alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and ‘a potentially fatal 
amount of MDMA’ in his body.

As well as the misadventure verdict on Roy Jr, Mr Heming recorded that 
Mr Bell was unlawfully killed and that Mr Allison killed himself after 
being ‘consumed by grief’.

Outside court, Mrs Bell said she forgave Mr Allison and believed he 
killed her son because he was ‘out of his mind’.

Of her son, she added: 
‘He was not a drug dealer. I’m glad the truth has finally come out.’
