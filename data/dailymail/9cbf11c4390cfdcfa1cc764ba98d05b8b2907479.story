Gary Lineker has discovered his great, great grandfather, James Pratt, was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children

He became known as one of England's top goal poachers on the pitch but it seems pinching things is in Gary Lineker's genes.

The Match of the Day presenter has discovered his great, great, great grandfather, James Pratt, was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children.

James served his time in jail in Leicester which included six months for stealing chickens.

The football legend made the discovery while filming BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are?

According to The Sunday People, the father-of-four said 'Most of us would do anything for our children to keep them well, to keep them fed. He had no choice. He must have been desperate. You can understand that.'

Lineker, who played for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona and Spurs, returned to his old stomping ground of Leicester in January to film scenes for the history show.

He joins a long list of celebrities who have taken part in the programme which traces their family trees to discover surprises from their past.

Nigel Havers, broadcaster John Simpson, The Apprentice’s Nick Hewer, singer Marianne Faithfull, actresses Una Stubbs, Minnie Driver and Lesley Sharp, and EastEnders star Nitin Ganatra – agreed to open up their lives for the cameras for this series, and the surprising revelations come thick and fast.

Nigel Havers talks of how even he assumed that he was super-posh and came from an eminently connected family.

While his father was a barrister and MP who served under Margaret Thatcher, his grandfather was a judge and a rather notorious one.

He earned his place in the history books for being the last British judge to sentence a woman to  be hanged, having presided over the trial of Ruth Ellis.

Lineker will appear on the show on August 21.
