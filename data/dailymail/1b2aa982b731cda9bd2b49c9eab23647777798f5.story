ASOS is launching its first ever erotic accessories range, which includes multi-use collars, cuffs, headbands, tassels
 and blindfolds.

The diffusion line from luxe label Holloway Smith Noir is aimed at 18-25-year-olds.

The Gigi Noir range is priced from £33-£57 and all items come in both gold or black, all made from sequins, recycled leather and Swarovski crystals.

Playful and fun erotic accessories label, Gigi Noir, launches on ASOS this month - aimed at 18-25-year-olds

In conjunction with the launch of the brand new 
Gigi Noir range and deal with ASOS, the firm's founders launch a 
campaign for better sex education and better sex called, ahem, 
Ladies Come First.

Stocking the accessible range from the makers of the most luxurious (and expensive, £265) nipple tassels in the world is a bold move for ASOS,
 and a completely new category for them.

And sister CEOs Sophie and Alice Holloway - the so-called Mistresses of Teasewear - say what really won the online 
retailer over was their passionate, positive message about sex and 
sex education.

'Playfulness and fun are the key messages
 behind the collection,' says Sophie. 'The
 luxury erotic industry is geared towards an older more mature audience 
who are at a different stage in their economic lifetime,' says Sophie.

'We
 believe young adults also deserve access to high quality teasewear and
 this belief has lead to our collaboration with ASOS.'

Gigi Noir's sexual responsibility campaign, Ladies Come First, hopes to help young men and women explore sexual issues such as consent, pleasure, confidence and communication.

'This 
campaign gives us the opportunity to get some basic principles laid down
 right at the beginning of young people's sexual journeys,' says Sophie.

'We
 don't believe all porn is bad but it's certainly not how you should be 
learning about sex. Ignoring problems won't make them go away, you have 
to be the antidote.

'Ladies Come First is going to empower people to have better sex, and who doesn't want better sex?'

The company wants to give out a pocket book guide to female orgasm at university freshers weeks

Ladies Come First is a social sexual responsibility communication campaign and hub of pleasure-based sex education and information - 'a place to start such conversations'.

The sisters have been selling their products at cabaret shows every weekend for the last three years and what they've been hearing from their customers is that while they love the idea of sex accessories, they're not getting enough out of the act as they'd like.

As just 30
 per cent of women are orgasming during sex, Sophie is adamant that is 
not a  physiological problem but a societal one.

'We
 were hearing from a breadth of women that they were interested in 
building anticipation and gaining more pleasure from sex,' says Sophie.

The campaign starts now via their website, www.ladiescomefirst.co.uk, and social media accounts.

They are planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign for £10,000 on Inidegogo for their Guide To The Female Orgasm.

The sisters want to give out the pocket book at university freshers' weeks and are in talks with three British institutions for starters; Royal Holloway, Birmingham and Cambridge.

'Sex education at the moment is not 
aware of the fact that young people are growing up with exposure to the 
internet and hardcore pornography, and this has to be addressed,' says 
Sophie.

This collar necklace comes in black and gold, like all the products, and features a playful tassel

The sisters felt like there wasn't anyone marketing erotic accessories to a younger audience

These cuffs can be used as restraints and bed post ties

'We want to rebrand what young and sexy is, and move away from this porn star thing - that going from your day life to your sex life should require a transformation into this object.

'Young women need the confidence to 
know their bodies and know how to express that to their partner.

'We felt like there wasn't anyone marketing erotic accessories to a younger audience, and that there is this blank period in between being able to afford Agent Provocateur and being comfortable in your sexual preferences - so we created this range that has a good price point and a fashion-forward aesthetic.'

All Holloway Smith Noir and Gigi Noir products are handmade in the sister's Holborn studio.

Gigi Noir and Holloway Smith Noir is also available to purchase online at hollowaysmithnoir.com and Coco de Mer among others.
