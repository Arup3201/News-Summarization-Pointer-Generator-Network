Trouble: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing extremely tough times ahead

Spain today officially entered into a double-dip recession - with experts warning that EU-ordered public sector spending cuts will plunge the eurozone's fourth largest economy into further turmoil.

Economists also said the cuts, combined with troubles in the banking sector, would delay any return to growth until late this year or beyond after the nation sank into recession for the first quarter.

It is the second recession in just over two years and comes as the government tries to convince investors it will not need outside aid to pay its bills like other countries caught up in the debt crisis.   

The country is now facing intense pressure from its European peers to fix public finances, and growing domestic resistance to austerity measures that have helped push unemployment to more than double the EU average.           

Ratings agency Standard & Poor's added to the country's problems with a two-notch rating downgrade last week and today chopped the credit score of eleven banks.        

While the 0.3 per cent contraction from January to March from the previous quarter was slightly better than the forecast drop of 0.4 per cent, it confirmed the economy is in a tough spot.      

'The wheels are very clearly coming off the economy,' Jefferies economist David Owen said.               

'It wouldn't surprise me to see a very significant decline in GDP both in the second and third quarters this year, and it's still reasonably easy to envisage GDP to be down about 1.5 per cent this year.'

Spain was last in recession, defined by two straight quarters of economic contraction, at the end of 2009. On an annual basis, the economy contracted by 0.4 per cent, compared with growth of 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter, today's official data showed.              

Riots: Spaniards have been taking to the streets to protest against public sector cuts they deem to be unfair and unjustified

The government's latest economic plan, published on Friday before it was sent to the European Commission for approval, forecast a contraction of 1.7 per cent in 2012 turning to 0.2 per cent growth by next year.       

Spanish bonds showed little reaction to the report but yields have risen to around 6 per cent in recent weeks as investors digest the country's worsening economic news.

Yields of around 7 per cent are seen as financially unsustainable and have led to Portugal, Ireland and Greece seeking bailouts from the EU.          

European markets have remained relatively stable today, despite the news. The FTSE-100 is 0.20 per cent down at 5,737.10; France's CAC 40 is 1.18 per cent down at 3,227.75; and Germany's DAX is 0.28 per cent down at 6,782.20.

The S&P downgrades of both the financial institutions and the sovereign put the country's fragile banking system back into the spotlight, while massive unemployment will remain a drag on already tight public accounts.  

The banks were damaged by the real estate collapse that began in 2008 and now bad loans in other sectors of the economy have risen sharply.                     

Pain in Spain: The nation's banks have virtually no access to the wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap European Central Bank debt

They have virtually no access to the 
wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap 
European Central Bank debt and have bought domestic debt, helping the 
Treasury to fulfil half of its gross issuance already this year.      

ECB data today showed that Spanish and Italian banks filled their coffers with government bonds last month, confirming that they had helped keep a lid on yields.

But non-residents, which before December held an average of around 50 per cent of Spain's debt, held just 37.5 per cent in March, the Treasury said.        

The country's two largest banks Santander and BBVA have suggested they may not buy any more government debt this year, adding to fears the Treasury may have to pay higher costs to place new debt.       

Some investors have been betting the ECB will restart its programme of buying bonds of troubled euro zone states to help Spain out but some central bank policymakers are fiercely opposed to the idea.                       

As well as facing pressure from Europe to cut its deficit, there is resistance in Spain for the austerity measures needed to achieve this.

Thousands of Spaniards took part in protests yesterday after data showed unemployment at nearly 25 per cent in the first quarter.             

This tallies with a wave of revolt around Europe to the austerity measures that have been prescribed by policymakers from European institutions and from fiscally conservative countries such as Germany.      

Economists, including some from the International Monetary Fund, have started to question whether it is right to push austerity at the expense of restarting growth.            

Owen added: 'I assume we get some policy response out of the ECB and Spain is allowed to rein back on its fiscal austerity it is pushing through.

'There's certainly a lot of push back as people question the German-centric view of the world that everyone needs more austerity.'

The Spanish government has announced savings of over €40billion this year from both central and regional government budgets, to try and cut the deficit to 5.3 per cent of GDP this year from 8.5 per cent of GDP in 2011.   

The conservative government, which took power from the Socialists in December, has introduced a labour reform and a banking sector reform which forces the banks to raise over €52billion in capital this year.   

However, with property prices expected by some to fall another 20-30 per cent, many economists believe increased banking provisions against potential bad real estate loans will not be enough to stabilise the sector.   

Some economists say the country will eventually need a financial bailout package like Greece and Ireland but the government has repeatedly said it will not seek outside help.
