President Barack Obama says he has a plan to boost jobs and relieve the long-term unemployed while cutting taxes - and he'll reveal it when he gets back from his vacation.

A White House official said Mr Obama's proposals would be fresh ones, not a 
rehash of plans he has pitched for weeks and still supports, like 
his idea of an ‘infrastructure bank’ to fund construction jobs.

However, the American people won't hear details of the proposals, or any other
solutions to the nation's economic woes, until Obama returns from his 
summer sojourn in Martha's Vineyard, the wealthy island enclave off Massachusetts, where his family will vacation for the third 
straight year.

Got a plan? As he ends his three-day campaign bus tour, President Obama says he has a plan for the economy and stalled job numbers as he gets set for a vacation to Martha's Vineyard

Mr Obama's version will challenge the new 'supercommittee' of Congress to go beyond its goal of $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction.

Confirming the deficit-reduction part of his plan directly, Obama told a rural town hall crowd in Illinois on Wednesday: 'I don't think it's good enough for us to just do it part way. If we're going to do it, let's go ahead and fix it.'

Obama's major economic speech will come right after the Sept. 5 Labor Day holiday. Republicans were underwhelmed.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said via Twitter that Obama could scrap the speech and just hand over a detailed plan to Congress.

'Seriously, just drop it in the mail. Podium not required,’ Mr Buck's tweet said.

Mr Obama will seek to use his economic proposals as leverage against Republicans in Congress, hoping to show a nation disgusted with gridlock that he is the one trying to get results.

Obama's re-election campaign and the White House are also sure to use any specific ideas from the president as a way to blunt attacks from the Republicans hoping to run against him in next year's presidential election.

Already, Obama has been previewing his line of attack.

In Illinois on Wednesday, Obama is likely to touch on his economic plans during the final leg of a campaign-themed Midwest bus tour.

Republican White House contender Mitt Romney, campaigning in New Hampshire, needled Obama for showing up with too little and too late on the economy.

Taking jabs: Republican presidential candidates like Mitt Romney are using the opportunity to take some digs at the president for going on vacation at such a crucial time.

'But we appreciate the fact that he's going to devote some time to it,' Romney said. 'Not just going to be on the bus tour, not just going to be vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, but giving some thought to the American people.'

Obama is due to leave Washington Thursday for the 10-day trip at the $50,000-a-week Blue Heron Farm, but he’s not the only one taking a break this summer.

Most lawmakers left town in early August, right after reaching a deal with the White House to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a potentially catastrophic government default.

Congress isn't expected to get back to work until early September.

Former President George W. Bush was heavily criticized after spending nearly 500 days at his Crawford ranch within his two terms

With the lawmakers away, there's probably not much Obama could get done on the economic front even if he did cancel his trip. And even if Congress stayed in Washington, too, there are no quick fixes for the country's deep economic problems.

Rich Galen, a GOP consultant, said both Obama and Congress 'don't have anything to act upon.'

He added: 'If anyone knew what the answer to this was, they'd do it.'

Then there's the issue of perception. Obama will be vacationing at a rented multi-million dollar estate on an island known as a haven for the rich and famous at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and countless more are financially strapped.

Bill Clinton's aides were so concerned about vacation perceptions that they polled the public before deciding where he should go.

While Clinton preferred trips to Martha's Vineyard, polling sometimes pushed him toward places like the more rugged Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Former President George W. Bush was criticized for spending nearly 500 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, during his two terms in office.

He was there in August 2001 when he received a CIA briefing paper warning him of al Qaeda's intentions to strike the U.S. — just over a month before the Sept. 11 attacks.

And in 2005, he remained on vacation after Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans and devastated the Gulf Coast. His presidency suffered from his response to the storm and his decision to not immediately return to Washington.

That's a wrap: President Obama leaves for Martha's Vineyard tomorrow after a three-day economic bus tour also seen as a campaign-themed

Some of Obama's prior vacations have come under fire as well. Last summer, he was chided for not taking his family on a Gulf Coast vacation following the BP PLC oil spill.

When he finally did travel to the Florida Panhandle for a weekend, his attempts to soothe public concern about the safety of the region's beaches were tainted when the White House released a photo of the president and daughter Sasha swimming in water that turned out not to be the Gulf.

'Fired' up: Donald Trump has taken a swipe at President Obama, saying the president takes vacation's 'constantly' and now's not the right time

Perhaps mindful of the president's image, the White House booked Obama on a three-day, economy-focused bus tour through the Midwest right before the start of his vacation.

He also travelled to Michigan last week to speak at a factory that makes batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles.

On Tuesday, real estate mogul Donald Trump led the attack on the president over his escapes.

'We have a president that's constantly - whether it's Martha's Vineyard or someplace else - constantly on vacation. I mean, all the time he's on vacation!

'So I think it sends a very, very bad message. We have to work in this country to bring it back.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney said he doesn't think the public begrudges the president a break to recharge and spend time with his family.

Besides, Carney said, the president is never really off-duty, since White House advisers go with him and he still receives regular briefings on national security and the economy.

'The presidency travels with you. He will be in constant communication,' said Carney, also noting that Martha's Vineyard is close enough to Washington that Obama could make it home quickly if needed.

Short of an unexpected crisis, Obama seems determined to follow through with his Martha's Vineyard plans.

And he has adamantly rejected the notion of calling Congress back from its break.

'The last thing we need is Congress spending more time arguing in D.C.," he said during a speech in Michigan last week.

'What I figure is, they need to spend more time out here listening to you and hearing how fed up you are.'

The big bus: President Obama boards the huge black coach that has drawn fire for its imposing appearance, as well as the revelation that the vehicle was made in Canada

Meanwhile, the president's plans to kickstart the economy have been overshadowed by the hulking, $1.1million bus he is using to tour the country on his three-day Midwest tour - and it was made in Canada.

Model: VIP H3-45 made by the Quebec-based coach company Prevost

Cost: $1.1m

Security features: Armoured doors plus a device dubbed the 'football' that allows the President to remotely control US nuclear weapons.

Communications: Satellite equipment allows Obama to communicate and teleconference worldwide.

Additional features: Slide out panels to increase floorspace,  flat-screen TV, couches.

Economy: 6.7 mpg

Other owners:  Kid Rock, David Lee Roth and Kenny Rogers

The big black coach has already drawn fire for its imposing appearance - it has been likened to Darth Vadar's helmet, a police mortuary truck, and called the Battle Bus from Mordor - and the revelation the vehicle was made by Quebec-based company Prevost will dent Mr Obama's chances of reviving his flailing polls.

Dubbed 'Greyhound One', the fearsome looking machine stands in stark contrast to the usual campaign trail buses, cheerfully emblazoned with slogans and decked in the Stars and Stripes.

Website Gawker came up with the Star Wars-themed suggestion as the President entered day two of his Midwest tour on the new $1.1million bus purchased by the Secret Service.

The BBC's Mark Mardell added that the formidable looking machine was, 'big, blocky, black, with painted-out windows.'

'It looks more like a police mortuary van than a symbol of hope arriving on your street.'

The impenetrable-looking conveyance is the size of a cross-country Greyhound, painted all in black, with dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan emphasised that the bus wasn't purchased solely for the President and would be used for other dignitaries in the future.
