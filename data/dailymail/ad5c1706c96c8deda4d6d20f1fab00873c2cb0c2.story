British people are frequently accused of being reserved, dignified and possessing a stiff upper lip. But according to a new survey, that stereotype is a thing of the past.

Instead of keeping private lives tucked away behind closed doors, Brits now share a staggering 67 million pictures, videos and snippets of information every week.

And those who regularly update their Facebook status or Twitter feed can be slotted into one of five groups: the Big Softies, the Chatterboxes, the Gizmo Grumpies, the Mobile Butterflies and the iSavers.

Irksome: Do you follow Peaches Geldof? If so, you'll have seen plenty of pics, all of baby son Astala, like this

Pets: Like Leona Lewis, pictured with her dog Lily, 'Big Softies like posting photos of their animal companions

'The study not only gives us new 
insight into the motivations behind the different groups sharing content
online, it also paints a touching picture that as a nation, Brits love 
to spread happiness by sharing the silly stuff,' said psychologist Susan Quilliam who analysed the results.

'It has become the modern version of the mix tape or 
postcard, a way of showing those we’re close to that we care and we’re thinking 
of them.'

The research, commissioned by mobile phone network Three found that almost half of all British users were so-called 'Big Softies' who use social media to stay in touch with family and friends.

Innocuous though most of their posts are, Big Softies do have some annoying habits.These are the users who clog up your Twitter feed with baby photos and inane comments about their pets.

The next, and possibly most irritating, group are the Chatterboxes. They are the ones who Instagram every meal, tweet about Kim Kardashian's every movement and, worst of all, indulge in 'humble bragging'.

For those yet to come across a humble bragger, these users post thinly disguised boasts which are all the more irksome for the attempt at concealment.

While the worst offenders are usually celebrities - step forward Oprah Winfrey and reality star Tila Tequila - the trend is filtering through into everyday use.

Typical examples include 'Got told I look like Jessica Alba today #iamsoconfused' and 'Just gave £100 to the homeless man outside the station. Irrational kindness is so cool.'

Humble brag alert! If you didn't know that One Direction star, Louis Tomlinson, can play guitar, you do now!

But it's not all bad news for Chatterboxes. According to Quilliam, those who fit into this group love life and are always ready for a good time.

The next group, the private and self-contained Gizmo Grumpies, are the opposite of Chatterboxes, regularly retweeting bad news and 'pre-made content' (slogans, ads and so on) that don't tell you much about them.

Though their newsfeed looks miserable, Gizmo Grumpies aren't quite the misanthropes they'd have you believe, with 12 per cent of British social media users saying they do it to take their mind off their worries.

Like the Chatterboxes, the Mobile Butterflies just can't keep away from social media, with 42 per cent sharing five or more items each week.

23 per cent of the UK population, mostly students, fit into this category but despite their prolific output, aren't anywhere near as irksome as the Chatterboxes, thanks to the entertaining content of their tweets.

Think cool new bloggers or funny pony videos - 78 per cent of those in this group said they regularly share entertaining animal videos.

Self portraits are also a big part of the average Mobile Butterfly's feed, as model Mobile Butterflies Cara Delevingne and Rihanna could tell you.

Lastly, there's the iSavers, who make up more than a third of social media users. This group like nothing more than a great online deal, which they're all too happy to share on Facebook - 46 per cent of this group say they do so regularly.

Sharing isn’t necessarily caring though. The iSaver is a savvy sharer and forwards a third of these promotions because doing so provides additional discounts.

Olly Topley, Head of Insights at Three commented: 'What is fascinating about this research is the degree of sharing and the different motivations people have for doing it.

'From practical advice and saving to pure self expression, what is really interesting is the notion that sharing is not always about you, but how you make the recipient feel.'
