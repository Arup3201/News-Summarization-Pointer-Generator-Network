Footage has emerged of the moment locals made contact with a remote Amazonian tribe forced from their homes by drug traffickers and illegal logging.

Campaigners believe the indigenous people on the Envira river, on Brazil's border with Peru, had their homes burned down and were shot at by Peruvian cocaine gangsters.

They walked several days through the Amazon rainforest, before telling a translator in Brazil's Acre region their relatives had died and vultures had picked at the bodies they were unable to bury.

First contact: This is the moment loincloth-clad natives of the Envira river region, on the border between Brazil and Peru in the Amazon rainforest, took an offering of bananas from locals living along the river's banks

Chase: The footage released by the Brazilian authorities showed locals wading out into the muddy river to deliver the bananas. They also took weapons and tools after their homes were reportedly burned down

The five young men and two young women, who were wearing loincloths and carrying bows and arrows, are believed to be part of a group of at least 50 natives isolated from the outside world.

They first made contact on June 29 with the Ashaninka local people of northern Brazil, and spoke using the Panoan group of languages unique to the Brazil-Peru border.

The Brazilian government's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) intervened to protect the tribe, and released a video of the tribespeople accepting an offering of bananas.

The video shows them shouting to locals across the wide, muddy river before taking axes and blades and returning to their homes.

In one part of the footage, a tribesman is shown operating a rifle - though it is not known if the guns  returned with them to the village.

Worrying change: Part of the footage showed one of the tribesmen handling a rifle after taking supplies from locals living along the riverbank. It is unclear whether the weapon was taken with him back to the village

Health danger: The natives, who were carrying bows and arrows, had to be treated for flu but survived

It is thought they came in search of basic tools and weaponry, but during their contact some of the tribespeople contracted the flu - which is often fatal for their immune systems.

They were treated at an 'ethnoenvironmental protection base' in the Xinane indigenous region, which is protected for natives under Brazilian law.

Anthropologist Terri Aquino told Brazilian news site G1: 'These people are in search of technology. This is important to their lives, because there is an internal "war" between them and the contact with other non-indigenous groups.' 

The government said they have now returned to their villages - but campaigners said they were still under threat. 

Fiona Watson, the research director at tribal rights group Survival International, said there were up to 600 uncontacted natives in the region whose lives were threatened by development.

'The latest situation is really serious and deeply worrying,' she told MailOnline.

Offering: The video began with one of the local residents wading out into the river near the border with Peru

Approach: After a moment of debate in a language native to the border, the locals accepted the fresh fruit

'What we think has happened, from piecing things together from what the uncontacted Indians have said to the interpreter, is they fled after their homes were set fire to and their relatives were shot at by white people in Peru. 

'It tallies with information we have from Peru that drug traffickers are planting coca plants, making cocaine and trafficking it.

'Illegal logging is also happening in Peru and we believe this is pushing the people out. It is dismaying. 

'All indigenous people have a very strong notion of territory. They've had their land invaded and been attacked. They mimicked firearms being shot at them and one talked about burying people.

'Others they couldn't bury and they said vultures ate the corpses.'

She added: 'There are places that until 20 or 30 years ago were very remote, like the Amazon rainforest.

Accepted: The five young men and two young women were dressed only in loincloths and live traditionally

Scenic: The Acre region of Brazil is home to around 600 uncontacted indigenous people, campaigners believe

'Parts of it are still remote, but loggers, miners and settlers are pushing deeper into the rainforest and governments want to open it up for gas, oil and hydroelectric dams.

'That means more infrastructure is being built and the frontier is being brought down.

'Indigenous peoples are the vanguard in the protection of rainforests. There are hunter gatherers but there are also people who grow plants or fish in the rivers.'

The group is running a petition calling for better resources to protect indigenous peoples' way of life. 

A spokesman for Brazil's National Indian Foundation said: 'In dialogues with indigenous group through interpreters, they reported that they suffered acts of violence committed by non-Indians in the headwaters of the river Envira, located in Peruvian territory

'As this is the region of Brazil-Peru border and on these reports, measures that seek to ascertain the facts reported and implement an action plan under the Technical Cooperation Agreement signed between Funai and the Peruvian government in March this are being taken year, in order to protect isolated indigenous peoples and the territorial border monitoring in the region.'
