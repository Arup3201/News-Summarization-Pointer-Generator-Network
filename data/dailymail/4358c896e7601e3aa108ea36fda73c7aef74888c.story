They call him the Iron Tulip, and Louis van Gaal chose a floral reference to describe his first, precarious foray into the third round of the FA Cup at Yeovil.

The Manchester United manager has already fallen foul of a League One club in the humiliating 4-0 defeat at MK Dons that dumped his side out of the Capital One Cup in August.

Van Gaal knows what to expect and was quick to point out he has come unstuck in cup competitions before; notably a 3-2 Spanish Cup defeat by third-tier Novelda in 2002 when he was in charge of Barcelona, and Ajax’s exit from the Dutch Cup at the hands of Cambuur in 1996.

Louis van Gaal's Manchester United lost 4-0 against MK Dons back in August

The Dutchman was not happy with his side's display against MK Dons back in August

He said: ‘In the Netherlands we have a saying ‘Death or the gladioli’, which means all or nothing. You are dead or you receive the gladiolus flower, and in cup matches it’s always like that. You can win and you can lose.

‘It’s a gladioli game, and it’s not only like that in England. The criticism in Spain was very high and also in the Netherlands.

‘We have been drawn against Yeovil away from home and we know from our early exit in the Capital One Cup that league places mean nothing in the cups.’
