Spanish newspaper Marca has torn into the national side following their 5-1 defeat to Holland, running a predominantly black front page with the blunt headline: ‘FIX THIS’.

The paper also highlights the role Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie played in Holland’s brilliant dismantling of the reigning world and European champions, as future Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal’s side struck four times after the break.

But below the picture of Iker Casillas looking distraught, the paper does offer some hope, saying: 'Chile and Australia, two games to demonstrate the talent and football that made us champions. Believe.'

It also mentioned how Spain conceded more
 goals in the match against Holland than they did in the whole of their 
successful 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 campaigns.

Marca say Casillas had a night to forget as Holland ‘dominated’ Spain in Salvador.

AS report that Van Persie and Robben 'destroyed' the Spanish defence, el Periodico's headline reads 'red with shame' and Mundo Deportivo runs with 'Friday 13' with a picture of a forlorn Casillas.

Spain coach Vicente del Bosque admitted to feeling physically sick by the nature of the defeat.

Switzerland upset the eventual winners in the opening game four years ago but the manner of this humbling could be harder to bounce back from.

‘I feel sick, ill at ease, but with the courage a defeat must not sink us,’ he said.

‘It is not a happy moment, but first of all I want to congratulate the Dutch team, who were superior to us. We have been overwhelmed in the second half.

‘We are a team of good professionals and good lads, everyone hurts, so there was no accusatory glances and that's good for the team. There will be time to talk.’

The veteran coach also declined to zero in on the performance of Casillas, who was to blame for two of Holland's goals in a shaky performance.

Asked directly about his goalkeeper's display, Del Bosque said: ‘I insist that it is not the time to blame. The defeats do not come through the performance of a player, but by the weakness of the team. We cannot blame anyone, least of all Iker.’

Spain’s next group game is against Chile on Wednesday.
