Witnesses have told how a Utah 
man who was allegedly attempting to cover up the murder of his wife 
kissed her head, rubbed her feet and wondered aloud why she 
would shave her legs when she was planning to kill herself as she lay dying.

During the first day 
of a preliminary hearing for Conrad Truman, 31 - an Orem man charged 
with murdering his wife Heidy in September 2012 in order to claim her 
life insurance policy - a court heard how Truman came up with 
multiple explanations and narratives regarding the death of his spouse 
as part of a botched cover-up.

Truman
 has been charged with first-degree murder and obstruction of justice, 
with prosecutors alleging he murdered his 26-year-old wife so as to 
receive more than $878,000 from her death.

Police say Conrad Truman, 31, killed his 25-year-old wife Heidy on September 31, 2012, at their home in Orem, Utah, and then told several inconsistent stories about what had happened to her

Orem
 Police Cpl. William Crook was on patrol the night of Sept. 30, 2012, 
and was dispatched to 220 S. 1180 West on reports of a shootin, according to KSL Utah.

He said he arrived at the home to find
 Conrad Truman in the doorway, screaming for help, with blood on his 
hands and some of his clothes.

He
 followed Truman up a set of stairs to the kitchen and saw a woman 
laying face down, bleeding due to an apparent gunshot wound.Â 

'It was clear (the blood) was coming from her head,' he said.

In a 911 call played in court, Truman was sobbing and hysterical, yelling incoherently. Crook described Truman as 'irate and agitated' when they arrived.

'He was yelling,' Crook said. 'He was yelling to save her, he was yelling at her to stay alive, that sort of thing.'

Tragic: Police say Conrad Truman pressed a pistol against his wife Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in their suburban Utah home. She was 26

Paramedics arrived and police told Truman to step aside so they could treat Heidy Truman.

'He immediately just became irate, disorderly, threatening, just totally out of the norm,' Crook testified.

'He threatened to kill me and everybody I know if I didn't save Heidy.'

Crook said Truman told him he and his wife had been drinking and got into an argument.

Truman said his wife had gone to take a shower and that he had tried to go in, but was sent away.

He told Crook that he then heard a pop.

'At
 one point, he did say that he thought a bullet must have come through 
the wall, through the sheet rock on the outside,' Crook said.

Truman was arrested during a traffic stop in July after police received a warrant for his arrest following an extensive investigation

Heidy had life insurance policies totaling more than $878,000 at the time of her death - with all of the money payable to her husband

Truman said his wife wasn't suicidal 
or depressed but couldn't offer a clear timeline or explanation of what 
had happened before she was shot.

'Everything he said was just random and out of order - it made no sense,' Crook told the court.

Two
 guns were found inside the home, including one that Truman yelled at 
'like he was mad at the gun' and another that police spotted underneath a
 chair Truman was sitting in.

Police began to suspect that the woman's death was not a suicide.

'After
 seeing his demeanor, after seeing the second gun, the way things were 
playing out, it seemed to me that it was going to be a crime scene,' the
 corporal said.

Orem Fire 
Battalion Chief Russ Sneddon said Truman interfered with the care being 
provided to his wife, 'plus the statements he was making was disturbing 
and of a threatening nature'.

Sneddon said Truman was the first and only person to threaten to kill him in his 17 years as a paramedic.

He said Heidy Truman was still breathing, though it was 'labored' when paramedics arrived around 11 p.m.

Dr.
 Edward Leis, Utah's chief deputy medical examiner, said Heidy Truman's 
time of death was just after 12:30 a.m. on Oct. 1, 2012.

Leis said he determined Heidy Truman was killed due to a gunshot wound to the head and that the manner of death was homicide.

The physical evidence alone could have pointed to either a murder or a suicide, but not an accident, Leis said.

The gun was apparently fired at a close range.

'The physical findings of the wound were consistent with the (gun) barrel being pressed up to the skin's surface,' Leis said.

According to charging documents, Truman told his brother-in-law that a black man had entered the house, and he had seen the man run out just before his wife was shot

A toxicology report showed a blood alcohol level of 0.07, but no drugs in Heidy Truman's system.

Orem Police Sgt. Orlando Ruiz said he went to the hospital to interview Conrad Truman and that he asked the man what happened.

Truman said the couple had watched TV that night and had disagreements about various things, but no real arguments.

But
 Ruiz said Truman also proclaimed that if someone killed his wife, he 
would kill them and that he couldn't understand if it was a suicide.

At one point, Truman also said he wanted to shoot himself.

Heidy Truman's mother, Janet Wagner, testified that her daughter was never suicidal, never even had suicidal thoughts.

She said Heidy Truman had just bought a new, expensive car and that they had planned a trip for their birthdays.

Renee
 Flitton, a victim's advocate in the Orem Department of Public Safety, 
said Truman told her that his wife had been murdered.

He said he had heard someone yelling outside his home prior to the gunshot, and saw a man wandering around and talking to himself.

She said Truman had been jittery when she met him at the couple's home, but she got him calm enough to go to the hospital.

When they were walking in, she said Truman took her by the arm and said they needed to 'find the killer that shot my wife'.

Flitton testified that she was there in the hospital when Truman Conrad hugged his wife's body, told her he loved her and apologized for not protecting her.

But minutes later, he asked why his wife would shave her legs before killing herself.

According to charging documents, Truman told his brother-in-law that a black man had entered the house, and he had seen the man run out just before his wife was shot.

Later, Truman allegedly said the shooting was accidental and provided several theories of suicide.

'The inaccuracies of Conrad's multiple stories, the claims of Heidy being murdered, and Conrad seeing a black male run out of his home are blatant examples of Conrad's dishonesty,' the charges state.

Truman was charged almost nine months after his wife's death.

Police and prosecutors have said money was Truman's 'primary motive' in killing his wife.

Several life insurance policies had been taken out for Heidy Truman, and, combined with other benefits, he stood to receive $878,767 in the case of his wife's death, despite her $43,000 annual salary, the charges state.

But Truman's family has said the couple were not only happy, but financially secure.

At the end of the hearing, which will continue on Dec. 12, Judge Samuel McVey will determine whether there is enough evidence against Truman to order him to stand trial.
