These vibrant comic book covers appear to be the epitome of science fiction, but within their eye-catching illustrations are scarily accurate predictions of life in the 21st century.

The retro covers imagine a world where plastic surgery is common place, man walks on the moon and patients are fitted with artificial hearts.

And although these subjects may not seem that groundbreaking today, all of the covers were published more than 80 years ago between 1929 and 1939.

On the left is a 1939 cover depicting a  fountain of youth which rejuvenates the human body in a beauty parlour of the future. The left image of World without Women depicts a robot saving humanity from extinction. It was published in 1939

For instance, the now infamous moon landing of 1969 was predicted 40 years earlier in the Moon Strollers comic of 1929.

That same year, illustrators predicted that in the future scientists would develop machines that read the subconscious mind and project its thoughts as images, titled Into the Subconscious.

A number of breakthroughs in this field were made just last week.

A student from the University of Washington, fitted with an EEG cap, successfully controlled the hand of a friend sitting half a mile away.

The two students played a game in which cannons had to be fired on-screen. The ‘sender’ thought about firing the cannon, which then moved the hand of the ‘receiver’. 

Yesterday, Google-owned Boston Dynamics unveiled its latest version of the Atlas robots, and the tech giant is developing software that acts like a human.These areas of research will pave the way for the Robot A.1, featured on a comic book cover in 1939, which shows a giant robot controlled by a human brain (left).

Meanwhile, the '#scanners' project allows users to manipulate a digital art installation using a headset that creates a visual record of a person's subconscious mind.

An animator in Manchester said it will give people a glimpse into a dream world, and it uses a £100 ($150) headset developed by technology company NeuroSky. 

The collection - from titles including Marvel, Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories - also includes a host of recognisable scenes including one cover, created in 1939, called World Without Death.

On the left is Secret of the Buried City, a 1939 comic about how the Earth is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation. The right image of 4-sided triangle, also from 1939, shows a scientist cloning the body of a young woman in his laboratory

Deja vu, unexplained shivers down the spine, hairs on the back of your neck...people have always believed the body has many ways of telling you something that is about to happen.

But a recent scientific research paper claims to have discovered that your body can predict the future. 

Scientists said that during tests they found proof people can anticipate events, or realise something is about to happen, without cues.

The paper, in the Frontiers of Perception Science journal, claimed that after studying people's reactions in different tests, they found that subjects could 'predict' that something out of the ordinary was about to happen.

But some scientists said the findings showed scientists were looking for evidence of 'presentiment' and didn't actually prove that it existed.

In the image, a doctor is seen fitting a patient with an artificial heart - reminiscent of Matthew Green, who become the first Britain discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart in 2011.

These areas of research will pave the way for the Robot A.1, featured on a comic book cover in 1939, which shows a giant robot controlled by a human brain.

During this year’s World Cup, for example, a paraplegic used a mind-controlled exoskeleton to walk on the pitch and kick the first ball of the tournament.

And last month, scientists revealed two patients fitted with radical new mind-controlled artificial limbs that link directly with their skeleton and nervous system.

While many of the covers appear to be a fairly accurate prediction of the future, others are thankfully yet to come to fruition.

One comic, dubbed Cities in the Air, sees New York become an airborne city, elevated above the Earth’s surface to avoid pollutants and Secret of the Buried City, in which Earth is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation.

Another retro cover of Kidnapped into the Future shows a man from the year 4230 travelling by time machine back to mid-20th century America. 

Scientists may not have achieved time travel yet, but that hasn't stopped it being source of fascination for science fiction writers and illustrations, today, as it was back in the 1930s.
