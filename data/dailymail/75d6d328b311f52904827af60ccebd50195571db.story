Dramatic scenes of a burning boat drifting out into the harbour left Broadchurch fans glued to their screens last week.

But they didn’t much impress the firm which sponsors the ITV crime series – Viking River Cruises.

The firm pulled its adverts from this week’s episode of the show, which stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman as detectives.

Unfortunate: Cruise ship company Viking River Cruises has ended its sponsorship of ITV's Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, after the calamity

The offending scene, which involved a
boat being set on fire to destroy evidence, was aired minutes between 
two clips showing one of the firm’s fleet taking passengers on a cruise.

Wendy Atkin-Smith, managing director 
of Viking River Cruises, confirmed that the firm had pulled its 
sponsorship for the rest of the show’s run because of ‘sensitivities 
around the content’.

She said: ‘We are proud to continue 
as sponsors of Mystery Dramas on ITV. [But] We have taken the decision 
not to continue with our sponsorship of Broadchurch.’

Cruise company Viking River Cruises has ended its sponsorship of Broadchurch after the mishap

Since its premier on March 4 ITV’s 
latest crime drama has held audiences enthralled as police detectives 
David Tennant and Olivia Colman try to unravel the murder of an 
11-year-old boy.

Set in the
fictional Dorset coastal town of Broadchurch the show has attracted 
more than seven million viewers addicted to its complex and twisting 
plotline.

The unfortunate juxtaposition did not
go unnoticed by viewers. One, Joanna Montgomery, joked on Twitter: 
‘Viking River Cruises did not sponsor last year’s ITV blockbuster 
four-part mini-series, Titanic #Broadchurch.’

Another Jerome Turner tweeted: 
‘Seriously, what happened to Viking River Cruises sponsoring 
#Broadchurch? Shame? Budget? Taste?’
