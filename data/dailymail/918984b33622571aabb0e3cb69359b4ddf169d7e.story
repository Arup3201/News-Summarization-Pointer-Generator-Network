London Welsh are in sight of a return to the Premiership after grabbing hold of this two-leg play off for a place among English rugby’s elite.

A disastrous night for Andy Robinson’s Bristol included a serious ankle injury for former Wales captain Ryan Jones.

Jones, parachuted into Bristol’s team from Ospreys this month, fell awkwardly at a line-out and had to be carried off some 28 minutes into a match which saw Welsh, relegated last season, win by three tries to one.

Robinson, the former England and Scotland coach charged with guiding Bristol back to the Premiership after a five-year absence, had no complaints afterwards.

Though disrupted by injuries to Jones and scrum-half Luke Baldwin in the first half, Robinson praised Welsh for completely outplaying his team.

He said: ‘I’m disappointed but London Welsh played very well, we managed to stem the tide a bit in the last 20 minutes otherwise it could have been a lot more than 19 points.

‘They completely outplayed us and played the conditions very well. It’s a huge challenge but we have got another game to go.’

Bristol go into next Wednesday’s second leg needing to quickly cut down Welsh. They did lead through a fifth-minute try from flanker Marco Mama, following a line-out drive, only to be outgunned in the next 30 minutes.

Welsh struck back through another try off a line-out drive by prop Nathan Trevett to be followed by an outstanding score from wing Nick Scott.

Scott raced clear from halfway after good interplay by scrum-half Chris Cook and hooker Nathan Morris.

Welsh led 17-5 at half-time and a third try, early in the second half, by flanker Carl Kirwan increased the margin. Gordon Ross converted that scored and later a penalty to complete a 12-point contribution.

Bristol gained some hope for next Wednesday in the final minutes when substitute fly half Adrian Jarvis added a penalty.

Justin Burnell, Welsh’s head coach, warned afterwards that his team had won nothing yet.

‘There is still a long way to go yet and another match to play. Bristol are capable of scoring points so it’s our defence against their attack next week I expect. It’s all to play for.’
