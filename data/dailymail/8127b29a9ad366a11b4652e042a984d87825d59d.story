Al Qaeda today said a suicide attack on a Yemeni defence compound which left 52 dead and 167 injured was in retaliation for U.S. drone strikes on its militants.

The terrorist group boasted on Twitter that they 'stormed' the facility as part of its war on drones because it was a base from which U.S. personnel operated the remote-controlled planes.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - regarded by Washington as the jihadist network's most dangerous affiliate - has suffered heavy losses after the U.S. intensified drone strikes in Yemen this year.

But there was no immediate evidence to
support its allegation that the Sanaa complex attacked on Thursday 
played any role in the drone war or housed any U.S. personnel.

All of the dead came in a hospital inside the sprawling facility which bore the brunt of the armed assault that came after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into the main gate.

The complex in central Sanaa was 'stormed... after the mujahedeen (holy warriors) proved that it accommodates drone control rooms and American experts,' AQAP said in a statement published by its media arm on Twitter.

'As part of a policy to target drone control rooms, the mujahedeen have dealt a heavy blow to one,' it said.

'Such security headquarters in partnership with the Americans in their war on these Muslim people are a justified target wherever they may be.'

The use of drones to attack suspected 
militants has become an extremely controversial topic with America 
accused of killing innocent people during operations. 

Last
month, American military chiefs had to apologise after mistakenly 
killing three civilians during a drone strike in Afghanistan.

Speaking
at the time, Col. Jane Crichton, director of public affairs for NATO's 
International Security Assistance Force, said a preliminary 
investigation had found that although the airstrike killed eight 
insurgents, ‘there were, unfortunately, believed to be three civilian 
casualties,’ for which the ISAF expressed ‘deep regret.’

U.S.
Air Force Maj. Gen. Ken Wilsbach, who commands air operations in 
Afghanistan, added: ‘Our goal is to eradicate civilian casualties, but 
that is an incredibly difficult task when the enemy is intermixed with 
the civilian population.'

The number of dead from U.S. drone strikes in Yemen remains unclear and estimates vary widely.

According
to the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think-tank that has 
tried to keep track of the numbers, there have been 93 strikes since 
2002 which have killed between 684 and 891 people, among them between 64
and 66 civilians.

According
to a Human Rights Watch report published in October, the US has carried
out 80 targeted operations in Yemen since 2009, including strikes from 
drones, warplanes and cruise missiles - killing at least 473 people.

US
President Barack Obama has defended the drone bombing campaign as an 
effective tool against Al-Qaeda, but has promised to introduce stricter 
rules and oversight for the strikes, including shifting more of the 
operations from the CIA to the military to reduce secrecy.

Devastation: A car bomber and gunmen dressed in army uniforms attacked Yemen's Defence Ministry compound in the capital Sanaa on Thursday morning, killing 52 people

Washington condemned the attack which 
came as Defence Minister Mohammed Nasser headed a military delegation on
a visit to the United States.

Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she had no information about any US casualties.

Two
doctors from Germany, two from Vietnam and another from Yemen were 
killed, as well two female nurses from the Philippines and one from 
India, Yemen's official Saba news agency said.

But
the Philippine foreign ministry gave a higher death toll for its 
nationals, saying that seven had died, all medical staff and including a
doctor.

The remaining 
'martyrs' were all patients in the hospital, including both soldiers and
civilians, among them a top Yemeni judge and his wife, Yemen's supreme 
security committee said.

Saba said 167 people were wounded, nine of them seriously.

The defence ministry said gunmen occupied the hospital after the explosion, but that security forces had regained control of the building.

But residents in Sanaa said the sounds of clashes and explosions rang out from the area and were heard across the capital throughout the night until fighting subsided at dawn on Friday.

The area was cordoned off in the morning while armoured vehicles blocked all roads leading to the defence complex, witnesses said.

A search was mounted for two suspected bomb-laden vehicles the militants were planning to use in more attacks, said security officials, who added that up to 25 militants had carried Thursday's assault.

The brazen daylight attack on the complex followed a spate of hit-and-run strikes on military personnel and officials, as Yemen struggles to complete a thorny political transition.

The attacks have mostly generally been blamed on AQAP, which remains very active despite suffering setbacks in a major army offensive in the south last year and repeated U.S. drone strikes on its commanders.

AQAP has been linked to several attempted attacks on the United States, including a botched bid to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009, which have made it a major target of the US 'war on terror'.
