Brandon Marshall is to be traded for the third time in his NFL career and will join the New York Jets after three years with the Chicago Bears.

The prodigiously talented wide receiver turns 31 this month, but the move had been widely touted.

Deemed an outspoken maverick by many at Soldier Field, he raised eyebrows with a post-game locker room rant after defeat to the Miami Dolphins in October. His appearances as an analyst on 'Inside the NFL' weekly were also said to be a distraction.

The mercurial Marshall is yet to play in the play-offs

New head coach John Fox and offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appeared lukewarm about Marshall at best. 

'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month.

Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse.

ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick.

Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint.

Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game.

Perhaps that will change in New York. New head coach Todd Bowles was with Marshall during his two-year stint in Miami and will have been influential in the trade.

The move will likely mean the end of Percy Harvin's short stint with the Gang Green, with Marshall to pair up with Eric Decker.

Marshall was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft by the Broncos and is a mental health spokesman, spreading awareness of his battle with Borderline Personality Disorder.
