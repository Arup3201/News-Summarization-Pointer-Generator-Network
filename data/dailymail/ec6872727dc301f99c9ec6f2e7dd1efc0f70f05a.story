Behind bars: Nek Alam (pictured), 72, and three of his sons have been jailed for subjecting a vulnerable member of their family, Ghalib Hussein, to a three-year campaign of cruelty

A father and three sons who subjected a child-like man to a campaign of 'Dickensian-like' cruelty because they regarded him as a financial burden on their family have been jailed.

Victim Ghalib Hussain, 27, who cannot read or write, is said to have suffered regular beatings and threats over a three-year period by relatives who wanted to punish him as they believed he was 'slow in the head' and a 'mental case'.

During his ordeal, it was claimed Mr Hussain, who was nicknamed 'The Clown' by his family, had one end of a pair of jump leads clamped onto his nose whilst he was hit with the other end and was whipped with a belt and a stick.

A jury was told he also had to kiss the feet of his uncle whilst in a 'punishment position’ and was given what he called 'pigeon food' - bad food in the house or the leftovers.

He was also not allowed to eat until he was told he could.

On other occasions, Mr Hussain was also allegedly punched in the face when he failed to remember Arabic text taught in a mosque and was also warned he would be buried alive in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out.

He was later rescued by police who found him huddled on a settee at his home in Accrington, Lancashire, and unable to stand due to a broken right hip suffered when he was forced to the ground and jumped on.

He had earlier been found wandering around the town centre and he clung onto a lamp-post in a distressed state when officers tried to take him home.

At Burnley Crown Court, his uncle and Alam’s sons shopworkers Janghir Alam, 29, Zahir Alam, 33, and Zahoor Alam, 32, pleaded guilty to putting Mr Hussain in fear of violence by harassment, between January 2007 and July 2010.

Nek, father of two Zahir and father of four Zahoor were each sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and Janghir also a father of four was jailed for 10 months.

All were acquitted of more serious charges of false imprisonment, making threats to kill and causing grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing.

The jury was told Mr Hussain had been unable to read or write and to speak little or no English and had little or no formal education.

He suffered from epilepsy, was described by certain family members as being 'slow in the head' with little or no knowledge of the world and was said to have no friends.

Jeremy Lasker, prosecuting, said Mr Hussain came to Britain in about 2006 from his native Pakistan as a result of an arranged marriage to Nek Alam’s daughter, Sofia.

She later rejected her husband and the victim was left 'stranded and alone' in the Alam household.

Mr Lasker said: 'It’s pretty clear that he was not regarded with much affection by his relatives. Mr Hussain, the crown say, because of his problems, was unable to work in order to pay his way.

'As a consequence of that, the financial burden for his care and upkeep fell upon the rest of his family.

'It’s against this particular background that Ghalib Hussain was ill-treated and assaulted on a regular and continuing basis by his uncle and cousins.

'Those assaults or beatings appeared to have been carried out for the most part as a result of punishments, either because he had done something wrong or was perceived to have done something wrong.'

Brutal: It was alleged that Zahoor Alam (pictured) took a pair of jump leads, attached one end to Mr Hussain's nose and used the other end to hit the palms of his hands

Mr Lasker said on June 26, 2010 police were asked to look out for a man described as vulnerable and found Mr Hussain, in traditional Asian dress, walking the streets.

A member of the public helped translate and he was asked if the officers could take him home. But he became visibly distressed and was seen to cling to a lamp-post.

'He reported about being beaten and said the people living there would not let him return to Pakistan,' said Mr Lasker.

A relative arrived at the scene and took him home where it is claimed he was subjected to another beating for daring to speak out.

Four days later, a social worker visited the address with a police officer and insisted on speaking with Mr Hussain alone.

He was initially told Mr Hussain was in London, but the victim was found huddled on a settee in a front room. The court heard the victim said he didn’t want to speak loudly in case he was overheard and then told the officer of his treatment.

Mr Lasker said Mr Hussain, who was unable to stand up, was taken to hospital by ambulance on July 1 and had surgery to insert a number of screws in his broken right hip.

He remained there until July 20. On his release, he gave an account of what he claimed had happened to him.

The prosecutor said the crown alleged that on June 26, 2010, Mr Hussain had been forced to the ground and Zahir and Zahoor Alam then put their weight on him and jumped on his leg. Janghir Alam hit him with his belt.

Mr Lasker claimed: 'The crown say he was made, whilst on the floor, to kiss Nek Alam’s feet whilst he was in a punishment position and told he would be buried alive in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out.

It was alleged that Zahoor Alam took a pair of jump leads, attached one end to the victim’s nose and used the other end to hit the palms of his hands.

The father and sons were later arrested. Mr Lasker told the jury: 'These four defendants deny any of this cruel and violent behaviour which the crown say took place.'

When interviewed and arrested, Nek Alam said Mr Hussain was 'mentally sick' and was spoilt by his grandmother.

Janghir Alam said he was 'a burden', while Zahir Alam said he had 'a childish mind' and would be referred to as 'the clown or the mental case'.

Mr Hussain was now in a care home and his immigration status was in a state of flux, as, was his future well-being. He gave evidence to the jury for several days, screened from the defendants. He had been accompanied by carers who now look after him.

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'I am satisfied that this is a case where frustrated reactions to Mr Hussain’s behaviour, overflowed and the behaviour was clearly, it seems to me, as a result of Ghalib Hussain’s disability.'

After the case, Det Sgt Julie Cross of Lancashire Police said: 'The victim was subjected to years of harassment and emotional abuse and has been treated in the most dreadful manner. To treat a family member in this way is appalling.'
