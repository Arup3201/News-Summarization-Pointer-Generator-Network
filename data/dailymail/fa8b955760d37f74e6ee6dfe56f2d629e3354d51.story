The BBC sends out almost 100,000 letters every working day threatening viewers with £1,000 fines unless they pay the TV licence fee.

MPs accused the corporation of heavy-handed bullying after it emerged it posted 47million letters demanding payment in the past two years.

The mass mail-outs cost the BBC around £5million a year, the equivalent of 34,000 licence fees, even though only around 5 per cent of homes avoid the £145.50 charge.

In total, the BBC’s enforcement arm 
TV Licensing spends more than £100million a year collecting payments, 
almost 3p for every pound it manages to collect.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said the figures showed the BBC has ‘got its priorities all wrong’. He added: ‘While
 everyone should pay their bills, there is a strong element here of 
chasing people for a television poll tax which can be viewed as 
counter-productive.

'The
 BBC needs to map out a future away from total reliance on a  licence 
fee to one where it focuses on producing quality programmes that the 
public wants.’

The first licence fee was issued in November 1922 for radio users, and cost a princely 10 shillings (50p).

The first combined Radio/TV licence - for £2 - was issued in June 1946.

As television became popular, radio-only licences were abolished in February 1971.

The first supplementary licence fee for colour TV was introduced in January 1968.

The original iPlayer service was launched as a five-month trial in October 2005, with 5,000 broadband users testing it.

It was then gradually rolled out and made available to more people across the UK until in 2011 an international version was launched.

A television licence is not needed to watch iPlayer content after it has been broadcast. 

A 
freedom of information request revealed that the BBC sent 25.1million 
threatening letters to homes without a TV licence last year, up from 
21.5million the year before.

It means 99,200 letters were sent every working day last year.

Many
 homes received multiple letters, warning them of the large fines and 
possible prison sentences that can be imposed for non-payment.

Last
 year 153,369 people were cautioned or convicted for not paying their TV
 licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates’ court cases.

Many
 were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record. 
Between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to 
pay the court fines.

The
 corporation’s army of licence fee collectors are paid a bonus every 
time they bring a TV viewer to court, further driving up the number of 
prosecutions.

Following
 a backbench campaign earlier this year led by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, 
the Government has promised to review the licence fee arrangements and 
consider decriminalising non-payment.

Last night Mr Bridgen said the number of letters being sent out was ‘symptomatic of the BBC’s heavy-handed approach’.

He added: ‘It shows it is completely out of touch with the public.

The
 BBC treats the licence fee as a poll tax that everyone has to pay, and 
spends millions of pounds of our money harassing people.’

Despite the fact that only five per cent of the 26.4 million households in Britain evade the payment, 46 million letters were still sent out by TV Licensing in the past two years

John
 O’Connell, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The number of 
warning letters sent out on taxpayers’ money seems entirely 
disproportionate to the number of people failing to pay the licence fee.

‘More
 people would be able to pay the outdated licence fee more easily if the
 BBC could cut out waste and charge people less in the first place.’

A
 TV Licensing spokesman said: ‘The low cost of collection – 2.7p for 
every pound collected – and low evasion at between 5 to 6 per cent, is 
evidence that what we do works so to describe it as waste is simply wrong.

‘All our mailing campaigns to unlicensed households generate substantially more revenue than they cost.’

Anyone watching or recording TV programmes on any channel as they are being broadcast. Whatever device you use to watch programmes – a TV set, computer, laptop or mobile phone – you must pay the £145.50 licence fee. Over-75s are entitled to a free licence. Anyone without a valid licence risks prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000.

WHAT CAN YOU WATCH WITHOUT ONE?

Programmes on the iPlayer, the BBC's catch-up service, provided you view them after they have been broadcast. Those using the iPlayer's Watch Live function, which broadcasts eight channels at virtually the same time as on TV, will need a licence.

HOW CAN BBC TELL WHO WATCHES LIVE OR CATCH-TV? 

It can't. It relies on honesty. Anyone not paying a licence fee has to submit a declaration that they are not watching or recording live broadcasts. Licence enforcers can make house visits to check and if your explanation is accepted, they put your account on 'hold' for two years, before investigating again.
