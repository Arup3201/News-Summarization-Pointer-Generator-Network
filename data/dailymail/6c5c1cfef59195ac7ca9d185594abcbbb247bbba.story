The husband suspected of killing his spouse during an Australian honeymoon scuba diving trip to get insurance money arrived at court yesterday with his new wife as jury selection for his U.S. trial began.

Gabe Watson, 34, of Alabama, allegedly drowned Tina, 26, in 2003 by turning off her air supply, although he claims her death was a tragic accident resulting from panic, fatigue and heavy currents

He turned up at court in Birmingham, Alabama, with his new wife Kim Lewis, who bears a strong resemblance to Tina. The trial over the Great Barrier Reef death is expected to last three weeks.

Watson initially was charged with 
murder in Australia, after Tina’s body was found near Townsville, 
Queensland, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and 
served 18 months in prison.

A
grand jury in Alabama also indicted him for capital murder as he 
allegedly planned his new bride's death while still in the state. A 
judge granted a defence motion to have one murder count dropped.

Before
Australian authorities would release Watson to the U.S., Alabama had to
agree to waive the death penalty as a possible punishment, prosecutors 
said. He faces life in prison if convicted.

Australian
authorities performed exhaustive tests to try to recreate Tina Watson's
death, which occurred 11 days after the couple's wedding. A coroner’s 
report threw up some interesting ideas.

Gabe Watson said his wife looked 
concerned seven minutes into their dive and knocked his mask off in 
panic. By the time he retrieved the mask, he said Tina was sinking too 
fast for him to catch her.

'What insurance? There was no insurance that Gabe was going to get'

Brett Bloomston, defending

Tina
was an inexperienced diver and he had earned rescue certification. The 
trial in Alabama poses some logistical challenges. Up to a dozen 
witnesses will be flown in from Australia to testify.

The
state of Alabama has also subpoenaed people from California to testify 
about what happened that day on a dive boat called the Spoilsport, but 
it's unclear how many will take the stand.

Queensland coroner David Glasgow said a modest insurance policy could have provided a motive.

Tina’s
father, Tommy Thomas, claims Watson asked to be named a beneficiary 
before the wedding and requested an upgrade to the maximum amount, 
according to the coroner's report.

'This is our last chance to get justice. If the bulk of the evidence is presented it doesn't matter whether it's a jury in Alabama or a jury in Australia, we're going to get a just outcome'

'This
is our last chance to get justice,' he said. ‘If the bulk of the 
evidence is presented it doesn't matter whether it's a jury in Alabama 
or a jury in Australia, we're going to get a just outcome.'

Prosecutor
Don Valeska said a potential $220,000 in insurance money was at stake 
from a life insurance policy and travel insurance. The defence disputes 
Watson was due to receive any money.

‘What
insurance? There was no insurance that Gabe was going to get,’ said 
Watson defence attorney Brett Bloomston. ‘I am anxious to hear what they
come up with as a reason.’
