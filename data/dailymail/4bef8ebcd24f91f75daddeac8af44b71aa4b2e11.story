Olympian Steph Prem’scareer was cut short after a devastating fall in 2010

A devastating fall saw Olympian Steph Prem’s snowboarding career cut short - but she has no regrets.

Skiing on the slopes for a living was her everything until 2010 when one bad jump in the World Cup finals in Italy changed the Melbourne woman's life forever.

Despite the entire left side of her body taking the brunt of the fall - complete with fractured vertebrae, compressed discs, a dislocated hip, five broken ribs, a torn pelvis and hamstring - Prem, who competed under her maiden name of Hickey, could only think about getting back up in the air.

But four years on, the 29-year-old has accepted her fate of never being able to compete again and has gained an unexpected love of Pilates throughout her long and arduous road to recovery.

On that day back in in April 2010, Prem had been taking it easy on the last jump because many female competitors had injured themselves.

‘My coach said to me “unless you’ve got the speed - don’t hit it” and I really thought I had it - I came into the last turn with a lot of speed and just before I came off the jump the take-off was incorrect and the minute I tried to correct myself I knew was in trouble,’ she said.

Prem has spent four years doing hard core rehabilitation to no longer live in constant pain

She tried both traditional and alternative methods to help improve and strengthen her body

This was the first and last time Prem, who had been a professional snowboarder for eight years and had just competed in her first Olympics in Vancouver a few months earlier, would ever experience such a terrifying realisation.

‘When you’re in the air and you’ve got time to think about how much trouble you are in – you are in a lot of trouble,’ she said.

Prem admits she could not be told by anyone that she would never compete again – she had to figure it out herself over time.

She tried everything for her constant pain including Valium, spinal cortisone injections and nerve ending operations but nothing worked.

Four years on, she still does corrective exercise and rehabilitation every week for her injuries

Prem said it took her a long time to accept she would never compete as a snowboarder again

After much trial and error, it was a combination of both traditional methods, such as rehabilitation and correctional exercise, along with alternative measures that has worked for her.

‘The last year and a half I have also tried Chinese medicine, detoxing and liver cleansers to try to rid my body of imflammation and pain,’ she said.

She also has a strict diet and solid cleansing for her body - and swears by massage and acupuncture.

‘I had to try a lot of different things and be open-minded to a lot of different treatments because I was finding I was in a lot of pain for a long time and not a lot was helping.’

But it wasn’t until she tried Pilates three years ago - and was relieved to discover an exercise she could do without experiencing any pain - that her quality of life improved out of sight.

‘It completely changed my whole way of being because before the accident I was addicted to daily exercise as a professional athlete but I lost that with my injury,' she said.

'I had been so limited and restricted in what I could do that it was so awesome to discover Pilates because a lot of the work was protected using the machinery.'

'But also the lower deeper intrinsic work that I was doing gave me back that daily outlet and there was so much I could achieve,' she said.

'It gives you strength from the inside out – it helped me massively mentally and physically because I could do something again.'

While still deep in her own rehabilitation, Prem decided to start up her own Pilates studio in Melbourne, Premium Performance

While still deep in her own rehabilitation, Prem decided to start up her own Pilates studio, Premium Performance, in Melbourne,  to help women of all ages to feel better about themselves.

She is now feels so fulfilled by teaching Pilates that she doesn't miss being a professional sportswoman despite her competitive nature.

But nothing could ever stop her from continuing to play on the ski slopes. 

'I was thrilled to get back on the board two years ago - it came quite naturally like riding a bike but of course I have limitations since the accident - like hitting 60 foot jumps,' she said. 

'My husband and I take people on ski holiday tours, and in February was the first time I could ski for a week straight without being in pain.'

‘2014 is the healthiest and most out of pain I have been in four years which is amazing but it was three solid years of a lot of hard work,' she said.

‘I still see a rehab specialist twice a week that’s the reality of the injury.'
