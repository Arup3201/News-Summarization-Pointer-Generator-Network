Newcastle United are this season’s ‘crisis club’ and manager Alan Pardew is already clinging to his job with the campaign just six games old.

A 1-0 defeat at Stoke on Monday night has reopened the debate over his future – not that the subject was ever closed – and leaves the Magpies joint bottom of the Premier League. Indeed, they have collected just 19 points from a possible 81 since Boxing Day.

Owner Mike Ashley, however, is set to keep faith with the 53-year-old in the short term and a trip to Swansea is next up on Saturday.

But there is very definitely trouble in Toon right now. Here, Sportsmail looks at 10 contributing factors to their peril…

Alan Pardew – The manager has been in charge for four years, enjoying good times and bad. Don’t forget, he was Premier League and LMA Manager of the Year in 2012 and there was talk of admiring eyes being cast from the Football Association. 

But sometimes a tenure simply runs its course and there is a definite feel of that with Pardew and Newcastle. Supporters have, at times, accepted the boss, but very few have taken fondly to him. A change for both parties seems like the sensible solution right now.

No ambition – Ashley’s wish is to renew the club’s top-flight status season on season, thus lining the coffers. There is no desire to follow the model of a club such as Everton and, with similar resources, make a bid to break the top four.

When they did finish fifth in 2012, United’s subsequent involvement in the Europa League was viewed as an inconvenience and the season almost finished in relegation – and Ashley does not want that. Hence, then, the policy of deprioritising the domestic cup competitions, something which has angered supporters starved of silverware since 1969.

Poor relations – The club have banned three local newspapers and several national titles are also barred from St James’ Park. Relations with sections of the Press, therefore, are strained to say the least and this has eroded any notion of ‘good will’ towards the club, something which is particularly important from your local papers in times of trouble.

Fan frustration – The Toon Army will never accept Ashley and, as long as he remains in ownership, unrest will always lurk beneath the surface, even in good times, should they ever return. 

They, like all football fans, want to be sold a dream, a vision, a reason for putting down £50 every fortnight. Sadly, romance is dead on Tyneside and fans love nothing more than to hate the regime right now.

English core is no more – When Newcastle won promotion back to the Premier League and then re-established themselves as a top-flight outfit – first under Chris Hughton and then Pardew – they did so with an English blue-chip brigade. 

Steve Harper, Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Joey Barton, Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll were the standard bearers and kept affairs on and off the pitch in check. None of those players remain at the club and have instead been replaced by foreign imports who see United as a stepping stone to bigger things – Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Demba Ba and Mathieu Debuchy are four who have used Tyneside as a launch pad.

Poor signings – ‘Super scout’ Graham Carr can point to some fine discoveries on the continent, but this summer’s soccermarket sweep is yet to bear fruit. Remy Cabella has looked more like a 12-year-old on a playground than a £12million playmaker on a Premier League pitch.

New signing Emmanuel Riviere is yet to score a Premier League goal for the Magpies in six attempts

Striker Emmanuel Riviere – a £6m addition from Monaco – is yet to score in the league and was hooked at half-time against Stoke. At least Riviere has been judged good enough to start, which is more than can be said for fellow frontmen Ayoze Perez and Facundo Ferreyra, a pair of unknowns who remain a mystery.

No goals – United have drawn a blank in four of six league games this season and failed to score in 13 from 20 at the back end of the last campaign. 

The club have known since May that a goalscorer was needed to replace Loic Remy, yet no-one with any Premier League pedigree has arrived. Papiss Cisse – scorer of two against Hull – offers a glimmer of hope, but he was horribly out of form last season and netted just twice in the league.

No case for defence – On paper, United’s back five makes for assured reading – Holland internationals Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat, skipper Fabricio Coloccini, Mike Williamson and Geordie lad Paul Dummett. 

On grass, however, they are a constant source of worry for Pardew and supporters. Opposition teams rarely have to work hard for a score against United and they have shipped 12 from six in the league this season.

Injuries hurt – Injuries, of course, happen – that is why squads are built and allowance made for cover. United, though, do not have the depth to absorb loss in key positions. Ajax captain Siem de Jong had looked the most promising of the summer signings until a torn thigh muscle ruled him out until Christmas.

Manchester City are the only top seven side to play Newcastle, yet Magpies have collected just three points

And it says a lot when a hamstring injury suffered by 18-year-old Rolando Aarons – who is yet to start a league game – is described by Pardew as a ‘major blow’.

Playing catch-up – The Premier League fixture list was kind to Newcastle, opening against champions Manchester City apart. But subsequent home games against Crystal Palace and Hull – as well as trips to Aston Villa, Southampton and Stoke – have produced just three points. 

Those games are gone now, you don’t get them back. That means away matches at last season’s top seven still lie in wait, while all of the big boys – other than City – are yet to visit Tyneside.
