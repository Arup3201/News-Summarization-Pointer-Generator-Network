Police have charged 14 people with participating in a fraternity hazing incident that ended with a 19-year-old southwest Ohio college student having a 
testicle surgically removed.

Tyler Lawrence underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a knotted towel, severely damaging one testicle

Police made the arrests Thursday after an investigation into the Halloween incident at Wilmington College's Gamma Phi Gamma house.

Court records said a fraternity pledge was injured when he was struck with a towel 'fashioned as a weapon.'

Tyler Lawrence 
underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a 
knotted towel on October 30, severely damaging one testicle.

Jim Reynolds, president of the Quaker college of about 1,000 students southeast of Dayton, says the conduct is unacceptable.

The fraternity has been kicked off campus until at least 2019

The fraternity, which claims to have existed since 1907, appealed the ruling but the punishment was upheld.

The Smoking Gun reported Lawrence was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus, when he was injured.

The trouble began when the students were 
blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had
been filled with about three inches of water.

They were then ordered to lie on the wet floor and pretend they were swimming.

Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold.

As part of the initiation, the pledges had Limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing'

As
the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members
allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on 
their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums.

According to a police affidavit, about 20
Gamma Phi Gamma members either actively participated in the ritual or 
watched from the sidelines.

As
 part of the initiation, the pledges had Limburger cheese stuffed into 
their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of 
stuffing'.

Things took a
 dangerous turn when, according to the police affidavit, the fraternity 
members hit the pledges with towels and shirts that had their ends tied 
in knots.

Lawrence was struck in the testicles and crumpled to the ground, clutching his injured groin in pain, the affidavit stated.

The criminal justice major was then 
helped to his feet, and the rite continued with the brothers stuffing 
bananas soaked in vinegar into the mouths of the three pledges, who were
 told that they were eating excrement.

Following
 the 'Gobbler House' initiation, Lawrence complained of severe pain in 
his groin and was rushed to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where doctors had
 to cut off a testicle that was damaged in the alleged hazing.

The Clinton County prosecutor's office says each suspect is charged with either misdemeanor assault or hazing.
