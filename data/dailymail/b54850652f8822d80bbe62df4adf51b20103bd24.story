A drunk driver who killed a 57-year-old motorcyclist when he sped through a red light last year will only have to spend 120 days in prison - a light sentence that has infuriated the victim's already heartbroken family.

Ronald O'Kelly, 25, plead guilty to charges of involuntary vehicular manslaughter due to intoxication and fleeing the scene on Friday, in connection with the tragic April 2013 accident that killed Kansas City man Leroy 'Buddy' Bronson.

Bronson's death was the third in a family plagued by drunk driving accidents. Three years ago, Bronson's wife Diane and his 11-year-old daughter Anna were killed when a drunk driver going the wrong way on the freeway smashed into their white Ford Explorer.

'This is horrible. This is disgusting. What is our judicial system saying? Drink? Drive? Kill somebody? Run! You're fine,' Bronson's stepson Tyler Bronson told WFSB in court on Friday.

O'Kelly did not issue a statement as he left the court room last week.

However, in court O'Kelly apologized to the Bronson family and said the man's death was something he will have to live with forever.

'Since the accident I have thought about it every day, and there is nothing I can say that will make anything better,' he said.

'I’m super sorry about what happened,' he added. 'I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, just like you guys will.'

O'Kelly had spent the night Of April 7, 2013 getting drunk at a tavern, witnesses said, before he ran a red light and crashed into Bronson driving his motorcycle.

From there, O'Kelly fled on foot, but responding police officers were able to find his Ford F-150 with damage just a few hundred feet from the crash scene.

They traced the plates back to O'Kelly, and the young man turned himself into police the next day, accompanied by his lawyer.

Bronson was pronounced dead just after midnight. 

In an interview with the Kansas City Star, Tyler Bronson recalls the moment local police knocked on his door to notify him that yet another member of his family had died.

'I couldn’t even imagine why they were at my door at 2:30 in the morning on a Sunday, because you wouldn’t think the same thing could happen twice.

Not Ok: Bronson's stepson Tyler Bronson was outraged at the court's decision to sentence O'Kelly to just 120 days in prison

'At least, not until I saw the look on their face when I opened the door. It was the same look I had seen on the Kansas City police officers’ face not quite two years earlier,' Bronson said.

In court on Friday, O'Kelly was handed down a seven-year prison sentence on the manslaughter charge and four years for fleeing the scene.

But Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Sandra Midkiff said those two sentences would be suspended if O'Kelly serves 120 in prison without issue.

After those 120 days are up, O'Kelly will be on probation.

However, this sentence is typical for offenders in Jackson County. According to state corrections records, from 2009 to 2013, eight out of 10 involuntary manslaughter due to intoxication convictions ended in a probation sentence.

The Bronson family are currently pursuing a wrongful death lawsuit against O'Kelly.
