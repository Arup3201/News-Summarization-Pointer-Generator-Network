Michael Wheatley, 55, a violent armed robber dubbed 'the Skull Cracker'

A violent armed robber dubbed the 'Skull Cracker' is believed to have travelled to London by train after going missing from an open prison in Kent, police revealed today.

Officers said Michael Wheatley boarded the 9.20am high speed Javelin train from Sittingbourne, which was heading to Stratford International station.

He was seen in Twickenham at 19.55 last night, but when police arrived at the address which is believe to be associated with the 55-year-old prisoner, he had disappeared.

Despite an extensive search of the area he could not be found and today the Metropolitan Police warned residents in the area not to approach him if they see him again. 

Wheatley went missing when he was temporarily released from HMP 
Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey.

The prisoner was handed 13 
life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002.

Wheatley raided 13 building societies and banks over 10 months in 2001 and 2002 while on parole from a 27-year sentence for other robberies.

He earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids.

Ministers have been urged to reconsider moving violent offenders to open prisons following Wheatley's disappearance.

Conservative former minister Nick Gibb
 warned there had been a 'pattern of absconding' at HMP Ford in his 
constituency, including two men convicted of murder.

Mr
 Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) told Policing Minister Damian 
Green in the Commons: 'When considering a sentencing policy for those 
guilty of observing or engaging in violent behaviour, will you 
reconsider the department's policy of moving violent offenders, such as 
Michael Wheatley, to open prisons like Standford Hill in Kent.

'You will be aware of the pattern of absconding that has taken place in Ford Open Prison in my constituency.

'In
 particular, Derek Passmore and Paul Flint, both of whom were convicted 
of murder and one of whom had already absconded from an open prison.'

Mr Green replied: 'I am sure across the House many of us will share your concern at people absconding.

'As
 we've heard today, the number of people absconding from open prisons 
has of course gone down, but I hope you are reassured we are already in 
the process of making conditions for those sent to an open prison 
tougher, both in terms of those qualifying to go to open prisons and 
also the punishments received for those who break the terms.'

Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said there will be a 
full review of the case, including an assessment of the release on 
temporary licence (ROTL) process.

Mr
 Wright said temporary licence can be an important tool to help 
offenders reintegrate into communities but that 'it should not be an 
automatic right'.

Ministers
 have said there will be a toughening up of the licence scheme so that 
prisoners are subjected to stricter risk assessments and tagged.

Mr
 Wright said: 'We are not prepared to see public safety compromised, the
 system has been too lax up to now and we are changing that.

'In
 future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be 
tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under 
strict conditions before being released.

'Temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but it should not be an automatic right.

'There will be a full review of this case which will look at the ROTL process.'

Conservative backbencher Philip 
Davies said that whoever had allowed Wheatley out of prison was 'a berk'
 and questioned why he was in an open prison in the first place.

The
 MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire said: 'It is completely ludicrous that
 a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison where they 
can simply walk out.

'As far as I am concerned whoever allowed him to be in an open prison should be sacked, it is a complete disgrace.

'The
 top priority for the prison service should be the protection of the 
public. (Justice Secretary) Chris Grayling needs to put in charge of the
 prison service someone who will see protection of the public as a top 
priority.'

Police have warned the public not to approach Wheatley if they see him.

A
 Kent Police spokesman said: 'Anyone with any information or who sees 
Wheatley is asked to not approach him and to instead contact police by 
calling 999.'

The spokesman said Wheatley, originally of Limehouse in east London, has links across south east England.

Wheatley admitted 13 charges of robbery and 13 of possessing an imitation firearm - a blank firing semi-automatic pistol - in October 2002.

The robberies between June 2001 and April the following year were mainly on small branches in areas he knew, ranging from Southampton in Hampshire to Royston in Hertfordshire.

The first was just three weeks after he was paroled from his first prison term.

As the robberies continued, so did the violence he used towards staff and customers.

In March 2002 he pistol whipped a 73-year-old woman and a building society manager.

The
 Old Bailey heard at the time he would often grab a female customer, 
putting the pistol to their head, leaving many mentally anguished.

His raids netted him more than Â£45,000.

Michael Wheatley, 55, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 2002, has failed to return to HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Police said

He was given a five-year sentence on each of the firearm offences to run concurrently with the life sentences on each of the robbery charges.

He was ordered to serve a minimum of eight years before being eligible for consideration for parole.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is now a matter for the police and we are supporting them in their investigation.

'We are toughening up the release on temporary licence scheme so that prisoners will be subject to stricter risk assessments and tagged.'

Clare Townsend, who had a gun held to her head by Michael Wheatley

A terrified woman victim of a 
fugitive armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' lashed out at 
officials last night for putting him in an open jail as he was prepared 
for release.

One
 of Wheatley's victims Clare Townsend, 70, said she was 'shocked' to 
find he was in an open prison and said he is almost certain to rob 
again.

The retired 
headteacher said she will never forget the day he held a gun to her 
temple while holding up a branch of the Halifax bank in Raynes Park, 
South West London.

'Having 
been on the end of his violence, I would not have thought he was the 
sort of person that should be in an open prison,' she said.

'I
 thought he had escaped from an ordinary prison. When I realised he was 
in an open prison and he had permission to be out, I was very shocked.'

Recalling
 her ordeal at Wheatley's hands, the retired headteacher said: 'Suddenly
 he swung round, grabbed me by the neck, put a gun to my temple and 
started screaming at the cashiers.

'In
 that instant I thought he was going to kill me, because he just seemed 
so angry. It was almost as though I had personally done something and if
 he didn't get his money, I would personally be thwarting him.

'He
 was an extremely frightening and threatening, character. I know they 
[the police] felt he was an exceedingly dangerous person.

'That's why it's astonishing that all 
their hardwork in arresting him and sentencing him appropriately has 
somewhat been lost by allowing him to go to an open prison.'
