The Jamaica Inn on Bodmin and its 6.5-acre site is on the market for £2 million

The haunted inn on the Cornish coast that formed the backdrop for Daphne du Maurier's bestselling tale about murderous wreckers is on the market for £2 million.

Jamaica Inn inspired the famous du Maurier novel which was later adapted into the 1939 Hitchcock film and a 1983 television drama starring Jane Seymour.

The story will be returning to screens later this year when Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay will take the lead role in a new BBC adaptation.

The inn and its 6.5-acre site is now being sold by owners John and Wendy Watts.

Mr and Mrs Watts have been running the inn since 1973, inviting fans of the famous writer to stay in one of their 17-bedrooms, which are named after characters from the novel.

The site is surrounded by the Cornish coves and estates familiar to du Maurier enthusiasts.

The couple have also established a museum on-site that Mr Watts says has 'probably the finest genuine collection of smuggling artefacts in the country'.

The museum and its entire collection, which includes du Maurier's original writing desk, will be sold with the inn, and the owners also expect the majority of the staff to stay on.

The site, which is being sold via Christie & Co, will essentially be 'sold as seen', according to director Matthew Smith.

He said: 'We anticipate strong interest from the start. Hopefully it won't be on the market for too long.'

The du Maurier novel is considered to be a Gothic classic, telling the tale of a ruthless, bloody gang who lured ships onto the rocks on the Cornish coastline before murdering the survivors and robbing them.

The hotel has a similarly eerie history. Built in 1750, Jamaica Inn was used as a coaching inn by weary travellers using the turnpike between Launceston and Bodmin.

Travellers would stay a night at the remote and isolated inn after having made the treacherous journey across the moor.

Jamaica Inn is the story of young Mary Yellan who is forced to move in with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies.

When Mary arrives in Launceston she discovers her aunt living under the rule of her husband, Joss Merlyn, who is the crooked keeper of Jamaica Inn.

Mary quickly falls into a life of crime, joining the group of wreckers led by Joss and his brother, Jem, who run ships aground and murder sailors to steal their loot.

Against her better judgement she develops feelings for Jem, a penny thief whose crimes are less severe than his older brother's.

After several attempts to expose Joss as the criminal he is, Mary discovers him alongside her Aunt Patience who have been stabbed to death.

She returns to her native Helford, but flees one day after seeing her beloved Jem walking across the moors with all his possessions.

The building is also reputed to be one of the most haunted places in Britain.

Mr Watts, 76, said: 'My wife and I have stayed there on a few occasions in the old part of the building and at night the room would go very cold. That's all I am going to say - it is totally unexplainable.'

'We also get a lot of visitors who have had funny experiences. The old generator house [which has since been redeveloped] was definitely a very eerie spot and most people didn't want to go in there.'

Du Maurier's bestselling novel has been enjoyed by generations through the many screen adaptaions of the tale.

Maureen O'Hara made her name in Alfred Hitchcock's 1939 film.

Jane Seymour starred in the 1983 television drama.

The tale is set to return to our screens later this year, when former star of Downton Abbey Jessica Brown Findlay will take on the leading role in a new three-part BBC adaptation.

It is thought Jamaica Inn may have originally got its name from the infamous rum trade carried out there.

Some visitors were reported to use the inn to hide the contraband they had smuggled ashore.

It is estimated that half of the brandy and a quarter of the tea being smuggled into the UK at this time came in via the Devon and Cornish coasts.

This was comparatively simple as there were few people around to enforce the law.

Even when a smuggler was caught, he was usually dealt with leniently by the presiding magistrates, most of whom were apparently willing recipients of the smuggled goods.

Jamaica Inn and its 6.5-acre site is being sold by Christie & Co for £2 million.
