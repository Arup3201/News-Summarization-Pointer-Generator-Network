Proposal: Diesel drivers could face a charge of £10 when driving through central London from 2020

Drivers of diesel cars face financial penalties to curb air pollution in city centres.

Under plans drawn up by London Mayor Boris Johnson, nearly all diesel vehicle drivers would be hit by a £10 charge to drive into Central London, while other cities are considering introducing low-emission zones to crack down on diesel fumes.

Mr Johnson will also lobby the Government to raise road tax on diesel cars to encourage motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles.

Elsewhere, Labour is planning a network of low-emission zones that would force older diesel vehicles out of many cities. 

Sheffield, Leicester, Bradford, Birmingham, Bristol and 15 other cities are considering bringing in the zones to cope with poor air quality.

The changes in London, which would come into effect in 2020, would mean diesel drivers would have to pay an additional £10 to drive into London’s ‘ultra low emission zone’. 

The area will have the same boundaries as the Congestion Charge zone, and only diesel vehicles that meet the Euro 6 emissions standard will be exempt from the charge.

Petrol cars registered before 2006 will also have to pay.

The threat of heavy fines for breaches of air pollution rules, set by the European Commission, have driven the new initiatives to cut diesel fumes. 

The commission launched legal proceedings against Britain in February.

Plans: The proposed scheme  by London Mayor Boris Johnson is part of a bid to combat air pollution in cities

Findings released in February revealed the most polluted roads in central London, with Oxford Street, Park Lane and Buckingham Palace being among the polluted hotspots in the capital

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that London, Birmingham and Leeds would be exposed to dangerous air pollution from vehicle exhausts until the 2030s unless tougher action was taken.

Matthew Pencharz, Mr Johnson’s environment adviser, told The Times: ‘We want to see an unwinding of incentives that have driven people to diesel.

‘Euro engine standards on emissions have not delivered the savings expected, meaning we now have a legacy of a generation of dirty diesels.’
