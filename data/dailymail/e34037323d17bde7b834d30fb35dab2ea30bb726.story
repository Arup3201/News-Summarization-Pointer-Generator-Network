The American photojournalist infected with Ebola has landed in the U.S. after returning on a specially-contained medical flight from Liberia. 

Ashoka Mukpo, a freelancer from Providence, Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC when he fell ill last Wednesday.

He left Liberia around 5.30pm (ET) and stopped for a brief refueling in Bangor, Maine on Monday morning before continuing to Omaha, Nebraska. 

Mr Mukpo is the fifth American flown home to be treated for the deadly virus and the second patient taken to Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit.

Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance journalist from Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC in Liberia. His jet landed on Monday in Maine for refueling before continuing to Nebraska where he will be treated in a specialized bio-containment unit

The 33-year-old flew out on a jet equipped with an isolation pod that separates him from his caregivers during the flight.  

Mukpo's mother, father and English girlfriend Helen all planned to make the trip to Nebraska to support him. 

In an NBC interview aired  on Monday, Mr Mukpo's mother, Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, said she was heartened by the fact her son was about to receive excellent medical care.

The cameraman's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, said his son had told him on the phone that he was just trying to get through each day before returning to the U.S. 

Dr Levy earlier told the Providence Journal: 'My heart sunk. He said, ''Dad pick up your phone. Answer the phone. I think I'm in trouble.'''

He added: 'He still has the fever. But his spirits are very good, I have to say. I think he's continually sustained by the fact that he knows he's coming home.'

When he arrives at the Nebraska hospital on Monday morning, a team of more than 40 medical staff members - include registered nurses, respiratory therapists, patient-care technicians - will be on hand to support his needs.

Mr Mukpo's father Dr Mitchell Levy and his mother Lady Diana Judith Mukpo said their son's prognosis remains good and they were relieved he had returned to the U.S.

Mr Mukpo took off in a specially-designed jet that includes 'an isopod' - a plastic enclosure with a filtration system - that allows safe transport of highly infectious patients. 

The hospital's biocontainment unit was created in 2005 specifically to handle illnesses like this, said Dr. Phil Smith, who oversees the unit.

'We are ready, willing and able to care for this patient,' Smith said. 'We consider it our duty to give these American citizens the best possible care we can.' 

Doctors at the isolation unit - the largest of four nationwide - would evaluate Mr Mukpo when he arrives before determining how to treat him. 

They said they will apply the lessons learned while treating American aid worker Dr Rick Sacra in September. 

Dr Sacra was successfully treated in the Nebraska unit and was allowed to return to his home in Massachusetts after three weeks, on September 25. 

'Truly, focusing on symptom management is key with these patients,' Dr. Rosanna Morris said Friday. 

Mr Mukpo has been involved in securing workers' rights in the West African countries and was a former advocate for an NGO

Dr Sacra received an experimental Tekmira Pharmaceuticals drug called TKM-Ebola, as well as two blood transfusions from another American aid worker who recovered from Ebola at an Atlanta hospital. 

The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease. Dr Sacra also received supportive care, including IV fluids and aggressive electrolyte management. 

Mr Mukpo's family won't be allowed to embrace or touch but will communicate and see each other via camera.

'It will be the equivalent of Skype, to be honest. But that's OK. He'll know we're there. He'll see us on a monitor.'

Levy has said that doctors are optimistic about his son's prognosis.

Mukpo was hired last Tuesday to be the second cameraman in Liberia for NBC's chief medical editor and correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman.

Speaking on NBC's Today show on Friday, Mr Mukpo's mother Diana, a British aristocrat, spoke of her concern for her son.

'I think the enormous anxiety that I have as a mother or that we share as parents is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday,' she said.

Dr Snyderman and her team also were returning to the U.S. and being placed in quarantine for 21 days 'in an abundance of caution,' NBC News President Deborah Turness said on Thursday.

In a phone interview with Today on Friday, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles.

She believes she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant.'

Mukpo has been working in Liberia for three years for Vice News and other media outlets.

Before the Ebola outbreak, he had been doing nonprofit development work in Liberia.
