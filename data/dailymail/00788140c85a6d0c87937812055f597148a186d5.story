When, on Monday morning, James Taylor reflected on his 90 the day before at the Premadasa, what lingered was not his answers to the inevitable questions about his height or about the patronising dismissal of his talents by one or two. No, it was his frustration.

Built like a pole he may not be, but in that moment Taylor was nothing less than totemic.

His frustration lay in his treatment by the selectors, who had previously granted him only two one-day internationals in Ireland and a couple of Tests against Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander. Thanks, in other words, a bunch.

Cook returns to lead the team after serving a one-match ban for England's slow over-rate in the series 

Yet in Colombo’s stultifying heat and humidity he did for England what he has been doing for some time for Nottinghamshire. To express surprise at the power of his hitting was to admit to being out of touch.

Frustrated, James? Then join the club. For it took England until the fourth one-dayer of this series to stumble across the batting line-up most likely to unnerve opponents at the World Cup.

Alas, no sooner has something promising been unearthed than it will be put back in its box: Alastair Cook returns on Wednesday after serving his over-rate ban, and the selectors will be almost back to where they started, agonising over Alex Hales and trying to convince themselves that the captain really is the answer.

The problem England have is that the retention of Cook is not completely devoid of logic. In 66 one-day internationals as captain, he averages nearly 40, with a strike-rate of 80; his win/loss ratio of 1.25 is better than England’s overall 1.02.

To point this out is not to be part of some conspiratorial nexus between the ECB and the press.

But an average of 40 and a strike-rate of 80 are reasonable figures only when compared to the England one-day captains and openers who came before him; England’s fans want them to keep pace with a changing game.

And that ratio of five victories for every four defeats will not win you a World Cup – let alone get you beyond the quarter-finals.

The ECB top brass think it is too late to change, while promising to change should England flop in Australia and New Zealand. They admired the resilience Cook showed during the Test series against India, and think there is more chance of him repeating the trick with the one-day team than there is of new-look side lifting the trophy.

Again, there is logic here. You may not agree with it – and most do not. But the thought process is not quite the finger-crossing exercise some have discerned.

The problem – and it has held English cricket back at various stages over the years – is conservatism.

Yes, a late change of plan could end up backfiring. But the safety-first option – and that is what Cook, for all his qualities, represents – is less likely to take the rest of the world by surprise. On February 14 in Melbourne, Australia's opening bowlers would rather be faced with Cook than Hales. They know what they’ll be getting.

In fact, England should consider one or two of the so-called risks they have already taken this year. Critics said Gary Ballance should not have batted at No 3 in the Test side. They said Joe Root was being messed around. They weren’t convinced by Moeen Ali at the top of the one-day order.

The selectors can be bold. But when it comes to the captain, they lose their nerve.

One argument has been that Eoin Morgan has been in no sort of form to replace Cook as captain. Yet his 47-ball 62 on Sunday took his record as one-day leader to 427 runs at 71. The armband acted as an adrenaline shot.

An on-song Morgan will be central to England’s chances at the World Cup, and so far the evidence suggests he’s more likely to be singing sweetly if he’s captain.

This columnist wrote a few months ago that Cook should have quit one-day cricket after the Test win against India, put his feet up, and prepared for 17 Tests in nine months starting in April.

Instead, his own stubbornness (both a strength and a weakness) and the ECB’s fearfulness have recreated the mood that characterised the summer, when Cook’s leadership filled the back pages and blogs on an almost daily basis.

We keep hearing that conditions in Australia and New Zealand are different from those in Sri Lanka, as if a change of scene will automatically benefit England. Last time they played a one-day series in Australia, earlier this year, they lost 4-1. Anything else is just wishful thinking.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

England too clever by half

It made some kind of sense for England to omit James Tredwell from the third one-day international in Hambantota. The boundaries had been brought in, there was rain in the air, and England knew what he brought to the perennial party. Victory there meant the decision attracted little scrutiny.

But to leave him out of Sunday’s match in Colombo was too clever by half. England knew in advance that the Premadasa pitch would be slow and low, but were swayed by the desire to have another look at Ben Stokes, who was duly out for six and bowled two overs for 21.

The best way of preparing for the World Cup is to start winning a few matches. On a turning track, Tredwell is in England’s best team. Instead, they put the needs of a struggling all-rounder ahead of the best interests of the side. No wonder Eoin Morgan sounded nonplussed in the post-match press conference.

James Tredwell has been left to bowl in the nets by England - but the spinner deserves a place in the team

Michael Clarke, all-Australian hero

When Michael Clarke walked off the Adelaide Oval earlier on Tuesday, having retired hurt on 60 during the opening day of the delayed Test series against India because of his bad back, he was treated to a standing ovation.

One of the many touching aspects of Australia’s response to the death of Phil Hughes has been the way in which Clarke – previously regarded as a bit too metrosexual for some Australian tastes – seems finally to have been accepted, no questions asked. They probably shouldn’t have been asked in the first place.

Fred fed up with KP

Last week, you’ll be aware, Kevin Pietersen described Peter Moores on Twitter as a ‘woodpecker’. Moores’s incessant coaching style, implied KP, was to blame for Eoin Morgan’s recent struggles (this was before Morgan made 62 in 47 balls in Colombo).

If a journalist dares to criticise Pietersen, it is apparently because he or she has got an axe to grind. So let’s hand over to Andrew Flintoff. ‘I like Kevin,’ said Flintoff on his podcast. ‘But he just has to let it go. Just move on.

‘We know you don’t like Peter Moores, we know you got sacked and we know you don’t play for England any more. But it must be exhausting sat in front of the television hating everyone.’ Quite.
