With their muscular thighs, hairy bodies and large feet, getting comfortable in their partner's tiny outfits can't have been an easy task for Jon Uriarte's subjects.

But nine brave men persevered for the Spanish photographer's latest project, The Men Under The Influence, which took him three years to complete.

While he originally took photos of the couples together wearing each other's clothes, Uriarte later realised that the men were more striking alone.

In multicoloured pumps and a playsuit, Jose wears his girlfriend Ainara's outfit for Uriarte's series

Steve wears his partner Fonlin's summer babydoll dress and spangly sandals

'The Men Under The Influence addresses the recent change in roles in heterosexual relationships from those of our predecessors and how changes have affected men in particular,' Uriarte says of his project.

'The photos attempt to capture the men's loss reference now that women have taken a step forward and have finally come into their own as equal partners.

'The project consists of full-length portraits of men wearing the clothes of their girlfriends or wives, taken in the space shared by the couple.'
