Soldier: A new investigation has finally been launched into the death of Private Cheryl James, 18

The family of a teenage soldier who mysteriously died at the notorious Deepcut barracks 19 years ago have asked for her body to be exhumed for a new inquest into her death.

Private Cheryl James, 18, was one of four young recruits who suddenly died in unexplained fatal shootings at the scandal-hit Surrey base between 1995 and 2002.

It is hoped the new investigation into her death could finally shed some light on the long-running mystery of the Deepcut deaths which has spanned over two decades.

The shootings, which were treated as suicide, sparked accusations of bullying and an army cover-up and led to a campaign spearheaded by the Mail to uncover the truth.

Today a new investigation was finally launched into the death of Pte James.

Lawyers for her family told a judge presiding over a pre-inquest review hearing that it was essential that her body should be exhumed and re-examined by a pathologist.

Alison Foster QC said the body could yield new ballistics evidence that would be central to finding out how the teenager came to suffer a fatal shot to the head.

Pte James, of North Wales was found on November 27, 1995, with a single shot to the head between her right eye and the bridge of her nose after she had been on sentry duty.

Just months earlier, in June 1995, Private Sean Benton, 20, of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with five bullet wounds to his chest.

Over the next few years, two more young recruits would die from gunshot wounds in the barracks.

In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London was discovered with two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty.

The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide.

The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death.

The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area.

Private James Collinson

The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. No inquest is held. 

The following year, on March 23, Private James Collinson, 17, was found dead with a gunshot wound through his chin while on guard duty.

The families of the tragic soldiers have refused to accept their children committed suicide and hired a ballistics expert who claimed in 2003 that it was unlikely that any of the soldiers had shot themselves.

A new two-month long inquest will now be held into Pte James’ death after the High Court quashed the ‘open verdict’ delivered at her original 1995 inquest.

Two judges ruled that the initial inquest, which was held three weeks after her death and lasted less than an hour long, had been insufficient.

The soldier’s parents Des and Doreen James have long refused to accept that their daughter committed suicide using her own rifle.

Represented by Liberty, the family finally saw a new inquest ordered after taking new evidence to the High Court in July.

Today, the investigation finally got under way in Woking, Surrey, with Judge Brian Barker opening proceedings at the town’s civic offices with a ‘few moments of reflection’.

It will be up to Judge Barker, the Recorder of London, to set the parameters for the upcoming inquest and to decide whether to exhume Pte James’s body.

Mrs Foster also suggested that the judge should make a site visit to Deepcut, to assess the distances involved on the Army site for himself.

A second hearing will be held in February to review progress on the disclosure of sensitive documents from the police and MoD.

Retired company director Mr James, 65, from Carreghofa on the Shropshire-Montgomeryshire border, said he was happy to see the investigation was finally on its way today.

Speaking after the short hearing, he said that the pre-inquest review had come just days after the 19th anniversary of his daughter’s death.

‘It’s coincidental and ironic that finally we are on the journey. It’s a lovely feeling,’ he added tearfully.

Before the hearing today, Mr James said he was not looking for revenge, just answers, after his experience of his daughter’s first inquest.

‘So many questions were left unanswered that day,’ he said. ‘To me, and many others, it was all a charade.

‘The powers-that-be, the police and military, seemed to want everything swept under the carpet and showed no interest in unearthing the truth about what really happened.

‘I just need to know what happened to her, for all the facts to be properly analysed. Cheryl deserves nothing less.’

The new inquest is expected to be held sometime after Easter next year following two more pre-inquest reviews.
