A pensioner who thought the couple next door’s garden was not tidy enough threatened to burn down their house, a court heard.

John Bushell, 89, whose own garden is his pride and joy, has subjected neighbours to abuse for decades, claiming their inferior properties devalue his.

The retired bookkeeper and neighbour from hell has already had five convictions over his anti-social behaviour and spent time in prison in 2001. This week he was back in court for breaching a restraining order for the tenth time. 

John Bushell has appeared in court for breaking a restraining order for the 10th time against his neighbours, who he has harassed and abused for four decades because he believes they do not maintain their gardens

The targets of his tirade were retired furniture maker Kenneth Mills and his wife Marjorie, both 69, who say they have been abused on numerous occasions since moving beside Bushell in 1970. 

In 2012, a court heard how Bushell accused them of living in a ‘midden’, a 14th century word for a manure dump, and called them ‘scumbags’.

In the latest incident, Mr Mills was in his garden with another neighbour when Bushell could be heard shouting: ‘I’m going to get shot of you, burn your house down before I die.’

On Monday he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court where district judge Helen Cousins said: ‘Your garden looks very beautiful but you can’t behave as you did.’ She sentenced him to an eight-week custodial sentence suspended for two years and urged him to move.

Yesterday Mr and Mrs Mills described how their lives had been made a misery by living beside Bushell.

They have tried repeatedly to put their house on the market but said potential buyers have always been scared off after learning about Bushell’s behaviour. Bushell claims he cannot sell his house because of the state of neighbouring gardens.

Mr and Mrs Mills said they were first abused shortly after moving to their home in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, while Bushell was first issued with a restraining order in 1998.

In court Bushell’s defence claimed his latest verbal onslaught was an ‘empty threat’ which the pensioner had no intention of carrying out.

Charlton Carr told the hearing: ‘He is a very house-proud man who likes everything in its place. Unfortunately he hasn’t got on with his neighbours over a period of time because he feels they don’t appear to look after their properties in the same manner.’

He said the offence was the result of frustration because potential buyers see that neighbouring houses are not as nice, which Bushell believes lowers the value of his property. After the case Bushell, who lives with his wife, said: ‘I’ve taken the house off the market.

Ken and Marjorie Mills claim they have been harassed by their neighbour for around four decades 

Bushell's home in the summer shows a garden full of flowers, which he believes is of higher standard

‘Who is going to buy it when you see the state of the gardens around here? I don’t drink or smoke, I just want a quiet life looking after my garden.’

Mr Mills yesterday denied there was any problem with the exterior of his house and said Bushell was using it as an excuse to justify his abuse.

The grandfather added: ‘He has got a lovely garden and looks after his place, but there is nothing wrong with our garden. It is neat and tidy. 

‘There were occasions when it has got so bad we have thought ‘‘we have to move’’ and that’s why we have put the house up for sale. But it’s a bit late in the day for us to move.

Bushell claims he has been unable to sell his £200,000 home because residents do not keep up standards 

Mr and Mrs Mills said Bushell threatened to burn down their home because he doesn't like their garden 

‘He goes to court and goes quiet for a time but then you can see him winding up and getting more angry and he does it again.

‘My wife was affected by it a few years ago. She had panic attacks and took medication for her nerves.

‘Twenty years ago it did affect me. He used to be very frightening and I never used to enjoy coming home from work, thinking that he would be at the gate.’

Bushell has said other properties in the street are not of the correct standard and devalue his property 

1960- John Bushell moved into detached property in Hebburn and disputes with neighbours begin. They claim he painted a whitewashed wall black and tipped rubbish into their gardens. 

1963 - Ken and Marjorie Mills moved into the house next door.

1998 - Bushell issued with an indefinite restraining order to stop him harassing the couple, following an expletive-laden row with them over the garden fence. 

2001 - Jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for three months after admitting three charges of harassment against the Mills' and breaching the order. Judge Michael Cartlidge sees secret video made by neighbours, and told him: 'We all love our homes but this is hopeless. This is not someone with a short fuse. It is someone with no fuse at all.'

2005 - Breached restraining order again after he nailed a plank of wood to their driveway wall. 

2006 - Bushell admitted breaching the restraining order twice and threatening to cause criminal damage. He was given a three year conditional discharge and fined £150.

2011 -Sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for nine months, after he breached a restraining order by climbing up on a garage and shouting abuse at the couple. 

2012- In court again after calling his neighbours 'scumbags' in another breach of the restraining order.  Given a conditional discharge. 

2013 - Prison sentence of two months, suspended for a year, for wasting police time after he pulled down his own guttering and blamed his neighbours for the damage. 

2015 - Sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for two years, after threatening to burn his neighbours' house down over the state of their garden.
