A bride-to-be was thrilled when her best friends gave her an early wedding present - a giant billboard advertising her hen party.

Sarah Molland, 25, was on a pubcrawl with friends when she came face-to-face with the huge roadside poster.

Her pals had clubbed together to organise the £500 billboard in Cardiff city centre.

Ms Molland's friends organised the billboard ahead of her hen do in Cardiff city centre and is a reference to the Russel Brand film Forgetting Sarah Marshall

Ms Molland said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes - I knew I would be getting plastered on my hen night but not like that.

'My first thought was: "I’ll kill them” - but I was delighted really. It was very funny.'

The 24ft X 12ft billboard is based on the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall starring Russell Brand, Mila Kunis, Jason Segel and Kristen Bell.

Ms Molland's best friend and maid of honour Rachael Coombs, 25, spent months plotting to put the poster up for the hen night for 15 girls in the Welsh capital.

Friends: All of Sarah's mates chipped in for the bill board, which has been seen by hundreds of people in Cardiff city centre

All the friends were sworn to secrecy so Sarah had no idea about the poster until she saw it on her big night out.

Ms Molland, of Birmingham, said: 'It was a night to remember - I enjoyed being a poster girl but it was weird seeing my picture that huge.'

The poster has been seen by hundreds of shoppers and motorists.

Criminology graduate Sarah studied at Cardiff University and returned to the city for her hen night.

She is marrying businessman Paul Jones, 26, in Birmingham next month.
