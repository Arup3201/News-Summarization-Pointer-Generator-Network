Steven Gerrard says it is ‘nonsense’ that his old Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez is not on the short list for world footballer of the year.

Oh well, only one of the three occasions on which the Vampire In The Box has bitten an opponent actually took place during the World Cup finals, which are the ultimate showpiece of the global game.

So what’s all the fuss about?

Steven Gerrard 'can't believe' that former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez isn't on the Ballon d'Or shortlist 

Suarez was on fire for Liverpool last term, but hit controversy again in the summer 

Suarez's year took a significant turn for the worse when he opted to bite Giorgio Chiellini in July

Rio Ferdinand is bewildered at being banned and fined for tweeting the word ‘sket’ to imply that the mother of one of his critics on social media is a ‘promiscuous woman,’ by dictionary definition.

Oh come on, he only told someone who questioned his abilities as a centre half to ‘get ya mum in, plays the field well.’

So since his QPR manager Harry Redknapp is at pains to assure us he’s ‘a top-class person,’ who’s to take offence?

Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA

Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket'

And to think I’ve always argued that the football authorities would be better advised electing their presidents, chairmen, chief executives and board members from among our leading players.

Time for a rethink.

Both these men have captained England. Both are being canvassed for high office when they come to the end of their playing careers, which is fairly imminent.

Ferdinand is actually campaigning to become Britain’s representative at FIFA and is already a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s eccentric commission which is supposed to be researching ways of improving our national game.

Heaven help us.

Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter

Gerrard and Ferdinand have been outstanding players, for Liverpool and Manchester United respectively. Each has given sterling service to England.

But one can’t see the obvious, that Suarez has forfeited his place on the Ballon d’Or list alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Javier Mascherano.

The other doesn’t grasp that smearing the morals of a mother he has never met is as obscene as the racist slurs to which he himself has been so vilely subjected.

Ferdinand comes across as a natural successor to UEFA president Michel Platini

So we are left with little or no option but to conclude that most of their brains are in their boots.

Stevie G is said to be still considering his future. Judging by his latest interview… careful.

Rio might switch his ambitions to UEFA. During his deconstructed ramblings on Jonathan Ross this week he came across as the natural successor to Michel Platini, who is forever busy proving that even all-time world class footballers do not make presidents.

Seems there really is only one Franz Beckenbauer.

Gerrard should know that Suarez forfeited his place in the Ballon d'Or shortlist because of the bite
