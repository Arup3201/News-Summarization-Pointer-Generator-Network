Detectives have started a murder investigation after the bodies of two women were discovered at an address in South Yorkshire.

A cordoned off area on Sandygate remains closed this afternoon while inquiries continue at the scene.

A local man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is assisting police with inquiries.

Neighbours of the detached bungalow 
said that the a pensioner who lived at the house with his wifeÂ  and 
daughter was suffering from cancer.

One man, who did not wish to be named, said that he spoke to his neighbour last Thursday.

He said: 'I've spoken to him over the
garden fence before but for the first time last Thursday he walked up 
the path to my house and told me if I saw any strange faces chopping the
hedges not to worry because he had asked them to do it.

'He told me he had cancer which had spread to his bones, and that he was having chemotherapy.

'I told him I was sorry to hear that and we didn't say much more than that. That was the last time I saw him.

'They've been in the house at least 25 years.

'I would say "hi" to them now and again when we saw them in the garden but didn't really know them.'

Other neighbours told how the couple kept to themselves and had only one child.

The daughter, described as in her 30s and with ginger hair, would be seen walking to a nearby bus stop daily on her way to work.

Another neighbour, Doug Stinson, 69, 
said the police had been to his house to ask if he knew the family - and
assured him there was 'nothing to worry about'.

Police and paramedics arrived at the scene at around tea time on Monday evening, neighbours told.

Post mortems on the women's bodies are
expected to take place later to establish the cause of death but no 
further details have been released.

Anyone with information should phone 
South Yorkshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 1035 of Monday, 22
