Steve Bruce has led a furious backlash against Gary Cahill after the defender escaped punishment for a ‘Swan Lake’ dive in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Hull.

The England defender was already carrying a yellow card after a bad foul on Sone Aluko and then, with the score at 1-0 to Chelsea, took an embarrassing 53rd-minute tumble as he passed between David Meyler and Tom Huddlestone in the Hull area.

Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but he enraged Hull manager Bruce by opting against showing Cahill a second yellow.

Foy had already booked Willian for diving and later showed a yellow to Diego Costa for the same offence – leading Bruce to warn the Premier League that they need to clamp down on simulation.

His calls were echoed by pundits Garth Crooks and John Hartson, who said: ‘Diving is like a cancer which is spreading through football.’

Bruce said: ‘I’ve just been asked if Cahill should have gone, and the simple answer is yes, especially given the referee has booked two people for simulation or diving.

‘Oscar, Eden Hazard or Willian are running at pace, so the smallest connection can bring them over. (But) this is England’s centre-half. He could have been a red card for his first challenge on Aluko. That was reckless and dangerous.

‘You expect the referee to do his job.’

Bruce added: ‘Look at the replays and there’s no justification for it. He’s taken off thinking Meyler is going to challenge him, looking to win the penalty.

‘In Latin countries it’s applauded. But people enjoy the Premier League because of the honesty and integrity. We need to stop this simulation that has creeped in. That was not a hard decision.

‘When you see Hazard live, with his short centre of gravity, you can’t touch him. But today was Cahill. The referee was 10 yards away. Everybody in the ground saw it.

‘It’s like something out of Swan Lake. It’s that blatant, that obvious what he’s trying. And yet there’s some excuse they’ll find for it. Maybe we might not have been good enough to get something, but playing Chelsea with 10 men is a lot easier than playing against their 11.’

Hull’s Tom Huddlestone was sent off for a disgraceful and dangerous foul on Filipe Luis shortly after Cahill’s reprieve, with Bruce convinced the ‘frustration’ of Foy’s earlier decision had pushed his midfielder to act so rashly.

He added: ‘Tom Huddlestone, who is the most laidback person, is frustrated with the decisions and produced a horror challenge which deserves a red card.’

Jose Mourinho said: ‘I didn’t see it on television. (But) I don’t believe Cahill dived. And if you tell me I’m wrong because he did, then something happened. Or they blocked his run. Or they touched. Or he lost balance. But that big, honest guy, I don’t believe he dived in the opposition’s box.’

Referring to Willian, whose dive was far outside the box, Mourinho added: ‘Willian, if he wants to dive, doesn’t dive on the midfield line. He dives in the box.’

Former Tottenham striker Crooks said: ‘Steve Bruce is right with everything he says. Chris Foy bottled it today - Gary Cahill should have gone. Referee Chris Foy bottled it. What else would you call it?’ 

Ex-England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said it was up to players to tackle the scourge of diving.

He tweeted: 'Diving is getting silly. Players need to self police the game. The only way it will change. What is the point of the PFA if they can't get their players to have a code of conduct?'

Former Liverpool and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy called for players to be punished retrospectively after claiming Sunderland's Adam Johnson dived to win a penalty against West Ham on Saturday, while West Brom defender Sebastien Pocognoli was booked for an outrageous dive against Aston Villa.

Speaking on Match of the Day Murphy said: 'I still believe you can do it retrospectively if you have the right panel of people. You could have an ex-player, an ex-referee and an ex-manager who could then impose a ban. I tell you it would stop so quickly.'
