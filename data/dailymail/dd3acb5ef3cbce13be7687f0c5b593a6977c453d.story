Spectacular scenes launched the Annual Festival of Naha, in Okinawa, Japan this week when 27,000 locals turned out for the annual tug of war.

The opening event of the festival, which can be traced back to the 17th century, sees two men in traditional Ryukyuan costume take on the role of kings representing the east and west.

Standing at either side of the 43-ton rope, the kings have their backs to each other, and then perform a ritual sword display, which is accompanied by other martial arts displays along the length of the rope.
