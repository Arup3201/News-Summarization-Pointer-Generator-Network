British detectives investigating the Lockerbie bombing are to travel to Libya for the first time.

Under a deal sealed by David Cameron on his surprise visit to Tripoli yesterday, officers from the Dumfries and Galloway force in Scotland will travel to the Libyan capital next month.

The team of detectives hope to track down the masterminds behind Britain’s worst ever terrorist atrocity, in which 270 people died in 1988 after the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie.

Metropolitan Police detectives 
investigating the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher, who was gunned down 
outside Libya’s London embassy in 1984, were also given permission to 
make a fourth visit to the country later this month.

Mr Cameron, who defied security 
warnings to travel to Libya, told a press conference in Tripoli: ‘In all
of these cases I want to achieve justice and full uncovering of all the
facts.’

It is the first time Mr Cameron has been to Libya since his triumphant speech in September 2011 to mark the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi

Hailing the breakthrough as a 
dividend of the Arab Spring, he added: ‘It is unthinkable that they 
would ever have been allowed into the country to ask questions under 
Gaddafi.’

Former Libyan intelligence officer 
Abdelbaset al-Megrahi remains the only person ever convicted over the 
Lockerbie atrocity.

He died in May 2012, three years after being 
controversially released from a Scottish prison on compassionate 
grounds.

But several other Libyan figures are 
thought to have been involved in the attack, which turned Libya into a 
pariah state under Colonel Gaddafi.

Scottish detectives will now hold talks with the Libyan authorities on the scope of their inquiry.
A government source said: ‘They are very keen to come to Libya to talk to people and follow leads that they have.’

Mr Cameron insisted that despite the upsurge in violence in Libya, the 
Arab Spring was ‘still part of the solution, not the problem’.

He said the lesson of past efforts to cosy up to brutal dictators in the
Middle East was that it ‘stores up problems for the future’.

Weapons from Libya are thought to have been involved in the Algerian gas
plant massacre last month in which six Britons died.

Acknowledging 
problems in the region, Mr Cameron said: ‘Of course, when a brutal 
dictator is removed after 40 years, inevitably you take the lid off all 
sorts of problems and tensions.’

But, announcing new co-operation on security, he said a stable Libya would benefit the world.

He said: ‘We’re much better off in Britain with a democratic Libya but 
we’ll only be truly better off when it’s a secure and democratic Libya.’

Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan backed the investigation into 
Lockerbie, saying it was important to ‘know the facts’ about the Gaddafi
regime’s crimes. Mr Zeidan said he was willing to discuss further 
measures to achieve ‘truth and justice’.

He hailed Mr Cameron’s ‘courageous’ decision to come at a time when 
observers fear Libya is in danger of becoming a crucible for militants 
across the Sahara region.

Earlier, Mr Cameron had toured a police training centre on the outskirts of Tripoli.

He told police recruits it was ‘very good to be back’. ‘I will never 
forget the scenes I saw in Tripoli and Benghazi,’ he said, referring to 
his visit to Libya in 2011 after the toppling of Gaddafi.

‘The British people want to stand with you and help you deliver the greater security that Libya needs.

‘In building a free and secure Libya you will have no greater ally than the UK. We will stick with you every step of the way.’
