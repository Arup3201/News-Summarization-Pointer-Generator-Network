At the PFA’s annual ceremony in April 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson was invited on to the stage with the Class of 92 to collect a special merit award.

With a room full of several hundred people slapping him on the back as he made his way up to the receive the award, it would have been very easy for him to take all the glory.

Instead, as Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes looked on, Ferguson spoke about the men who really did discover the group of players who trialled each night at Albert Park in Salford in the late Eighties.

Sir Alex Ferguson recognised the work of Eric Harrison (left), who brought through the Class of 92, when the then-Manchester United manager and his youth coach received merit awards at the PFA bash in 2013

‘We decided to invest in youth and Eric Harrison was a master,’ admitted Ferguson. ‘Everyone worked so hard.

‘I brought in Les Kershaw, we coached, we trialled every night every week, and the trialling was producing unbelievable players.’

It was one of those nights when most people in the room were simply happy to be in the company of the United manager. He could easily have edited the story.

Instead, his speech was humble and well-meaning as he referenced the men who helped to make it all happen for Manchester United.

Credit, where credit is due, and good on him for that.

The modern trend is very different, with the scouts and development coaches who signed, recommended or brought through some of these young players scandalously overlooked in the final analysis.

Raheem Sterling blazed a trail for young players at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers' management

Mel Johnson is one of hundreds of scouts who hammer it up and down motorways each week to act on tip-offs to watch young players.

This guy should be chair-lifted into Anfield at every home game and given the best seat in the house for the discovery of Jordon Ibe and Sheyi Ojo.

Johnson flagged both to Liverpool when he arrived at the club shortly after the appointment of Damien Comolli as technical director in 2010.

Stuart Webber, another former Liverpool scout also played a significant role in the recruitment of Ojo from MK Dons, along with Jerome Sinclair, who is scoring goals for fun in the Development league, from West Brom. 

Ibe was first spotted by Johnson when he worked in the south of England, where he was employed as chief scout for the former QPR manager Ian Holloway.

A few years later, when Comolli took Johnson to Liverpool as one of his primary scouts, they made their move because the club had moved towards a different recruitment strategy under Fenway Sports Group.

Liverpool offered Wycombe £750,000 for Ibe; Tottenham offered £75,000, or thereabouts.

Ibe is attracting a lot of attention at the moment, particularly after another eye-catching performance for Liverpool during their 2-0 victory at Southampton on Sunday.

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher and former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry reflected on his ‘amazing performance' during their analysis for Sky Sports on Sunday.

Ibe made his debut in May 2013, picked by Rodgers for a 1-0 victory over QPR at Anfield before he went on loan to Birmingham and Derby County. In nine appearances he has never lost in a Liverpool shirt.

No-one deserves more credit than the player himself for his development, but others have played their part in his progress.

Sometimes they deserve a pat on the back, too.

Kenny Dalglish was short of numbers for a six-a-side game at Melwood when he fetched Ibe over to play with the senior players for the first time in 2012.

Ibe showed no anxiety, announcing himself to a group of players that included Luis Suarez by scoring in the top corner, first with his left foot and then with his right.

When Suarez asked how old he was, the Uruguay forward refused to believe that Ibe was only 16. ‘At least 18,’ was Suarez’s response.

Nobody knew too much about this kid from the Liverpool academy and nobody was quite sure where he had come from.

In the mists of time, along with the constant shuffling and sacking of staff (Johnson was fired by Liverpool in November 2014), it is easy to forget the men who made it all possible.

Frank McParland, who was the club’s academy director, and Comolli have left Anfield. Stuff happens, people fall out of favour, they may well accept that.

Their legacy, though, is hugely talented, young English players, who are being given the opportunity to thrive under Brendan Rodgers.

Ibe has forced his way into the first team after returning from a successful loan spell at Pride Park.

The huge turnover of staff at the top Premier League clubs means that it would very easy to forget Ibe’s journey from Wycombe Wanderers, where he made a handful of appearances, to first-team player at Liverpool.

‘You don’t want to miss out on a 17-year-old at Brentford, so you go to watch,’ admitted Johnson in a recent interview.

‘You have to go to games, you have to go with your gut instincts.’

When it comes to his work at Liverpool, guys like Johnson deserve a special merit award.
