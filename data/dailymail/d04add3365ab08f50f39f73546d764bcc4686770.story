Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is leading calls for the terminally ill to be able to end their own lives

Eighty prominent public figures today call for the legalisation of assisted dying, warning that one Briton travels abroad each fortnight to end their own life.

Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, author Ian McEwan, actress Zoe Wanamaker and a number of doctors tell political leaders that refusal to debate the issue in Parliament is ‘heartless’.

They have signed a letter saying that all parties must commit to completing a process that would allow terminally ill people to take their own lives.

The call for action follows the tabling of a bill by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor.

This would permit doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses to patients who had no more than six months to live and had a ‘clear and settled intention’ to end their lives.

Under current law, helping someone to take their own life could carry a jail sentence of up to 14 years.

David Cameron has previously said that he would oppose plans to legalise assisted dying. If the issue is debated in Parliament, MPs will be given a free vote. 

Those leading the call for change include Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, who suffers from motor neurone disease.

Sir Chris has previously told of how he considered starving himself to death following a diagnosis of cancer. 

In an interview with Sky News he said: ‘I mean one option that I considered this winter, when I was diagnosed with cancer and kidney stones in addition to the motor neurone disease which I already had, was to starve and dehydrate myself to death.’

Other signatories include author Julian Barnes, and philosopher AC Grayling.

Hugh Grant, Sir Patrick Stewart, Jo Brand, Zoe Wanamaker and Eric Idle from the world of showbusiness have also backed the campaign.

The letter to the Daily Telegraph reads: ‘If there is not enough time for the (Lord Falconer’s) Bill to complete its stages before the general election then it is imperative that Parliament continues this important debate afterwards.

‘Currently, one Briton a fortnight is travelling to Dignitas. For each person who travels abroad, ten terminally ill people are taking their own lives in this country.

‘The overwhelming majority of the public supports law change on assisted dying and no one believes that someone should face a prison sentence of 14 years for compassionately assisting a loved one to die.’ 

Comedians Eric Idle and Jo Brand have also signed the letter calling for a change in the law

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the campaign group Dignity in Dying, said she was now sure that the law would be changed.

She said: ‘We are fast approaching tipping point on the issue of assisted dying. It is now a question of how, not if, we change the law.

‘This letter has been signed by people across the political spectrum and from all areas of society, including those who have been directly affected by our cruel and outdated law. It is clear we can no longer let dying people suffer against their wishes and the next government has the opportunity to change this.’

The letter comes after an 86-year-old widow starved herself to death – an act she considered the only legal way to exercise her right to die. 

Jean Davies, a long-term right-to-die campaigner, had a range of health problems but was not terminally ill.

She began refusing food on August 28 and died on October 1. The former maths teacher’s daughter, Bronwen, said at the time: ‘I was very angry when my mother first told me of her decision.

‘However, I recognised that this wasn’t about me. All the family did. We are all respectful of the fact that it was her life and her choice.’

Miss Davies added: ‘My mother was a fiercely independent lady who had the capacity to make this decision.’
