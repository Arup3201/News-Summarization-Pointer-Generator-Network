David Cameron’s demands for changes to benefit rules for EU migrants were last night dismissed by a senior Brussels bureaucrat as a ‘very British’ issue.

Cecilia Malmstrom indicated the UK was isolated in Europe for wanting restrictions on access to welfare for new arrivals.

The EU home affairs commissioner also played up the lack of support across Europe for radical changes to rules allowing free movement of EU citizens. The overwhelming majority of member states say ‘do not touch’ them, she said.

Her comments, in a speech to the Chatham House think tank, are further evidence of the difficulties Mr Cameron faces in trying to secure fundamental reform.

The PM has made clear his determination to renegotiate key elements of Britain’s relationship with the EU ahead of the proposed referendum in 2017.

But Miss Malmstrom said there was a deep reluctance among member states to renegotiate.

And asked if the EU should listen to the public, she said it would be wrong act because of the growth of ‘racist parties’.

Without naming any in particular, she said: ‘Of course we should listen, but just because there is a growth in racist parties saying we should close our borders ... doesn’t mean the majority of us would want to vote for these parties in any country.’

Unemployed: The Commissioner also claimed she had demanded 'concrete' evidence of benefit tourism in the UK - but had received nothing from ministers.

Asked about fears in the UK about migrants’ access to benefits, Miss Malmstrom said: 'I tend to think this debate is very British.

'There are individuals in other countries, but overall, the sort of ‘social welfare tourism’ is very British. It’s not widespread in other countries.'
