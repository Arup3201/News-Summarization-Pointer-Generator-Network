The FIA are monitoring the progress of Typhoon Phanfone with Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix under threat from strong winds and heavy rainfall.

This weekend's race has been thrown into doubt with the typhoon making its way towards Japan from across the Pacific.

Suzuka however, looks like swerving the worst of the weather caused by the typhoon - with heavier winds and stronger rainfall not expected until after the chequered flag.

As things stand at the moment, the worst of the typhoon should still be out at sea by the time the lights go out on the track.

'If we focus on the main race day, the centre of the storm looks to be still offshore east of the south island of Japan,' a MeteoGroup forecaster said.

'The typhoon's track is to veer north-eastwards just before it makes landfall and track up the eastern coastline of Japan before heading towards Tokyo.

'It actually doesn't look to make landfall (just south of Tokyo) until well into Monday daytime - therefore the winds may not have too much of an effect at the time of the race.

'However, rain is expected, although the much heavier amounts don't look to hit the Suzuka circuit until later on Sunday and overnight into Monday, at this stage.'

Heavy rain was falling over the circuit in spells throughout Thursday, with the conditions set to remain in place for both of Friday's practice session.

The path of the typhoon could yet alter and, in the worst case scenario, see the race cancelled - with no room for manoeuvre due to the Russian Grand Prix scheduled for next weekend.

Indeed Sergio Perez fears the race could be cancelled if the worst of the weather, predicted to fall after the race, hits Suzuka over the weekend. 

‘Rain will come tomorrow,’ he said. ‘The hurricane might come. If it comes, probably we won't be able to race.’
