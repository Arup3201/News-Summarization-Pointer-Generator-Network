A man wearing a military uniform and pretended to be a decorated Canadian soldier at a Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa is now the subject of a police investigation.

When interviewed by reporters at the ceremony, Franck Gervais spoke of honouring those who had fought for the country's freedom while wearing a beret, military uniform and medals.

But when an eagle-eyed Warrant Officer viewed the footage, he realised something was not right.

Michael Womack, a Warrant Officer based in Wainwright, Alberta, told the National Post: 'I saw the interview and I was like, "Wait a second, I should know him because that's an RCP cap badge and a maroon beret."

'I didn't know him, so I said to my wife: "Something's not right here".'

And his suspicions have now lead to The Department of National Defence confirming that Mr Gervais is not a member of the Canadian Forces.

Mr Womack revealed there were a number of small but significant details which gave away his ruse.

Mr Gervais should not have been wearing a paratrooper's pathfinders badge, nor the exclusive advanced reconnaissance award.

Among other inconsistencies were that his beret was too small for his head and he should have been wearing a red sash. 

The revelation he was posing as a soldier on a day meant to honour those who fought and died for their country sparked outrage across Canada.

It has now led to a police investigation, announced yesterday, that will focus on whether he falsely impersonated a member of the Canadian Forces.

Yesterday CBC News spoke to Mr Gervais' wife, who said she and her husband felt trapped.

She told the broadcaster the couple had been receiving death threats and said she couldn't comment on why he was wearing the uniform at the ceremony.

Franck Gervais was pictured at the ceremony wearing an army dress uniform with sergeant's chevrons and the cap badge of the Royal Canadian Regiment.

To the everyday viewer, there was no indication that anything was amiss. However, a number of details in his presentation - mostly undetectable to civilians - gave away the charade.

1. Mr Gervais was wearing an airborne pathfinders torch and advanced reconnaissance award. These are given to members of an exclusive unit that secure drop zones, gather intelligence and carry out dangerous ambushes and reconnaissance behind enemy lines. The course to gain entry is extremely difficult to pass.

2. A real soldier would not be wearing a beret as tight fitting as Mr Gervais' was. He should also have been wearing a red sash, as all infantry senior NCOs are required to during official occasions.

3. Mr Gervais was wearing the Medal of Bravery. This is an extremely rare award handed out for heroic acts, with most recipients usually well known and celebrated publicly as having earned it.

4. Finally, as a general rule the Canadian Forces does not permit its members to grow beards during active service - let alone maintain and groom a Van Dyke.

An estimated 50,000 people lined the streets for the public ceremony where a man named Franck Gervais was later found to be impersonating a soldier

Thousands gathered for Remembrance Day ceremonies at Canada's war memorial on Tuesday, the same site where a soldier was shot dead three weeks ago in an attack on parliament.

The annual November 11 Remembrance Day honoring Canada's war dead took on increased significance this year after two soldiers were killed in separate attacks in October that police said were carried out by radical recent converts to Islam.

The crowd, an estimated 50,000, was bigger than usual at Ottawa's cenotaph and security was tight at the event attended by Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

The prime minister cut short a trip to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) bloc summit in China to participate in the ceremony.

In a statement, Harper said the recent attacks on the two soldiers 'who were targeted simply because they proudly wore this uniform, only strengthens Canada's resolve to keep fighting against those who would deny our liberties and freedoms.'

On October 22, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was standing an unarmed, ceremonial watch at the war memorial when he was shot by a man who then ran into the Parliament building, exchanging fire with security officers before he was killed.
