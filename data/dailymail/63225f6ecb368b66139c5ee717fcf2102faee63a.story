A boy of ten has been banned from meeting his friends and hanging around shops after terrorising a community with his older brother.

Alfie Hodgin, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was given a two-year anti-social behaviour order in a bid to prevent him from causing harassment, alarm or distress to the public.

The child was also ordered to leave shops and businesses when asked by staff and is also banned from associating with a group of friends in public.

Last month, his older brother, John, 14, was himself given a criminal anti-social behaviour order at the same magistrates court.

John Hodgin was accused of being part of a gang that threw missiles at vehicles and hurled abuse at vulnerable people.

Within the terms of his order, the 14-year-old was banned from associating with nine of his friends in public and ordered not to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

The brothers are believed to be part of a gang involved in a series of incidents in the north end of the town.

Birkenhead neighbourhood inspector Duncan Swan said Alfie Hodgin's ASBO had been imposed in a bid to curb his anti-social behaviour and protect the community.

He said he hoped it sent out a strong message that individuals whose behaviour affects the wider community would not be tolerated.

The ASBO was issued by district judge Michael Abelson during a hearing at Wirral magistrates' court on December 1.

It states that Alfie Hodgin must not:

- Cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person not of the same household, or shop employee or customer inside shop premises within the borough of Wirral;

- Remain in any shop, commercial or business premises when asked to leave by staff within the borough of Wirral;

- Associate in a public place or any place to which the public have access with a number of previous associates named by the court.

If Hodgin does not obey any part of this order, he will commit an offence and may be fined or sent to detention for up to five years.

Inspector Swan said: 'The public need to be aware of [Alfie] Hodgin's behaviour and the conditions that the court has imposed on him.

'The local community has been affected and people can now act as our eyes and ears to make sure that Hodgin lives by those conditions.

'If anyone witnesses him behaving in an anti-social manner, they are urged to pass that information on to the police.

'Breaching the conditions of an ASBO is a serious matter and I hope that this sends out a strong message that the courts and the police will not tolerate individuals whose behaviour affects the wider community.

'All the people who contributed to this application are pleased with the result, and the positive action taken by the court.'
