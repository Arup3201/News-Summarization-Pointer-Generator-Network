The former Libyan oil minister who 
defected last year during the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi died by drowning, initial autopsy results show.

Shukri Ghanem, 69, who was the country's 
prime minister between 2003 and 2006, was discovered fully clothed floating in the river Danube in Austria on Sunday morning.

Police spokesman, Roland Hahslinger, 
said there was no indication of violence on Mr Ghanem's body and no 
indications to suggest he had committed suicide.

Mr Ghanem, who was working as a consultant for a Vienna-based company was last seen by his daughter on Saturday evening in their apartment, according to reports.

When she woke and found him missing she called police who told her his body had been found 20 metres from the shore of the Danube, close to their apartment.

He Hahslinger said: ‘There is no suspicion at all of foul play at this stage. The corpse exhibited no signs of violence.

‘There would be 
no signs of violence if someone pushed him in, but it's also possible 
that he became ill and fell into the water.’

An Austrian foreign ministry official
said family members initially told the ministry that Mr Ghanem had
died of a heart attack, adding that their version appeared to be 
plausible.

Mr Ghanem had no personal identification other than a 
document that named the company he was working for, Mr Hahslinger said.

Initial report: An initial autopsy shows Mr Ghanem died from drowning. Police say it's feasible he could have become ill and fallen into the river

An employee of the company was subsequently contacted and identified 
him.

The former energy chief fled from Libya to Italy several months after opponents of Gaddafi had risen up against the Libyan leader last year.

At the time he told the Italian Ansa news service that he deserted for Italy ‘to fight for a democratic country'.

As chairman of the Libya state-owned 
National Oil Corporation (NOC) since 2006, he had helped to steer the 
country’s oil policy and held the high-profile job of representing Libya
at Opec meetings and regularly visited Vienna for meetings in that 
role.

He
was believed to have been living in Europe in exile since he left Libya
but was still closely associated with Gaddafi's rule by Libya's new 
leaders and had ruled out returning home.

Mr Hahslinger said Mr Ghanem 
apparently left his Vienna home in the early morning after spending 
Saturday evening at home.

Police
were alerted by a passer-by who saw his body floating near his home, 
close to the modernistic building housing United Nations agencies in the
Austrian capital.

Considered
a member of Gaddafi's inner circle until his defection, Mr Ghanem 
insisted that Libya bore no responsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan 
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.

He also repudiated Libyan responsibility in the 1984 shooting of WPC Yvonne Fletcher during a protest in front of his country's embassy - an incident that led to the severing of British-Libyan relations.

Mr Ghanem's efforts were supported by Saif al-Islam, the Gaddafi son associated with the reform wing.

At the same time, he was viewed with suspicion by the old guard opposed to change - and their opposition to him led to his ousting as prime minister and subsequent appointment as head of the state oil company and de-facto oil minister.

He was reinstated in those positions in 2009 just weeks after his resignation, a move reflecting the power struggle between reformists and nationalists in his oil-rich North African nation.

Mr Ghanem continued to live in Vienna after Gaddafi was ousted and later killed last year in the Nato-backed rebel campaign.
