A former Royal Marine and his girlfriend have been jailed after they were found with £1million of MDMA stashed in their hotel room for a planned drug deal after they befriended a pusher while on holiday in Ibiza.

As Leah Parkes, 28, and Charles Hendrie, 30, supped cocktails and partied on the Spanish island they struck up a friendship with drug pusher Adib Asfour and began working with him and selling drugs to clubbers.

The pair continued to be involved in the drugs scene when they returned to England and were caught carrying out a service station drug deal -using  the Holiday Inn Express just off the M6 motorway at Stafford as a base from which to deal £1million worth of MDMA.

Charles Hendrie and Leah Parkes have been jailed after they befriended a drug dealer while on holiday in Ibiza, and were involved in a £1million service station MDMA deal when they returned to the UK 

Parkes was jailed for seven years for her role in the £1million drug deal, planned for a month by the pair 

When police caught the couple they found they had suitcases stuffed with 36 packages of the ecstasy-like drug.

The globe trotting couple had previously been to a number of exotic locations including a sailing holiday in the Bahamas and a romantic trip to Paris.

Hendrie, from Greater Manchester, had toured Iraq and Afghanistan before working as a bodyguard to several pop stars and businessmen. 

He is believed to have become embroiled in the drugs scene, along with his Parkes - his girlfriend of two years - after they met Asfour in Ibiza.

All three have been jailed for a total of 27 years.  

Parkes and Hendrie had gone to Ibiza for a romantic holiday in July 2013. 

Pictures taken during their trip show them dancing and drinking in some of the island's most famous nightclubs as well as enjoying the sunshine on the beach and boats.

The pair became involved in the drug scene as they enjoyed their holiday on the party island, selling tickets to events as well as recreational drugs to clubbers they met.

Stafford Crown Court heard that they spent about a month planning a large MDMA drug deal when they returned to the UK. 

Then in November they hired a van and drove from Manchester with two empty suitcases to The Holiday Inn Express hotel in Acton Gate, Stafford, just off junction 13 of the M6.  Parkes booked the room and went to bed complaining of a headache.

Hendrie then travelled to a warehouse in Brownhills in the West Midlands, where he collected 34kg of MDMA before driving back to the poorly lit car park of the service station hotel.

The drugs were transferred into the two suitcases before they were wheeled into the room. Asfour then arrived at the hotel room empty handed before leaving ten minutes later with Parkes' shoulder bag, believed to contain three kilos of MDMA.

Hendrie and Parkes then left the hotel with a suitcase 

But they were stopped by police on the M6 southbound who found the suitcase was stuffed with 16 airtight packages of the ecstasy-style drug.

Mr Parkes used to be a Royal Marine and had served in Iraq and Afghanistan before working as a bodyguard to several pop stars. He was given a Royal Marines cake (right) to celebrate his 30th birthday.

The couple were arrested and a search of their room uncovered another suitcase containing 19 packages of MDMA. In total 34.8kg of MDMA with a street value of £1.05million was found by officers.

The next morning an email was sent to the hotel from someone claiming to be Parkes, saying she had left her bag in the room and someone would collect it.

Chloe Arrowsmith, 24, from London, came to collect the bag - not realising Parkes was already in custody. 

Arrowsmith, who was cleared of wrongdoing, was described by police as "a sacrificial lamb" who was used in a 'cleansing run' where drug dealers would have someone collect drugs to see if the police are watching them. Another man Mark Harrington, 28, of Salford was also cleared.

Parkes and Hendrie, both from Bury, Greater Manchester, and Asfour, of Wolverhampton denied a charge of conspiring to supply controlled class A drugs between October 1, 2013 and November 8, 2013.

Adib Asfour is said to have collected drugs from the couple's base at a service station of the M6 and dozens of packets of MDMA were found stuffed inside a suitcase where Hendrie and Parkes had based themselves 

Police found a suitcase stuffed with airtight packets of MDMA in a car the couple were found travelling in 

But the trio were found guilty by a jury after a trial at Stafford Crown Court in October last year.

Asfour and Hendrie were both jailed for 10 years while Parkes received a seven year sentence. 

Judge Michael Challinor said: 'Ibiza is a party island, drugs are readily available.

'People are more likely to do something there that they would never dream of doing in the UK.'

The jury of seven women and five men convicted Hendrie by an unanimous decision but Parkes and Asfour were found guilty by a majority verdict of 10 for and two against.

Hendrie and Parkes became part of a team that sold tickets to events and also sold recreational drugs 

The couple were pictured enjoying evenings at a number of clubs and bars across the Spanish party island 

Hendrie was jailed for 10 years and Parkes for seven years for conspiracy to supply controlled drugs 

The couple are said to have become embroiled in the drug scene and dealing when on holiday in July 2013

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Simon Bowden, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'Staffordshire Police will not tolerate drug misuse and we will take dealers, and their associates, off the streets.

'Although the defendants do not live in Staffordshire they used the area as a central meeting point to exchange, and deal, a large quantity of MDMA.

'Following information received, officers intercepted Hendrie and Parkes on the M6.

In a series of snaps posted online the pair are shown enjoying the sunshine and sea on the island 

Police found 34kg worth of MDMA that had been stashed by the couple at the Holiday Inn for the drug deal 

Parkes and Hendrie had been together for two years when they went on holiday and met drug dealer Asfour 

'Their arrest, and a detailed investigation, led to the arrest of three other people suspected of being involved in drug crime.

'We also stopped 34.8kg of MDMA, with a street value of £1.05m, from getting on to the streets.

'Together with our partners we will continue to take a tough stance on criminals involved in drugs and related criminal behaviour.'
