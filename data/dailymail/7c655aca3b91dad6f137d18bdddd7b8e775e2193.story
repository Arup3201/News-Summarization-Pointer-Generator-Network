Kate Moss controversially proclaimed that ‘nothing tastes as good as skinny feels’, and it would appear that her best friend Stella McCartney agrees.

Fashion designer Stella came under fire from fans yesterday after posting a picture on her Instagram page of an emaciated model in a vest from her brand’s Summer 2015 collection, alongside the caption: ‘Worn well!! X Stella.’

Hundreds took to the page to express their disapproval, with one writing: ‘Disgusting. That is not worn well, it’s hanging over bones.’ Another added: ‘Appalling image. This young lady is clearly very ill and the body image being used is all that is wrong with the fashion world.’

Furore: Fashion designer Stella McCartney came under fire from fans after posting this picture on her Instagram page of an emaciated model, alongside the caption: 'Worn well!! X Stella'

Some of her 1 million followers even began a campaign to ‘unfollow Stella’ on the picture-sharing site, resulting in the photograph being removed just hours after it was posted. It was replaced with one of British model Malaika Firth in the vest.

A percentage of sales from the garment is being donated to the Linda McCartney Centre at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, which specialises in cancer treatment and is named after Stella’s mother, who died of breast cancer in 1998.

The furore follows comments Stella  made at her Paris Fashion Week show on Monday, suggesting strong women are unattractive.

She drew criticism from feminists after she revealed her latest collection ‘was celebrating the softness of a woman, and her fragility. Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive at times’.

The 43-year-old daughter of Beatle Sir Paul McCartney has spoken out in the past about how she didn’t feel ‘welcome’ in the fashion industry when she was starting out.

‘There is this sense that you’re not good enough to really be part of this brand and maybe you’re not thin enough and maybe you’re not cool enough, and I picked up on that,’ she has said.
