Rapist: More than 145,000 have signed a petition opposing Ched Evans resuming his playing career

Signatures have flooded in on a petition calling for Ched Evans to be stopped from playing football for his former club following Judy Finnigan’s controversial comments about his conviction.

At the weekend the online campaign had attracted 90,000 supporters. But by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it.

The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to ‘refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player’.

It argues: ‘To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.’

However, the club’s manager Nigel Clough yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow – something many fans strongly support.

‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it,’ he told BBC Radio Sheffield.

Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012.

Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor said last week that Evans should be allowed to continue his career on his release.

But former Sports Minister Richard Caborn, a lifelong Sheffield United fan, told the Daily Mail that Evans should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal, adding: ‘People should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong.’

At the time, Evans was a 22-year-old Welsh international striker with Sheffield United. Great things had been predicted of him when he was playing in the youth ranks at Manchester City

Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted. 

Among material it makes public is CCTV footage showing the 19-year-old, her face obscured, arriving at the hotel shortly before the rape took place in May 2011.

It is accompanied by a commentary alleging that the footage clashes with her version of events – including her ability to walk in high-heeled shoes despite saying she had been too drunk to remember what happened.
