David Beckham shows off his culinary skills in a new advert for Sainsbury's in which he promotes the return of their Active Kids scheme.

MailOnline has been given an exclusive preview of the advert, which you can view below, before it is broadcast on ITV on Wednesday evening.

The 40 second clip shows a pupil making his way home from school whilst proudly protecting the contents of a cardboard box he's carrying.

Yes, chef: David Beckham helps children make a fruit smoothie

Once home, he reveals to his parents that a homemade vegetable quiche is inside which he made with 'the help of his friends'.

These friends are none other than David and paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds.

The pair are ambassadors for Sainsbury's voucher scheme that aims to encourage children to be more active and healthy.

Boost: Now supermarket vouchers can be swapped for cookery equipment for schools and clubs

David, 38, is seen helping children make smoothies and chop vegetables as they are taught of the benefits of healthy eating.

Previously, shoppers have collected Active Kids vouchers which they pass on to school, nurseries and clubs who can exchange them for sport experiences and equipment.

When the scheme relaunches on Wednesday, cookery and nutrition toolkits will also be available in exchange for vouchers.

The idea ties in with key changes to the national curriculum, as from September, all pupils between the ages of seven and 14 are to be taught cookery.

His parents think his cooking is delicious: Sainsbury's hope this scene will become reality as they relaunch the Active Kids scheme to include cookery equipment as the subject becomes part of the national curriculum

The supermarket brand hope to support this teaching by equipping school children with the materials, ingredients and knowledge they need via the voucher exchange.

Justin King, Sainsbury's CEO said: 'We are excited to be launching our 10th year of Active Kids – now with even more choice – we believe it will help prepare schools for curriculum changes in September. 

'The benefits Active Kids brings to tens of thousands of schools and clubs makes us very proud.  With the support of David Beckham and Ellie Simmonds, we know that in 2014 we can play a key part in helping young children understand cooking and healthy eating from a young age, as well as continuing to support local communities.'

In 2013, Sainsbury’s invested over £13m in schools, groups and clubs through the Active Kids scheme, bringing the total investment to £136 million since 2005. This year, the scheme is bigger than ever with a catalogue of equipment providing groups with cookery as well as sporting equipment to help children enjoy healthier lives.
