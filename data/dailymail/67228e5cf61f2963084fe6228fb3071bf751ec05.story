A hospital is planning to introduce a high-tech solution to the high demand for its services - by offering consultations via Skype.

NHS managers claim use of the free online video calling service could reduce outpatient appointments by 35 per cent.

If the plans at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire get the go-ahead, it is thought the hospital would become the first in Europe to use Skype in this way.

Bosses believe using Skype will not only ease demand on consultants’ time, but also free up car parking spaces on the site.

They say up to 180,000 patients a year could also benefit from the online consultations by contacting doctors from their office instead of taking time off work to visit the hospital.

One hospital in North Wales already uses Skype - but only so nurses can monitor how dialysis patients use their equipment at home.

The proposal is part of a range of schemes to ease pressure on the hospital, which is coping with higher-than-forecast increases in demand. They also include the possibility of doctors treating patients via email consultations.

Typical of cases which could be seen by Skype video conference would be people who have had routine surgery or other treatment and simply need a doctor to review final scans before formally discharging them. Anyone needing face-to face contact and physical examinations will still be called in to the hospital, situated in Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent.

Officials admit planning for the move is still at an early stage, but it has the potential to slash the annual 517,000 outpatient appointments by 35 per cent.

Chief executive Mark Hackett said: ‘Some patients take on technology better than others. But these methods could suit in particular the under-50s who now have to take time off work to get to appointments.

‘They would see it as a much more sensible way forward to avoid making trips to the hospital.’

The move has been welcomed by local health campaigners and business leaders - who said the plans would lessen the impact on the economy of patients taking time off work.

Ian Syme, co-ordinator of pressure group North Staffordshire Healthwatch, said: ‘So long as the patient is confident using the system it sounds superb. But with vastly growing numbers of silver surfers, it must not be restricted to the young.’

Jane Gratton, deputy chief executive of Staffordshire Chambers of Commerce, added: ‘I think employers would support this as well as their workers.

‘For people to spend 10 minutes talking to the doctor while at work instead of having to take the whole day off would help their company’s productivity.’

The £400million hospital - built under a private finance initiative - has seen Accident and Emergency admissions soar by 11 per cent over the winter, compared to a forecast growth of just seven per cent.

It also wants to help GPs by setting up ‘hot clinics’ where specialists can see patients with already-diagnosed conditions - and then send them straight back to their surgery without needing an admission to a ward. A further 50,000 patients-a-year could be seen by consultants running clinics in community settings.

Last March, Whittington Hospital in Archway, North London said it was considering the introduction of a similar system of video consultations. A spokesman yesterday said the proposals were still on the drawing board and had not yet been implemented.

In 2011, Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor, North Wales, introduced Skype monitoring of dialysis patients - allowing them to use the machines at home under observation by nurses, who were able to troubleshoot any problems with the aid of the software’s webcam link.

The following year, the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland (MDDUS) said in advice to doctors that Skype could reduce the number of missed GP appointments and pose a better alternative to telephone consultations, as the doctor is also able to visually assess the patient.
