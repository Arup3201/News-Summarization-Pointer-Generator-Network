A drink driver who crashed his sports car into the side of a house, narrowly missing a sleeping child, has been banned from the road for two years.

Lewis Richardson, 22, lost control of his red Audi TT while trying to find his girlfriend after an argument during a night out.

The salesman crashed through a hedge and fencing before his car ricocheted off the top of two parked cars and crashed through a house in Carlton Colville near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Drink driver Lewis Richardson, 22, lost control of his red Audi TT, crashed into the side of a house, narrowly missing a sleeping child

The car wedged in the living room wall and window of the home, suspended four feet above the ground and just below a bedroom where a five-year-old girl was sleeping.

Richardson of Pakefield near Lowestoft, suffered serious head injuries in the crash in March and had to be carefully cut from the wreckage by firefighters.

He was left fighting for life and was treated for several weeks in a specialist head injuries unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge.

Lowestoft magistrates heard how the university graduate still had limited movement and difficulties with his speech and vision and suffered from extreme anxiety, depression and guilt.

A blood test revealed he had 87 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of blood, just over the legal limit of 80 mgs.

Richardson admitted drink-driving and driving without due care and attention. As well as being banned, he was fined £650 and ordered to pay £125 costs.

Presiding magistrate Mike Cadman said Richardson’s ban was double what it should have been because of the 'consequences' of the crash.

The court heard how the car caused serious structural damage to the detached house and could only be removed by engineers after it had been embedded for eight hours.

The family of three in the house had to be moved into rented accommodation while repairs were made, said prosecutor Tess Mann.

She added that the daughter was so traumatised that she refused to sleep in a room on her own.

Debbie Reynolds, defending Richardson, described him as of previous good character and said he was 'extremely sorry' and had visited the family to apologise.

She said: 'If he could wind back the clock so it never happened he would.'

Ms Reynolds added in a statement after the hearing: 'He is truly sorry he made a mistake to drive on that evening.'

Keith Shales, 66, who lives near the crash scene, said: 'When I got there and saw the car through the hole in the hedge I thought ‘That looks serious’.

'I’ve seen photos of cars going into people’s houses before but from the pavement, through the bushes and the cars behind it - it was like a launch pad - it must have been for him to get that high.

Richardson’s parents, Graham and Ann, wrote to a local paper after the crash to praise 999 workers who saved his life.

The couple said: 'We would like to thank all the members of the emergency services who attended.

'We would also like to thank the A&E department at the James Paget University Hospital and Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge for saving our son’s life.

'We are also grateful to everyone who prayed for him and who sent their good wishes to him and our family.'
