Toby Alderweireld would like to make his loan move to Southampton permanent, despite reported interest from the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham.

The 26-year-old's September arrival from Atletico Madrid appeared quite the coup, especially as the season-long loan gave Saints the option to make the move permanent for just £6.8million.

Alderweireld's impressive performances have made that fee look all the more paltry, but parent club Atletico could cancel that buy-out clause by paying Saints £1.5million

That, along with growing interest in his services, muddies the water somewhat, but the Belgium international would be keen to stay at St Mary's.

'If I could choose then of course I would like to stay here,' Alderweireld, set to return against Chelsea after nine weeks out with a hamstring complaint, told the BBC.

'It's not up to me. Atletico could decide that they want me back. I have two years left there so it is difficult for me to answer the question.

'I'm enjoying the Premier League, I'm enjoying playing for Southampton - I love the club and I love the fans. I am enjoying it here and my mind and focus is on Southampton.'
