The Apprentice star Karren Brady has revealed the scale of her political ambitions, claiming Britain would not be in such a mess with more people like her in power.

The businesswoman and West Ham vie-chairman suggested the country’s never-ending economic woes could have been avoided with more successful business leaders in the government.

And she burnished her credentials as a future Conservative high-flier, taking a swipe at Lib Dem Vince Cable who has grumbled about her smash hit TV show.

Success: Karren Brady, West Ham United vice-chairman, called for more business people to go into politics

Ms Brady has long been tipped as a future MP – and even Tory leader – since she suggested she wanted to do her duty to the country.

In an interview published today she set out her alternative economic plan, with extra support for business and young people to find work.

‘I love politics. I love Britain. I want to get involved,’ she said.

But she rejected the idea of being parachuted into a safe Conservative seat, instead preferring to defeat a Lib Dem or Labour MP on the path to power.

‘I would never accept a safe seat. I would always want a difficult seat. Being fast–tracked is not something that appeals to me. ‘I do so want to contribute to making this a better place.’

Television: Ms Brady defended BBC1's The Apprentice, where she acts as an adviser to Lord Sugar (centre) against claims it was unrepresentative of business life

Earlier this month Business Secretary Mr Cable said he feared BBC1’s The Apprentice gives a ‘completely false impression’ of what real on the job training involves.

He dismissed Lord Sugar’s hunt for a business partner as ‘TV theatre’ which could deter young people from seeking a career in business.

But Ms Brady, who acts as a key observer and adviser Lord Sugar, dismissed the criticism with a thinly-veiled swipe at the Lib Dem Cabinet minister.

‘People who work recognise that The Apprentice shows the real pressure, the hard slog, the teamwork and how dogged you need to be to get things done,’ she told The Daily Telegraph.

‘Maybe people who are not working…or haven't worked for a while, won't recognise this.’

She suggested that the country’s sluggish growth and grim future prospects were in part because too many career politicians in the Westminster bubble have no experience of the cut and thrust of business.

‘You need people who are right at the cutting edge. I wish a lot more business people did get into politics. We'd be in a much better place now.’

Ms Brady backed David Cameron ahead of the 2010 general election for having ‘more empathy with the country and some of the issues that are facing us’ than Gordon Brown.

Since the coalition was formed she claims the government has done a lot to help new businesses, but they struggle to find the support available.

‘If it were me, I'd have one place to go – it would be like GoCompare. You'd type in what your business is, how much money you've got to invest, and what kind of help you need to get started.’

She also complained that the biggest barrier to women progressing in their career is the cost of childcare.
