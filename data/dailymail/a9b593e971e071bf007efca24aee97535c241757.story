Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is leaning towards a 'buy British-based' recruitment policy.

Despite a continental flavour to the club's current squad, underpinned by the £100million summer outlay spent on Paulinho, Christian Eriksen, Erik Lamela, Vlad Chiriches, Nacer Chadli, Etienne Capoue and Roberto Soldado, Sherwood is understood to be looking for players who have a better understanding of the Premier League.

Experience: Winston Reid (left) has been playing in England since signing for West Ham in 2010

He has warned that many of his squad are playing for their futures and much will depend whether he remains in charge himself.

He has held discussions with Daniel Levy this week regarding pre-season plans but results over the next few months could still be pivotal to how those plans are implemented. 

Former QPR scout Ian Broomfield has returned to the club after turning down an offer to join Arsenal and players such as James Milner at Manchester City and Winston Reid of West Ham United have been getting a mention as potential signings.

Catching the eye: Saints youngster Lloyd Isgrove (right) has plenty of admirers in the Premier League

Bolton manager Dougie Freedman and Manchester United coach Phil Neville were among interested spectators as Southampton ended Manchester City U21s winning streak.

An injury time goal from England U19 international Jack Stephens earned the visitors a 2-1 win on Monday night at the Etihad Stadium and ended City's 12-game winning run.

The rich seam of talent being mined 
by both clubs meant Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer, Chelsea scout Mick 
Doherty and Leeds United's Luke Dowling were also among the crowd to see
 Marcos Lopes put City in front from the spot only for Jordan Turnbull 
to equalise just before half-time.

Southampton
 manager Mauricio Pochettino, who is in talks over a new contract, 
travelled up to watch his youngsters with the likes of Harry Reed and 
Wales U21 international winger Lloyd Isgrove impressing him and the 
onlooking scouts who were weighing up potential loan signings or grander
 transfers.

Indeed, Isgrove is joining Darren Ferguson's Peterborough United on a one-month loan this week.

City's Belgian defender Jason Denayer and captain Lopes were among their more polished performers. 

Meanwhile,
 City have appointed Rodolfo Borrell, formerly of Liverpool and 
Barcelona's academies, to help implement their coaching theories across 
the different franchises in which they have invested in around the 
globe.

Al-Habsi who saved Leon Best's penalty, Wigan midfielder Ryan 
Tunnicliffe, who joined on loan from Fulham, plus talented midfielder 
Gary Gardner who is on loan at Wednesday from Aston Villa but didn't 
figure.

Interestingly, he 
also counts Manchester City midfielder Jack Rodwell among his clients. 
Rodwell, who turned 23 on Tuesday, is wanted by Wigan manager Uwe 
Rosler, among other Championship suitors, on loan.

The
 England international is desperate for game time and City may consider 
letting him leave now they are out of the Champions League.

Former club Everton remain keen to sign him on a permanent deal in the summer.
