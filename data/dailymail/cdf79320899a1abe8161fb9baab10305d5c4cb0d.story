A frantic mother pleaded with her ex-husband to release her step-daughter moments before he shot the child in the head in a planned revenge killing.

Ricky Blackwell, 55, from Chesnee, South Carolina was found guilty of murder after lured his ex-wife Angela Davis and her step-daughter, Heather Brooke Center, to come to his trailer for a swim on July 8, 2009.

Spartanburg County Court heard that Blackwell was angry because Ms Davis had left him 18 months earlier for the eight-year old's father, Bobby Center.

Ricky Blackwell (right) is facing the death penalty after being found guilty of murdering his ex-wife's step-daughter Heather Brooke Center (left) in South Carolina.

When the pair arrived, Blackwell grabbed the girl, Brooke, and put a .357 Magnum revolver to her head.

Ms Davis admitted she had bought the gun for Blackwell as a present during their 27-year marriage.

She said she pleaded with Blackwell to release her daughter and even offered herself in exchange.

She told the court she was screaming 'let her go Ricky, please it's me you want, take me,' according to a report by GoUpState.com

Ms Davis said her ex-husband replied: 'You've pushed this too far. You did this and you tell me what Bobby thinks of this.

'Then the gun went off and it went off again.'

In total, Blackwell shot the youngster four times at point-black range.

Blackwell's solicitor Bill McGuire asked the court to consider his client's mental state at the time of the murder.

He said his client should not be judged entirely on what happened during those six seconds.

Mr McGuire said Blackwell's ex-wife 'was the air that he breathed, the sun in his universe. But she didn't stay there. She left. She took up an adulterous affair with Bobby Center'.

Master Deputy Bill Meyer of Spartanburg County Sheriff's office said he arrived at the scene less than five minutes after shooting

He said he saw a small child lying face down between a trailer and an inflatable swimming pool. He said an eyewitness identified Blackwell as the shooter.

The jury took just 20 minutes to find Blackwell guilty of murder.

The court will decide whether Blackwell will face the death penalty later today.
