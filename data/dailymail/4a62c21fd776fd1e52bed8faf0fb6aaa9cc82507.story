Tension: A bizarre road-rage video has emerged of two men in suits fighting at an LA junctionÂ 

Jessica Breuer, who witnessed the fight  said that attorney Randalf Kincaid got out of his car first and hit the driver of a BMW.

'As I'm sitting there, suddenly the 
person in the car in front of me leaps out of his car, he runs over to 
the car in the other lane, and the guy opens his door, and the guy who 
had run out just starts hitting him, she told ABC 7.

The video, filmed on Breuer's cellphone, opens with the two men arguing by a white BMW.

Holding: He then jumps on Kincaid and wrestles him to the ground where the pair lie as Kincaid is kept in a headlock

Kincaid then punches the owner of the car in the face as a woman in the same car gets out nervously - it looks like she is calling the police on her cell phone.

As Kincaid goes back to his Volkswagen Beetle during a green light, the bloodied man follows him back to his open door.

He then jumps on the man and wrestles him to the ground where the pair grapple as Kincaid  is kept in a headlock.
