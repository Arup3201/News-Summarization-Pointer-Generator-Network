With the glorious Lake District at its heart, you’d expect the locals in Cumbria to be a pretty fit bunch.

However, the county has just waddled away with the title of England’s fattest.

Sixty-eight per cent of its residents are either overweight or obese – so fat that it threatens their health.

Map below shows the top 10 fattest areas of the country - rated by the % of people with a BMI of more than the 'healthy' maximum of 25

Not only that, but the Cumbrian 
district of Copeland has the fattest of the fat, with an astonishing 
75.9 per cent pushing the bathroom scales past tipping point.

The
 figures are contained in data, issued for the first time, which reveals
 the fattest and thinnest parts of England and the scale of the obesity 
crisis.

Overall, 63.8 per cent of adults in England are overweight or obese.

North East (68% are overweight or obese)

North West 66% 

West Midlands 65.7%

East Midlands 65.6%

Yorkshire and the Humber 65.4%

East of England 65.1%

South East 63.1%

South West 62.7%

London 57.3%

Chasing
 Copeland for the title of the worst area are Doncaster, on 74.4 per 
cent, and East Lindsey in Lincolnshire, on 73.8 per cent.

After
 Cumbria, the fattest counties are North Yorkshire and Staffordshire, 
both on 67.9 per cent.

The fattest region is the North-East, where 68 
per cent are overweight or obese, followed by the West Midlands at 65.7 
per cent.

The slimmest 
English residents live in the wealthy London borough of Kensington and 
Chelsea, where only 45.9 per cent are overweight or obese.

The London 
boroughs of Tower Hamlets (47.2 per cent) and Richmond upon Thames (47.6
 per cent) are close behind.

Obesity
 is measured using the body mass index (BMI) score which is calculated 
by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres 
squared.

Anything under 25 is fine. BMI of 25 to 29.9 is classified as 
overweight and clinical obesity is defined as 30 or greater.

Tam
 Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The figure of 64 per cent 
for the country is bad enough but when figures rise to around 80 per 
cent for some local areas one has to believe that the problem may be 
insurmountable.

The projection that 50 per cent of the country could be 
obese before 2050 could unfortunately come to pass unless really radical
 steps are taken now by central government to tackle the problem.’

Joseph
 Clift, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Put simply, too many 
people weigh too much. This should be a catalyst for action at a local 
and national level.’

Obesity
 costs the NHS £5.1billion a year, according to the National Audit 
Office. The total cost to the economy of being overweight or obese has 
been put at some £16billion in 2007, rising to £50billion a year by 2050
 if left unchecked.

Back in 
Cumbria, Copeland Borough Council’s Gillian Troughton said: ‘We 
recognise that obesity is a national problem, and one which affects 
Copeland.

‘One big example 
of how we are tackling it is that we are investing in protecting our 
leisure facilities at a time of Government cuts, and continuing to offer
 those in receipt of benefits discounted access to the range of 
facilities we provide, which will soon include a new gym facility.’
