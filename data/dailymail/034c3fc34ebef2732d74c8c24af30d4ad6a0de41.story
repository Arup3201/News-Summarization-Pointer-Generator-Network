Raul Meireles, once of Liverpool and Chelsea, sported a thick beard and Mohawk haircut a la Roberto de Niro in Taxi Driver.

The Portugal midfielder arrived in England in 2010 with a full head of hair but within weeks, he had shaved it all off.

The reason Meireles gave for taking drastic action was he had seen a picture of himself in a  paper and did not like how he looked.

You talkin' to him? Raul Meireles' hair is reminiscent of Robert De Niro's in Taxi Driver (right)

Thomas Muller's reaction to Pepe’s flick of the arm may have drawn fierce criticism but what of the reaction from the Germany bench when the red card was shown? Television cameras caught a number of Joachim Low’s assistants and players celebrating and punching the air when Pepe received his marching orders. Surely that crosses the boundaries of sporting behaviour?

Shkodran Mustafi may be one of the least heralded members of Germany’s squad but his name will be familiar to Everton supporters.

Everton signed him in the summer of 2009 as a player for the future but he only made one substitute appearance — in a  dead-rubber Europa League game against BATE Borisov — before he left in January 2012. He now plays for Sampdoria in Italy.

Goodison connection: Shkodran Mustafi, once of Everton, came on for Germany in the win over Portugal

Portugal
 should have known what would happen next. A collision with Germany at a
 major tournament inevitably spells doom and this was the fourth time in
 eight years they have lost to this particular foe, a run which started 
when they were beaten in the third place play-off at the World Cup in 
2006. Portugal’s last major win over Germany was at the European 
Championship in 2000.

Some curious decisions were made during David Moyes’ short reign as Manchester United manager but none puzzled more than the decision to hand winger Nani — who was almost sold a number of times by Sir Alex Ferguson — a new five-year contract.

Monday’s appearance for Portugal was Nani’s third in two weeks. He only played three times for United after Christmas.

More disappointment: Nani flopped again as Portugal were thrashed

It's baffling how Nani got a new five-year deal at Manchester United
