Jean-Claude Juncker laid out his vision for an increasingly federal Europe yesterday – but was heckled by Ukip members during his first speech as President of the European Commission.

The former Luxembourg prime minister – whose appointment was bitterly opposed by David Cameron – was yesterday confirmed as president by a comfortable majority in a secret ballot in the European Parliament after receiving the backing of the main parties.

Mr Juncker, 59, then wasted no time in demonstrating why Mr Cameron had invested so much political capital in trying to block him.

Clash: Nigel Farage (left) stood up and said that the new President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker (with headphones) has no mandate 

Struggling to be heard: Mr Juncker was heckled on several occasions by MEPs as he spoke on immigration and the euro, forcing Parliament President Martin Schultz to step in to call for order

In a 50-minute address, he hailed former EU president Jacques Delors – the architect of the euro – as his political ‘hero’.

Setting out the priorities for his five-year term in office, Mr Juncker set himself on a collision course with Mr Cameron over a string of key issues, including immigration, human rights, employment and trade.

Mr Juncker pledged to create a new commissioner with specific responsibility for the controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The individual will be ordered to sign the EU up to the European Convention of Human Rights – a move that would make it impossible for the UK to escape the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court without leaving the EU.

He also pledged to ‘defend’ the principle of free movement of workers within the EU, and said Brussels should do more to ‘promote labour mobility’. He said this should be matched by moves to introduce some form of European minimum wage.

Mr Juncker suggested he would also like to see the development of an EU Army. And he pledged to water down Mr Cameron’s dream of a £10billion free trade deal with the United States, saying he would ‘not sacrifice Europe’s safety, health, social and data protection standards or our cultural diversity on the altar of free trade’.

The new Commission president paid lip service to Britain’s demand for a looser relationship with the EU. In comments directed at the UK, he said: ‘My firm conviction is that we must move forward as a Union but not necessarily all at the same speed.

‘For some, their final destination may already have been reached. I always was and very much remain ready to listen to and help find solutions for the concerns of each and every member state.’ 

All smiles: UKIP leader Nigel Farage enjoys a joke with Juncker before going on to accuse the new commission president of 'being a key player in a process' that has treated democracy with contempt

Critical: Mr Farage praised Mr Juncker for being a 'political operator', but said he didn't 'believe a word' that the new president was opposed to a united states of Europe

But he was heckled by Ukip MEPs in the European parliament, with Nigel Farage saying he had no mandate.

The Ukip leader told Mr Juncker: ‘What is clear is you are going to carry on with the process of the centralisation of powers.

‘We are being asked to vote for the ultimate Brussels insider, somebody who has always operated with dark, backroom deals and stitch-ups.’

Some Tories also voiced concern at Mr Juncker’s appointment. Eurosceptic MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘The EU has been shaken by the crisis of monetary union.

‘The recent elections have seen unprecedented advances by Eurosceptic parties.

‘But the answer in Brussels is still, as it always is, “more Europe”.’

The EU assembly approved Mr Juncker by a vote of 422 to 250, with 47 abstentions and ten spoiled ballots.
