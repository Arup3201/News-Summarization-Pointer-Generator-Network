Two men in an inflatable canoe have had a very lucky escape after they reportedly survived a shark attack off the southwest coast of Western Australia.

The pair, aged 30 and 33, were paddling 100 metres offshore of Castle Rock, Dunsborough just after 5pm on Saturday when one of the men sitting at the rear of the boat was thrown forward when it's believed a shark bumped the canoe and punctured it.

A police media spokesperson said the canoe started to deflate on one side, before the two men were thrown into the water.

It's believed one of the men struck the shark (unknown species) with his paddle before it swam off and the pair continued to paddle back to shore

One of the men is believed to have struck the shark with a paddle before it took off.

'They got back in the partly submerged canoe and paddled back to shore,' said the spokesperson.

The men made it to shore uninjured.

Police and WA Fisheries are investigating the incident. 

Department of Fisheries officers are now urging water users to be extra cautious in the area between Bunker Bay and Quindalup.

Beaches have been closed at both Castle Rock and Meelup, and remain closed until Fisheries officers and City of Busselton rangers reassess the situation.

Department of Fisheries officers say the report was of a shark, species unknown, puncturing an inflatable canoe with two people on board.

A Department of Fisheries boat has been monitoring the area, and the Surf Life Saving WA Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter has also conducted a sweep of the area.

People at the beaches are being advised to keep informed of the latest detection and sighting information and report any shark sightings to water police. 

It was only just over a week ago a man lost a hand and part of his other arm in a shark attack in southern Western Australia.

Sean Pollard, 23, lost his left forearm and his other hand at the wrist in the attack at Kelpid's Beach at Wylie Bay and is now on the long road to recovery.

Mr Pollard is lucky to be alive after he was dragged from the water and given first aid by fellow beachgoers following the horrific attack.
