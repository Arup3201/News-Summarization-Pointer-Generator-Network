The U.S. military has chosen a new Boeing model to replace its current fleet of Air Force One
presidential aircrafts.

The new Air Force One planes will be  Boeing Co's commercial 747-8 airliner, replacing the old Boeing 747-200Bs.

The blue-and-white Air Force One has become a symbol for the President of the United States and has been the backdrop for many historic moments.

Air Force One: The new fleet of Boeing 747-8 airliners will replace the  old Boeing 747-200Bs

The Pentagon had considered the A380 made by European aerospace giant Airbus, but opted for home-grown talent.

'The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the
United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary
capabilities established to execute the presidential support
mission,' said Air Force Secretary Deborah James in a statement.

Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a
competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of
building presidential aircraft.

The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured
Boeing 747-200Bs. It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical
baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the
plane's planned 30-year life.

James said the Air Force One program would use proven
technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the
program affordable.

Ride of the leader: The Air Force One airplane has become a symbol for the U.S. Presidency

Most recently,  President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were photographed stepping out of  Air Force One upon arrival in New Delhi, India for their state visit this week

The president's plane has long been a symbol of American power and the setting for historic moments, including the somber 1963 ceremony when Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board -- hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

The plane is often portrayed in Hollywood films and inspired a 1997 thriller titled 'Air Force One' in which the US president, played by Harrison Ford, fought off hijackers.

Outfitted with secure communications equipment and other gear, Air Force One is designed to serve as a 'mobile command center' and served that role briefly after the attacks of September 11, 2001.

It also features a suite for the commander-in-chief that includes a large office, a conference room as well as a medical area that can function as an operating room.

The plane's galley can feed up to 100 people and there are additional quarters for senior aides, Secret Service agents and other staff.

Air Force One is technically the radio call sign adopted by any aircraft with the president on board but it has become identified with certain planes reserved for the president's air travel.
