The gray water-stained suit worn by Gene Kelly in Singin' In The Rain's iconic dance scene is on sale for $160,000 - after the owner paid just $10 for it.

The anonymous collector picked up the belted two piece woolen suit in the 1970s when studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold off a range of movie costumes.

Almost 40 years later and the suit is set to fetch a six-figure sum.

Snapped up a bargain: The anonymous collector picked up the suit for just £6.50 in 1970 when he saw Kelly's name on the label

Kelly donned the suit for the centrepiece of the 1952 comedy in which he famously splashed through puddles twirling an umbrella during a downpour.

And 60 years on the jacket still bears the marks of filming - the inside of it is covered in water stains from where Kelly was repeatedly drenched during takes.

Singin’ in the Rain follows Kelly’s character, actor Don Lockwood, in his attempts to move from silent films into ‘talkies’ before venturing into musicals.

The highlight is Kelly’s energetic solo performance of the movie’s title song, which took three days to film.

The suit was tailor-made for the 5ft 7 Kelly and was created by Oscar-winning costume designer Walter Plunkett, who also designed the clothes in Gone With The Wind.

Hollywood legend has it that the wool suit shrank during the three-days of filming in the rain.

Plunkett had a then-enormous costume budget for the film of $157,000 to create the period 1920s designs.

Also for sale is Kelly’s beige and 
navy outfit from the scene where Lockwood meets Cosmo Brown, played by 
co-star Donald O’Connor, on the set of a movie. It is expected to fetch $6,500.

Margaret Barrett, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'Singin’ in the Rain is one of the best and most loved musical movies ever made and this suit comes from its most famous scene.

'Incredibly the current owner picked it up from the famous MGM costume sale in 1970 for just $10.

'All the costumes were hanging on racks and as he was searching through them he noticed Gene Kelly’s nametag on the inside.

'Then he saw the inner lining was water stained and realised it had to be the jacket from Singin’ in the Rain.

'Also on the rack was another of Gene’s suits from the film which he had to pay $75 for.

'They now look like they’re going to have been a very good investment.

'The
 market will decide what the suits sell for but I would like to see the 
Singin’ in the Rain suit go for a six figure sum - it certainly deserves
 to.'

This beige and navy outfit which was also worn by Kelly in the film is being sold for $6,500 at auction

As well as starring in Singin’ in the Rain, Gene Kelly also choreographed and directed it.

The film was conceived as promotional vehicle for songs written by MGM’s Arthur Freed in the 1920s and 30s.

The theme song Singin’ in the Rain was first performed by Doris Eaton Travis in The Hollywood Music Box Revue in 1929.

It then appeared in the 1929 musical The Hollywood Revue, on Annette Hanshaw’s album Volume 6, in the 1932 film Speak Easy and by Judy Garland in Little Nellie Kelly in 1940.

Since Singin’ in the Rain it has been used in numerous films including Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest in 1959 and A Clockwork Orange in 1971.

It was also the subject of one of Morecambe and Wise’s most famous sketches.

The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, on December 6.
