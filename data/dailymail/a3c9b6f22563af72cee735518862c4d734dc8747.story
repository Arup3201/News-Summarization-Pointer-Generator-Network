It's an opportune time to be young, free and single - or deeply in love with your significant other - in the tiny Balinese village of Denpasar.

Every year, one day after Balinese Hindus celebrate the Nyepi Day of Silence, thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in a kissing ritual known as omed omedan.

Participants gather en masse in town centre to party and kiss, in an event that is believed to ensure good health and prosperity to all those taking part, as well as protecting the village from bad luck during the year ahead.

Every year thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in the kissing ritual - known as omed omedan - in Denpasar

The so-called kissing ritual happens one day after Balinese Hindus celebrate the Nyepi Day of Silence, marking the start of the new year

It's believed the ritual brings good health and prosperity to those taking part, as well as protecting the village from bad luck

And just in case participants get a little too amorous, village priests are on hand with buckets of water to dampen the passions of lustful couples in the usually conservative country.

The ritual - which translates into 'pull, pull' - is believed to have started around 100 years ago as way for village youths to mark the first day of the new year.

It's not clear when, or why, mass kissing became incorporated into the tradition.

Omed omedan traditionally involves unmarried villagers, aged 17 to 30, and begins with prayer before the kissing begins.

Whether is just a good excuse to find a date or not, the revellers in these images appear to be making the most of the celebrations.

According to a report by Indonesia Now, the tradition is said to originate from a fight between a male and female pig hundreds of years ago.

As one would expect, many relationships blossom from the event after two villagers lock lips for the first time.

A participant told Indonesia Now that many couples eventually get married after sharing a traditional kiss.
