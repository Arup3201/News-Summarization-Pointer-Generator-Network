Before getting married next week, there are a couple of things Andy Murray would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man.

The immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories — he is within one win of doing so after beating Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the Miami Open.

Murray can pass the mark on Tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant South African Kevin Anderson.

Should Murray survive that encounter, it is possible he could edge ahead of Rafael Nadal and move back up to No 3 in the world rankings, although that also depends on the performances of others here.

Going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him, however, and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game.

Since tennis went open in 1968 — the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit — only 45 men have clocked that many wins. Only eight who are currently active have managed it.

No British player in that time has got there, Tim Henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark.

Murray said: ‘It’s nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there aren’t loads.

‘Even if it doesn’t happen here then at some stage I’m sure I will get there.

‘I obviously want to win more and hopefully I still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number.

‘It’s not easy in this era to win that many matches, so it’s a good sign.’

Of those Murray victories, 24 have come so far at this event, making it his most productive Masters level tournament.

Factors like it being a familiar training base for Murray — he has a home only three miles away from this Key Biscayne island site — and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that. He is one of the best at adapting to such conditions.

After two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced South Florida’s reputation for reliable sunshine, it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against Giraldo, one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of Colombia.

The No 27 seed, who beat Murray in their previous meeting on the clay of Madrid last year, is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the ATP Tour is hardly a straightforward endeavour.

He gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by Murray’s clever mix of angles and spins.

The Scot definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago, although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident.

He let the South American, as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world, creep back from 5-1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking.
