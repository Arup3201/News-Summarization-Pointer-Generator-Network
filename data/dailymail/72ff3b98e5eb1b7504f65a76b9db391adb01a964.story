A man and woman who died just minutes apart at two different locations in Maryland Tuesday have lost their lives as a result of a murder-suicide sparked by a workplace dispute, police revealed today.

Montgomery County Police stated Wednesday that a man identified as Andrew Racca, 42, found dead inside a Mercedes-Benz that plowed into a tree in Potomac took his own life after allegedly killing the wife of his employer.

Firefighters responding to a blaze inside a garage attached to a house two miles away from the scene of the car crash came upon the body of the victim, 57-year-old Carolyn Mattingly.

Fatality: The driver of this Mercedes was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound after crashing into a tree in Potomac, Maryland 

According to police, Racca had worked for the owner of the house at 12045 Great Elm Drive, Richard Mattingly, executive vice president and COO at Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 

According to Mr Racca's LinkedIn page, he had been with the non-profit organization for more than eight years and only recently was promoted to director of network operations. 

The CFF was established in 1955 to help find a cure for the life-threatening genetic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system in children and teens.

Detectives said that on Monday, Mattingly and Racca got into a dispute after the charity executive accused the 42-year-old of workplace theft and told him that the management will have to report the allegations to police.

Racca failed to show up for work the following day and instead allegedly drove down to his boss' home in Potomac and slashed all four tires on a car parked in the driveway.

At around 1.13pm, Carolyn Mattingly called police to report the act of vandalism. Responding officers observed the cut tires and spoke to the woman, who told them that her husband was at work. 

Police filed an official report and then left the residence.

Officers received another 911 call at around 2.30pm involving a Mercedes that slammed into a tree on Piney Meeting House Road in Potomac.

The tree fell on top of the car, and by the time police responded to the scene of the crash the driver, Andrew Racca, has died. There was a pistol on the seat next to him, police said.

About 10 minutes later, local firefighters responded to the Mattinglys' sprawling two-story house on Great Elm Drive, about two miles from the scene of the vehicular accident. 

First responders extinguished a small blaze raging inside the garage, and when they entered the building, they came upon Carolyn Mattingly's body. 

Neighbors told ABC7 News that the car involved in the crash was owned by the couple who live in the home where the fire was extinguished.

'It's a tragedy out here,' neighbor David Andrukitis said. 'We've never had anything like this.'

Autopsies will be performed on the bodies to determine the causes of death.

Eyewitnesses said it appears that the Mercedes drove through a white fence surrounding the house on Great Elm Street and then careened into a tree.

According to the real estate site Zillow.com, the house at 12045 Great Elm Drive sitting on 2 acres of land is worth close to $1.4million.

In response to a request for comment made by MailOnline, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation spokeswoman Laurie Fink sent a statement Wednesday afternoon confirming the death of Mattingly's wife.

'We are devastated by the tragic death of Carolyn Mattingly, the loving wife of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, C. Richard Mattingly.

'We have learned from Montgomery County Police (MCP) that an employee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Andrew Racca, was also found deceased near the Mattingly home yesterday. 

'The police are investigating the two deaths as a possible murder-suicide. We are cooperating fully with the MCP as they continue their investigation.

'Our greatest concern is for the welfare of the Mattingly family, and we share our deepest sympathies with them during this extraordinarily difficult time.' 

Richard Mattingly has been working with the foundation since 1978, and he has been acting as the foundation’s COO for more than 20 years.

His wife worked as a realtor at Long & Foster Companies, described on its website as 'the largest real estate company in the Mid-Atlantic region.'

According to Mrs Mattingly's online profile, she was employed at Potomac Village Sales, specializing in investment property, new construction and rentals.

Carolyn Mattingly, a native of Kentucky, graduated from Eastern Kentucky University in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in real estate in urban development.

In 2003, she was appointed by the governor to serve on the Maryland Commission for Women.

The 56-year-old realtor has been heavily involved in her husband's charitable work, volunteered her time to the local Girl Scouts, coached soccer and served as president of the Winston Churchill High School Booster Club.
