The era of high-speed broadband technology is making the smart television a must-have in the modern home.

But an expert warned yesterday that connecting TVs to the internet will inevitably bring an unwanted intruder into the house – the computer virus.

With more and more films being downloaded from the internet to the household television and ‘catch-up’ TV channels becoming increasingly popular, he believes infection from viruses is only a matter of time.

Risk: An expert warned yesterday that connecting smart TVs to the internet could bring an unwanted intruder into the house ¿ the computer virus

A cyber attack on smart TVs could cause pandemonium among viewers, particularly if it coincided with a World Cup penalty shootout, a primetime drama or the results of Strictly Come Dancing.

Eugene Kaspersky, co-founder and chief executive of Russia’s Kaspersky Lab, the world’s fourth largest computer anti-virus group, said that mobile phones and then TVs are the next gadgets likely to be targeted by criminals spreading viruses worldwide.

He said his company – which receives 315,000 suspicious activity reports a day – has yet to discover a virus penetrating a television.

Televisions could soon be infected by computer viruses, one of the world's top technology security experts has warned

But he warned: ‘The threats will 
diversify to mobile phones and to the home environment, such as through 
televisions, which are now connected to the internet. There are millions
 of attacks a year on Microsoft Windows, thousands on mobile phones, 
mostly on Android, and dozens on Apple’s iOS.’

Mr Kaspersky said ‘all
 the systems are vulnerable’ and added: ‘Technically it is possible to 
infect millions of devices. It will happen. It’s just a question of 
time. What’s the difference between a TV and a computer? A bigger screen
 and a remote control.

‘It has Android inside and memory chips and 
internet connections. That’s all.’ Inevitably, the consumer will be 
forced to buy more virus protection software to tackle the threat of 
cyber invasion and the industry is gearing up to cash in.

Eugene Kaspersky, is co-founder and chief executive of Russia's Kaspersky Lab, the world's fourth largest computer antivirus group. He said threats will spread to the 'home environment' and televisions as internet connections make technology more vulnerable

At the 
start of last year, 13 per cent of the British population owned a smart 
TV, which connects to the internet using integrated technology or a 
set-top box.

But that figure is likely to have increased significantly since then with the rise of ‘catch-up’ TV.

Last May a survey found that 50 per cent of British consumers liked the idea of accessing online content through televisions.

Around 100million households in Western Europe and the US are predicted to have at least one internet-linked TV by 2016.
