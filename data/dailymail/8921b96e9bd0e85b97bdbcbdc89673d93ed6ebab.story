For the first time, a girls’ choir performs under the hallowed arches of Canterbury Cathedral.

Aged 12 to 16, they had their debut performance at Evensong on Saturday, ending a 1,000-year-old tradition that has allowed only men and boys to be choristers.

Several cathedrals, including Winchester, have had girls’ choirs for years, while others have mixed-sex choirs.

Canterbury stood firm until it announced the changes in September, prompting 40 girls from local schools to audition, before the final 16 were chosen in November.

Chorister Abby Cox, 12, said: ‘That’s the thought in the back of your mind: no girl has sung in this cathedral over an amazingly long period of time.’

The girls will initially sing at services when the boy choristers, who are boarders at St Edmund’s School, are on their twice-termly breaks.

A spokesman for Canterbury Cathedral said the long tradition of all male choirs made it difficult to change.

‘With that weight of history, it can sometimes take a little while for change to occur, he said.

‘And it is only about 20 years since the first women were ordained as priests.

‘The role of women generally in society has changed vastly within the last 20-30 years, and the Church reflects that.
