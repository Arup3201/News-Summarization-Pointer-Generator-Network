The Australian jihadi bride who ran off to the Middle East to marry a playboy turned extremist has posted chilling messages and photographs to authorities on social media.

The Twitter account, believed to be linked to 21-year-old Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, shows a photo of a fighter, posing with a rifle and a dagger along with a caption: 'Catch me if you can'.

It comes after her husband Mahmoud Abdullatif, who is known as the 'playboy jihadist', was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS in Syria two weekends ago.

Under the Twitter name Umm Abdullatif, another photograph was uploaded on Saturday of Abdullatif standing on the side of a road with snow in the background.

A Twitter account linked to Zehra Duham, has posted chilling messages and photographs to authorities 

'A few days before he attained shahadah. Was so excited to see the snow! Lol. Oh how I miss you, may Allah reunite us,' the caption said on the photo.

As security agencies continue to set up airport terror checks and monitor the watch list, Daily Telegraph reports authorities have been alarmed with around 40 Australian foreign fighters who have managed to return on Australian soil after joining the fight with IS in Iraq and Syria.

Up to 400 Australians are estimated to be fighting with IS in the Middle East or supporting the death cult across the country.

Around 20 Australians have reportedly been killed in air strikes against IS, which has attracted up to 20,000 foreign fights around the globe, according to Australian intelligence.

A senior government official told the Daily Telegraph that these estimates of active home-grown jihadists was more than the published figures revealed by the government.

'What has us concerned is that there has been no let up in the flow,' they said.

'What we [coalition air strikes) are doing in Iraq and Syria is not deterring them from going over and joining up.

'So the rate that they are taking up with these groups means there will be many we don't know about yet.'

It follows after Melbourne man Abdullatif reportedly only became a jihadist as an excuse to 'be a part of the violence' to satisfy his aggressive nature.

Abdullatif's former girlfriend came forward recently, opening up about the man she knew - a bully from Brunswick Secondary College who had a penchant for violence.

Sahini Sendeera, 21, says her ex-boyfriend was a man of extremes. 

Abdullatif was a rebel and a womaniser who never lived a religious lifestyle, yet was fiercely proud to be a Muslim according to Fairfax Media. 

'I think he liked the extreme culture of Islam and I think he just wanted to be a part of the violence,' Ms Senadeera told SMH. 

'I think for him Islam was just an excuse to behave like that.'
