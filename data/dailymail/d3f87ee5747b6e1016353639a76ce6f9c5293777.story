Row: This poster has been pulled by the students' union at the University of Kent after claims it legitimised rape

A students' union has been forced to pull down posters promoting its summer ball after complaints it encouraged the rape of vulnerable young women.

Kent Union, based at the University of Kent, used an image of a female student alone in the dark with the caption: 'Someone will lose their friends' to sell tickets for its Party in the Car Park event in June.

Critics said it suggested young women attending the event would be 'fair game'.

The National Union of Students has called the poster 'disgusting' and it led to a campaign by students to have it
 removed from the Canterbury campus.

It has also emerged that the photo used was from last year's ball and put on the poster without the young woman's permission.

The former student, named only as Kate, tweeted after seeing the poster: '@KentUnion So clearly I'm fair game 
without those pesky protective friends. Love from: Girl In The Photo'.

Student Bethany Taylor, 20, who is women's campaign officer for the Union said: 'When I first saw it, I was disgusted. I think it's really harrowing for women students in particular who may have been attacked or had a bad experience on campus.

'A lot of students, both male and female, find it quite disturbing. The picture was also used without the consent of the girl featured. It only shows her body, which objectifies her.'

Upset: The young woman in the image, a former student, also criticised the campaign, which used a photo of her without her permission

Today the Union apologised to anyone it had offended.

'We would like to sincerely apologise to the students that have been offended by one of the posters we have designed to promote this yearâ€™s Party in the Car Park. It was never our intention for the poster and its message to be interpreted in this way,' a spokesman said.

'The concept behind our marketing of the event is to use real photographs taken last year combined with factual statements provided by students.

'We can confirm that the poster has been removed and will not be used within any further marketing. In the future we will check our designs with relevant people to ensure they cannot be interpreted in a different way'.
