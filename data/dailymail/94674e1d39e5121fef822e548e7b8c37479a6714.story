The have been dubbed 'Google Glass for skiers' and mean you'll never lose a friend (or miss a text message) on the slopes again.

The new model allows users to check their Facebook status from the gadget - and even respond mid-descent.

Ski-tech: Oakley's Airwave goggles let you read emails on the slopes, as well as listen to music, make phone calls via a connection and study piste maps

Pilot style screen: The £500 goggles have a head-up display which show a skier's speed, location, altitude and distance travelled

The Googles have a fighter pilot-style screen on the inside of the lens, displaying a skier’s speed, location, altitude and distance travelled as they zoom down the slopes.

The goggles can also connect to an iPhone or Android phone or tablet, transmitting incoming calls to an earpiece.

Text messages or Facebook updates can be beamed straight onto the screen in front of the skier’s eyes.

Users can play music stored on their phone, flicking through playlists with a wireless controller worn on the wrist.

An accompanying Airwave app allows skiers or snowboarders to choose from 600 resort piste maps, and includes a ‘buddy’ setting to track friends or relatives on the slopes.

The technology harnesses the power of the latest generation of smartphones, utilising the gadgets’ GPS, communications and entertainment technology and transferring it onto the surface of the goggles via Bluetooth.

Data is shown on a display in the corner of the skier’s vision, with the effect of viewing a 14-inch screen from 5ft away.

'The new Airwave has an improved processing speed, and about a 30-35 percent increase in battery life,' Oakley's Product Category Manager, Chris Petrillo, told FoxNews.

'It's like driving your car, you look at the windshield every once or glance down to look at your speed.

He said the most popular feature was the buddy tracking system.

'Your friends will show up on the map so you know exactly where they are,'

'People really seem to love that.'

Oakley chief executive Colin Baden said at the launch of the first version: ‘Airwave represents the power and possibility of technology.’

Mr Baden said the Heads Up technology - which could possibly be adapted to fit into sunglasses - had been 15 years in the making.

‘As an organisation, we’ve been chasing this beast since 1997,’ he said earlier this year.

‘Ultimately, everything happens through your eyes, and the closer we can bring it to your eyes, the quicker the consumer is going to adopt the platform.’
