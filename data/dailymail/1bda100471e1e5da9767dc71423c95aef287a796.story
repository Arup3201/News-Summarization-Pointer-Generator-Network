New Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli spoke to the club's official website after moving to Anfield from AC Milan in a £16million deal on Monday.

Mario, welcome to Liverpool Football Club. How do you feel to have signed for the club?

I'm very happy. We've been talking about coming here and I'm happy to be here.

Done deal: Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli poses with the shirt after switching to Anfield in a £16million deal

What attracted you to the challenge here at Liverpool?

Liverpool are one of the best teams here in England. The football is very good here. It's a great team with young players, and that's why I came here.

You've received an incredible reception from the fans here already. How has that made you feel?

I didn't expect it because I've always been playing against Liverpool. Whenever I played against Liverpool, the fans weren't nice with me but that's normal - it's football! Now that I play for Liverpool, I can see the expectation in people. They're very happy and that makes me very happy at the same time.

Unexpected: Balotelli admitted Liverpool fans weren't nice with him during his time playing for Manchester City

You've previously described playing at Anfield as a 'beautiful experience' to Fabio Borini. Did you enjoy playing at Anfield as an opposing player?

No - but when I play with this team [at Anfield], it's going to be nice for sure. To play here for Liverpool excites me, but if you're an opponent it's difficult.

For someone still so young, you have a lot of experience - can you use that to help what is a young team here at Liverpool?

I maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if I can help them, I'm happy to help them.

Pen to paper: Italy international Balotelli has signed a three-year deal with the Reds worth £125,000-a-week

Liverpool are back in the Champions League after five years out, and you have got great memories of the competition; you were Inter Milan's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament and you also won it with them in 2010. Are those experiences something you can bring to Liverpool to help in the Champions League this season?

I always start a competition wanting to win it. We will see. I want to win another Champions League for sure, because the Champions League wasn't all mine, I was in a team. I want to take this team to the Champions League.

You have been away from English football for around 18 months - how do you feel about coming back?

I'm happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake. I wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake.

Regret: Balotelli admits it was a mistake to leave England when he left Man City for AC Milan in January 2013

Do you feel English football suits you better?

English football is generally better. English football is beautiful.

We know you are going to take the No.45 for Liverpool. Can you explain the significance of that shirt?

When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No.45 because the numbers for young players were from No.36 to No.50. I took No.45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games. It brings me luck and that's why I've always kept No.45.

This deal has moved very quickly over the last few days, so has it sunk in yet that you are a Liverpool player?

No. When I meet the team, start training with them and start my first game, I will realise. For now, I have just seen the city.

Superstition: Balotelli insists wearing the No 45 shirt brings him luck on the pitch

How much are you looking forward to meeting your new teammates?

I am going to meet them soon and I'm excited.

Liverpool are in action tonight against your former club, Manchester City - are you going to attend the game?

I'm going to be watching the game. I would love to play but I can't, so I'll support them from the stand.

Finally, what are your ambitions here at Liverpool? What do you hope to achieve?

As much as I can.
