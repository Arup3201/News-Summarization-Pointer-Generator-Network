Cesc Fabregas faces Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates this weekend as Chelsea host the Gunners at Stamford Bridge. We asked Arsenal fan site Highbury House just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them, especially since he's been playing so well.

If you wanted a symbol of the divide among Arsenal supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than Cesc Fabregas.

There is an on-going debate, both within the Emirates and on the numerous websites devoted to the club, about Arsene Wenger and his continued tenure and Barcelona’s sale of Fabregas to Chelsea has rubbed salt into those wounds.

For many of us, Cesc epitomised the great things Wenger achieved over so many years. He was the lingering ember, still smouldering in Barcelona, that so many Arsenal fans believed could re-ignite Wenger's reign and breathe quality back into a central midfield that had become dull.

Fabregas has been the driving force behind Chelsea's improved creativity and goal scoring this season 

He never spoke badly of the club, even after forcing the move that hurt so many of us. I could see why he wanted to go at the time, though. Barcelona had exerted a strong pull under Pep Guardiola and it was Cesc's homeland.

All the rumours about him refusing to play for us in pre-season and feigning injury were disturbing for sure but fans’ forgiveness tends to be in proportion to the player's quality and nobody could dispute Cesc had that in abundance.

After the FA Cup success the word was that Wenger would push the boat out in the summer and sign the players that just about everybody in football knew we needed.

So, when it became clear that the golden boy was available and Arsenal had a clause in his contract of sale that gave the club the right of first refusal, at a discount price, then what was the problem? Sign him, Arsene. The problem was that our manager didn't see it that way at all.

Arsene Wenger played a key role in shaping Fabregas at Arsenal into the talented player you see today

After several attempts Fabregas finally left Arsenal to return his boyhood club Barcelona in summer 2011

Now, whether this was for purely footballing reasons in that he didn't want to inhibit the growth of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey or, as Cesc has said, because of the presence of Mesut Ozil.

Or was it a bit of rather ill-judged payback for some shoddy behaviour against the man who had made him the great player he undoubtedly is? 

But the awful fact of the matter is that Arsenal said no and took a percentage of the transfer fee to, of all clubs, Chelsea.

Will Wenger's decision not to resign Fabregas come back to haunt Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this weekend? 

Those of us who have watched Mourinho's team through gritted teeth this season couldn't have failed to have noticed that he is doing rather well for them. In fact, he puts the opposition under pressure just about every time he gets the ball in their half. 

Unfortunately for us and in my opinion, Cesc was exactly the player we needed and as Wenger seems to see Ozil as a left-winger I really can't see the sense in not signing him.

The sudden drop in Ramsey's form and his subsequent two-month injury, plus the inconsistent nature of Jack's game has made the decision look worse and worse with each passing day.

But, not to sign him and at the same time strengthening Sunday¹s opponents, Mourinho¹s Chelsea? Crazy and for some of us, painful too.
