A pensioner drove for half a mile with a motorist clinging to his car bonnet before stopping the car, getting out and punching him in the face, a court heard.

Anthony Lee, 74, was caught on CCTV driving off with Paul Malin, 26, hanging from his windscreen wipers after the two men had a disagreement about a minor collision.

Footage played to the court showed Lee reversing into Mr Malin's parked purple Vauxhall Corsa as he tried to parallel park his green Subaru outside the Grove Tavern in Bournemouth.

It sparked a row that ended with Lee driving off with Mr Malin on his bonnet and ended when he stopped the car half a mile away and punched Mr Malin in the face, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.

Mr Malin told jurors he was working in the pub's cellar when a regular, Matt Fitzroy-Titley, told him someone had just reversed into his car, and they went outside to see what had happened. 

Barman Mr Malin came out of the pub and approached the driver only to be flung on the bonnet.

Lee came to a halt half a mile away and then got out and twice punched Mr Malin in the face, jurors were told.

The barman said: 'Matt approached the man and said to him "You've just reversed into my mate's car". The man was very dismissing.

'Matt said: "If you don't get out of your car, I'm going to call the police".

'The man became quite agitated. The next thing I knew I was on the bonnet of the car.

'It happened so fast I didn't have a chance to react. It was a case of on the car or under the car. I held on for dear life. The man then drove off down the high street with me on the bonnet.

Mr Malin said: 'It happened so fast I didn't have a chance to react.  It was a case of on the car or under the car'

Lee, of Bournemouth, told police he had felt threatened by the pair and thought the best thing to do was drive off

'I was screaming all sorts of profanities at him, but he wasn't looking at me.

'The car paused briefly at traffic lights. That moment felt like a lifetime. I was not sure whether to stay on the car or try to get off. Before I could make a decision I was off down the high street again.'

Mr Malin, who said he had suffered from back pain since the incident, said when the car finally stopped, the elderly motorist got out and hit him in the face.

He added: 'The man jumped out and shouted at me. I was still in shock. He grabbed my shirt and pulled me towards him.

'The next thing I knew I had a right hook to the face.'

Scene of the incident: Mr Malin was working at the Grove Tavern in the Southbourne area of Bournemouth

Mr Malin, a photographer and graphic designer, said he grabbed the keys to Lee's car through an open window then ran off down the street to get help.

A concerned passerby took Mr Malin to her home then dialled 999.

The court heard that in a police interview Lee said that he had felt threatened by the pair and thought the best thing to do was drive off.

Lee, from Bournemouth, denies one count of dangerous driving and one of assault by beating. 

The trial continues.
