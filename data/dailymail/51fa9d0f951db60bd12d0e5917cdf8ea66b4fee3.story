No one expects to park their car free of charge next to the airport terminal building while they fly abroad on holiday. But then neither do they expect to be charged simply for dropping off or picking up friends and family at the airport — let alone fined if they take too long.

Yet that is exactly what Luton and many other British airports now do. Since Birmingham Airport first introduced drop-off charges in 2007, they have been quietly — some would say sneakily — introduced by nine other regional airports. Entry barrier ticket machines, coupled with high-tech number-plate recognition cameras, monitor your arrival and departure.

Drive up to Luton’s drop-off point and you will be charged £2. Leave your car unattended while you help your passengers find their way to the right check-in desk, or exceed the maximum 15 minutes waiting time, and you will be hit with an £80 penalty.

Sky-high: The car park at Heathrow, where it costs £163.90 to park your car for eight days

And the same applies if you stop, even for a few seconds, on any of the airport’s approach roads.This week, councils have been widely condemned for the excessive charges they impose on motorists for on-street parking. Between them, they made profits of £565 million in parking charges and fines.

In fact, it is illegal for councils to use parking as a source of revenue. But when it comes to predatory airport parking companies, there is no legislation to protect motorists from extreme charges. Airports can charge whatever they like.

Alongside the excessive drop-off charges and ‘fines’ for anyone who, unfamiliar with the road layouts, stops momentarily to read a sign, or adjust a rear-view mirror, airports have jacked up their long-term parking charges.

It now costs £163.90 to park a car at Heathrow for eight days and £302.50 for 15 days. Southampton charges £171 for two weeks’ parking and Bournemouth £160. And, unlike Heathrow, where you can still drop off someone for nothing, Bournemouth Airport charges £2.50 just to stop briefly and let out a passenger.

Airports try to distance themselves from blame by saying parking and traffic management are contracted out to specialist firms. What’s more, many of these firms are foreign-owned.

Ridiculous: A parked plane gets a better deal than a parked car these days at airports

Money-maker: Cars parked at Gatwick airport car park

For example, overstay at Luton and you will receive a ‘parking charge notice’ from a German-based company called Apcoa, which also manages car parking at Heathrow, Gatwick, Southampton, Exeter and Aberdeen airports, and runs the traffic management at Birmingham Airport. 

Stansted and Edinburgh airports contract out parking to a Spanish company called Empark.

Both firms collect money from motorists via what they call ‘Parking Charge Notices’ — named, presumably, to ape official, police-issued ‘Penalty Charge Notices’. These dress the fees up as fines, but they are not legally fines.

In truth, parking on private land is governed by contract law, and in order to collect the money, the parking company would have to take out a civil action in court.

Some motorists have rumbled this and refuse to pay, resulting in some parking companies dropping the charge — presumably for fear that the courts would rule that their parking charges represent an unfair contract. But most motorists simply pay up.

In for a penny in for a pound: Airport car parking is very much seen as a rip-off and now has to be factored in when working out holiday costs

I approached several airports to ask how much revenue they generated from parking. Most refused to say, citing ‘commercial sensitivity’.

But Manchester Airports Group, the largest UK-owned airports operator in the country, said that in the year to March 2013 it earned £59  million from parking fees at Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports.

That is 14.3  per cent of total revenues, and £7  million more than it earned from parking the year before. Despite claims that increased charges are designed to encourage use of public transport and to reduce traffic congestion, squeezing cash from motorists is a lucrative source of income.

In many cases, airports must be extracting more money from passengers parking their cars than from them as air passengers.

EasyJet, for example, is advertising flights from Gatwick to Milan or Sardinia for £52 return. But parking your car in the long-term car park for a week at Gatwick will cost exactly twice this: £104.

At some airports it now costs more to park a car than a plane. Manchester, which charges £35 per day in its short-term car park, charges only £21 for a six-seater light aircraft to be parked on the runway apron for the same period.

Even an Airbus A380 gets four hours’ free parking on the apron at Manchester. Not so motorists, who must pay £2.80 to park their car for a mere half an hour.

Luke Bosdet, of the AA, says: ‘Where airports see a motorist, they see a pound sign.

‘It is not unreasonable to want to move passengers along quickly and so to cut congestion, but airports could do that by employing marshals to move motorists along, not by penalising them with high charges.’

He adds that concessions should also be made for cars dropping off disabled people.Some airports have even used the threat of terrorism as an  excuse for charging drivers who drop off passengers.

A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport, which charges £1 to enter its drop-off zone, said the area had to be redesigned after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport in 2007.

But Bournemouth Airport, which charges £2.50 for cars that drop off a passenger, admits that ‘the prime rationale for the charge is commercial’ and has been driven by the fact that passenger numbers have fallen during the recession.

Crazy money: Parking a car for a fortnight is more expensive than parking up a plane

When Stansted Airport introduced a £2 charge for vehicles to enter its drop-off zone last year, its then owners, the Spanish group Ferrovial, claimed the charge was part of an ‘environmentally friendly’ travel plan to encourage the use of public transport.

But if it is so concerned about  its carbon emissions, why doesn’t it end its short-haul routes and tell passengers to take the train instead? A spokesman for the airport’s new owners, Manchester Airports Group, admitted that ‘car parking is used to keep charges low for airlines, resulting in cheaper air fares for our passengers’.

What he really means is that the airport has lost business from budget airlines, which have been shopping around for cheaper landing fees elsewhere, and that the airport is reduced to trying to cream a profit from motorists instead.

It is impossible to know how many passengers, stung by Stansted’s £2 drop-off charge, have vowed never to go back to the airport.

But figures show that while there were 24 million passengers in 2007, last year the number had dropped to 17.5  million. A spokesman for the airport says that its parking charges are now ‘under review’.

If the airports want us to carrying on travelling, and spending money in their shops, perhaps they could start by removing the threats and excessive charges they are using to fleece us when we dare to travel to the airport by car.

In other words, stop acting as pirates and concentrate on returning air travel to what it once was: a pleasure, not an experience which leaves us fuming before our plane has even taken off.
