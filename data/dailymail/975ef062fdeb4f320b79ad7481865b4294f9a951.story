Thibaut Courtois believes Petr Cech should leave Chelsea - and admitted that's what he would do if he was out of favour at the club.

Courtois has kept the Czech Republic international out of the Chelsea line-up so far this season and he thinks Cech should review his future at Stamford Bridge.

The Belgian encouraged his team-mate and rival to look at other options, because, he says, goalkeepers always want to get game time.

'As a goalkeeper you want to play,' Courtois told Sky Sports.

'If I was in that situation where I didn't play a lot, then I would leave too.' 

'I think Petr is still a goalkeeper with a lot of quality and one of the best there is.'

The Chelsea No 1 is aware that there is already talk of the Blues going unbeaten for the whole season, but he said winning the Premier League is the most important thing.

'Obviously a lot of people hope that we can go unbeaten, we will see. The Premier League is a very hard competition, so I think that's maybe why just one team did it [Arsenal], but I think it will be hard,' Courtois added.

'It's more important to be champions, and if it is unbeaten then OK.'
