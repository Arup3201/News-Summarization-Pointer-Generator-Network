Ben Richards has opened up about his battle with bowel cancer, saying he dismissed unusual symptoms because he was a 'typical man' and dreaded the idea of going to a doctor about 'that part' of his body.

But six months after ignoring the tell-tale signs he was undergoing emergency surgery as well as having chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive bowel cancer.

‘I was just a total bloke about the situation,’ says Ben, 41, who has recently become ambassador for Bowel Cancer UK.

Ben is pictured surrounded by nurses in March 2012 while undergoing chemotherapy for his bowel cancer at the Spire Harpenden Private Hospital in Hertforshire

‘Like most men I didn’t want to even 
think about going to a doctor and it wasn’t until my 
then wife Helen nagged me that I eventually saw my GP.’

Ben, who has starred in Footballers Wives, Holby City and The Bill, had been suffering with a small amount of blood in his stools and had noticed his bowel movements had changed.

But he presumed that the blood was down to internal piles and his irregularity was due to the fact he had been travelling around India.

In January 2012, Ben eventually listed the symptoms to his doctor, and he recommended Ben see a specialist as a matter of urgency.

By chance Ben managed to get a last minute appointment with a private doctor within a few hours.

The specialist advised a colonoscopy, to take a tissue sample from the bowel, and a CT scan.

Ben felt well and never thought for a second that his minor symptoms could be the signs of something as deadly as bowel cancer

A week later, Ben went for his tests at the Harpenden Spire Private Hospital. The scan immediately showed up a 6cm tumour in his bowel and he was diagnosed with cancer on the spot.

‘I couldn’t quite compute what the doctor had told me,’ remembers Mark. ‘It was terrifying and cancer had always been something that happened to other people, not me.

Ben had been scheduled to take time out from his role playing Franklin Hart in Dolly Parton’s musical, 9 To 5, and to fly to Los Angeles for ‘pilot season’ - when actors promote themselves aiming for career success Stateside.

'I had no family history of the disease 
either, so it never occurred to me that symptoms I had mistaken 
for IBS and piles could be something so serious.'

When Ben first opened up about his battle, he referred to wife of nine years, Helen, as his 'rock'.

She had been having fertility treatment and they were desperate to start a family after losing  babies due to a rare genetic bone and cartilage condition.

Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year.

It usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel.

Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss.

It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women.

Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly.

Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk.

The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent.

Ben had been due to visit LA for work, but he was forced to cancel his plans to undergo emergency surgery.

'Surgeons were forced to remove almost half my bowel which was incredibly painful,' says Ben. 'The whole combination of treatments was a shock to the system and to be honest I felt awful.'

He also underwent a number of six-week cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Despite minor complications, he has made a full recovery and has been in remission for four months now.

In
 January he announced that he had gone into remission, a year to the day
 of his diagnosis, tweeting: 'Told today that its exactly 1 year 
tomorrow since I was diagnosed... fingers crossed for happier results 
xx.'

He now says he is 
feeling 'better than ever' although he does admit he has become more 
vigilant about his health.

‘I
 have always eaten healthily but now I’m extra careful. I don’t eat red 
meat and wheat and I’ve given up beer entirely – much as I miss it – 
because I just don’t want to take the risk of the cancer returning.’

Cancer battle: Ben Richards, appearing in Holby City has spoken about how he didn't get checked out

Ben is now returning to the 9 To 5 tour and will be joining the rest of the cast in Wolverhampton in a matter of weeks.

And he is keen to pass on the message of how important it is for men to monitor bowel health.

'Bowel
 cancer was always thought to be something that happened to old people 
and particularly those who have eaten a bad diet, but this simply isn't 
true.' he said.

'If you get any of the symptoms of 
bowel cancer such as blood or abdominal discomfort, don't self-diagnose 
of ignore it. Getting it checked could save your life.'
