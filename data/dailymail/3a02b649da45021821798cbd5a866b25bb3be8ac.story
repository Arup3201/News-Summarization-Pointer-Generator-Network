Britain’s economy will soon grind to a halt and a recovery is still years away, the Bank of England warned yesterday.

It slashed its growth forecast for the year to zero, partly due to the effect of ‘storm clouds’ in the eurozone.

It predicted growth of 0.8 per cent as recently as May – revised down from the 2 per cent forecast made last year.

Uncertain: The UK is struggling to recover ground lost when recession hit in 2008 - confirming a double-dip

As the Bank published its inflation 
report, Governor Sir Mervyn King poured cold water on the prospect of an
interest rate cut from the historic low of 0.5 per cent.

He said: ‘It is not going to make the difference between having a recovery and not having a recovery.’

Instead,
he urged eurozone leaders to get to grips with the debt crisis tearing 
through the single currency bloc, describing it as ‘a black cloud of 
uncertainty’ over the global economy.

Gloom: Governor Sir Mervyn King said the economy will not grow during 2012

‘It’s a saga that goes on and on and 
on,’ he said. ‘The idea that we have come to the end of it is 
unrealistic. There is still a long way to go.

'Anyone
who pretends to know what’s going to happen in the euro area over the 
next two or three years is simply not being realistic.’

A Treasury spokesman said the Bank cited the eurozone as ‘the biggest single threat to the UK recovery’.

It comes as former deputy governor of
the Bank of England John Gieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that 
the Bank should have done more, sooner, when the credit crunch struck 
five years ago today.

Last month the Bank of England injected an additional £50 billion into 
the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total
stock to £375billion

He said the Bank was slow to realise 
that exceptional measures were needed, adding: 'We'd expected a 
correction in the markets, not a total meltdown'.

Meanwhile, Sir Mervyn admitted he has no idea when a robust recovery will finally get under way.

‘We will get back to the same growth 
rates that we experienced before the crisis, but it’s quite impossible 
to know over what time period,’ he said.

The economy is ‘healing’ but it will be ‘a long, slow process’ and the full recovery ‘may lie some years ahead’, he added.

Chancellor George Osborne said the 
Government must give ‘110 per cent attention and effort and energy to 
getting the economy moving’.

David Cameron admitted Britain’s 
plunge into its longest and deepest downturn for more than a century has
been ‘disappointing’, but added: ‘We just have to roll up our sleeves.’

Economists described yesterday’s 
inflation report as one of the most depressing ever, with predictions of
economic growth peaking at just 2.25 per cent in 2014 and 2015.

This is the lowest ‘peak forecast’ in the quarterly inflation reports since the Bank was granted independence in 1997.

George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘This is a material shift in Bank of England thinking.

'The Bank is not confident that we are going to see a return to the growth levels seen before the crisis.’

Sir Mervyn, who retires next June, 
said: ‘We are navigating through rough waters and storm clouds continue 
to roll in from the euro area.

Deflated: Rampant price rises have fallen away and the Bank now believes inflation will fall below target in the coming years

‘Output has been at best broadly flat
over the past two years, and has continually disappointed expectations 
of recovery. Unlike the Olympians who have thrilled us over the past 
fortnight, our economy has not yet reached full fitness.’

However, he added that the squeeze on family finances was finally ‘coming to an end’ as the cost of living falls.

The consumer price index measure of 
inflation, which was as high as 5.2 per cent in September, has more than
halved to 2.4 per cent and will continue to drop, he said.

The Bank’s report states that CPI is ‘more likely than not to be around or a little below target [2 per cent]’ for some time.

Experts warned that 
weaker-than-expected growth will force the Chancellor to borrow even 
more than planned as tax receipts slump.

Graeme Leach, chief economist at the 
Institute of Directors, said: ‘If the Bank’s view on the economy comes 
to pass, the Chancellor faces a very rough road with the public finances
as he tries to cut the deficit.’

Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary
to the Treasury, said: ‘It is clear that we cannot go on with the same 
failing plan from this Government.

'The Chancellor’s policies aren’t only causing short-term pain, but long-term damage to our economy too.’

However, when asked if it was time 
for the Government to ditch its attempts to tackle the deficit and adopt
a fiscal plan B, Sir Mervyn said: ‘No.’

The Bank’s report also opened the 
door to a further round of quantitative easing, on top of the 
£375billion it has already unleashed in a desperate bid to spark a 
recovery.
