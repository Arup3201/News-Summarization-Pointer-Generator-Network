Adam Lallana's £23million move to Liverpool has seen his former club Bournemouth scoop up £5.75million thanks to a shrewd sell-on clause in his Southampton contract.

Sportsmail looks at those clubs who have cashed in from sell-on clauses and those who have missed out.

Watford received £2.5million from Ashley Young’s £17million transfer from Aston Villa to Manchester United in 2011.

The Hornets wisely insisted on a 15 per cent sell-on clause when they let their academy product leave for Aston Villa four years earlier.

Dagenham and Redbridge negotiated a 20 per cent sell-on clause when they sold Dwight Gayle to Peterborough in January 2013.

When he was sold to Crystal Palace last summer the Daggers bagged £1million of the initial fee.

Arsenal netted over £7million from a 50 per cent sell-on clause in David Bentley’s move to Blackburn.

When Rovers sold Bentley to Tottenham for a fee in the region of £15million the Gunners reaped the rewards from their North London rivals.

Les Ferdinand’s £6million move from QPR to Newcastle back in 1995 earned non-league club Hayes a handy £600,000, a healthy profit for the club - now known as Hayes and Yeading - considering he cost them just £5,000.

The club used the money to build a function suite named 'The Ferdinand Suite', in honour of their most famous son.

Southampton waived their 25 per cent sell-on clause on Gareth Bale when they experienced financial difficulties in 2008.

The Saints accepted £3million plus young goalkeeper Tommy Forecast in exchange for their stake in the Welshman, although keeping the deal in place would've earned them around £20million from the winger's move to Real Madrid last summer.

Forecast was released in 2013 without ever appearing for the first team.

West Ham also missed out on a huge windfall when they failed to include a sell-on clause in their deal to sell Rio Ferdinand to Leeds in 2000.

Ferdinand was sold to Manchester United just two years later for £30m.

The Hammers failed to learn from their mistake when, just four years later, they sold Michael Carrick to Tottenham for £2.75million.

Spurs sold Carrick to Manchester United for £18.6million two years later and the East London club were once again left to rue a missed opportunity.
