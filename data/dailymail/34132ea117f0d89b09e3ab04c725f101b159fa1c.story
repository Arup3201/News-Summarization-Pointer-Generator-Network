Being born with no right arm below the elbow never held Lexi Daniels back, as a new video shows.

The 15-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, was filmed as she performed a rigorous hip hop dance routine to Waka Floka Flame's No Hands.

Daniels was caught in action while attending a dance convention in Pittsburgh earlier this month.

The film was uploaded to YouTube by her instructor, Will 'WilldaBeast' Adams, a choreographer who has worked with the likes of Madonna and Usher.

To date the clip has garnered more than one millions hits, with many viewers citing Daniels as an inspiration.

The athletic brunette said she got lost in the moment as she bopped away.

'I got an adrenaline rush that I rarely feel,' she told People magazine.

'It's like my whole world was a dream come true for 50 seconds. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.'

She said that she wan't insulted by the song choice and laughed with friends when she heard the lyrics because they were so 'ironic.'

Daniels was born with amniotic band syndrome, a fetal condition which causes  thin strands of tissue to constrict the growth of limbs.

Her right arm stops at the elbow and she has 'stubs' as fingers. As a youngster, she tried wearing a prosthetic arm but quickly gave it up.

Despite facing obstacles, Daniels hasn't let her disability hold her back.

Indeed, her Instagram account carries the playful motto: 'Who needs two arms?' 

She started dance lessons at the age of three and her favorite styles include ballet, hip hop and modern. She's also a member of her school's cheerleading team.

The teenager added: 'When people say I can't do something it just gives me more motivation to prove them wrong.

'Dance is my passion, and I am not going to give up on something just because of the way I was born.'

Daniels typically spends up to five hours after school practicing her dance moves and often competes in competitions on weekends.

One of dreams includes starring on the TV show America’s Got Talent.

Daniels' father Rick previously told The Columbus Dispatch that he 'fights off tears' every time he watches her perform.

He concluded: 'Obviously, she’s my daughter. But you don’t just watch her; she makes you feel her. It’s almost like she’s singing it, singing a beautiful song.'
