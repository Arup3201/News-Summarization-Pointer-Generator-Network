Kim's bottom might have almost broken the internet, but Kylie Jenner's lips have also made their fair share of headlines in recent weeks.

The youngest Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has been been repeatedly criticised for her pouty social media snaps, with many claiming that her full lips are the result of cosmetic surgery. 

But in an exclusive interview with FEMAIL, Kylie's make-up artist rubbishes reports that the 17-year-old's lips are fake and reveals that it's actually very simple to recreate her look.

Perfect pout: Kylie Jenner, 17, has been showing her full lips on social media in recent weeks and now her make-up artist Rob Scheppy has revealed how he achieves the look

Sharing the two-product secret behind Kylie's perfect pout, Rob Scheppy said: 'I find it funny that so much attention is drawn to my work, but I like it. 

'Kylie's lips are created using expertly applied lip liner and a little lip balm.'

And it seems her sisters agree - Kim recently told MailOnline that she takes inspiration from her younger sister.

She said: 'I live with Kylie so every time she's putting on her lashes or putting on her lip liner, I ask her for advice on how she does it so perfectly. She is so good at make-up.'

Khloe agrees, adding: 'Sophia Loren is my icon but I also love my little sister Kylie and what she does with her make-up and her hair is really funky and cool.'

'I swear her make-up takes her fifteen minutes, she does it all the time and it doesn't take her long and it looks so natural. It doesn't look like she has piled it on.' 

Kylie Jenner was accused by fans of having plastic surgery to enhance her looks, which the youngster has slammed.

The Australian edition of OK! Magazine alleged the reality star has had a nose job, lip fillers and Botox.

But a representative for Miss Jenner told Mail Online: ‘That’s so ridiculous and not true.’

Rob, who has been working with the family for years, is often described as the man who pioneered contouring, using Kim Kardashian as his muse. 

But despite the acclaim, Rob is extremely modest about the success of his work. 

He said: 'I'm not sure if that's true. If anything, I am just the messenger and that feels good.

'I am always trying new techniques, which I think is really important as it’s easy to stick to what you know with makeup - sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. 

'I am happy when I make my clients feel good.'

So how does he give the reality stars that famous Kardashian glow?

One routine he has stuck to religiously when working with the girls is skin preparation, which he believes is 'essential for glowing skin'.

He said: 'The girls take great care of themselves and that helps a lot. 

'I typically start with a light moisturiser and then foundation and I use as little powder as possible, so the skin keeps that glow. 

Oh and a good highlighter always helps.' 

Part of the family: Rob travels the world with the sisters and often features in their social media snaps - Kylie even took him as her date to Kim and Kanye's pre-wedding dinner

Rob's number one beauty tip though, is that the natural look is always better. 

He said: 'Like all magic tricks you need the illusion for the trick to work but I can say that...less is more and more is less, more or less.'

In terms of products, he loves using MAC lip liners on Kylie and also swears by Eyeko products, which Alexa Chung is the face of and has created her own range for. 

He said: 'I really love Eyeko mascaras, eyeliners, the brow liner and lash wardrobe.

'The mascaras are the best for creating a really full lash, and the liquid brow pen is so perfectly subtle and long-lasting. 

'I love it for filling in any gaps and enhancing natural brows.'

Famous fans: Kim and Khloe both say younger sister Kylie is their beauty icon

Rob travels the world with the sisters and often features in their social media snaps - Kylie even took him as her date to Kim and Kanye's pre-wedding dinner.

So what is it like Keeping Up With The Kardashians? 

'I feel like part of the family,' he said. 

'My favourite thing is sharing all the things I love with them, like makeup and traveling and having fun.'
