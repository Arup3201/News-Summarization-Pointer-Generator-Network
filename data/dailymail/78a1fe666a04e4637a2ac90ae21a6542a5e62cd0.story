The media portrayal of African Americans has come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown as many outlets used a photo of the teen throwing what could be perceived as a gang sign instead of a clearer, more thoughtful photo.

The 18-year-old died after he was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, sparking looting and riots across the city.

Now African Americans across the country have started posting contrasting images of themselves to Twitter along with the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown, in protest to the way the media portrays black people.

The media portrayal of Michael Brown (pictured), who was killed when he was shot by police, has come under scrutiny after a picture of him making a hand gesture (right) was used by media organisations

Lawyer CJ Lawrence was the first to use the hashtag, when he posted it to Twitter along with these two pictures of himself, to pose the question which would be used in media reports if he was shot dead

Lawyer CJ Lawrence was the first to use the hashtag when he posted it along with a picture of him speaking at his university graduation, alongside former president Bill Clinton, as well as a picture of him dressed as a rapper at a Halloween party.

The question poses which picture the media would choose to use if he was shot and became the subject of a news report.

According to BBC Trending, Mr Lawrence described how while the question was a rhetorical one, 'in reality it's something we ask ourselves every day as African Americans.'

Mr Lawrence said he decided to raise the issue after becoming frustrated by the pictures used by the media of Mr Brown in news reports of his killing.

Mr Lawrence said while a graduation picture was widely used initially, an image of Mr Brown wearing a sports top and appearing to make a hand gesture, which could have been interpreted by some as a gang-sign, became more popular in subsequent reports.

The hashtag has now been used by dozens of  Twitter users posting two pictures of themselves in different situations.

 user @dsonoiki posted these two pictures along with the hashtag 
#iftheygunnedmedown and the question 'which pic would the news use'

Another Twitter user posted these two pictures along with the hashtag, and asked: 'What picture would they choose? Would they paint me as a honor graduate or bandana wearing thug?'

In one picture, the poster is usually in what could be seen as a 'positive' role, while in the other image the Twitter user is in what could be regarded as a 'negative' role.

The posts pose the question, which image would be used in their portrayal in the media if they were shot in a similar incident which led to the death of Mr Brown.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Mr Brown's death, looking into possible civil rights violations. Witnesses have said that Mr Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly.

Mr Brown's parents have been among those calling for calm. His family members, who had planned to drop him off at a technical college on Monday to begin his studies, have asked people to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting.

Authorities have so far been vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting - which is being investigated by the St. Louis County police at the smaller city's request - was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer's weapon discharged one time inside a patrol car.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Mr Brown on the street.

Mr Brown 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Mr Walker told The Associated Press. The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.' The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded.

Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Mr Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Mr Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle.

Mr Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Mr Brown got scared and ran away.

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Mr Johnson said. 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.'

'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Mr Johnson said. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

Mr Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances that preceded the first gunshot.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex or from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but has not yet put to use.

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Mr Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who was later acquitted of murder charges.

'Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,' said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Mr Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida.

'I don't want to sugarcoat it,' Mr Crump added. Mr Brown 'was executed in broad daylight.'

Police in riot gear last night fired tear gas into a crowd of protesters in Ferguson as tension rose even amid calls for collective calm.

Between two nights of unrest, a community forum hosted by the local chapter of the NAACP civil rights group Monday night drew hundreds to a sweltering church in Ferguson, a St. Louis County suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70 per cent black.

Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, said a large crowd that gathered throughout the day yesterday at the site of a burned-out convenience store turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police. Officers used tear gas and shot 'beanbag rounds' meant to stun them, he said.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. Nearly three dozen people had been arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers.

'People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,' said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity. 'Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.'

National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to 'turn your anger into action' while condemning a violent response to Mr Brown's death.

'To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,' he said. 'Courage is when you strive for justice.'

'Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,' he added.
