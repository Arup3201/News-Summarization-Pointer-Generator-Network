Tottenham Hotspur are willing to listen to offers for Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor but are struggling to find takers for the strikers.

The White Hart Lane club will sell but want to recoup the majority of the £26million fee spent on Soldado when they bought him from Valencia last year, while Adebayor's wages are also a problem for suitors.

Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez and West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino are among those admired by manager Mauricio Pochettino as he looks to liven up his strike options but ideally Spurs want to balance the books.

Soldado has struggled at Spurs but they want to recuperate the majority of the £26m he cost them last year

Adebayor has recently criticised Spurs' fans and his wages would be an issue for any potential suitors

Manchester City are also interested in Rodriguez who is continuing to recover from knee ligament surgery.

The Sky Blues see Rodriguez as someone who can add a different dimension to their squad as well as boost their homegrown contingent.

They maintain an interest in Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus, though face competition from Chelsea and Real Madrid among others.
