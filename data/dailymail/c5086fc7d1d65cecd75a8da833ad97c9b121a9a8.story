School pupils on a trip to France were left in tears after their coach was targeted twice by illegal immigrants.

Youngsters from St John Fisher Catholic High School in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, were forced to watch as border officers detained two stowaways at Calais. 

One suspect tried to board the bus when the pupils were going through passport control and another was spotted breaking in while the children were at a shopping centre.

Pupils at St John Fisher Catholic High School were left horrified after two stowaways tried to get on their coach during a trip to France 

Both of the suspects were arrested in front of the horrified children during the £300 four-day trip.  

A source told The Sun that some of the children were 'visibly upset' when they realised the intruders were not their friends or teachers.

They said: 'There were a few tears but everyone toughed it out.

'Quite frankly anything could have happened and it was understandable that everyone was a little bit jittery knowing the bus was being targeted.'

Kevin Higgins, the school's headteacher said: 'The coach drivers and the staff followed all the correct procedures and took the right course of action.'  

There are currently up to 1,000 immigrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone.

Most play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach England in the back of lorries.

Once in the UK they claim asylum, which entitles them to generous benefits, or disappear into the black economy.
