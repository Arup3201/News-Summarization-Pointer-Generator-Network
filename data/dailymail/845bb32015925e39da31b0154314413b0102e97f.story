A stroll across the tree tops of Tyrol high in the Austrian alps will finally be possible from Saturday with the opening of the long-awaited 1,329feet-long suspension bridge, Highline179.

The bridge connecting the ruins of 700-year-old Castle Ehrenberg with the remains of the 17th-century Roman fortress Claudia in the market town of Reutte welcomes its first visitors from 3pm on November 22.

From the lofty height of 376 feet, up to 500 people at any one time can walk along the 4ft-wide bridge between the historic relics, with the stunning mountains and valleys always in sight, for eight euros (£6.30) for adults and five (£3.95) for ages four to 14.

The bridge, which is 376 feet high, 1,329 feet long and just 3.93 feet wide, will cost eight euros per adult crossing

Height: 376 feet (114,60m)

Length: 1,329 feet (403m)

Width: 3.93 feet (1.2m)

Supported by: Four supporting cables       (2.6 inches) plus 16 rock anchors

Dead weight: 70 tonnes

Bridge load: Maximum 500 people

Crossing the B179, from which the bridge takes its name, Highline179 took 206 days to construct but in reality has been 16 years in the making.

The castle-to-castle bridge was first conceived in 1998 by the architect Armin Walch, whose original vision pales in comparison to the ambitious structure now ready to welcome its first official visitors.

'At that time the suspension bridge was to be a mere 250 metres in length,' says the bridge's official website. 'In 2008 the plans were revised and the length of the bridge was then to span 312 metres and with that, be the “longest suspension bridge in the Alps”.'

The design was again expanded to 403m in 2012 before construction began earlier this year.

Just four supporting cables, each 60mm wide, support the bridge that has a dead weight of 70 tonnes, while 16 rock anchors at each end provide additional safety.

From Sunday the bridge will be open we will be open daily from 8am to 10pm.
