After 15 years of painstaking restoration, scientists say they are on the brink of solving what sank the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley - the first sub in history to wreck an enemy warship.

Considered the Confederacy's stealth weapon during the Civil War, the hand-cranked Hunley sank the Union warship Housatonic in winter 1864 and then disappeared with all eight Confederate sailors inside. 

Its remains were discovered in 1995 in waters off South Carolina and five later it was raised to a conservation lab.

Now with about 70per cent of the hull cleaned of heavy rust, Paul Mardikian, a senior conservator on the Hunley project, says that crucial clues have been unearthed but 'it's too early to talk about it yet.'

Painstaking: Conservators work at removing the encrustation from the hull of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley at a conservation lab in North Charleston, South Carolina on January 27, 2015

Code-breakers: Scientists say that  about 70 per cent of the encrusted sand, silt and rust from the outside of the sub has been removed - they hope that when the entire hull is revealed, it will provide the clues as to why the Hunley sank

He added: 'It's like unwrapping a Christmas gift after 15 years. We have been wanting to do this for many years now. We have a submarine that is encrypted. It's like an Enigma machine.' 

He said the clues will be studied closely as scientists finally piece together what happened to the 40-foot submarine that night decades ago. 

The narrow, top-secret 'torpedo fish,' built in Mobile, Alabama by Horace Hunley from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand-cranked propeller, arrived in Charleston in 1863 while the city was under siege by Union troops and ships.

In the ensuing few months, it sank twice after sea trial accidents, killing 13 crew members including Horace Hunley, who was steering.

'There are historical references that the bodies of one crew had to be cut into pieces to remove them from the submarine,' said Mardikian.

'There was forensic evidence when they found the bones (between 1993 and 2004 in a Confederate graveyard beneath a football stadium in Charleston) that that was true.'

The Confederate Navy hauled the sub up twice, recovered the bodies of the crew, and planned a winter attack. From a metal spar on its bow, the Hunley planted a 135-pound torpedo in the hull of the ship, which burned and sank.

Before the collision, a lookout on the Housatonic spotted a bizarre vessel approaching just below the surface - with only its coning tower visible - and sounded the alarm.

The Housatonic's cannons couldn't be lowered enough to fire at the strange craft, so crewmen used rifles and pistols, but these were not effective.

Some historians say that the submarine showed a mission-accomplished lantern signal from its hatch to troops back on shore before it disappeared.

Soon after the signal had been fired, the sub sank about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) off Charleston.

More than a century later, in 1995, the Hunley was discovered off the South Carolina. It was raised in 2000 and brought to a conservation lab in North Charleston.

Mardikian has the lantern, which archaeologists found in the submarine more than a century later, in his laboratory.

Scientists removed ten tons of sediment from the submarine, along with the bones, skulls and even brain matter of the crew members. They also found fabric and sailors' personal belongings.

Facial reconstructions were made of each member of the third and final crew. They are displayed along with other artifacts in a museum near the submarine. In a nearby vault is a bent gold coin that archaeologists also found in the submarine.

Origins of name: After it was unveiled, the sub sank twice during sea trials, killing 13 crew members including Horace Hunley, who was steering - The Confederate Navy recovered the bodies and planned a winter attack using the vessel 

The USS Housatonic was sunk by the H.L. Hunley in February of 1864 off the coast of South Caroline

It was carried by the sub's captain, Lieutenant George Dixon, for good luck after it stopped a bullet from entering his leg during the Battle of Shiloh in 1862.

'The submarine was a perfect time capsule of everything inside,' said Ben Rennison, one of three maritime archaeologists on the project.

For almost 15 years the sub sat in a 90,000-gallon tank of fresh water to leech salt out of its iron hull.

Then, last May it was finally ready to be bathed in a solution of sodium hydroxide to loosen the encrustation. 

Four months later scientists, using small air-powered chisels and dental tools, began the laborious job of removing the coating.

The Hunley Project is a partnership among the South Carolina Hunley Commission, Clemson University Restoration Institute, the Naval Historical Center and the nonprofit Friends of the Hunley.

The nonprofit group raised and spent $22 million on the project through 2010, said a spokeswoman. 

Scientists have found the vessel to be a more sophisticated feat of engineering than historians had thought, said Michael Drews, director of Clemson's Warren Lasch Conservation Center.

'It has the ballast tanks fore and aft, the dive planes were counterbalanced, the propeller was shrouded,' Drews said. 'It's just got all of the elements that the modern submarines have, updated.'

There were previous submarines, Drews said, but the Hunley, designed to sail in the open ocean and built for warfare, was cutting-edge technology at the time.

'Dixon's mission was to attack and sink an enemy ship and he did,' Drews said. 'At that particular time, the mindset of naval warfare was, basically, big ships sink little ships.

'Little ships do not sink big ships. And the Hunley turned that upside down.'
