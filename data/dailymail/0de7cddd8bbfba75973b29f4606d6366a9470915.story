Good news: A pill that could save the lives of thousands suffering from a common heart condition has been approved for use on the NHS. This picture is posed by models

A pill that could save the lives of thousands suffering from a common heart condition has been approved for use on the NHS.

Ivabradine slows heart rate and improves its pumping ability, with trial data showing it cuts deaths by at least 17 per cent.

Around one in five of the 900,000 Britons with heart failure – almost 200,000 patients – could benefit from treatment costing around £1.40 a day, say specialists.

The pill, which could also slash NHS costs by cutting hospital admissions by more than a quarter, will be available in three months.

The NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, says the drug will not only save lives, it will improve the quality of life for those with chronic heart failure.

It will be prescribed to patients whose condition is worsening despite the use of existing medication, or who cannot tolerate it.

Professor Martin Cowie, who was involved in running a major trial of 6,500 patients, said many who cannot take beta blockers, standard drugs used to reduce the heart rate, are likely to benefit.

The consultant cardiologist and specialist in heart failure at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said: ‘Heart failure is a very common problem and this is good news for a large number of patients.

‘We have results showing ivabradine not only improves symptoms and prevents disease progression, but also helps patients return to normal daily activities and increases their enjoyment of life.’

The guidance applies in England and Wales – the drug regulatory body in Scotland made a similar decision last week.

Heart specialists have previously estimated that prescribing ivabradine could save between 5,000 and 10,000 lives a year.

Ivabradine, also known as Procoralan, was licensed for angina five years ago and is taken by around 20,000 NHS patients.

More than 700,000 people over the age of 45 live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently.

Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it and an estimated 68,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles.
