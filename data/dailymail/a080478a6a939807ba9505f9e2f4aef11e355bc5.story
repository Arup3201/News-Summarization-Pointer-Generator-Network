A paleo diet guru who wrote a controversial cookbook with My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans has hit back at critics after it was revealed she performed voice-overs for junk food commercials.

In a statement released on Tuesday, food blogger Charlotte Carr argued she never 'personally' endorsed the products she spruiked in advertisements for Cadbury, Coca Cola and KFC.  

The revelations came just weeks after publisher Pan MacMillan dumped her controversial cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, after public health experts expressed alarm over a DIY baby formula recipe in the book.

'I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured,' Ms Carr said today about her decision to do voice-overs for the junk food brands. 

'If I'm telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush.'

In a statement, Ms Carr (pictured on stage) said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal

Ms Carr said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal.

She said she was talking to her agent about choosing 'roles that align more closely to my values'. 

Ms Carr, Mr Evans and nutritionist Helen Padarin are forging ahead with plans to independently publish their controversial cookbook in a digital format next month.

The book has copped heavy criticism from dietitians and health authorities, with the president of the Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA), Heather Yeatman, quoted saying 'a baby may die if this book goes ahead'.

The PHAA said its DIY baby milk formula, which is based on liver and bone broth formula, contained excessive amounts of Vitamin A. 

In an interview about the book with the That Paleo Show podcast, Ms Carr said there had been a 'censorship issue' with the recipe.

'I think we need to look at possibly where the comments have come from and who sponsors those organisations,' she said. 'It's a very, very big issue here. 

'It's also a censorship issue, you know? This has been promoted and printed I know it's well over 500,000 times because the (inaudible) manual has been printed that many times already. 

'And it's in many, many other books across the world.' 

'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers' will be published independently online. Pan MacMillan Australia will not publish the book after concerns were raised by health experts

'As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be', Ms Carr said in a statement

A spokesman for Pan Macmillan Australia would not comment on censorship claims. 

'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum – The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' he said in a statement. 

Public Health Association CEO Michael Moore told Daily Mail Australia the real issue was that specific diets discourage parents from breastfeeding.  

'If adults want to use a paleo diet, even though it's rated amongst the worst diets of the world, then so be it,' he said. 

'When you start talking about specific diets for infants... It discourages from breastfeeding and there's huge amounts of research around the world that breastfeeding's best.' 

A Department of Health spokeswoman said authorities recommend that parents use commercial infant formulas if an infant is not breastfed. 

She said the paleo formula is also concerning because it contains one-tenth of the calcium of breast milk, 879 per cent the sodium of breast milk, and 168 per cent the selenium of breast milk. 

'These are important nutrients to get right in the diets of babies,' the spokeswoman said. 

As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be. I often have little control over the jobs that are contracted to me as a voice over artist, like so many freelancers in my field. I am frequently presented with a package rather than specific clients that I can pick and choose from.

Over the years as I have become devoted to eating and living a specific way, due to the health concerns of my family, I have been working with my agent to choose roles that align more closely to my values. I have never "personally "endorsed any of these products since becoming a holistic health coach and baby food blogger. I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured. If Im telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush.

I originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any Mum in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas.

When you are told your child can not have these foods, sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start. Its a lonely place. This is why I created Bubba Yum Yum. A place of fun beautiful, delicious yummy food.

With love, X
