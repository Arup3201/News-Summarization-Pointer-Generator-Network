A funeral home in Arkansas has been shut down after dozens of bodies were found decomposing in over-stacked coolers with some left out in the open.

Inspector Leslie Stokes, who visited Arkansas Funeral Care in Jacksonville  last week, said she found one corpse 'half covered in a bed sheet that was saturated in bodily fluids.'

When she returned the next day, the body was still there, 'half wrapped in a soiled sheet, unrefrigerated,' she wrote in a report obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Stokes also reported seeing what she believed to be blood smeared on the walls of the prep room and cremation ashes mixed with garbage in a trash container. 

The Arkansas Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors suspended the licenses of the funeral home and its manager, LeRoy Wood, during an emergency hearing Wednesday.

The company - which charges up to $2,710 for burials - has been in business since 2006.

A woman who answered the funeral home's phone Friday said she couldn't take a message for Wood asking for a comment on the incident.

In a statement to the board Wood denied allegations, stating: 'We have the utmost respect, care and reverence for everyone's loved one we are privileged to serve.'

Wood has not been charged with breaking any laws, and authorities have not said if they are considering action.

In total, 31 bodies were removed from the funeral home.

They were transported to the state crime lab or Pulaski County's coroner's office.

Board staff members spent much of Thursday notifying the families of the deceased where the bodies had been taken so they could arrange to have the transferred to other funeral homes.

The board began investigating the funeral home after a former employee informed it in a January 12 letter that the business showed a 'blatant disregard for the dead.'

The investigation is ongoing.
