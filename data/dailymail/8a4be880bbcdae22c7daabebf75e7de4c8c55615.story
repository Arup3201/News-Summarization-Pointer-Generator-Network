A defiant grandmother staged a three-day sit-in at her son’s stately home to stop bailiffs repossessing it.

Stella Bond, 78, went without food or sleep for hour after hour in the library of the £2million property.

As a team of security guards took  it in shifts to watch her – ready  to lock up the house if she ventured outdoors – Mrs Bond remained ensconced in her armchair at Halswell House, near Bridgwater, Somerset.

Feisty: Mrs Bond was part of her son's property company in the 1990s, but retired five years ago

Halswell House owner Graham Bond bought the huge Somerset pile for £1.94m, but has been threatened with repossession after running into money trouble

And finally her resistance paid off 
when the bailiffs were withdrawn, giving her son Grahame more time to 
negotiate with US-owned Citi Private Banking.

Mr Bond, 48, a former estate agent, bought the 17-bedroom house for £1.94million in 2004.

He then spent £800,000 restoring  it 
as an upmarket wedding venue. But its future was placed in doubt when 
his property firm ran into financial difficulties.

The stand-off took place after representatives of the bank turned up unannounced to seek possession of the property.

Sit-in: Mrs Bond, 78, said she would not move from the house until the American bank proved they had the legal right to repossession

Mr Bond was not at home so his mother, a grandmother of four who lives in a converted stable block on the estate, stepped in.

She said: ‘I was told that they were down at the house and my son was not here, so I came down to see what they were doing.

‘They could not show me paperwork 
showing they had the right to take possession so I told them that they 
had no right to be here.

‘When they said, “Well, no one is living here”, I said, “I can if you want”.’

Mrs Bond, who has osteoporosis and 
suffered a stroke in 2006, took up her position in an armchair in the 
library by a window overlooking the estate so she ‘could see who was 
coming and going’ while a young carer remained by her side.

Surprised by her resistance, the bank 
called in a team of seven security guards to take it in turns to watch 
the property, prepared to seize it if Mrs Bond left.

She claimed that at one point during 
the sit-in she called the police when security guards blocked the door 
to the bathroom in an attempt to force her out of the mansion.

‘They were quite intimidating, but  I stayed put.

‘One man was very irritating. He thought he could move me by talking to me, but of course he couldn’t.’

Divorcee Mrs Bond, a former bookkeeper
who moved to Somerset when she was evacuated from London as a child 
during the Blitz, said she was determined not to back down and let the 
bank take the home her son had worked hard to restore.

‘It was very uncomfortable,’ she said.
‘I hardly ate a thing because I was very upset and anxious for them to 
go and I didn’t sleep a lot, but I’m a strong character.

‘It took a lot of hard work to restore
this house, it was so dilapidated. My son had a dream for a long time 
to put a stately home back together again. It is beautiful – I was not 
going to let it go.’

Security men from American firm Citi Private Banking attempted to repossess the 300-year-old stately home last week

She added: ‘I cannot keep very active as I have had a stroke which affects my walking, but I don’t sit in a chair all day.

‘I walk about as best as I can and do housework, cleaning, cooking. Anything I can do, I do it.’

Mrs Bond said she is fond of the 
house, but that her eight years on the estate was marred by an incident 
in 2009 when it turned out that a masked ball at the house had been 
arranged by a swingers’ group and degenerated into an orgy.

Her son, whose property company has 
gone into administration with debts totalling £11million, hopes to work 
with Citi Private Banking to find a way to secure the future of the 
property.

He is also in dispute with the bank 
over a five-bedroom mansion in Glebe Place, Chelsea, which he has rented
out to celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham.

He said: ‘You try to keep financial 
difficulties from your mother but she has said No, she wants to be 
involved and she has found  this quiet strength to absolutely take on my
case.’

Mr Bond added: ‘We have some real difficulties but Halswell is only closed temporarily.’
