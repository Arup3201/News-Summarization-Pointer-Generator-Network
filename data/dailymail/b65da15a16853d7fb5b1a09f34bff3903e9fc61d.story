A cage fighter who scooped a £1million Lotto prize is planning on buying a £150,000 Lamborghini - after nearly throwing out his winning ticket.

Gavin Davies, 29, only discovered he had won the Euromillions raffle 17 days after the draw was made.

The father-of-one had left the ticket in his car's glove box but discovered he was a winner when he checked it on Friday 13.

Winner: Cage fighter Gavin Davies has vowed to buy a Lamborghini Spyder similar to this one which Camelot lent him for the day after scooping £1million

He has vowed to act sensibly with his prize money - but has promised himself a Lamborghini Spyder LP560-4 capable of doing 201mph which will cost him in the region of £150,000.

Lottery operators Camelot borrowed one for the day so the martial arts expert could try it out for size.

Gavin, from Neath, South Wales, said: 'It's incredible - I've always wanted a Lamborghini and now I'm going to be purring around in one.

'I'm going to be the most popular man in town!'

The former forklift truck driver added that the winning ticket could easily have been thrown out by mistake.

'With my partner being a cleaning freak it could have ended up in the bin without being claimed if she'd cleaned my car,' he said.

It was thanks to an appeal in his local paper for a mystery missing millionaire to come forward that he began searching for what proved to be the winning ticket.

Gavin, who has had two professional cagefights, bought the ticket from a shop near his home on December 27 and left it in his Audi.

Double joy: Gavin Davies also celebrated his 22-year-old partner giving birth to their first child last month

He said: 'I've always said I'm going to be a millionaire one day - I spend about £25 every week on tickets.

'I've won small amounts a few times but because my partner is always cleaning up around the house they've gone unclaimed.

'This one was in the car and she'd been driving it around for a week - I'm lucky she didn't clean it out.'

Gavin became a father for the first time last month with his 22-year-old partner.

He added: 'Becoming a millionaire at any time is great but being 29 and having my first child it could not have come at a better time.'

He survived a near fatal motorbike crash in 2006 when he broke both his legs and was told he would never walk again.

But he proved them wrong and used his martial arts training to become a professional cage fighter - making a victorious debut in 2009.

However, the 29-year-old broke his shoulder in his second fight and was still injured when he won the lottery prize.

He said: 'I will continue to train but now I'm a millionaire with a baby I'm through with fighting professionally.

'I've hardly slept since I realised I'd won - I've just been lying in bed thinking how lucky I am.

'The Lamborghini is my one big purchase - I'm going to invest the rest and turn into £10m.'

A National Lottery spokesman said: 'We're delighted that Gavin has now come forward and we hope that he will enjoy the win - it's certainly a great way to start 2012.

'It would have been awful if the ticket-holder had missed out on this substantial and life-changing amount of money.

'We would like to remind all National Lottery players to check their tickets every time they play.'

Despite winning £1million Gavin will not be able to afford Lamborghini's most expensive supercar. The Italian Sesto Elemento costs around £1.9million.
