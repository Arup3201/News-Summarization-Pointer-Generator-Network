Mary Kidson was charged with child cruelty

Mary Kidson's daughter was eight when she started having problems at school.

'She'd never been a high achiever,' recalls Mary. 

'But it was as if she was going backwards: she was finding it harder to keep up in class and she got tired very easily. She complained of pains in her arms and legs and bad headaches.'

At first Mary, a former foundry manager for British Steel, thought it was a temporary blip. But her daughter got worse. Over the next five years there were frequent visits to doctors, yet time and again Mary was told there was nothing wrong - the tests all came back clear.

Eventually, three years ago, in desperation she visited Dr Thierry Hertoghe, an endocrinologist who runs a clinic in Brussels. He found her daughter lacked several important hormones, and prescribed replacements including a thyroid hormone.

The treatment worked wonders, says Mary, who now runs an online educational service for children with learning difficulties from her home in Herefordshire. 'My daughter was transformed. She became a bright and happy child.

'Within a month the headaches were gone and she'd got her energy back.'

Little did Mary know, however, that this breakthrough would lead to her being charged with child cruelty, and her daughter being taken from her.

Mary and her daughter had entered one of the most hotly disputed areas of medicine - the diagnosis and treatment of an underactive thyroid.

Known as hypothyroidism, the condition affects three million adults in the UK. It leads to a lack of the thyroid hormone, which helps regulate the metabolism, and causes symptoms such as low body temperature, fatigue, weight gain, depression, cold, muscle aches, headaches, and water retention.

The condition is detected with a blood test, and most of those affected are successfully treated with a form of thyroid hormone known as T4. But as the Mail has previously reported, patient groups and some experts claim the blood test for it is unreliable because it measures levels of only one thyroid hormone - and there are two, T4 and T3.

Campaigners believe as many as 300,000 adults and an unknown number of children are missed by standard tests. The problem, as they see it, is that NHS doctors are advised not to give hormone replacement to people with a 'normal' blood test even though they have typical symptoms of an underactive thyroid.

Indeed official advice is that prescribing hormones to these patients could cause long-term problems such as damage to the heart and bones. Instead, patients report being offered psychological counselling or are given a prescription for depression.

Her daughter lacked several important hormones, and was prescribed replacements

And this is where Mary's story turns dark. A year after Dr Hertoghe started prescribing the hormones, police and social workers suddenly arrived at her home and her weeping 14-year-old daughter was taken into care.

Mary believes the raid was triggered by a complaint by her ex-husband - her lawyer has a copy of a letter from a GP advising him to contact child protection services.

Mary was arrested on suspicion of child cruelty and last month appeared before Worcester Crown Court on a charge of 'unlawfully and maliciously administering a poison or other destructive and noxious thing' - in other words the hormones - with intent to endanger her daughter's life. The prosecution said the hormones could cause heart and bone problems and dismissed the Belgian doctor as a quack.

Last week the trial was stopped on the grounds there was no evidence for the charge. Mary is now free but her child - who cannot be named for legal reasons - is in a psychiatric clinic, following a breakdown.

This extraordinary story raises worrying questions about whether the full weight of the law should be used in disagreements between doctors and parents about how best to treat a child.

There are obvious echoes of the Ashya King case - the boy who was taken by his parents to Spain from Southampton General Hospital against the advice of his doctors. The parents wanted him to have a brain cancer treatment not available and they, too, were imprisoned.

Mary's ordeal started when her daughter was a toddler. 'She never babbled like normal babies and by three she still wasn't speaking,' says Mary. 'I asked my doctor about it several times but was told there was nothing wrong.'

The little girl was eventually diagnosed with severe oral and verbal dyspraxia - a developmental disorder that makes it hard to precisely control the mouth and tongue - and needed intensive therapy. But she was otherwise healthy and able to attend school.

Then, at eight, she began to develop a range of health problems. As well as chronic tiredness she started to put on weight, and by nine was officially obese. 'Every day she'd complain about bad headaches. Most mornings her fingers would be stiff and puffy.

'We went to see the GP and she got referred to various specialists such as a rheumatologist for the fingers, someone else for the headaches and a dietitian for the weight, and they all did tests. I think she may have had a thyroid test then, but they all came back negative.

'I think part of the problem was that nobody took an overview and looked at the pattern of symptoms. Each one was treated separately. For instance, she was 12 and still showing no signs of puberty, which made sense in light of the very low levels of oestrogen that Dr Hertoghe picked up on later, but it is also something that could contribute to tiredness.

'I knew what a healthy child was - John, her older brother, was sporty and had no problems. My daughter was different.'

At the end of 2011 the family GP said that if the paediatricians could find nothing wrong with her then she wasn't likely to, and there was nothing more she could do.

So Mary turned to the internet. 'As soon as I put in my daughter's symptoms, details of treatment with thyroid and other hormones started coming up,' she says.

'I learned that the NHS test for low thyroid could show you as having a healthy level when you didn't. That's because the test tells you how much of the version of the thyroid hormone known as T4 you have. But T4 has to be turned into the active form called T3, and some people have a problem converting T4 to T3.'

She also learned that European countries such as Germany and Belgium had lower thresholds for treating T4 deficiency.

Sheila Turner, who chairs the charity Thyroid Patient Advocacy says: 'While we estimate that there are about 100 doctors in the UK who are prepared to treat patients with symptoms but supposedly 'healthy' levels according to the blood test, most are not prepared to treat children in this situation for fear of legal proceedings.'

A sympathetic private doctor in the UK put Mary in touch with Dr Hertoghe in 2011 when her daughter was nearly 14. 'He ran blood tests that had not been done in the UK,' she says.

Dr Hertoghe told the Mail: 'As well as a low level of thyroid hormone, I found she was not making enough oestrogen or cortisol. Being short of any of these would be enough to make you feel very tired and explained other symptoms like low mood and constipation.'

He is critical of the official UK approach. 'There, doctors only treat thyroid deficiency when it reaches around 70 per cent, but in Europe many start to treat at the 25 per cent mark. British hormone specialists don't listen to what patients are telling them about their symptoms, they just tell them if they are deficient or not and that's it.'

Mary began treating her daughter with the hormones and some mineral and vitamin supplements prescribed by Dr Hertoghe. 'It all cost several thousand pounds - it was worth it.'

The hormones - a thyroid extract used for more than 100 years, oestrogen and cortisol - were the 'poison or other destructive and noxious thing' that formed the basis of the charge Mary was attempting to harm her daughter.

'If I was going to poison her there are lots of cheaper ways to do it,' says Mary wryly.

The transformation in her daughter was 'wonderful - she slept well. Even patches of eczema that would flare up disappeared. Her education got back on track'

And then suddenly it was all taken away from her.

'If only they had talked to me and the doctor involved first,' says Mary. 'Then we could have discussed it and worked out what was best for my daughter. If the NHS doctors had insisted that the hormones be stopped then I would have said 'OK, let's do it for three months and then reassess'.'

'Instead they did something very harmful to both of us.'

For their part, UK hormone experts are confident their tests are reliable. 'We have very robust methods for detecting if someone is hormone deficient in this country and the same diagnostic criteria apply to teenagers and adults,' says Dr Mark Vanderpump, endocrinologist and president of the British Thyroid Association.

'So if a patient has tested and been found not to need replacement, giving them unnecessary hormone treatment or supplements could do damage in the long term.

'A patient requires a diagnoses but sometimes there is no clear diagnoses and it is only possible to say that an endocrine cause has been excluded. It is difficult to explain reports of symptom benefit. Sometimes there may be a placebo effect which may only be temporary. In other patients, symptoms spontaneously improve with no intervention. Assessing each case individually and holistically is important.'
