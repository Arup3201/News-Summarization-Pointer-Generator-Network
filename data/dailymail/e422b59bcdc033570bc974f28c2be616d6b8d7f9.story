The Milky Way’s black hole is about to gobble up its first dinner, and astronomers are hoping to have front row seats when it happens.

A huge gas cloud, about three times the mass of Earth, is on course to collide with the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in March.

Astronomers expect the gas cloud will swing so close to the black hole that it will heat up to the point where it produces spectacular X-rays.

A huge gas cloud, about three times the mass of Earth, is on course to collide with the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in March. Pictured here is a simulation of how the gas cloud might appear after close approach to the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way

The gas cloud, dubbed G2, was first discovered by astronomers in Germany in 2011. They expected it to hit the black hole, called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star by astronomers), late last year.

That didn't happen, but the cloud continues to drift closer. Astronomers now predict that the impact will occur in the next few months.

When it does, the X-rays produced from the impact could help scientists understand how black holes eat matter and shed light on the evolution of galaxy.

Sagittarius A* lurks 26,000 light years 
away in the Milky Way's innermost region.

Even for a black hole, it is very dim - 
about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - 
making it something of a mystery.

Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy.

The
 collision will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint 
supermassive black holes feed.

They hope to understand these black holes don't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts
 in other galaxies.

The findings could shed light on how stars are formed, how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies.

‘Astronomers around the world are eagerly awaiting the first sign that this interaction has begun,’ said Jamie Kennea, a team member at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.

Scientists saw what they thought was a sign in April, when Nasa’s Swift telescope detected a powerful high-energy burst and a dramatic rise in the X-ray brightness of the Sagittarius A* region.

They were excited to discover the activity came from separate source very near the black hole:  a rare subclass of neutron star.

A neutron star is the crushed core of a star destroyed by a supernova explosion, packing the equivalent mass of a half-million Earths into a sphere no wider than Washington.

The neutron star, named SGR J1745-29, is a magnetar, meaning its magnetic field is thousands of times stronger than an average neutron star. Only 26 magnetars have been identified to date.

The discovery of SGR J1745-29 may aid scientists in their exploration of important properties of the Sagittarius A* black hole.

Black holes themselves are invisible and don't permit light to escape, the material falling into them shines in X-rays.

While astronomers expect to see a change in brightness, they don't know how dramatic it will be because they aren't sure exactly what the gaseous G2 object is.

If it's all gas, the region would glow in the X-ray band for years to come as the black hole slowly swallows the cloud.

Another possibility is that G2 could be shrouding an old star. If that's the case, the display would be less spectacular as Sagittarius A* slurped from the cloud while the star slipped by, dense enough to fight its grasp.

‘I would be delighted if Sagittarius A* suddenly became 10,000 times brighter. However it is possible that it will not react much—like a horse that won't drink when led to water,’ said Jon Miller, a University of Michigan associate professor of astronomy.

‘If Sagittarius A* consumes some of G2, we can learn about black holes accreting at low levels—sneaking midnight snacks. It is potentially a unique window into how most black holes in the present-day universe accrete.’
