This is the terrifying moment a rock climber severed his foot so badly in a 30m fall that he may need his leg amputated.

Sydney adventurer Daniel Bush, 27, broke both his ankles when he plunged from a cliff face in Australia's Blue Mountains.

The fall, which was captured on a helmet camera, left his right foot 'mangled beyond recognition' and his left 'dangling around on a bit of skin'.

Spiralling out of control: Mr Bush broke both his ankles so badly he may need one of his legs amputated

He said: 'I thought "my life is over". Then I stopped, I realised I was alive.'

He said he could only see shattered bone sticking out from the bottom of his left leg.

'Finally I stopped looked at my feet and screamed.'

He waited in agony at the foot of the cliff for three hours before being taken to hospital by a rescue team.

Doctors say there is a 40 per cent chance his leg may have to be amputated below the knee after it became badly infected, it was reported by ninemsn.

But Mr Bush says he cannot afford any procedure because his insurance claim was rejected.

He is now using appealing for funds through crowd-sourcing website Indiegogo to pay for the surgery or a prosthetic if his leg is removed.

Referring to the fall in April, he wrote: 'This time we decide to do the harder finish.

'(My climbing partner) went first and then belayed me up afterwards so I was on a top rope so if I fell I shouldn't have fallen far no more than one metre.

'Feeling a bit more confident being on a top rope and not leading I made a bigger move than I normally would have and missed...

'But the rope didn't go tight. I thought "that's it".'

He has so far raised $1,165 of his $10,000 target.
