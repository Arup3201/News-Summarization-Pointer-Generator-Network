Police are investigating a theory that the Victoria's Secret worker who suffered horrific acid burns to her face may have inflicted the injuries on herself.

Naomi Oni, 20, spent a month in a burns unit and has been left partially blinded from what she claimed was an unprovoked assault by a woman wearing an Islamic niqab.

The part-time model said she feared an unknown enemy was 'out to kill her' and wanted to die when she first saw the way her face had been disfigured.

Shocking: Naomi Oni was returning from a shift at Victoria's Secret in Stratford, when the attack happened

However, police are now investigating
whether the attack may have been self-inflicted after they seized her 
computer and found she had searched websites about acid attacks before 
she suffered her injuries.

She is believed to have researched 
Katie Piper, a model who became famous for her bravery after she had 
sulphuric acid thrown in her face by an ex-boyfriend in 2008.

Miss Oni said she is 'really upset' 
about the allegation. Her family have accused the police of not doing 
enough to catch the true perpetrator and wasting time by instead 
focusing on a 'crazy' line of enquiry.

Miss Oni was severely scarred on 
December 30 following a shift working at lingerie store Victoria's 
Secret at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, East London.

She said she was getting off a bus 
close to her home in Dagenham, Essex, at around 12.40am when she noticed
a woman in traditional Muslim clothing, which covered all but her eyes,
'coldly' staring at her from behind.

She then felt something being thrown 
at her, she added. 'Before I could feel it burning, I just knew it was 
acid. I thought, OK, someone is out to kill me.'

Miss Oni suffered horrific burns to 
her face, leg, arm and head. She lost her hair and eyelashes in the 
incident and has undergone several operations since.

Doctors had initially feared that she
would be permanently blinded but following intensive treatment at a 
specialist burns unit, she recovered sight in her left eye and partial 
sight in her right eye.

Miss Oni's story was first reported earlier this month after she went public in a bid to help police find her attacker.

She made an emotional appearance on ITV's This Morning, for a reported fee of Â£3,000.

'I don't want people to see me in 
public. I don't want to get the Tube or the bus. If I have to go to the 
hospital, I take a taxi,' she said. 'I have no clue why someone would do
this to me.'

Her case attracted much sympathy and top American cosmetic surgeon Cap Lesesne offered to operate on her for free.

The incident has caused considerable 
concern near her home and she and her mother have moved out temporarily 
for fear of further attacks.

Far right groups, such as the English Defence League, have used the attack to criticise Muslims.

By the time she appeared on 
television, police had reportedly sought to retrieve Miss Oni's laptop 
computer, which was handed over by her disabled mother, Marian Yalekhue.

It is believed she had searched 
websites relating to acid attacks and the story of Miss Piper, 29, who 
campaigns for victims of facial disfigurement. The pair were due to meet after Miss Oni's public appeal.

Officers have since questioned relatives about whether Miss Oni could have harmed herself.

Miss Oni said: 'The police haven't 
been able to find anyone. They even asked my aunt if I had done it to 
myself, which really upset me. Why would anyone do this to themselves?'

Friend Sheila Maclean said it was 
'innocuous' that Miss Oni may have watched a Channel 4 documentary about
Miss Piper on her computer, adding that this would simply have been due
to an interest in make-up.

Miss Oni's boyfriend Ato Owede, 23, 
said the police are 'concentrating on the wrong things' and 'are just 
coming to a silly conclusion'.

Police have yet to establish what kind of chemical was used in the attack. No arrests have been made.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said officers 'continue to follow a number of lines of enquiry'
