Prince Andrew's Range Rover received a parking ticket after the vehicle was left unattended on double yellow lines, it has emerged.

The 53-year-old Duke of York left his 4x4 in Mayfair, central London, while dining at private members' club LouLou's, when a ticket was placed on the vehicle by a warden last Friday evening.

But a personal protection officer who had stayed with the car and another vehicle saw that the ticket had been issued - and told the warden that officers had been with both vehicles.

Officers with royals are believed to be allowed to park on double yellow lines on security grounds.

The City of Westminster attendant then offered to remove the ticket. He had spotted the dark green car on double yellows and ticketed it just after 10pm last Friday while Andrew was inside the venue.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to
comment when approached by MailOnline and a Westminster City 
Council spokesman said the authority was looking into the details of what had happened.

Also spotted leaving the exclusive club on Friday night were actress Joan Collins, 80, her husband Percy Gibson, 68, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, 65 and his wife Madeleine Gurdon, 50.

It comes after an incident last Wednesday that saw Hillary Clinton pay a £40 fine on a credit card, after she was given a parking ticket on October 11 by a warden in Mayfair.

Photographs showed the 65-year-old former US secretary of state’s security staff getting into an argument with the warden after he issued her silver Mercedes with a ticket.

The Westminster warden put an £80 penalty notice on her car while she was attending an event at Chatham House - but the fine was halved because she paid within 14 days.

Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, were seen leaving LouLou’s shortly after each other in July.

The club is also known to be a favourite venue of Sarah’s daughter Princess Beatrice.

The Duchess fuelled speculation last month that she and Andrew might remarry, admitting: 'He is still my handsome prince.'

The 53-year-old, whose 10-year marriage to the Prince, with whom she has two daughters, ended in divorce in 1996, refused to deny rumours that the pair might get back together.

Instead she said: 'He'll always be my handsome prince. It's really lovely that we are still a family and the story has a happy ending all the time.'
