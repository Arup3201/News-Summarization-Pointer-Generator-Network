This river in northern India has become an isolated sanctuary teeming with wildlife thanks to centuries of urban legend, tragedies and bandits who terrified locals with horrendous acts of violence - but it may be undone in just a matter of years.

Nearby villagers had long believed that the Chambal River, and the infertile soil surrounding it, was cursed or too dangerous to traverse, making it largely a no-go zone.

Their fears allowed the area to become a haven for crocodiles, jackals, river dolphins and endangered birds, which lay small speckled eggs in the sand.

India's Chambal River is teeming with wildlife, including crocodiles, but it is facing growing environmental threats from humans

What makes the Chambal River so remarkable is that it thrived and remained essentially wild while the rest of the region developed into a deeply-polluted industrial belt.

The stench of industrial fumes fills the air in towns and tons of raw sewage is dumped every day into many rivers.

But the Chambal itself is now facing threats from humans like never before, raising fears about the fate of its creatures, including several varieties of birds and rare crocodile-like gharials, which can be found nowhere else on the planet.

Garbage is piling up, plastic bags blow through the ravines, increased farming has led to fertiliser and pesticide runoff, and factories, construction projects and stone quarries are dumping pollutants straight into the river or its tributaries.

Dr Rajiv Chauhan, a scientist with the India-based Society for Conservation of Nature, told the Associated Press: ‘In the old days, there weren't many people here to interfere with the river.

‘But with the bandits gone, the pressure on the river is now just too much.’

Beliefs that the river was unholy have faded and the last of the famed outlaws was killed by police in 2005 after their political patrons were driven out of office.

Development along the river is booming after the last of the bandits, who had enormous power in the region, were killed or driven away

For hundreds of years, bandits, who wielded enormous power, ruled the labyrinth of scrub-filled ravines and tiny villages along the river

The bandits held enormous power in the poverty-stricken and lawless region.

Now that they are gone, villagers regularly traverse the river with camels or boats ferrying people from one side to the other.

Yet the river is facing many environmental threats even though a 250-mile stretch was declared an official sanctuary nearly 40 years ago.

As people take advantage of cheap land and untapped resources, today’s biggest concerns include corruption, which is leading to deforestation and illegal sand mining for concrete production, and India’s undertrained and underfunded wildlife agencies. 

For years villagers were afraid to venture near the river because of the presence of bandits and the belief that it was unholy

One of the illegal sand mines can be found near the village of Bhopepura, where men can earn an attractive $15 a day (just under £10) to shovel sand for bosses who they claim have paid off local officials.

One of the labourers, Gopal, told the Associated Press: 'What is a sanctuary? What is a mammal? What is a bird? I don't have time to worry about these things.'

Hemruda Singh, an aristocrat with a crumbling family fort overlooking the river from Bhareh, has watched the transformation as dirt paths became paved roads, making villages easily accessible from the outside world.

He worries about the future of the region as corruption takes hold and people ignore the environment, adding: ‘We were so isolated for so long.’
