A crippling strike by Air France pilots continues despite company bosses offering to withdraw controversial plans to expand the low-cost Transavia brand in Europe.

With the costly strike now in its 11th day, Air France-KLM has called on pilots to return to work 'immediately' in exchange for its offer as it attempts to bring an end to a labour dispute that has grounded around half of the airline’s fleet.

But the pilots, who walked off the job to protest the expansion plans, have remained defiant and are making further demands.

Grounded: Air France says it has cancelled hundreds of flights since the pilots' strike began

In a statement issued Thursday morning, SNPL, the main pilots' union, said the strike is being ‘maintained’ for the time being, although negotiations were scheduled to resume in the afternoon after they broke off overnight.

The union said it had made further demands regarding workers' terms of employment under the no-frills Transavia brand within France, but that management had refused these.

The striking pilots have said they also want Air France pay and conditions to be extended to Transavia France pilots. 

On strike: Air France pilots continued their job action even though the airline has offered to scrap the expansion

Air France has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights since the pilots began their strike on 15 September at a cost of £16 million a day.

SNPL is accusing the airline of trying to move jobs to countries with lower taxes and cheaper labour, and they fear the expansion would erode their pay and conditions.

Air France-KLM had planned to develop Transavia with hubs in France, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe to compete with budget airlines.

It previously offered to delay the expansion until December in a bid to convince the pilots to return to work.

But the pilots threatened to extend the strike ‘indefinitely’, prompting the latest offer from airline bosses.

Facing mounting political pressure to make concessions, Air France-KLM said it proposed the immediate withdrawal of Transavia Europe, insisting there would be no outsourcing.

The statement said: ‘This proposition addresses the concerns of the social partners and brings a new guarantee that there will be no delocalisation (of jobs).’

Signed by Air France-KLM chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and Air France chief executive Frederic Gagey, the statement said there is ‘no longer any reason to strike.’ 

Meanwhile, Vereinigung Cockpit, the union representing Lufthansa pilots, has warned that they could also go on strike as talks over early retirement scheme stalled again Thursday.

The union has already held four strikes this year and a fifth could deliver more misery for European travellers.
