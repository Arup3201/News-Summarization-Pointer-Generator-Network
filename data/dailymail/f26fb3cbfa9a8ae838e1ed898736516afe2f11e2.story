Five year-old's injured from competing in baby cow rodeos, cars colliding with emus and cowboys suffering chaffed thighs from chaps is all part of a typical day inside one of the most isolated emergency rooms on earth.

A new documentary reveals the young and dedicated staff who choose to live in the outback to care for the colourful characters that wander through the doors of Broken Hill Base Hospital Emergency Department in the outback mining town hundreds of kilometres from the nearest capital city.

The resilient personalities, who are tough enough to call this harsh town home, which is located in far western NSW and 1,000km from Sydney, are used to limited access of medical resources that's comes with living in the middle of nowhere.

Dr Katy Ellenberger was a junior doctor in the emergency department for almost six months and learnt to embrace the solitude of living in a dusty town of just 18,000 people

Emergency services director, Dr Andrew Olesnicky, has been working in the emergency department for an impressive four years and there is only one other permanent staff member

Dr Katy Ellenberger was a junior doctor in the emergency department for almost six months and found the remote post an invaluable experience both professionally and personally.

'It takes some getting used to. It makes all of your normal relationships long distance relationships, which can be challenging,' she said.

'But you become closer to the people in the town as a result. It leads to a strong sense of community and mateship.

The born and bred city slicker, from Sydney's northern suburbs, learnt to embrace the solitude of living in a dusty town of just 18,000 people.

'In a way it's actually really lovely to be isolated, you realise how little you need to be happy and fulfilled,'

'It also didn't hurt that my internet shopping addiction could continue without a problem!'

The 27-year-old vows she is a better doctor thanks to her time in Broken Hill.

'Normally I would have layers of senior doctors above me in the hierarchy, but in Broken Hill there are fewer doctors, so you are moved up the ladder in terms of decision making and responsibility,' she said. 

'It gives you the chance to really challenge yourself, and the chance to directly help people.'

Many patients travel from hundreds of kilometres to receive emergency medical assistance in Broken Hill

Dr Leigh Golding says: 'working in Broken Hill can be a bit nervewracking… you can get some emergency situations that you would deal with in a different way if you had all the resources of a big hospital'

After working at the hospital for only six months, Dr Katy is considered a long-term employee because it is hard to keep staff on for longer than a few weeks at at time.

Emergency services director, Dr Andrew Olesnicky, has been working in the emergency department for an impressive four years and there is only one other permanent staff member.

'We can find people to fill holes in our roster but to get people to relocate out here for any period of time and consider themselves local is really difficult,' he said.

'There's a real value to having someone here for more than a few weeks.'

But the 37-year-old has long been considered a local of the rural town and he has seen it all.

One 'archetypal bush type patient' that first comes to his mind is a five-year-old girl who had broken her leg after being bucked off a calf while competing in a rodeo

'I don't know how hard they buck but I imagine they would be pretty cute to watch - she was dressed up in her cowgirl gear and it was cute as hell,' Dr Andrew said.

Dr Sandy Clarke says: 'emergency can be an adrenaline rush, it’s volatile, it’s unpredictable and that can be quite a buzz'

However, the orthopedic surgeon the little girl was about to be sent in Adelaide did not find the incident quite so endearing.

'He obviously didn't get the culture and said that was child abuse and insisted that I report the mother to children's services before he would accept care of this kid - which I didn't do because that's just ridiculous,' Dr Andrew said.

'You are dealing with the bridge between the bush outback culture and the - in inverted commas -civilised gentrified types in the big fishing village that is Adelaide.'

Dr Katy also experienced emergencies that would not be considered run-of-the-mill incidents on an emergency floor in the heart of the city.

'Normally in the city motor vehicle accidents involve two cars, and maybe a bike or motorcycle for variety, she said.

'In Broken Hill you get car versus emu, motorcycle versus kangaroo, and grey nomad caravan versus anything.'

The Royal Flying Doctors is a fundamental service for the hospital's emergency department

Peter Ballard Nurse unit manager says 'no two days are the same in the emergency department'

With Broken Hill hospital located more than 500km from the nearest city - Adelaide - the paramedics really have their work cut out for them

She went on to explain that the patients are some of most reasonable people she had met because they're used to having limited resources and therefore accepting of the restricted care provided. 

'I had a gentleman, with a previous history of chest pain, who came in with crushing chest pain for the last two days,' she said.

'But instead of calling an ambulance he got on his motorcycle, drove 200km, and walked in the front door. 

'It was reckless, but in a way I had to admire his stoicism.' 

This example perfectly depicts the calibre of the locals in and around Broken Hill.

'Overall they are grounded, self deprecating and tough, with an excellent sense of humour and a very colourful, creative vocabulary,' she said.   

Dr Andrew isn't moving to the big Smoke anytime soon: 'the people are lovely and the beer is cold.'

Dr Phillip Vitols, the only other permanent staff member, lived in Sydney before moving to Broken Hill over two and a half years ago: 'you don’t know what is going to come in and there is such a variety of presentation'

Another intriguing character to present himself in emergency was a 'real salt of the earth old codger' who had an interesting blue tinge to skin but had turned up for unrelated reasons.

'He was taking silver supplements for general health - that's how he had been self medicating for years - he figured or had read that it keeps the doctor away,' Dr Andrew said.

'We looked it up because no one had heard much about it - there wasn't a lot of evidence for it but I don't think it's particularly toxic, so we decided it wasn't a big deal.'

Dr Andrew doesn't look like moving to the big Smoke anytime soon.

'Every now and then you get to be a hero and save someone's life and that's a really good feeling,' he said. 

'Also the people are so welcoming and inviting - and the beer is cold.'
