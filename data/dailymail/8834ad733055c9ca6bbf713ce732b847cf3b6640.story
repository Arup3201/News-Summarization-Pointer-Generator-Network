As police officer and paramedics load Eric Garner's lifeless body onto a stretcher, New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo points at a woman recording the scene and waves.

Garner, whom Pantaleo is accusing of choking out just minutes earlier, was declared dead after arriving at a Staten Island hospital on Thursday.

The New York City Medical Examiner's office on Monday revealed that it has not yet been able to determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an underlying health issue. #

'The cause and manner of death are 
pending further studies, and no findings will be released until the 
investigation is complete,' a statement said.

Pantaleo, a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case.

It has also been revealed that the New York Police Department officer who was filmed putting Eric Garner is a chokehold has had two prior civil rights complaints against him. One resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an unlawful arrest.

Clowning for the camera: NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo waved as a bystander filmed the aftermath of Eric Garner's arrest. Pantaleo has been accused of applying a chokehold the Garner before he died

Eric Garner could be seen lifeless on the sidewalk, surrounded by cops and paramedics after he was choked out. He was declared dead after arriving at a nearby hospital

Video appears to show Pantaleo putting 
Garner is a chokehold - a move banned by the NYPD - as he tried to cuff 
the 43-year-old for illegally selling cigarettes on the street on Staten
 Island, New York, on Thursday. Garner can be heard gasping 'I can't breathe' before he passes out.

A second video that emerged this weekend was filmed after Garner was already unconscious. A woman recorded seven minutes of footage while police officer and paramedics mill around Garner's lifeless body before loading him onto a stretcher.

It is not clear whether Garner was unconscious at that point or merely dead. When one of the witnesses asks, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responds, 'Because he's breathing.'

The camera pans over to Pantaleo. He pointed at the camera - acknowledging he's on video and then waves.

'He got the nerve to wave,' the woman behind the camera says.

Garner's grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department 
officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested 
and thrown in jail.

'He should be in jail. No protective custody, either. Put in the (general) population,' Eric Snipes, 18, told the New York Daily News.

The medical examiner's office said it needs to do more testing before ruling on whether Eric Garner's death was caused by the chokehold

This isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him.

The
 first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren 
Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad 
daylight on a Staten Island street.

Rice is a convicted felon who had been released five months earlier after serving federal prison time on gun charges.

A
 lawsuit alleges that Pantaleo and another officer 'pulled down the 
plaintiffs' pants and underwear, and touched and searched their genital 
areas, or stood by while this was done in their presence.' The officers 
then took them to a station house and forced the men to 'to remove all of their clothing, squat, cough and lift their genitals.'

The lawsuit alleged that the search was illegal - based on a Pantaleo's false claim that he could see drugs in plain view in the car the men were driving.

All charges against the men were later dropped.

In January, the city settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay the men $15,000 each.

In
 the second case, based on an arrest in February 2012, alleges that 
Pantaleo searched and arrested Rylawn Walker on marijuana charges, even 
though he was 'committing no crime at that time and was not acting in a 
suspicious manner.'

Charges against Walker were also later dropped. That case is still pending.

On Sunday, four first responders have been placed on 'modified desk duty' following Garner's death.

The
 two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians work for Richmond 
University Medical Center in Staten Island, a FDNY source told 
MailOnline.

As part of 'modified desk duty,' the employees can't answer emergency calls.

Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a sermon in the wake of Garner's death at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Sunday. 

Sharpton
 contrasted the Staten Island man's death with the circumstances 
surrounding another man who died twenty years ago following an 
altercation with NYPD officers - but said 'there's a video this time.'
