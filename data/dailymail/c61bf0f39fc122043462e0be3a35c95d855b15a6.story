The wife of a sales manager who died when a surgeon botched a routine knee operation has been awarded a seven-figure payout.

Penny Belcuore, 36, fought back tears outside court as she described her family’s struggle to carry on without her husband, Luigi, at their side.

She has accused the surgeon involved – Professor James Richardson – of ‘playing God’ with her husband’s life.

Mr Belcuore, 43, who was known to 
friends as Louis, died three years ago after Professor Richardson 
injected him with an air bubble during surgery to correct a painful 
knee cartilage problem.

The bubble caused a massive embolism 
and led to Mr Belcuore having a fatal heart attack on the operating 
table. Four weeks later his wife discovered she was pregnant with their 
third child.

Yesterday, Mrs Belcuore said she was 
‘relieved’ to have been awarded the money, which would provide financial
security for her children Lydia, six, Sienna, five, and Louis, two, who
was named after his father.

She would not disclose the exact 
amount but it is understood to be at least £1million.

‘For the past 
three and a half years I have felt in a state of limbo, trying to find 
out exactly what happened and why Louis died suddenly during what should
have been a routine knee operation,’ she added.

‘Whilst I am grateful my children’s 
future is now at least financially secure, it remains an ongoing  
struggle to carry on without Louis by my side.’

She added that she would only ‘fully 
come to terms’ with what had happened if proper answers were given about
what happened that day and she was given proof the same errors would 
never be allowed to happen again.

Mr Belcuore was operated on at the 
Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital in 
Oswestry, Shropshire, in October 2009 after suffering chronic pain in 
his knee, which he felt every time he tried to lift his children.

He agreed to take part in a clinical 
trial testing new techniques for treating knee cartilage problems, 
during which stem cells were to be taken from his cartilage and applied 
to damaged areas in the hope they would regenerate.

Serious problems started, however, 
after Professor Richardson adapted a piece of equipment without 
authorisation.

Instead of using a plastic tube to spray a substance to 
help his blood clot, he used a needle, directing high-pressure air at 
the wound for several minutes to dry the blood.

The technique caused an air bubble to enter Mr Belcuore’s veins, which made his heart stop.

Mrs Belcuore is now waiting for the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service to rule on the treatment given to her husband.

The payout she received yesterday was 
approved at the High Court in Birmingham by His Honour Judge Robert Owen
QC after a full admission of liability by the hospital.

Mr Belcuore, a sales manager for 
American computer company Nvidia, lived with his wife and children near 
Studley, Warwickshire. He also left behind three sisters and elderly 
parents who live in Italy.

Solicitor Caroline Cross, representing
the hospital, said: ‘The Trust deeply regrets the tragic loss of Mr 
Belcuore’s life in 2009 and offers its sincere apologies to Mrs Belcuore
and her family and would like to wish them well for the future.’
