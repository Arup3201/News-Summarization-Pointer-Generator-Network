A German church pastor in Andreas Lubitz’s hometown insisted yesterday that the community stands by the killer co-pilot, as well as his family.

Pastor Michael Dietrich, from the Lutheran church in Montabaur, spoke out following the fatal crash  that claimed the lives of 150 people.

Among the dead in the French Alps disaster was 27-year-old Lubitz, who investigators say deliberately flew the plane into a mountain last Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Pope Francis yesterday remembered the dead as he opened solemn Holy Week services in front of some 70,000 faithful at the Vatican.

Mr Dietrich said: ‘For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy.’

He added: ‘The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this.’ 

The pastor added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance.

French prosecutors have not yet questioned the family ‘out of decency and respect for their pain’, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said.

Mr Dietrich said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he undertook religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, a part-time organist.

He added: ‘When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious. We had good conversations. I know her and her family.

'This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family.

'From what I've heard, there were no obvious signs that there is anything in the background that could lead to this.’

Meanwhile Francis prayed for those who died in the tragedy, at the end of Palm Sunday Mass outside St Peter's Basilica yesterday.

The 78-year-old pontiff cited in particular the 16 German students returning on Flight 4U9525 from an exchange trip to Spain. 

In addition, another pastor in Montabaur, Father Johannes Seemann, added that the community was grieving with the Lubitz family, reported Bild.

Co-pilot: The disaster killed 150 people, including Andreas Lubitz (above) who investigators say deliberately crashed the jet into the mountain

On guard: Police near the house where Lubitz lived in Montabaur - a community that is struggling to come to terms with the past week's events

Two wardens at his service asked God: ‘Have you forgotten the people who were sitting on the plane from Barcelona? Why did not you protect them?’

In Le Vernet, a town near the crash site, families and friends of those killed were still coming to terms with what had happened.

‘Members of the family shed tears as they went to see the site,’ said Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of Japanese passenger Junichi Sato who died in the crash.

‘It was particularly moving to see Mr Sato's father asking the leader of the Kempeitai (a Japanese military rescue team), with many tears in his eyes, for them to continue the search operation and for it to finish earlier even by just one day.

‘His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon.’

Among the tributes left near the crash site in France included one saying: ‘I thank you for everything. You have given me a wonderful life, full of beautiful things.’
