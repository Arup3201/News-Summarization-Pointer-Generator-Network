Sami Hyypia has been named the new Brighton manager, signing a three-year deal with the Championship club.

The 40-year-old former Liverpool defender was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen last season but guided them into a Champions League qualification position before leaving.

He said: 'I've held extensive talks with the chairman Tony Bloom and chief executive Paul Barber. I have looked at the club from top to bottom and I am very impressed by what I've seen at all levels.

Candidate: Sami Hyypia has managed in the Champions League with German side Bayer Leverkusen

Failure: Oscar Garcia quit Brighton following their play-off defeat against Derby

'I've seen 
the Amex Stadium and the club's new training ground and they are amongst
 the best I've seen anywhere in the world. I've also already met some of
 the key staff including Nathan Jones, the club's head of football David
 Burke, and Dr Helge Riepenhoff, head of medical and sports science, and
 I am very much looking forward to working with all of them.

'The
 chairman is ambitious and for me that is absolutely key. I am now 
looking forward to the challenge ahead and our aim is to take the club 
forward to the next level.'

Anglophile: Hyypia has an excellent knowledge of the English game due to his time spent playing for Liverpool

The
 Finn is still highly-regarded at Anfield where he spent 10 years as a 
player and is well connected in the British game and abroad.

Brighton had been talking to various candidates after Oscar Garcia resigned at the end of the season. Garcia, who held informal talks with Celtic has since returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Malky Mackay, Steve Clarke, Lyon coach Remi Garde, Tim Sherwood and Chris Hughton had all been considered at Brighton but many of those names were also pushing for the chance to speak to West Bromwich Albion and Southampton.

Hyypia was in charge of Leverkusen for two years and won 50 of his 92 games, losing 27.

A flurry of bets on Tuesday installed him as some bookmakersâ€™ favourite for the Brighton job.
