Teenage defender Timo Baumgartl was distraught after his gaffe gifted the third goal for Marco Reus on Friday night. 

Goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ilkay Guendogan, either side of Florian Klein's penalty for Stuttgart, put Juergen Klopp's side in the driving seat.

Germany international Reus, who missed much of the first half of the season through injury but extended his contract with the 2011 and 2012 champions earlier this month, added a third goal late on for the visitors as he scored for the third straight game.

Georg Niedermeier, left completely unmarked, cut the deficit in stoppage time but the hosts ran out of time in the search for an equaliser.

Victory lifted last season's runners-up to 25 points from 22 matches ahead of next week's Champions League last 16 first leg tie with Juventus and plunged 2007 champions Stuttgart deeper into crisis.

'At least it's nine points from three games. It's the maximum, you can't ask for more,' said Gundogan, who acknowledged that Dortmund wasn't yet fully clicking, before expressing sympathy for Stuttgart.

'We were bottom ourselves a couple of weeks ago. It's not a nice situation. The head is willing but the body doesn't respond,' Gundogan said.
