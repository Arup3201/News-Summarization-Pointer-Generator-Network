We all know looks are important in some jobs – but piloting a punt past the colleges of Cambridge isn’t the first that springs to mind.

So student Ben Cronin, 20, was shocked to be turned down for work with a punt hire firm because he was not good looking enough.

The first-year psychology student said being rejected was humiliating.

Ben Cronin, a 20-year-old psychology student, was left shocked after a punt tout told him he was not attractive enough to work in the river punting industry

The first-year student claims when he asked about employment opportunities, the punt chauffeur branded him 'not good-looking enough' for the role

‘I was with a group of university 
friends when two of us decided to enquire after punting jobs,’ he said. 
‘A friend and I approached a sales guy standing on the bridge.

‘He looked us up and down and replied in a bolshy manner, saying: “Sorry mate, you have to be good looking to do this job”.’

Mr Cronin, a student at Anglia Ruskin
University, had been punting four times before. He said that after the 
man’s remarks, he and his friends abandoned their plan to rent one of 
the traditional boats that afternoon.

Mr Cronin, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: ‘It felt like it was directed at me. It was so embarrassing, I just wanted to leave.

Mr Cronin from Lowestoft, Suffolk yesterday said he was already self-conscious about the way he looks but to hear he was unattractive from a stranger was very upsetting

‘All my friends were so shocked. The way he spoke to my friend and I has put us off wanting to punt on the river ever again.

‘It has made us feel really 
unconfident about how we look. I have low self-esteem issues anyway so 
to hear that from a stranger was even worse than hearing it from a 
friend.’

Mr Cronin made a complaint to punting
company Scudamore’s, the largest operating on the River Cam. The firm 
said it had launched an investigation, but did not recognise the 
description of the staff member.

General manager Rob Ingersent said: 
‘The alleged comment is not something we endorse, as we recruit purely 
on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.’

At peak times there are more than 200
punts on the River Cam, each carrying up to 12 people. A chauffeured 
one-hour tour costs £16 per person.

Mr Cronin had been punting four times before and had been keen to secure a job with a company for the next academic year

Mr Cronin quickly made a complaint to bosses at the Scudamore's punting company and an investigation was launched into the cruel remarks. But the firm said they do not recognise the description of the man as a member of their staff

The flat-bottomed boats, steered with a 10ft pole, were developed in the middle ages for use in very  shallow water.

They were introduced to Cambridge as pleasure craft a century ago, with F Scudamore opening his punt hire business in 1910.

Ben described the venomous puntsman as being tall, dark-haired and 'built for the female population.'

Rob Ingersent, general manager of Scudamore's said: 'The alleged comment is not something we endorse, as we recruit purely on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.'
