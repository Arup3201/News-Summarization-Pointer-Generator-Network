A kitesurfer is today fighting for his life after he was launched 100ft and slammed into a building after his equipment was caught by a freak gust of wind.

The unnamed man, in his early 30s, had just stepped out of the water when his kite suddenly filled with air, dragging him 30 metres along a beach and into a metal sign on the promenade.

He was then lifted 10ft into the air and thrown into a building before falling back down and landing on a metal hand rail and some dustbins.

Shocked members of the public and two beach lifeguards raced to his side and found him unconscious but breathing.

He was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries.

A spokesman for the RNLI, whose two lifeguards helped the victim, said: 'A male kitesurfer had just come out of the water when a gust of wind unexpectedly caught his kite.

'He was then picked up by the kite and dragged approximately 30 metres towards the promenade before hitting a blue beach information sign.

'He was then lifted 10ft and hit a building. From here he fell around 10ft on to hand rails and bins with enough force to break the bins' metal bracket.'

Rescue: The Coastguard helicopter flew the victim, who is yet to be named, to Southampton Hospital

The incident happened at 12.20pm yesterday in Poole Harbour, a popular watersports venue.

The RNLI spokesman added: 'The lifeguards carried out checks and found the patient was unconscious but breathing.

'They then administered oxygen, just as the ambulance arrived and took over control of the situation.

'A decision was made to call the coastguard helicopter due to the potential of the casualty having suffered a spinal injury following the incident.'

The kitesurfer was flown to Southampton General Hospital where his injuries were described as life-threatening.

Richard Gower, chairman of the British Kitesurfing Association, said: 'It was not that windy yesterday but there were squalls.

'The kites are very powerful but there is an emergency system to depower them. It seems this kitesurfer couldn't activate his for some reason.

'Accidents like this are fairly rare. They usually come about due to user error or other circumstances such as weather conditions.

'Unfortunately they often involve people who are fairly new to the sport.

'Most accidents within kitesurfing happen on land - they rarely happen on the water.

'When a kitesurfer is on the land it's the most critical time, and we do encourage everyone to look out for one another.'
