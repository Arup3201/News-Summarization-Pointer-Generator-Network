Forget the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos.

Animal lovers were treated to cute canines battling over a ball, keyboard-playing kitties and cheerleading penguins in yesterday's Puppy Bowl X as an adorable alternative to the Super Bowl.

Several hours before the epic showdown in New Jersey which ended with Seattle's victory, there was a much cuter - and four-legged - winner on Animal Planet.

Brittany Spaniel mix, Loren, scored a record four touchdowns to earn the Most Valuable Pup award in the pooch program, according to Bleacher Report.

The 14-week-old pup also put together a methodical march down the field that earned 'Drive of the Day' at New York's Geico Stadium.

On one particular scamper in the second half, Loren rumbled through the end zone and into the tunnel, reminiscent of Bo Jackson's 91-yard touchdown run against the Seattle Seahawks.

While some commentators were calling Loren the greatest of all time, others said Mandy, a  Dachshund/Hound mix, had been robbed. The17-week-old pooch tallied three touchdowns and three takeaways.

But it wasn't all about the dogs.

The cat participants refused to be outdone, with a performance by the legendary keyboard cat and a special appearance from a parachuting feline.

And of course, we can't forget the penguins from Columbus Zoo who cheered on the competitors.

'Puppy Bowl', an annual two-hour TV special that mimics a football game with canine players, made its debut eight years ago on Animal Planet.

Now in its tenth year, The Puppy Bowl continues to draw an increasing number of viewers, last year hitting 12.4 million, the night’s second most-viewed show and runner-up only to the human Super Bowl, The Daily Beast reported.

The popular program is the product of 100 hours of footage, all filmed in October in a miniature arena.

Last night's contest featured 66 puppies, 28 kittens and five penguins.

The puppies come from more than 20 shelters across the country and cats and dogs are all up for adoption.

'You’re not just adopting any dog; these ones are 
stars,' Melinda Toporoff, an executive producer and one of the creators 
of Puppy Bowl,' said.
