From creepy clowns to demonic serial killers, ‘possessed’ dolls have been the subject of many a horror film.

Now an animatronic life-sized doll with a scary face and even more frightening dance moves might give you nightmares.

The unnamed robotic dancer features in a New York-based art installation and gyrates to music while staring at onlookers - perhaps challenging the popular notion that gyrating and grinding are sexy dance moves.

Name: Unknown.

Location: David Zwirner Art Gallery, New York.

Dance Moves: Gyrating, grinding and swiveling plus expressive hand gestures demonstrating cutting-edge animatronics.

Eye contact: The doll uses facial recognition technology so its eyes can follow a viewer around the gallery.

Voice: It lip-syncs to songs by Robin Thicke and Lady Gaga and also says phrases using the voice of its creator - 33-year-old artist Jordan Wolfson.

Support: A metal pole fixed to a mirror lets the doll dance fluidly.

The doll was created by artist Jordan Wolfson with help from Spectral Motion effects studio in Los Angeles and is on display at the David Zwirner Art Gallery until April 19.

The humanoid’s movements are convincingly realistic and fluid and it is able to stay upright thanks to a metal pole connecting it to a mirror.

It uses facial recognition technology to 
seek out viewers in the gallery and stare at them with its terrifying 
green, masked face. It even follows people with its gaze if they move 
across the room.

It wears a skimpy white dress, boots and haunting witch-like mask with its geared shoulders plainly on view, while other body parts are convincingly realistic from a short distance away.

The supporting pole allows the exotic dancer to gyrate and swivel while staring at the reflections of onlookers, iO9 reported.

It is assumed that the doll follows people with its terrible eyes to make them feel uncomfortable if they are trying to view it as a sexual object.

The animatronic doll dances along to distorted versions of songs including Robin Thicke’s hit, Blurred Lines, which features a number of scantily clad girls dancing in white outfits in the controversial video.

However, the robot is far less glamorous as ‘she’ appears to be slightly grubby and has a mask capable of unnerving most adults.

Now that's pole dancing: The animatronic doll dances along to 
distorted versions of songs including Robin Thicke’s hit, Blurred Lines and is held upright by a metal pole secured to its abdomen that just out from the mirror. It is pictured performing different 'sexy' moves left and right its in grubby white dress

It also lip-syncs to songs by Lady Gaga and Paul Simon and challenges viewers to close their eyes and stop watching it, according to a report by Gallerist.

The doll’s deep voice is that of Wolfson’s and juxtaposes with the doll’s femininity and exotic dancer attire.

Its realistic hand gestures – a feature of cutting edge animatronics - make the experience of watching it move even more unnerving.

The 33-year-old artist told Blouinartinfo via iO9 that the work is not a comment on women but is simply designed to engage with art gallery visitors one-on-one.
