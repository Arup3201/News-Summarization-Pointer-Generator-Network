On-loan West Ham midfielder Alex Song has declared that West Ham can become one of English football's leading forces, and then Europe's, providing they follow Atletico Madrid's example.

The Hammers are flying high domestically this season, with Sam Allardyce's side sitting sixth in the Premier League - one point behind Manchester United in fourth and the final position Champions League spot.

And having joined the club on a season-long loan from Spanish giants Barcelona, the Camerooon international is adamant that the potential at the club means they can be challenging with the Premier League's established big sides within the next five to six years.

The 27-year-old cites the East London outfit's imminent move to London's Olympic stadium from their current Upton Park home in 2016 as a key reason, with the new venue playing a key part in being able to attract players to wanting to come and sign for the club.

'Maybe in the next five, six years one day West Ham will become one of the big clubs in England,' he said. 

'I think that the way that things are going at the moment it's very good. 

'For everyone who loves West Ham football club it's very, very important to look ahead because everyone is looking forward to moving into that [Olympic] Stadium and when we move it'll be unbelievable. 

'I think then West Ham can look towards playing in Europe and then attracting more players to sign.

'I genuinely believe West Ham can be one of the biggest clubs in England. When I played in Spain nobody thought Atletico Madrid could be like they are but today everybody sees how good they are.

Song, seen here competing with Manchester City's Jesus Navas, has proved to be a shrewd acquistion

'West Ham just have to learn from their example and try to be the same team. I think the future is great, because of the new stadium. 

'When we have a big stadium, new players will want to come especially with the way we're playing at the moment.

'If we've done very well at the end of the season, then more players will want to come. I just want to be happy, make the fans happy and just give them some happiness when they come to watch West Ham play every Saturday.'

Song has played an integral part in the club's early-season form with his eight Premier League performances having endeared him to the East London faithful.

The former Arsenal star added that he is happy in his new surroundings but won't comment on his future until the end of the season.

'I think my future at the moment is just to help the club. I'm very happy here, it's a privilege to be a West Ham player and I enjoy every day of that,' he said.

'The fans gave me a great welcome when I arrived and it's a family club. Every single day I come to training I have a big smile on my face with everyone and it's helped me settle on-the-pitch.

'I want to say thank you who has shown me goodwill. I just want to repay them back with my performances. 

'But for now I don't know what's happening [about my future] other than that I just want to play, help the club and then we'll see at the end of the season.'
