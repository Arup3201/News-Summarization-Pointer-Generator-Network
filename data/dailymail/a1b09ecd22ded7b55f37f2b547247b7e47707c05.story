Two men were killed when a car crashed into a bridge during a high-speed police chase through the heart of London.

Police said the Audi jumped a red light before clipping a van and then hurtling out of control into the wall of a bridge in Haringey, north London, at around 2am.

The 30-year-old driver of the Audi tried to run off, but was detained on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, suspicion of driving under the influence and possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Police and paramedics tried to save two critically injured men, who were both passengers in the Audi.

However, the men - both in their late twenties or early thirties - were pronounced dead at the scene.

The Audi driver was taken to hospital after his arrest, but his injuries are not believed to be serious. The van driver was also treated in hospital.

Traffic officers are investigating and officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards have been informed.

Several roads near the scene of the crash remained closed throughout the morning.

Eye-witness Erzem Salihi, 32, who saw the drama unfold from his bedroom window, said: 'My wife heard a bang and she woke me up. We looked out of the window and saw police trying to open the doors of the Audi.

Suspicious activity: Police say the incident began when officers on routine patrol became suspicious of a car

'They managed to open the door where the driver came out, the two police officers backed away. They looked like they were scared he was going to attack them.

'He ran around the back of the car, they caught him and wrestled him to the ground. He was very tall and wearing white joggers.

'After they arrested him they were trying to get the passengers out of the car.

'They opened the door on the right 
side and they dragged the lifeless body of a man out of it. One of the 
police officers pulled the man's clothes off and tried to give him CPR 
on the floor. But he was dead.

'Then they ran around to the left 
side and they pulled the person out and they tried to give him CPR until
the ambulance crews arrived.

Jeff Brown, 44, who rushed to the scene minutes after the crash, said: 'I heard a big bang, but there weren't any police sirens before that.

'We only heard sirens when the ambulance arrived.

'I went down to have a look and there were two bodies lying on the floor. It took them 45 minutes to cover the bodies up.

'There was a man lying on the floor. The police kept telling him 'don't move' but he kept trying to get up.'

Police said the incident began when officers on routine patrol became suspicious of a car.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Shortly before 2am, Islington officers on routine patrol in a police vehicle became suspicious of a car that appeared to make off at speed when passed in the opposite direction by police.

'After several minutes searching for the Audi, the officers sighted it several hundred metres away and they sought to catch up.

'The Audi was driven through a red light and a short time later it clipped a white van and subsequently collided with a bridge on Seven Sisters Road near to the junction with St Ann’s Road in Haringey.'

Police later said the passengers in the Audi were aged 33 and 38. Their next of kin have been informed of their deaths.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the circumstances surrounding the pursuit, Scotland Yard said.
