A father charged with causing his 15-month-old son's death by leaving the boy in a hot car has entered a plea.

Kyle Seitz of Ridgefield, Connecticut, entered a so-called Alford plea in which he didn't admit guilt but agreed the prosecution has enough evidence to convict him at trial. A guilty finding was entered on the record.

Authorities say the 37-year-old Seitz forgot to take his son, Benjamin, to day care on July 7 and unintentionally left him in the car for more than seven hours while he went to work. Temperatures that day hit the upper 80s.

Kyle Seitz (pictured in court in November) told police he accidentally left his 15-month-old son on the backseat of the car for the entire day on July 7. Sentencing is scheduled for April 9 with the crime carrying a maximum one-year sentence

Seitz drove his car three times with his toddler dead in the back seat after forgetting him when he went into work, prosecutors said at a hearing in November.

He went to lunch and back, then drove to his son's daycare  after work before finally realizing the 15-month-old was dead in his Jeep Cherokee.

The software programmer told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'.

After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure.

Seitz was charged with criminally negligent homicide. Seitz, who has two daughters, aged eight and six, has been free on bail.

Sentencing is scheduled for April 9. The crime carries a maximum one-year sentence.Â 

Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz, said she forgave her husband of 12 years, describing the Owl Computing Technologies employee as an 'amazing father'.

'I love my husband,' she told the Associated Press at the time. 'Of course I forgive him. But it doesn't mean that our lives aren't different now.

'So we have to move forward with a new different reality for us, and it's always going to be that way.'
