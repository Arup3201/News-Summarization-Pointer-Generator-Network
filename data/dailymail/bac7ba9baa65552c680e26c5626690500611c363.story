These are the playful dolphins with an unusual and fascinating talent for blowing perfect bubbles.

The cute creatures spend hours creating and chasing bubbles at their watery home in Oltremare aquatic park in Italy.

The clever pod of Bottlenose dolphins use their blowholes to create rings of air.

Intelligent: Dolphins sometimes make their own fun by blowing bubbles or creating rings which they then swim through

Playful: The Bottlenose dolphins were snapped performing at Oltremare aquatic theme park in Italy

Clever: Dolphins enjoy playing with other dolphins or anything else they can get their fins on

They then bite into the vortex rings so that they burst into individual bubbles which they dive through and chase to the surface.

The delightful shots were captured by Italian park creator and president, Leandro Stanzani, who has worked with dolphins for several decades.

The 63-year-old said they were extremely clever creatures which were able to amuse themselves by creating their own toys both in the wild and in captivity.

Social: The dolphins create vortex rings then bite them so they burst into a series of bubbles

Initiative: The dolphins can be taught to perform the trick but more often will learn to do it themselves

He said: 'Dolphins are very complex and social animals, they like to play alone, with other dolphins or indeed with whatever appears between their fins.

'When they don't have toys available they create their own. Air bubbles and air rings are their self-made toys.

'They create the shapes by blowing air rapidly under the surface of the water. Sometimes they form rings using the vortex created by their fast swim by injecting air into it.'

'They like to play with their own creations by biting them or following them with their sophisticated sonar system.

'The talent can be taught by trainers but more often than not one dolphin will learn to do it on its own and the others will copy it.'
