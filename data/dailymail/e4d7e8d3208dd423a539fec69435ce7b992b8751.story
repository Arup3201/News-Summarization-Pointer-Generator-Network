This singed letter addressed to Robert Moser bears German postage and the fateful words 'Luftschiff Hindenburg'... but the 23-year-old crew mechanic never had the chance to open it as the Zeppelin he was working on went down in flames in 1937.

Now, the British pensioner who owns the scorched piece of history is selling it - along with the rest of his 15 ton collection of wartime airship memorabilia, which includes several items found onboard the ill-fated Hindenburg.

David Kirch, 75, has nearly 600 items for sale this month - pictures, silverware and even newspaper billboards from the First World War.

His enormous collection of Zeppelin artefacts is being sold at Wallis and Wallis auctioneers in Lewes, East Sussex over four separate auctions and the entire lot is expected to reach £1million. The second auction will be held on July 25. The first one, held in March, made £220,000.

Other highlights from the collection 
include the passenger list and a burned ticket receipt from the Hindenburg, which 
caught fire after a transatlantic flight during its attempt to dock at 
the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

Of the 97 people on board, there were 35 fatalities, including one death among the ground crew.

The disaster shattered public confidence in the mode of transport and marked the end of the airship era.

It is thought the letter featuring burn marks could fetch more than £8,000.

The auction will also feature passenger lists from the Hindenburg the day of the disaster - May 6, 1937.

More unusual artefacts include bottles of beer and cocktail shakers in the shape of Zeppelins from onboard airships.

Even single stamps found on board some Zeppelins are expected to fetch £5,000 because of their rarity.

During World War I, the Zeppelin had been 
responsible for the first Blitz over England. And in 1937, the threat of
World War II was impending.

The Zeppelin was a wholly German 
product. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, born in 1838, had been inspired 
to develop his airship by the sight of tethered balloons being used as 
observation posts during the American Civil War.

After countless setbacks, he developed
his first successful airship in 1900  -  three years before Wilbur and 
Orville Wright achieved the world's first powered flight.

It was a tremendous feat which made 
the count a national icon. The German Kaiser hailed him as the greatest 
German of the 20th century. Over the next few years he improved on its 
design.

The individual hydrogen gas cells 
inside the airship's canvas envelope were better proofed against 
igniting the hydrogen with static electricity.

Aluminium alloy produced the strength 
of steel at one-third of the weight, and more powerful engines gave the 
airships an ever-increasing range.

And so Zeppelins became the first aerial passenger transport... later adapted for war.

A bronze medallion created by Tiffany
& Co to commemorate an expedition to the North Pole in 1926 in an 
airship will also be sold and is expected to reach £700.

It reads: ‘For the greatest discovery trip ever made and apparently for the greatest nonstop flight ever made.’

Mr Kirch, from Jersey, is believed to own the world’s biggest personal collection of airship memorabilia which he has collected over 40 years.

Property tycoon Mr Kirch has only given one interview about his collection and has declined to give any more information.

It is believed he originally intended to make a museum to show the public his collection, which started in 1968, before deciding to sell it at auction.

Mr Kirch is well known for donating much of his fortune to charity - gifting all residents over the age of 70 in Jersey £100 gift vouchers every year for the last five years.

He has said previously all the money from the sale will be donated to charity.

Head auctioneer Glenn Butler said: ‘Mr Kirch is a very wealthy man so he would ask people all over to keep an eye out for military memorabilia which is how he has this amazing collection.

‘We specialise in wartime collections so although the sale was offered to Christie's and Bonhams, we were able to negotiate a good deal because of our knowledge and contacts.

‘In the last auction, we had people bidding online from New Zealand, Australia, Germany - all over the world really.

‘It has been fascinating cataloguing the collection, I have learned so much about zeppelins.

‘We are very lucky to have it, although we have had to hire extra storage space.’

Post World War One, the Zeppelin was used by the upper-classes for travel with a ticket in 1936 costing $3,000 - equivalent to £32,000 today.

The Zeppelin was created by a German, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin born in 1838. He has seen tethered balloons being used as an observation post during the American Civil War.

Silently dropping death from the skies... Zeppelins attack Britain in WWI

By CHRISTOPHER HUDSON

By 1912, the airship was considered one of Germany's deadliest weapons.

The
British government was at a loss as to how to combat them. Shells 
attached to grappling hooks were envisaged, and aerial minefields of 
mines dangling from balloons on a cable, of which Winston Churchill 
remarked: 'Since Damocles there has been no such experiment.'

It
was actually a biplane, dropping a bomb on Tommy Terson's cabbage patch
in Dover, on Christmas Eve 1914, which represented the first attack on 
mainland Britain for centuries. But Zeppelins were not far behind.

Once
the kaiser had agreed to bombing raids on most of London except his 
cousin's royal palaces, the count's airships were over here with a 
vengeance, almost silently dropping death from the skies.

The
commander of the German Navy Zeppelin Fleet believed that Britain 
'could be overcome by means of airships through increasingly extensive 
destruction of cities, factory complexes, dockyards...' and a large 
number of his superiors believed him.

Many
Zeppelins carried incendiary bombs in the hope that they could start a 
general conflagration. This largely failed, because half of them failed 
to ignite and most of those that did could be easily doused.

But
one raid on the East End gutted several blocks of business premises, 
killing 22 people and causing half a million pounds worth of property 
damage.

(right) types of airship that highlight the size of the industry that 
came to an end before WWII

Until the middle of 1916, Britain 
could find no defence against Zeppelin bombers - they flew too high, and
any Royal Flying Corps planes which did chase them were shot down by 
the airships' banks of machine guns.

But
in mid-1916 the balance shifted, when a member of the Brock firework 
family invented explosive tracer bullets. The Germans fought back by 
inventing Zeppelins which could fly at 20,000ft.

These
super-craft encountered many problems, though  -  if they weren't 
destroyed by jet-stream winds, their crews were too frozen and 
de-oxygenated to man the controls.

By
the end of 1916, any hopes of using Zeppelins to turn London into a sea
of flame had dwindled. Not until the very end of World War I did the 
Germans begin building vast new Zeppelins, capable of carrying a 4,000kg
bomb-load.

By this time, 
America had entered the war  -  and the plan was to drop their deadly 
load over New York, thus paralysing the will of the Americans.

Thankfully, after thinking about the 
sure-to-be awful consequences for 24 hours, the German Chief of Naval 
Operations responded with the one word: Nein!

The
Zeppelin did not lose favour with their creators after World War I. In 
1919 one accomplished the first transatlantic crossing by flying from 
Edinburgh to New York against prevailing winds in 108 hours.

Returning
six days later, in 75 hours, it achieved the first double crossing, and
paved the way for international airship travel.

The
huge Graf Zeppelin, called after its inventor, was built in 1928. It 
carried passengers and cargo in perfect safety for one million miles, 
and seemed to represent the future of long-distance air travel.

Just
as with Concorde after it, the Zeppelin's reputation was destroyed by 
one tragic accident. It had been, like Concorde, the zenith in luxury 
travel. But it was doomed  -  the fate of the Hindenburg ensured the 
floating airship would always be synonymous with disaster.

But
even before the Hindenburg, question marks were being raised. Helium 
was non-flammable, yes, but helium-fuelled airships were also fragile 
and had a chequered history.

Of four American-built airships, two ditched in the sea and one was wrecked in violent winds.

The
British used rigid airships for passenger mail, but our airship 
programme came to an end after the appalling tragedy of R-101. France 
and Italy had similar experiences.

Yet
somehow the airship is too seductive a vision for people to give up on 
it. It floats like a butterfly as it travels quickly and silently to its
destination.

Helium-filled
airships such as the Stella Artois Star over London have yet to prove 
themselves in bad conditions. But the new generation of Zeppelins, built
in the city of Friedrichshafen, where the only truly successful giant 
airships have been made, may have put together that broken mould and 
given back travel's ultimate luxury.
