In of deadliest and most destructive storms in U.S. history, when the storm hit, photographer Randy Taylor, 59, lost more than 30 years worth of photography work.

The 59-year-old had photographed some of the biggest stories of the 20th Century (from Princess Diana’s pregnancy to Mick Jagger’s relationship with Jerry Hall), but when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, flooding Taylor’s entire storage facility, almost all of his work was destroyed.

But the Pulitzer Prize nominee salvaged a fraction of it by dipping hundreds of negatives in alcohol - resulting in them taking on a new psychedelic form.

He said: 'Alcohol kills mold so I came up with this process to literally dip the pictures in alcohol and immediately kill it off.

'It also froze the image at that moment in time. It was like taking a snapshot of the picture in that damaged state. 

Taylor said the entire experience has 'been a roller coaster of emotions.'

‘[It] started off as a sense of total loss and devastation. But ultimately this has been a wonderful experience; a lot of great art came out of it and I'm happy with what was saved.' 

Taylor, from New York, USA, has enjoyed an amazing career that has seen him cover some of the most dramatic events of the 20th and early 21st Century.

Some of his photographs include a photo of a soldier standing guard over Wall Street after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and a pregnant Princess Diana walking along a beach in the Bahamas.

It all began aged 22 when he snapped a photo of a shootout at the Iraqi Embassy in Paris in 1978.

He said: 'It was a pretty amazing moment. I had the honor of being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for that one.

'I then traveled around the world and I covered all kinds of major stories, celebrations, politicians, sporting events - it was an amazing era.

'I had done a number of travels with the Pope, I had covered the Olympics in Moscow, the World Cup in Argentina, and the invasion of Grenada.'

But his legacy of work was swiftly destroyed by Superstorm Sandy, which struck New York in October 2012, flooding the lockup where Taylor kept his archive.

When he eventually gained access two weeks later, he found virtually all of his 30,000 images either destroyed by water or mold.

He said: 'There was 300 square feet of storage and everything had been floating for a while and then had sunk down to the bottom.

'Thirty years of my life was down the drain and gone and it had a big impact on me.

'There was also the loss of my family's legacy. I was designated as the family archivist and told my family to give me their pictures so I could take care of them and restore them.'

To recover his work, Taylor first attempted to wash them, but found it washed away the emulsion leaving a blank negative.

He then dipped them in rubbing alcohol to clean off the mold and halt the deterioration.

It also resulted in giving them a new psychedelic appearance.

Randy said: 'It was a painstaking process of cutting the pictures out, dipping them in alcohol and setting them aside to dry.

'You didn't really see what was going to happen until after it truly dried.

'There was then a moment of transition from it being an entire loss to realizing that some of this could actually be quite artistic.'

Out of the 30,000 photos in his collection, Taylor was only able to save about 300.

More than 70 examples of his art will be displayed at the Stadthaus Ulm, in Ulm, Germany, from March 26.
