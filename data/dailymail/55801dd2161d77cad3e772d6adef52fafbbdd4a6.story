A 'Lingerie Legends' American Football match descended into chaos, when a mass brawl ensued between two sides in the Legends Football League.

Atlanta Steam and Jacksonville Breeze were competing in an Eastern Conference play-off match, when a Jacksonville player flung a filthy insult at an Atlanta lady during the post-match handshake. 

Before long both sets of players, along with coaches and officials, were involved in the melee, and one Jacksonville player even appears to strike an Atlanta player with their helmet.

Fighting words: A fight between the Atlanta Steam and Jacksonville Breeze began when a Breaze lady had some unkind words for the opposition during the post-game handshake

The free-for-all, caught on camera during what was supposed to be the traditional end-of-match handshakes, has since gone viral.

The match itself, in this case a side-note to what ensued afterwards, finished 14-20 in Atlanta Steam's favor. 

They will go on to face Chicago Bliss in the play-off final on September 6. 

The sport, originally titled the 'Lingerie Football League', was conceived in 2009, and in 2013 was re-branded to the current 'Legends Football League'.

Same difference: Legends League games are becoming as well known for their brawls as their are their bras

Spouting at the mouth: The Jacksonville player in jersey number 17 appeared to be one of the fight's instigators

Punch: Fists fly at the end of the match, and a mass brawl ensures

Take That: An Atlanta player doesn't hold back as she shoves her opponent in the face
