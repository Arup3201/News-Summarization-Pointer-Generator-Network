Space shuttle Endeavour returned to its California roots Thursday after a wistful cross-country journey that paid homage to NASA workers and former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her astronaut husband.

'That's my spaceship," said Endeavour's last commander, Mark Kelly, as the couple watched the shuttle loop over Tucson, Arizona.

Afterward, a 747 jet carrying Endeavour swooped out of the desert sky and glided down a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, 100 miles north of Los Angeles, not far from where the now-retired shuttle fleet was assembled.

The shuttle and jumbo jet take off 
again at sunrise Friday to make low, sweeping passes over Sacramento, 
San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Los Angeles.

Next stop: Los Angeles International 
Airport where Endeavour will be prepped for a slow ride on a special 
flatbed trailer through city streets next month to its final destination
as a museum showpiece.

Giffords was 'elated' and started 'hooting and hollering' as soon as she saw the shuttle emerge from behind the campus athletic center, said her former aide C.J. Karamargin.

Kelly said it recalled the memory of 
landing the shuttle, which was challenging because it doesn't use its 
engines as it returns to Earth.'Landing a space shuttle is not easy,' Kelly said. 'It doesn't glide very well.'

Joy: Giffords, who is still recovering from a 2011 attack in Tucson that nearly took her life, looks joyful as the shuttle flies overhead, while her husband looks pensive

Nothing but blue skies: Endeavour passed over Tucson; Mark Kelly, a former astronaut who commanded Endeavour's final mission to space in May 2011, said it was his spaceship

The
retired shuttle took off from a Houston airport Thursday morning, and 
will end up in Los Angeles after spending the night at Edwards Air Force
Base, 100 miles north of Los Angeles, then making one last low-flying 
pass around the state.

The 
stop in Tucson was requested by Kelly, the last person to command an 
Endeavour mission.

He and Giffords recently moved back to Tucson from 
Houston, where Giffords was recovering from serious injuries she 
suffered in a 2011 attack in which a gunman killed six people and 
wounded Giffords and 12 others.

Hundreds
gathered on the grass mall at the University of Arizona to catch a 
glimpse of the Endeavor.

They cheered and took photos as it crossed the 
blue sky.

Robert Thomas, a veterans hospital X-ray tech, was there with his wife, Marsha Colbert.

Colbert stood on a bench along a campus street taking pictures as Thomas and others whooped with joy. 'It's beautiful. Oh, my god,' Thomas said as it flew over.

Thursday's flyover gives NASA a chance to honour Giffords' legacy as a long-time advocate for American human spaceflight, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone told The Associated Press in an email.

She said no additional costs would be incurred by honoring Kelly's request.

Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday to watch the shuttle land in Houston for an overnight stay, an exciting but bittersweet moment for many residents who felt spurned that Space City wasn't chosen as the final home for one of the five retired shuttles.

'I think that it's the worst thing that they can do, rotten all the way,' said 84-year-old Mary Weiss, clinging to her walker just before Endeavour landed after flying low over Gulf Coast towns, New Orleans and then downtown Houston and its airports.

It's the ultimate piggyback ride, and scores have asked what it's like to haul a 170,000-pound shuttle. 'That's a tough thing to answer,' said pilot Jeff Moultrie, who will be in command when Endeavour performs an aerial tour over several California landmarks Friday. 'What do you tell somebody? It's different.'

The noise decibels louder inside the shuttle carrier aircraft compared with a commercial airliner because the interior is hollowed out to keep it as light as possible. There are no galleys, overhead bins or even air conditioning.

Pilots have to be hyper-vigilant about the weather because moisture can damage the shuttle's delicate tiles.

Built for American Airlines, NASA acquired the aircraft in 1974 and used it for test flights from Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert and ferry flights to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The four current NASA pilots who can operate the modified 747 are ex-military aviators who split their time flying other planes including zero-gravity aircraft and T-38 supersonic jets.

Space City, partly made famous by Tom 
Hanks when he uttered the line 'Houston, we have a problem' in the movie
'Apollo 13,' has long tied its fortune to a mix of oil and NASA.

Astronauts train in the humid, 
mosquito-ridden city, and many call it home years after they retire. The
Johnson Space Center and an adjacent museum hug Galveston Bay.

Houston's bid for a shuttle was rejected after the White House retired the fleet last summer to spend more time and money on reaching destinations, such as Mars and asteroids.

Instead, Houston got a replica that used to be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center.

'The one we're getting is a toy. An important toy, but a toy nonetheless,' said Scott Rush, 54, of Crystal Beach, Texas.

Still, people came out in droves Wednesday, waving American flags and toting space shuttle toys, cameras and cell phones.

Back-to-back delays in the ferry flight resulted in one day being cut from the Houston visit.

After landing, the Endeavour rolled slowly in front of the cheering crowd. It circled and preened like a runway model, giving awed spectators an opportunity to take pictures from a variety of angles.

'I want to go on it,' said 3-year-old Joshua Lee as he headed to the landing area with his mother and grandmother.

The shuttle took off after sunrise Thursday, riding piggyback on a jumbo jet.

It stopped at Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, before heading toward Tucson and then on to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, California.

After spending a night there, the shuttle will head to Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.

In mid-October, Endeavour will be transported down city streets to the California Science Center, its permanent home.

NASA still plays a large role in Houston, and astronaut Clayton Anderson, who lived on the International Space Station from June to November 2007, encouraged people to focus on a new era of space exploration.

'The shuttles are a wonderful legacy, a huge part of Houston, but now it's time to look to the future,' said Anderson, who lives in the Houston suburb of League City.

This is the last flight for a space shuttle.

Atlantis will remain at Kennedy for display, and Discovery already is at the Smithsonian Institution, parked at a hangar in Virginia since April.

Endeavour - the replacement for the destroyed Challenger shuttle - made its debut in 1992 and flew 25 times before it was retired. It logged 123 million miles in space and circled Earth nearly 4,700 times.
