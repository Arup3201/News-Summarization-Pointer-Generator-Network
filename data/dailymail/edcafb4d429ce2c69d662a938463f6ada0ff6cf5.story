Composed: Ho Lung walked up several flights of stairs to the emergency department and calmly asked to see a doctor

There was no need for Ho Lung to fill in a form explaining his problem when he arrived at a hospital emergency department.

The giant fruit knife buried into his skull was a bit of a give-away.

But staff were so shocked at his calm composure, he still had to bend down to prove it wasn't a joke.

Mr Lung walked into Yanji hospital's A&E, in Jilin province in northeast China, after climbing five flights of stairs because the lift was full.

He told receptionists: 'I'd like to see a doctor please.'

An emergency x-ray showed that the blade penetrated through his skull and into his brain but had missed any of the main blood vessels.

During a three-hour operation, doctors carefully removed the blade without apparently causing any significant damage.

After the man was bandaged he even asked if he could go home.

Asked how the knife had ended up in his head he declined to give details to doctors, saying: 'It's like this, I was playing a silly game with my friend and it went wrong and I ended up with a knife in the head. It was just a silly mistake and it could have happened to anybody.'

In the end doctors agreed to allow the man to discharge himself and he left together with the fruit knife after his wound had been bandaged, and after he told medics he promised to come back for a check-up.

Disbelief: The receptionist was so shocked that he had to bend down to prove that the embedded knife in his skull wasn't a joke

Lucky escape: Surgeons spent three hours carefully removing the blade from his brain. Remarkably it didn't sever any major blood vessels
