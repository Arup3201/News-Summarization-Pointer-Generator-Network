Cristiano Ronaldo has distanced himself from a proposed move to Manchester United.

As Real Madrid's four-goal hero in their victory over Elche, Ronaldo was happy to field questions about United and Jose Mourinho on Tuesday night. 

Ronaldo was asked about Chelsea manager Mourinho claiming their relationship was 'non-existent'.

The Portuguese forward had been linked with a return to Manchester United next summer

'It is an issue that is not important, what matters is Madrid,' replied Ronaldo. 'It is fine for me personally, I want to help this shirt. On these topics, it is not for me to speak out.'

Asked about rumours of a new bid from United for him, he said: 'They are all speculations about my future ... My future is Madrid. I'm happy this season is going well and my future, I will not speak about, it does not make sense..'

Speculation about Ronaldo's future ramped up after Real Madrid revealed debts of around £400million.

Louis van Gaal also spoke publicly about the player, insisting he would love to sign him, though also admitting he thought Madrid wouldn't sell him.

A package of around £120m would be needed to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, something which may be too much for United with the prospect of Radamel Falcao signing permanently next summer.

Ronaldo enjoyed six years at United before joining Real in a world record deal in 2009.
