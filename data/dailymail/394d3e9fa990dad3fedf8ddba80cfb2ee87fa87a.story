The MoJ refused to release the convicts' identities despite police appeals helping to track down recent absconded killer Michael Wheatley, aka the Skull Cracker

On-the-run killers and other criminals should not be publicly identified because it is ‘unfair’ on them, Government officials say.

To the fury of MPs and victims, the Ministry of Justice is withholding the identity of 18 convicts who have absconded from open jail to protect their privacy.

Officials say they have not even bothered to consider whether releasing the information is in the ‘public interest’ – despite the fact it could help to trace the fugitives.

They claim that, under Freedom of Information laws, there is a blanket ban on releasing the criminals’ identities because it is their own ‘personal data’.

Last night, senior Government sources said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling was furious with the decision, which was taken without his knowledge. He is now intending to over-rule his own department and publish a list of all on-the-run criminals within days.

MPs said the decision – revealed in response to an FOI request by the Mail – was ‘idiotic’ and put the public at added risk.

It came as yet another two convicts absconded from open jail, taking the total to six in just four days.

Ex-Tory justice minister Nick Herbert said: ‘It is simply not acceptable to say naming a criminal who has escaped from prison is a breach of their rights. Unless there is an operation reason, they should be identified. It runs completely contrary to common sense.’

In individual cases, police have successfully appealed for the public’s help in tracking down the on-the-run inmates.  

But the MoJ said that it was not prepared to release a comprehensive list, despite MPs pointing out that it could help to apprehend serious criminals. 

Hell’s Angel David Richards killed a 16-year-old boy with a monkey wrench in 1984. He absconded nine years ago but has never been publicly identified. The Mail understands he is among the 18 names on the list.  

Also on the list is a killer named Derek Passmore, who absconded last June.

Farcically, his identity was withheld from the Mail’s FOI request despite the fact that he featured on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme earlier this year.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The Ministry of Justice’s stance is idiotic. I’m almost embarrassed for them coming up with such tripe.  

‘Surely the public, for their own safety, is entitled to know which prisoners are on the run.’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is said to be furious with the response, and it is believed he will over-rule his own department and publish a full list within days

The row over on-the-run prisoners exploded earlier this month when notorious armed robber Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley absconded from an open prison in Kent while on temporary release.

Since then six more convicts – including two new cases revealed yesterday – have walked out of prison.

They include a violent robber dubbed the Scarborough Slasher, who was arrested yesterday after fleeing Hatfield Prison in Doncaster on Monday.

But police issued an appeal to help trace Anthony Peloe, 43, jailed for possessing firearms, and John Arnold, 30, a convicted robber, who have walked out of minimum security HMP Thorn Cross in Warrington, Cheshire.  

In a letter to the Mail, a spokesman for the National Offender Management Service’s Security Group justified the decision not to name the current batch of absconders.  

It said: ‘I can confirm that the department holds information that you have asked for, but in this case we will not be providing it to you as it is exempt from disclosure.

‘We will not be able to provide the names of absconders as we are not obliged... to provide information that is the personal information of another person if releasing would contravene any of the provisions in the Data Protection Act 1998.’

Mr Grayling has responded to the recent spate of on-the-runs by unveiling stricter rules on who can qualify for so-called Release on Temporary Licence.

He said that ‘with immediate effect’ prisoners will not be transferred to open conditions or allowed on temporary release if they have previously absconded.

Last night, an MoJ insider said: ‘Operationally the police have the responsibility for locating and apprehending absconders and MoJ releasing the names could undermine their efforts.

‘The police may be following intelligence leads and be close to apprehension only for the individual to see their name in the media and then disappear.

‘MoJ would likely be accused of undermining police efforts and face allegations that we had put the public at risk.’
