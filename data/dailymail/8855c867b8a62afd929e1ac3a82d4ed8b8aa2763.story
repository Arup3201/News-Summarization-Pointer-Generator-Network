The sperm of a proto-facist Italian soldier and poet has been used to reconstruct his DNA, the first time this technique has been used.

Scientists performed the reconstruction, which usually requires the exhumation of remains, by analysing a handkerchief belonging to soldier and poet Gabriele D’Annunzio 100 years ago.

It had been given by D’Annunzio to his lover, Countess Olga Levi Brunner, in 1916 with semen residue on it.

The handkerchief was analysed by police in Cagliari, Sardinia, along with a letter written by the countess and an ivory toothbrush.

They had been stored at the Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation in Lombardy, northern Italy.

D’Annunzio, born 12 March 1863, moved into the building in 1922 until his death on 1 March 1938. It was later turned into a museum.

Scientists believe that DNA evidence found at a crime scene could in the future be used to create mugshots of criminal suspects.

This is one potential use to emerge from a new research paper - Modeling 3D Facial Shape From DNA - published on last year in Plos Genetics.

In the article, a team of scientists explained how they were able to produce crude 3D models of faces simply from people's DNA samples.

‘We show that facial variation with regard to sex, ancestry, and genes can be systematically studied with our methods, allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces,’ the researchers wrote. 

Experts studied the artifacts using a crimescope light, which can observe objects in a variety of wavelengths.

This revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief, the DNA results of which were then compared with Federico d’Annunzio, the right-wing revolutionary’s great grandson. 

Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation chief Giordano Bruno Guerri joked that the experiment might open the door to the future cloning of historical figures even if their remains have been lost.

‘Nobody wants to clone D’Annunzio, but nobody knows what changes will take place in science and society,’ he said.

‘It’s good the DNA has been collected.’

AFP news agency described D’Annunzio as a ‘proto-fasciast warmonger’, with many saying his ideals were a forerunner to Italian fascism.

The Italian Carabinieri Forensic Department (shown) presented results of their research about an unpublished letter that Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) wrote on 15 July 1935. D'Annunzio's DNA has been extracted from a handkerchief stained with sperm that the poet gave a woman as a 'present' after having sex in 1916
