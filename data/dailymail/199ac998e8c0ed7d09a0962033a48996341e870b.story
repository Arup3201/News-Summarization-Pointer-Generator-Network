Overgrown with weeds and coated in cobwebs and dust, this tumbledown house and garage packed with rusty cars became a rotting monument to a by-gone age when it was abandoned by the owner.

Packed with rusty gadgets and gizmos, the remote property, dubbed the 'Hoarder's House', has remained largely untouched since its owner left around two decades ago.

Since then the former home, on the outskirts of Droitwich, Worcestershire, has been left to crumble, visited only by the odd vandal or thief, and adventurous urban photographers eager to catch a glimpse of the house where time stood still.

According to neighbours, owner David Godfrey Howells moved out of
the property several years after the death of wife Ida in 1990.

Since
he left the main house, filled with a number of obsolete appliances and dated mementoes from a bygone era, it has slowly turned to ruin, while his collection of cars has rusted away or been subjected to vandalism.

Despite
apparent efforts to deter trespassers - including signs warning of '24 
hour CCTV' and a boarded front gate - most of the once-desirable 
cars have been smashed beyond repair.

Back to nature: An eerie carpet of green moss and mould now covers this once impressive motor

Stuck record: An old record player has been left propped against this dilapidated car

Relics: An early model of a digital phone, and a crumpled board game based around Stanford University in California have been left to rot

The garage resembles something of a car graveyard, where classic models, including once pricey sports cars, have turned into battered shells over the years.

Reading matter: Old books have been scattered across the farmhouse, including the remains of an autobiography written by Falklands veteran Simon Weston

Kitchen nightmare: The house's kitchen is covered with rust and filled with old bottles, while what looks like old bedding has been dumped outside the property

The main house and its outbuildings also contain a range of fascinating relics from the past - although the buildings themselves are barely standing.

One photo shows a 1993 News of the World TV supplement featuring Gladiator 'Wolf' from the prime time Saturday night TV show on its covers - remarkably well-preserved despite years exposed to the elements.

Other mementoes dot the site, such as old tape and record players, an early digital phone and even an antiquated electric lawn mower.

Lost soul: This pair of battered old shoes were left behind by the house's former owner around 20 years ago

Neighbours are not sure exactly why 
Mr Howells left the property, which was believed to have once been a 
milk farm, to fall into ruin.

However,
they said the farm was regularly visited by local youths - who they 
believe are responsible for the majority of damage to the property.

'I think he moved on after Ida died so maybe he wanted to make a fresh start with the new woman?

'I'm surprised he just left all those things behind - especially the cars.

'Maybe the memories they held were too strong for him.

Plaything: This discarded toy Army vehicle was found littered alongside the crumbling

Tyred out: A lonely car tyre is slowly being taken over by vegetation

Hard work: It would take even the keenest gardener to clear up the overgrown grass surrounding the house with just this abandoned lawnmower

One neighbour said: 'From what I heard 
he upped and left quite quickly - I don't think they went that far but 
the house has been empty for years.

'It's a shame really because all these things could have gone to museums or been lovingly cared for by collectors.

'As it is, they've just been left to rot - or the local kids have smashed them up for a bit of fun.'

The neighbour believed Mr Howells still owned the property - inherited from his father Alfred - and was not aware it had ever been sold on.

Houses nearby in the remote Worcestershire countryside can fetch up to £500,000.

Forgotten: An old beer shandy bottle still contains some liquid, while this old leather boot has cracked and warped after exposure to the elements

Remnant: This aged hard hat sits on top of a mould-coated car

Sad song: It is not known if this toy guitar belonged to the owners of the house, or was left behind by a local teenage trespasser exploring the property
