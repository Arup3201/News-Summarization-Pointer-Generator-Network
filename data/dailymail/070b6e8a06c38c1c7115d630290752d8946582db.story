Sex Box, a salacious reality TV show in which contestants have sex in a box and then discuss their intimate exploits with a panel of experts is coming to U.S. television next year.

WE tv, the AMC Networks-owned channel whose shows include Braxton Family Values and Bridezillas has ordered nine hour-long episodes of the program which caused much controversy when it aired in the UK last year.

The dating show takes real-life couples and puts their most intimate moments under the microscope.

The couples don’t have sex on air, but rather in a soundproof box. Immediately afterward they talk about the experience with a panel of experts.

The concept is based on the work of sex therapists who encourage couples to have sex then talk about it immediately afterwards while their feelings are vivid.

‘Sex Box is one of the most unique and compelling show concepts we’ve ever seen, and we can’t wait to bring it to WE tv,’ said channel president Marc Juris.

‘Our featured couples will get a once-in-a-lifetime experience, while our viewers will get the kind of bold, break-through-the-clutter programming they increasingly associate with WE tv.’

When the show debuted on UK’s Channel 4 last October, producers claimed it was ‘pushing the boundaries of British television’, but critics branded it a cheap entertainment stunt

When the show debuted on UK’s Channel 4 last October, producers claimed it was ‘pushing the boundaries of British television’ and would prompt emotionally honest conversations about intimacy at a time when an alarming 30 per cent of online traffic is to porn sites.

The pilot episode attracted 906,000 viewers, but critics branded it a cheap entertainment stunt.

Many viewers took to Twitter to suggest the program was even worse than soft porn because it masquerades as a public service.

Mary Beadnell wrote: ‘What the hell have we become as human beings?’ while Miranda said: ‘So there’s a new show called Sex Box where people have sex on TV... sounds like porn to me.’

Others accused the broadcaster of cynically trying to boost ratings.

Production company Relativity Television acquired the rights to the series and pitched it to U.S. networks, reports The Hollywood Reporter.

Comedian Danielle Stewart will provide backstage commentary and interviews with the couples.

The experts dishing out advice are Dr. Fran Walfish, a leading Beverly Hills relationship psychotherapist who treats celebrity couples and L.A.’s poshest residents through her private practice; Dr. Chris Donaghue, a licensed clinical therapist and one of only 600 certified sex therapists in the world; and Florida pastor Dr. Yvonne Capehart, founder of Healed for Real, a healing and deliverance conference.
