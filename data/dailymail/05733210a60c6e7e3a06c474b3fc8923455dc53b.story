A judge in the James Bulger case sparked anger last night as she defended the release of one of his killers and cast doubt on links between watching child porn and carrying out sex abuse.

Jon Venables was set free last week after serving three years in jail for downloading horrific photos of sex assaults on children.

Baroness Butler-Sloss, who gave him and Robert Thompson lifelong secret identities after they committed one of Britain’s most notorious child murders, said he did not deserve to be locked up for ever.

And she denied there was evidence to show that paedophiles who seek out indecent images online also carry out physical assaults.

But her remarks have been criticised by James Bulger’s mother, while campaigners said there was a wealth of evidence that those who watch child abuse will go on to target children in real life, including the recently convicted murderers of April Jones and Tia Sharp.

Lady Butler-Sloss said she sympathised with the victim’s parents but added: ‘Venables was not killing children. He was engaged in watching child porn. It is a very nasty offence but a different one.

‘There is no evidence that those who watch child porn go ahead and do it. Not to my knowledge. There may be evidence but I have not come across it.’

She added: ‘When he has served his 
time, as long as the Parole Board think it is safe for him to be 
released, of course he should be released.

'He
 has his rights, even though he murdered many years ago little Jamie 
Bulger. He ought to be given a chance to live in the community.’

James’s
 mother Denise Fergus, 45, said last night: ‘Baroness Butler-Sloss 
obviously has no idea what a disgusting animal like Venables is capable 
of doing.

‘A
 lot of paedophiles start off by looking at porn on the internet and 
then they move on to rape and murder. Venables did it other way round. 
He murdered first, aged ten.

‘Baroness
 Butler-Sloss made the order that gives him his legal anonymity. She 
should hang her head in shame at what she enabled him to do, let alone 
pontificate about him deserving a second chance.’

And Tory MP Julian Brazier, a member of 
last year’s Parliamentary inquiry into online child protection, said he 
‘strongly disagreed’ with the former judge’s comments.

‘The evidence presented to the commission was overwhelming. There is ample evidence of correlation and we have seen an alarming rise in children who have become sexual predators,’ he said.

Lady Butler-Sloss, 79, was president of the Family Division of the High Court when in 2001 she granted the unprecedented lifelong anonymity order to the pair who, aged just ten, tortured James Bulger to death after snatching him in a Merseyside shopping centre.

The judge ruled that because of the risk of revenge attacks, the ‘uniquely notorious’ Venables and Thompson deserved protection when they were released after serving eight years in custody for the 1993 killing.

In 2010, Venables was put back behind bars after receiving a two-year sentence for possession and distribution of indecent images and videos. The Old Bailey heard that pictures of children as young as two were found on his computer.

Despite pleas from James Bulger’s parents, the authorities decided last week that Venables – now aged 29 – could be freed with a fourth new identity to help protect his anonymity.

Several academic studies and research by law enforcement agencies have found evidence of a link between child abuse images and sexual assaults.

Last year, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre said there was ‘compelling evidence’ that anyone in possession of abuse images should be seen as a threat to children.
