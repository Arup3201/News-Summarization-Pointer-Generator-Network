A grandfather lay for hours on the floor after a fall because ambulance staff were too busy to come to his aid.

Harold Dowers, 82, was forced to wait for two and a half hours because other emergency calls in the area were prioritised over his.

The former BT engineer lay in distress as workers at his care home tried their best to comfort him and keep him warm.

Yesterday, North West Ambulance Service launched an investigation over accusations they put the pensioner’s life at risk with the delay.

Harold Dowers, 82, was forced to stay on the floor of the Marple Lodge care home in Stockport for two-and-a-half hours while waiting for an ambulance

Mr Dowers’ daughter Jennifer Holt, 50, submitted a formal complaint demanding to know why he was not seen sooner.

She
said: ‘I want to know how they know he was wasn’t priority. In the 
position he was in he could have easily died just lay on the floor.

‘I’m not someone that makes a complaint easily, I think I’m just so shocked by what happened that I want to know why.’

Mr Dowers, who has dementia, had a fall at Marple Lodge care home in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

Staff
phoned 999 first at 12.22am and then two more times to chase the 
ambulance up but were told the crews were busy on priority calls. It 
finally arrived at 02.50am.

In the meantime, they were left powerless to move him because they were unable to tell whether he had broken any bones.

Instead, they had to keep him on the floor, covering him with blankets and comforting him as best they could.

Care home manager Fay Cameron says ambulances normally arrive at Marple Lodge (pictured) within five minutes of being called

Mr Dowers, who did not suffer any serious injuries in the fall, was kept in at Stepping Hill Hospital overnight.

Mrs Holt, a florist, rushed to his side in hospital when she was called at 3am and told what had happened.

She
said: ‘I asked what time he had fallen and they said about 12-ish and I
was shocked because that was two-and-a-half hours earlier.

‘I
was concerned for him at that point he was shouting out and we didn’t 
know how he was. We didn’t know if he was in pain or discomfort or if he
was hurt.

‘I was disgusted with the wait and I would be no matter who it was for regardless of their age of reason for calling.’

Her father has now been discharged and is back at Marple Lodge.

The ambulance services said an investigation has been launched into the incident

Care home manager Fay Cameron said ambulances normally arrive at Marple Lodge within five minutes of calling them.

She said it was the policy of the home not to move people who had suffered a fall before medical experts had examined them.

She added: ‘My staff made three calls that night and were told the crews were having a busy night.

‘His
condition could have deteriorated in the time it took for the ambulance
to arrive and could have died within that length of time.

‘They did not know what was wrong with him. It was distressing for him and he had no understanding of what was going on.

‘At
the end of the day someone’s life was put at risk. Two and a half hours
was a long time and I do not think it is good enough.’

The
NWAS said an investigation has been launched into the incident and that
the ambulance are prioritised based on ‘medical need.’

A spokesman said: ‘We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing for the patient and their family.

‘When
received, all 999 calls are categorised within the control rooms, based
on the information given by the caller, to ensure that patients are 
prioritised on the basis of their medical need.

‘Although
the service strives to attend to every patient as quickly as possible, 
those with serious, life threatening conditions require a more urgent 
response.’
