It has already wrecked hundreds of homes - with thousands of people warned to prepare for more flooding.

Now, the rising River Thames has almost destroyed the country manor of pop star George Michael.

Floodwater can be seen surrounding the detached property - lapping against its front door and garden wall.

Star: It is unknown whether George - who is due to release his new single, Let Her Down Easy, on March 17 - was at home when the floodwater struck. Above, the singer performs at the Stade de France stadium in Paris

However, it is yet to flow over the wall surrounding the manor in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire - with sandbags also positioned outside the property.

Today, a woman - believed to be one of George's sisters - could be seen standing at one of the manor's windows.

With a phone held against her ear, she looked downcast as she glanced out at the vast flooding.

Crisis: It comes as more than 1,500 members of Britain's armed forces have been put on standby to help communities wrecked by flooding. Above, water surrounds properties in Moorland on the Somerset Levels

Help: More than 1,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in the South West and Thames Valley. Above, a family is evacuated by boat from floodwater in Wraysbury after the River Thames burst its banks

It comes as more than 1,500 members of Britain's armed forces have been put on standby to help communities wrecked by flooding - with 1,000 people forced to leave their homes in the South West and Thames Valley.

And things are only expected to get worse - with 1.5in of rain expected by Friday night.

Today, Prime Minister David Cameron insisted the Government was in for the 'long haul' to ensure the country recovers from the devastating weather battering the country.

He said it was 'going to take time before we get things back to normal' - adding that ministers would do everything possible.

The Prime Minister is continuing a two-day tour of sites in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset battered by storms, high winds and flood waters.

Today, he visited Dawlish, where sea defences and the railway line was destroyed by huge waves last week.

He said: 'It is a huge challenge and we have had the wettest start to a year for 250 years, some of the most extreme weather we have seen in our country in decades.

'We are in for the long haul but the Government will do everything it can to coordinate the nation’s resources.

'Flood tourists' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) and Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) have also offered their support to flood victims - leading some angry, stricken communities to brand them 'flood tourists'

'If money needs to be spent, it will be spent; if resources are required we will provide them; if the military can help, they will be there. We must do everything but it will take time to put these things right.'

And Cameron is not the only senior politician to offer his support to flood victims - with Labour leader Ed Miliband and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also pictured touring stricken communities.

However, their visits have triggered an angry repsonse from flood victims - with some labelling the politicans 'flood tourists'.

By this evening, more than 80,000 people had signed the Mail's petition to Cameron to 'divert some of the £11billion a year spent on 
overseas aid to ease the suffering of British flood victims, and to 
build and maintain flood defences to prevent a repetition of this 
crisis'.
