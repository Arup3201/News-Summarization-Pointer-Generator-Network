It's the one day of the year when receiving a dozen red roses or a bunch of her favourite flowers as a romantic surprise is an expectation for any woman with a man in her life.

So it's little wonder that florists in Amsterdam are working flat out to ensure that the UK's florists are well stocked in time for Valentine's Day and that millions of men spend the most romantic day on the calendar smelling of roses and not stuck in the doghouse.

An army of 4,000 workers at FloraHolland have been racing around making final preparations to ship a staggering £17million worth to the UK alone - that's an incredible 32million flowers and plants.

Tulips from Amsterdam: Staff at FloraHolland in Aalsmeer race around in an attempt to make sure that UK florists are stocked up with a variety of flowers in time for Valentine's Day

Coming up smelling of roses: Just a handful of more than 32million flowers that will be shipped from FloraHolland to the UK in time for February 14

Chaotic operation: FloraHolland, the world's biggest flower auction in Aalsmeer, expects sales to jump leading up to Valentine's Day

Big business: Crates of roses are taken to large trucks to be shipped to the UK - one of the company's largest exporters

But the trucks carrying that special cargo could now face an uncertain journey with snow blanketing much of the UK.

In total the Aalsmeer auction house will sell 100million roses, the same number of tulips and more than 100 million other flowers in time for February 14.

Many of the specialist roses and tulips are grown nearby in Holland while many others are flown in from Kenya before reaching Aalsmeer.

Around 1,200 people are employed on FloraHolland's auction room floor alone with hundreds chaotically racing around on tractors and scooters.

There are four amphitheatres full of buyers, who bid on the blooms using laptops as they pass through the auction room.

Flowers are sold using an 'auction clock', with prices starting high and dropping, with the current price displayed on a giant clock-type face along with information about the lot.

Getting ready for the big day: Flowers line up alongside bicycles which belong to some of the 4,000 strong army of staff employed by the company

Giant warehouse: The huge FloraHolland factory is the equivalent of 400 football pitches in size

Flower power: A worker at the warehouse drags a giant train of crates through the factory for auction

Quick workers: Around 1,200 people are employed on FloraHolland's auction room floor alone with hundreds chaotically racing around on tractors and scooters

Buyers press a button when they wish to stop the auction.

The buyer who has hit the button is offering the highest price and therefore wins the lot.

The giant warehouse is a staggering 2.6million square metres in size, the equivalent of 400 football fields.

FloraHolland ships over 12.5billion items to customers a year and stocks a variety of 20,000 different plants and flowers.

The company has been showcasing its Valentine's products for more than a month.

Roaring trade: FloraHolland ships some 12.5billion items every year

Busy: Valentine's Day is the firms busiest time of the year by far

Auction: Buyers sit in giant amphitheatre style auction rooms where prices start high and are allowed to fall before a bidder presses a button to stop it

Ready to be shipped: In total the Aalsmeer auction house will sell 100million roses, the same number of tulips and more than 100 million other flowers in time for February 14
