Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’

To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball.

And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over.

The Murata Cheerleaders (pictured) were built by Japanese-based Murata Manufacturing. Each robot balances - similar to Weebles - and perform high-precision routines thanks to real-time position measurement technology

The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing.

Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move.

They remain upright due to advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles.

Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control systems that prevent cars from skidding.

They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles.

Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding.

Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark.

A Murata employee demonstrates how the cheerleaders work. The robots will be showcased at the upcoming CEATEC 2014 event 7 to 11 October 

And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space.

In collaboration with researchers from Matsuno Lab at Kyoto University, Murata has also developed an advanced group control technology that allows 10 robots to perform in synchronisation without colliding.

Each robot's location is communicated using a wireless communication network, and controlled through a specially developed program.

This same technology may someday be used to realise safer and more efficient vehicle and transportation systems, said the firm.

‘The Murata Cheerleaders showcase the ability of electronics to enrich our lives,’ said Yuichi Kojima, senior vice president and deputy director of Murata's Technology and Business Development Unit. 

‘We believe the wireless communication of sensor data could become a core infrastructure for the advanced integration of people and objects in smart societies.’

‘We developed the Murata Cheerleaders to demonstrate our electronics technologies,’ said Koichi Yoshikawa, senior manager of corporate communications.

'Our hope is that the Murata Cheerleaders will inspire new discoveries by young innovators and put smiles on the faces of people worldwide.’

The Murata Cheerleaders will be showcased at the upcoming CEATEC 2014 scheduled from October 7 to 11 in Tokyo.

Weebles are Hasbro toys that launched in 1971. A modern-day version is pictured. Tipping the egg-shaped toy caused a weight in the base to lift off the ground. Once released, gravitational force brought the Weeble back into an upright position
