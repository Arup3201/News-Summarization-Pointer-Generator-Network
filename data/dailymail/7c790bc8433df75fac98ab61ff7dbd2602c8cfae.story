A former U.S. soldier who survived eight months on tour in Iraq lost both legs in an accident back home while he was helping an injured motorist.

Army specialist Jeremy Gilley, 27, of Palermo, Maine, watched in agony as his legs were crushed by a minivan in Augusta, Maine, two months ago.

He had pulled over to help another driver, but a 16-year-old on the road didn’t see the accident and struck the driver’s pickup truck and Mr Gilley.

‘I looked down,’ Mr Gilley told the Morning Sentinel. ‘I knew it wasn't going to be good. I knew I wasn't going to keep my legs.’

His legs were crushed between the two vehicles, but he is expected to walk again with prosthetic legs once his own legs have healed.

Mr Gilley was driving home after picking up his cousin Julia Morrison from Portland, Maine, and pulled over when he saw the injured motorist.

He realised that the driver was Christopher Bizier, 31, an old acquaintance from Erskine Academy high school in South China, Maine.

‘I grabbed under his arms and I heard screeching tyres’ he told the Morning Sentinel. ‘I looked over my shoulder and there were headlights.’

He remained conscious after the crash and told his cousin and the 16-year-old, who stopped, to wrap a tourniquet around each of his legs.

Mr Gilley, who returned from duty in Iraq in 2009, was flown to hospital by helicopter and admitted he thought he might have died.

His girlfriend Rachael Turcotte realised something was wrong when he failed to contact her and she soon heard what happened from his sister.

Mr Gilley received 12 pints of blood in hospital. While doctors managed to save his left knee, he lost his right, reported the Morning Sentinel.

‘This is going to slow him down, but it’s not going to hold him down,’ his aunt Dottie Gilley told the Bangor Daily News. ‘It won’t stop Jeremy.’

Veteran groups are putting on two benefit nights in Maine for him and organisers said they have already been amazed by the response.

‘I'm not going to hold it against him,’ Mr Gilley said of the driver who hit him in December. ‘If you did that to someone, you'd feel pretty bad.’
