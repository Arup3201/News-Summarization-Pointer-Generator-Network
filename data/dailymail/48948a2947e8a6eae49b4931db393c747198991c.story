They became synonymous with Bradley Wiggins' rising stardom in a summer when he became the first British man to win the Tour de France and followed it up with Olympic gold.

But now 'Wiggo' has shaved off his famous sideburns in a bid to make himself less recognisable to fans.

He has admitted that he was often mobbed because of his distinctive mod haircut and had grown tired of all the attention following his remarkable run of success.

Famous facial hair gone: British cycling legend Bradley Wiggins has shaved off his sideburns which has become synonymous with his rising sport stardom, winning the Tour de France and seven Olympic medals

The 32-year-old told the Sun: ‘They were too recognisable, it was getting a bit much. Now I can put on a hat and no one knows who I am.’

His muttonchops became famous as hundreds of fans lined London’s streets wearing their own mock sideburns as he raced to a gold medal at this summer’s Olympics, becoming Britain’s greatest ever Olympian as he took his overall tally to seven medals, including four golds.

While he does have plans to win next 
year’s Giro d’Italia in Italy, fans hoping to see a repeat of Wiggins’ 
heroics in next year’s Tour de France will be disappointed. 

Speaking at a presentation in Paris in October, Wiggins said that he was unlikely to defend the yellow jersey.

Wiggins
said that he was more likely to support fellow British cyclist Chris 
Froome but joked that his teammate might need to grow some more facial 
hair for inspiration.

Pass on the Tour: Wiggins, in the leader's yellow jersey in the Tour de France final stage this year, says he is unlikely to defend his title but joked his teammate Chris Froome might need to grow some facial hair for inspiration

He said: ‘It was always about winning one Tour and then deal with what comes next.

‘It’s more than likely I’ll ride in a supporting role for Chris. I just want to be in a successful team and if that’s Chris (who is going to be the leader) then so be it.

‘He’ll have to grow some sideburns though.’

The
cycling community has been rocked by Lance Armstrong’s doping scandal 
in recent weeks as he was stripped of all his titles including seven 
consecutive Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005 and banned for life.

The
International Cycling Union recently ratified sanctions recommended by 
the United States Anti-doping Agency, who concluded that Armstrong and 
his U.S. Postal Service team ran ‘the most sophisticated, 
professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever 
seen’. 

But despite 
cycling’s tarnished reputation Wiggins believes he is far from finished 
with the sport and feels that there is less pressure now that 
Armstrong’s wins have been expunged.

Wiggins
said: ‘We don’t have to win seven Tours now, we know that. The pressure
is off with that because as it stands here I’ve won more Tours than 
Lance Armstrong.

'Do it all again': Wiggins, arrived at the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards without his sideburns (left), said he was extremely proud of his wins, including his Olympic medals (right sitting in his throne after winning the men's individual time trial), and has already started training for next year

‘I’ve done this off my own back and it 
will always live with me. I have a tattoo on my forearm that says “The 
Tour” and the date I won it because I’m so proud of it. I will die with 
that.

‘Cycling has been tipped upside down 
over the past couple of weeks but this one hasn’t been built on sand and
I’m extremely proud of that.’

'It’s
all very well Lance standing up and hearing these stories of him 
punching the seats on the bus and saying “we’re going to kick a***” and 
do this and that.

'That’s all very well and good when you’ve got 10 litres of someone else’s blood running through your body.'

Wiggins has set his sights on cycling wins next year.

He said: ‘I’ve already started training for next year because it is about doing it all over again.

‘I’d
love to win the Tour of Italy because for me it is as big as the Tour 
de France. I’ve been very fortunate to lead the Tour of Italy and that 
jersey takes pride of place in my house.’

‘I’m still just still a normal bloke from Kilburn and it has never come easy to me. I train hard and I work hard.’
