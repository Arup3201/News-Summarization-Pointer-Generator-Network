Flight attack: Jeff Ellis, of West Linn, Oregon, was stung by a scorpion while on a commercial flight from Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska

You would expect the worst thing stopping you getting a bit of sleep on a red-eye flight might be a screaming child or an air hostess.

But Jeff Ellis, of West Linn, Oregon, was stung by a scorpion while on a commercial flight from Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska.

He was trying to sleep on the 1,400-mile overnight Alaska Airlines flight when he felt something in his sleeve and tried to brush it away.

He then felt the crawling again, looked 
down and saw the culprit. ‘I picked my hand up and said: “Oh, my God. 
That's a scorpion”,’ he told KPTV.

Mr Ellis said he grabbed the scorpion with a napkin and showed it to his girlfriend, but not before it stung him on the elbow.

‘At first I didn't believe him,’ said his girlfriend Suzanne Foster.

‘But then I saw it. He held the napkin up for me to see, and I saw the tail wiggling. I pretty much jumped out of my seat.’

She called for the flight attendant because Mr Ellis noticed his elbow burning and said it felt like a bee sting.

The flight originated from Austin, Texas, where Alaska Airlines officials believe the scorpion got on board.

An Alaska Airlines spokesman said the airline has never had a poisonous creature on one of its flights before.

Based on photos he took of the arachnid, Mr Ellis believes he was stung by a striped bark scorpion common in Texas.

Oregon reptile expert Marshall Brooks said bark scorpions are more venomous than emperor scorpions, which are commonly kept as pets.

He said most people will experience minor pain from a bark scorpion sting unless they are allergic, in which case it might cause anaphylactic shock.

‘He got stung because he threatened it,’ Mr Brooks said.

‘Had he used something else to get it off with or just calmly tried to move it onto something else, it probably wouldn't have stung him.’

Mr Ellis said he is pleased with how the airline handled the situation and he has been offered 4,000 frequent-flier miles and two round-trip tickets.

‘Never in a million years, would I have thought a scorpion would have been on an Alaska Airlines flight headed to Alaska,’ he said.

‘Everybody I've talked to thinks it was incredible, unbelievable. I'm here to tell you, it was definitely there.’
