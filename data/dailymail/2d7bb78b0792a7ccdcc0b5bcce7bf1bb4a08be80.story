The Denver Broncos soared into the Super Bowl riding the NFL's best offense on the arm of future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and limped away a 43-8 loser.

Manning came into the big game as good as ever after setting regular season records for touchdowns (55) and passing yards (5,477) but failed to live up to mile high expectations in what was expected to be the signature moment of his career,

The Seattle Seahawks league-best defense intercepted the future hall of famer twice en route to blocking his bid to tie brother Eli Manning with two championships.

Manning was the story of the week, all eyes were on him - especially in brother Eli's home stadium - and he came out flat and only got worse as the game went on.

Seattle brought an unrelenting pass rush and 
swarming coverages that kept Manning's internal clock from ever developing a normal rhythm 
despite him completing a Super Bowl-record 33 passes.

'They havenâ€™t played a defense that flies around like we do, that hits like we do, and we just do it every single play,' said linebacker Bobby Wagner. 'We figured that the longer and longer the game went, they were going to fall eventually.'

Manning never had a chance. Seattle coach Pete Carroll's defense knocked the Broncos all over the field and intercepted Manning twice in the first half, with Super Bowl MVP linebacker Malcolm Smith returning a pick 69 yards for a touchdown.

Trouble from the start: A bad snap sent the ball flying over Manning's head during the Broncos' first offensive play of the game

The five-time MVP overthrew receivers 
all night, threw wobbly passes and rarely had time to scan the field as 
Seattle's unrelenting pass rush constantly kept him under pressure.

'Give Seattle a lot of credit, they are an excellent football team and they caused a lot of our mistakes,' Manning said.

His
 troubles started when a loud crowd led to a high snap that sailed over 
his head and resulted in a safety that gave Seattle an early 2-0 lead 
and the ball.

His first 
interception led to Seattle's second field goal, the hole began to grow,
 but no one thought Manning would be unable to bring the Broncos back.

Denver's
 next drive ended when Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor intercepted an 
errant Manning throw that resulted in Seattle's first touchdown a few 
plays later when running back Marshawn Lynch took a one yard hand off in
 for the score only a few minutes into the second quarter.

The score was quickly 15-0, Manning was in a manageable hole until the wheels finally came off.

He
 began the Broncos next possession by completing 7 of 9 passes for 47 
yards and finally started to resemble the quarterback who won his fifth 
MVP award this season.

The 
sixth pass was a death knell, it fluttered through the air and was 
picked off by Super Bowl MVP linebacker Marcus Smith - he returned it 69
 yards for a touchdown.

The wobbling pass resembled the ducks
 that Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman said the 17-year veteran throws
 at this stage of his career.

'We needed to play really well in order to win, and we didnâ€™t come anywhere close to that,' said Manning.

Manning's
 dismal first half was punctuated by another duck thrown on 4th and two 
with 1:01 left, it barely missed being intercepted.

He finished the first half 17 of 23 for 104 
yards and was shown walking off the field with his tail between his legs
 before time even expired in the second quarter - one that is likely to 
haunt him for many years.

The nightmare only continued in the 
second when Denver kick Matthew Prater went for hang time on the opening
 kick as he tried to give his coverage team enough time to get to the 
dangerous Harvin.

Harvin's return put Manning and the Broncos in a 29-0 hole they never recovered from.

The sure-fire hall of famer overthrew several receivers in the second half and looked nothing like the Peyton Manning who led the Broncos to 13 regular season wins in 2013.

Manning was able to put together a Super Bowl-record 34 completions, but the historic mark rang hollow as he failed to earn his second championship.

He completed a record 13 receptions to receiver Demarius Thomas, including his lone touchdown, but it was too little too late.

The former Indianapolis Colt fell to 1-2 
in the big game. The Seahawks defense added insult to injury late in the
 fourth quarter when the ball was knocked out of his hands for a fumble 
in what amounted to garbage time.

Manning finished 34 of 49 for 280 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions - good for a 73.5 rating.

It may have been the last game he plays in the NFL, and it was one of the worst performances he ever turned in.

'To finish this way is very disappointing,' Manning admitted. 'It's a bitter pill to swallow.'

The all-pro quarterback has stated he wants to return next year, but cannot do so until given clearance by doctors that will check his surgically repaired neck in the next few months.

Manning hadn't missed a start in his first 12 season in the league until a severe neck injury cost him the entire 2011 season and saw him released by the Indianapolis Colts - the team that drafted him.

His career was feared over then, he came back a vengeance. He might not come back this time.
