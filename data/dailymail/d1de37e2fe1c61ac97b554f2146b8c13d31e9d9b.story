A previously unknown sketch by John Constable that is said to be an early inspiration for his famous work The Hay Wain today sold for £42,000 - six times its estimated value

The small pencil drawing of a horse and plough was one of seven 'lost' works produced by the 18th century English painter which went under the hammer for a total of £222,000 (with fees added on), far exceeding the original expected sum of around £60,000.

The sketches, and an eighth by Constable's son, Lionel, were bought in a London art store in 1952 by the current owner's father for £500.

The works had been hung in their house in Norfolk ever since without the family realising who they were by.

The 9cm by 11cm work of the horse and plough next to a stream was created by the artist in a pocket-sized pad while on honeymoon in Berkshire in 1816.

Significantly, it was drawn five years before The Hay Wain - his masterpiece of three horses pulling a large cart across a river in Suffolk.

Experts said the drawing may have been a factor when he painted one of the most famous paintings by an English artist.

Another sketch entitled Storm Clouds showing a gloomy Suffolk landscape sold for £44,000 today.

And another small work of river meadows in East Bergholt, Suffolk, achieved a price of £38,000.

The total price for the seven drawings - plus the other by Lionel -  was £187,000, but with all the fees added on, the overall price was £222,000.

The anonymous seller had taken the drawings to Cheffins Auctioneers of Cambridge as he was moving house and wanted to see if they had any worth.

He was said to be 'very pleased' with the outcome of the sale.

Sarah Flynn, paintings expert at Cheffins, said: 'Discovering these drawings in an unknown, private collection was very exciting.

'Most similar Constable drawings are now in museums.

'The
 personal touch that one of the drawings was sketched on Constable's 
honeymoon also contributed to their rarity, which made them even more 
desirable.

'The horse and plough, drawn on his honeymoon, portrays Constable's deep love of the countryside and rural England.

'This perhaps was a factor in his later 
The Hay Wain, which was drawn at a particularly happy moment in his life
 as he had fought to marry Maria.

The honeymoon sketch, called Heavy Horse at Rest Beside a Plough is inscribed 'Binfiled Decr. 6th 1816'.

An eighth drawing included in today's auction was by the hand of Constable's son Lioneland was produced after his father's death in 1837. It sold for £2,000.

All eight sketches were bought by the vendor’s father from the art dealers the Leggatt Brothers.

The brothers handled a large quantity of Constable's sketches in oil, 
watercolour and pencil in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries.

John Constable died on March 31, 1837 at the age of 60 from heart failure

Born in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists.

Largely self-taught, he was influenced by Dutch painters - and is best known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up.

His most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the National Gallery.

Finished in 1821, The Hay Wain was one of six large canvases depicting the area around Flatford Mill in Suffolk.

Another
 in the series, The Lock, became one of the most expensive British 
paintings ever sold when it fetched £22.4million at auction in 2012

Despite his works now attracting huge fees, Constable was not financially successful in life.

He also struggled to gain recognition from his peers and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52.

He died in March 1837, aged 60, of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife.

His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.
