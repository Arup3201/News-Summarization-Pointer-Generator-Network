Harry Kane stepped out for his first senior England training session at St George's Park on Tuesday morning and it would seem Roy Hodgson is planning to throw the Tottenham striker in at the deep end.

According to Hodgson's training notes, Kane was part of a two-man attack alongside Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney in what seemed to be plans for a five-a-side match. 

The 21-year-old's name was written next to Rooney's with two large circles around each and in front of a back three of Kyle Walker, Gary Cahill and Kieran Gibbs.

Kane looked at ease during a light warm-up as he jogged alongside fellow uncapped Spurs team-mate Ryan Mason, who was drafted in to the squad after Adam Lallana withdrew because of a groin injury.

Before training began, Rooney was presented with England Player of the Year award as voted for by fans, while Chelsea youngster Dominic Solanke received the Young Player of the Year gong before joining Hodgson's squad for Tuesday's session.

James Milner, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines trained in the gym as part of their usual regimes while Jordan Henderson and Michael Carrick only took part in the first half of the session.

Speaking of his first England call-up, Kane said recently: 'I can't wait. It has been a dream to be called up but obviously I want to go and play.

'There is great competition for places and hopefully I can just do my best whilst I am away and see what happens.

'I want to play for England like any boy would. That's what I want to do.

'There is great competition and I have to keep working hard if I want to get a place in the team.' 

Kane's chances of making his England debut improved on Monday night after Daniel Sturridge withdrew from the squad to face Lithuania and Italy through injury.

Sturridge had a scan at St George's Park late on Monday evening after reporting for duty with a hip problem he suffered in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.

After assessing the results, the England medical staff decided Sturridge would not be able to play in the upcoming matches and sent the striker back to Liverpool.

Sturridge's withdrawal is unfortunate for the player and Hodgson, who has not been able to select the 25-year-old since September.

As one of just three strikers in the 24-man party, Kane now has a good chance of starting either the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley or the friendly in Turin four days later.
