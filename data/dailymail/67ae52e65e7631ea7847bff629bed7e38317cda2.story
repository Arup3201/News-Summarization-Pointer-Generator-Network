We've all been told eating green vegetables is an important part of our diet and can boost general health and development, but the advice could have even better results than first thought.

Eating one or two cups of steamed broccoli every day could be a new treatment to help asthmatics, according to Melbourne researchers.

'In Australia, asthma affects one in ten people and it's something that is on the rise,' said University of Melbourne honours student Nadia Mazarakis, who undertook research on the topic with supervisor Dr Tom Karagiannis.

Laboratory testing by the university also revealed eating vegetables from the cruciferous family, including kale, cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and bok choy, reduces and even reverses lung damage.

Ms Mazarakis said the research was still in the experimental phase and during an asthma attack or severe breathing issues normal medical advice must be followed.

Kale has recently had a massive resurgence in popularity due to is 'superfood' qualities and high nutritional value.
