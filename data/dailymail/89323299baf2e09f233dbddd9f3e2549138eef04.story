Billionaire oil tycoon William 'Bill' Koch has revealed he splashed out about $5 million on rare French wines which turned out to be fake.

Many of the counterfeits were produced by convicted fraudster Rudy Kurniawan who re-marked bottles of cheap wine with photocopied labels of top vintages.

'I just had to have them,' Koch, 74, told ABC News' 20/20 program. 'Then I’d open it up and 
drink it and it was dish water or moose piss.'

Ripped off: Billionaire William Koch, 74, has admitted he spent $5 million on counterfeit wines

Koch, an avid wine collector, admitted he bought about 500 bottles at up to $100,000 each, thinking they were from the finest French chateaus.

Although he said there would be little sympathy for a wealthy person who'd been conned, Koch choked up while describing the debasement of 'the art, craftsmanship' of fine wines being faked.

Koch, who lives in a waterfront mansion in Florida, is estimated to worth $4 billion from oil and other investments.

'I cannot stand to be cheated,'
Koch told 20/20. 'I want someone to know they sell me a fake, 
man, I’m coming after them no matter how much it costs.'

Koch, whose twin brother is billionaire David Koch, has spent millions on lawyers and private detectives to expose the fakes.

Koch’s team worked with the FBI, and he agreed to testify against Kurniawan at his criminal fraud trial.

Fraud: Investigators found detailed instructions for fabricating labels as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages at Rudy Kurniawan's California home

Rudy Kurniawan took the wine world by storm by claiming he had access to wines many thought had long since disappeared. Many experts gave his vintages glowing reviews.

But the Indonesian-born conman slipped up when he tried to sell fakes purportedly from France’s Domaine Ponsot at a New York auction.

When the FBI raided Kurniawan’s California home in March 2012, they discovered he created his fine vintages in his kitchen, attaching photocopied labels from top producers to bottles of cheap Napa Valley wines.

Kurniawan’s lawyer, Jerome Mooney, said his client is sorry for what he did but that the harm to wealthy collectors such as Koch was minor.

'Nobody was hurt by this, absolutely nobody was hurt by this,' Mooney told 20/20. 'It not that it’s less of a crime but that it’s less of an impact.'

Kurniawan was convicted in December and will be sentenced on July 17.
