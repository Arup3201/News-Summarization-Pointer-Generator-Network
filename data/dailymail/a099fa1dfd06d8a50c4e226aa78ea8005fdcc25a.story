Six major banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays face huge fines for rigging the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market.

Those also involved in the negotiations are understood to include HSBC, US banks Citigroup and JPMorgan and Swiss lender UBS.

The probe centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.
