He's gone from standing in the dock of a central London court to lounging on the deck of a luxury yacht and even with the threat of an FA charge against him - nothing can take the wind out of footballer John Terry's sails.

The 31-year-old Chelsea captain was spotted relaxing on the boat with his wife Toni and her parents in an effort to put his recent troubles behind him.

A thrilled Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence against Anton Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrate's Court last Friday and in true footballer fashion decided to head for the nearest available sunshine to help him wash the criminal charges right out of his hair.

Leaving his troubles behind: John Terry relaxes on a yacht in the south of Portugal following his court case last week

Wearing a pair of pink swimming shorts and a red T-Shirt, Terry looked completely at ease as he kept himself busy on the yacht.

His wife kept him company wearing a white bandeau bikini and sunglasses as they relaxed in the sunshine.

Tonie's mother was also seen sporting a white bikini as the group soaked up the heat and worked on their tans.

They were later spotted enjoying drinks in the shade on the yacht which was named Aaliyah.

It was a million miles away from Terry's gruelling schedule last week which saw him arriving at court by 9.45, standing in a dock and listening to legal counsel for hours.

The multimillionaire defender was prosecuted over an ugly clash that lasted less than 35 seconds during a game last October watched by more than two million fans on television.

He was accused of hurling a volley of racist abuse at Ferdinand, whose brother is Terry’s England team-mate Rio, after being taunted over his affair with a team-mate’s girlfriend.

He admitted calling him a ‘f****** black c***’ and a ‘f****** k***head’ as they squared up on the pitch.

But the 31-year-old claimed he was simply repeating the words after being falsely accused of saying them. As the pair traded insults, he claims to have heard Ferdinand say: ‘Calling me a black c***?’, and to have replied: ‘A black c***? You f****** k***head.’

The players met in the Chelsea changing room after the match and shook hands, writing it all off as ‘handbags’ and on-pitch ‘banter’.

Even when he was shown footage of the incident on YouTube, Ferdinand did nothing.

But an off-duty police officer watching on TV, who claimed to be able to lip read, complained to the Met that a racially-aggravated offence had taken place.

Friends: Ashley Cole (R) backed Terry in court and is now enjoying a holiday in Los Angeles

However, the England captain marched out
of court in silence on Friday after a judge said it was impossible to 
prove he was guilty.

Meanwhile, as Terry enjoyed his summer holiday, his team mate Ashley Cole - who backed him in court - is enjoying another getaway in Los Angeles.

According to The Sun, the Chelsea player is said to have been partying with Drake and spent £13,000 on champagne at a Hollywood club one night.
