One year after Trista Reynolds was told her then-20-month-old daughter Ayla had gone missing, the Maine mother says her pain while still not knowing where her baby is, hasn't grown much dimmer.

'It’s still painful, but I have been able to cope a lot better lately,' she told the Bangor Daily News this week. 'There are days I can’t even hear her voice anymore ... That’s not OK.'

The case of Ayla Reynolds – which drew national attention as hundreds of searchers looked for her last December in the central Maine town of Waterville – remains open despite police earlier this year determining, without a body recovered, that she's dead.

Recovering from heartbreak: Mother Trista Reynolds expresses her lasting heartbreak in losing her then 20-month-old daughter Ayla, one year ago this week

No end: Trista Reynolds, looks through a family photo album at her home in Gorham, Maine, showing her daughter, Ayla Reynolds, 2, who went missing on December 16 of 2011

'Sometimes I feel like they're just kind of giving up on it,' said Ms Reynolds. 'You know, Ayla has been missing for a year, and what answers do they have for anybody? None.'

Today Ms Reynolds' daughter Ayla would be 
the same age as her 20-month-old son, Ayla's younger brother, Raymond.

She credits him for keeping her 
together.

Nationally, about 800,000 children and teens are reported missing each year, said Robert Lowery from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Most are soon resolved in all states, but the number of unresolved cases is uncommonly low in Maine, a mostly rural state with a low crime rate.

Ayla, a toddler with bright blue eyes and a bright smile, was at her father’s home on December 17 when first reported missing.

Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing by her father 
Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed 
the previous night

The disappearance prompted a massive 
search by Waterville and state police, game wardens, and FBI agents who 
canvassed neighborhoods and lowered several streams.

Police
announced that they didn't think Ayla was abducted from her bedroom. 
They also confirmed the presence of her blood in the home and said the 
father, Justin DiPietro, and two other adults in the home that night 
know more than they've told detectives, creating an air of suspicion.

DiPietro declined to comment for this story.

Each
month in Maine, police receive more than 100 calls about missing 
children, most of whom are runaways and return home in a day or two. 
Over the past four decades, that adds up to thousands of runaways, along
with kids who become lost or are abducted.

Only
Ayla's and two other cases involving young children remain unsolved in 
Maine, said Stephen McCausland, state police spokesman.

Three-year-old
Doug Chapman was last seen playing with his toy trucks in a sand pile 
behind his family's home in 1971 in Alfred. When his mother went outside
to check on him, he had vanished. Road workers nearby didn't see 
anything. Two bloodhounds tracked his scent to the road.

Carole
Anne Allen, Doug's mother, sympathizes with Trista Reynolds because 
she's been there. Wardens and police searched the woods but found no 
evidence of Doug, not even his loafers, which he had trouble keeping on 
his feet.

The first year, she said, was the worst.

Someone
stayed near the phone at all times. She didn't know how to act. She 
didn't want to give up. But law enforcement gave her little hope.

'That's
the worst thing. There is no closure. It's like every day you think you
see a person who's about the age he would be now. And you think, `Could
he be my son? Is my son in the woods where he died? Or is he alive 
somewhere?' Forty-one years later, I'm still looking,' she said.

Another
child, 4-year-old Kurt Ronald Newton, of Manchester, disappeared four 
years later from a campground near the Canadian border. That case also 
led to a massive search, but the boy was never found. He father declined
to talk about it for this story.

Part
of Trista Reynolds' healing was to move to a small town outside of 
Portland, where she lives with her toddler son and her boyfriend. She 
said she's no longer confronted with daily reminders of Ayla, as she was
in Portland, where the two had lived. She's also seeing a therapist. 
She's addressed her substance abuse – which led to Ayla being placed 
with DiPietro in Waterville, 75 miles away – and she's in a better place
as she cares for 20-month-old Raymond.

Grim discovery: Ayla's blood was found in DiPietro's home during a police investigation, but no one has been charged in the case

'I'm
trying to keep in the spirit of things,' she says of her home, which is
decorated for the holidays. 'Even if my sprits aren't way up, I've got 
to be up for him,' she said of Raymond, a blond bundle of energy who 
enjoys dancing to Maroon 5's 'Moves like Jagger,' just as his sister 
Ayla did.

While Ayla's disappearance remains a mystery, Reynolds questions whether 'mystery' is the right word.

Reynolds
said police confirmed to her that DiPietro walked out of an interview 
when he was confronted with photos showing Ayla's blood in the basement.
They also confirmed that before dialing 911 the morning that Ayla was 
reported missing, DiPietro called his friend, an insurance agent who 
wrote a life insurance policy on Ayla.

State
police have declined to comment, other than to say they're not giving 
up. Police planned to discuss the case at a news conference Friday.

It's difficult for Reynolds to accept that Ayla may be dead, as police now believe.

In
Alfred, Allen still thinks daily about her son. She wonders if he was 
taken by someone who wanted a child, or became a victim of a crime, or 
simply became lost in the woods.

She said she has a window into how Reynolds must feel.

'Don't
tell me my boy is dead unless you have a body, because I don't want to 
go there,' she said. 'You don't want to give up hope.'

In May, law
enforcement officials said for the first time that they believe 
Ayla is no longer alive.

The toddler had last been seen wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them. She had a cast on her broken left arm.

Before a news conference that would announce police's tragic conclusion for the girl, detectives called Ayla's parents to deliver the somber news that they no longer believe she'll be found alive.

Asked if police believe a crime was committed, Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland said: 'We believe foul play has been involved ... this is a criminal investigation.'

pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom

In Portland, Ayla's mother, along with her own father and mother, burst into tears while watching the news conference.

'Everybody broke down. I'm still crying. I'm still hurting now,' said Ronald Reynolds, Ayla's grandfather, in Portland.

'Why Ayla? She never bothered anybody. She never hurt anybody. Why hurt Ayla?'

'My worst nightmare has come true,' said Trista Reynolds on video captured from her father's home.

Ayla's
father, Justin DiPietro, told police he was thankful for the 
information, Mr McCausland said, adding, 'His reaction was no reaction.'

Mr
DiPietro has said he thinks Ayla was abducted, but police say there's 
no evidence of that. No arrests have been made in the case.

State
police confirmed that Ayla's blood was found in Mr DiPietro's house and
said he, his girlfriend and his sister - who were there the night Ayla 
disappeared - know more than they're telling police.

Denial: Mr DiPietro, 24, says that he is not involved in his daughter Ayla's disappearance, but police believe he's not telling them the full story

Police
repeated that assertion on Thursday when asked about the father. 'We 
believe he knows more than he's told us,' Mr McCausland said.

Neither Mr DiPietro nor a lawyer hired by members of his family returned a call. There was no answer when a reporter knocked on DiPietro's door.

After Ayla was reported missing, dozens of game wardens, FBI agents and local and state police officers participated in the search in this central Maine city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state capital, Augusta.

Police checked trash bins and FBI agents knocked on doors. Officials even went so far as to drain a stream so wardens could get a better look.

Recently, divers searched the Kennebec River and retrieved some items. Investigators declined to comment on those items Thursday.

Investigators said that they have received more than 1,100 tips and that people shouldn't expect it to be solved overnight, Mr McCausland said.

'This isn't 'CSI' where everything is solved in 60 minutes,' he said.
