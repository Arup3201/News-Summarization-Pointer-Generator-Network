America's first Ebola victim Thomas Duncan is believe to have been visiting the U.S. for the first time, his girlfriend's ex-husband has said today. 

The 42-year-old Liberian is visiting Louise Troh and their son in Dallas, Texas, on a tourist visa, and entered the country on September 20.

Mr Duncan began showing symptoms of Ebola 'four or five days' after his arrival, and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday.

Unlucky: America’s first Ebola victim Thomas Duncan, who has been hospitalized in Dallas, Texas, is believe to have been visiting the U.S. for the first time

Details of Mr Duncan's life and relations to the U.S. are few, however he is believed to hail from the Liberian capital Monrovia where he attended high school.

His girlfriend Louise Troh also hails from Liberia, but it is not known how long the couple have been together, although they do have one son.

On a Facebook profile believed to belong to Ms Troh, she has 'checked in' as being in the Liberian capital Monrovia as recent as August 11.

Troh's ex-husband Joe Joe Jallah, who met with Mr Duncan before he was hospitalised, told the Wall Street Journal that believed that this was Mr. Duncan’s first trip to America. 

His partner, Ms Troh, a careworker, is in quarantine at the Dallas apartment she was sharing with Duncan, along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews, aged 23 and 28.

The area of Dallas-Fort Worth in north-Texas has a thriving Liberian community of 5,000-10,000 members, a community now in shock at the news of Duncan's illness.

Mr Duncan arrived from Liberia, an Ebola 'hot zone' in West Africa, on September 20. He began to develop Ebola symptoms - the point when the disease becomes contagious - on September 23. 

He was sent home from his first hospital trip with antibiotics despite telling two medical staff he had flown in from Liberia. His partner Louise said she doesn't believe he left the apartment in this time but she cannot be certain because she was at work. 

His condition deteriorated and he was rushed to hospital via ambulance on Sunday and quarantined.

However it was alleged on Thursday that Mr Duncan lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person, authorities said on Thursday. 

Mr Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas, Texas on September 19. On the form he answered no to every question.

Among other questions, the form asked whether Duncan had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. 

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mr Duncan had helped carried a neighbor's pregnant daughter who was dying from Ebola.

The Liberian government said on Thursday that it planned to prosecute Mr Duncan over the lies while the country's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told CBC today that she was 'very angry' that Mr Duncan had left Liberia after being exposed to Ebola and that his actions were 'unpardonable'. 

President Sirleaf also said that she hoped that no one else would contract the potentially deadly virus which has ravaged her country.

The four schools affected introduced safety measures on Wednesday including cleaning teams and extra nurses to monitor any students suffering from fever or flu-like symptoms

On Thursday afternoon, it was revealed that four sheriff's deputies, a health director and a doctor, went into the quarantined apartment without protection, NBC5 reported. 

Two Douglas County Sheriff's Office patrol cars have now been cordoned off and the deputies have been told to seal their uniforms in bags and go home.  

Meanwhile, the number of family members who came in contact with Mr Duncan while he was contagious remains unclear, CNN reported. 

Louise's daughter, Youngor Yallah, who does not live at the quarantined apartment, was the person who called an ambulance for Mr Duncan on Sunday after she came to her mother's home to bring him tea and found him feverish and shivering.

It is unclear if she traveled with him in the ambulance or came in close contact with the infected man.  

The family who are isolated in the apartment have been told they face criminal charges if they leave the apartment or accept visitors.

Dallas Judge Clay Jenkins told ABC today that a legal quarantine order was placed on the home after the family tried to break out of the apartment. 

However MailOnline reported on Wednesday that three individuals - a man in his twenties with a roll of garbage bags and two women - came and left the apartment. 

Ms Troh said that she has been given no instructions by the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to dispose of the contaminated bedding in the home or what the family would do for food.

She said that two CDC workers who visited the home on Wednesday brought sandwiches but they had no other food.  

At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Judge Jenkins was quick to respond to those claims, saying that several days supply of food was being delivered to the quarantined group and contaminated material would be removed by biohazard experts.

He added that the family were being treated with the 'utmost respect and dignity'. 

Texas health officials said around 100 people may have come into contact with Mr Duncan and they are being questioned.

Authorities have confirmed 12 people including five children had direct contact with Mr Duncan and are being closely monitored.

Some parents have pulled their children out of four affected Dallas schools after learning that five students may have come into contact with Mr Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.

School administrators appealed for calm as none of the children have shown symptoms and are being told to stay at home, where they will likely remain for three weeks.
