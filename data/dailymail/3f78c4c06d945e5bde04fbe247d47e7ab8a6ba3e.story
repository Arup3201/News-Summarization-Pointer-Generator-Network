Next month marks the 25h anniversary the United Airlines Flight 232 crash in Iowa, which has become the subject of a new book that exposes in graphic detail what went on inside the doomed plane on its long, tortuous way down.

On July 19, 1989, a DC-10 plane with 296 people on board, among them 50 children, was making its way from Denver to Chicago when disaster struck.

As Laurence Gonzalez describes in his book Flight 232: A Story of Disaster and Survival, out in bookstores July 7, about a half hour into the flight travelers and crew heard a deafening explosion.

A short time later, the jumbo job would lose one of its three engines along with its hydraulics systems damaged by flying debris, plummeting to earth northeast of Sioux City, Iowa, where it would burst into a massive fireball.

Against all odds, 185 people made out of the flaming wreckage alive in large part thanks to the actions of the plane's experienced crew.  

In his quest to reconstruct the disaster, Gonzales, himself a commercial pilot, interviewed hundreds of survivors, airport personnel and rescuers in order to piece together the disturbing narrative of the ill-fated flight, the New York Post reported

As Gonzales explains in his book, when it became apparent that the jet was flying on two engines and with no hydraulics to steer it, no one aboard Flight 232 or in the air traffic control tower could imagine that the inevitable crash would be survivable.

One of the passenger interviewed for the book told Gonzales: 'The first thing that strikes your mind is, “Dear God, I’m going to die this afternoon.” The only question that remains is: How long is it going to take Iowa to hit me?’

Flight 232 set out from Stapleton International Airport in Denver at 2.09pm. About 30 minutes later, an explosion rocked the plane when engine No. 2 failed, taking out the hydraulics with it.

Twisted wreckage: On July 19, 1989, the Douglas DC-10-10 plane suffered a full hydraulic failure requiring an attempted landing under throttle control alone. It crashed on the runway at Sioux City, Iowa killing 111 of 296 people on board

Flight attendant Jan Murray recalled that the sound was indescribable. Following her training, the stewardess and her colleagues headed to the cockpit, and what they saw inside made it clear to them that the plane was going down.

After the initial shock, Murray returned to her duties, but was visibly upset. Passenger Dennis Fitch, who happened to be a DC-10 pilot instructor by trade, grabbed her by the hand and reassured her that the jet can fly on two engines.

When Murray said she had been told by the captain that the plane no longer had hydraulics and that the backup system was down, Fitch was incredulous.

Fitch suggested that he might be able to help, and the pilots quickly took him up on his offer, inviting him into the cockpit. Later, the instructor would be hailed as a hero for his role in saving nearly 200 lives.

That day, the person responsible for the fate of all the passengers and crew was Captain Alfred Haynes, a 33-year-old veteran with an extensive experience flying DC-10s.

Haynes decided to put Fitch's expertise to good use and placed him in charge of the throttles.

Back in the cabin, flight attendants were doing all they could to keep panic at bay and guide the passengers through the 'roughest landing' of their lives, as Captain Haynes would later put it when addressing the 295 people before impact.

Jan Brown, the most experienced of the stewardesses, was struck by the realization that there were 50 children aboard the plane who were sitting in their parents' laps rather than in their own seats. 

According to standard operating procedures, Brown was supposed to instruct passengers to place their kids on the floor of the plummeting aircraft and create buffers around them with seat cushions, but she was disgusted at having to utter those words out loud.

‘As I’m saying this, I’m like, “Oh my God, this has got to be the most ludicrous, ludicrous thing I’ve ever said in my life,”’ she told Gonzales.

As the 369,000-pound plane continued cartwheeling over the bluffs outside Sioux City at 250 mph, people began making final preparations: writing notes for loved ones, saying their goodbyes and hiding their driver’s licenses in their clothing to make it easier to identify their remains later.

In the cockpit, the pilots were desperately trying to steer the out-of-control jet toward Runway No 22 at the nearby airport.

The pilots could not afford to let themselves succumb to despair, so they did their best to lighten the mood in the face of an almost certain death.

At one point, the cockpit’s voice record picked up Dennis Fitch tell the captain: ‘I'll tell you what, we'll have a beer when this is all done.’

Al Haynes said in reply: ‘Well I don't drink, but I'll sure as hell have one.’

The 57-year-old captain would later note: ‘We were too busy [to be scared]. You must maintain your composure in the airplane or you will die. You learn that from your first day flying.’

Just after 3.50pm, about an hour after the first fateful explosion, the hulking machine fell out of the sky, screaming toward earth at 240 knots - about 100 knots over normal landing speed.

The plane's right wing was knocked off on impact, causing 10,000lbs of fuel to spew out of the metal stump. The cockpit and the tail came off the wreckage next.

The plane finally came to rest on its back, leaving terrified passengers dangling upside down still bucked in their seats.

'We just smashed into the earth,' recalled Brown, who had half of her hair singed off by the flames raging around the plane.

Sitting in the cockpit with the crew, Dennis Fitch had a firs-row seat on the unfolding calamity.

‘I was upside down, I had mud in my eyes and my ears, I couldn’t hear, I couldn’t see, I couldn’t move... Tremendous pain,’ he was quoted in the book. ‘My ribs were broken and they punctured my right lung cavity and stuck in there. Just couldn’t get a breath of air.’

The air was filled with the anguished screams of the injured and the dying.

When first responders, who have been waiting on the ground as the plane was making its agonizing descent, rushed to the wreckage, they discovered many people with injuries of the sort they have never seen before.

Some people had their clothes dissolve into their skin, others looked like their bodied passed through a cheese grater.

Passenger Brad Griffin was hurled into the air and landed in a cornfield with third-degree burns and broken feet, but such was his shock that he stood up and walked away. 

Many were less fortunate. Gonzales tells in the book about a female passenger who was hanging upside down in her seat and screaming for help.

When first responders finally reached her and slashed the seat belt holding her in place, her body split into two. And then there was the woman who was scalped by debris from her eyes back.

But amid the blood, mud, soot and raging flames there were also numerous acts of heroism.

Firefighters and members of the Iowa National Guard converged on the plane, carrying people, alive, dead and somewhere in between, out to safety.

Larry Niehus, a local firefighter, told Gonzales about the little girl whom he pulled out of the scorched plane, but it was too late for her.

On of the most enduring images to have come out of the crash was that of Guardsman Dennis Nielsen cradling 3-year-old Spencer Bailey after rescuing him out of the plane.

The iconic photo was later turned into a sculpture titled Spirit of Siouxland, which graces the Flight 232 Memorial in Sioux City.

And it was not just professional rescuers who risked their lives to save virtual strangers.

Passenger Jerry Schemmel, then 29 years old, jumped back into the still-burning plane after promising a mother to find her baby - and through luck and sheer determination he was able to make good on his promise.    

‘I know I couldn’t see anything, and I do remember honing in on the cries,’ he is quoted in the book as saying. ‘“Keep crying,” I remember saying to myself. ”Please, keep crying.”’

A National Transportation Safety Board investigation later determined that the crash was caused by a small fatigue crack, which United Airlines maintenance personnel had failed to detect.

On July 18, retired Captain Haynes, Jan Brown and other surviving members of the Flight 232 crew will return to Sioux City for a panel discussion about the disaster that changed their lives forever, according to 9News.

On the day of the 25th anniversary, ceremonies will be held to honor the victims of the crash, followed by a remembrance service.

Several dozen survivors are expected to attend the events surrounding the sombre anniversary.
