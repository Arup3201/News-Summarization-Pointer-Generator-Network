Parts of England could see up to eight inches of snow by tonight as temperatures plunge to an unseasonably bitter -15C (5F).

As another cold front sweeps across Britain, forecasters warn not to expect warmer weather until at least Easter, almost two weeks away.

The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning and is predicting possible disruptions for the North East and Scotland today as they are swept by Arctic winds and blanketed in snow.

Tailback: The A66 was closed by police across the Pennines after the cold snap

Blizzard: A snow plough clears the A66 near Bowes where the road was closed for several hours due to heavy snow

Picturesque: Walkers take to the snow covered fells in the Lake District as wintry weather returned and is expected to last into next week

Fog: Wintry scenes in Bradford west Yorkshire as the snow make a return

According to figures released by the national forecaster, some parts of Britain are 20C colder than this time last year.

Charlie Powell, from the Met  Office, said: ‘It certainly feels cold, particularly when compared to last March when we had some warm, sunny days.

‘Temperatures are quite a bit lower in the North for the season, but not far off in the South. We could see as much as 20cm (7.8in) of snow in the North East of England, with snow also falling across parts of the West Country and Midlands as far south as Oxford.

‘Although it is not unusual to see snow in March and even April, the cold weather does seem to have hung on for quite a long time.

‘Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a big improvement on the horizon, with the unsettled weather set to continue into April.’

Forecasters warned it could feel as cold as -15C tonight due to wind chill in exposed areas, while widespread frosts will see much of the country waking to an icy start over the next two days.

Tony Conlan, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: ‘Most accumulations of snow are likely to be overnight on Tuesday.

‘Temperatures could potentially drop as low as minus 10C or even minus 15C, depending on how much snow we see and how the wind falls.

‘It is nowhere near the UK’s record 
low of minus 27.2C (minus 17F) but it will still be very chilly.’ The 
record low was recorded at Braemar in eastern Scotland on January 10, 
1982, and at Altnaharra in northern Scotland on December 30, 1995.

Today, the cold weather caused problems for rush-hour travellers as a number of trains were delayed or disrupted.

Services
in Hampshire, Surrey and Kent were badly affected, with commuters hit 
by cancellations or postponements due to a build-up of ice on the rails 
affecting power, while passengers were left waiting for trains between 
Rugby, Northampton and London.

Stuck in the Snow Lane: Hundreds of motorists were left gridlocked on one of the North's main cross country routes, the A66, after four inches of snow hit County Durham

Road block: The A66 Transpennine route - which crosses the Cumbria to County Durham border - ground to a halt from around 4.30am yesterday when heavy snow began falling

Traffic jam: Around five to six inches of snow covered the ground - forcing police to close the road in both directions between Stainmore and Barnard Castle

Commenting on the disruptions in 
southern England, transport minister Norman Baker said: ‘It is 
disappointing that performance has been so bad in some parts of the rail
network south of the Thames.

‘I am also disappointed about the lack
of information being given to passengers at some stations. This cold 
snap was forecast well in advance and industry had the equipment and 
time to prepare for this.

‘Passengers should not have to put up with this kind of disruption as they make their way to work on a Monday morning.

Breathtaking: Following an overnight ground frost, steam rises and rolls across a field in huge swathes as the spring sunshine proves it has enough power to quickly heat up the soil near Calwich in Staffordshire

‘The industry seems to have been 
caught wrong-footed again, and needs to take a close look at its 
response plans to avoid a repeat of the problems we have seen.’

The cold weather also brought misery for motorists.

They
faced 15mile tailbacks yesterday as police closed the A66 across the 
Pennines between Bowes, County Durham, and Stainmore, Cumbria, because 
of heavy snow, while Leeds Bradford International Airport was also 
closed in the morning.
