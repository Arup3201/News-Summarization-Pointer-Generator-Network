A Briton has been arrested in Bolivia with a stash of firearms and a hit list of people he intended to murder, police said today.

Armed officers stormed the suspect's hotel room and found a sub-machine gun, a revolver, ammunition and a small quantity of cocaine.

Agapito Torres, regional commander of the National Police's specialist crime-fighting unit, said his officers found 'firearms, ammunition and a list with the names of various people he allegedly planned to assassinate,' local media reported.

The man, who has not been named, had been staying at a hotel in the jungle town of Rurrenabaque, 250 miles north of the capital La Paz.

The town, on the River Beni, is popular with backpackers who use it as a base to explore the spectacular rainforest of the Medidi National Park.

Police raided the hotel on Monday after a neighbour in the town reported that the Briton had threatened to kill him.

The suspect had been staying at the hotel since September 16.

Prosecutor Dennis Benavidez said: 'In his hotel room we found high calibre weapons, a 9mm sub-machine gun, a .38 revolver, bullets, and we also found drugs.'

One local report said the man had claimed to be a from the UK military's special forces.

He did not offer any resistance when arrested.

The suspect arrived in Bolivia on a 90-day tourist visa last month.
