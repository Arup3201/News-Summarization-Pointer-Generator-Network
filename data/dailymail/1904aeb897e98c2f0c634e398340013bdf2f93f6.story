Tiger, Ferret and Awesome are among the quirky names which have been given to babies born in Britain in the last year.

At least three families have given the name Miracle to newborn boys, and at least three girls have been called Tequila by their parents.

A football-mad family even decided to name their child Rooney-Scholes in tribute to two Manchester United footballers.

Quirky: Parents in Britain are giving their children unusual names, following the example set by model Peaches Geldof, who called her son Astala

The records show that, while quirky baby names have commonly be given by celebrities in the past, families across England and Wales are following suit.

While traditional names Harry and Amelia are Britain's most popular, hundreds of more unusual registrations have been recorded.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics reveal that the names Awesome, Marvellous and Excellent were each given to at least three boys in 2011.

Boys called Zeus and Billybob appear to have been named after a Greek god and Hollywood actor Billy Bob Thornton respectively.

And rock stars also seem to have been a source of inspiration, with boys being named Iggy and Ozzie in a nod to musicians Iggy Pop and Ozzy Osbourne.

One family even named their child Jagger-Rock after the lead singer of the Rolling Stones.

As well as Tequila, girls' names include Velvet, Ray, Loveday and Comfort.

Parents keen to instil good manners in their daughters from an early age have called them Purity, Promise and Justice.

Other names registered this year are understood to include Peace, Rogue, River, Serendipity, Diesel-Joe and Rider Zoom.

Many celebrities have given their children unusual names, including Coldplay singer Chris Martin and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who named their daughter Apple.

Models Katie Price and Peaches Geldof named their children Princess Tiaamii and Astala respectively.

Rock musician Frank Zappa arguably came up with even more outlandish names for his children - Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva Muffin.

But few families could match the parents in New Zealand who were ordered by a judge to change their daughter's name in 2008.

They had named her Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii. She was nine years old when the court made its order.
