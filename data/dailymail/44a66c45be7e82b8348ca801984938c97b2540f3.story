The nation might have well been spoiled for choice over the past month when it comes to sporting competitions - but it's unlikely any will have been played out in as much style as this one.

The Chap Olympiad, an eccentric athletic competition held this weekend in London, sees the nation's most refined sportsmen and women take part in an array of police sporting events, while decked out in their best vintage costumes.

Held every year since 2005 in Bloomsbury's Bedford Square, the light-hearted social sporting event
is aimed at revisiting the fashions and pastimes of aspects of 
1920s to 1950s England.

Competitors - who are 'awarded more points for maintaining immaculate trouser creases than crossing the finish line' - take part in events such as umbrella jousting, the 'Tug-'o-Hair' event, the pipeathlon and iron board surfing, while donning stylish bowler hats, monocles and strings of pearls.

The pipeathlon event involved running several 
laps around the venue carrying a fully-lit pipe, while umbrella 
jousting saw competitors fighting off each other while seated in Boris Bikes.

The event is the creation of The Chap magazine, a bi-monthly publication edited by Gustav Temple, which glorifies a dandyish 
way of life involving tweed, pipe smoking and fine facial hair.

Gentlemen were seen kitted out in their finest pinstripe suits and boating hats, while women donned head feathers, A-line dresses and their brightest red lipstick to enjoy the occasion.

The gathering is the place for the most eccentrically and stylishly dressed sportsmen and sportswomen of the nation, as well as well-dressed spectators

The event, billed as 'a celebration of athletic ineptitude and immaculate trouser creases', is the creation of The Chap magazine, a bi-monthly publication edited by Gustav Temple

The event, which includes a 'Tug-'o-Hair' competition, is a chance for Britain's most refined gentlemen to demonstrate their panache by competing in sporting events

Guests not only wear their best vintage outfits but also take along traditional British picnics - which includes grapes, Pimms and strawberries - to eat on the lawn

The event, which attracts thousands, saw a huge crowd this year as it celebrated its tenth anniversary

Even vintage prams - and adorable pets - make an appearance at the Chap Olympiad

Although it is known for its series of wacky events, some guests go to the Chap Olympiad simply to enjoy spending time with friends
