Forget going away for a romantic getaway with your partner, it seems Britons are more likely to watch TV or read than frolic between the sheets in hotels.

Despite results from a global study showing that hotel guests like to sleep naked  on holiday - it seems romantic liaisons are not top of the agenda in hotels.

Of the 39 per cent of people who say they are happy to sleep in the nude on holiday, the nationality most likely to wear their birthday suits in bed is the the French - followed by Britons and Norwegians.

Brits on holiday prefer to watch TV or read than have sex whilst in a hotel on holiday, according to a survey by Hotels.com

1. Watching TV 67%

2. Reading 47%

3. Sex 46%

4. Surfing the internet 40%

5. Eating from the room service menu 20%

The recent survey asked over 250,000 guests about their holiday habits to surprising results. 

For Britain, catching up with TV or a movie was the best loved bedroom activity with 67 per cent of people grabbing for the remote when they hit the sheets. 

Even reading was preferred to romance, with 47 per cent of people enjoying books, and only 46 per cent opting to have sex when they are away.

Even if it is not our top pastime time, it does still beat  surfing the internet (40 per cent) and only a fifth of us would rather order a snack from room service. 

Carolina Annand, of Hotels.com, said: 'It seems on a global scale a lot of us are more than happy to strip for the sheets, yet it is interesting to see in the UK that we prefer to watch TV on a hotel bed rather than any other activity.

'With such a variety of hotel rooms to discover across the globe, both international and domestic, we encourage travellers to really make themselves at home whenever they travel!' 

A third of us enjoy sleeping in the nude, which is said to have many health benefits including lowering blood pressure 

France 51%

UK 24%

Norway 24%

Sweden 20%

Australia 19%

Finland 19%

Denmark 18%

Canada 17%

Netherlands 16%

Ireland 16%

Russia 16%

Brits may love watching TV over making love, but we came in joint second place for the countries who sleep in the nude, with 24 per cent admitting they ditch their pajamas.  

Norwegian and Swedish travelers similarly enjoyed to bare all with a fifth or more people admitting to sleeping in just a sheet.

The benefits of sleeping naked have been promoted by many medical professionals.

'The advantage of sleeping naked is it's easier for the body to cool and maintain the lower temperature the brain wants to achieve,' says Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre and author of Sound Asleep: The Expert Guide To Sleeping Well.

'If anything prevents that decline in temperature, the brain will wake itself up to see what's going on, meaning you'll struggle to get to sleep or you'll have disturbed sleep,' he said.  

Marilyn Monroe was famously not a fan of wearing pajamas and said she only wore Chanel No 5 between 

The survey also revealed the calming impact holidays have on our dreams. 

42% of Brits said dream differently while on holiday with over a quarter (26%) saying their dreams are more relaxing, while 50% of those in Mexico also had calmer dreams, topping the global list. 

This was closely followed by Colombia (48%) and Taiwan (45%) in 2nd and 3rd place respectively.
