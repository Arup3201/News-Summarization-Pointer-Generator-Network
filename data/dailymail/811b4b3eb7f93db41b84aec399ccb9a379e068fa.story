Worrying evidence has emerged that the popular peanut butter sandwich can contain a common flame retardant. 

The chemical found is called HBCD - fire retardants are commonly used in the foam insulation of building walls.

A study on 36 products purchased from grocery stores in Dallas, Texas, found that nearly half of the peanut butter as well as turkey, fish, beef and other fatty foods, contained the traces.

The results were high on fatty foods because HBCDs are fat-soluble.

The findings are concerning because it can take years for flame retardants to break down in the body.

HBCDs make their way into the food chain via the air, water and soil, according to experts.

In the case of peanut butter this may be due to the water that the peanut crops can be watered with.

'This is not good news. Here's yet another toxic chemical that can be found in many of the foods we buy at our supermarkets,' said Dr. Arnold Schecter of the University of Texas School of Public Health and an author of the study published on Thursday.

Worrying: The chemical has even been discovered in umbilical cord blood

'Food does not need to have flame retardants,' Dr Scheter said according to the Huffington Post.

Chemicals that manufacturers use to try to reduce the flammability can be found of products such as  furniture, electronics, baby car seats and carpets.

Two classes of flame 
retardants called brominated and chlorinated have sparked the most worry,
,Dr Schecter to Discovery News.

This is because they build up in human tissues and also because they last for a long time.

One exposed the 
human body can take up to 219 days to break it down.

Even more concerning was a discovery made by the Environmental Working Group.

Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst said that the chemical has even been discovered in umbilical cord blood.

'Exposure starts before birth and may continue on in the diet for their entire life,' she told the website.

Although individually the levels found in the study were not too concerning, the discovery of HBCD adds to growing evidence that food can be full of unwanted chemicals.

Earlier this year, McDonald's altered the ingredients after the Jamie Oliver forced them to remove a processed food type that he labelled 'pink slime'.

The food activist was shocked when he learned that ammonium hydroxide was being used by McDonald's to convert fatty beef offcuts into a beef filler for its burgers in the USA.

'Basically, we’re taking a product that would be sold at the cheapest form for dogs and after this process we can give it to humans' said the TV chef.

It can be difficult to avoid flame retardants, but to reduce chemical exposures, frequent hand-washing is recommended. 

To reduce the amount consumed in food, experts suggest avoiding fatty foods.
