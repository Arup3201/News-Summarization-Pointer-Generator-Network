Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel today gave a pep talk to U.S. troops in Afghanistan during his fourth and final visit to the war-torn country as the Army handed over a top Taliban commander to Pakistan.

Speaking to hundreds of soldiers, the 68-year-old said America aimed to 'work our way, essentially, out of a job as we transition from the combat role we've had over the last 13 years' in Afghanistan.

Instead, the country's military will focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops in the war, which does not appear to be ending any time soon, he said.

Hagel's holiday-season speech at tactical base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan came as the Army handed over three Pakistani detainees to Islamabad, including a senior Taliban commander.

U.S. forces in Afghanistan made the transfer of Latif Mehsud - a close confidante of the ex-head of the Pakistani Taliban and long-wanted by the Pakistani government - on Saturday afternoon.

The move underlines the improving relations between America, Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the latter having previously demanded that Afghan officials hand over militants operating in its territory.

During his visit on Sunday, Hagel said the Afghan army and police forces have made a lot of progress in the war since 2001 - but at the cost of much U.S. blood and treasure.

'We don't want to see that roll back downhill,' said the politician, who is making way for his likely replacement, Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter.

He went on to explain how the soldiers on the remote base in Laghman province in Afghanistan's wild east are the vanguard of the transformed U.S. mission to focus on training Afghan forces.

This noncombat mission aims to ensure that the reason for invading Afghanistan in the first place - al-Qaida's haven for plotting the September 11 attacks - never recurs.

It also aims to avoid the kind of unraveling of security that happened this year in Iraq; large swathes of which have been taken over by militants fighting for the Islamic State (ISIS). 

The Gamberi base - which includes soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment - has been deemed exemplary of America's new mission by President Barack Obama.

It will be one of four 'Train, Advise, Assist Commands' across the country, while several training establishments in  Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, will also be used by U.S. forces.

But despite the noncombat focus of the mission, U.S. special operations forces will continue, mostly in conjunction with Afghan forces, to hunt down al-Qaida remnants or other terrorists.

They will also take on the Taliban if they are deemed to pose a threat to American troop security.

Speaking to the U.S. troops, Hagel warned the soldiers there is no room for complacency and no reason to think that their training and advising work will not present its own risks.

'The job's not done,' he said. 'This is still a dangerous country in many ways.'

The soldiers' mission with NATO allies  will assume a new name on January 1: 'Resolute Support.'

Meanwhile, the combat mission, Operation Enduring Freedom, will finish at the end of December.

This new phase will not last long, however, if current plans hold. Virtually all U.S. troops will be gone two years from now as President Barack Obama completes his final term in office.

The hope is that the Afghans can hold off Taliban militants who, it is feared, could allow a return of al-Qaida or other extremist groups if they were to regain power in Kabul.

On Saturday, General John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that he has Obama's permission to keep up to 10,800 American. troops in the country at the start of 2015.

That is around 1,000 more than previously planned. As a result, there will be little, if any, net drop in U.S. troop numbers between now and December 31.

By the end of 2015, however, the U.S. troop total is to shrink to 5,500, and to near zero by the end of 2016, according to the plans.

In an interview, Campbell said the Afghans are not only capable of providing their own security but are eager to do so.

'They totally have the security. They want to own it. They are proud that they have that back' as a sovereign nation, he said.

He added that part of his challenge is to build confidence among Afghan troops, partly by reminding them that their firepower is superior to that of the Taliban.

'They have this checkpoint mentality' that makes them prefer to wait at fixed positions for the Taliban to come to them, he said. 'I'm trying to get them off that [approach].'

In relation to Mehsu's and the other two detainees' transfers on Saturday, the U.S. did not name the prisoners involved, but two Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed Mehsud was among them.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. said in a statement  that the transfer happened Saturday.

'Yesterday, acting on behalf of the United States Government, we transferred custody of three Pakistanis held in U.S. custody in Afghanistan to Pakistan,' it said.

'This followed consultations between the United States and Pakistan and after receiving appropriate assurances. We cannot comment on the identities of the detainees.'

The military said the Afghan government was not involved in the transfer. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry referred all questions to the Interior Ministry, which could not be reached for comment.

A spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Mehsud was not in Afghan custody at the time and that they were gathering information about his release. 

Mehsud was captured in October of last year by American forces.

He was a driver for the former Pakistani Taliban head, Hakimullah Mehsud, and eventually became a trusted deputy to the militant commander, who was killed in November of last year in an American drone strike. 

Newly-elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani visited Pakistan in November. The visit was seen as an attempt to repair ties with Pakistan, which has long had a rocky relationship with Afghanistan. 

Former Afghan president Karzai repeatedly accused the Pakistani government of harboring militants who launched cross-border attacks.

Part of the reason for the improved ties has been a military operation launched in June by the Pakistani military in the North Waziristan tribal area, something long demanded by the United States. North Waziristan is home to both local and al-Qaida-linked militants.
