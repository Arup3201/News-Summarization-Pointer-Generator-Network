For five years, Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has circled the moon, sending back thousands of images of the lunar surface.

Nasa has now revealed the most stunning five images of the lunar surface - and has asked the public to pick their favourite.

The space agency is planning to create a special site called 'The Moon as Art' - with the winning image as the cover photo.

Linné (2.2 km diameter) is a very young and beautifully preserved impact crater on the lunar surface.. LROC stereo images provide scientists with the third dimension - information critical for unraveling the physics involved in impact events.

LRO entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution.

The robotic mission set out to map the moon's surface and, after a year of exploration, was extended with a unique set of science objectives.

LRO observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries, creating a new picture of the moon as a dynamic and complex body.

These developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system.

''The Moon as Art' collection gives the public the opportunity to see the moon as others have seen it for centuries – as an inspirational muse – but this time from the perspective of being in orbit with a series of 'eyes' that see in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,' said Brooke Hsu, science education specialist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute/Universities Space Research Association in Greenbelt, Maryland.

LRO launched from Florida on June 18, 2009.

After a four-day journey, the orbiter successfully entered lunar orbit June 23.

The winning cover image will be announced June 18 with the release of the full Moon as Art collection of 24 images.

Voting is already underway here and will close June 6.

In the five years since, LRO has brought the world astounding views of the lunar surface and a plethora of exciting science data.

'LRO has been a remarkable mission with discoveries that have given us insight into solar system history and the inner workings of the moon,' said John Keller, LRO project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

'After five years, LRO continues to make ground breaking discoveries.'

The craft will celebrate five years in orbit June 18.

LRO entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution.

On 10 June 2011 the LRO spacecraft slewed 65° to the west, allowing the LROC NACs to capture this dramatic sunrise view of Tycho crater.  Tycho's features are so steep and sharp because the crater is young by lunar standards, only about 110 million years old.

The interior wall of the Clerke crater has many distinct flows of granular material which narrow as they reach towards the floor of the crater. The crater is 7 km in diameter located at 21.7°N, 29.8°E near the Taurus Littrow Valley where Apollo 17 landed on 11 December 1972 and is named after Agnes Mary Clerke.

This image features night time temperatures at the Moon's north pole as measured by the Diviner instrument. Areas in blue and purple represent colder temperatures, while areas in orange and red represent warmer temperatures. At any given point in the Moon's orbit, half of the Moon is in daylight, while half of the Moon is in darkness.

The Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) sends laser pulses down to the surface of the Moon from the orbiting spacecraft. These pulses bounce off of the Moon and return to LRO, providing scientists with measurements of the distance from the spacecraft to the lunar surface. As LRO orbits the Moon, LOLA measures the shape of the lunar surface, which includes information about the Moon's surface elevations and slopes.
