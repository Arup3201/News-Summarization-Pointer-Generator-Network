The starting pistol has been fired on the campaign to pack bars and clubs in Magaluf with thrill-seeking British teenagers this summer.

After new lows were plumbed by venues in the Majorcan resort last year, clubs are gearing up for another summer of binge drinking, sun, sea and sex.

Clubs linked to the one where a girl performed sex acts on 24 men last July are advertising positions for 'podium dancers' over the coming summer.

Meanwhile Carnage Magaluf, the company who organised the now infamous event, is already signing youngsters up for 'unlimited free shots' on £30 'booze cruises'.

Bars and clubs in Magaluf are playing on the resort's reputation in ad campaigns targeting British teens

Nightclub promoters in Magaluf have begun tweeting messages to bring in youngsters this summer

The Carnage Magalluf firm is even trading off the back of events last summer, tweeting: 'Who's ready for the world famous bar crawl starting in April?'

The firm's website is now advertising VIP pool parties, jungle sessions and bar crawls alongside images of a barman pouring spirits into a young woman's mouth in a so-called 'dentist's chair' position.

It comes as police on the Spanish island are given new powers to seize drinks from tourists on the street between 10pm and 8am.

There will also be tougher restrictions bar crawls and fines for 'balconing' - a craze for jumping off hotel balconies which has led to several deaths.

Authorities are also in talks to fly in British police to patrol the streets over the height of the summer season.

But those organising the bar crawls have shrugged off the new controls, which they fear could deter youngsters wanting to let loose.

Organisers of the Carnage Magaluf bar-crawl, at which a British teenager was encourage to perform sex acts on 24 men last year, have played on their notoriety while others insist new rules will not affect street drinking 

Adverts are being sent out adversing cocktails for just one euro (80 pence) in many bars in the resort

The Magaluf 2015 Twitter feed posted a message saying: 'Absolute nonsense about drinking laws in #Magaluf. Clubs still open till 6am, bars open until 4am, some bars open at 6am!'

It also posted a photo of bikini-clad girls covered in red liquid with the caption: 'I can't wait to be ashamed of all the things I do in Magaluf 2015', adding 'Don't believe the hype, the Magaluf street drinking ban isn't going to change anything this summer!'.

Bars are already advertising their one euro drinks deals - with cocktails called 'f***** hammered', 'scruffy cow' and 'f***** up', described as a 'nine spirit mix', all available for less than a pound.

The resort was shamed last summer when a video emerged of an 18-year-old girl from Northern Ireland performing sex acts on 24 men, who lined up in the resort's Alex's Bar.

Witnesses said the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party organisers she would win a 'holiday'.

But her prize reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice.
