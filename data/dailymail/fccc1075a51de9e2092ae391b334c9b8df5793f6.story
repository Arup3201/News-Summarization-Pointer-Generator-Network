A renowned Republican strategist and lobbyist has claimed that former president Lyndon B. Johnson set up John F. Kennedy’s assassination, which occurred on November 22, 1963.

Roger Stone, 61, makes the claim in his upcoming book 'The Man who killed Kennedy - the case against LBJ,' which is set to be published in October.

He also writes that Richard Nixon and 
Johnson had a documented relationship with Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey 
Oswald’s killer, years before he shot Oswald in the basement of Dallas 
police headquarters in 1963, reports The Daily Caller.

Bold claim: Esteemed Republican strategist and lobbyist Roger Stone writes in his forthcoming book that former president Lyndon B. Johnson set up John F. Kennedy's assassination

Stone worked for Richard Nixon’s 
Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972 and later served in the 
Nixon administration.

He claims that Johnson, a congressman at the time, 
instructed Richard Nixon, also a congressman at the time, to hire Ruby 
onto the House of Representatives payroll in 1947.

Stone claims Johnson ‘micro-managed’ Kennedy’s Dallas motorcade, demanding it pass through Dealy Plaza on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, the infamous day when Oswald shot Kennedy from the overlooking book depository building.

‘Nixon knew Jack Ruby, hired him on House payroll in 1947 at request of … Lyndon Johnson. Newly released documents prove it. in my upcoming book “The Man who killed Kennedy- the case against LBJ” Out Oct 1–order yours today,’ Stone wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday.

Stone writes that Lyndon B. Johnson instructed Richard Nixon to hire Ruby onto the House of Representatives payroll in 1947

‘LBJ and Gov. John Connally 
micro-managed Dalla JFK’s schedule and demanded the route thru Dealy 
Plaza where the motorcade came to a full stop and LBJ had JFK killed,’ 
he added.

‘They had no interest in JFK stops in Austin or Houston!'

Stone, now a member of the Libertarian Party, co-wrote his book with Libertarian writer Mike Colapietro.

Ruby, whose real name was Jacob Leon Rubenstein, moved from Chicago to Dallas in 1947, the same year Stone alleges that Nixon put him on the House payroll at Johnson’s request.

Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967, a little more than three years after killing Oswald.

Johnson died of a massive heart attack on January 22, 1973.

Nixon died on April 22, 1994, after suffering a severe stroke four days earlier.

'Behind closed doors': 'Nixon knew Jack Ruby, hired him on House payroll in 1947 at request of ... Lyndon Johnson,' Stone wrote on his Facebook page.
