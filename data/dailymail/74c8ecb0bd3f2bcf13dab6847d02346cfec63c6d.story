A Pennsylvania man has been charged with harassment for allegedly rubbing the stomach of a pregnant woman without her consent in what is being called the first case of its kind.

Richard J. Beishline, 57, went to his pregnant neighbor's trailer at about 5 p.m. on Oct. 20 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania..

While there, Beishline allegedly hugged the woman and touched her stomach against her wishes.

The woman pushed him away, police said.

When Beishline left to return to his trailer, the woman reported him.

Beishline was then charged with harassment in connection with the incident.

'Harassment': Richard J. Beishline, 57, seen here in a photo from Facebook, was reported to police for allegedly touching his pregnant neighbor inappropriately. It's the first known case of a controversial Pennsylvania law being applied

No touching: In Pennsylvania, a person can be charged with harassment for an action they take that has an intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, such as rubbing the stomach of a pregnant woman

In the state of Pennsylvania, a person can be charged with harassment for an action they take that has an intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person.

But rarely - if ever - has the law been applied to unwanted belly-touching and other physical contact aimed at pregnant women.

'Itâ€™s extremely rare and uncommon,' Pittsburgh attorney Phil DiLucente told NBC News.

'I have never heard or saw this ever being found.'

'This might be the first of its kind.'

It is not known how far along in her pregnancy the woman was at the time.

On his Facebook page, Beishline has listed himself as married.

Plenty of women have weighed in on the controversial law.

Jennifer Bosse, a mother of two and editor of the blog Defining My Happy, said it's a 'really tricky' situation

'Elderly grandmother that exclaims excitedly and touches your belly for the briefest of moments? Maybe mildly annoying but not a crime. Scary woman or man that grabs at your belly and continues to jiggle you around long after the first no? Crime,' Bosse said.

Richard J. Beishline is yet to respond to a harassment charge for allegedly feeling the stomach of his pregnant neighbor

Dani Mathes wrote on CNN's Facebook page: 'Annoying? Sure. Illegal? Heck no. We can't have laws for everything. We already complain about having so many laws for minor crap.'

Twitter has been abuzz with the story today.

'If he doesn't know her well, then he should not touch her,' said the person behind the handle @lizturn585859 on Twitter.

The charge is what is known as a summary offense in Pennsylvania, not a misdemeanor or a felony, and is typically disposed of with fines.

After a person is charged, a citation is issued where the individual can plead guilty and pay a fine or plead not guilty and scheduled a hearing in district court.

A magistrate in Cumberland County filed the harassment charge against Beishline.

Beishline has not responded to the charge.
