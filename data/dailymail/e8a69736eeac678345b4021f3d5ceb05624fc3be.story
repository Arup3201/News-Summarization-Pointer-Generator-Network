A new app taking music listeners directly to the most dramatic part of the song has been released by Spotify.

The Where is the Drama? app analyses songs' data to find the loudest crescendo, turning it into a 30-second sound clip.

It was developed at a 'hack day' in Berlin by Paul Lamere, director of developer community for The Echo Nest, Spotify's music intelligence division.

Where is the Drama? has found that the peak moment in Nirvana's hit Smells Like Teen Spirit comes after two minutes and 33 seconds

Nirvana's Kurt Cobain said they used a 'tension and release', quiet and loud formula for Smells Like Teen Spirit

Mr Lamere wanted to find out if a song's ability to strike a chord with a listener lies with its most dramatic section.

Indie band The Pixies were renowned for their 'soft-loud' dynamic because of songs like Gigantic, which has a long, quieter period before a sudden crescendo.

Nirvana's Kurt Cobain said The Pixies inspired the 'tension and release' formula for Smells Like Teen Spirit, and the same idea is used today by rock bands like the Foo Fighters and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

When downloaders use the app, it takes them directly to the most intense section of the song.

As some Led Zeppelin fans will know, listeners face five minutes and 20 seconds at a slower before Stairway to Heaven roars into life.

The app's analysis has confirmed this, while it has also found that the peak drama in Smells Like Teen Spirit comes after two minutes and 33 seconds.

The 'loudness curve' shown on Where is the Drama demonstrates where the 'drop' in the music is - where the sound decreases before an explosion of sound.

This technique is commonly used in drum and bass music, but the app shows it was common in rock songs of old.

Creator of the Where is the Drama? app Paul Lamere explained how the app worked on his blog. 

The app grabs the detailed audio analysis for the song and finds the 30-second period where volume increases the most, he said.

Extra weight is given to louder crescendos, so if two parts of a track increase in volume by 20 decibels, the louder of the two will be used for the sound clip. 

During the process of making the app, Mr Lamere realised that he would not be able to stop the track after the 30-second clip.

Instead, the app automatically switches to silent song 4’33 by John Cage after any clip is played. 

Mr Lamere said: 'The idea of the app is to find the epic moment, the dramatic moment, in the music.

'The app breaks down the song, looking at the volume throughout and finds the most dramatic increases.

'It's been a very popular download. Some people have been using it to find the most dramatic parts of movie soundtracks. It's also popular for dubstep, but there's a whole range.

'This is definitely a novelty app. It's a tongue-in-cheek app that takes you straight to your favourite part of the song. 

He added that the app could be used in future to help musicians work out at what point listeners get bored with a song and move on.

'People often just mix songs as loud as they can to grab the listener's attention,' Mr Lamere told the Independent. 

'The algorithm shows that music which has a diverse range of sounds and a wider use of dynamics sounds better.'

'Skipping straight to the dramatic bits is like a reader going to the final page of a mystery novel to find out who did it. 

'The app is a bit of a novelty but people can see whether the computer agrees with you about where the best, most dramatic section of a song is.'
