A 17-year-old rescue horse has been put down after an unknown assailant injected her with gasoline.

Jolean, a Paso Fino horse, initially had a spot of blood on her shoulder last Monday which her owner, John Hoogerhyde, believed to be an insect bite.

However the horse's neck began to swell and she was left bloated and in so much pain that she couldn't lie down. Two days later, she had to be put down at the small horse farm in Belleview, Florida.Â

Horse owner John Hoogerhyde, pictured, said that his beloved horse Jolean had to be put down last week after an unknown attacker injected her with gasoline at his Florida farm

The horse's shoulder where it was injected with gasoline. The blood spot initially looked like an insect bite but went on to swell and left the horse unable to stand. Jolean was put down last Wednesday

Mr Hoogerhyde told MailOnline today that he had rescued Jolean 18 months ago from a cruel farm where she was beaten and starved.

He said: 'It was a complete transformation, we had her loving people again.'

Mr Hoogerhyde kept Jolean and two other horses on his land on Southeast 55th Avenue Road  alongside a neighbor, who also has three horses.

He said: 'I noticed a blood spot on her shoulder last Monday but it looked like a bug bite. I gave her medication but she began to swell and bloat. Two days later, she couldn't stand and we had to take her to be put down.

'The vet who did the autopsy asked me: ''Did you pour gasoline on this horse?'' which I told him I would never do.

'The vet said the smell of gas when they opened Jolean up was overpowering.'

It is unclear how much gasoline Jolean had in her body as the chemical ate into the horse's tissue after it was injected.

Jolean was rescued from a cruel farm 18 months ago and nursed back to health by her owner John Hoogerhyde. She died last week after being injected with gasoline by a mystery assailant

Horse farmer John Hoogerhyde (pictured last week) told MailOnline today that he rescued Jolean just 18 months ago from a cruel owner and had no idea who would have killed her

Mr Hoogerhyde told MailOnline that he had no clue who would have wanted to harm the aging horse in this way.

'Our area is very quiet, with no break-ins and no trouble,' he said.

Mr Hoogerhyde's neighbor, Leah Greenleaf, also had her six-year-old horse Kate poisoned with gasoline.

Kate has undergone two surgeries after the chemical spread through her body and is awaiting a third to remove poisoned flesh. Mr Hoogerhyde said it was 'still up in the air' whether the horse would survive.

Mr Hoogerhyde has moved his two remaining horses off the property following the attacks.

The Marion County Sheriff's Department is investigating but initial searches of the property did not turn up any suspicious items.

A neighboring horse, six-year-old Kate, has undergone two surgeries after being poisoned with gasoline in a similar way to Jolean. It is still unclear if she will survive
