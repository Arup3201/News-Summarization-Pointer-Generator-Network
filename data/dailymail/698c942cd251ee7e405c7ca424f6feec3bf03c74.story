Prison term: Andrew Botto, 26, who tried to dodge a £100 fine but ended up with a five-year jail sentence after police found his cocaine stash

A van driver who tried to wriggle out of a small fine for using his mobile phone at the wheel ended up with a five-year jail sentence - after information stored on the device led police to his £365,000 cocaine stash.

Andrew Botto, 26, was stopped by traffic officers on road in Swansea after they noticed him using his phone while driving.

However, rather than accept an on-the-spot fine, Botto tried to convince the officers that they must have been imagining things – telling them that his mobile phone was actually at home.

But the police found the mobile on the back seat – and £3,000 cash in the glovebox, a court heard.

Becoming ever more suspicious, they searched through data on the mobile and found information that led them to a container positioned on a building site in Swansea where a kilogram of the class A drug - the size of a bag of flour - was found.

Prosecutor Geraint Walters said: ‘Botto was seen driving while on the phone and when he denied it the police smelled a rat.

‘Officers searched a number of properties linked to Botto, including a freight container on land he rented.

‘They used his keys to open the container where they found the drugs which weighed just less than 1kg.’

Swansea Crown Court heard the drugs were 66 per cent purity and could have earned the dealer £365,000.

Botto, who runs a small supermarket in Swansea, admitted possession of the Class A drug with intent to supply.

The court heard he had been asked to store the drugs and would have been paid when they were collected.

Judge Paul Thomas told him he had provided a ‘valuable service’ to the drug dealers and jailed him for five years.
