Women should be feminine, greet their husbands with a smile at the door after work and ask them what they want for dinner, a social commentator has claimed - sparking a bemused reaction from two female Today show hosts.

US author Susan Patton - also known as The Princeton Mom - dished out her tips for a happy marriage to women across Australia on Thursday, also prompting an angry response on social media.

'Men have been so trained… in ways to be sensitive to women's needs,' she told Today hosts Karl Stefanovic, Alicia Loxley and Sylvia Jeffreys.

Today's female co-hosts could not believe what they were hearing when Susan Patton (pictured) was a guest on the show

'There doesn’t seem to be anybody suggesting that men have any needs in this.'

'I’m just suggesting that it’s wise for the marriage that – for the sake of the family – for women to be sensitive to their husbands as well.'

'There’s nothing wrong with a woman saying to husband: "Honey, would you like a drink, what would you like for dinner, what can I do for you now?"'

The comments sparked hilarious reactions from Loxley and Jeffreys - who is dating co-host Karl's brother Peter - who both grimaced and shook their heads.

'I feel like you’re suggesting that we should be waiting on them,' Loxley said after Patton added that women should 'be nice' to their husbands and 'greet them with a smile' at the door when they come home from work.

Sylvia Jeffreys looked bemused by what Today show guest Susan Patton was saying

Karl Stefanovic cheekily agreed with his guest's advice - not so Alicia Loxley, who said it was 'archaic'

Patton says women should conform to traditional gender roles - a view clearly not shared by Jeffreys

'Most men who are the primary bread winners in their household, I think they’re entitled to respect when they walk in the door, I think they’re entitled to courtesy, appreciation,' Patton continued.

'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. It’s a very politically incorrect thing to say. That necessarily doesn’t make it incorrect.'

Sparkie_Gal was one of the people who hit out at Susan Patton's comments

@scouse_roar agreed with @Sparkie_Gal who tweeted it was 'horribly offensive'

But some defended Patton's comments like @FitterChick31

But Australia's lovable larrikin, Stefanovic, was eating up the preachings of Patton - getting a kick out of his female counterparts' reactions and saying he was a fan of her work.

'I concur with a lot of your research,' he said.

'I think you’re one of the wisest women in the world but convincing young women - or women of any age for that matter - that this is the right way of going is not an easy task because… I can hear them around Australia right now choking on their Weetbixs, throwing things at the TV.'

Co-host Alicia Loxley was equally unimpressed by Patton, saying: 'I feel like you're suggesting that we should be waiting on them'

But her co-host Stefanovic says he is a fan of Patton and she is 'one of the wisest women in the world'

Patton's comments also attracted strong opposition on social media.

@Sparkie_Gal tweeted: 'Pardon me but F**K [sic] off. I’m an electrician and extremely proud of it. Nothing feminine or traditional…'.

And @scouse_roar agreed: 'What a horribly offensive thing to say.'

But like all issues, people were divided.

'I do this everyday for my husband, just showing an interest in his day, its not archaic!!' @FitterChick31 wrote.
