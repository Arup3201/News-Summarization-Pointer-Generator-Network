An elderly pensioner claims her next door neighbour head butted her because she stroked his pet dog.

Constance Rimmer was left suffering black eyes and a badly bruised forehead for weeks allegedly after her altercation with Arti Fact.

The 84-year-old told Liverpool crown court she was hanging out a tea towel on the communal lawn she shared with Arti Fact while he was drinking whiskey at 5pm on March 26.

Black and blue: Constance Rimmer suffered huge bruises to her face and claims her 'neighbour headbutted' her

She said: 'He has a lovely little dog. It came across to me and I was stroking it.

'He said "leave my f-ing dog alone", but he said the full word. He bellowed it at me.'

She then described how she retreated to her door as bearded Fact, born Richard John Bailey, followed her while still shrieking at her.

Arti Fact is accused of attacking his 84-year-old neighbour because she stroked his dog

She said: 'He’s such a big gentleman. I put my hand out and got an umbrella from the stand. He said hit me hit me hit me.

'I managed not to. I just poked him with my umbrella that was when he head butted me.'

Fact, 46, of Southport, denied assault and branded Mrs Rimmer, who was left with appalling injuries, a 'nasty woman and a liar'.

He said she had probably hit herself with her umbrella during the altercation.

But Claire Jones, prosecuting, said he had previous convictions for punching three employees at McDonald’s in Southport and hitting a woman over the head with a walking stick, after an argument over a pram.

She said: 'You are a violent person and have been violent in the past.'

Fact, who has two hearing aids and uses a mobility scooter, replied: 'I have defended myself.'

Miss Jones replied: 'I am going to suggest that Mrs Rimmer is telling the truth and you are a liar.

'You have hurt her and head butted her while under the influence of alcohol.'
