Frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo let rip at Gareth Bale as Real Madrid slumped to their second defeat in four days and slipped behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in the La Liga title race

With Real trailing 2-1 in the closing moments at Sevilla, Ronaldo could not hide his frustration after £86million record signing Bale decided to take a free kick, instead of leaving it for the Portuguese forward, and lashed his effort over the bar.

Ronaldo was caught by TV cameras aiming a verbal volley at Bale.

It capped a dismal night for the 
Welshman, who was off the pitch changing his boots, leaving Real 
temporarily down to 10 men, as Carlos Bacca scored the winner in the 73rd 
minute.

Madrid's loss at the
 Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium came four days after they squandered a chance to 
effectively end Barcelona's title defence, with Lionel Messi out-duelling
 Ronaldo by scoring a hat trick for a thrilling 4-3 win in the Spanish 
capital.

Atletico Madrid 1 Granada 0

Barcelona 3 Celta Vigo 0

Sevilla 2 Real Madrid 1 

These consecutive losses came after Carlo Ancelotti's side had gone undefeated for 31 straight matches.

'We have to keep working, fighting and ask our fans for forgiveness,' said Madrid full back Marcelo.

'It's
 tough to do what we did, to keep winning for so many games. We have 
lost two games. They aren't more important, but they are critical. Now 
everything is much more difficult.'

Unhappy: Ronaldo can't hide his frustration as Real Madrid slip to defeat at Sevilla

Bacca was collecting tickets on local buses in his home town in his 
early twenties before he finally got his career on the right road.

The Colombian striker arrived at Sevilla for just £6m in the summer and
 has now scored 18 goals in all competitions this season.

He
 was the second-half hero scoring after a superb piece of skill from 
Ivan Rakitic. The Croatia midfielder flicked the ball over Pepe’s head
 and sent Bacca through. Pepe recovered to pursue the Sevilla forward 
but he was quicker to the loose ball and sent his shot through the legs 
of Diego Lopez to put his side 2-1 in front.

With Atletico Madrid beating Granada 
and Barcelona winning against Celta the result left Diego Simeone’s side
 top and Real third.

It
 was a particularly frustrating night for Bale, who picked up his fourth 
booking of the season and squandered several chances either side of 
half-time with wayward shooting.

Atletico lead
 the way at the top of the league on 73 points after Diego Costa's 63rd minute header was enough 
to give them all three points at home against Granada.

Barcelona are second on 72 points, with Madrid third on 70, but Barca's victory was marred by a serious injury to 
goalkeeper Victor Valdes which has likely ended his career with the club
 and ruled him out of the World Cup.

The
 32-year-old goalkeeper, who has long planned to leave the Nou Camp at 
the end of his contract in June, fell awkwardly while saving a free-kick
 from Fabian Orellana in the 22nd minute of the match, and could be seen
 crying as he left the pitch on a cart.

Barca confirmed an anterior cruciate ligament tear after the match.

'Victor
 Valdes suffered an ACL tear on 22 minutes after saving a free-kick,' 
the club said on their website. 'The club's medical services confirm 
that he will need surgery.'

Goals: Two goals from Neymar and one from Lionel Messi did the damage for Barcelona against Celta Vigo

Deadly: Diego Costa scored the winner for Atletico Madrid against Granada
