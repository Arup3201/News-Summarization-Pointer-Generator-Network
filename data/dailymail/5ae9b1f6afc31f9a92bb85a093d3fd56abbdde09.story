A fortnight ago, Tony Romo chipped two vertebrae. Now he looks set to play at Wembley.

The Dallas Cowboys (6-3) are desperate to arrest a two-game losing streak and will risk their divisive quarterback against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The 34-year-old, equally famed for thrilling fourth-quarter comebacks as he is for disastrous interceptions, has been told in no uncertain terms that he will return at the expense of back-up Brandon Weeden.

Charismatic owner Jerry Jones made that clear before leaving for England, while at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Friday head coach Jason Garrett said: ‘He looked pretty comfortable to me.’

Romo has a history of playing through the pain, and in 2011 managed to do so against the San Francisco 49ers with a punctured lung and a broken rib. He won the game, too.

But the injury is a notoriously painful one. Romo will be heavily padded and will struggle with mobility if he does suit up,

The Cowboys won’t want him to get hit, so expect their vaunted offensive line and the NFL’s leading rusher, DeMarco Murray to protect him.

Murray became the first player to rush for 100 yards in each of the first seven games of the season.

The bruising running back has 1,133 yards from 225 carries, and with the rejuvenating bye week to come, can expect a greater workload against a weak Jaguars run defense.

Romo has thrown a touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games and Dez Bryant will want to get back into form after a quiet few weeks.

The acrobatic wide receiver said he has ‘a little bit of extra juice’ since landing in England, so get set for fireworks as the Cowboys aim to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2009.

Meanwhile, are the Jaguars as bad as their 1-8 record suggests? In a word, yes.

The NFL’s youngest team, they possess an admirable head coach in the shape of Gus Bradley. But they will need to address points conceded (27.9) and yards per game (386.9) to trouble the W column.

They are good at hassling the quarterback, however. And with 27 sacks - joint third in the NFL - their front seven are capable of making life difficult for Romo.

In Blake Bortles, the third overall pick of this year’s draft, they have a rookie quarterback who has drawn comparisons with Ben Roethlisberger. But he is prone to errors of judgement and leads the NFL in interceptions with 13.

Blake Bortles has made some rookie mistakes this season, but he is being backed to turn it around long-term

Denard Robinson has been a quarterback, wide receiver and a cornerback before settling as a running back

Bortles has some exciting weapons in the shape of Cecil Shorts III and undrafted rookie Allen Hurns, who hauled in seven passes for 117 yards, scoring two touchdowns in last week’s 22-23 defeat to the Cincinnati Bengals.

And then there’s running back Denard ‘Shoelace’ Robinson, so called because he doesn’t tie them up. He will spearhead the ground game after averaging over 100 yards for the past three matches.

On paper, the Cowboys win. But on Wembley’s hybrid grass, will the Jaguars make the Cowboys regret their decision to risk Romo?
