Caroline Kennedy's recent attempt to stop her mother's letters from being auctioned off is just her latest effort to stop others from profiting off her family's legacy.

Caroline, who is the sole surviving member of former President Kennedy's direct family, stopped a batch of letters that her mother sent to an Irish priest from being sold at auction last month on the grounds that she has inherited her mother's copyright and therefore owns the letters that were sent to Father Joseph Leonard.

'The family got fed up of everybody making money off of the Kennedys,' author Laurence Leamer, who wrote a book called The Kennedy Women, told The Boston Globe.

Not for sale: A set of letters Jackie Kennedy wrote to a Catholic priest in Ireland have been pulled from auction after All Hallows College received complaints from the former first lady's family

'They want the control. They want the money. . . . They’re very protective, and they feel these repulsive journalists are trying to say anything to make a buck. That’s not totally untrue.'

Now more details have been revealed about how she was able to put an end to the sale, which would have helped a local college stay afloat during tough financial times.

The specific contents of the letters have been kept under wraps but they were sent from Jackie over the span of 15 years following the first time she met Father Joseph Leonard during a trip to Dublin in 1950.

In the 33 newly-discovered handwritten letters, amounting to some 130 pages, the famously tight-lipped Mrs Kennedy writes freely of her suspicions about JFK’s fidelity, her reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and anger at his tragic death.

Father Leonard worked at All Hallows College in Dublin, and the cash-strapped college found the letters in his belongings that he had gifted to the school when he died.

Fast friends: Jackie first met Father Joseph Leonard on a trip to Dublin in 1950. He chaperoned her during the trip, taking her to the theatre and out to the city's finest French restaurant

More roles: Caroline Kennedy serves as the protector of her family's legacy but she also is now the American ambassador to Japan, seen here at an event in Tokyo last week with actor George Takei and the Prime Minister's wife Akie Abe

In correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the White House, she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition ‘like Macbeth’.

Writing in 1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘a breed apart’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for attention.

Because the sale has been cancelled, the school will not receive the windfall from the auction which was expected to net about $4million, and they have been forced to close after 172 years.

The sale raised legal question of ownership, however, because even if the letters themselves were the property of the priest, who then passed that property on to the school, he never legally had the copyright to the material in the letters.

That copyright is generally believed to belong to the author themselves, which would be Jackie Kennedy in this case.

When she died in 1994, her will mandated that the copyright to all of her writings would fall in the hands of her two children.

'I request, but do not direct, my children to respect my wish for privacy,' her will stated.

When John Jr died in 1999, Caroline was given control of both of their estates.

In the latest drama surrounding the end of the Irish auction, the sellers did not immediately announce who put an end to the sale, saying only that members of the Kennedy family complained.

Now The Boston Globe has revealed that Kennedy family attorneys contacted Sheppard's Irish Auction House on May 21 saying that the sale could not go forward on the grounds that they own the copyright.

'It’s Caroline’s decision about what should happen... Whatever she would suggest I would agree to,' Jackie's stepbrother Hugh D. Auchincloss told The Globe.

Caroline, who is now serving as the American ambassador to Japan, has taken a hands-on role in the release of her mother's private thoughts.

The clearest example comes when an oral history Mrs Kennedy made was first not going to be released until 75 years after her death, but then Caroline surrepticiously released a book in 2011  detailing the transcriptions.

The sale of 130 pages of letters written by the former first lady to Father Joseph Leonard was called off after the Kennedy family intervened

@highlight

Lawyers for the family contacted the Irish auction house and argued that Caroline owns the copyright to the letters

@highlight

The letters themselves technically belonged to the priest, who gifted his belongings after his death to All Hallows College, where he taught

@highlight

But because Jackie Kennedy wrote the words in the letters, that falls under her copyright which is now controlled by her daughter Caroline

All Hallows College was hoping to make about $4million from the sale which would have kept them open but now the school is shutting down
