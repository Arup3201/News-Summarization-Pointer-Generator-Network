Sir Alex Ferguson threatened to sack his Manchester United players after their 2008 Champions League triumph, Patrice Evra has revealed.

The French defender recalls how Ferguson boarded the team bus after United’s penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, picked up the microphone and said: ‘Congratulations, but anyone who doesn’t want to win the Champions League again next year, I will rip up his contract!’

Speaking to UEFA’s Champions League Magazine, Evra admitted Ferguson’s response shocked him but that the legendary Scot instilled a winning mentality in the club.

He said: ‘I thought to myself, “We’ve just won the Champions League, he congratulates us for two seconds”.

‘Manchester United is a club with a winning culture. When you win a game it’s not fantastic, when you win the league it’s not fantastic, when you win the Champions League it’s not fantastic, it’s normal.

‘That’s the culture Sir Alex Ferguson imposed on Manchester United. For him, we were there to work and to win. That was the DNA of Manchester United.’

Evra explains how Ferguson told United's players on the bus back that he would tear up their contracts

The following year United lost 2-0 to Barcelona in Rome, and again 3-1 against the La Liga giants in 2011

Evra spent eight seasons at Old Trafford before joining Juventus in the summer and the 33-year-old also reveals former United team-mate Carlos Tevez urged him to come to Turin.

He said: ‘(Leaving United) was one of the toughest decisions of my career. It was easy to come to Juventus, because it is a great club, but it was difficult to leave United. When you play for United, you cannot get rid of the love you feel for the club.

‘(Carlos) is one of the reasons I chose Juventus. I talked to him on the phone and asked for a few tips, and he told me: “Come here, you will see it is a great club!” To see Tevez again, to play with him again, is really enjoyable.’
