A vintage Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sir Paul McCartney while The Beatles shot to international fame is expected to fetch more than £300,000 when it goes on sale tomorrow.

Sir Paul ordered the dark blue sports car in 1964 on the eve of the bands world tour and had it fitted with a black leather interior, Motorola radio and its very own record player.

The Aston Martin is one of 93 classic cars going under the hammer at 6.30pm tomorrow in an auction in Battersea Park, London, that is expected to bring in £18million and £20million.

Peter Wallman, who will be co-running the bidding for RM Auctions, said the fame of both the car and the owner made it a particularly special item.

Mr Wallman said: 'The Aston Martin DB5 is one of the most iconic cars in the world, driven by James Bond. And we’re talking about one of the most iconic super groups of the 1960s.

'We’ve sold a couple of cars owned by Steve McQueen which have sold for eight, nine, 10 times what they would be worth if they were just regular cars.

'I’m not going to predict that happening here but if somebody collects Beatles memorabilia and just really wanted to have Paul McCartney’s Aston Martin then it could go crazy.'

Sir Paul bought the car at a particularly important juncture in The Beatles’ career, coming just weeks after the band’s appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in America and the completion of filming A Hard Day’s Night.

The Aston Martin DB5 was delivered to the musician’s accountants when it left the factory in 3 July 1964 and became a regular feature of Sir Paul’s 1960s lifestyle, according to contemporary records.

A profile of the singer in Time magazine on 22 September 1927 noted: 'Bachelor Paul, 25 (his favorite (sic) ‘bird’ is 21-year old actress Jane Asher), is a movie addict, loves ‘the look of London’, and tools around town in a spiffy blue Aston Martin DB5'.

Roger McGuinn, the guitarist from rock band The Byrds, also remembers hitching a ride in the car during a tour of Britain in 1965.

'I went to Paul McCartney’s club in St James and he took me out for a drive around London in his Aston Martin DB5. It was a really amazing time', McGuinn once said, according to the auctioneer’s brochure.

It is believed Sir Paul eventually sold the car in 1970, having racked up 40,513 miles on the clock, according to service records. He has owned a number of other Aston Martins since.

George Harrison also owned a DB5 model, which sold for 464,000 US dollars in 2007, which would be £288,000 according to today’s exchange rate.

Also on sale at the auction is a 1998 Ferrari F300 Formula One racing car used by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.

The most expensive car being sold is 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Alloy Gullwing, one of only 29 ever produced, according to RM Auctions. It is expected to fetch between £2.7million and £3million.
