A benefits-claiming mother-of-11 who is moving into a taxpayer-funded mansion hired a private fairground ride worth hundreds of pounds for one of her children, it has been revealed.

Jobless Heather Frost, who has never done a day's work in her life, is said to have bragged to friends on social media about the extravagant treat, which she bought in the summer of 2011.

Miss Frost, 37, who is to be handed the keys to a so-called 'eco-home' later this year big enough to house her huge brood, managed to fund the party despite living on hand-outs.

The man who supplied the ride, William Danter, told MailOnline he arrived at Frost's current home in Chruchdown, Gloucs, and immediately decided he would only accept cash for the two-hour hire because of how 'scruffy' it was.

He said: 'We would usually accept cheques but because it was a roughish, scruffy house I said I wanted to be paid in cash. You can't be too careful.'

Despite the dilapidated appearance of the house, Mr Danter, who has run Billy Danter's Fun Fair for several years, said Frost's children were well-behaved during the two-hour visit.

'They came and watched us set-up and were excited. They were all quite scruffy but they were nice kids and polite.'

But Mr Danter, a father-of-two whose wife suffers from multiple sclerosis, had short-shrift for Frost's lifestyle and said it was a slap in the face for hard-working families.

He said: 'The (benefits) system is broken. It should be there as a safety net and to support people who need help, not for people to live on. You should have to work for your money, not work the system like this.

'You should only have the amount of kids that you are able to support - if I had more children I wouldn't be able to work as much.'

It was revealed this week how Miss Frost's lavish lifestyle has also extended to treating her current partner, 57-year-old James Martin, to flying lessons, while she even owns a horse and a £1,000 parrot called Jake.

Earlier this week her father waded into the row branding her 'lazy' and saying she needed to 'get off her backside' and get a job.

Royston Frost, 72, is angry and ashamed of his 
daughter and confessed he doesn’t even know the identity of
the fathers of two of his daughter’s 11 children.

‘I
didn’t tell my daughter to have 11 kids,’ he says. ‘I tried to stop her
at five, but you can’t tell someone in their 20s what to do.

‘Ever since she had her first child, she hasn’t been able to work because she’s had to look after all those kids.

‘She should have got off her backside and got a bloody job like the rest of us. She’s on all the benefits she can get.

‘Don’t get me wrong, she’s a good mum and her kids are always clean — she just has too many of them.

‘I
can’t stand what she’s become. She’s lazy. I didn’t raise her to be 
lazy. I’m not lazy. I’ve worked all my life until retiring five years 
ago.

‘The worst thing about
the whole mess is the horse. How the hell can she afford to keep a 
horse when some people struggle even to put food on the table?’

The council has knocked through two houses in Churchdown, Gloucs., to create a larger one for the family, who have lived there for five years

Country idyll: The former vicarage in the Forest of Dean where Benefit's mother Heather Frost used to live

Frost currently lives in two houses knocked together with her nine of her 11 kids.

But before that she used to enjoy a country idyll as resident of The Vicarage, where she had tenth child, Daisy, in March 2007.

The
secluded four-bedroom stone property sits at the end of a winding 
driveway and enjoys stunning views over the valley and former mining 
village of Lydbrook.

She had to move out when the house was sold by the Diocese of Gloucester for £307,000 in June 2008.

But a resident in the village said: 'We were glad to see the back of her, but I can't believe the council are building her a mansion.

'It's a joke. The benefits system is broken in this country.

'Hard-working people are paying for lazy people like her to bring up children who will probably be lazy too.'

Her new ‘eco-home’ is, to use estate agent speak, a stunning contemporary living space in a sought-after location.

The house, which is still a few 
months off completion, has six bedrooms, three bathrooms and a huge 
living/dining area, ideal for entertaining. 

The
rear of the £400,000 property offers
fine views over fields stretching to the Malvern Hills in the distance.

Heather, 37, has had eleven children (pictured), two of which have had kids of their own.

Following an appearance on daytime 
television to defend herself, Miss Frost has been lying low at the 
council property where the family currently live.

When the Mail called on Miss Frost 
earlier this week  she came to the door still wearing the make-up from 
her appearance on Daybreak, with pink hair and missing front teeth. She 
declined to be interviewed, saying she’d ‘had enough’ of all the fuss.
