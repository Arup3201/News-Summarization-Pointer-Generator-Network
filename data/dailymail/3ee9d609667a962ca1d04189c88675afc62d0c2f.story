A bride-to-be became pregnant after having sex with a dwarf stripper on her hen night, it has been claimed.

The woman had to confess to cheating on her husband with the adult entertainer earlier this year after giving birth to a baby with dwarfism at a hospital in Valencia, Spain, it was reported.

It is alleged that the woman’s husband believed the child was his until it was born. Neither the couple nor the hospital have been named.

Spanish news website Las Cinco del Dia (The Daily Five), which broke the story, said: ‘Neither her closest female friends nor her family knew she had had sex with the dwarf stripper.

‘But once she had her son in her arms, she broke down and confessed what had happened. As you can imagine no-one that sleeps with a stripper at her hen night broadcasts it, or at least they try to take their secret to the grave.

‘But the protagonist of this episode had no choice but to confess and could never have pretended the boy was her husband's because of a little problem - the child was born with dwarfism.’

A Spaniard working as a dwarf stripper, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘I know colleagues working out of Valencia but I'm not aware of any of them getting involved in something like this.

‘They're mostly men in their forties and fifties and who's going to want to sleep with a man that age. There must be about ten of us doing this line of work in Spain.

‘More often than not it's a joke thing and the women are very shy and don't even want you to touch them. You often go along with a normal stripper who blindfolds the woman and then you take his place and pretend it's him that's still dancing. 

'You take the blindfold off, congratulate her and go. At most you sometimes get asked to stay behind and have your picture taken with the bride-to-be. I'm astonished at the idea someone's fallen pregnant like this and the woman has managed to keep it a secret even from her closest friends.

‘It's certainly something that's catching peoples' interest. I've even had a call from a radio station in Uruguay earlier on but told them I couldn't help.’
