A report has exposed serious flaws in the way the NHS handles complaints

A report has exposed serious flaws in the way the NHS handles complaints with patients and families routinely being treated ‘insensitively’ and ‘without compassion’ by staff.

The Health Service Ombudsman warns that the system is ‘overly bureaucratic’ and ‘impersonal’ which ‘clashes’ with the needs of sick patients.

One woman who warned managers that her mother was not being washed nor helped to the toilet was told to submit a complaint in writing which would be ‘acknowledged within 28 days.’

She said: ‘My mum could have died in that amount of time.’

Another elderly patient who tried to raise concerns was put off ‘brusque’ receptionists who refused to hand him a complaint form.

He said: ‘Some of the reception staff are very brusque and fail to make eye contact. 

‘It is as if it is such an everyday occurrence that it is not worth their while bothering to explain or take it further.’

‘I might have pursued it further if a complaint form had been offered, or if I had been given advice of the “how to and who to complain to” variety.’

Dame Julie Mellor, Health Service Ombudsman said: ‘We know the process can be overly bureaucratic and impersonal, clashing with the needs of the unwell patient who simply wants to be heard, understood and have things put right simply and quickly.

‘People complain because they want to know what has gone wrong, they want an apology and they want to make sure others don’t suffer the same problems. 

‘We see example after example of cases where hospitals aren’t using complaints as the vital source of feedback they are. Learning from patients, improving services and building trust all flow from managing complaints effectively.’

The Health Service Ombudsman investigates serious complaints from patients and relatives which haven’t been properly dealt with by hospitals.

Last year it looked into 400 cases and found ‘serious flaws’ in the way they had originally been handled.

Its
report warned that hospital staff fail to listen to patients and 
families who raise concerns and do not make any attempt to put things 
right.

In some cases staff will even make ‘blatant attempts’ to cover-up their mistakes by falsifying patient records.

The daughter of one elderly man who complained about his care said there were ‘discrepancies’ between what she was being told.

She said: ‘Not consulting my father or I was both disempowering and insensitive.

‘The deeper the investigation went the more discrepancies became apparent.

‘I was concerned that other elderly people might encounter similar experiences and would like to prevent more serious outcomes for those who do not have relatives to advocate on their behalves.’

Just two months ago a damning report into Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal where hundreds died from neglect warned of a ‘culture of secrecy’ across the NHS.

The Government is now trying to make the health service more open by encouraging staff to raise concerns of poor care and make it easier for relatives to complain.

And Labour MP Ann Clywd has been appointed to carry out a review of the complaints system after she witnessed the appalling treatment of her husband in hospital in Cardiff.

She told the Commons last year how her beloved Owen Roberts died ‘like a battery hen’ after her repeated pleas for nurses to help him were ‘brushed aside’.
