Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has warned the club's fans they will have to get used to a more patient style of football under Louis van Gaal than they experienced during the glory years of Sir Alex Ferguson.

Carrick, 33, has acknowledged a clear shift in United's tactical approach under van Gaal whose side have only scored twice in their last three games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Crystal Palace after a thrilling but chaotic start to the season which saw them beaten 4-0 by MK Dons and 5-3 at Leicester City.

Under Ferguson, Old Trafford became known as The Theatre of Dreams and the fans were used to having their chants of 'Attack-attack-attack' listened to.

But the midfielder says it will be different while van Gaal is at the club, saying the Dutchman will do things his way despite the summer arrival of attacking stars like Angel di Maria and Falcao.

'The philosophy is different in that he is happy for us to keep the ball for long spells to get in the game, and get rhythm in our game,' said Carrick.

'Whereas before, especially at home with the crowd as well, it's always been a case of trying to attack as quickly as possible with speed and penetration, and even if you give the ball away a few times, keep trying it.

'It's just a different way of approaching the game really, there is no right or wrong, just different beliefs I suppose.

'It's fine for the players, we adapt, we see it every day and are learning all the time. It is more for the fans as well, to appreciate it and to be fair, they have been great.

'Sometimes when you are keeping the ball, they might think they want us to put it straight into attack. But there is a meaning to it as well, it's not like we are just keeping the ball for the sake of it. So that is something we all have to get used to.

'The manager is obviously firm in what he wants and the standards he's got. It is up to us to hit them really and if we don't, he lets us know which is fine. That is the way it should be.

'I think the secret of being a manager at that level as he has been for a number of years is to know when to have that strong aura, and when to be more friendly and approachable. You need that barrier because that is what creates the respect and get people to respond to you.'

Van Gaal has deployed Wayne Rooney in midfield to give the team a more solid look and sees Carrick's role in front of the back four as key, though he will probably miss next Saturday's trip to Arsenal after suffering a groin strain on England duty and joining a lengthy United injury list that also includes Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo and David de Gea.

It is a blow to Carrick who only recently returned after damaging ankle ligaments in pre-season training during van Gaal's first week at the club.

'It was pretty much his first day when I got injured, so it wasn't ideal!' he admits.

'The most I'd ever been out for before was five or six weeks. It is frustrating, especially the older you get, you don't want to miss much, you never know how long you've got. Not that I am looking towards the end just yet, but you never know.

'But then I've looked at it, and thought I've had a good run, I've been lucky enough through the years that I've never been out for so long.

'I just went over on the ankle. I sort of changed direction, lost my balance, my foot gave way and then, crunch.

'It was painful and then the pain went away so I almost thought it might not be that bad. Then I went for the scans and realised.'

United are currently seventh in the table, exactly where they ended up under David Moyes last season, and Carrick wants to see the team climbing up the table quickly.

'We have had ups and downs but hopefully that is in the past, that is over. We don't want too many ups and downs, we certainly don't want any downs,' he said.

'We want to try and keep progressing, we feel like we are but as I said before it's results that show so now is the time we really need to get a run of results together, to build the momentum to get up that league.'
