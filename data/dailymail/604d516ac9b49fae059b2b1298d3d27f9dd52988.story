At first glance, they appear to be the sort of pictures that grace any family album — but look a little closer.

Two of the faces are very familiar — and they usually bear scowls rather than smiles. They belong to none other than two of Britain's most feared gangsters: Ronnie and Reggie Kray.

Since their heyday in the Fifties and Sixties, 'the twins', as they were known, have become synonymous with a sleazy sort of spurious glamour. They have become almost iconic figures who transcended the worlds of entertainment, politics and vicious criminality in which they moved.

These previously unseen pictures, which feature in a new book on the brothers, were drawn from the private collections of friends of the Krays.

In them, we see the twins surrounded by their childhood pals such as 'Chunky' Morgan, and friends they made later, such as 'Big Pat' Connolly, a valued member of the Krays' gang, which went by the euphemistic name of 'the Firm'.

We also see them in their later years, enjoying the life made possible by the proceeds of their crimes.

Study these snapshots for any length of time and the menace in the scenarios they record becomes apparent.

In one, a brilliantined Reggie and Ronnie and a gang of what they would undoubtedly call 'associates' affect an uneasy bonhomie in some East End drinking den. But, one senses, the laughs won't last.

The twins, clutching halfs of bitter, exude a sense of dead-eyed threat, the hint of a sneer curling around their lips.

Big Pat, in the centre of the picture, sizes up a gap-toothed, grinning hanger-on, perhaps assessing whether he is 'taking liberties' and needs 'sorting'.

Big Pat was a Glaswegian who met Reggie when the two men were on remand in Brixton Prison. He was soon given a job as a doorman at the Krays' Double R club in the East End.

'Pat's weight was between 17 and 18st and could he could punch his weight,' Reggie later recalled. 'He had a couple of scars on his face due to various battles he had been in, and when he and Limehouse Willy were fighting side by side they were a good team to have on one's side.'

In another picture, conveying all the grit and grime of the old East End, the twins stand in front of a ramshackle fence in a back alley in Bethnal Green. A bored-looking  Reggie holds their brother Charlie's son, Gary. Ronnie — hands thrust deep in his pockets, tie tightly knotted but askew — glares moodily at the photographer.

In another shot, Chunky Morgan demonstrates his prodigious strength by holding aloft two gang members. Like the Krays, Chunky was born in Bethnal Green and into villainy. His father had been imprisoned for taking part in a raid on a warehouse where he was employed as a security guard. Chunky and his brother Dickie were great friends of the Krays, and Chunky's girth proved useful in many a gangland scrap.

A habitual criminal, he eventually  graduated from borstal to Parkhurst prison.

The Krays themselves were almost born to a life of crime. Their father, Charlie senior,

was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the World War II he was called up to join the Army, but deserted.

Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father.

It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition.

However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet in Somerset.

Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot.

In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and — ultimately — murder.

Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept.

Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair.

Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear.

In the middle of 1968, the twins disappear from the family album, for the simple reason that they and older brother Charlie were arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders.

Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie.

The next time the brothers were photographed together was not for any family album, but for the newspapers, when they were allowed out of prison to attend their mother's funeral in 1982. Their father died a year later, and by 2000, both the twins and their brother had followed him.

The Krays' family album may be full of memories but, one suspects, very few of them are happy.
