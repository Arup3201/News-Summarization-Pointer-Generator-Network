Gus Poyet will attempt to arrest Sunderland’s slide by axing goalkeeper Vito Mannone - while former England winger Adam Johnson is also under threat.

The Black Cats have slumped in to the relegation zone after losing their last two – 8-0 at Southampton at 2-0 at home to Arsenal – and Poyet is promising changes for Monday’s trip to Crystal Palace.

Ex-Arsenal stopper Mannone was guilty of errors which gifted goals to the opposition in both of those defeats and Costel Pantilimon – a free-transfer signing from Manchester City in the summer – is set to come in for his Premier League debut.

Premier League 2014/15

Appearances: 9

Goals conceded: 17

Clean sheets: 2

Former Arsenal stopper conceded eight goals in one match against Southampton 

And Poyet said: ‘Normally I don’t change the keeper when they have a bad game.

‘Sometimes, you need to accept mistakes in the overall performance be it from a keeper, a manager or a No. 9.

‘But if it’s two bad games, then he starts to have a problem.’

Johnson, meanwhile, was recalled for the Arsenal game but again failed to impact, and Poyet hinted that he too could be benched.

‘We can debate if Jonno needs to play or doesn’t need to play, or if Vito Mannone needs to play or doesn’t need to play,’ he said.

Johnson’s only hope of a reprieve are the injuries to wingers Ricky Alvarez and Emanuele Giaccherini.

Adam Johnson could also face the chop having failed to make an impact in the home clash against Arsenal
