Speedball Tiggy Wiggy is poised to try to win two Group One prizes in eight days, with trainer Richard Hannon indicating his Cheveley Park Stakes heroine is likely to run in the Prix de L’Abbaye at Longchamp a week on Sunday.

After she beat Anthem Alexander by three-quarters of a length, Coral make the flying filly 7-2 favourite to become the first two-year-old winner of all-age Abbaye since Sigy in 1978.

The big question is whether regular jockey Richard Hughes will be able to ride. The 8st 4lb, who will be allocated against older sprinters, is 2lb below the lightest he has managed in the last 12 months.

But the champion jockey argued that even putting up a little overweight might be worth it, given his partnership with Tiggy Wiggy.

Hughes, who reckons Tiggy Wiggy is the fastest two-year-old he has ridden, added: ‘If I would have to carry too much overweight, I would be the first one to say you are better off getting someone else.

‘But if I was within 2lb, I would like to keep the ride.’

Tiggy Wiggy, who has now twice avenged her Queen Mary Stakes defeat at Royal Ascot at the hands of Anthem Alexander, has won six of her eight races this year, including York’s Lowther Stakes.

She has been beaten only when not allowed to utilise her blistering pace from the stalls. The tactical lesson has been learnt.

Hannon said: ‘She is two-year-old of the year for me. That was a very good Cheveley Park and a very good Lowther she won. They are the best fillies around.’

Asked about the French raid, Hannon said: ‘The Abbaye comes at a good time, there are no great Breeders’ Cup options. She is in great form. We’ll go there.’

The other big two-year-old race on the Newmarket card, the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes, was won by Andrew Balding’s Elm Park. He could run in Doncaster’s Racing Post Trophy next month and will be campaigned as a Derby prospect.
