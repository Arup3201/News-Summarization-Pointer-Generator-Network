A police officer was attacked and knocked unconscious in the street when he approached a gang of youths.

The PC was on patrol in Preston, Lancashire, when he went to speak to a group of ten youths when he was hit from behind and knocked to the ground.

A member of the public alerted his colleagues shortly after the assault on Saturday and he was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital where he later regained consciousness.

Brutal: The attack happened in Avenham, close to the centre of Preston (pictured)

The police officer suffered cuts and bruises after he was hit from behind

He was treated for cuts and bruises to his face and is now recovering at home, Lancashire Constabulary said.

Seven men have been arrested in connection with the assault at about 8pm in the Duke Street and Albyn Bank Road area of Avenham.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Dawson from Lancashire Police said it was a 'disgraceful attack' against a 'highly respected officer'

The suspects, aged between 14 and 32, all from the Preston area, were arrested on suspicion of wounding and have been bailed.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Dawson 
from Lancashire Police said: 'This was a disgraceful incident against a 
highly respected police officer who was simply doing his job and trying 
to keep the community safe.

'Our investigation is still ongoing and a number of other people are actively being sought.'

He called on anyone who was in the area at the time of the attack to come forward.

He
added: 'Fortunately incidents of this nature are rare but they will not
be tolerated and we need the public's help to bring those responsible 
to justice.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
