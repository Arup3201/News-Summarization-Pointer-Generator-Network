Microsoft's Windows 9, the successor to the widely criticised Windows 8, will be unveiled on September 30th, it has been claimed.

Currently codenamed Threshold, it is expected to include a 'mini' Smart Menu and separate Windows for its controversial Metro-style 'tile' applications.

Earlier this year Microsoft was forced to bring back its Start menu after users complained they were confused by its Windows 8 'tile' interface.

Windows 9 is expected to feature  a new 'mini' Smart Menu

It will have separate windows for Metro-style 'tile' applications running on the desktop

Microsoft is also planning to remove its charms, an overlay used to access search, share, the Start Screen, devices, and settings.

It will also include Cortnana, a new virtual assistant similar to Apple's Siri. 

The new software will be shown off at the end of next month, according to The Verge. 

The date is currently 'tentative,' according to the report.

'The Threshold version of Windows is currently in development and Microsoft plans to release a preview version of what will likely be named Windows 9 to developers on September 30th or shortly afterwards,' the site claims. 

Last week, ZDNet reported that Microsoft is planning to launch a 'technology preview' of Threshold at the end of September or early October. 

Users will be able to try out the operating system, but would need to have software updates automatically downloaded to the platform each month.

The firm is hoping it can undo some of the damage done by windows 8, which was poorly recieved among consumers.

'Threshold is expected to include a number of new features that are aimed at continuing to improve Windows' usability on non-touch devices and by those using mice and keyboards alongside touch,' according to ZDNet

Microsoft hoped the Metro system, which uses tiles, would make it easier for touchscreen users.

Microsoft hoped the Metro system, which uses tiles, would make it easier for touchscreen users.

It is the same across Microsoft's phones, tablets and PCs.

However, many users were confused, and Microsoft recently reinstated the classic start menu on its desktop.

The new software will also include a Siri-like personal assistant. 

Microsoft formally announced earlier this year it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.

The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive.

The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones and desktops.
