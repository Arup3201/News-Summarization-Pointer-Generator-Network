Vicious: Cindy Whisman was killed by her daughter's pit bull Polo on Monday in front of her two-year-old grandson Marcus

Interned: Polo the pit bull is with the Butler County Animal Friends Humane Society and a decision has yet to be made on his future

Witness: Julie Whisman said that her two-year-old son Marcus has not exhibited any worrying signs of trauma after witnessing his grandmother's mauling by the family pit bull

'As far as I know my neighbor told me she saw her and the dog outside,' said Julie Whisman to WCPO.

'She thought they were playing back and forth like this, then all of a sudden she saw her on the ground and kept saying 'Polo, Polo,' because that was the dog's name, and she was rolling over, so the neighbor called 911 and then she didn't see her no more.'

Neighbor, Wayne Walker tried to save Cindy Whisman from the dog, but told WCPO that he failed to get to her in time.

'Whenever I hit him he yelped and took off running straight into their house,' Walker said. 'I looked at Cindy Whisman... she's gone.'

Scene: This is Julie Whisman's backyard where Polo attacked Cindy Whisman and killed her on Monday

Distraught: Julie Whisman said that she couldn't believe her family pet, Polo, would turn on her mother with fatal results

According to the sheriff's office Cindy Whisman was mauled across her face, neck and abdomen and they confirmed her grandson was in the backyard when the vicious attack occurred.

Julie Whisman said that she could not believe that Polo attacked her mother and said she has owned him since he was a puppy.

'It just doesn't add up to me,' she said to WCPO. 'My son could sit on him, lay on him.'

Devastated, Julie said her mother's loss has hit her hard.

'She was my best friend, she was the greatest person to me,' Julie said of Cindy.

Cindy said that her son did not seem to be too affected by the attack, but that time will tell

Polo the Pit Bull has been taken to the Butler County Animal Friends Humane Society.

It is not clear whether the dog will be destroyed and that will not become an option until the sheriff's investigation is complete.
