Medical marvel: Doctors described Stephen Thorpe, 21, as 'truly a unique case' after he awoke from a coma following a multiple car crash that left him needing a machine to stay alive

They were told there was no chance of their son surviving after he suffered devastating injuries in a car crash.

But Steven Thorpe’s parents refused to give up hope – despite four specialists declaring that the 17-year-old was brain dead.

Convinced they saw a ‘flicker’ of life
 as Steven lay in a coma, John and Janet Thorpe rejected advice to 
switch off his life support machine.

They begged for another opinion – and it was a decision that saved him.

A neurosurgeon found faint signs of 
brain activity and two weeks later, Steven woke from his coma. Within 
seven weeks, he had left hospital.

And four years on, the trainee accounts clerk says he owes everything to the persistence of his parents.

From his home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Steven, 21, said: ‘I feel so lucky that my parents wouldn’t take no for an answer.’

The schoolboy was travelling in a 
Rover with two friends in February 2008 when a stray horse ran into the 
path of the car in front of them.

His friend Matthew Jones, 18, was 
killed in the accident. Steven suffered serious injuries to his face, 
head and arm, and was declared brain dead two days later.

He said: ‘The doctors were telling my 
parents that they wanted to take me off the life support. The words they
 used to my parents were “You need to start thinking about organ 
donations”.

‘I think that’s what gave my dad 
energy. He thought “No way”. They still believed I was there. When they 
sat around the bed they had the feeling I was there and some words they 
said to me I reacted to.

‘I think if my dad had agreed with them then I would have been off the life support machine in seconds.’

Accountant Mr Thorpe, 51, contacted 
private GP Julia Piper, known for her work in traditional and 
alternative medicines. Moved by their story, she asked a neurosurgeon 
whom she knew to visit Steven at University Hospital in Coventry.

Incredibly, he concluded that Steven was not brain dead and that there was still a slim chance of recovery.

Doctors agreed to try to bring Steven 
out of his chemically-induced coma to see if he could survive. Two weeks
 later, he woke up.

He said: ‘It’s very worrying to think that more than one specialist had written me off.

‘Hopefully it can help people see that
 you should never give up. If you have a gut feeling about something 
then follow it. My father believed I was alive and he was correct.’

Steven, who has three sisters, has 
lost the use of his left arm and has undergone extensive reconstructive 
surgery to his face, including having his nose rebuilt and an artificial
 eye socket made.

But despite his injuries, he says he considers survival as ‘a full recovery’.

He said the experience was still ‘too 
painful’ for his parents to talk about, and yesterday Mr Thorpe told the
 Daily Mail that he would rather ‘keep it in the past’.

Dr Piper, who has a practice in 
Leicester, said: ‘As a parent, I wanted to help even if there was only 
the smallest of chances. I spoke to the intensive care unit and told 
them not to switch Steven’s machine off because we were bringing in our 
own specialist.

‘I am astonished with the outcome but one worries that this may happen more often than we know.’

A spokesman for University Hospitals 
Coventry and  Warwickshire NHS Trust  said: ‘The injury to Steven’s 
brain was extremely critical and several CT scans of the head showed 
almost irreversible damage.

‘It is extremely rare that a patient 
with such extensive trauma to the brain should survive. We were 
delighted to see Steven recover.’
