A faithful dog has refused to leave the side of his dead master's grave for six years, it was reported today.

German shepherd Capitan ran away from home after the death of Argentinian Miguel Guzman in 2006.

A week later Mr Guzman's family went to pay their respects and found the heartbroken pet sitting by his owner's grave, wailing.

Loyal: Capitan has not left the side of Miguel Guzman's grave since 2006 - and sleeps on top of it every night

Since then the grieving dog has rarely left the spot at the cemetery in the town of Villa Carlos Paz, central Argentina.

Mr Guzman bought Capitan as a present for his 13-year-old son Damian in 2005.

He died suddenly in March the next year, but by the time his family had returned home from the funeral Capitan was gone.

Mr Guzman's widow Veronica told Argentina's Cordoba newspaper: 'We searched for him but he had vanished. We thought he must have got run over and died.

'The following Sunday we went to the cemetery and Damian recognised his pet. Capitan came up to us, barking and wailing, as if he were crying.'

She added: 'We had never taken him to the cemetery so it is a mystery how he managed to find the place.

'We went back the next Sunday, and he was there again. This time, he followed us home and spent a bit of time with us, but then went back to the cemetery before it started getting dark.

'I don't think he wanted to leave Miguel on his own at night.'

Protector: Although it has been six years since Mr Guzman's death Capitan proves a faithful companion and guards his grave day and night

Here to stay: Mr Guzman's son Damian has tried to bring Capitan home but he always runs back to the cemetary in Villa Carlos Paz

The cemetery's director Hector Baccega remembers the day he first saw the dog.

He said: 'He turned up here one day, all on his own, and started wandering all around the cemetery until he eventually found the tomb of his master.

'During the day he sometimes has a walk around the cemetery, but always rushes back to the grave. And every day, at six o'clock sharp, he lies down on top of the grave stays there all night.'

Mr Baccega said staff at the cemetery are now feeding and taking care of Capitan.

Mr Guzman's son Damian said: 'I've tried to bring Capitan home several times, but he always comes straight back to the cemetery. I think he's going to be there until he dies too. He's looking after my dad.'

The story is similar to that of Hachiko, an Akita who is said to have waited at a Tokyo train station for its master to return each day for nine years from May 1925, following owner Hidesaburo Ueno's death at work.
