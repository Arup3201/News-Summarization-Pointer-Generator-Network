Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, pictured, has been jailed for a year this morning

After dozens of trials, hundreds of allegations and innumerable delaying tactics, the law caught up with Silvio Berlusconi yesterday when he was sentenced to a year in prison.

But even now the former Italian prime minister won’t have to serve any time in jail – because he’s too old.

Italian sentencing guidelines dictate that those over 75 are almost always spared jail.

Berlusconi is 76.

The billionaire media mogul was convicted of violating secrecy laws by publishing transcripts of phone calls tapped by the police.

His brother, Paulo, 63, received a sentence of two years and three months.

Paulo edits Il Giornale, which published the transcripts in an attempt to discredit the Centre-Left.

Silvio Berlusconi owns the newspaper.

The guilty verdict comes after inconclusive elections left Italy with a hung parliament.

He has been taken to court 100 times but has rarely been convicted.aces two other trials for alleged tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute.

Berlusconi, who had denied any wrongdoing, can seek to have the decision overturned before a court of appeal.

Under Italian law, he is not expected to serve any prison term until all possible appeal trials have been carried out.

The case had been delayed after judges accepted a plea from Berlusconi's defence team to postpone while he ran for re-election in the Italian general election last month.

His defence team had accused the court of seeking a speedy verdict for political impact.

But the verdict carries no impact on Berlusconi's eligibility to participate in a new government.

His center-right coalition finished third in parliamentary elections that saw now clear winner.

Delay: The case was postponed earlier this year when judges accepted a request from Berlusconi's defence team to delay it as he campaigned for the Italian general election

Talks on forming a new government are expected to begin March 20.

The charge originated after an investigation into the failed takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol in 2005.

The bid was rejected by Italy's central bank and contributed to the forced resignation of then-Bank of Italy chief Antonio Fazio.

Silvio Berlusconi is currently appealing another conviction.

In October, Berlusconi was sentenced to a year in jail in a tax fraud case.

A verdict is said to be close in that appeal, with prosecutors demanding that the four-year sentence be upheld.

They are also seeking that he be banned from public office for five years.
