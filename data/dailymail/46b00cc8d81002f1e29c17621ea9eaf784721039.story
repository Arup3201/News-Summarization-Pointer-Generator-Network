Maintenance work on New York City transit systems ground to a halt Saturday as authorities widened the frantic search for a mute, 14-year-old autistic boy who vanished from his school last week.

Surveillance footage from Avonte Oquendo’s Long Island City, Queens school shows him dashing down a hall and out the door around noon on October 4.

Two hundred maintenance workers combed the city’s tunnels in search of the boy, who is fascinated by trains and has been found wandering the dangerous paths three times before.

Missing: Avonte Oquendo is mute and autistic. He vanished October 4 from his Long Island City school in Queens, New York. Subway workers fanned out Saturday in search of the boy, who is fond of trains and has been fond wandering the tunnels before

New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told NBC New York on Friday that 50 officers are now assigned to the case per day and citywide alert has been extended to Long Island and New Jersey.

Several promising leads have failed to produce any results in the case, keeping both hope and disappointment very much alive.

On Sunday, the reward for Avonte's return had reached $70,000.

Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn Saturday around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot.

‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’

Surveillance footage from his school shows Avonte dashing down a hallway and out the door October 4. The search for the boy has now spread across New York City and into outlying areas of Long Island and New Jersey

Hopeful: Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives to a vigil October 11 in Queens. Social media has continued to churn up leads in the case, but the boy remained missing Sunday morning

Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search.

Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese.

‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’

Vigilant: A vigil was held Saturday as the search continued for Oquendo, with a focus on the areas in and around where Avonte was last seen in Long Island City, Queens

Hopeful: Two hundred transit workers fanned out on Saturday and thousands of other volunteers online and on the ground continued to help in the search Sunday. Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on Saturday

Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name

On the ground, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home.

'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.'

Sunday morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared.

‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’

Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt. He is 5-foot-3 and weighs 125 pounds. Anyone with information is urged to call the NYPD Crime Stoppers line at 800-577-TIPS.
