Opening your GCSE results is stressful enough.

But a pair of 16-year-old students had double the pressure, as they read their results while cradling their new born twins.

Six-week-old Elizabeth and twin sister Victoria witnessed new parents Kyle Wiggins and Leighanne Crampton pick up their grades.

Six-week-old Elizabeth and twin sister Victoria were on hand to witness parents Kyle Wiggins and Leighanne Crampton pick up their grades

During the 13 weeks leading up to their birth, Kyle and Leighanne had to go to hospital every day - severely damaging their attendance at school

The students have endured a stressful couple of months but that was not caused by the dreaded wait for results.

The Park Community School pupils in Havant, Hampshire, who only discovered Leighanne was pregnant when she was four months gone, learnt their daughters' may not survive because of a dangerous foetal condition.

The condition, called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, occurs when one twin gets all the nutrients.

It meant that during the 13 weeks leading up to their birth, Kyle and Leighanne had to go to hospital every day - severely damaging their attendance at school.

When they were born, the twins had to stay in hospital for a further four weeks after being born by caesarean section at just 33 weeks.

But they're now living with Leighanne's parents, brother and sister at home.

Despite missing a lot of time off school, teachers were in no doubt that they would both do well

Leighanne said: 'It's amazing to have them home.

'I'm happy with my results but if I hadn't had so much drama I could've done even better!

'We had both planned our future after school and I had a place lined up to be an apprentice travel agent.

'I also had an interview for an accountancy apprenticeship when I found out I was pregnant.

'It was a real shock because I was already 16 weeks gone but a few weeks later the doctors told us to get ready to go to London because the twins had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.'

Leighanne, known as Lilly, took eight GCSEs, scoring two Bs in geography and IT and a further six Cs.

She also collected a distinction in a BTEC course in travelling and tourism and intends to start an apprenticeship as soon as she is able.

Meanwhile, boyfriend Kyle took nine GCSEs, picking up two Bs and seven Cs, securing his place on an engineering apprenticeship.

He said: 'I've always loved cars and been interested in how they work so an engineering apprenticeship was just the right thing.

'I was worried for a bit when we first found out Lilly was pregnant but I knew we would work our way round it.

'I want to get the best job I can to provide for Lilly and the kids. They are just perfect.'

Despite missing a lot of time off school, teachers were in no doubt that they would both do well.

Stuart Cavanagh, who is in charge of student progress, said: 'They're both very good students who have worked hard despite a rather complicated year.

'Both did well and they're very well adjusted pupils who are looking to carry on with their education and make the very best of their lives.'

Elizabeth was the 'donor' twin which meant, in the womb, her sister was taking all of her nutrients too.

She was born weighing 3lbs 12ozs and has a hole in her heart, which requires regular medical attention, but is otherwise healthy.

Victoria was born weighing 4lb 12oz and is thriving.
