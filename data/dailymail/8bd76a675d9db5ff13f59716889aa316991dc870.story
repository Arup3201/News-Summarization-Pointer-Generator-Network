A Virginia mother was outraged after a picture she posted on Instagram of her children became a focus for cruel and insulting comments.

For Father's Day, Ciara Logan had put a picture online of her eight-year-old son and twin daughters aged 2.

But what should have been a happy family photo quickly became a magnet for inappropriate comments after a stranger turned the photo into a meme.

Ridiculed: An Instagram user turned what should have been a cute family picture into a cruel internet meme

Ms Logan only realized what had happened after noticing she had a new follower on Instagram. When she scrolled through that person's images, she saw her children's picture.

The photo showed her children smartly dressed, with her son in a white suit and blue shirt, and the twins wearing cute summer dresses.

But an unknown Instagram user had added a quote from The Color Purple under the image, saying: 'Harpo just won't let them girls be'.

Underneath the meme, others had joined in the cruel joke, adding a series of insulting hashtags that suggested Ms Logan's son was a pimp, or that made light of the missing schoolgirls in Nigeria.

Ms Logan told CBS 6 she was upset by the mocking comments which 'insinuate my son is a pimp, or is 
selling cars, because he has on a suit and has two little girls with him
 - or to hashtag, "keep him away from those girls", as if to say he's a 
predator'.

'He's an 8-year-old boy who is very caring, very loving, very nourishing, very protective of his sisters.' she added.

Shocked: Ciara Logan was upset to discover a picture of her children had been turned into a internet joke

The mother-of-three tried to contact the Instagram user who had altered her family photo, but he blocked her, changed his name and moved his account settings to private.

Instagram was also unable to help, advising the mother to simply remove all pictures of her children as a precaution, and to make her account private.

Ms Logan said the incident had opened her eyes to the problems of the internet, and warned other parents to be more cautious.

''Get a page that is for family only and 
private your page,' she said.

The children's grandmother, Louse Logan, was also upset by the image, telling CBS: 'To have someone display my grandchildren, with so much negative connotations and distastefulness ... I was just in awe, and it needs to stop.'
