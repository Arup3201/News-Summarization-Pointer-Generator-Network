David Cameron and Nick Clegg were accused of 'doing an Obama' after making separate whistle-stop visits to Stonehenge today.

The Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader stopped for photos at the world famous site to highlight a £15 billion road expansion.

It comes after the US President stopped off at Stonehenge on his return home from the Nato summit in Newport in September.

David Cameron visited Stonehenge today to highlight a tunnel passing Stonehenge, which is among dozens of new road schemes announced by the government 

Mr Cameron arrived at the Wiltshire site to welcome the £15bm investment into Britian's roads

Mr Cameron's visit came after Nick Clegg visited the World Heritage Site earlier this morning

Mr Clegg was first to arrive at Stonehenge – trumpeting the Government's announcement that the A303 close to the famous stones will be put into a tunnel, thus easing conditions at a notorious bottleneck.

The Prime Minister then arrived at the Wiltshire landmark claiming there was now an 'unstoppable momentum' behind the scheme.

He said: 'I think we are both delighted that it is going ahead because it's been the work of our Government to get the Government's finances under control.

'But frankly the more politicians that come here and say it's good that we are building the roads the country needs, frankly the happier I will be.'

Asked whether the project would go ahead even if there was a change of government in May, Mr Cameron said: 'It has unstoppable momentum now, because the plan for the tunnel is robust, the money in the national budget is there, the vital importance of infrastructure is now accepted by everybody. I think this is now unstoppable.'

The tunnel is part of a £2 billion scheme to dual the entire A303 and A358 to the South West. This will allow road users to drive on a dual carriageway from London to within 15 miles of Land's End.

But MPs tonight accused the the Tory and Lib Dem leaders of a cynical bid to drum up votes ahead of the next election.

Labour's Grahame Morris said: 'This is a blatant political stunt that would make US President Obama blush.

'The British public see through these stage managed photograph opportunities. The fact that Cameron and Clegg are going round the country attempting to cast themsleves as a cross between Braveheart and Swampy is laughable and faintly ridiculous.' 

Mr Obama visited the stones in his presidential helicopter Marine One, which flew to Boscombe Down Airbase, Wiltshire, before his motorcade drove to the ancient monument.

The president was then given a guided tour by curator Heather Sebire.

English Heritage, which manages the site, said it was 'an honour' to host the president.

General manager of Stonehenge, Kate Davies, said: 'His office told us the president was very interested to see the iconic monument for himself.

'Every day people from all over the world make the trip to the ancient stones but this visit was a particularly special one.'

Ms Sebire said Mr Obama 'was fascinated by the story of the stones, what we know about them and the mysteries that have yet to be solved'.

She went on: 'He described the atmosphere around the stones as 'really special' and his visit to Stonehenge as 'a highlight of my tour'.

Mr Obama described seeing the monument as 'cool' and said it was something he could tick off his 'bucket list'.
