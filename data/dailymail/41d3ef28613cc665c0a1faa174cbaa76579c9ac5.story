Defender Scott Dann admitted Alan Pardew's arrival at Crystal Palace was a huge boost as they claimed a 4-0 win over Dover in the FA Cup.

Pardew - finally announced as Neil Warnock's replacement on Saturday - was in the dugout at the Crabble and was able to preside over the comfortable victory against the Conference side.

Centre-half Dann tucked away two first-half goals to stave off any threat of a shock and Dwight Gayle added a third to put the result beyond doubt, before forgotten man Kevin Doyle added a late fourth.

'I'm delighted to get a couple of goals,' Dann told BT Sport 1.

'We knew it was a potential slip up here and we knew we had to be professional and we showed that today.

'The new manager coming in has given us a good boost and it was an opportunity for some of the lads to come in and show us what they've got.'

Dann hopes Palace will be able to match this result back in the Premier League.

He added: 'The manager has come from a top club and we're delighted to have him on board. Hopefully we can keep putting in performances like that in the Premier League.'
