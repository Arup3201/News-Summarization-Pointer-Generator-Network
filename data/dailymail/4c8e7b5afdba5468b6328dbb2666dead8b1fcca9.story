Jung Park, 41, allegedly placed ads in Korean newspapers seeking body paint models to work

A photographer  has been arrested on suspicion of trying to force women into having sex with him by threatening to have them deported if they refuse his advances.

Jung Park, 41, allegedly placed ads in Korean newspapers seeking body paint models to work for him at Simple Touch Entertainment in Los Angeles.

But police say they were approached by one model who said Park asked her to disrobe and pose for nude photos, then began to inappropriately touch her and tried to rape her.

When the woman refused his advances, Park told her that he would report her to Immigration and Naturalization Services, she told police.

Park was arrested on October 26 and later released after posting $100,000 bail.

But since then several more models have come forward and reported similar experiences with Park during photo shoots and interviews at his place of business.

Police said the advertisements the photographer used were listed in Korean newspapers, websites and radio stations, which were run by Simple Touch Entertainment.

Investigators now are asking for anyone who thinks they may have been a victim of Park to come forward and contact the police.

'I hope he gets what he deserves,' one woman who said she responded to Park's ads told CBS Los Angeles. 'Innocent women, trying to make a living, and taking advantage of them; that's not right.'
