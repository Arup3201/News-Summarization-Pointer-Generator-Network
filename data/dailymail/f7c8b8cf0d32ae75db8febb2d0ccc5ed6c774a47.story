Joe Allen has defended Brendan Rodgers amid the fierce criticism aimed at Liverpool's boss for fielding a weakened team against Real Madrid.

The Wales midfielder also thinks criticism of Rodgers' selection is 'disrespectful' to those who were picked to play in Madrid, including him.

Rodgers left seven first-choice stars out of his line-up at the Berneabeu despite the severe threat to Liverpool's hopes of progression into the Champions League group stages.

Asked if he felt criticism of the tactic was disrespectful, Allen told the Liverpool Echo: 'Yes I think it probably is.'

Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli were the three most high-profile names left out of the starting line-up in Madrid.

Rodgers suggested after the game that he had made the controversial selections to keep certain players fresh for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash against Chelsea at Anfield, and that is a concept Allen agrees with.

'You sometimes can’t win with a squad rotation policy but that is the only way to go,' he said. 'With the added demands we have this season, that has to be the way to do it. That is definitely going to get us results over the course of the season.

'The game plan in the summer was to recruit and get that bigger squad. We knew we had to deal with the demands of the Champions League as well as the Premier League, so now I think we have shown everyone the quality we have throughout.

'Everyone is genuinely competing for spots now and that is exactly what you need if you want to be successful. We had a lot of young players out there in Madrid and there’s no doubt they have gained massive experience from it.'
