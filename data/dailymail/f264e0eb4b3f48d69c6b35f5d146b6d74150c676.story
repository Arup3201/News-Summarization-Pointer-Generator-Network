A Dutch prince struck by an avalanche while skiing off-trail in Austria last week suffered massive brain damage and may never regain consciousness, doctors said today.

Johan Friso, 43, is the second son of the Netherlands' monarch Queen Beatrix.

Dr Wolfgang Koller, head of trauma at the Innsbruck hospital where Friso is being treated, said at a news conference broadcast live on Dutch national television that it took nearly 50 minutes to reanimate the prince after he was pulled from the snow.

He said: 'It is clear that the oxygen starvation has caused massive brain damage to the patient.

'At the moment, it cannot be predicted if he will ever regain consciousness.'

Friso,
who is married and has two young daughters, will be moved at a later 
date to a private rehabilitation clinic for further treatment.

But Dr Koller cautioned that it may take years before he awakens from his coma, if he ever does.

The
prince was skiing with one companion away from marked ski runs on February 17 when the
mass of snow, 30metres wide and 40 meters long

He 
was pulled unconscious from the drift about 20 minutes after the 
incident and resuscitated at the scene. He was then airlifted to the 
university clinic in Innsbruck.

His
condition was at first described as 'stable but life-threatening', and the queen and his wife
were at his side.

Stefan
Jochum, a spokesman for the 
Lech ski area where the accident occurred, last week said the incident 
took place as the prince and other skiers were on slopes away from
the marked Lech ski runs.

The trails were laden with snow after weeks of record 
falls.

Mr Jochum said: 'A snow slide came down and the 
prince was buried as the only member of the group.'

Members of the royal family were 
skiing in the mountain village of Lech, which had been hit by heavy 
snowfall in the run-up to last Friday.

The second of Beatrix's three sons, Friso gave up any claim to the 
Dutch throne in order to marry Dutch commoner Mabel Wisse Smit, in 2004. The pair have two daughters, Emma and Joanna.

He most recently worked 
as financial director at Urenco, the European uranium-enrichment 
consortium.

The crucial moment in his life as a member of the Dutch nobility came with his 2003 engagement to then-commoner Wisse Smit.

After the pair announced their intention to marry in 2003, Dutch media 
revealed that Wisse Smit's previous friendships included contacts while 
she was in college with a well-known figure in the Dutch underworld, a 
drug dealer who was later slain.

The couple publicly acknowledged having been 'naive and incomplete' 
during her vetting process before joining the royal family. Then-Prime 
Minister Jan Peter Balkenende signalled he could not recommend the 
marriage to parliament for approval.

They married anyway, a decision that meant Friso's removal from the line of succession.

The couple are still part of Beatrix's family and attend important royal
functions.

Mabel has been granted the title 'Princess Mabel' and Friso 
has an array of noble titles, including 'Prince of Oranje-Nassau' - but 
not 'Prince of the Netherlands'.
