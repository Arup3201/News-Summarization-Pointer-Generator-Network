Brazil head coach Dunga has labelled Chelsea midfielder Willian as one of the keys to his tactical revolution alongside Neymar as the Selecao prepare to face Chile at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

The five-time World Cup winners trained on the pitch of Arsenal's 60,000-capacity ground on Saturday ahead of the sell-out South American showdown in London on Sunday.

And with just over two months until the Copa America begins, Dunga - appointed head coach in the post-mortem of Brazil's embarassing World Cup elimination - sees Willian and Neymar as two of the key men in his tactical revolution.

Neither player started in the 7-1 humiliation against Germany in last year's semi-final, and Dunga wants the movement and mobility the pair share to help redefine the way Brazil play in the hope of bouncing back from their last tournament appearance.

'The movement and mobility of our players is key,' Dunga said. 'The more they play together the more things become automatic.

'Willian is skilled. He has a lot of pace, a speed in his reasoning and he can make the difference in many games. Neymar is doing very well and will only grow.'

'In regard to goals I don't think that will be a problem. But the record we really want him to get is Pele's number of World Cup wins.'

Both Neymar and Willian are set to be key men in Dunga's side for this summer's Copa America, where he has confirmed that no new players will be brought into his squad.

'Those who have never been called (for the squad) are not out, but they will have to wait for another opportunity,' he said.

'The Copa America is a competition, where we have to put players who already have an answer. The Copa America is not the place to test a player. I can't select someone I haven't worked with.'

Brazil have no new injury problems though Dunga said he will make changes to his side in London.

David Luiz and striker Diego Tardelli are both missing again but London fans will see plenty of familiar faces including Chelsea trio Oscar, Willian and Filipe Luis.

Brazil defender Gabriel Paulista could be up against his Arsenal team-mate Alexis Sanchez at their usual home.
