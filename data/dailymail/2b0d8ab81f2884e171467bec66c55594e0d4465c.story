Australian police discovered £99millon worth of crystal meth, which had been hidden in more than a dozen sea kayaks, at a Sydney warehouse.

Customs and Border Protection found approximately 400lbs (183kg) of methamphetamine which had been contained in a shipment of kayaks from China to Sydney, Australian Federal Police said.

Five people have been charged after 19 of the 27 kayaks shipped in a sealed container were found to contain drugs with an estimated street value of A$180million.

Big shipment: The £99milllion worth of drugs had been smuggled to Sydney from China

Taken in: Five people have been arrested since the bust earlier this month, and are due to appear in court on Wednesday

Busted: 400lbs (180kg) of methamphetamine was found in a container of sea kayaks at a warehouse in Sydney earlier this month

Police arranged the shipment to be delivered to a storage facility in Hillsdale, Sydney, where the substance returned a positive reading for methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth.

Four people - three men aged 35, 30 and 21, and one woman, aged 28 – all Taiwanese nationals, were taken into custody by Australian Federal police after they attempted to access the kayaks to retrieve the concealed substance.

Further investigations resulted in the arrest of 32-year-old man at his Kensington residence. It will be alleged in court that this man was involved in the facilitation of the container.

Australian Customs and Border Protection Service’s Regional Director NSW, Tim Fitzgerald, said the arrests are a combined effort by ACBPS and the AFP.

‘No matter the concealment, Customs and Border Protection has the technologies and systems to identify attempts to breach the border,’ Mr Fitzgerald said.

Big crime: The bust was a joint effort between the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and Australian Federal Police

‘By working with the Australian Federal Police, we have again stopped criminals seeking to damage our communities.’

AFP Manager Sydney Office Ray Johnson said this seizure is another example of collaborative efforts of law enforcement.

‘This
 is a great example of authorities working together to identify and 
disrupt criminals who are seeking to import drugs into Australia,’ 
Commander Johnson said.

‘The
 AFP and its partner agencies will continue to stop these harmful drugs 
from reaching our streets and affecting our neighbourhoods and 
communities.’

Charged: Three men and one woman of Taiwanese origin were arrested at the scene, and one Australian man was taken into custody at his home in Sydney

Discovery: An x-ray image shows the crystal meth packages as dark squares inside the kayaks

The AFP through its International Network is liaising with its law enforcement partners in China and Taiwan as part of ongoing investigations into this matter.

The 32 year-old Kensington man and the woman were each charged with one count of attempt to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, and the Taiwanese men were each charged with one count of possessing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug.

All five people were refused bail after appearing in Sydney Central Local Court on Wednesday, and will return to court in April.

The maximum penalty for these offences is life imprisonment.
