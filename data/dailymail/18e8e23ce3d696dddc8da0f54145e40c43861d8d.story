Passengers  waiting at a tram stop were given a shock - when a Nissan Micra pulled up to give them a lift instead.

The car ended up unexpectedly parked at Oldham King Street Metrolink stop, Oldham, after veering off the nearby road onto the tracks.  

Several passengers waiting at the stop tried to help to move the car, before police and firefighters arrived at the scene.

Wrong carriage: This Nissan Micra ended up on the tracks at Oldham King Street Metrolink stop, Oldham 

But the incident caused the next and final service from the stop to be cancelled. The incident also had a knock-on effect on overnight engineering works.

Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of drink-driving at the scene. He has been bailed until a later date.

A woman passenger was taken to hospital after the incident as a precaution, but police said that no-one had been injured. 

A photo of the car parked up on the tracks was soon posted by a witness on Facebook. 

Metrolink, which runs the service, said the control room received a call from a waiting passenger who had used the  emergency call point at the stop. 

The person reported that the car had been driven onto the inbound track, heading towards the city centre, at around 11.30pm.

A spokesman for tram operator Metrolink RATP Dev Limited said: 'The next and last service to travel that evening into the city centre from the Oldham King Street stop was held immediately at Oldham Central and any remaining passengers were asked to make alternative arrangements to their journey. 

'The police were notified immediately and arrived on site to remove the passengers from the car.'

A recovery vehicle removed the car at around 1am, after the incident on August 24. Engineers inspected the track for damage, but said it was superficial.

It's not the first time a car ended up on the wrong side of the tracks in the area. 

In March, trams between Eccles and Ashton-under-Lyne were delayed when a car ended up on tracks near the Holt Town stop on the Ashton line.

In January, tram bosses faced calls to improve signage after an elderly woman drove a high-powered Jaguar onto the tracks.

Witnesses said the 76-year-old continued down the line in Beswick for more than 200 yards.

The woman was not hurt but trams on the line between Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester were halted for more than an hour.

It was revealed last June how gran Marie Smith drove her Nissan Qashqai 200 yards up the line at the same spot and was also rescued. She blamed a lack of clear signs on Ashton New Road for the confusion.

And last October, a gold Citroen was driven onto the tracks outside a new Ashton-under-Lyne stop opposite Ikea just one week before its official opening.

Some of the lines are mostly street-running which has caused confusion for some drivers.
