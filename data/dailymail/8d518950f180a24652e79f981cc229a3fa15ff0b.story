A Ukrainian airforce pilot who has been on hunger strike in a Russian jail for 81 days could starve to death 'within days', a top official has warned as the prison service moved to assure the public her health is 'stable'.

Yelena Masyuk gave the stark assessment of helicopter navigator Nadia Savchenko's health after visiting the jailed pilot last week.

Savchenko, 33, has been on hunger strike for almost three months, has recently started to decline the glucose injections which have been keeping her alive.

Starving: Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko is said to be on the brink of death after going on hunger strike

Release: Campaigners are calling on the government to move her out of prison while she awaits trial 

But the Russian prison service has since said it is keeping a close watch on the Ukrainian - and has promised she will be moved to hospital as soon as there are 'serious complications'.

Savchenko, who is also a member of the Ukraine parliament, has been refusing food since December 13 in protest against her imprisonment.

She has been charged with involvement in the deaths of two Russian reporters in a mortar attack in east Ukraine - charges she strongly denies.

Instead, she claims the she was kidnapped and brought to Russia.

Late last week, Masyuk, a member of the Kremlin's rights council, published an impassioned plea for her release on humanitarian grounds.

According to the Moscow Times, Masyuk warned: 'Serious problems with her internal organs are beginning. Nadezhda Savchenko could die within days.'

She appealed for Savchenko to be moved to the Ukrainian Embassy, or, failing that, a flat in Moscow.

Charges: Russia alleges she was involved in the deaths of two reporters, killed in mortar explosions in fighting in the eastern Ukraine. Pictured: Ukrainian women walk past a wrecked armored personnel carrier

Casualties: But Shavchenko denies all charges and claims she was kidnapped by the Russian government - which is said to back separatists fighting for indepedence in her home country

However, the prison service has apparently taken not of her warning - and has claimed the pilot's condition is not as serious as first claimed.

Anatoly Rudy, the first deputy chief of the prison service, insisted her condition was stable - but if that were to change, they were prepared to move her to a civilian hospital.

Speaking to Russian reporters on Tuesday, he said: 'As soon as we see that there are serious complications we will request that civilian medical institutions take her and treat her.'

Putin is also coming under pressure from the international community to release Savchenko.

It is understood Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French leader Francois Hollande urged the pilot's release in a phone call late on Monday.

Earlier that same day, Poroshenko bestowed on Savchenko the country's highest honour, Hero of Ukraine, saying she was a 'symbol of the invincibility of the Ukrainian spirit and heroism'.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Savchenko, referring all inquiries to the Investigative Committee.

The committee, which reports directly to Putin, has previously said there was no reason to lift Savchenko's detention since it had 'indisputable proof' of her guilt, adding that 'it is for a court... to decide the degree of her guilt and punishment'.

It added: 'Unlike some politicians and so-called attorneys, we are guided by facts and not emotions or political tastes.' 

They claim she was involved in the deaths of two Russian reporters Igor Kornelyuk and Anton 
Voloshin, from state television channel Rossiya.

The pair were killed on June 18 
after being hit with shrapnel during an attack by Ukrainian forces near 
the city of Lugansk. 

Savchenko denies the charges.
