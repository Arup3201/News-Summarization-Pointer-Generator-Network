This is the extraordinary arsenal of weapons belonging to gunman Alois Huber who shot dead three policemen and a paramedic in Grosspriel, Austria on Tuesday.

In these startling images, the 55-year-old poacher's dedicated gun room can be seen in full - stacked from floor to ceiling with hundreds of shotguns.

Other shooting paraphernalia, such as shotgun cartridges, can also be seen scattered all over the floor of the room in his remote farmhouse.

Hoard: Alois Huber's arsenal of weapons, discovered by police in a room of his remote farmhouse

Disturbing: A large pile of deer skulls can be seen in one of Huber's rooms. Police say the poacher would kill the animals and take their heads back as a trophy

In another disturbing find, the Lower Austria Police Department discovered a room of 'hunting trophies' - namely the skulls of deer and other game he killed while poaching at night.

An enormous mound of skinless deer heads, still with their antlers attached, can be seen in another of Huber's rooms.

It is thought that Huber shot and killed the animals before he sawed off their heads and took them back to his house.

He then left their decapitated carcasses rotting under bushes in the nearby woods, police have said.

In Austria it is illegal to hunt wild animals for the 'trophy' of their heads.

Poaching is severely punished and offenders can get up to three years in prison.

Hunters are licensed only after passing exams that test their knowledge of weapons, ballistics, hunting traditions, different kinds of game and their diseases - and a host of other disciplines.

Police suspected Huber of illegal hunting and confronted him on Tuesday morning, pulling him over in his car while he was driving near to his home.

The gunman then fled in his car, before shooting dead a member of Austria's 
Cobra SWAT team at a police checkpoint.

An
 ambulance raced to the scene, but the gunman shot and killed its driver
 as he tried to give first aid to the dying policeman, police have said.

The attacker then fatally shot another police officer at a roadblock before barricading himself in the farm building.

Later on Tuesday, another officer who 
had been missing was found dead in his patrol car near the farm.

The officer was killed 
after the suspect carjacked the police vehicle and took him hostage.

The three police officers allegedly killed by Huber have been named as Johann Ecker, 51, Manfred Daurer, 44, and Roman Baumgartner, 38. Paramedic Johann Dorfwirth was also killed.

Following the shootings, Huber barricaded himself in a farm building near Melk, about 40 miles west of Vienna.

Around 100 armed
 police commandos and several army tanks surrounded the farmhouse before SWAT 
teams stormed the building.

Police found a charred body after pushing through a wall into a smoke-filled 
hidden basement on the farm grounds.

Regional
 police spokesman Roland Scherscher told reporters SWAT teams discovered
 the body after extinguishing a fire in a small cellar that was 
accessible only through a hidden door.

He
 said the corpse was so badly burned that it was impossible to identify.

However, police assumed it was that of the gunman - who had been holed up 
on the farm grounds more than 24 hours before the charred remains were 
found.

Schercher added that police 'had to 
push against the wall to enter the room' and that because 'the 
perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner,' the search took 
more than four hours.

Police
 said final identification and cause of death would have to wait until 
forensic experts had finished their work.

They said the assumption was 
that the suspect had laid the fire.

Austrian tabloid Krone  quoted a friend of 
the suspect who said he confessed to the shoot-out in a telephone call from his home
 as a police helicopter circled overhead and officers closed in.

The suspect allegedly said: 'Unfortunately
 it is true. I shot three policemen tonight.

'I am the Annaberg poacher. They 
shot me too, in the stomach. But it doesn't matter.

'I shot Burgi (his German shepherd dog) and they are not going to get me either.'

The newspaper quoted the friend as saying the suspected gunman had confided two weeks ago that he was schizophrenic.

Police
 said he fired the last shot about an hour before helmeted officers 
wearing body armor and toting assault rifles piled into three Austrian 
army tanks and moved in.

State Prosecutor Michaela Schnell says Huber is suspected in the illegal killing of numerous stags since 2005 and is also thought to have been the masked man who attacked a hunter with a knife two years ago, in what investigators now consider attempted murder.

However those in the Grosspriel or the cluster of surrounding hamlets dispute the claim.

They describe the 55-year-old as an expert who hunted legally and whose hobby turned into an obsession after his wife died about 15 years ago, leaving the childless widower with no close family.

Those willing to talk about him after the trauma left by his rampage still don't believe that he was the man leaving the headless carcasses of deer in his wake.

Innkeeper Martin Jaeger said: 'We often went hunting for rabbits and pheasant. There was never any talk of poaching.'

The provincial government of Lower Austria ordered black flags flown from all public buildings in honor of the victims.
