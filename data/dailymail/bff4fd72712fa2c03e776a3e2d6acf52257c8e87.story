Two more women accused Bill Cosby
Thursday of drugging them decades ago when they met him as
young models, and one said he sexually assaulted her, as more of
his performances were canceled.

More than a dozen women have publicly accused Cosby of
sexual misconduct in recent months, in a controversy that has
tarnished the image of the actor and comedian best known as the
lovable father figure on the 1980s sitcom The Cosby Show.

Cosby denies the allegations of sexual assault, many of which are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases.

Linda Brown and Lise-Lotte Lublin came forward Thursday
as the latest women to bring public accusations against Cosby at
the Los Angeles office of attorney Gloria Allred, who
acknowledged it was too late for them to sue Cosby.

Brown told reporters she met Cosby in 1969 in Canada and
went to his hotel suite where he gave her a soft drink that
caused her to black out. She said that when she woke up, she was
naked next to him in bed.

'I couldn't move or speak. I felt paralyzed, he flipped me
over and sexually assaulted me,' Brown said. 'I felt like a rag
doll and like a real-life blow-up doll for him.'

Lublin said she met Cosby in 1989 at a hotel in Las Vegas
and that he asked her to perform an improvisation on the pretext
of evaluating her acting. The comedian gave her two alcoholic
drinks that caused her to feel disoriented, she said.

Lublin said that a short time later, he embraced her. She
said her memory of the incident was hazy and that she remembered
waking up at her home in the area and not knowing how she got
there.

Allred said Brown and Lublin believed Cosby drugged them,
which other women in media interviews have also said happened to
them in encounters with the comedian.

In an emotional press conference held Thursday, Linda Brown recounted how in 1969, when she was 21 years old, her modelling agency set her up with Cosby on a dinner date while he was performing in Toronto, reported the New York Daily News.

The one-time cover girl is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial.

Brown recalled that Cosby showed her pictures of his family over dinner, and then offered to give her a ride home in his limousine.

On the way home, the comic allegedly told her he needed to stop by his hotel to pick up a present for someone, and he invited her up to his suite.

According to Brown, Cosby handed her a beverage and left the room to make a phone call.

'I took a sip and blacked out,' the woman recalled, adding that when she awakened, she inexplicably found herself lying naked under the covers beside Cosby.

She said she left the room feeling 'dirty, ashamed and embarrassed.'

Lisa-Lotte Lublin described a similar experience involving Bill Cosby, which allegedly occurred in Las Vegas in 1989, when she was 23 years old.

According to the ex-model, she and Cosby were in his Elvis Suite at the Hilton Hotel when he offered her two drinks and proceeded to pet her hair.

A short time later she passed out, but she remembered the color of the walls in the room and a flood of bright light.

Gloria Allred, who represents the two women, along with seven other Cosby accusers, said Brown and Lublin have decided to come forward years later because they were concerned for their reputations and afraid to take on the wealthy and powerful comedian.

Allred reminded reporters that while it was too late to hold Cosby accountable for Lublin's alleged assault, he could still face criminal prosecution in Canada, where there is no statute of limitations.

The high-profile attorney also revealed that she knows more women who may be willing to come forward with accusations against him in the future. 

Under fire: Cosby, 77, had a show scheduled for Thursday in Bakersfield, California, and another in Pittsburgh February 21, but both have been scrapped  

Cosby's lawyer has called those and similar claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' His attorney did not immediately
return emails Thursday.

Cosby, 77, had a show scheduled for Thursday in Bakersfield,
California, but in a statement earlier this week, he postponed
it.  

A message posted to the website of The Fox Theater states the Thursday night show has been postponed and the venue does not have a new date for the performance.

The theater did not provide a reason and says it will provide refunds to ticketholders. 

His February 21 show at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh was also
canceled by what venue officials described as the result of a
mutual agreement with Cosby. 

Heinz Hall issued a short news release Tuesday saying the show 'has been canceled by mutual agreement with Cosby's presenter and Heinz Hall management.' No specific reason was given.

The venue's website indicated that fewer than half the available tickets had been sold for the show at the 2,676-seat venue. Refunds will be issued for tickets to the Pittsburgh show.
