It was a day after his high school graduation in June 1987 when then-budding photographer Michael Galinsky picked up his camera and traveled to downtown Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to photograph a Ku Klux Klan rally.

Galinsky, who went on to become a prominent documentarian and photographer, recently stumbled upon a cache of his black-and-white photos showing men and women wearing robes emblazoned with crosses  and KKK insignia, and angry protesters urging them to get out.

Galinsky, who runs the Brooklyn-based Rumur multimedia studio, decided to dust off his old prints and release them online on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision that put an end to school segregation in the U.S.

Long-forgotten march: A day after Michael Galinsky graduate high school in 1987, he went to downtown Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to photograph a KKK parade

Dark knights: some 40 Klensmen in point white hats and robes embalazoned with insignia descended on Chapel Hill June 15, 1987

Blast from the past: Galinsky, who went on to a successful career as a filmmaker and photographer came up a box of negatives from the 1987 event just days before the 60th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision

Face-off: the sight of men and women dressed in Klan robes and carrying Confederate flags sparked rage in bystanders

In Galinsky's stark photos, 
participants of the march are seen walking down the street in Chapel 
Hill in cone-shaped hats and waving Confederate flags.

In
 a blog post on Rumur’s website Friday, Galinsky wrote that he has not 
thought of the KKK event for nearly 30 years, but looking at the 
negatives served a vivid reminder of that long-forgotten day.

The Associated Press reported at the time that the some 40 Klansmen took part in the demonstration held June 15, 1987 in Chapel Hill.

Some of the marchers came to the event armed with rifles and knives, landing them in jail on weapons charges. 

Members
 of the notorious white supremacy group were met by about 2,000 
protesters who lined the parade route and heckled them, holding signs 
calling the marchers ‘racist pigs’ and telling them to go home.

The
 son of civil rights activists from the North East, Galinsky wrote that 
he was not acutely aware of race or racism growing up in Chapel Hill in 
the decades after the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling.

Backlash: Some 2,000 residents welcomed members of the KKK with angry signs telling them to get out

Armed and dangerous: Some of the marchers came to the event armed with rifles and knives, landing them in jail on weapons charges

Strong impression: Seeing a noose hanging in a car on the parade route left Galinsky shocked and nervous

Deep-seated bigotry: The rally took place more than 30 years after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling ending segregation in American schools

‘I wasn’t aware that the Klan even still existed until they decided to 
march in Chapel Hill the day after my high school graduation in 1987,’ 
Galinsky stated in his post.

Looking
 back on that day, Galinsky recalled that seeing a noose hanging inside a
 car served as a reality check for him, leaving the newly minted 
high school graduate feeling shocked and nervous for his own safety.

The
 plan put forward by local religious leaders was for the Klensmen to 
march down an empty street because it was believed that actively 
protesting the event would give the hate group credence.

But hundreds of people came out anyway armed with placards to show their opposition to the KKK's intolerant ideology.

Galinsky explained that he was there because it was the first newsworthy event for him to photograph.

Failed plan: Local religious leaders encouraged residents to stay away from the march so as not to give the Klensmen any credence, but many people came out to protest against them

Sheltered childhood: Galinsky, the son of civil rights activists, admitted that he was not acutely aware of racism until he entered junior high school

Unpleasant surprise: The filmmaker recently moved back to Chapel Hill and was surprised by how entrenched social segregation remained in the college town

The filmmaker added that having recently moved back to Chapel Hill from Brooklyn, he was taken aback by how entrenched social segregation remained in the college town of 57,000.

‘We can all look back and be proud of what we have achieved in terms of limiting overt discrimination,' he wrote. ‘However, if we look around and see that there is a lot of work to be done to bring true equality and justice to our country…. Let’s let this day be a reminder that we still have a long way to go.‘
