Somebody might be in a little trouble on the home-front.

President Barack Obama took a break from sorting out the shutdown of the federal government on Monday to make sandwiches for low-income and homeless families.

Nobody would argue that feeding the homeless is a noble cause. However, the president's wife might not be too thrilled with what was on the menu.

Sticky situation: President Obama makes PB&Js for homeless children. His wife probably won't be too thrilled

Somebody might have some explaining to do as President Obama made PB&Js for homeless people on Monday, which doesn't jibe with his wife's health initiative

Processed: In addition to the PB&Js, Obama packaged up sandwiches made with processed meat - another no-no, if you ask his wife

Dozens of photos were taken showing Obama smearing peanut butter and 'sticky' jelly on what appears to be processed, white bread. Menu option number two appeared to be stacks of processed meat, also on white bread.

This doesn't exactly jibe with Michelle Obama's primary initiative as first lady: healthy eating.

Mrs. Obama started the 'Let's Move' movement, a program billed as 'America's move to raise a healthier generation of kids.'

The first lady has been very vocal - at times even demanding - in her crusade to slim down America's youth.

Nailed it: At one point, the president asked for pointers on how to seal a Ziplock bag

Hungry: Martha's Table is a D.C.-based non-profit that provides meals to homeless and low-income families

'In total, we are now eating 31 percent more calories than we were forty 
years agoâ€“including 56 percent more fats and oils and 14 percent more 
sugars and sweeteners. The average American now eats fifteen more pounds
of sugar a year than in 1970,' Mrs. Obama's organization explains on its website.

Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have roughly 350 calories per sandwich, depending on the amount of peanut butter and jelly added to the sandwich, according to an online calorie counter.

Additionally, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 122 fat calories and 46 grams of carbohydrates, which primarily is found in the bread.

To promote her initiative, Mrs. Obama even has written a book about the White House garden entitled 'American Grown.'

Crusade: Mrs. Obama's crusade to slim down America's youth has even prompted a book about the White House garden

Diet: According to the first lady, The physical and emotional health of an entire generation and the economic health and security of our nation is at stake

Change: According to Let's Move, The average American now eats fifteen more pounds of sugar a year than in 1970

The book includes gardening tips, recipes and even instructions on how to build your own compost bin.

While making the sugary sandwiches at Martha's Table, a D.C. nonprofit that helps low-income and homeless families, the president even joked about how sticky the gooey peanut spread and jelly were.

'Can I just say just in the few moments I've been here I'm feeling a 
little sticky,' Obama joked. 'I think I got some PBJ on my fingers.'

The situation might get even stickier when the president gets home and has to tell his wife that he's been wrist-deep in peanut butter and jelly all day.
