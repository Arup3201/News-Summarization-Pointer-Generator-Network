It’s now a smart, modern home that any family would be happy to call their own.

So it’s hard to believe that just over a year ago the property was bought for only £1 as part of a radical regeneration project.

Taxi driver Jayalal Madde was the first to buy one of 20 run-down terrace houses offered for sale for a pound by the council in an effort to revitalise a Liverpool neighbourhood blighted by boarded-up homes.

Jayalal Madde bought the four-bedroom property for £1 last year and hopes to move in with his wife Chaminda, 48, and two daughters before Christmas

To deter speculators and landlords, they were sold on condition that the purchaser was a local first-time buyer and had a job, would spend tens of thousands of pounds on refurbishing it, and promised to live there for at least five years.

Now Mr Madde has become the first person to finish the rebuilding work, and he and his family are hoping to move in before Christmas.

Spared mortgage repayments, they have been able to plough more than £30,000 into transforming the four-bedroom Toxteth house, including a stylish, modern kitchen with giant American-style fridge and a designer bathroom.

Mr Madde, 49, said yesterday: ‘I love the house because it’s a big, double-fronted terrace. I’m trying to move in before Christmas. There’s work still to do but I hope it won’t take long.’

He converted the home from two flats and installed new wiring, plumbing, windows and flooring

He said that once the other homes in the area were done up, it would be a ‘brand-new, regenerated community’.

‘I have spent less than £40,000 plus one pound and we have this amazing family home. The girls can’t wait to move in,’ he told Liverpool Confidential website.

‘Around the corner some smaller two-bedroomed homes were renovated and sold for just under £100,000. On that basis our house will be worth at least £150,000.’

The taxi driver spent around £35,000 on renovating the home and now believes it is worth £150,000

The property had been empty for 20 years and it had been on the council's list to be demolished for 15 years

The property had been empty for around 20 years, having previously been converted into flats before the residents left and nobody wanted to move in.

After becoming one of the lucky applicants among 1,000 would-be buyers, Mr Madde, who moved to Liverpool from his native Sri Lanka eight years ago, had said: ‘It has always been our dream to own our own home. 

'I’ve been saving up for years, and trying to get loans and a mortgage.’

The home was bought last year under a Liverpool council scheme to sell off 20 derelict properties

Refurbishment work began in May, and while flooring and furniture still need to be moved in, all the necessary structural changes are now complete. 

Mr Madde is currently living in rented accommodation nearby with his wife and their daughters Sansali, 13, and Simali, 11.

Liverpool council’s remaining £1 homes have all now found buyers and renovation work will begin in the coming months. 

The taxi driver put down new wooden flooring and built storage units in all four bedrooms 

In total 200 derelict properties in the Granby, Picton and Arnside Road areas of Liverpool are being brought back into use

During a guided tour, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said: ‘I am really pleased to be having a look round Mr Madde’s new home and seeing the work he has carried out to bring it up to standard. 

'I know from my conversations with him that he has a genuine commitment to the area and it is great to know that a once-run-down property has been lovingly transformed into a home for his family.’ 

In total nearly 200 derelict properties in the city are being brought back into use under a huge regeneration scheme.

The Mayor said the pound scheme is the first of its kind in the country and is being copied by other towns

The home now boasts two bathrooms, a cellar, four bedrooms and three downstairs living rooms
