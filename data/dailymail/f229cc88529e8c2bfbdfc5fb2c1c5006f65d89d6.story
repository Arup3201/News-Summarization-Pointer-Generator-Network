Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse were at the centre of a spitting storm as Manchester United grabbed a last-gasp victory at Newcastle - and the pair could now be banned for six games each. 

Ashley Young’s 89th-minute winner stole three points for Louis Van Gaal’s men following a gaffe from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul, but it was a clash between United defender Evans and his rival Cisse that produced the main talking point of the night.

The pair tangled during the first half at St James’ Park and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury.

The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. 

Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. 

However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games.  

As Cisse climbed to his feet, TV footage appeared to show Evans spitting down on the floor in the direction of his opponent.

Cisse reacted by putting his head towards Evans and seemed to spit back at him, although it is not clear if it landed on the Northern Ireland international.

The referee missed the incident meaning the FA, who are waiting for Anthony Taylor's report, can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each. 

Last season Hull City striker George Boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. 

However, the FA upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new FIFA guidelines, which state that any player 'dismissed from the Field of Play for spitting at an opponent or any other person' will be suspended 'following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his Club has completed its next six matches in approved Competitions.'

If found guilty, Cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman. 

Afterwards, Van Gaal defended Evans. ‘I did not see that (incident) from the bench, but I cannot imagine he would do that,’ said the Dutchman.

Newcastle head coach John Carver said: ‘You can't do it can you? It's one of the worst things in football. But I can't comment on it, I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and I need to have a look at it.’

Neither player was booked at the time by referee Anthony Taylor, who awarded a free-kick to Newcastle for the original tangle, but if the official missed the spitting incident the pair could face retrospective action from the FA.

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, covering the match as a pundit for BT Sport, slammed Cisse while suggesting Evans wasn’t a guilty party.

‘I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. I know Jonny, he’s not that type of person,’ he said.

‘If he wants to do that then it’s not hard to miss, is it? He’s only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.’

Scholes’ colleague, ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid star Steve McManaman, said: ‘I’d like to think he (Evans) is spitting at the floor and not at Cisse. But then Papiss Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans’ neck from about six inches. It’s absolutely disgusting.’

Van Gaal, meanwhile, was relieved to see Young steal three points on a night when all of the top four won.

‘I was very pleased with the win, especially here,’ he said.

‘I lost here as a coach of Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar. I knew it was difficult and Ryan Giggs said there is a lot of pressure from the crowd. But we made the crowd quiet.

‘But we don’t reward ourselves (with goals). If you don’t reward yourselves you can get negative results and David de Gea had to make two fantastic saves.

‘It was important to win after you see all of the results of our competitors in our rat race.

‘Everyone is now full of confidence going into the FA Cup game with Arsenal.’

As for Carver, he was furious that Newcastle were denied an early penalty when Chris Smalling fouled Emmanuel Riviere.

‘It’s frustrating and I’m so disappointed for the guys,’ he said. ‘For 89 minutes we were outstanding but we don’t have world-class players like they do.

‘To concede like we did is disappointing but what is more disappointing is the blatant penalty in the first half which was not given. Anthony Taylor is a human-being and he’s missed it. That would have set us up nicely.’
