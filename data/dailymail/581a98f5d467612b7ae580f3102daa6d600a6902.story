Guilty: City Analyst David Reynolds was fined £3,000 for an attack that left a bouncer with a broken nose

A City analyst who broke a bouncer’s nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel after claiming he was related to the Queen was spared jail today.

Instead David Reynolds, 31, was fined more than £3,000 for his attack on Arza Daery during a row at the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, central London, last December following a three-hour drinking binge.

The financier launched into a barely comprehensible rant against staff then punched the bouncer after his credit card was declined, City of London Magistrates’ Court heard.

Reynolds, of Highbury in North London, had claimed staff had ‘grossly over-reacted’ and that he ‘absolutely did not’ hit the bouncer.

But he was convicted of assault after magistrates rejected his version of events.

Sentencing Reynolds, chair of the bench, Dr Pete Galloway said: ‘You will not have been the first and you will not be the last person to have been so fuelled by alcohol seven days before Christmas Day that you take a course of action that with hindsight you regret.

‘We have looked very closely at everything that has been said about you.

‘We know that you regret not walking away as would have been highly advisable.’

Dr Galloway said that they had considered all Reynolds' character references, his savings, expenses and his salary.

He ordered Reynolds to pay a fine of £1,500 and compensation to the victim of £1,000.

Reynolds must also pay £600 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

On hearing the ruling, Reynolds, dressed smartly in a blue suit and tie, said: 'Thank you very much, your Honour'.

Prosecutor Jonathan Swain said: ‘Mr Reynolds was very drunk and as a result, he was asked to leave by management.

‘He was escorted from the premises by Mr Daery.

‘While outside, there was an unprovoked assault by Mr Reynolds. He punched Mr Daery in the face.

‘There was no threat of violence by either individual and as a result, a struggle ensued.

‘He was held by two door staff until the police arrived’, Mr Swain added.

Giving evidence, Mr Daery said: ‘I was called to the bar and found two gentlemen who were unable to pay for their drinks.

‘I tried to communicate with them, but he [Reynolds] was not responding.

He added: 'I was a couple of feet away and Reynolds kept coming back and forth calling the doormen names and calling me a c*** - all kinds of swear words.

'He kept telling me I was going to regret it, calling me a c***. My hands were behind my back and then he hit me.

'It was a punch, he punched me in the face in my nose with a closed fist. It was hard enough to break my nose - I got several fractures.'

Cleuber Martins, the second bouncer, told the court Reynolds claimed royal descent.

‘The defendant was talking in French.

‘He was shouting some bad swear words, calling everyone a c***, claiming to be related to the Royal family, saying we were all going to lose our jobs.

‘He kept saying “you deserve it, you’re all c***s, I’m related to the Queen”.’

Reynolds has 21 days to pay the costs.
