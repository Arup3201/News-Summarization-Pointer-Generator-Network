Twin boys who were joined at the abdomen when they were born have finally gone home nearly a year after a complicated operation to separate them.

Following countless surgeries after they were detached 11 months ago, little Owen and Emmett Ezell were released from a Texas rehabilitation center on Thursday.

'Just imagining having two healthy happy babies home,' mother Jenni Ezell told NBC through tears. 'This is it. This is what ... it’s what we’ve been waiting for.'

When they were born in July last year, doctors were unsure if the boys, who shared intestines and a liver, would survive.

At just one-month-old, the twins underwent a risky nine-hour operation at Medical City Children’s Hospital to be separated.

The boys have undergone numerous procedures and nearly two months of rehab before doctors said they could leave the hospital. 

'You can never predict what can happen 
but these little guys are definitely survivors,' Dr Tom Renard, the lead
 separation surgeon, told ABC News. 

His thoughts were echoed by the 
twins' parents Jenni and David Ezell, who said they were 'full of love and hope' that their boys were coming home.

In their blog about the twins, the Ezells wrote of their excitement at the babies being allowed to leave.

Growing up: Despite undergoing a massive operation, the twins are curious and happy babies

Curious: The twins' mother says they like to play and wave at the nurses who have been caring for them

'This day, Thursday, June 12, 2014 will forever be a day remembered in our little family,' they wrote.

'We
 are overjoyed. Overwhelmed. Exhausted. Full of love and hope. Worried. 
Relieved. Enamored. And yet we are still missing two boys. Liam and 
Ethan are both in AR with family, but we will all be home soon.'

The family 
added that the twins' older brothers Ethan and Liam were also happy to have the babies home.

Although the Ezell's expressed anxiety about having their twins at home after months of specialized medical care, a nurse will live with them full-time.

The parents were also taught how to care for the twins, who are breathing on their own but are still receiving oxygen through tubes, NBC reported.

'We’ve still got milestones to meet, but we’re so much closer,' Jenni Ezell told NBC.

The twins' father, David Ezell, said the experience has brought their family closer.

'The truth is, the more we have each other, close to each other, especially bringing these boys home, the stronger this family is going to get,' he told NBC.
