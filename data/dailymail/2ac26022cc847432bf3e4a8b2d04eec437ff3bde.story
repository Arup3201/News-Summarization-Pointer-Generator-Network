In the dock: Tulisa Contostavlos arrives at Southwark Crown Court today, where she is accused of setting up a cocaine deal

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos appeared in court today accused of helping to fix a £860 cocaine deal.

The 25-year-old allegedly arranged the supply of drugs between 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood and her friend, Mike GLC - whose real name is Michael Coombs.

The alleged deal is said to have been set up at London's Dorchester Hotel on May 10 last year.

Contostavlos is accused of helping the reporter obtain 0.5oz (13.9g) of cocaine for £860.

The singer appeared at Southwark Crown Court this morning dressed in a black blazer, black jumper and black stiletto heels.

The pop star, who had her hair tied up in a bun, spoke only to confirm her name when she appeared in the dock alongside Coombs, 35.

Contostavlos was officially dropped as an X Factor mentor days before her arrest in June last year, with Sharon Osbourne replacing her on the talent show.

She was brought to court by a Sun on Sunday newspaper investigation.

Coombs
 allegedly arranged to meet Mr Mahmood to supply 13.9 grams of cocaine at 
the Dorchester Hotel in central London but the meeting was covertly 
recorded and the defendants were arrested.

Contostavlos and Coombs, who sat in the dock flanked by a uniformed officer, are due to stand trial on July 14.

Judge Alistair McCreath released the 
pair on unconditional bail and ordered them to return to court on June 
25 for another preliminary hearing.

He said: 'You are both free to go. If you want to come on any further application you may do so.

'You must come on 25 June when I'll deal with pre-trial matters.

'You may both go on unconditional bail.'
