A coin commemorating Robin van Persie's stunning headed goal in Holland's 5-1 win over Spain in the World Cup has sold out within hours of going on sale.

The limited-edition souvenir, costing just under 10 euros, depicts the Manchester United striker's diving header during the opening group game last month.

Stunning: Van Persie scored one of the most memorable goals in World Cup history

The flip side: The commemorative coin sold out in hours despite 6,000 being produced

His superb piece of improvisation took Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas by surprise, after Daley Blind's cross-field ball.

Despite 6,000 being made, the coin is now completely sold out, with Dutch fans seemingly engulfed in World Cup fever as their side face Argentina in the semi-final on Wednesday evening.

The win, regarded as the most entertaining game of the World Cup so far, opened Louis van Gaal's last tournament as Dutch boss before joining Van Persie in Manchester to replace David Moyes.
