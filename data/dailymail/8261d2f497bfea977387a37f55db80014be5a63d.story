A Russian businessman machine-gunned in London was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family.

German Gorbuntsov’s business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year.

It is thought the 45-year-old financier, who was in hiding in London, feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies.

Coma: German Gorbuntsov was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination

Danger: There are now fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov, pictured, who flew to her husband's bedside in London

He said recently: ‘If I go back to 
Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed 
guard in hospital after being hit up to six times.

With
 the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the 
safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew 
to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son 
Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain.

Scotland
 Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the 
shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off
 by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening.

The
 banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City 
earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just 
stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The 
hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot.

Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf. Detectives leading the investigation revealed today that they had found a weapon, said by sources to be a pistol

A
 young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the 
mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services 
arrived.

The
 attack has been linked to the attempted murder of Mr Gorbuntsov’s 
former business partner Alexander Antonov who was shot in Moscow in 
2009.

Last night Mr 
Antonov, 61, claimed he and Mr Gorbuntsov were on ‘friendly’ terms in 
spite of an alleged £60million debt he owed to the victim.

Last
 month Mr Gorbuntsov accused two former business partners of being 
responsible for the attack, allegedly to settle the debt. At one point, 
the Russian authorities regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect.

But yesterday Mr Antonov said: ‘He was not a part of the assassination attempt.’

Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder, but police never identified the mastermind.

The
 same group were said to have forced Mr Gorbuntsov and his wife to sign 
over as much as £1.5billion. In 2010, Mr Gorbuntsov, fearing for his 
life, fled to London.

Yesterday
 his lawyer Vadim Vedenin said the banker had been planning to submit a 
political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim 
would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on 
allegations of embezzlement.

There
 was also a financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, 
whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million 
was not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank 
whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.
