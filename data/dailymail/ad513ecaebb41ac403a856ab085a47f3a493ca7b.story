Sarah Palin, the tea-party-darling former Alaska governor who ran for vice president in 2008, is leaving the door open for a presidential run in 2016, but mostly hawking a soon-to-premiere TV show.

As the final speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, Palin praised conservative leaders and trashed President Barack Obama, including a political smack-fest hidden in a Dr. Seuss-style children's rhyme.

'I do not like this, Uncle Sam. I do not like his health care scam,' she recited in a sing-song voice.

'I do not like these dirty crooks, or how they lie and cook the books. I do not like when Congress steals. I do not like their crony deals. I do not like this spying, man. I do not like "Oh, yes we can."'

The effort won her cheers of 'Run, Sarah, Run!' from some of the more than 1,000 activists who stayed at the CPAC event until the bitter end.

Anti affordable healthcare: Palin uses children's rhymes to get her points across to her audience

Palin was reprising an event from a 
quasi-filibuster staged last year by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, an 
extended-play effort to tie Obamacare's defunding to avoiding a partial 
government shutdown. At one point Cruz read 'Green Eggs and Ham' to his 
children over live television at their bedtime.

Palin
 fed red meat to her fans, insisting that 'Hope & Change,' and 'Yes 
We can' has become 'No You Can't' under President Obama.

'No you can't log on to the website, no you can't keep your health 
care, no you can't make a phone call without Michelle Obama knowing,' 
she jabbed.

In between 
snipes at the president's 'dopey wobbling on the world stage' and his 
pledge that he had al-Qaeda on the run – 'yea, possibly toward us,' she 
said – Palin carped about the White House's economic record and 
projected a GOP-led future recovery enabled by tea party insurgents.

'Their
 agenda is failure and fiasco on steroids,' she said of the Democratic 
Party. 'So America is counting on the GOP to get it right.'

'The age of Obama is almost over – the end of an error,' she said, to chuckles and hoots. 'He is the lamest of lame ducks.'

Palin said she would 'never say never' to running for president in 2016

The Sportsman Channel will launch a new Sarah Palin-hosted program in April, and is marketing her as the ultimate patriotic mass-communicator

Obama 'promised jobs for the jobless, but fewer people work today than when the peanut farmer was president,' she said, referring to President Jimmy Carter's 1970s economic malaise.

'He promised to heal the planet, stop the rise of the oceans,' Palin mocked. 'But the planet is not listening to "Dr. Obama."'

'The only thing rising in his la-la land is the Russian empire.'

'I'm probably being too hard on the president,' she sniped. 'After all, who could have seen this coming?'

Palin made headlines this week after Russian Vladimir Putin sent troops across the Ukrainian border into the Crimea region – a development she predicted in 2008 as a consequence of an Obama presidency, to a chorus of head-shaking from foreign-policy journalists.

Ted Cruz read from the children's classic 'Green Eggs And Ham' during his Senate filibuster in 2013 -- an event that Palin reprised with anti-Obama rhymes in place of Dr. Seuss' verses.

Palin is expected to deliver a crowd-pleasing red-meat speech to close the Conservative Political Action Conference

'I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So,' she gloated on Facebook,
 'but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as “an 
extremely far-fetched scenario” by the “high-brow” Foreign Policy 
magazine.

CPAC is an annual event that features speeches and glad-handing from potential Republican presidential candidates like Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who won the event's informal straw with a 31 per cent showing in a large field, easily besting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who placed second with 11 per cent.

On Friday night, Palin appeared on the Fox News Channel, fielding questions about whether she has presidential ambitions of her own following her loss two presidential elections ago as a vice presidential nominee.

'It depends on what it is that Americans really, really want in a candidate,' the politician-turned-media-gadfly told host Greta van Susteren.

'If
 they want a fighter, if they want someone who can so respect our 
exceptionalism, everything that makes America great, the promise of 
America. And if we don't find that, then I would run.'

'It doesn't have to be me,' Palin said.

'I do think that there are so many Americans who feel like I feel, and they're capable. They're willing and able to serve.'

Palin's star rose quickly in 2008 when GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain chose her as his running mate

Palin and McCain failed the electoral-college test by a wide margin but claimed popular vote victories (shown in red) in a vast majority of U.S. counties

Asked who her favorite presidential 
hopefuls are so far, she singled out Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky 
Sen. Rand Paul while adding that 'some would say we need to stay clear 
of those who have followed a conventional political path. Maybe they are
 part of the problem.'

But when van Susteren cornered Palin on her own White House ambitions, she said 'I'll never say never.'

'At
 this point in time,' she cautioned, 'I don't have a team of people, you
 know, getting out there doing these poll-tested – whatever they do – to
 let you know if you should run or not. I don't have any of that kind of
 organization going.'

NBC News correspondent Chuck Todd 
sniped at the idea of a Palin presidential run last month, saying on the
 air that if she ran it would be for 'a financial reason, to get back 
into the spotlight. Get the speaking fees back up.'

The Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. was awash with Palin paraphernalia

But
 right-wing activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference, 
held this week near the nation's capital, are eager to toss her back 
onto the political roulette wheel.

'Are
 you kidding?' attendee Kate Robinson told MailOnline. 'She may not ever
 get elected to anything else again, but at least she pushes the rest of
 the candidates to be more conservative – and not to shy away from the 
things that make us conservatives.'

Palin
 rose to national prominence when GOP presidential candidate Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona tapped her as his running mate in 2008. President 
Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden defeated the two handily, 
winning in a 365–173 electoral vote drubbing.

Four years later, she resigned her job as Alaska governor, citing the expense and distraction of fighting 'frivolous' ethics charges related to the firing of the state's public safety commissioner. Still, her statewide approval ratings never dipped below 53 per cent.

Palin's name is everywhere at the CPAC event, from giving the annual event's final speech to promoting the April premiere of her new show 'Amazing America' on the Sportsman Channel.

In another Fox News appearance in March, she slammed President Obama for what she said was a tepid response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimea region.

'People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,' Palin told host Sean Hannity. 'They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans.'
