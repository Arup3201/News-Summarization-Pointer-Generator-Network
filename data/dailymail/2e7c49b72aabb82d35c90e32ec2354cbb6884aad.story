A major US air show has canceled plans to stage a re-enactment of the World War II atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima following complaints that it was 'inappropriate.'

Dayton Air Show in Ohio has featured a re-enactment of the bombing of the Japanese city - in August 1945 - for more than 30 years.

Spokeswoman Brenda Kerfoot said a planned 'Great Wall of Fire' pyrotechnic show will still go ahead - but will not be used to represent the bombing after critics said it was inappropriate for a family event.

Ms Kerfoot said the show at Dayton International Airport in June, will not now feature a B-29 bomber - used 
to represent the Enola Gay which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

The B-29 plane 'Fifi,' will remain in the show but in a separate role, she said.

Air show officials said the re-enactment was meant to highlight an historic event that helped end the war and save lives that would have been lost if it had been prolonged.

'We've taken it as more of an educational show,' Ms Kerfoot said. 'The wording that we used probably wasn't the best.'

She said organisers did not want the Hiroshima aspect to 'become a distraction to the overall quality of the show.'

The
Dayton Daily News reported earlier that art curator Gabriela Pickett 
started an online petition to object to the 'glamorization of 
destruction.'

'I'm very pleased to hear that they 
are going to have two different events, and not the re-enacting,' she 
said. 'It would have been pretty much a celebration of dropping the bomb
that killed hundreds of thousands of people.'

She said some 200 people signed her 
online petition in a little more than a day, and that she had received a
number of emails from Japanese-Americans who were upset by the 
re-enactment.

She highlighted Dayton's immigrant-friendly 'Welcome Dayton' initiative. 'We are a city of peace,' she said.

The city has for years highlighted its role as the site of the Dayton peace accords on Bosnia negotiated in 1995. The Dayton Literary Peace Prize each year honors literature's power to promote peace.Â 

Ron Katsuyama, a University
of Dayton associate professor who was born in a US wartime detention 
camp for Japanese-Americans, said the show's contention that the bomb 
that killed so many Japanese ended up saving more lives is disputable.

He said some historians say Japan would have surrendered without the atomic bomb attacks.

'By
having shows like that, it is not only in bad taste, but I think I 
sustains misinformation,' said Prof Katsuyama, past president of the 
Asian American Council.

As
many as 140,000 people were killed by the atomic bomb attack on 
Hiroshima, with more than 70,000 more killed in an attack three days 
later on Nagasaki.

In
1994, Bill Clinton's White House pressured the US Postal Service into 
scrapping a mushroom cloud stamp planned to commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of the war's end, following protests by the Japanese 
government.

A
spokeswoman at the Japanese Embassy in Washington said yesterday that 
it was unaware of the air show issue and had no comment.

The
controversy is another setback for the show that dates to 1975 in the 
city that was home to the aviation-pioneering Wright Brothers.

The
air show last month announced that its headline act, the US Air Force's
Thunderbirds jet demonstration team, was canceled because of the cuts 
triggered by the failure to reach a federal budget deal in Washington.

The
show normally attracts more than 70,000 people for its displays of 
vintage planes, aerial acrobatics and stunts. Ms Kerfoot said attendance
likely will be lower this year.
