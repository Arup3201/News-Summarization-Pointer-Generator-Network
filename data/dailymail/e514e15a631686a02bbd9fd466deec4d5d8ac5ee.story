A six-year-old was found clinging to the dead body of her babysitter after the 59-year-old woman suffered a fatal heart attack while the pair were cooling off in a lake.

The distraught girl was rescued from the reservoir by boaters who found her holding on to the floating corpse of family friend Pamela Kaner.

No swimming or wading is allowed in Lake Gleneida, which is part of New York City's water supply system.

The girl told police that Ms Kaner brought her into the water late yesterday afternoon and was holding her before something went wrong.

An autopsy took place and reports suggested that Ms Kaner had suffered a heart attack.

A group of people in a rowboat heard the girl crying for help around 5pm and found her holding on to the woman's body, floating some distance from shore, Carmel Police Chief Michael Johnson said.

The lake is 730 yards across at its widest point - about 14 times the width of an American football field.

The boaters pulled the girl from the water and brought her to shore.

She was treated in hospital but was not seriously harmed. Kaner's body was retrieved by firefighters.

'I believe it was traumatic for the child,' Chief Johnson said.
