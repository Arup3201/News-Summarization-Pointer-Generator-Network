Victim: Ahtia Tabasim was killed along with her unborn child when Javad Malik's car hit her's as he tried to escape police during a high speed chase

A drug dealer has admitted killing a new bride and her unborn child when he smashed into her car during a high-speed police chase.

Javad Malik was trying to escape police in his Renault Megane which was full of class A and B drugs when he crashed into 28-year-old Ahtia Tabisim's Ford Fiesta in Birmingham in January.

Newlywed Ahtia, who was three months pregnant, suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital.

The crash happened just yards from her home.

Malik, 25, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, not being insured or having a licence and one count each of possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to supply at Birmingham Crown Court today.

He also pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis.

Judge William Davis QC warned Malik to expect a lengthy prison term.

He said: 'It hardly needs me to tell you the offences you have pleaded guilty to, singularly and cumulatively, are very serious and you will be bound to be sentenced to a very significant term of imprisonment.'

Mother-to-be Ahtia - known as Asha to friends and family - had wed husband Bahdar Zahman, 42, just five months before her death.

Although Ahtia, who worked with disabled people in a care home, was taken to hospital following the crash, she died from multiple injuries.

Speaking shortly after her death, her friends and family paid tribute to 'beautiful' Ahtia who 'spent her life caring for others.'

Her sister-in-law Nahila Mahmood, 24, said: 'We are absolutely shattered by her death.

'It’s just devastated us all more than words can convey.

'When she found out she was pregnant - she was over the moon. She wanted a little girl because she always said there were too many boys in her family.

'Badar is just a broken man, he is devastated.

'She loved her job and would work 12 hours a day no problem at all, we couldn’t believe how much she loved it.

She added: 'Ahtia worked with disabled and elderly people at a care home and if one of them died she would be devastated for weeks.

'She dedicated her life looking after others and making their lives better. The world has lost a special person.'

Her devastated father, Arshad Mahmood Hussain, said: 'She was very bright and friendly - a lovely girl who was loved by all who knew her.'

Ahtia's uncle Sajad Hussain added: 'Everyone is completely devastated, she was like a best friend to everyone.

'It's such a shock and very stressful, especially for her mother, she loved her daughter so much.

'She was a carer in an old persons' home and when they found out they were shocked. The patients and the staff loved her so much.'

Malik will be sentenced at a hearing in July.

The incident was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission by West Midlands Police following the incident but it was satisfied that there were no concerns over officers' actions.
