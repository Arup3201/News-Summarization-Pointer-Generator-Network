The 911 call made by disgraced football star Chad Johnson's wife shortly after she ran to her next door neighbor's house after her husband allegedly head butted her during an argument on Sunday.

The unidentified male neighbor is heard speaking in hushed tones as he explains the situation and urges emergency operators to send police to his home but to avoid alerting the press.

'I have somebody here at my house that was in a little domestic dispute with their husband and I think we need to have a police officer come over here and talk to her,' the neighbor says.

He says that the woman, who is Johnson's 36-year-old wife Evelyn Lozada, had a 'nice cut on her forehead' that came from Johnson when he 'hit her with his head'.

Released: NFL star Chad Johnson bonded out of jail 16 hours after being arrested for allegedly headbutting his new wife Evelyn Lozada, right, outside their home in Davie, Florida on Saturday night

'I think it was just a misunderstanding but we're worried that he's going to come and get upset,' the neighbor explains.

'I don't want the police to come with their lights on but I just want them to come until everybody calms down.'

The neighbor is heard whispering to Lozada and reporting her answers back to the emergency operator, saying that she believed Johnson was either in their house or driving around the neighborhood looking for her in his black matte Smart car.

The Miami Herald reports
that the police department released the tape Monday evening, a day 
after he was released on a bond and promptly kicked off the Miami 
Dolphins.

Johnson signed a one-year deal with 
the Miami Dolphins - worth just under $1million - in June to revive his 
career after he was released by the New England Patriots.but the Dolphins have now cut ties with the wide receiver, after team officials met with him following his release from jail.

The argument allegedly occurred outside the couple's Miami home after Lozada confronted him about a condom receipt she found in their car’s trunk.

The team announced via the team's website and Twitter late Sunday that they terminated Johnson's contract.

Charged: Johnson has been charged with battery and domestic violence. According to the police report, his wife fled to a neighbour's house fearing for her safety after Johnson attacked her

He was released from Broward County 
jail at 1pm on $2,500 bond after appearing in court earlier Sunday 
morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence.

Johnson's defense attorney, Adam Swickle, said a no-contact order has been issued that prevents Johnson from contacting Lozada.

Johnson
and his wife were at dinner when she confronted him about a receipt she
had found for a box of condoms, said Davie police Capt Dale Engle.

The argument got heated and continued on the drive home, he said.

When they arrived in their driveway in Davie, the 34-year-old Johnson head-butted Lozada, she told police.

According
to the police report, Johnson started screaming at his wife, yelling, 
‘I don’t give a f***! I don’t give a f*** about my career!’

Fearing for her safety, Lozada fled to a neighbour’s house and called 911 from there, the report says.

TMZ
posted the police report which says that Johnson then drove around the 
neighbour searching for his wife. However, Johnson told the officer that
he went for a drive to give Lozada time to calm down, according to the 
document.

The responding officer who filed the 
report said that Johnson admitted to having an argument but said that 
Lozada had head-butted him.

Lozada sustained a 3inch laceration on her head while Johnson suffered no injuries, the report states.

Lozada, who is on the reality show, ‘Basketball Wives,’ was treated at a hospital for a 3-inch cut to her forehead, Engle said.

Johnson,
who changed his last name back to Johnson from Ochocinco after his July
4 wedding to Lozada, was held Saturday night in Broward County Jail.

Johnson's lawyer, Adam Swickle, said in court today, 'Mr. Johnson has been a resident of the state of Florida for pretty much his entire life. He has no prior offenses, and essentially, we're asking for the court to set a standard bond.'

The state asked for a bond of $5,000 or more.

Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene originally said the team was 'aware of the situation' and were in the process of gathering of relevant information.'

Johnson's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, declined to comment.

Johnson signed with the Dolphins in 
June, four days after he was released by New England. A six-time Pro 
Bowl receiver with Cincinnati, he caught only 15 passes in 15 games for 
the Patriots last year after they acquired him in a trade for a pair of 
draft picks.

On Friday 
night in the Dolphins' 20-7 loss to Tampa Bay in the exhibition opener, 
Johnson let the only pass thrown to him slip through his hands.

Lovers' quarrel: The argument that ended in Johnson's arrest broke out when his wife, Evelyn Lozada, left, confronted him about finding a receipt for condoms

Johnson was known as Ochocinco for the past four seasons. He chose the name in honour of the No. 85 he wore on his jersey.

Johnson and Lozada were prominent in the recent first episode of HBO's 'Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins.'

As he walked out of the Dolphins' 
training facility on the first episode of the series documenting the 
team's training camp, Johnson jokingly yet prophetically, told team 
officials, ‘I'm going to get arrested this weekend.’

While still in college, Johnson was 
arrested in connection to a domestic dispute incident, but has since 
stayed out of trouble with the law – a fact he mentions in his 2007 
autobiography Ocho Cinco: What Football And Life Have Thrown My Way, 
according to the site SB Nation.

In a passage addressing an alleged 
altercation with an NFL employee, Johnson writes in part: ‘You see, the 
funniest part is that people think I’m so bad, but do you see one arrest
on me since I got to the NFL? Do you see me getting suspended for using
drugs or steroids? Do you see anything about me beating up my 
girlfriend or some other guys? No, none of that.’

VH1's ‘Basketball Wives’ is filmed in Miami and also features Shaunie O'Neal, the former wife of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal. Lozada used to be the fiancee of NBA player Antoine Walker.

Johnson and Lozada's lavish wedding at Le Chateau des Palmiers in St. Maarten is supposed to be part of another VH1 reality series that begins in September called, ‘Eve & Ocho,’ according to ESPN.
