Back to jail: Steven Powell, seen in an old mug shot, is serving 40 days in jail for failing to get treatment

Steven Powell, the father-in-law of missing mother Susan Powell, has been sent back to jail for refusing to get sexual deviancy treatment as he awaits child porn charges, it has emerged.

A Washington state judge ruled that the 64-year-old, who is from Tacoma, must go back to jail for at least 40 days, RadarOnline reported.

Saturday will mark five years since his daughter-in-law Susan vanished in Utah, which means she will be declared legally dead. Her husband, Josh Powell, was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged in the case.

Tragedy struck for a second time in 2012 when Josh Powell attacked the couple's two young sons with a hatchet and then burned down his Graham, Washington home, with him and the boys inside.

In 2012, authorities searched a home he had previously shared with his father, Steven Powell, and allegedly found that the elder Powell had child pornography in his possession.

In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom and was sentenced to serve two-and-a-half years in June 2012.

He got out of Washington State prison in March after finishing up his sentence. 

But last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial.

In court: Steven Powell, pictured in court in 2011, spent two years inside for taking explicit photos of two young girls who lived next door to him. He was released earlier this year but has headed back to jail again

On his release from prison, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation.

He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools.

In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, according to police reports.

In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report.

His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to three days in jail.

Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report.

His parole officer recently asked the judge to sentence him to another 60 days behind bars, saying that he poses a 'continued risk to the community' for failing to undergo the treatment.

On Saturday, it will be the five-year anniversary of Susan Powell's disappearance - which means she will be declared legally dead under Utah law.  

Josh, 36, is suspected to have killed his wife, although family members have voiced their belief that Steven was complicit in her presumed death.

Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant.

The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public, doing the laundry or sitting in her car, apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture.
