Italian nuclear scientist Bruno Pontecorvo suddenly fled to the USSR in 1950 while in the middle of a holiday with his family

For decades the mystery of why Italian nuclear physicist Bruno Pontecorvo defected from the Allies to the USSR has baffled Cold War historians.

The scientist, while on holiday in Italy with his wife and children in 1950, suddenly disappeared, resurfacing years later on the other side of the Iron Curtain.

But now a new book has revealed that Pontecorvo was being trailed by the FBI for suspected communist activity, and has claimed that he fled to Russia after being tipped off by none other than infamous double agent Kim Philby.

Pontecorvo, a prominent nuclear physicist in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, shocked the world when he defected to the USSR.

After re-emerging five years later in Moscow, he eventually said he left for ideological reasons - but the real reason why he fled remained shrouded in mystery for more than 60 years.

Frank Close, a scientist who believes that Pontecorvo could have gone on to win a Nobel prize had he stayed with the West, told the Observer that the FBI were investigating the Italian at the time of his disappearance. 

Mr Close obtained a previously classified letter from that shows the Americans suspected the scientist of having communist sympathies.

The letter, written shortly before Pontecorvo went on holiday to Italy, was sent from the British embassy in Washington to MI5.

It reads: 'The [FBI] now ask [for] any information which may be available to us which would indicate that Pontecorvo may be engaged in communist activities at the present time or [previously] during his residence in the United States.'

It also says that the Secret Intelligence Service in Washington had been unable to find previous communications on the subject, sent by the FBI in 1943. Its representative in the U.S. capital was Philby - who later defected to the Soviet Union along with fellow members of the Cambridge spy ring.

Mr Close believes that Philby would have known of the investigation and would have tipped off Russia, who would have immediately informed Pontecorvo and helped him escape. 

A new book claims that Pontecorvo escaped to Moscow after Kim Philby tipped off the Russians, who in turn tipped off the Italian physicist, that the scientist was being investigated by the FBI for communist activities

'One might imagine that the failure to find the [FBI] letters occurred because he had destroyed the evidence,' Mr Close said.

'It's 99.9 per cent certain that Philby would then have informed [the Russians].'

The letter appears in Mr Close's new book Half Life: The Divided Life of Bruno Pontecorvo.

The book also suggests that the Italian had been passing secrets about the U.S. atomic programme to the USSR.

The author interviewed Pontecorvo's son Gil, who is now 77, who recalled their sudden move to Moscow.

Mr Close said the family flew from Rome to Moscow via Stockholm and Helsinki. He added: 'In Helsinki, they were in two cars and his father was in the trunk of one car. [The son] said, in a huge understatement, "I knew something was up."'

Pontecorvo, became a British citizen in 1948 and was a member of the Atomic Energy Authority research station at Harwell, Berkshire.

Kim Philby was a high-ranking member of the British Intelligence who worked as a double agent before defecting to the USSR in 1963.

That year, he was revealed to be a member of the spy ring now known as the Cambridge Five, the other members of which were Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, and possibly, John Cairncross.

Of the five, Philby was regarded as the most successful in providing secret information to the Soviet Union.

Philby, who died in 1988, was misled by Moscow and believed he would be made a colonel in the KGB upon his arrival in Russia.

In fact, he did not see the KGB's headquarters for ten years and was given little real work, spending a significant period under virtual house arrest as Russian agents feared he would return to London
