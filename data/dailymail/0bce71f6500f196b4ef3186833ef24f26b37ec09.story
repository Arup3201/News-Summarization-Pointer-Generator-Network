A football player who won the Superbowl with the Baltimore Ravens escaped a child support lawsuit in the days before the championship game, it was reported today.

Ray Lewis was allegedly being sued by the mother of his child Sharnika Kelly. In a bitter legal battle which lasted more than two years, Ms Kelly wanted the sports star to pay more money for his 11-year-old son.

The lawsuit was dropped on February 1 in Florida - two days before the Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans.

It has not been made clear whether Ms Kelly dropped the case or the couple made an arrangement outside of a legal setting,Â TMZ reported.

Earlier reports suggested that Lewis was hesitant to pay out more money to the woman because she had financial problems.

Baltimore's 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers meant a second Super Bowl ring for veteran linebacker Lewis, 12 years after his first.

Lewis, who has since retired from the game, was the only current player to have started with the team when it came to the city from Cleveland in 1996.

He was star attraction at the Ravens victorious homecoming, telling the city of Baltimore: ' I love you for ever and ever and ever and ever.'
