A bungling burglar has been arrested after the homeowner posted surveillance footage on Facebook of the thief wandering around his home and a member of the public tipped off the police. 

Austin Jones, 23, appeared to be oblivious to security cameras on the front and inside of the home when he allegedly climbed through a rear window last Thursday.

The burglar was not wearing a mask when he entered the home in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Caught by the victim: The man whose house that 23-year-old Austin Jones is believed to have robbed posted a video of him online

When married father Ed Vidal came home to find his home had been robbed, he posted the surveillance footage on Facebook to get help from the public.

Mr Vidal wrote: 'Need a little help from my Vegas peeps, 
this guys broke into our house today the 29th of August at about 9am, in
the Spencer and Pebble area of Vegas.

'Fortunately he was too stupid to 
realize we have cameras in the house. Please take a moment to watch and 
if you can give us any information that would be awesome. Also please 
share if you can. We want to put this guy out on blast!'

On the footage, the thief can be seen driving up to the front of the home in a silver sedan and parking outside.

He walks straight past a security camera above the front door without wearing a mask.

Brazen: The thief strolled around the empty home before leaving with what appeared to be a water jug full of loose cash

He then clambers through a rear window and is caught on a surveillance camera in the living room.

After poking about in various rooms on the ground level, the thief appears to put on a rubber glove and go upstairs.

He returns with what looks like a plastic jug full of loose cash before using the family's own holdalls to remove a stash of belongings.

The burglar is then seen struggling to his car with a backpack and suitcase full of the family's possessions.

Members of the public contacted the police after viewing Mr Vidal's video clip. Jones turned himself in after being contacted by police on Saturday.

Jones has been charged with burglary and for violating a previous suspended sentence.

Making off: The burglar calmly returned to his car with the stolen property
