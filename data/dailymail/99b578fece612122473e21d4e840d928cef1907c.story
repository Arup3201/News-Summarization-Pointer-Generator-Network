Staff at South Lakes Wild Animal Park have been banned from climbing ladders to put food on poles

Zoo keepers have been banned from climbing ladders when putting food for their tigers on top of 20ft poles.

Putting the food on the poles allows the rare cats to climb and follow their hunting instincts, as well as entertaining thousands of visitors.

But Barrow Borough Council has decreed it is too dangerous and imposed the health and safety ruling on South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton, Cumbria.

It comes after a keeper was blown off her ladder this year in strong winds and suffered a broken collarbone.

The zoo said its staff, who are estimated to have fed the tigers this way about 75,000 times in the past 18 years, now wear helmets, while the ladders are strapped to the poles.

In a statement from the zoo posted on their Facebook page, it said: 'Even though the keepers now wear helmets, strap the ladders to the poles firmly and have permanent foot fixing points for the ladders, Barrow Borough Council wishes to stop us from feeding in this way as they claim it to be too dangerous for the staff.'

It added that the ban would completely stop the ‘exciting’ feeding time practice and ‘our unique way of stimulating our cats’.

Feeding the endangered Sumatran tigers this way was ‘a scientifically proven way’ of improving their health, fitness and welfare, the zoo said. 

The zoo said it had tried rope pulley systems and long poles to get the meat to the top of poles but it did not work.

'We have made every effort to find solutions that benefit the staff and the animals and yet we are still in this situation,' added the post.   

A Barrow Borough Council spokesperson said an improvement notice was served under section 21 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

'This notice was served because the park had failed to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of its employees to prevent a person falling a distance liable to cause personal injury whilst undertaking the routine placement of food at height for big cat carnivores,' added the spokesperson.

Barrow Borough Council has a duty to ensure the health and safety of persons employed at the park and also visitors to the park.'
