A pizza parlor customer who wrote a bad check in 2002 has written an apology letter and paid the bill after 13 years of feeling guilt - and they even included interest. 

The customer explained in the letter that they were 'going through a very difficult time financially' and had a 'hungry child to feed' when they wrote a check they knew would bounce. 

A money order for $54.39 was included with the letter to account for an 8 per cent compound interest on the $20 bill.

A pizza parlor customer who wrote a bad check in 2002 wrote an apology letter (pictured) and included a money order of $54.39 to pay the bill, with compound interest, after 13 years of feeling guilt 

The writer, who said they had worked hard and 'built up a solid business over the last decade', admitted they thought about the bad check often and were still 'incredibly ashamed and embarrassed at my behavior'.

'I have visited your store several times in the last few years and have always wanted to confess and ask you to forgive me,' they continue. 

'But I have not been able to summon up the courage, so I just eat my pizza and leave.'

The pizza parlor owner, identified only by the username 'morgan_freemun', posted the letter under the heading 'received this today, I'm speechless' on Reddit, where it has amassed more than 4,000 comments in one day.

He said he didn't remember the bounced check and felt 'bad for the poor guy'. 

The owner posted the letter under the heading 'received this today, I'm speechless' on Reddit, where a user advised him to hang up a sign on his pizza parlor so that the writer would find out he had been forgiven 

'I probably forgot about him when I wrote the check off as a loss and never gave him another thought. This poor dude has been dwelling on this for over a decade.' 

The owner called the letter a 'big showing of character' and said if he ever finds out who the anonymous writer is, he wanted to have a beer with them - drinks on him.

There was no return address or identifying information on the letter. 

After one Reddit user suggested the parlor put up a sign saying 'all is forgiven, letter received', the owner said he would get working on it right away.

'I really hope to find out who it is, but if not that's cool too,' he said. 'I don't want to embarrass the guy.' 

The owner said he opened his pizza shop 15 years ago and used to get bad checks all the time in the early 2000s, until he stopped accepting them in 2006. 

Some Reddit users were inspired by the letter and shared their own stories of helping people who were down on their luck. 

And one user told the owner the letter had added a 'real spring' to their step and that they 'liked being reminded that good people truly exist.'
