Norwich striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel has joined French side St Etienne on a season-long loan.

The 26-year-old Holland international endured a miserable debut campaign at Carrow Road after his club-record transfer from Sporting Lisbon, scoring just once in 27 appearances.

His future has been in doubt all summer having been heavily linked with a move away from Norfolk, with the Ligue 1 outfit now securing his services.

Farewell: The Holland international tweeted his reasons for leaving Norwich

City boss Neil Adams told the club's official website, www.canaries.co.uk: 'I can't speak highly enough about how professional Ricky has been even though he had a difficult first season at the club.

'His attitude has been first class and this move represents an opportunity for him to play regularly and get back to scoring goals in the way he has done in the past. We wish him the best of luck.'

Van Wolfswinkel has not played for Norwich since scoring twice in the 6-1 friendly win at Braintree, missing the club's pre-season tour of Italy after bruising his knee in training.

Norwich are also braced for a fresh bid from QPR for Leroy Fer with cash plus Karl Henry being offered. Southampton have also expressed an interest in the midfielder. 

Brace yourselves! Norwich are expecting another bid from QPR for midfielder Leroy Fer
