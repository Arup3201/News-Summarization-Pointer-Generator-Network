Fresh from scoring four goals in the Premier League, Sergio Aguero has announced he will be releasing his autobiography in English.

'My Story', released last year in Argentina with a foreword from Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi, goes through his career from the start.

From Independiente through to Atletico Madrid and Manchester City, the 26-year-old is slowly but surely becoming the world's top centre forward.

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero posted the picture on his Twitter page on Monday

Aguero struck FOUR goals for City against Tottenham on Saturday as the hosts cruised to a 4-1 victory

Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. 

Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games)

Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games)

Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games)

Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games)

Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) 

He has 85 goals in 132 appearances for City in just over three seasons, and has the best minutes per goal ratio in Premier League history.

Aguero tweeted on Monday: 'Excited to announce my book will soon be available in English! Here's a sneak peek of the cover! #AgueroMyStory.'

Aguero is preparing for Manchester City's behind-closed-doors game at CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Tuesday, having picked up just one point in their opening two games.

Aguero could have scored a first half hat-trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound
