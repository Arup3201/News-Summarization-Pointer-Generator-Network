Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has launched a robust defence of his tenure in South Wales and believes he has been portrayed unfairly as a villain.

Tan's time at the Cardiff City Stadium has been hounded by controversy with the owner changing the club's colours, much to the displeasure of the fans, and sacking promotion-winning manager Malky Mackay after rows over transfers.

The Malaysian businessman, however, insists that he retains the backing of the majority of Cardiff fans and believes he has been given a rough ride by the British press, who he branded 'a little bit racist'. 'Do you think that Malky Mackay would have got us promoted without my investment? Without me giving him money? After we got promoted the fans were all very supportive, everybody was appreciative,' he told BBC Sport.

'Overall, even now, I think, I would say even 90 per cent of the fans are supportive, the problem is you have 10 per cent or five per cent or maybe even a few hundred people that are not supportive, who are more vocal.

'And then you have the British press who have has been misled by some people, feeding them wrong information and saying what a terrible person I am and trying to make fun of me and paint me like a villain.

'But my experience is the majority are very supportive. I go to the club, many people come and shake my hand, want to shake hands with me, want my autograph, so generally I think it is not too bad.

'I will say that the British press is unfair and maybe they are unfair because because we didn't tell our side of the story that well.

Flop: Andreas Cornelius left the club in January

'And sometimes the British press (are) maybe a little bit racist and quite unfair.'

Tan claimed that his family want him to leave the troubled Premier League club, who are in the relegation zone, but added he will only quit if the fans 'p*** him off'.

'Some of my family members really want me to leave. They think it's not worth it. They think no-one is grateful, but you have to be patient, accept the criticism and sometimes the insults,' said Tan.

'Right now at this point of time, I will stay, unless the fans really p*** me off so much, then I will leave.'

Mackay was dismissed in December amid claims from Tan that he vastly overspent in the summer and chief executive Simon Lim recently released a statement criticising the £7.6million signing of striker Andreas Cornelius, who left the club in January after not scoring a goal. Cardiff made an £8.5m loss on the Dane, when wages and agents' fees are included.

Mackay has since been replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Tan is confident that the Norwegian can keep the club in the Premier League, despite them currently being three points adrift of safety.

'We overspend on the transfer. He was supposed to spend £35m which is what I agreed to put in. We bought the wrong striker who does not score any goals,' Tan said.

Out: Malky Mackay was sacked by Tan last year despite steering the club to the Barclays Premier League

'He (Mackay) didn't do very well at Watford, but somehow our CEO and our chairman hired him and replaced Dave Jones.

'Dave Jones actually did much better. So I think Malky got lucky when he came to Cardiff.'

He added: 'Although we're not doing very well now, we are in the relegation zone, I'm convinced and believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be able to keep us in the Premier League.'

Despite the criticism, Tan insists he is in it for the long haul at Cardiff and believes that eventually the fans who are against him will be made to eat their words.

'The club would have gone bust many times if I had not been around,' he said. 'I came to invest in the club and I just put in some money and I thought that's about it, actually I didn't know the club was in such bad shape.

'I made a decision and when I make a decision to do something I want to stick by it and see it through (to) the end and make it a success. And likewise the same for Cardiff.

'We were going through some difficulties, we had the wrong people doing things for us but I think we will get it right. 

'And I think when this thing is over, fans will understand and they should regret what they have done to me and maybe some of them should apologise to me.'

In the spotlight: Tan has defended his decision to wear sunglasses and leather gloves at Cardiff games

Tan, who is well known for wearing his Cardiff strip over his shirt and tie, while sporting leather gloves and sunglasses, also insisted he will not revert the club's colours back to their traditional blue.

'There is no way I will change it back to blue under my ownership,' he said.

'Perhaps they can find an owner who likes blue and buy me out. Sure, he can change it to blue after that. I'll go somewhere and do another red club.

'I wear sunglasses because of the glare of the spotlights. I wear gloves because it is very cold in the UK. Frankly, sometimes I think they are nuts making all these comments.'
