The Nevada desert is normally associated with enormous casinos and lavish hotels.

But it could soon become a focal point of the motoring industry - as Tesla's $5billion Gigafactory takes shape.

The huge project is part of co-founder and CEO Elon Musk's plans to drive down the cost of electric cars.

In September, the South-African born entrepreneur announced that the site near Reno, Nevada, was the chosen location for the lithium-ion battery plant, which is expected to reduce the price of the Tesla Model 3 by $2,800.

Growing: Tesla's $5billion Gigafactory - which will be able to produce 500,000 lithium-ion batteries every year - takes shape in the desert near Reno, Nevada. Once completed it will be between 5 and 6 million square feet - or the size of the Pentagon

Ambitious: The project is part of co-founder Elon Musk's plans to drive down the cost of electric cars. The South African-born entrepreneur has said the cheaper production that will come with the site will bring down the cost of the Tesla Model 3 by almost $3,000

Site preparation began in July at an industrial park along U.S. Interstate 80 15 miles east of Sparks, a Reno suburb. Since then the building has grown and looks set to be ready by the time partial production begins in 2017. 

The aim is to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 vehicles a year when it is fully completed in 2020 and produce a power source that can also be installed in gadgets such as toys and drones.

Production is currently based in Freemont, California, but the plant does not have the capacity to serve the company's future production needs. 

The facility is expected to bring 6,500 jobs to Nevada and $100 billion in economic benefits, according to CNBC. In return, the state offered Tesla up to $1.3 billion in tax breaks. 

Economic benefits have already started coming in with 700 construction jobs being created.  Projections also suggest the factory will lead to a surge in the local population - with an additional 35,000 residents moving to the area by 2032. 

It is set to be completed in 2020 and will be around 10 million square feet - as big as the Pentagon or 174 football fields.

The venture is partnered by Panasonic, who are believed to have invested billions in the motor company. 

Even though Reno has attracted big businesses such as Apple and Amazon, there is concern the city's infrastructure will not be able to cope with the increase in demand. 

Nevada's governor Brian Sandoval said it's further proof the state, that has also landed huge Switch data center expansion, is emerging as a leader in new technology innovation.

'This announcement demonstrates the possibilities within our state if we continue to recruit the growing industries of the 21st century,' he said. 

Nevada overall is expected to add 528,000 people over the next two decades, for a population of 3.3 million. That's led by an estimated 328,000-person bump in Clark County and an estimated 147,000-person gain in Washoe County.

But northern Nevada, where the gigafactory will be built, is expected to feel the most direct impact from Tesla.

Location: An image taken from the hills surrounding the complex reveal its isolation and scale 

Development: Construction has moved along at a rapid rate since November (pictured). The project is set to last for another five years but partial production is set to begin in 2017 

Future: An artist's impression shows what the site could look like when it is finished in 2020. Nevada will also benefit from an investment in roads leading to the facility and potential to surround it with other ventures
