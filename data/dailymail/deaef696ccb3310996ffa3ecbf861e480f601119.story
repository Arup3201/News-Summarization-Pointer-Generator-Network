The former residence of a Polish woman who fled the horrors of the German holocaust and rose to fame by telling her story, is on sale in Sydney' east for $4 million.

Located in one of the city's most prestigious suburbs, Woollahra, the home owned by Holocaust survivor and author Sabrina Van der Linden  Wolanksi is sure to have millionaires salivating at the mouth. The multi-million dollar high-end property not only comes with its historical footnote, but an incredibly appealing indoor and outdoor setting.

Ms Wolanski, who emigrated to Australia from Europe after World War II, enlisted renowned Australian architect Alexander Tzannes to design a three-bedroom modern masterpiece that is now the envy of every other house on Wallis Street.

The Woollahra home was owned by holocaust survivor Sabrina Van der Linden Wolanksi before she died in 2011

Wedged in one of the city's most outstanding suburbs to live, the house sits on more than 270 square metres of land. The award-winning Tzannes had class and style in mind when he designed the an uplifting sense of space, light and privacy in a blue-ribbon village setting.

Luxuriously appointed and innovatively crafted, one of the home's hallmark features is its sun soaked northerly rear aspect, and the fact it opens to a gorgeous entertainer's court garden. It is built on three storeys and has a commercial-grade kitchen, large skylight an upstairs mezzanine.

The upper level bedrooms, with a bathroom off the main, has limestone finishes and like its owner the house is sure to attract plenty of attention. Sabrina Van Der Linden Wolanski, who died in 2011, is best known for her book Destined to Live: One Woman's War, Life, Loves Remembered, which is an account of her experience of the Holocaust.

She was just 12 years old when her home town in Poland was invaded by the Nazis and in her diary she recorded everything that happened, including the humiliations and terrors, the murder of her family and her own survival.

She emigrated to Australia where she began her new life after the war, where she lost her father and brother. In 1967 Ms Wolanski gave evidence in a trial of the man who murdered both them. While there, she met the daughter of a former Nazi who was researching her own past.

In May 2005, when Germany opened the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Wolanski was chosen to speak on behalf of the six million who died. In her speech she noted that although the Holocaust had taken everything she valued, it had also taught her that hatred and discrimination are doomed to fail.

The property was once a carpet shop that was converted into a modern masterpiece that sits on 270 square metres
