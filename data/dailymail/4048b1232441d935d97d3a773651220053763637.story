It is one of the most iconic movie cliffhangers in history, with Michael Caine and his gang of gold robbers perched precariously on a mountain top.

Now, an art installation in Hong Kong has replicated the famous finale to 'The Italian Job' and balanced a full-sized replica coach  on  the luxury Peninsula Hotel.

The eye-catching display is called 'Hang On a Minute Lads, I've Got a Great Idea' and is by British artist Richard Wilson. 

Iconic: Perched on the edge of The Peninsula's seventh floor Sun Terrace, the work features a replica of a twin-axel Harrington Legionnaire coach from the classic 1969 British heist caper

The artwork is part of The Peninsula's new collaboration the Royal Academy of Arts.

The famous movie scene sees the coach dangling delicately over an Alpine ravine, after a gang of British robbers – led by Michael Caine's character Charlie Croker – have to choose between saving themselves or risking all to retrieve the gold they have stolen from Turin.

But each move they make towards the rear of the coach to reach their loot, pushes the vehicle closer to the edge.

The film ends with the famous words from Croker: 'Hang on a minute, lads – I've got a great idea.'

On the brink: The famous final scene from the 1969 film The Italian Job when Michael Caine utters the line: 'Hang on a minute, lads - I've got a great idea'

Tense: The famous movie finale sees Caine's character Charlie Croker inching towards the gold

Three years ago, the work was featured on the roof of the De La Warr Pavilion, in Bexhill, Surrey, as part of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad. 

Mr Wilson recently told TimeOut Hong Kong: 'What's always extraordinary for me is the notion of the selfie.

'"Hang On A Minute..." went around the world instantly as soon as it was launched because people wanted to stand under it. 

'The town mayor sent me a letter and said it's an absolutely fabulous piece but also sent me a parking fine. It just seemed to gel people together. 

'And I think that's similar to what's going to happen in Kowloon, where one will be on the boardwalk along the river, taking the view in, and then look up outside the hotel. It's going to be a crowd-puller.'
