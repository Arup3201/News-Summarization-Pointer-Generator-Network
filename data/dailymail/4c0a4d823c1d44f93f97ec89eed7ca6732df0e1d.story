The Indian mother who gave birth to conjoined twins last week has yet to meet her babies - because she is still coming to terms with what has happened.

The twins, who were born last week with one body and two heads, have been moved to one of India’s top hospitals for further examination.

Dr Shikha Malik, who delivered the 
babies and is helping the family, said they have two heads, two 
necks, two spines and two separate oesophaguses and trachea - but they 
have only one heart and stomach and one lung each.

The twins, born last week, each have a head, neck, spine and oesophagus.
But they share a heart and stomach and have only one lung each

The twins were born last week in northern India via C-section, weighing 7lbs 7oz

She
 added that most of their vital organs are shared. And while one baby is
 sleeping, one is crying - and the one on the right hand side of the body is so far growing much stronger.

The twins are now being treated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, in Delhi.

But the parents, Urmila and Subhash Sharma, are still recovering at Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital in Sonipat, northern India, and are slowly coming to terms with the birth of such remarkable babies.

Dr Malik said: ‘So far they are doing remarkably well. It is a gift that they have come this far.

'We can only pray that there is a future for them. We are trying all we can to help them and we’re speaking to experts from all over the world to see if there’s any chance of surgery. But it is looking unlikely at the moment.’

The babies’ father, Subhash, 32, who 
works as a labourer in a bicycle factory, said he is pinning all his 
hopes on the doctors but his priority is the health of his wife

The twins' parents, Urmila and Subhash Sharma, are still coming to terms with the birth of such remarkable babies. It has been reported the mother has yet to see the twins

Doctors say that most of the babies' vital organs are shared. And while one baby is sleeping, one is crying. The baby on the right side of the body is also growing faster

‘When my wife started to feel pain in her stomach we rushed to see a doctor. When we came to know about them there were no words, there was no way out, we were very shocked. It was all in god’s hands,’ he said.

‘I’m their father so I’ll do whatever I can for them. Whatever I’m earning will go towards my children.'

Just as I’ve cared for my daughter I will care for these babies too but the future will depend on the doctors. I’m a poor man and I will do my best for my family. Right now I am also worried about my wife. I can only hope the doctors will be able to help us.’

Urmila, 28, has only seen a photo of her conjoined babies and is yet to meet them. Her husband and three-year-old daughter Shalini are with her throughout the day as she regains her strength.

The babies have now been moved to one of India's top hospitals to see if separating them is possible

Dr Malik said: ‘She is feeling mentally drained and doesn’t feel strong enough to see her babies yet.

'Her husband will tell us when she’s ready. We can only imagine what she must be feeling, it’s a very sad case.’

Dr Malik said last week: ‘The parents are very distressed and we are helping the family the best we can.'

The babies, who together weighed 7lb 7oz when they were born, will remain at AIIMS and be closely monitored.

Dr Malik said: 'So far they are doing remarkably well. It is a gift that they have come this far'

Dr Minu Bajpai, paediatric surgeon in
 charge of the babies while at AIIMS, said: ‘We’re in the process of 
working out their anatomy and the extent of their fusion.

'Their
 respiratory elements are infected right now so we’re trying to treat 
that and we need them to stablise before we can move forward.

‘We will be doing further tests next week. This is a very rare case, it’s very complex but we’re hoping further testing will tell us more of the right way forward.’

Urmila and Subhash, who have one other daughter, were too poor to have an ultrasound during the pregnancy so complications had gone unnoticed.

Fears: The baby's mother gave birth to conjoined twins in Haryana, northern India, last week and doctors initially feared their chances of survival were slim

Dr Malik added: ‘We only came to know 
she was carrying conjoined twins after an ultrasound two weeks ago but 
it was too late to do anything by then. 

Conjoined twins who share a single body have dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment.

Because they share the same body, it is not possible to separate dicephalic parapagus twins.

Chinese doctors say Siamese 
twins born this month in Yunyang County in the country's Chongqing 
Province have a good chance of eventually being separated, if they 
survive the first few weeks after being born.

The twins were delivered at a rural hospital weighing in at 4.3 kg and were immediately put on a life support machine.

Doctors
 at the local hospital, who said they had never had to deal with Siamese
 twins before, arranged for the two babies to be sent to the larger 
Xinqiao Hospital, where they remained in intensive care largely as a 
precaution.

Doctors say that at the moment all the indications are 
that despite the fact the twin babies are small and comparatively weak, 
their vital signs are essentially steady, and there is a good chance 
they will survive.

The pair are connected from the chest to the stomach. But doctors believe they do not share vital organs, raising hope it might be possible to separate them when they are older

The pair are connected from the chest to the 
stomach, but doctors believe they do not share vital organs and 
therefore it might eventually be possible to separate them when they are
 older.

Doctor Prof. Zhang Yuping who is in charge of looking after 
the conjoined twins said: 'At the moment, the twins' vital signs are 
steady, if anything they are breathing a little fast and they seem to 
have a low blood oxygen level but other than that everything is stable.'

He
 said that the priority at the moment was to focus on sorting out their 
breathing difficulties and making sure that they ate enough in order to 
stabilise their vital signs. A full investigation will then be carried 
out to see whether separation operation will eventually be feasible.
