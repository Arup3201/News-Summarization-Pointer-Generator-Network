An East Texas woman, her brother and her parents are charged with carrying out a scheme to kill the woman's ex-husband and new wife as both sides were embroiled in a custody dispute over a 5-year-old girl, authorities said Wednesday.

Sheriff's deputies in Tyler County arrested four people Tuesday night in the parking lot of the church where Nathan and Krystal Maddox were gunned down in January after visiting the girl.

Nathan Maddox's ex-wife Kristen Westfall; her brother, Cameron; and her parents, Letha and Paul Westfall, all were indicted on charges of engaging in organized criminal activity.

Keeping it in the family: Letha Westfall and her husband Paul Westfall are the parents of Nathan's ex-wife, and Madison's mother, Kristen Westfall

Brother and sister: Kristen and Cameron Westfall were among the four members of their family taken into custody and were transported to the Tyler County jail. Their bond has been set at $1 million a piece

In custody: Kristen Westfall is led into the Tyler County Jail. Three of her relatives of have been accused of killing Nathan Bradley Maddox   and his new wife Krystal as he sought custody of his 5-year-old daughter

Letha Westfall had custody of the girl, but the Westfall family was fighting Nathan Maddox in court.

Phil Ryan, the chief deputy in Tyler County, said that the custody battle was the likely motive.

'They were worried that Nathan was doing better in his life and might get custody of the little girl,' Ryan said.

Authorities have not charged any of the four with murder, as investigators are still trying to determine who shot the couple, Ryan said.

Shot and killed: Nathan and Krystal Maddox were killed on January 18. The couple was shot following a supervised visitation with Nathan Maddox's five-year-old daughter at Mount Carmel Baptist Church

Disbelief: Rhonda Humphus, the mother of murder victim Krystal Maddox, gets a hug from her murdered son-in-law's best friend. A grand jury iindicted Maddox's ex-wife Kristen Westfall, her parents Letha and Paul Westfall, and her brother, Cameron Westfall

The couple died in the attack Jan. 18 
outside Mount Carmel Baptist Church near Colmesneil, about 110 miles 
northeast of Houston. Their daughter was inside the church with Letha 
Westfall, who had brought her for a supervised visit with her father, 
said Shari Pulliam, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Family and
 Protective Services.

After 
the shootings, state authorities placed the girl in a foster home in an 
undisclosed location, Pulliam said. The girl did not see the shooting, 
but is aware of the deaths of her father and stepmother, she said.

'We did not know who the shooter was,' Pulliam said. 'We were fearful for her life.'

Forever remembered: The family of Nathan and Krystal said that the emotions of the last week have beelike a rollercoaster, but faith and family kept them holding out hope

Nathan Maddox (right) was in the middle of a custody battle. According to him, he was close to winning. His ex-wife Kristin, had handed custody over to her parents due to previous arrests for controlled substances but his new wife Krystal (left) was shot dead

The court battle for custody has continued after the couple's deaths, with three days of hearings so far.

State
 authorities want the girl placed in foster care and said they found 
drug paraphernalia in Letha Westfall's home, as well as a gun on a 
nightstand within easy reach of the girl, Pulliam said.

Nathan
 Maddox's father, Jim, has since petitioned to become his 
granddaughter's primary caregiver. Jim Maddox's attorney, Ryan Deaton of
 Lufkin, said Wednesday it had been a struggle to get Nathan Maddox time
 to visit his daughter.

'No 
one even knew where he was getting his visits or how those visits were 
going to go or anything,' Deaton said. 'The only people who did know 
were the Westfalls and my clients. It would have been impossible for 
anyone else to do this.'
