With smartwatches  rising in popularity, figuring out how best to input text onto them has become a bit of an issue.

But Microsoft thinks they've got part of an answer with their handwriting tool.

Called the Analog Keyboard Project, it lets a user draw letters, numbers and even symbols in the middle of watch, which are then registered by the device.

Researchers at Microsoft's Redmond base in Washington have developed a writing tool for Android smart watches. The Analog Keyboard Project lets users write on the middle of the watch (shown). It can recognise letters, numbers and also some symbols

The prototype reported by Gizmodo is compatible both with square Android watches and the circular Moto 360 so far.

Most smartwatches currently employ some form of speech recognition to carry out most tasks.

Write lowercase - You can enter lowercase English letters (print), numbers, and basic punctuation symbols. Uppercase letters are not supported.

Start slowly and neatly - When using the prototype for the first time, watch the fading strokes on the writing panel and make sure they are legible and properly separated from one another. The recognition accuracy should be fairly high that way. Then try to develop a sense for how sloppy you can write while still getting good accuracy.

Frequent words like 'this', 'and', 'is' and so on will often be auto-corrected by the system once all characters have been entered, so it's generally faster to finish writing these words even if there are wrong letters along the way.

Rare words on the other hand, like names or hashtags, should be written slowly and verified character by character (auto-correct is suppressed if you pause a little after each character). 

The backspace key has a repeat function when you hold it down.

But, as the Microsoft Research team points out, there are some situations where speaking to your watch is either not appropriate or possible. 

'With the Analog Keyboard Project we are exploring handwriting recognition for text input on small touch screens,' the team writes on their site.

'Handwriting, unlike speech, is discreet and not prone to background noise.'

They also add that a handwriting method allows the whole screen to be used for each character, rather than classic typing methods where part of the screen must be obscured.

This leaves room on the left for a large backspace button, and on the right for a space bar button.

For now only lowercase English letters, numbers and basic punctuation symbols can be used.

The team advises that you should write slowly and neatly at first in order for the recognition software to get to grips with your writing style.

In addition words will be auto-corrected so, they note, it is often quicker to finish a word if an error is made rather than going back to fix something.

While it is available for download now, the team notes that it should be for research purposes only as it is still in a very early stage.
