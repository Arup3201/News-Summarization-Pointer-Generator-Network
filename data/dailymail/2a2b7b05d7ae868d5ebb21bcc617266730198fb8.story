A grandmother from Italy has accidentally poisoned herself, her partner, their son, grandchildren and one of their friends by making them hot chocolate from sachets that was 25 years out of date.

The 77-year-old woman, named only as Mrs. Rosetta, from the northeastern town of Vicenza, made the drink after her grandchildren and their friend, aged between nine and 12, asked for it, making extra cups for her son, her husband and herself.

Shortly afterwards, all of them were taken to hospital with stomach upsets and vomiting, which authorities traced to the sachets, which expired in 1990, according to Il Giornale Di Vicenza.

The woman, named as Mrs Rosetta, 77, was taken to hospital with vomiting and a stomach upset along with her husband, son, two grandchildren, and their young friend

It is thought that Mrs Rosetta bought the drink some time in the late 80s, before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen Square protests, and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister.

The chocolate powder had then laid at the bottom of her cupboard, forgotten, until one day earlier this month when one of her grandchildren asked for it to drink.

Discovering the sachets at the back of the cupboard, she promptly mixed it into warm milk and served it, with disastrous results.

According to Il Mattino her husband began suffering from vomiting and a stomach upset around an hour after drinking the chocolate, followed by herself, the children, and finally her son.

All of them had to be rushed to the emergency room for treatment, with one of the youngsters being kept in for 20 days, reports Corriere Del Veneto.

While it appears to have been an accident, the grandmother has been charged with causing injury, with a file passed to prosecutors for consideration.

Hot chocolate mix usually contains powdered cocoa and sugar, which do not usually go off but will decrease in quality over time, and powdered milk, which can go off after long periods.

Powdered milk is particularly prone to curdling over long periods if exposed to heat or moisture, or if the packaging is torn.
