Conan O'Brien isn't usually at a loss for words, but he stammered and appeared visibly shaken on Monday night as he broke the news of Robin Williams death to his studio audience.

The late-night host ended his TBS show with a brief tribute to the comedian, who is believed to have hanged himself in his California home after battling depression.

'This is absolutely shocking and horrifying and so upsetting on every level. We're at the end of the show and it felt like we just needed to acknowledge this,' he told his audience.

Shocked: Conan O'Brien - usually a quick-witted talker - was clearly grasping for the right words as he announced the death of Robin Williams to his studio audience Monday

 

Williams' suicide was already the talk of the world when Conan aired at 11pm. However, at the time of the show's taping, the news was still fresh and many in the studio audience didn't know what had happened.

Conan, normally quick-witted, grasped to find the right words. It was clear that he, too, was coming to terms with 63-year-old Williams' death as he reported it.

'I know that everybody here, we've all worked with Robin over the years,' he said, his eyes rimmed red. 

Conan's guests, comedians Andy Richter and Will Arnett appeared nearly as shaken as the host. 

'As funny as he was - he's probably one of the all-time greats - he was even better as a person. He was even more fantastic. He was just the loveliest, sweetest, one of the kindest guys that I've ever worked with,' Arnett said.

Robin Williams' death on Monday afternoon shocked the entertainment world and fans everywhere. Conan revealed in a previous interview that Williams was his first big brush with showbiz

'Just such a soft, warm emotionally sweet guy. And it's a major major loss for everybody.'

Richter said: 'He was an amazingly kind and generous person.' 

In one of Conan's last interviews with Williams, the late-night host revealed that the 'Mrs. Doubtfire' star was his first brush with real celebrity.

Conan said he was a young Saturday Night Live writer when Williams was hosting the comedy show.

'One of my first vivid showbiz memories is that I walk by your dressing room and you have your shirt off - I think you were doing a quick change,' Conan explained. 

'This is the hairiest man I have ever seen in my life.'

Conan's famous cackle was on full display during Williams' energetic previous interview. Conan was solemn on Monday after announcing the news of the comedian's death. 

 He closed the show with: 'We're going to end our show now, thank all our guests and goodnight and god bless Robin Williams.'
