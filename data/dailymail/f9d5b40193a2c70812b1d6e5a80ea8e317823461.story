Sarah Midwinter was told that skin tapping is now banned in non-clinical environments

A woman, who has given blood for 30 years, was stunned when she was turned away from a donor session because of a new safety ruling.

Medical staff told Sarah Midwinter, 53, that they were no longer allowed to tap her arm to help bring her vein to the surface and she was forced to leave a facility setup at her local church.

The incident has sparked concern that millions of people across the country will be deterred from donating at 
temporary centres at a time when blood is desperately needed.

Traditionally before a blood donation
takes place, the skin is wiped clean with sterile solution and then a 
small area is tapped to raise the vein.

But a new hygiene ruling states that the skin cannot be touched once it has been cleaned in case infection is spread.

NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) - 
which manages national blood, tissue and organ donations - says this 
procedure can now only be carried out in clinics where surgical gloves 
can be worn by staff.

Ms Midwinter from Bishops Nympton near South Molton, Devon, said: 'When I gave blood in the past the nurse would tap my arm to bring the vein to the surface.

'But when I went to give blood at the
local church I was told nurses were not allowed to touch my skin due to
a new hygiene rule.

'They said there was a danger of infection.'

Ms Midwinter has the 'universal' O negative blood type and has donated 50 pints in her lifetime to help save lives.

When she was told about the new rule in December she even offered to tap her arm 
herself while wearing gloves and was willing to sign a waiver to allow 
the nurse to do it for her - but her donation was still declined.

The nurse revealed that at least five other donors had been turned away for the same reason that day.

She added: 'It is crazy. It makes me very cross. 
This has never been an issue in the past and it seems ridiculous when 
the NHS is always appealing for new donors.

Experts recently predicted a 'dramatic' decline in donations because of major events like the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee

'I want to see this rule scrapped. It will put people off giving blood.

'I'm
a keen horse rider and am always aware I could have an accident and 
need blood. It is really important to donate and I've been doing it on 
and off since I was 18. I'm upset that this silly rule is stopping 
that.'

It is only patients with thin veins, such as Ms Midwinter, that need their skin tapping and those with prominent veins are unaffected by the new regulation.

Jo Tossell, NHSBT's director of 
Infection Prevention and Control, said: 'As many of our sessions are in public venues we set a minimum acceptable standard of cleanliness.

'Clinically clean environments would be required for staff to routinely use sterile gloves for blood donation.

'The antiseptic solution used must be allowed to air dry completely after application to the donor's skin before the venepuncture. Once this has been done, the prepared area must not be touched with fingers before the needle is inserted.

'Providing that the clinical standards set by NHSBT are applied, we maintain the safety of our donors and the patients receiving blood - this is of paramount importance to maintain public confidence.'

Experts recently predicted a 'dramatic' decline in donations because of major events like the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

The NHS predicts approximately two million units of blood will be needed by hospitals throughout 2012, and the equivalent of 500 extra donations will be needed each week in the first six months to help them build blood stocks.
