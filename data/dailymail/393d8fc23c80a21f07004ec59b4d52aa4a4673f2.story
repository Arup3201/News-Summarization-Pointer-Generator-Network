A high school honor student who was suspended for seven weeks after joking on Twitter that he'd made out with one of his teachers has switched schools.

Reid Sagehorn, who was the captain of the football and basketball teams and had a 3.8 grade-point average at Rogers High School in Minnesota, started classes on Monday morning.

The switch to the new school - which has not been named - comes despite weeks of protests from his fellow schoolmates and friends after the social media slip-up.

The scandal has also engulfed the local police chief,
 who said Sagehorn could face a felony charge for the joke, before 
recanting it and saying he would only face a misdemeanor. The attorney's
 office later disputed this too, saying Sagehorn had not committed a 
crime.

Regret: High school senior Reid Sagehorn spoke out on Saturday after he was suspended earlier this year for joking online that he had made out with a teacher. The teenager has switched schools amid the scandal

Sorry: Sitting beside his parents, he said he apologized to the teacher and never intended to hurt anyone

The fallout came after someone asked Sagehorn whether he had
 ever 'made out' with the school's female P.E. teacher, 28, on a page called 'Rogers 
Confessions' on Q&A site ask.fm and he responded: 'Actually, yes.'

The tweet led to the 
teacher being interviewed by police which will remain on her permanent 
record. She was not found to have committed any crime and was unaware of
 the rumors.

Sagehorn spoke out at the weekend and said he had apologized in writing to the teacher, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

'I think it's definitely important that everybody who has heard about the story know how sincerely sorry I am,' he said as he sat next to his parents at his attorney's Minneapolis office.

'There was nothing behind [the tweet]... I thought everybody would take it as a joke.'

But he added: 'No matter how I meant it, [it] doesnâ€™t matter. Sarcasm doesnâ€™t belong on the Internet.'

Sagehorn, who plans to attend North Dakota State University later this year, said he is nervous about returning to class and has suffered anxiety attacks since he was suspended.

He recounted being called to the school office after a parent had called the office and suggested there had been a possibly inappropriate relationship between Sagehorn and the teacher.

Last week, Rogers Police Chief Jeff Beahen said he could be charged with a felony for defamation but later admitted he could only be charged with was a gross misdemeanor. But the Hennepin County attorney's office ruled Sagehorn had not committed a crime.

Beahen now says he regrets suggesting that a felony may have been committed and admits he made a mistake.

Top student: Sagehorn was the football and basketball teams and an honor student at the school

Students have set up a petition after the 17-year-old student was suspended from school for his Twitter remark

Sagehorn's attorneys lambasted Beahan as an 'imbecile' and said his comments had affected the teenager's reputation, but they declined to discuss legal avenues the family might explore.

The teacher has continued to work at 
the school in what has turned into a difficult environment. It has 
caused her to miss some days from the classroom but school officials say
 they are 'supportive'.

A teachers' union is providing legal counsel and emotional support to her.

Sagehorn has seen immense support from his fellow students. An online petition was set up to reverse his suspension and was signed by several thousand supporters.
