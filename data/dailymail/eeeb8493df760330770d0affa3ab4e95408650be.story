An eight-year-old boy who authorities say died after being beaten had remained in the house where the alleged abuse occurred despite six investigations by social workers during the past decade, a newspaper said.

The boy's mother, 29-year-old Pearl 
Fernandez, and her 32-year-old boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, have been 
charged with murder. They have not yet entered pleas.

Social workers appeared to miss numerous warnings signs at the Palmdale, California, home, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday, citing county documents.

Monstrous allegations: Pearl Sinthia Fernandez (left) and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre (right), are accused of torturing and killing the woman's 8-year-old son

Angel: Gabriel, 8, was found unconscious and not breathing, suffering from a fractured skull, cracked ribs and cigarette burns to his body

The boy, Gabriel, had written a note saying he 
was thinking about suicide and his teacher told authorities he often 
appeared bruised and battered.

Fernandez was being held without 
bail, while Aguirre was being held on $1 million bail.  It has not yet 
been determined if they have lawyers.

Gabriel died at a hospital on May 24 
after paramedics went to his house in Palmdale and found that he had a 
fractured skull, three broken ribs, BB pellets embedded in his lung and 
groin, and two teeth knocked out.

The documents obtained by the paper 
show Aguirre allegedly told investigators that he beat the boy 
repeatedly for lying and being dirty.

Pearl Fernandez told paramedics her son's injuries were due to self-mutilation, the paper reported.

Meanwhile, four social workers have been given desk duty pending possible disciplinary action.

'I feel like they all should be 
fired,' said Elizabeth Carranza, Gabriel's aunt. 'They didn't listen to 
my nephew. They were completely deaf and blind.'

There were six investigations into abuse allegations involving the mother, with five determining the claims were unfounded.

Records show there was an unresolved 
case of alleged abuse at the time of Gabriel's death, and an allegation 
had lingered two months past a legally mandated deadline for finishing 
an investigation.

'The red flags were all over the 
place. They were ignored. It is just inexplicable to me,' said county 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.

Crime scene: Firefighters responded to this home in the 200 block of East Avenue Q-10 in Palmdale after receiving a report that a child was not breathing

Horrific claims: Police say Gabriel had marking on his ankles, suggesting that he may have been tied up

Slain angel: The mother of the little boy told police that she was present for his assault, but did nothing to stop it

History of violence: Fernandez had previously been charged with cruelty to a child likely to produce great bodily injury

The county's Department of Children 
and Family Services has been trying to institute reforms after dozens of
abuse and neglect deaths in recent years involving children who had 
been under the agency's supervision.

A recent internal review of the 
department found there haven't been any workers fired in 15 cases where 
children died. It also has a backlog of child abuse cases.

The agency's director Philip Browning
acknowledged the system failed Gabriel. The case illustrates a need for
more critical thinking and common sense in evaluating cases, he said.

County social workers became aware of
Pearl Fernandez a decade ago when her oldest son had a head injury 
during a car accident. It was determined he wasn't wearing a seat belt.

The Times said a relative later 
reported she allegedly beat the same son and wanted to disown him. 
However, social workers said the complaint was unfounded.

Family divided: Fernandez's own father said it was his daughter who was responsible for his grandson's death

Gabriel's teacher told authorities in
January there were bruised dots all over the boy's face. Gabriel told 
the teacher his mother shot him in the face with a BB gun, records show.

The boy often recanted his stories, 
and an internal county review criticized social workers for failing to 
interview Gabriel in a neutral setting away from his mother, who told 
social workers in March she didn't need their help.

The boy's therapist told workers 
earlier this year that Gabriel once reported being sexually abused by an
older relative, but he later withdrew the allegation. The investigation
remains open.

In addition to one count of murder 
each, the charges against Fernandez and Aguirre include a 
special-circumstance allegation of torture.

Gabriel’s grandfather told NBC Los Angeles in Spanish that he believes it was his daughter, Fernandez, who is responsible for her son's death.

He said that the child had lived with the grandparents until five months ago, but the 29-year-old mother was allowed to regain custody of him.

Aguirre's family rallied around him, with his mother and other relatives insisting that he is innocent.

'He loved those kids. She did it, and everybody knows she did it. Even her family knows she did it,' said Aguirre's cousin.

Fernandez had previously been charged with cruelty to a child likely to produce great bodily injury.

Public outcry: Protesters carrying posters and pictures of Gabriel gathered outside the courtroom, demanding justice and blaming the Department of Child and Family Services for failing to protect the little boy
