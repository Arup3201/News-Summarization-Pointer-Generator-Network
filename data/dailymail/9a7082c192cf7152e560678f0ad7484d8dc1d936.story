At ground level there is nothing out of the ordinary about the former Atlas E missile base in Dover, Kansas.

But delve below the surface and beyond the military detritus and you will soon discover a subterranean wonderland.

Ambitious Edward Peden spent 12 years converting the bunker into the place he now calls home.

Where once there was a cutting-edge missile ready to be deployed at the height of the Cold War, there are now homely rugs, sofas and even a few bongos.

The former schoolteacher purchased the 37 acre site in 1983 for $48,000, converting one third of the 18,000 square feet silo into a living space for his family.

When he initially drove out to investigate the area, near his hometown of Topeka, Kansas, most of the concrete tunnel labyrinth was flooded with rainwater.

Not put off by what lay below him, Mr Peden undressed to his shorts, climbed below ground level using a rope ladder and swam in between the different chambers.

The Topeca base, opened in 1961, was one of dozens of gigantic underground bases built by the U.S. Government during the Cold War.

The hardy structures were designed to withstand nuclear attack, housing specialist weaponry themselves.

Mr Peden's base was formerly occupied by an Atlas missile, a 4 megaton thermonuclear warhead.

The base, however, was quickly decommissioned when the weapons became outdated and it was decided that the missile bay doors took too long to open.

Since its closure, the base lay empty - until Mr Peden purchased the site.

Examining the chamber, Mr Peden said: 'There was an Atlas missile here. Every home should have one, right?

'A 47 ton door would open and
they could back a large semi truck in here with a missile, and then the
missile that was lying horizontal here would be drawn upward, erected, 
and then it would be fueled, ready for launch.'

The missile was over 
seven stories tall and ten times more powerful than the atomic bombs 
dropped on Japan.

'This silo was rated to withstand a single mega ton 
air burst about a mile from the structure, Mr Peden said.

'We don't feel 
very worried about tornadoes. There's probably 10, 15 feet of earth over
us here.

'So we're really in the ground. The launch control 
room is now our living room. We pretend to have windows.'

Mr Peden now runs a missile base brokers, selling sites similar to his.
