Some would recommend it for a weekend stay while others are full of praise for the lovely rooms, attentive staff and interesting decor.

The food is seen as good and the quality of beds and level of services have helped HMP Liverpool earn a three star rating that some hotels across the country can only dream of. 

And with its score and recommendations for a short break, the men's prison doesn't lag far behind the Ritz in London. 

The hilarious TripAdvisor style reviews have been posted by people via Facebook, who imagine what a stay in the large prison might involve. 

The reviews have been posted via Facebook and have led to HMP Liverpool achieving a 3.1 aggregate rating 

The comments rated the prison for its decor and staff, and allowed reviewers to give it a mark out of five stars

HMP Liverpool, which can house around 1,200 prisoners, has been rated as a 'great hotel' in comic reviews 

And it would appear the perceived knowledge of staff and decor of the rooms have led it be branded an 'amazing hotel' by the prison's legion of tongue-in-cheek fans. 

Helen Jackson gave the prison four stars for the 'lovely food' and balanced her review as she added 'rooms very small but comfortable.'

Ellis Hamer wrote: 'Amazing hotel. Great food, very luxurious rooms and highly skilled and attentive staff. Highly recommended for a weekend break or a longer stay.'

Meanwhile, Kenny Baker said it was a 'Great little hotel', while Paul Hilton hailed the 'great' food and staff.

Some posts offered the balance seen in many reviews, criticising the 1855 prison's 'dated' accommodation

Another post poked fun at the 'unruly' nature of the occupants of the prison

One poster suggested popping into the jail for a 'cuppa' with the 'great staff' of the jail

John McDermott wrote: 'Great staff, great food and above you can do as you please open all year round. Call in for a chat and cuppa. 

But, just like with any hotel, there are some downsides. Karen Regan wrote: 'I hope not to repeat my vacation there, as so many have done before me.

'I will be writing a strongly worded letter about the total and utter shoddinness of Walton and I will be also be informing the editor of my local newspaper and imploring them to please make their readers, who may have considered a vacation at Walton, aware of just how deplorable the conditions there are.'

Reviewers have given the prison ratings out of a maximum five, with it achieving a 3.1 star aggregate score

The prison is yet to issue a TripAdvisor style response to the criticism, but the reviewers wait in anticipation. 

HMP Liverpool was built in 1855 and has a capacity of 1,247. It holds prisoners convicted of category B and C offences - such as kidnapping, arson and racially-aggravated assault.

It has come under criticism for its conditions, with a report earlier this year finding that prisoners felt unsafe and that overcrowding was a problem. The review also identified staff shortages and recommended it for urgent improvement.
