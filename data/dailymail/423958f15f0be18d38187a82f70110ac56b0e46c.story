TV presenter Jonathan Ross has posted a series of hilarious pictures of unrecognisable celebrity waxworks on his Twitter page after a trip to a museum – but can you work out who they are supposed to represent without peeking at the name tags?

Mr Ross, 54, and his family visited the Louis Tussaud's Waxworks Museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in Canada over the weekend.

In one tweet he wrote: ‘It's almost like Canada want to start a war. Here's the Queen...’ with a picture of a waxwork with only the faintest passing resemblance to her Majesty.

The Louis Tussaud's Waxworks Museum website boasts: ‘Louis Tussaud's Waxworks is a collection of instantly recognizable, true-to-life wax figures crafted by recognized wax artists from around the world.’

The building houses more than 100 ‘true-to-life’ wax figures in 16 themed galleries.

The collection features both the famous and the infamous, including film stars, politicians and religious figures along with well-known musicians.

Guests have the opportunity to sit on Oprah's couch, jump into bed with Yoko and John Lennon, and even measure up to Arnold Schwarzenenegger.

Why the long face? As the gun and bow tie suggest, this figure (left) is another Bond - while (right) is an emaciated version of a former PM

Louis Tussaud was the great-grandson of Marie Tussaud, creator of the Madame Tussauds wax museums.

He worked at Madame Tussauds museum as a wax figure sculptor but eventually left and set up on his own. He founded a waxwork museum in London’s Regent street in 1890, which was destroyed in a fire just a year later.

Louis Tussaud's waxwork museum in Great Yarmouth, which closed in October 2012, was described as the world's worst waxworks museum because so many of its models looked nothing like the people they were supposed to represent.

His museums are not connected to his great-grandmother's Madame Tussauds waxwork museums.

The Niagara Falls attraction has mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, with many guests complaining they needed to read the name tags in order to identify who the waxworks were supposed to represent.

MailOnline has contacted the museum for a comment. 

The museum's manager, Tim Parker, said: 'We had a great time' was one of his reply tweets. Wax figures and their likenesses are always subject to everyones own individual perception and interpretation of wax celebrities.

'We do look to provide our guests with a rare opportunity to experience and get up close, and take an interactive photo with over 150 wax figures of some of the world's top celebrities.

'Louis Tussaud's has been open since 1957 in Niagara Falls and we have entertained millions of guests and families for over 60 years and we will continue to do so.'
