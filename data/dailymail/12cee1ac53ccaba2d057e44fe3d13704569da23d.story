The university student who pleaded guilty to accessing details of a $60,000 scholarship awarded to the Prime Minister's daughter today escaped conviction and was sentenced to a two year good behaviour bond.

Freya Newman, 21, was a casual library assistant at the Whitehouse Institute of Design when in May she used her position to seek information about Frances Abbott's enrolment. Newman then handed the information to journalists.

Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan cited Ms Newman's remorse and emotional immaturity  in handing down the sentence at the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Tuesday morning.

'I accept that she was motivated by a sense of injustice, rather than notoriety... or greed,' Ms O'Sullivan said, referring to arguments made by defence counsel at previous hearings.

Supporters gathered outside Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Tuesday morning, calling for Freya to be 'freed' and condemning the 

Ms Newman could have faced a maximum custodial sentence of two years imprisonment. Shielded by family members and donning dark sunglasses, the 21-year-old refused to comment as she left court today. 

Ms O'Sullivan said Ms Newman's offence was at the 'lowest end' of the scale and told a courtroom cramped with media and supporters that the university communications student had 'good prospects of rehabilitation'.

But while the magistrate added that Ms Newman's actions had done harm to the community and the victim, she told the court the  university student had not accessed sensitive documents, just material that was not in the public domain.

'She made no attempt to conceal her actions and resigned from the institution the following day,' the magistrate said.

Ms O'Sullivan said other Whitehouse staff members had briefed Ms Newman in how she could access documents that detailed Ms Abbott's scholarship by using another staff member's log-in.

Isolated protesters held up placards of support for Ms Newman and condemnation of the Abbott family prior to the hearing.

It was revealed earlier this month that Ms Newman had sent a letter of apology to Frances Abbott. 

Ms Abbott told The Australian it was 'not right to hack into anything' but that she was trying to move on from the saga.

'I guess in that situation, I'm trying to move forward with everything, but it's just one of those things,' Ms Abbott was quoted saying. 

'I wish Freya all the best and, moving forward, we all make mistakes. Obviously, (Freya) acknowledged her mistake so moving forward, moving on'.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Ms Abbott and the Prime Minister's office for comment on Tuesday morning.
