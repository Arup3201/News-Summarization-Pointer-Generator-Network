Brutal: Roosevelt Mondesir allegedly set his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child on fire

A woman was severely burned after being covered in gasoline and set on fire by her knife-wielding ex-boyfriend and father of her child, police said.

The 40-year-old, who has not been named, suffered the horrific attack outside a 7-Eleven store in South Florida following a row with Roosevelt Mondesir, when they met so that she could pick up her son.

She was waiting outside the store in her silver Mercedes at around 3am on Monday when Mondesir showed up in his white Jaguar without the boy and began hurling the fuel over her, Boynton Beach Police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said.

She tried to run away and headed into the store for safety, attempting to hold the door shut.

But the 52-year-old man chased her with a large knife, possibly a machete, got the door open to pull her out and then ignited her.

In
graphic surveillance video which captured the horrifying attack, a man can be seen threatening a woman with a
large knife, struggling in the doorway of the store.

Tricked: Roosevelt Mondesir showed up but without their son in Boynton Beach, Florida

'Get away from 
me!' she can be heard shouting.

They disappear from view until she returns in a massive fireball, screaming and running around the parking lot.

The suspect then fled on foot. Officers searched by foot, with a 
police dog, and by helicopter before finding Mondesir three hours 
later in bushes near the 7-Eleven.

He
was charged with attempted first-degree murder and was being treated 
for burns at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach before being 
transferred to jail.

On his Facebook page Mondesir has himself listed as 'engaged' and his employment as a truck driver. He lists his interests as classical music, ESPN and the British comedy series My Family.

One of Roosevelt's neighbor in a subdivision of Lake Worth told CBS 12 that she was shocked upon learning about the attack.

'I'm stunned. He's not that kind of person.'

Police haven't said what specifically led to the attack, but they have been called to the Lake Worth house multiple times times.

In February he was accused of threatening the victim and destroying her furniture, the CBS affiliate reported.

In March they were summoned again for a physical altercation. After the woman moved out of the 
home, police reports say she received text messages including one that 
read 'I'm all about revenge.'

It was not known if he had yet obtained an attorney.

The victim is expected to survive. She was being treated at Delray Medical Center.
