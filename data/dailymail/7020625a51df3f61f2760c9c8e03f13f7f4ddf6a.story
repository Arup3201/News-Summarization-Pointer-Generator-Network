He came to Britain as a ten-year-old schoolboy, escaping his war-torn Kosovan homeland to a promising future in a safe new home.

But yesterday, 13 years after arriving, child refugee poster boy Arben Dumani was unmasked as the boss of a drugs gang behind a plot to flood the country that gave him refuge with £1.2m of cocaine.

Unrepentant Dumani stood in the dock as prosecutors described a drug dealing enterprise involving him and with his three henchmen as on a ‘virtually industrial scale’.

Jailed: Kosovan refugee Arben Dumani, 23, became the boss of a gang plotting to smuggle drugs into the UK - just 13 years after being granted refuge to live in the country

During a dawn raid on a safe house in Glasgow last year, officers seized over 2kg of the Class A drug and substances and equipment used to bulk out the pure drugs.

The mob helped bring about their own downfall by taking mobile phone photos of themselves snorting cocaine laid out to spell their names.

The four – all originally from Eastern Europe – were sentenced to a total of 30 years and six months at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.

Detective Chief Superintendent Athol Aitken said: ‘This serious organised crime group, led by Arben Dumani, was involved in the importation of cocaine with an estimated street value of £1.2million.

‘This was a significant quantity of drugs that would have caused untold harm to Scottish communities and I welcome the court result which will ensure the individuals involved are held accountable for their crimes.’

Dumani was just 10 when he and his relatives escaped the horrors of their Kosovan homeland for a new life in Glasgow.

In 1999, it was reported how he and six other child refugees started their first day at their new school in the city’s west end.

Young Dumani - speaking through an interpreter - said at the time: ‘It was good - we played football and met a lot of new friends.

‘I drew pictures of houses and I am learning the days of the week in English. It was interesting and I was happy.’

But yesterday, the 23-year-old was locked up for 12 years after he was convicted of being concerned in the supply of cocaine after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.

His right hand man Albert Memia, 25, was sentenced to 10 years after he pleaded guilty to the same charge.

Couriers Fabion Ponari, 23, and Gjeorgj Pjetri, 28, were locked up for five years and three and a half years respectively.

Judge
 Michael O’Grady QC said to Dumani and Memia: ‘This operation that you 
two were an integral part of was exceptional in its planning, 
sophistication and scope.

‘You
 were responsible for physically setting up a drug processing plant and 
responsible for processing and intending to distribute class A drugs.’ 

Hidden stash: These packages of cocaine were just two of many that the gang planned to distribute in the UK

Evidence: Officers found this cocaine pellet mould during a dawn raid on the gang's safe house in Glasgow

Sophisticated operation: Glasgow High Court heard the gang had set up a drug processing plant and were intending to distribute class A drugs

A hydraulic press, used to press cocaine into blocks, was also found in the bathroom of the gang's safe house

Packaged up: Cocaine pellets, each weighing seven grams, were uncovered at the safe house
