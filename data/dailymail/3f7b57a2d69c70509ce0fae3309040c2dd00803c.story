One is 6ft tall, British, good at putting on a show and has tweeted a selfie.

He's also been trained to recognise gestures such as a wave, 
  say hello and is used to shaking a lot of hands.

The other, you will be surprised to hear, is David Cameron.

Britain's Prime Minister shook hands with a life-sized robot seemingly built in his image today at a technology fair in Germany. Seconds later, the robot apparently retweeted a snap of the moment.

Mr Cameron, who has also been known to tweet selfies, was in Germany to open CeBIT, the world's largest technology fair, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The star attraction was RoboThespian an impressive humanoid robot built by the Cornish firm Engineered Arts. It was originally developed as an attempt to save exhibition guides from tediously repeating the same tour each day.

However, it is now used for education around the world and has also been used to produce a live stage show with real robots while also makes appearances in plays in South Korea.

The RoboThespian is equipped with cameras, depth perception and facial recognition. It is 
  capable of reacting to its audience and adapting its script accordingly.

The battery-powered robots are produced in a factory in Penryn, Cornwall, where it takes engineers 
  around a week to build one of the human-like machines from scratch.

A single 
  robot starts at around £55,000 each.

RoboThespian can also be controlled remotely by people using a tablet in another room, 
  while his facial expression can also be changed.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron pledged £45million for new research to help scientists develop a new ideal known as the 'internet of things'.

The
 UK is the event's official partner country, and Mr Cameron used the 
event to promote Britain to more than 2,500 industry representatives and
 set out how the UK and Germany should partner to lead the next digital 
revolution.

The two countries will work together on 5G broadband, enabling faster internet that would be quick enough to download a full length feature film in less than a second.

And they will also collaborate on the 'internet of things' – getting everyday objects talking to one another to simplify daily life.

Mr Cameron said that strengthening the innovation sector will help to create a new wave of jobs and provide a more financially secure future for Britain, for hardworking people and their families.

'This is a world on fast forward,' he said. 'A world of permanent technological revolution. And in this world, countries like the UK and Germany will only succeed if we have a relentless drive for new ideas and innovations.

'The UK tech scene today is dynamic. Relentlessly ambitious. Leading the way. It is our ambition to make the UK the most digital nation in the G8 and it is my mission to show the world that we’re getting there.'
