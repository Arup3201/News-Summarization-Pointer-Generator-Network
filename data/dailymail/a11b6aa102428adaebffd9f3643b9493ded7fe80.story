Aston Villa face a summer of turmoil and uncertainty as owner Randy Lerner officially put the club up for sale.

Transfer business has been put on hold and manager Paul Lambert’s position was cast into doubt after the American billionaire said he wanted to leave behind the ‘fickle’ business of English football.

He compared himself to a Shunammite, a biblical person of wealth who is well-respected in society, and wants to ‘get on with other aspects of my career’ after several years of ‘week in, week out battles’.

Selling up: Randy Lerner has formally announced his intention to sell Aston Villa after eight years in charge

Uncertain: The decision to sell leaves Paul Lambert's future looking uncertain, especially since Villa could only finish 15th in the Premier League

Unspectacular: Villa finished 15th in the Premier League, just five points above the relegation zone

Transfer fees spent: £200million

Biggest signing: Darren Bent (2011) £24million

Biggest sale: James Milner (2010) £26million

Highest finish: 6th (2008, 2009, 2010)

Lerner has been searching for a buyer for months, and talks with an associate in the United States stalled, but has now made public his intentions in a bid to attract concrete offers in the region of £200million.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been tasked with handling the exchange but no timescale has been placed on the purchase, and with such a large amount of money at stake any conclusion is not likely to come quickly.

That renders Lambert’s ambitions to move on transfer targets extremely difficult and third parties have been made aware that any potential deals will not be acted upon with budgets unclear.

Lambert has repeatedly stressed that significant investment in the playing squad is required to lift the team out of a fifth consecutive season of struggle next year.

Lerner’s confirmation places Lambert’s role under greater scrutiny, however, with no assurances given that the 44-year-old Scot would remain in charge if a new owner was found.

Last month Lambert said: ‘Listen, if a new guy comes in and doesn’t like you…It’ s not something I’ve ever thought about it. I’ve not been a part of that but as far as I’m concerned, I want to be here.’

The club took also took the 
last-minute step of cancelling the end-of-season awards dinner scheduled
 for tonight, in light of the statement from Lerner.

Tickets
 for the bash, described as the biggest event in the club’s calendar, 
cost £85 per head and have been sold out for some time, but Villa 
decided it was not in good interest to throw a party.

The Shunammite woman was a wealthy and well respected person in the society. This is how the Bible described her.

The Shunammite woman's life teaches important lessons about these three essential qualities: contentment, a kind of heart, persistence

Lerner, former Cleveland Browns owner, bought Villa for £62.6m to own in 2006 and invested some £217m in his search for Champions League football under Martin O’Neill. But since 2010 he has reigned in spending and rarely been seen at Villa Park.

In the latest accounts for Lerner’s holding company Villa debts to him stood at £179m, but he converted £90m worth into equity last December. It is not clear whether the asking price covers this substantial debt.

Merrill Lynch believe there will be no shortage of interested buyers from across the globe – and in promotional material stated the club has ‘almost 1m known supporters’, but it remains to be seen if a bid to match Lerner’s thinking is lodged.

‘I have come to know well that fates are fickle in the business of English football,’ said Lerner. ‘And I feel that I have pushed mine well past the limit. The last several seasons have been week in, week out battles and having now come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very meaningful injuries and constant sale rumours, I feel further that now is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership.

‘I have asked the world of Paul Lambert and Paul Faulkner and they have both delivered selflessly. On a personal level it is time for me, like the Shunammite, to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of my career, following a sale.

‘Above all, the debt I owe Aston Villa whether as owner, Chairman, custodian or simply as a fan is to put the Club first. To make good on that debt, I owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job.’

Several
 weeks back I said that following the end of the season I would clarify 
my future role with the club, and address what had become seemingly 
constant rumours of a sale. I have come to know well that fates are 
fickle in the business of English football. And I feel that I have 
pushed mine well past the limit.

The
 last several seasons have been week in, week out battles and having now
 come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very 
meaningful injuries and constant sale rumours, I feel further that now 
is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership. I 
have asked the world of Paul Lambert and Paul Faulkner and they have 
both delivered selflessly. On a personal level it is time for me, like 
the Shunammite, to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of 
my career, following a sale.

Above
 all, the debt I owe Aston Villa whether as owner, Chairman, custodian 
or simply as a fan is to put the club first. To make good on that debt, I
 owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership,
 if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job.

During
 my time with Villa, I have tried to strengthen and improve the club's 
physical infrastructure both at Villa Park and Bodymoor Heath while also
 trying to carry on the McGregor tradition of being mindful of the local
 community we serve. Above all in this effort is the connection the club
 has made with Acorns; the caring, kindness and warmth that players, 
staff, managers and supporters have shown to Mr Strudley and Acorns has 
wiped away all disappointments and sobered my finest memories.

Still,
 I can see now that it is time, if possible, to hand these privileges 
and responsibilities to the next person or group to take the club 
forward. I am appreciative of the support I have received, even in these
 last years of comparative struggle when criticism was due, and will 
look on with others - with fingers crossed, for stronger future 
performance appropriate to our size and heritage.

On
 a practical level, the club will continue with its normal operations 
and plans for the summer. I've no doubt that the core staff at both 
Villa Park and BMH, to whom I owe a massive debt of friendship and 
loyalty, will continue to guide and protect the club through this period
 of transition according to their collective sense of professional pride
 and long term service to Villa - the vast majority having preceded my 
tenure.

Finally, in light of the above, I have engaged Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the sale of Aston Villa.
