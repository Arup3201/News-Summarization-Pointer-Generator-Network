As one of Hennes most anticipated collaboration to date, Isabel Marant’s new collection for the high street label has fashion fans sharpening their elbows for the inevitable crush on launch day, November 14.

However, with days until its official launch in the UK, pieces have already started cropping up on auction site eBay. 

The collection, which includes a range of casual and smart day wear, is priced between  £14.99 - £199.99. On the auction site, bids have gone up to £400 for individual pieces, with some accruing a staggering 100 per cent mark up on retail price.

(Above left model wears jacket, £199.99; trousers, £69.99, T-shirt, £24.99, mid-heel pumps, £99.99 while Milla, right is seen in dress, £69.99 and boots, £149.99; all Isabel Marant for H&M)

So where are the clothes coming from? H&M told mail Online that ‘guests at our Isabel Marant Pour H&M global press event held in Paris last week were given the opportunity to shop the collection in a pop-up store’.

It's not unusual for popular lines to go on sale in advance of a launch, supplied by the fashion insiders invited to events such as these

What is unusual is that almost all of the items offered on the auction site won't be dispatched until November 14.

Website Fashionista takes this to mean that the sellers don't actually have the goods.They've reached out for an explanation but received no responses.

They point out the majority of the items for sale are from a couple of UK sellers who claim to have certain items in every size and who will not send until the day the collection launches in the shops.

There is no indication of pre-order purchasing on the H&M website and no more VIP shopping events taking place beforehand. It's a all a bit of a mystery - we'd take our chances in store on November 14, especially since the ebay prices are higher than the high street ones.

This is not the first time that the Swedish fashion house has experienced early re-sell. The exact same thing occured last year when the brand launched its collaborative collection with Belgian fashion designer Maison Martin Margiela after a star-studded launch in New York.

The Isabel Marant collection for H&M features the designer's signature urban, boho, Parisian style.

Model Alek Wek wears wool cardigan, £79.99; leather trousers, £179.99; top, £59.99; boots, £149.99

Lou Doillon adorns trousers, £59.99; peasant blouse, £59.99; boots, £149.99; all by H&M

Speaking about the venture, Marant commented that she is ’flattered by this collaboration: H&M works with the best designers and this invitation is an exciting honour.

‘I aim at creating something real, that women want to wear in their everyday lives, with a certain carelessness, which I think is very Parisian: you dress up, but do not pay too much attention and still look sexy.

‘The collection is infused with this kind of easiness and attitude. Everything can be mixed following one’s own instincts: my take on fashion is all about personality.’

Tailored look: Coat, £99.99; white jeans, £59.99; top, £59.99; boots, £149.99

Suited and booted: Coat, £99.99; leather trousers, £179.99; T-shirt, £29.99 and boots, £149.99

The most desirable pieces from the collection, modelled by Milla Jovovich, Alek Wek and Lou Doillon, include a fringed and beaded collarless jacket; monochrome trousers, shirts and dresses alongside tailored pieces, fringed boots, wool cardigans and leather trousers.

The extensive collection is also completed with a wide range of accessories, menswear and teenage pieces.

Isabel Marannt Pour H&M launches in 250 stores nationwide on 14 November 2013. For more information go to www.hm.com
