They are the prodigies, the rising stars of the global game. Flourishing for club and country, these teenagers are hoping to make their breakthrough on the world stage - and soon.

With the international week in full swing, we take a look at 10 of the most exciting players on the planet under the age of 20 and what they've achieved in their careers so far.

MOSQUITO (18, Brazil Under 20 and Atletico Paranaense)

Don't be fooled by the funny name, Mosquito - or Thiago Rodrigues da Silva - is one of the hottest properties in Brazil. 

The striker was part of the incredibly talented Under 20 squad that went goal crazy in winning the Toulon Tournament in the summer and has long been admired by many of the European heavyweights. 

Now 18, he has been involved in the Selecao set-up for five years and first made headlines when he scored 10 goals in seven matches at the Under 15 South American Championship.

His subsequent move from Vasco da Gama to Atletico Paranaense caused controversy as it is generally agreed that players under the age of 17 are not hawked around by agents.

KELECHI IHEANACHO (18, Nigeria Under 17 and Manchester City)

Tipped as the 'next big player' to come out of Africa, Iheanacho has already enjoyed some big moments in his career for club and country. 

The Nigerian hotshot was very impressive on Manchester City's pre-season tour of the United States, even scoring in the 4-1 win over Sporting Kansas City, having won a place on the flight to America by impressing during a training camp for the fringe players in Scotland. 

He has certainly caught the eye of Yaya Toure, who said: 'Kelechi is an exciting player. I love the way he plays and I feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future.' 

Internationally, he was the star of Nigeria's triumph at the 2013 Under 17 World Cup, scoring six goals and contributing seven assists as they lifted the trophy in the United Arab Emirates.

OLIVER TORRES (19, Spain U21 and Porto, on loan from Atletico Madrid)

Part of the Spain Under 21 squad that will take on Serbia for a place in next summer's European Championship over the coming weekend, forward-thinking midfielder Oliver stands out even in such a prodigiously talented group. 

Currently on loan at Porto - where he has scored once in three matches so far - from parent club Atletico Madrid, he is tipped for a very bright future.

Two-footed with exceptional passing and vision, Oliver has already featured in the Atletico first team and was a member of the Spain squad that won the 2012 European Under 19 Championship.

TIMO WERNER (18, Germany Under 19 and Stuttgart)

Known as the next Sami Khedira. Or is it Thomas Muller? Or perhaps Mesut Ozil? Whatever the comparison, Timo Werner is well on his way to fulfilling his huge potential for both club and country. 

At the start of last season it was obvious the forward had outgrown the youth team at Stuttgart and so, at the age of just 17 years, four months and 25 days - a club record - he lined up for the first team in a Europa League tie with Botev Plovdiv. 

He has since appeared regularly for Stuttgart, scoring four times.

Werner is also just the latest off the German production line as they try to retain their World Cup crown four years from now in Russia. He has been a regular scorer at every age level so far, notably the Under 17s, where he got 16 in 18 matches.

AGUSTIN ALLIONE (19, Argentina Under 20 and Palmeiras)

Very talented right winger who has been the subject of enquiries from Manchester City and Barcelona, on the recommendation of Lionel Messi, no less. 

The 19-year-old winger won't be coming to Europe just yet, however, having only recently signed for Brazilian club Palmeiras from Velez Sarsfield in his Argentine homeland. Allione is just 5ft 6.5in but makes up for his slight build with abundant skill and speed. 

He was part of the Velez squad that won the 2013 Argentinian championship and has represented his country at Under 17 and Under 20 levels.

BRUMA (19, Portugal Under 21 and Galatasaray)

Called up to the Portugal senior squad last October - in place of Cristiano Ronaldo no less - fleet-footed winger Bruma was being touted as a wildcard for Paulo Bento's squad at the World Cup. 

But then disaster struck and the Galatasaray man suffered a serious knee injury that not only ended his season but also any hope of being on the plane to Brazil.

It was particularly ill-timed as Bruma was also starting to make an impression for his club after joining from Sporting Lisbon the previous summer. No matter, the 19-year-old is back to full fitness and has plenty of time to fulfil his obvious potential.

NICOLA MURRU (19, Italy Under 21 and Cagliari)

Part of the Italy Under 21 squad that will play Slovakia in the European Championship play-offs this week, left back Murru seems destined for the big time.

The Cagliari talent has long been linked with a move to one of Italian football's leading lights, such as Juventus or Milan. He has come through the ranks at his hometown club and made his first-team debut back in December 2011. 

Murru is equally as capable with his defensive duties as with pushing forward as a flying wing back. Has just this year been promoted to the Azzurri Under 21 squad.

TONNY VILHENA (19, Holland Under 21 and Feyenoord)

It's a testament to  Vilhena's abilities that he has 74 appearances for Feyenoord under his belt and is still only 19. He is deployed by the Eredivisie side to perform both defensive and offensive duties and is very capable of doing both.

The left-footed teenager is a fine passer of the ball and packs a powerful shot too. Vilhena came through the youth ranks at the Rotterdam side and made his debut in January 2012.

His feats for the Oranje have been equally impressive, helping the Under 17 team to victory in the 2011 and 2012 European Championships.

FABRICE OLINGA (18, Cameroon and Apollon Limassol on loan from Malaga)

Still only 18, Olinga already holds a few significant records - he became La Liga's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days when he found the net for Malaga against Celta Vigo on the opening day of the 2012-2013 season. 

The striker is also Cameroon's youngest ever scorer after breaking the record of Samuel Eto'o on his debut against Cape Verde in October 2012. And he was an unused sub in his country's World Cup squad over the summer.

Comparisons with the great man have become part of the burden Olinga must bear and it doesn't help that he was spotted when at Eto'o's football academy back home.

It now remains to be seen how his career develops - Olinga is currently on loan with Apollon Limassol havign spent a bit of time in Belgium with Zulte Waregem last season. The game time can surely only help this big talent.

DIEGO FAGUNDEZ (19, Uruguay Under 20 and New England Revolution)

Usually, South American stars flourish at a club in their homeland before taking the well-trodden route to Europe for a megabucks sum. Not so Fagundez, whose family moved from Montevideo to Massachusetts when he was just five. 

Consequently, his talent has been nurtured in the United States and, more specifically, by MLS club New England Revolution, whom he joined at the age of 14.

Indeed, he was the first academy player the Revolution brought through when contracted in November 2010. Attacking midfielder Fagundez has an effective combination of acceleration, control and instinctive finishing that make him highly effective.
