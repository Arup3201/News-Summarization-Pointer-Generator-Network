A burn victim has gotten married in the hospital where she is being treated for her injuries.

Jennifer Johnson's wedding to Jimmie Smith had to be postponed for the second time after a cooking accident days before the ceremony left her with severe burns to her hand.

But  last Tuesday at Akron Children's Hospital she finally walked down the aisle, accompanied by 40 friends and family members and a nurse who carried the IV unit attached to her leg.

In sickness and in health: Rather than postpone her wedding after a horrific cooking accident, Jennifer Johnson married Jimmie Smith in the hospital where she was being treated for second and third degree burns

When asked why she didn't wait to be 
discharged from the hospital before tying the knot, the bride told Akron Beacon Journal: 'Do you see how 
many obstacles keep getting thrown in the way?'

She added: 'We've both recently been baptized and we live together. We don't want to live in sin anymore.'

Ms Johnson was frying cheese sticks in her Ohio home five days before her intended wedding day when the grease caught fire.

She instinctively carried the pan outside, but a draft from the open door caused the flames to flare, leaving her with second and third degree burns to her hand and forcing her to delay the ceremony.

Emotional day: The bride wipes a tear away as she is wheeled to the aisle by a nurse carrying her IV unit

Nothing stopping them now: The couple had already been forced to delay their nuptials once before in November, when Ms Johnson had to undergo a hysterectomy

But this was not the first time the couple had been required to postpone their nuptials.

They originally planned to wed in November, but the ceremony was cancelled after Ms Johnson had to undergo a hysterectomy.

She and her fiance were lamenting their failed 
attempts at getting married when a nurse overheard them and mentioned that the hospital had
a chapel.

Ms Johnson recalls: 'We looked at each other and smiled.'

In the brief ceremony, Ms Johnson walked down the hospital aisle carrying white and red 
carnations while the couple's friends and family members hummed the tune to Here Comes the Bride.

Wedding attire: The bride wore a red sleeveless dress since a bulky bridal gown would have interfered with her intravenous tubes and monitoring wires

Bad timing: Due to a cooking accident, Ms Johnson suffered second and third degree burns to her hand just five days before her intended wedding day

Maid of honor Andrea Milhoan explained that they didn't attempt to put a wedding gown on the bride since it would have interfered with her intravenous tubes and monitoring wires.

Instead, Ms Johnson wore a red sleeveless dress and a white veil, her injured right hand wrapped up to the elbow in gauze.

The Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio is one of only two burn centers in the United States that treat both adults and children.

A spokesperson said that while wedding ceremonies in children's hospitals are rare, there have been instances in the past where parents wanted to get married by a sick child's bedside.
