'Psychopath' burglars brutally clubbed nearly 1,000 chickens to death with golf clubs after breaking into an industrial farm in California's Central Valley, police have revealed.

Workers showed up at Foster Farms near Fresno on September 20 to find 920 chickens bludgeoned to death.

Detectives discovered a piece of a golf club that the burglars had left behind.

'Psychopathic behavior, it’s sick behavior. And people who will do this, it can definitely lead to other things,' Fresno County sheriff's deputy Chris Curtice told KPIX-TV.

Foster Farms said the birds were worth about $5,000. 

The company said it was furious about the cruelty to the chickens and have offered a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the suspects. 

'This appears to be a random act of violence. It is the express policy of Foster Farms to treat its birds humanely and with compassion. Any intentional act to the contrary is unacceptable,' the company said in a statement. 

Workers say they were horrified by the mess left  from the mutilated birds. 

'It’s crazy that someone would break into the chicken shed to kill them. It’s just crazy,' employee Antonio Puentes told KPIX.
