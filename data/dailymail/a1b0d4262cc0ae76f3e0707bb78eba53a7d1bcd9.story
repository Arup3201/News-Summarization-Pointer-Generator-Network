Travellers evicted from a park where they had been staying while attending a wedding have left locals with a clean-up bill of tens of thousands of pounds.

Huge quantities of mattresses, bedding, building material, wood and other construction waste was dumped in Bedford Wood Tooting Common.

Officials at Wandsworth Council in south west London branded the mess - just yards from where the travellers set up their unlawful camp - as 'an absolute disgrace'.

Costly: The bill to clear up this huge pile of rubbish left by travellers on Tooting Common, south west London, is expected to be tens of thousands of pounds

Threat: The group of travellers spent 48 hours on Tooting Common before leaving after Wandsworth Council threatened them with legal action

The group arrived in a fleet of 19 cars and caravans on Tuesday but left yesterday after the council told them they would face legal action if they remained.

The clean-up operation is expected to cost thousands of pounds.

Jonathan Cook, the council’s environment spokesman, said: 'What has been left behind on the common is an absolute disgrace.

Anger: Tons of debris, building waste and rubbish were dumped on Tooting Common - just yards from where a group of travellers set up this illegal camp

Disgrace: Wandsworth Council described the mess on Tooting Common as 'an absolute disgrace'

Dumping ground: Visitors to Tooting Common discovered mountains of building material and waste had been dumped

'The culprits have dumped tons of waste in what is a beautiful and much loved wood that exists for the benefit of the entire community.

'Those responsible for treating it as a rubbish dump are beyond the pale and should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.

'Fortunately we were able to remove this group from the common in relatively quick time and so make sure that no long-term damage was caused.'

Prevention: Council officials are now trying to secure Tooting Common to ensure the massive dumping of waste does not occure again

Mr Cook said the council was considering ways of stopping other travellers from moving on to the common.

'What we are now keen to do is work with the local community to explore acceptable ways of preventing this type of invasion in the future,' he said.

'At the moment it is just far too easy to drive onto the common from Bedford Hill so we are going to see if there are any reasonable and effective measures we can possibly introduce to prevent or deter this from happening again.

'And residents can rest assured that we will be working closely with the police to see if we have enough evidence to trace and prosecute those who’ve caused such awful damage to the common.'
