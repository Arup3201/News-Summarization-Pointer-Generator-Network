Seventy years after helping recover stolen art from the Nazis, Harry Ettlinger gets to see his story on the big screen

In the searing heat, some 700 feet deep in the bowels of the Kochendorf salt mine in Germany, Harry Ettlinger prised open one of the 40,000 mud-crusted crates stacked by the shaft.

Inside, piled high, were scores of paintings.

Haltingly, he unwrapped the first. Inside the packing paper, its vibrant colours glancing off the flickering light of his pit lamp, the distinctive features of Rembrandt gazed back.

Harry recognised it at once. Six years before, in 1938, as a 13 year old art lover in his native Karlsruhe in Germany, he had yearned to see the Dutch artist’s iconic self-portrait that hung in the town’s museum. But as a German Jew, ostracised and under threat, he wasn’t allowed inside the building. Now, in 1944 with war raging around him as the Allies routed the Nazis troops, Harry, who had fled Germany and was now an American GI, knew his discovery of the precious icon - one of five million art works looted by Hitler’s troops - would be saved for posterity.

In all, that one cache of stolen paintings contained 900 stolen works, among them the precious Stuppach Madonna, a medieval panel painting of the baby Jesus and Mary by German artist Grunewald. All had been stashed by Hitler’s troops after their rampage across Europe.

Their value was incalculable - one, alone, a self-portrait by Italian artist Raphael, is worth £60m today. All had been destined for Adolf Hitler, but even now with the Reich teetering, the fanatical Nazi leader had ordered the irreplaceable iconic works should all be destroyed.

In a few weeks time Harry, 88, who now lives in New Jersey and is one of the few remaining members of the Anglo-American Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section, will finally be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his bravery.

The highest award to a civilian for an act of heroism that contributed to America’s history, the medal will seal forever the brave and unflinching sacrifices he and his 350 colleagues made to ensure Hitler’s plan to destroy the majority of Europe’s priceless art works was foiled.

But it isn’t the only honour that Harry has received. George Clooney’s iconic film The Monuments Men, depicting the men’s heroic story, has now been released on DVD and Blue-ray. Directed by and starring Clooney, as well as a star-studded cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchette, it paints a vivid account of the heroism of the 400 or so art historians, museum directors and art curators - all more familiar with a Michaelangelo than a machine gun - who became entangled in a dramatic race against time in their bid to save some 1,000 years of culture.

Although he fled Germany just prior to WWII, he said it was not hard to take up arms against his home country

‘Watching the film was such a humbling experience,’ says Harry, a widower who has lived alone since his beloved wife Mimi died 10 years ago.

‘It brought the powerful message that, not only did Hitler want to annihilate an entire race, but he wanted its culture wiped from the face of the earth too.

‘I went back to the Kockendorf two years ago and memories came flooding back. It wasn’t hard for me to take arms against my home country. The day I left Germany I was no longer German.

'I have been an American citizen since I was 19 and I am an American patriot. I will never forget the bravery of the Men. Those British men, such as the Cambridge historian Ronald Balfour (played in The Monuments Men by Hugh Bonneville) who was killed by a shell burst while trying to rescue a medieval altar from a church in Cleves in Germany in March 1945.

'And American architect Walter Hutchthausen who was gunned down trying to rescue an altar piece near Aachen.’

The Monuments Men is based on Robert Edsel’s book charting the Men’s success. As a young man in Florence in 1996 Edsel began to wonder how many great masterpieces had survived WWII. His research into the Men’s unit became a labour of love.

When Clooney read his work he, too, became passionate about turning the incredible story into a film. These men, Clooney realised, had been air brushed from history.

‘George helped me to lobby for the medal to be awarded to the few remaining Men, such as Harry,’ Edsel says. ‘I had the honour of breaking the news of the award to Harry. He looked just like a child who had seen Santa Claus. He so deserves it.’

Harry and 
his parents and siblings were among the last German Jews who managed to 
escape Nazi Germany. His father, who helped run a women’s fashion store 
realised that soon the persecution would go far beyond merely his shop 
being boycotted.

The Monuments Men was released in February this year and features a star studded cast that includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett.

The film is based on the book 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and grossed almost £91 million at the box office.

It follows the team tasked with finding and saving thousand of important pieces of art and culture before the Nazis could destroy them at the end of the war.

Although it was called the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Program, George Clooney's character assembles a team to enter Europe in the hope to identifying, finding and saving the valuable artwork which is nicknamed 'The Monuments Men'.

Harry Ettlinger is played by British actor Dimitri Leonidas in the film, although the character is only loosely based on him and is renamed Sam Epstein.

Increasingly
 the family was ostracised and when neigbouring Germans made it clear 
the Ettlinger family was not wanted he moved swiftly.

Harry
 joined the American army at 19, becoming an infantry man. But his 
fluency in his native tongue meant he was asked to join the Monuments 
Men. In the film his story inspired the character of Sam Epstein, played
 by ex-Grange Hill actor, Dimitri Leonidis.

After the war Harry travelled back to Germany, hoping to find some of his own family’s art treasures which had been stored in a warehouse in Baden Baden.

He travelled with a Holocaust survivor and recalls: ‘When we found the warehouse, my grandfather’s art was there.

But our jeep broke down and we had to stay the night. We ended up in the top suite of the best hotel in town.

There we were, a Jewish soldier and a Holocaust survivor. Sleeping in a bed meant for the German kaiser. I’m proud of that.’

He had the family heirlooms shipped back to America and, today, one piece he saved is still displayed on the wall of his apartment: a print of that Rembrandt self portrait. ‘It reminds me of what we achieved and the sacrifices that people like my buddies made.

‘Sothebys offered me £500,000. But because of the proud memories it brings back it is beyond price to me.’
