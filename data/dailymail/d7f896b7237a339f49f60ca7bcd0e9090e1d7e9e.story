This is the moment a heroic 16-year-old rugby tackled a thug to the ground after seeing him attack two female police officers.

Kiya Ingham chased and restrained Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, after he violently assaulted two WPCs on a busy road in Brighton, East Sussex.

The keen kick boxer has now been given a top bravery award for assisting WPC Lynsey Burkinshaw and WPC Johanna Clarke and plans to become a police officer.

Kiya Ingham chased and restrained Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, after he assaulted two WPCs in Brighton

He said: 'I took interest at what was happening inside the police car and sat at the bus stop for about 30 seconds.

'Then the man flipped. I dropped my bag, which had my tablet and phone in, and ran after him. I didn't think, it was just instinct.

'When I was running I was just hoping I could get him down, because if he did that to police officers he could do worse to me.

'You can see him point at me and say 'I know your face'. 

The officers were speaking to Hughes  as Mr Ingham arrived at the bus stop after arresting him over a domestic incident in June

Hughes lunged at the officers as he forced his way out of their patrol car, with Mr Ingham sitting nearby

A bare-chested Hughes then escaped their grasp and began sprinting away from them

But after Mr Ingham tackled him, WPC Lynsey Burkinshaw and WPC Johanna Clarke were able to hold him down

'He was being aggressive and swearing at me, but then back-up arrived and he was taken away.'

The two policewomen had arrested Hughes over a domestic incident on June 10, but he kicked out after being put into the car and attempted to escape.

In the video he is shown shoving them out of the way and wrestling with them on the ground.

Hughes from Seaford has since been convicted after pleading guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer and received 100 hours community service.

Chief Superintendent Nev Kemp, Brighton and Hove Divisional Commander, said: 'Kiya acted heroically and I commend his bravery.

The keen kick-boxer has now been given a top police bravery award for assisting the WPCs

Speaking after he received his award, Mr Ingham said: 'You can see him point at me and say 'I know your face'

'I was delighted to recognise his actions with an award in our Brighton and Hove Divisional awards ceremony, attended by Katy Bourne the Police and Crime Commissioner earlier this year.

'Kiya received a huge cheer and round of applause from everybody at the event when the footage was shown.

'The incident shows how difficult and sometimes dangerous policing can be, so we were very grateful and moved that without hesitation he stepped into help the police in such a situation.

'I also want to pay tribute to the way in which the two officers quickly regained control of the situation, despite the violence that was directed towards them. I and my team here thank him for his courage and selfless public service which helped us bring an offender to justice.'
