If events on the pitch proved disappointing for the LA Galaxy fans, there was always the Beckham clan’s executive box to provide some entertainment.

Watching David in action were several members of his family, a minor royal, a Hollywood star and a Python.

Not to mention Stuart Pearce, assessing 37-year-old Beckham’s form before choosing the Great Britain football squad for the London Olympics.

On the front row are, from left, British- born actor Jim Piddock, who has appeared in movies including The Prestige; Prince Michael of Kent’s son Lord  Freddie Windsor; Monty Python star Eric Idle; Beckham’s sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn; and a member of the family entourage.

Behind them are the footballer’s mother Sandra and sister Joanne, and in the right corner a pensive Pearce. Beckham’s wife Victoria can be seen indoors, playing with nine-month-old daughter, Harper.

Before heading to the US, Pearce said there was no guarantee that the former England and Manchester United player would be selected.

He added: ‘I will pick solely on merit. I will know a bit more when I see what form Beckham is in.’

Sadly for the object of his attentions, pictured right, he failed to inspire Galaxy and they lost 1-0 to the New York Red Bulls.
