It has been perhaps the biggest phenomenon to ever hit the Internet, influencing everything from celebrity culture to politics to international 
relations.

But the site itself has changed little since launch - the Twitter team perhaps cautious of the criticism Facebook gets when it revamps a feature.

But today Twitter announced its biggest overhaul since its launch in 2006, in particular introducing a 'cover photo' to your user account, which will be seen by your followers whether they visit your page on the web, by mobile or by tablet.

The change brings Twitter a little closer to Facebook in terms of having a profile and a cover image, perhaps signalling Twitter's intent as it continues pushing forward.

Twitter is a cultural phenomenon, with more than 140 million users, 340 million tweets sent every day, and a valuation of $8bn.

However, it is still a David to Facebook's Goliath, which has a billion users, and a $100billion stock market flotation under its belt - indeed, the valuation went up by the same amount as Twitter's total value after a speech by Mark Zuckerberg last week.

But Twitter has taken the headlines over the last few years, adored by celebrities and their legions of fans.

With internet users migrating towards a more mobile environment, Twitter has also completely revamped its iPad and phone apps, bringing additional features to what were 
previously quite basic apps.

Founded: 2006

Number of users: 140million

Value: $8billion

Key founder: Jack Dorsey

Best known for: Short communications, celebrity updates, contact with companies

Founded: 2004

Number of users: ~one billion

Value: $100billion

Key founder: Mark Zuckerberg 

Best known for: Staying in touch with friends and family, sharing images

Experts say the firm is also trying to boost the number of people using its mobile apps following competition from third party apps such as Tweetbot.

'Twitter is trying to push people towards their mobile apps,' said Stuart Miles of web site Pocket Lint.

'Facebook has had cover pictures for a while, but Twitter has also had the ability to change your page - it's just not many people used it.'

New profile pictures: The iPad app has been 're-built' and will also support the new profile images

Announcing the changes on Twitter's blog, the team said: 'Starting today you can make your presence on Twitter more meaningful 
with new Twitter profiles.

'Upload an all-new header photo on mobile apps
for iPad, iPhone and Android or twitter.com, and the same image will 
appear whenever anyone views your profile on the web or these apps.

'You 
can upload your header photo, which appears above your Tweets, to 
express yourself instantly, anywhere.'

Other changes include photo streams that now appear below anyone’s most recent Tweets on 
iPhone, Android and iPad, which can be swiped through to see the photos of 
other users.

Celebrities such as Ryan Seacrest have already updated their profiles, having helped launched the changes on America's Today Show.

The new versions of the apps bring in the website-based changes, such as the header photos, and there are also more options for updating your profile.
