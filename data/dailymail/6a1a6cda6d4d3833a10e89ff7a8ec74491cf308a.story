Lies: Emma La Garde shaved her son's head and eyebrows to pretend he had cancer in a sick benefit fraud

A mother who shaved her son’s head 
and eyebrows to pretend he had cancer so she could claim benefits was 
sent to prison yesterday.

Emma La Garde, 37, made the 
seven-year-old use a wheelchair and shaved his head to mimic the effects
of chemotherapy in a scam that made her £86,000.

The boy, who cannot be named, was not
suffering from any illness but was forced to play along with his 
mother’s lies, wearing a bandana to school and not being allowed to take
part in PE lessons.

A court heard he hated being in the wheelchair and refused to use it at home, where he enjoyed playing on a trampoline.

Meanwhile his mother used her Facebook page to announce he had cancer and kept up the elaborate farce for four years.

La Garde used forged medical 
documents to enable her to earn money from a carer’s allowance, tax 
exemptions and disability benefits.

The mother of five, who was also 
given a specially-adapted car, used some of the money to pay for luxury 
holidays, including a trip to Disney World in Florida where she took her
son in his wheelchair so they could get to the front of the queues.

The court heard that the fraud started when she took her son to see a doctor in 2008 after he complained of pains in his legs.

Following tests, the doctor wrote to 
La Garde to say the boy’s blood tests were clear and that he was 
healthy. But she used the letter as a template to forge letters that 
said he was gravely ill.

At first she claimed he had ALPS – 
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome – causing an enlarged spleen. 
She sent it to his school and the Department of Work and Pensions to 
claim Disability Living Allowance. In 2009 she sent her son to school in
a wheelchair donated by the Red Cross and told teachers he could not do
physical education.

In February 2010, La Garde sent 
another forged doctor’s letter to the school claiming her son had 
lymphoma, a type of cancer. Lisa Hennessey, prosecuting, said: ‘She said
he would be treated with an oral tablet that would make his hair fall 
out.

'Within days he was wearing a bandana at school and La Garde told 
teachers that the other children should be stopped from pulling it off 
as they would make fun of him.

‘There was visible hair growth around
the edges of the bandana and it was obvious to the school that his 
eyebrows had been shaved off.

‘The person who had carried out this was Emma La Garde.’

La Garde’s deceit was uncovered when the boy’s father, from whom she had separated, was shown the faked letters at school.

The doctor confirmed his son’s clean 
bill of health, at which point the father contacted social services, and
La Garde was arrested in May 2010. She later admitted one charge of 
child cruelty, eight counts of fraud and one of forgery. Jailing her for
three years and eight months, Judge Jamie Tabor said she was a 
congenital liar.

‘What a tangled web you wove,’ he added. ‘This was cruelty over a long period of time.’

He
read out a victim statement for her son, who is now ten, which read: ‘I
don’t like her, she is evil. She should be normal but I don’t think she
has a normal brain. I know I don’t miss her any more.’

The judge said the boy did not want to see his mother, who has also lost custody of her other four children.

The total amount claimed by La Garde, who lives in Gloucestershire, was £85,899.44 over a four-year period.

Minutes
after she was taken to the cells at Gloucester Crown Court an ambulance
was called amid fears she had taken a drug overdose.
