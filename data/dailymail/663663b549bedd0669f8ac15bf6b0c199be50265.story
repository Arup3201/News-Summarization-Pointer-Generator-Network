Friends and family members have been posting about their sorrow over the death of the 2-year-old son of Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson.

Peterson did not know he was the father of the young boy until he was already in the hospital. The running back was away from training again on Wednesday as he presumably spends time with his grieving family.

The boy, whose name has been revealed to be Tyrese Robert Doohen, was raised by his mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen.

Tragic: Friends and relatives are posting pictures of Tyrese 'Ty' Doheen who died on Friday

Parents: The boy was raised by his mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen (left) in South Dakota and Adrian Peterson (right) did not even know that he was the boy's father until he took a paternity test several months ago

She reportedly lived with her boyfriend Joey Patterson and he now faces charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery.

Those charges will likely be increased to murder since the boy was taken off life support on Friday.

Ms Doohen has posted photos of Tyrese, who friends and family members called Ty, and has received an outpouring of support.

'Ann I haven't stopped thinking of you. My heart just aches. I am praying for you and your family,' her friend Sarah Powell wrote underneath a photo of the boy as a newborn.

Newborn: Ms Doohen posted this photo of Ty when he was first born, and friends have commented telling her that they are praying for her and keeping the 'angel' in their thoughts

Little guy: Ty, seen here watching football, lived with his mother and her boyfriend who has since been arrested and charged with aggravated battery though he may now face murder charges since the boy died

A number of her friends have posted more recent photos of the boy, where he is seen posing in sunglasses and watching football on television.

In one, a relative of Ms Doohen's posted a picture of Ty and a group of children at what looks to be a zoo, but the animal isn't capturing Ty's attention as he looks away from the group and up at someone outside of the photo.

'Always looking for his mom,' Celeste Zimmerman wrote.

Though he has changed dramatically between the time he was born and the more recent photos, he is always seen smiling and grinning.

Too short: The exact circumstances surrounding the boy's death are still unclear but are thought to be abuse

'He really is an Angel. My heart goes out to u sweetie, I will continue to pray for the Lord to mend your broken heart. I'm still in shock,' Jeannette Ruffin wrote.

Ms Ruffin appears to be a relative of Bobby Ruffin, who posted a rant on his Facebook page after Ty's death on Friday saying he was the person who raised the boy.

Sports fan: Since news of Ty's death, it has become clear that Peterson had a number of unknown love children

'So tired of this poor Adrian Peterson s**t. Let me blow all your minds,' Ruffin posted on his wall which was reported by TMZ.

'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried my name. Tyrese Robert Ruffin.

'I donâ€™t blame AP for not really caring cuz him and I both found out recently who the biological father was. AP met my son for the first time yest [sic] when my son was already in coma.

'I was here today when we pulled the plug, not him. He was happily practicing and has no problem playing on Sunday.'

Peterson has posted messages to his more than 900,000 followers on Twitter, thanking them for their support while clarifying the safety of one of his other sons, Adrian Peterson Jr.

'My son Adrian Jr. who lives w/me is healthy. Appreciate the concern. We respectfully ask to stop tweeting his pics.

'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players.'
