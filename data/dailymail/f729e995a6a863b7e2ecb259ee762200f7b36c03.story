The Ku Klux Klan is planning a rally in Memphis in protest at the city's decision to remove the name of one of its founding members from a public park.

A faction of the KKK called the 'Loyal White Knights' is angry that Nathan Bedford Forrest park has been renamed, and claims the move is part of a plan to 'erase white people from the history books.'

Bedford Forrest was a Confederate general during the American Civil War - and was thought to be the white supremacist organisation's first 'grand wizard.'

The group is calling on other branches of the KKK to join the rally on March 30.

Nathan Bedford Forrest Park has been temporarily renamed
 Health Sciences Park until a permanent name is selected, the Daily News reports.

The city's Confederate Park
 and Jefferson Davis Park - named after the former Confederate leader - were all also renamed by the city in February and are now called Memphis Park and Mississippi 
River Park, respectively.

Legacy: Nathan Bedford Forrest was a skillful Confederate cavalry commander during the Civil War - but was also an early member of the KKK

'They are renaming the park and also removing his remains,' the Loyal White Knights wrote on its website. 'We are asking all good klans to join us in the fight.

The group invited the Northern Mississippi White knights and International Keystone Knights to join it at the rally.

The North Carolina White Knight's self-titled 'imperial wizard' Chris Barker, said the decision to change the park's name was an attempt to 'erase white people from the history books,' the Daily News reports.

The rally will reportedly be held from 1.30 pm to 4pm outside Memphis's federal courthouse. Meanwhile the city council voted on Tuesday to ban the wearing of masks 'for the purpose of civil rights intimidation.'

Acccording to recent census figures the city's population is now more than 60 per cent black.
 The Memphis president of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP) has urged residents not to 'give the Klan an 
audience,' according to the Guardian.

The city council's decision is thought to have been influenced by a state bill that would ban the renaming of military or war memorial parks.

Bedford Forrest was a skillful cavalry and military commander during the Civil War, and one of the few men to enlist as a private and rise through the ranks to become a general.

He was less well educated than many of his fellow officers, but his innovative approach to military command was celebrated by his contemporaries.

However, his reputation was scarred after he was accused of war crimes at the Battle of Fort Pillow for allowing his forces to massacre upon hundreds of black Union Army and white Southern Unionist prisoners.

After the war he became an early member of the KKK which had been formed by veterans of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee in 1866.
