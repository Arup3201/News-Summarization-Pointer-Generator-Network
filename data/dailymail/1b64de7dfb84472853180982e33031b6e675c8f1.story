A three-year-old boy's parents were horrified when some of his first words were expletives they say he learned from a Peppa Pig toy.

Amari Black had been given the Peppa Pig Fun And Learn tablet as a present and parents Garfield and Marcha had hoped it would help their  son improve his speech.

But then they heard the boy utter 'f*** you', and realised he had picked it up from the malfunctioning £20 toy.

Amari Black's parents are horrified when some of the three-year-old's first words were 'f*** you', which they say he picked up from this Peppa Pig toy

Painter and decorator Mr Black, 48, noticed that instead of saying 'find the odd one out', the toy says 'f**k you? odd one out'. 

'I was cooking in the kitchen when I heard him saying 'f*** you,' he said.

'I was disgusted, I thought he had learned it at nursery.

'But then when I was playing with him I realised that it was Peppa Pig that was teaching him it - I was very upset.

'I was going to destroy it, that's how angry I was.

'Now he's saying it constantly and he finds it funny. I tell him swearing is wrong but he keeps saying it now.'

The toy was bought as a Christmas present for Amari by a family friend from Argos and is said to be suitable for children three and above.

Amari was was born with rickets and has learning difficulties so his parents hoped the toy would help him improve his speech. 

'We want our kids to be happy - so we work hard to buy these things for our kids but they just go and teach them how to swear.' said Mr Black, who believes the foul language is down to a malfunction in the toy.

'He can say "mum", "dad", "please", "thank you", and sadly "f**k you".

'We've been buying Peppa Pig toys for our kids for years but will never buy them again.'

Job centre advisor Mrs Black, 34, said she was shocked when relatives questioned whether Amari had learned the swear word from his parents.   

'I'm devastated. He got in trouble at my mum's for saying it and told me off because she thought he was learning it from us at home,' she said.

'He's definitely banned from playing with it now.

'We would never use that language at all, let alone in front of an impressionable child.

'I want to encourage him to talk as much as possible, but it's hard because whenever I tell him he's doing well, he responds with 'f*** you'.'

Mother-of-four Marcha says she has written two emails of complaint to manufacturers InspirationWorks, but is yet to hear back.

She said: 'I feel devastated and let down by them.'

InspirationWorks is yet to comment on the family's claims.
