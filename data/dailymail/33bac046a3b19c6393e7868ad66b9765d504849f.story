Massimo Moratti has resigned as honorary president of Inter Milan after nearly 20 years at the Serie A club.

Moratti, who was Inter president for 18 years, was handed the honorary title last year after completing a majority share sale to Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir.

A statement by his company on Thursday said Moratti has stepped down from the position 'kindly offered to him by Erick Thohir in November last year'.

His son Angelomario Moratti, who was vice-president, has also resigned, along with board members Rinaldo Ghelfi and Alberto Manzonetto.

Recent reports have said Moratti and Thohir were divided on the future of club coach Walter Mazzarri.

Moratti's company still has a 29.5 per cent stake in Inter.
