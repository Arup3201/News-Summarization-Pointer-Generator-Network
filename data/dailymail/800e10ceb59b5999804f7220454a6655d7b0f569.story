A man who used to live off takeaways and frequented his local pub on a daily basis has totally transformed his life and his physique by taking up body building.

As the oldest surviving male in his family, having lost many relatives to cancer, Carl Class, 48, from Stafford, was already aware of his health and became determined to make a change as he approached his 40th birthday.

The father-of-three now works out every day and has even started a new career as a personal trainer.

‘As I approach my 48th birthday in a few weeks’ time, I feel stronger fitter healthier and happier than ever before in my life.

‘As cancer surrounds my family, I decided at 40 years old to change my lifestyle completely.

‘I stopped going to the pub every night and instead starting going back to the gym, cutting down on my alcohol intake.

‘It was hard at first but I soon got the bug for it and began changing my life and well being.’

Until he was 40, Carl worked in the construction industry, going to the pub every day as well as living off fast food in the form of takeaways – eating at chip shops and the local Chinese every week.

Although never overweight, Carl was unfit, unhealthy and un-toned.

Guinness lover Carl used to visit the pub most days and lived off a diet of chips and takeaways

He used to snack on anything sweet, such as chocolate, sweets and crisps, as well as drinking pints of Guinness daily.

Carl
 initially began just to workout, making few changes to his diet, but soon 
realised he needed to make drastic changes to his food intake to see 
real improvements in his well being.

Having lost many family members to cancer, Carl was becoming increasingly aware of his health as he approached 40

‘I
 trained to do a triathlon for over 18 months but this made me feel too 
slim and cut my muscles away, so I changed my plan. After spending the 
next three years working abroad and trying to go the gym daily I started
 to see muscle growth and developments.

‘I
 soon realised that food is as important if not more important than 
anything you do in the Gym, as no great body has been achieved without a
 healthy lifestyle.’

Since
 he has started his new regime Carl has cut out all bread, and swapped 
any white carbs for brown, choosing a wholemeal alternative when 
possible and exchanging potatoes for sweet potatoes.

An
 average day now might start with a breakfast of eggs and porridge 
followed by chicken salad for lunch and fish with sweet potatoes and 
vegetables for dinner.

He
 has ditched the Guinness and now makes a juice mix in the morning that 
he drinks over the course of the day which includes celery, cucumber, 
beetroot, rhubarb, apple, pear, banana, pineapple, avocado, protein 
powder, peanut butter and honey.

‘After
 changing the way I thought about food and supplements my body began to 
change slowly but surely. After three years of consistent training and good 
eating I’m now a different man with a totally different body, my whole 
body skin and face look healthier younger and fitter.

‘My
 whole life has changed for the better, I can deal with problems, I’m 
more positive, stronger and very much contented with where I am now.’

As well as transforming how he feels, Carl has gained a new career through his new found love of exercise.

As well as totally changing his body and health, Carl has begun a new career as a personal trainer

‘I currently work as a full time personal trainer with 15-20 regular clients and two separate classes.

‘I have a lot of clients who are over 40 and I have inspired them to get into great shape also.

‘The gym is now a part of my life I could not do without, it has helped me get rid of depression and anxiety. I’ve passed this on to my clients, and they can’t believe the difference.

‘I also work with the elderly and over 80’s and seeing these people made me realise how important it is to keep your body flexible and mobile.

‘We are still very capable of performing and keeping a body in great shape no matter how old we are, my fitness and capabilities have gone from strength to strength.

‘I believe that everyone over 40 should try and change their lifestyle to include the gym and a healthy lifestyle, giving them a better quality and longer life expectancy.’

Carl is not alone in discovering fitness later in life.

A survey commissioned by sports nutrition supplier Bodybuilding Warehouse of over 2,000 people has shown that MAMILS (middle aged men in lycra) are the fastest growing age group to have taken up bodybuilding over the past 12 months, with them representing more than one in ten of the nation's bodybuilders.
