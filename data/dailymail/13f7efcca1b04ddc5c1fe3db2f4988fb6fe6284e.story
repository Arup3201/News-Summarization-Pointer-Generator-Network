My husband and I recently had a five-star holiday from hell.

There we were, surrounded by serene, white sanded beaches, on a glamorous and remote beach resort teeming with A-list amenities, but utterly stressed out and miserable.

How did this happen? Easy. It was the cataclysmic combination of a teething, jet lagged, overly excited one-year-old jumping around in the lap of five-star luxury.

Ashley says that when it comes to holidays with the kids you have to be prepared

To be frank, it's all my fault. My rookie mistake was neglecting to realise that the former holidays my husband and I looked forward to needed to be adapted for this new addition to our lives.

Luxe and babies don't always mix, to say the least. And from the beginning I made several key mistakes.

Ashley shares her top tips on how to have a stress-free holiday with an infant

For example, as a Londoner, constant sunshine may be your most longed-for companion, but as a mum, it's your mortal enemy. 

Steep terrain represents a great way to work off breakfast but a horrible obstacle course for a newly walking baby. 

And long distances from an airport can be a relaxing opportunity to soak up local colour when alone, but alongside a baby who hates her car seat, I can promise you, it's a quick trip to hell. 

Our biggest problem however, was the resort itself. The venue was completely unsuitable. Marble floors and pure white interiors do not a baby-friendly vacation make.

Unforgiving edges and sedate and elegant restaurants were the stuff of nightmares when combined with a one-year-old. And believe me, I am well aware from my single years that just because I love being around my baby, I do not assume that others feel the same. 

After careful research, and in an effort to correct my unfortunate errors, we recently took one more trip - this time with a lot more forethought and care. And happily, I discovered that with the right planning, babies and luxe holidays can in fact find a way to happily co-exist.

The first thing I did was shift gears regarding the location. 

I began looking at villas to rent rather than hotel rooms. We were delighted to find a stunning five-bedroom property in Kalkan, Turkey, called Kalamar Dream. This place was divine.

Sea views from every room, a games room, huge terraces for BBQs and laying out and a gorgeous infinity pool. Set up with children in mind, the villa also came with a high chair, baby cot, safety gates, and a walker. 

This time, we travelled with extended family which meant more babysitters – bonus! Plus there were no more worries about our frequently loud dinner companion annoying nearby diners. From £220 per night. For bookings call 0788 082 3393

Operation Keep It Familiar. I have learned the hard way that babies don't love change. Time zones are unavoidable, and whist new places, new faces, appeal initially, frequently we were faced with grouchiness when routines and locations shifted dramatically. 

Baby Bjorn's travel cots are incredibly lightweight making them perfect for holidays

This time I packed smarter and included her own bedding. Baby Bjorn, famous for their carriers makes a gorgeous new travel cot, The Travel Cot Light, £199.99. There are no loose parts or complicated assembly and it's high quality, safe and also easy to carry on a plane. It made for a good sleep away from home.

Car equals prison. At least that's how our baby seems to view it. I am openly envious of all my friends who report that their baby just loves long drives in the car. 

What helped us was a Brittax car seat which is one of the safest (five-point safety harness) but allows her to sit up and see a bit more around her.

Ashley loves the KING II LS car seat which has a light that appears when you've reached the correct strap tension for the baby, making sure it's never too tight or loose

I loved the KING II LS, which has a light that appears when you've reached the correct strap tension for the baby, making sure it's never too tight or loose. Suitable for children aged nine months to four years old/ 9kg-18kg, and costs £170.

I will never again travel without a pushchair that she likes. We have been using Nuna's IVVI after I spotted Gwen Stefani using the same and decided to check it out.

It's a sleek, stylish option and looks far more expensive than it is. Baby loves it as it's a smooth ride and I loved that it folds up without taking the seat off.

It also stands on its own when folded (a plus behind doors), has great suspension and good on uneven roads. It costs £600 from www.shopnuna.co.uk.

Ashley got pram envy when she saw Gwen Stefani with this pushchair and had to try it out

Planes and cars demand distractions. I have learned to pack a bag specifically with toys, a bottle and snacks just for the trip.

The LeapPad Ultra is designed for four- to nine-year-olds but I discovered even my one-year-old loves it. Games, ebooks, music are all loaded but I loved that it has an adult content filter on their wifi (powered by Zui) which means the web is the kid-friendly environment they deserve. 

Parents can then rest assured that every web-based content experience is safe and age-appropriate. Try the new Frozen app which I'm pretty sure will do the trick. LeapPad Ultra £89.99 is available in major retailers, including Argos and Amazon.

Let someone else do the work for you. In addition to the villa, we stayed at Hillside Beach Club. It was recently named the best resort in Turkey for families, so we figured we were on the right track. 

Set on a stunning bay in Fethiye, this stylish, yet fun, hotel has some of the prettiest views I've ever seen. 

It's all-inclusive and the buffet area is boisterous with utterly fantastic food on offer, including a 'baby chef' who makes bespoke food for tots, with disposable bibs available at every meal. 

The kids' clubs were heavenly: a private and shaded pool, a bouncy castle for little ones and basketball court, water polo, Jacuzzi and Xbox for pre-teens.

Ashley says that the Hillside Beach Club offers great facilities to babies, children, teenagers and adults

They also look after grown ups: a Balinese-inspired spa – with a soothing massage up in a treehouse - a beachside disco, and two adult-only beaches.

They also have a Beach Order App which allows you to order cocktails from your loungechair.  Margarita and Aptamil on umbrella 7. Heaven.

A FEW GADGETS 

Diono Solar Eclipse Sun Shade (£16) offers fantastic sun and heat protection in the car. It attaches to any window and offers two levels of sun protection, the first reducing glare and filtering UV rays and the second acting as a black-out shade which blocks all sunlight and reduces heat. It was much better than moving the car seat from side to side during long drives which we were doing previously.  

Nap time is tricky on holiday but SnoozeShade was a hero. It's a breathable sleep and sun shade that gives high UV protection and keeps wind, chill, light rain and insects at bay whilst out and about in the buggy. It's also nice and dark inside. Starting from £19.99.

The stow n Go makes travelling with a baby less of a handful

Created by ENT specialists, Swimseal stops trapped water getting in baby's ears in the pool and can help prevent ear infections. It's all natural and can be used on babies from 6 months onwards. £7.99 from Superdrug.

I also loved the Diono Stow n Go, an organiser which hooks over the car seat in front of baby and has seven pockets and two drink holders in a washable and waterproof fabric. Perfect for hoarding all the bribery implements required. £13.00, available from Kiddicare 

And Holiday Must Haves for Mum: No list would be complete without something for the beleaguered baby's travel companion.

Edward James salons in Clapham and Putney do a British Blow Out, great for pre-holiday grooming

MY TOP TIPS

Edward James salons in Clapham and Putney do a British Blow Out. It's his version of the Brazilian blow out better suited to those of us with finer hair than our South American friends.

It costs around £100 and will give you a glossy, smoothed look throughout your holiday, during when you will almost certainly never, ever find time to blow dry your hair.

Linda Meredith's Travel Oxygen Masks. Kelly Brook had one on earlier this week but fans of LM's brand include Kate Moss, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Stella McCartney – all frequent fliers.

Her new portable O2 masks are skinny to pack, can go in a carry on and you can move around easily while they're on – no laying still necessary. 

Linda Meredith's oxygen masks are popular with celebs like Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Moss

Ashley wouldn't be without her Kindle on holiday and it saves extra room in the case for souvenirs!

I love how they take my dried up airplane face and make it look like I've just had a facial. Costs £119. Don't leave home without them. 

Kindle Paperwhite. If you still haven't bit the bullet and bought an ereader, maybe now's the time. So much lighter than carting around books, back lit so you can read in the hotel room without the need of a night light, battery last for weeks, can read with one hand and no screen glare in the sunshine.

I especially love the fact that if you become exasperated by the book you're reading you're certainly not stuck with it for the rest of the holiday £169 on Amazon.co.uk.

Babies add love and laughter to everything, but I've learned the hard way that holidays are a lot more fun for mum and dad than little ones who love routine.

Turning a holiday from hell into a spectacular getaway has less to do with a price tag and everything to do with gaining a clear picture of what every family member, even the littlest one, is looking for in a holiday experience.
