He may have got a standing ovation inside, but Bill Cosby was ridiculed leaving his first show November on Wednesday night, as scores of protesters braved below-freezing conditions to shame the besieged comedian. 

Cosby's show in Kitchener was the first of three performances planned in Canada's Ontario province and came in the wake of sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women.

As he was leaving the Centre In The Square Theatre following the performance - for which seated fans got to their feet to applause -  a heckler approached Cosby, who was well-guarded by security and other entourage members.

'Congratulations on your first show of 2015. Talk about starting the year with a bang! We hope it was consensual, Billy!,' the man can be heard shouting out in a video captured by NBC.

Taking to the stage: Cosby was performing his first show since November, after a spate of rape allegations were leveled against him

The entertainer saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour.

Wearing a sweater saying 'hello friend,' Cosby climbed the stage decorated with two giant posters of himself with Nelson Mandela. 

Some in the audience gave loud whoops but the reception was subdued compared to the standing ovation at his last stage performance in Florida.

'First of all thank you,' Cosby said to the audience before starting his routine with some cold weather jokes.

There were no disruptions during the performance and the crowd laughed throughout.

'I had a wonderful time,' Cosby said before leaving to a standing ovation.

However some ticket-holders had said they would boycott the performance, and the 2,000-seat venue was about two-thirds full. 

Several police officers and private security guards were posted throughout.

Outside the Centre in the Square, more than a dozen protesters came out in sub-freezing temperatures, carrying signs saying 'rape is no joke.' 

Some shouted 'you support rape' and 'shame on you' at fans.

A few protesters blocked the doors of the venue until being asked to leave by security.

But fans defended Cosby as they arrived.

'I'm skeptical of all the accusations,' said Gerald Reinink. 

'I always loved Cosby, good family humor. Why are 20 women coming out now when it's 20, 30 years ago?'

Dan Emerson said he was glad there were no hecklers inside the venue.

'Innocent until proven guilty. I'm hope it's not true and until I know otherwise I love him to death,' Emerson said.

Cosby, 77, is also scheduled to appear at the Budweiser Gardens in London on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton on Friday.

The comedian, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show' from 1984 to 1992, earning a reputation as 'America's Dad,' has never been charged in connection with any of the sexual assault allegations.

A 2005 lawsuit by a Pennsylvania woman was settled before it went to trial, and he is being sued by a woman who claims he molested her in 1974 and by three other women who allege they were defamed by the comedian when his representatives denied some of the allegations.

Most of the women say he drugged them before he assaulted them.

Hours before Cosby took the stage, attorney Gloria Allred said three more women are accusing the comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting them in Las Vegas or Los Angeles between 1981 and 1996. 

Allred said at a news conference in Los Angeles that the accusations are too old for criminal charges or lawsuits.

Phylicia Rashad, who played Cliff Huxtable's wife Claire on the Cosby Show, defended her co-star in an interview Wednesday with ABC World News Tonight. 

Rashad said she believed the allegations are part of a campaign to ruin Cosby's legacy.

'He's a genius. He is generous, he's kind, he's inclusive,' said Rashad, who first spoke to Roger Friedman earlier this week for his Showbiz911 blog. 

'This is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.'
