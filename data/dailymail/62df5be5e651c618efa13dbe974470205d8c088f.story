Children know the difference between right and wrong before they reach the age of two, according to new research published today.

Scientists have found that babies aged between 19 and 21 months understand fairness and can apply it in different situations.

They say it is the first time that having a sense of fairness has been identified in children at such a young age.

Researchers say babies will watch a scene for longer if they think it contains something unfair, so in two experiments the tots were timed on how long they watched a live scenario about fairness.

In the first, 19-month-olds saw two giraffe puppets given either a toy each or both toys to one of the giraffes.

Longer looking times indicated that something was odd or unexpected 
to the baby. In this experiment, three-quarters of the infants looked 
longer when one giraffe got both toys.

In a second experiment, two women faced each other with a pile of 
small toys between them and an empty plastic box in front of each of 
them.

In one scenario, one woman dutifully put the toys away, while the 
other kept playing, but both women were given rewards. In another 
scenario, both women put the toys away and both got a reward.

The watching 21-month-old infants looked reliably longer when the worker and the slacker were rewarded equally.

Psychologist Stephanie Sloane, who led the study at Illinois 
University, said: 'We found that 19 and 21-month-old infants have a 
general expectation of fairness, and they can apply it appropriately to 
different situations.

'We think children are born with a skeleton of general expectations 
about fairness and these principles and concepts get shaped in different
ways depending on the culture and the environment they’re brought up 
in.

'Helping children behave more morally may not be as hard as it would be if they didn’t have that skeleton of expectations.'

This innate moral sense might also explain the power of early trauma, Miss Sloane said.

Aside from fairness, research has shown that small children expect people not to harm others and to help others in distress.

She said: 'If they witness events that violate those expectations in 
extreme ways, it could explain why these events have such negative and 
enduring consequences.'

The findings appear in Psychological Science, a journal published by the Association for Psychological Science.
