They're often derided for being a less than healthy accompaniment to our favourite foods.

But a father and son in Belgium won't hear a word said against the humble chip - they've created the world's first museum dedicated to fries.

The Frietmuseum in Bruges offers chip lovers an educational insight into one of Belgium's national speciality foods.

It charts the history of the potato, which originated in Peru and the Belgian production of frites.

The museum, opened by Eddy Van Belle and hi son Cidric, is housed in the oldest building in Bruges - the 14th century gothic Saaihaile.

Eddy said: 'Over the years, fries have
become known world wide and enjoyed by adults and children in 
practically all countries and we so can be proud that they actually 
originate from Belgium.

'This is why it is not only normal, but absolutely necessary that the first potato fry museum should be opened in Belgium.'

Potatoes, chips and the various condiments which can be enjoyed with them including Belgian favourite mayonnaise are all celebrated in the quirky museum, which is spread over two floors.

All of the rooms are painted a nice chip-coloured yellow and the museum shows off a range of exhibits including ancient potato cutters and a video which shows the process of turning a potato into a chip.

There are no prizes for guessing what is on the menu in the museum's restaurant - chips.

The Van Belles are not the only food enthusiasts in the world to pay homage to their favourite meal by opening up a dedicated museum.

Florida man Harry Sperl turned his home into a museum dedicated to hamburgers.

'Hamburger Harry' filled his Daytona Beach home with 1,000 souvenirs based on his favourite food that he took around 23 years collecting.

Tasty: Chips

Belgians lay claim to the humble chip, though there is an ongoing dispute between the nation and France over its origin.

Belgian journalist Jo Gerard claims that the method of deep frying potatoes was used in the Spanish Netherlands (modern belgium) before 1860, citing a 1781 family manuscript.

Gerard has never produced the manuscript.

Regardless of which country invented chips, it is likely that the potato did not arrive in the area until around 1735.

The food is often attributed to the French - they are called French Fries after all - with Americans citing a notation from Thomas Jefferson between 1801 and 1809 which refers to Pommes de terre frites a cru, en petites tranches (potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings).

From 1813 onwards, recipes for what could be described as French fries began appearing in American cookbooks.

Some also believe that the chip may have originated in Spain - the first European country that the potato appeared in via the New World colonies.
