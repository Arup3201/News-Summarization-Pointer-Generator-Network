These stunning images could be mistaken for a cheetah ravenously chasing down a dog, but in fact, the pair playing in the snow at an Ohio zoo are best of friends.

Savanah, the one-and-a-half-year-old cheetah and Max, a Labrador who is just a few weeks younger, were put together when Savanah was just ten-weeks-old.

The adorable footage shows Savanah and Max playfully chasing after each other in an enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo.

BFFs: Savanah and Max wasted no time when the first snow fell, and just like young children were very excitable and wasted no time playing in the snow

Ever since, their friendship has amazed visitors at Cincinatti Zoo, who are delighted but confused as to why the spotted beast hasn't eaten the dashing hound.

In the video Savanah is seen chasing Max around an enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo and pouncing on him in some bushes.

The exuberant Labrador appeared to have more energy than his cheetah friend and, as Savanah caught her breath, he leaped through the air and into her, before the pair tore off again.

Max is part of a program that uses companion dogs to give cheetahs born in captivity more confidence.

Many of the cheetahs living in 
captivity find it hard to relate to other big cats, and safari parks 
were struggling with breeding programs for the endangered species.

But when San Diego Zoo started pairing the big cats with dogs about 30 years ago it marked the start of a beautiful friendship.

'The
 dog always has the cat's back, but it's never the other way around. 
Dogs worry about their cats. They protect their cats,' Janet 
Rose-Hinostroza, of San Diego Zoo, told NBC.

In Cincinnati Zoo, Savanah and Max have been inseparable since being introduced as youngsters last year.

While they have plenty of play time together, they are fed separately and Max also has play dates with other dogs and humans.

Surveying her territory, Savanah has taken to both the zoo and Max and delights visitors by chasing poor Max around the enclosure
