Itâ€™s official: money can indeed buy happiness - but you don't need to be anywhere near a millionaire to be content in life, finds a new study.

CNN Money's recent American Dream Poll found that just over half of its 1,000 people surveyed said that an annual income of under $100,000 would be enough to make them 'happy.'

Ten per cent of those questioned said they would be happy earning under $30,000, and only six percent staunchly stated that 'money can't buy happiness.'

Happy days: A new survey has found that 51per cent of those polled said an annual income of under $100,000 would be enough to make them happy, while a quarter would settle for $50-75,000

Apparently then, most of us agree that the amount cash we have to throw around does make a difference to our happiness in life.

Nearly a quarter of those polled were happy to settle with between $50,000 - which is the average American's household income, according to the latest census data - and $75,000 a year.

And this quarter may be on to something.

A separate study on close to half a million people, conducted by Princeton University in 2010, found that our 'happiness' does rise in line with how much money we are making, but only up to an annual income of about $75,000.

After that, higher incomes certainly buy 'life satisfaction' - leading people to view their lives as a whole in high regard - but it doesn't buy happiness, which was quantified more on people's day-to-day emotional well-being.

That study did concede that the inevitable trials and tribulations of being less fortunate does cause people to feel both unsatisfied by their lives, and unhappy emotionally.

According to U.S. census data, 'poor' is defined as a four-person family living on under $23,000 annually, which includes around $46.2 million Americans.

And what do the respondents of CNN's American Dream poll quantify as being wealthy?

Sixty per cent would call themselves 'rich' earning under $250,000 annually, and the most typical answers fell between $100,000 and $200,000. Eleven percent said they'd need over $1 million to truly call themselves rich.

In summary then, perhaps Woody Allen had it right when he once said: 'Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.'
