He may be blind, mute and have just three legs, but True the dog has been hailed a hero after saving a mother and baby from a house fire.

The seven-month-old disabled dachshund rewarded the Crosley family for their care when he detected a fire at their home in Grady County, Oklahoma, and barked and scratched at the door until the family woke up.

The fire, caused by an electrical fault, ignited a 'wall of flames' at the Crosley's cabin in Grady County, and ended up destroying the home and their belongings - including all of their baby supplies.

But Katie and her baby son Jace - who was born with a heart defect - are just happy to be alive following the blaze last weekend.

Jace, who was born with a heart condition, owes his life to True, who barked and scratched until the family woke up

The mother-of-one told KFOR-TV that she was sleeping heavily when the blaze broke out, but she was woken by True's barking.

She said: 'I thought he had to go outside. When I opened the door, it was a wall of flames.

'By the time I was out of the back door, all the windows had busted out and there were flames in every room.

'We lost everything, nothing is salvagable.'

Katie said she grabbed Jace and ran through thick smoke to escape out the back of the property.

With the family safe, Katie's biggest sadness is losing the toys, belongings and photographs from Jace's first year, as well as his medical records and her mother's antiques.

She said: 'That’s the hardest part, having all that stuff from when he was little.'

But she has nothing but praise for True, the dog that rewarded her kindness by saving her and infant's life.

She said: 'We’re thankful for him. This could have been a bad deal.'
