Oil giant BP is to pay the biggest fine in US history after agreeing a $4.5billion (£2.8billion) settlement with authorities for claims relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

BP will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to the oil rig accident in 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said: 'We apologise for our role in the accident and as today's resolution with the US government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for our actions.'

Under the deal, BP has pleaded guilty
to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect and three misdemeanour 
counts - including one under the Clean Water Act and one for obstructing
Congress.

The record-breaking fine surpasses 
even the $1.3billion (£820 million) fine paid by drugs group 
Pfizer in 2009 for marketing fraud related to a pain medicine.

BP will pay $4billion dollars (£2.5billion) to the DoJ in installments over five years.

It will pay an additional $525million (£331million) to the SEC over a period of three years.
BP will make the first payment of $175million (£110million) this year to the SEC.

The group has already paid out more than $38billion (£24billion) relating to the oil spill.

BP is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the overall impact on the Gulf Coast is still not known by researchers.

Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days before it was finally capped.

Some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick, about the area of Oklahoma.

More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill.

Many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil, as well.

The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf.

Mr Dudley said: 'All of us at BP 
deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon 
accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region.'

He added: 'Since the spill, we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company.

'We take seriously not only our 
commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our 
communications with stakeholders, including the public, the government 
and our investors.'

Today's settlement removes some of 
the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster, but it does 
not cover outstanding civil claims against the group.

BP said it will 'continue to vigorously defend itself' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence.

'We are open to settlements, but only on reasonable terms,' said Mr Dudley.

The deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that BP faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four Gulf Coast states in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.

BP still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by U.S. Gulf Coast states and other private plaintiffs.

It is unclear what form of criminal misconduct BP will plead guilty to. In an August filing, the Department of Justice said 'reckless management' of the Macondo well 'constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct,' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in New Orleans in February 2013.

The U.S. government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case.

It is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the Justice Department. It is also unclear how large a financial penalty BP might pay to resolve the charges, or other punishments that BP might face.

Negligence is a central issue to BP's potential liability. A gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by BP under the Clean Water Act to $21billion in a straight-line calculation.

According to the Justice Department, errors made by BP and Swiss-based Transocean Ltd, owner of the Deepwater Horizon platform, in deciphering a key pressure test of the Macondo well are a clear indication of gross negligence.

'That such a simple, yet fundamental and safety-critical test could have been so stunningly, blindingly botched in so many ways, by so many people, demonstrates gross negligence,' the government said in its August filing.

The mile-deep Macondo well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days.

The torrent fouled shorelines from Texas to Florida and eclipsed in severity the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska.

After several failed attempts, BP finally capped the well on July 15, 2010, halting the flow of oil after more than 85 days and putting a stop to what became one of the most closely watched shows on TV and the Internet: the live spill-camera image of the gushing well.

Nelda Winslette’s grandson Adam Weise of Yorktown, Texas, was killed in the blast. She said somebody needs to be held accountable.

'It just bothers me so bad when I see the commercials on TV and they brag about how the Gulf is back, but they never say anything about the 11 lives that were lost. They want us to forget about it, but they don’t know what they’ve done to the families that lost someone,' she said.

The spill exposed lax government oversight and led to a temporary ban on deepwater drilling while officials and the oil industry studied the risks, worked to make it safer and developed better disaster plans.

BP’s environmentally-friendly image was tarnished, and BP CEO Tony Hayward stepped down after the company’s repeated gaffes, including his statement at the height of the crisis: 'I’d like my life back.'

BP has already announced an uncapped class-action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill.
