A family of an 82-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer was outraged after he was forced to wait three hours outside a hospital in an ambulance.

Norma Leake from Penarth called for an ambulance after her husband Raymond, who is unsteady on his feet, fell in the shower and damaged his shoulder.

An ambulance took him to the University Hospital of Wales at 9.30am, but he was still waiting outside accident and emergency in an ambulance at 1.15pm, three hours later.

Deadly: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is one of those with high death rates

A source from the hospital, who asked not to be named, reported seeing 12 ambulances waiting outside the accident and emergency ward at 3pm, a couple of hours after Mr Leake was dropped off.

The family were outraged after they had seen their elderly and ill father wait for a number of hours to receive treatment.

Mr Leake's son Andrew, 57, from Chester, said: 'It is unbelievable that, in this day and age, we treat old people like that.

'I am really angry about the situation. Is this really the way our country treats its senior citizens?'

The hospital responded by highlighting the busy conditions of the hospital at the time.

They said the emergency unit was experiencing significantly a high number of calls, and so they were unable to help as quickly as they would have liked.

They also pointed out that large numbers of call outs, combined with many people walking in to A&E to receive treatment, had clogged up the emergency ward.

The University Hospital said they were experiencing unusually high numbers of calls at the time of Mr Leake's hospital visit

Alice Casey, chief operating officer for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'The Emergency Unit at UHW has been under significant pressure over the last few days.

'Staff have been caring for a high volume of acutely ill people brought in by ambulance coupled with large numbers of members of the public self-referring for treatment.

'This has impacted on the flow of patients through the hospital system and meant delays for a number of people for which we apologise.'
