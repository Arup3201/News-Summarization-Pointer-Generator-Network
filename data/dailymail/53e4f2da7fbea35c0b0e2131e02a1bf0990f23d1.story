Upset: Nail technician Carissa Grice used a mobile to check Facebook while abroad and was handed a bill for £3,000

A teenager who wanted to stay in touch with friends on Facebook while on holiday was left 'devastated' after she was sent a shock bill for almost £3,000.

Carissa Grice, 18, used the Orange mobile, which is in her mother Ellen's name, while they were on a fortnight's break together in Antalya, Turkey.

The teenager, from Greater Manchester, was using Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to chat to friends, downloading 630MB of data, and managed to rack up a bill for £2,907 last month.

She believed she was on the hotel's WiFi, but was also charged by Orange at £8 per MB because her data roaming was also on, she said.

Miss Grice said: 'When I got the bill I was in complete shock - I couldn't speak. I just kept saying I'm in debt, I can't afford to pay it.

'They need to warn people and be open about the costs of roaming. When I spoke to them I said "I haven't called anyone, I haven't sent any texts, it can't be right".

'I work in a salon and you hear so many stories like mine where people have had a shock bill. It's ridiculous'.

Her father Rob, 43, said Carissa was in tears when she got home to discover the bill.

'She was devastated. She is a trainee nail technician and on the minimum wage but I told her she was going to have to pay because we couldn't afford to.

'The thing is that if she had sent the same amount of data in texts, rather than using the internet, the bill would have been more like £350. It's unfair'.

Cry for help: The 18-year-old tweeted in the days after returning that she was going to have to pay the debt

Mr Grice said he bought a data bundle before they went abroad 'but it clearly wasn't enough'.

In shock: Miss Grice said Orange and other companies should do better at warning about roaming costs

He added that Orange shut off the phone and contacted her daughter when the bill hit £1,000, part-way through the holiday, only to tell her that there was a mix-up and it was reactivated again.

They then contacted her again on the day she came back, when the bill was now at £2,907, he said.

Mr Grice added: 'I think there should be a cap, there are with other networks. She has a £30 a month contract, when anyone's bill hits double that they should be contacted in my view, not when it reaches £1,000.'

Orange said today it had sent texts to the phone to point out the data use, and had demanded the bill to be paid.

But it has since decided to slash it to around £250.

A spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'In this instance, Mrs Grice purchased a bundle which was not big enough for her usage. As a gesture of goodwill, we’ve recalculated her bill with the most appropriate bundles applied'.

It is not the first case of this kind for Orange.

A teacher has told of how she ended up with a £2,600 bill after downloading a Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa.

Katie Bryan, a maths teacher from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, was visiting her South African-born boyfriend’s family when she downloaded the music to her iPhone via iTunes.

Katie Bryan, 43, from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, downloaded a £8.99 'best of' Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa which ended up costing her of £2,609.31

Contact
 your network operator before you leave: Often they have cheaper bundles
 or tariffs available if you know you're going abroad

Ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use, to stop your bill spiraling.

Turn off auto-updating of apps or email retrieval: Again this means you won't use any data allowance

Use mobile websites instead of full desktop view: This will save data per page

Turn off data roaming all together: If you don't want to use the internet when you're away

When the 43-year-old returned to the UK, she discovered that her bank account was more than £2,000 overdrawn as a result of a direct debit to phone company Orange of £2,609.31.

The multiple-track ‘best of’ CD of the 
legendary American singer-songwriter's greatest hits for £8.99, ended up
 costing her £2,609.31

Ms Bryan said: ‘I'd had a bit of wine but not too much. I'm really not that big a Neil Diamond fan.

'I think Orange is preying on people who make a mistake while abroad.

'There is no way this huge bill relates to the actual cost to Orange.

‘You hear of people doing this and you think "stupid person - why did you do that?" I do feel foolish.

‘But I also feel it is morally wrong to be expected to pay this sort of money for a Neil Diamond album’

Orange agreed to cut her bill to £400 and apologised.

A mother who downloaded five minutes of a film on her phone while abroad for her poorly son has been handed a £1,118 bill.

Stacey
 Withers, 25, has said getting the clip from cartoon Madagascar 3 has 
cost her more than the week's family break to Turkey they were on.

The dental nurse had downloaded the DreamWorks film to cheer up 
three-year-old Joel who fell ill with an ear infection during the 
holiday last October.

But she was left devastated when she 
discovered the short clip had cost her a whopping £1,118 - £101 more
 than the family holiday and the equivalent of £223 for every minute
 of the film.

In shock: Stacey Withers downloaded the film 'Madagascar' for her poorly son, Joel, which cost her more than £1,100

Last September a British holidaymaker racked up a 
staggering £20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to 
upload holiday snaps to Facebook.

Shocked
 Helen Christie, 40, was landed with the massive bill, which is 28 times
 the amount she paid for her holiday, when she decided to share photos 
of her trip to Turkey on the social network.

But
 by using her Orange mobile internet to upload the pictures, she ran up 
data roaming charges which worked out at huge £2,700 per day.

Helen, of Woolwich, 
South East London, had planned for her trip by buying £6 per day 'travel
 saver' mobile internet bundle from her network provider.

But Orange said that by buying into 
the deal, she had opted out of the cap on her normal tariff, which 
limits internet charges to £42 per day.

Upon her return, the mother-of-two was faced with monthly repayments of £3,000.

A schoolgirl enjoying a dream holiday 
ran up a £3,800 bill after uploading pictures of her trip onto Facebook 
with her mobile phone this summer.

Casey Snook, 14, used the website to post regular updates about her time in New York.

She
 eagerly told friends about her visits to the Empire State Building, 
Central Park and Times Square and uploaded a series of pictures with her
 iPhone.

But she was unaware
 of the massive bill until her father’s bank account - which funded the 
phone - suddenly went overdrawn after the holiday.

Phone company Orange said she 
ran up the charges by using Facebook with data roaming - a service which
 enables internet access abroad.

Her mother, Kate Snook, 43, a catering assistant, accused the company of 'extortion'.
