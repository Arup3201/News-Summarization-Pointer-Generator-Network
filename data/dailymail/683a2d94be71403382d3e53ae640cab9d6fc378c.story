It may be the height of the summer with millions of Britons enjoying well-deserved breaks in the sun.

But big-name retailers have decided that it's the ideal time to start putting Christmas cards on the shelves.

Clintons is just one high street name that decided to get the countdown to festive period under way at the start of this month - just as the country was basking in a heat wave.

The large display of Christmas cards at Clintons in Solihull has attracted a lot of attention from shoppers, with customers spending £100 a week

While the UK's recent battering by Hurricane Bertha may have brought an unwelcome reminder of autumnal chills, shoppers could still be forgiven for thinking Christmas has come a little early.

At the card retailer's store in the Touchwood shopping centre in Solihull, West Midlands, the move has clearly struck a chord with some buyers.

Assistant store manager Latoya Woodburn said customers had been spending up to £100 a week in the fortnight since the shop's 8ft (2.4m) sale display had gone up.

Cards are not the only festive-themed wares, with winter wonderland wrapping paper and tree decorations, some featuring Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer also up for grabs.

Ms Woodburn said some customers had told staff it was too early, but the till receipts showed there was clearly a market despite December 25 being nearly four months away.

She said: 'It's caused some reaction, but the sales are coming through the tills.

'People are coming in on a normal shop and just picking up a few Christmas cards at the same time.

'We do have some customers saying it's a bit too early, but we just smile and say 'Merry Christmas' - it's best to be prepared.'

Shoppers were divided on whether it was still too soon to be thinking about sending season's greetings.

Michelle Walker, from Solihull, said: 'It does seem a bit soon, but if you're trying to keep your finances on track and spread the cost throughout the year, it's probably a good thing,

'We haven't even got summer out of the way yet though - it's a bit difficult to understand, but then I suppose people want different things.'

Selfridges has already opened its Christmas store – with 134 shopping days left to buy all the celebration's essentials.

The department store proudly claims to be the first in the world to launch its Christmas shop, with the North Pole-themed space set to welcome shoppers dressed in sunglasses and shorts.

It is expected to appeal mainly to tourists wanting to take home a memento.

A pub was forced to take down a Christmas tree last week after a backlash from customers.

Manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go.

But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had now taken down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.
