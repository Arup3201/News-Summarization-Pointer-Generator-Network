Two British tourists have been arrested in Portugal after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party.

Police raced into action after receiving a string of 999 calls about an abduction in Lisbon's Restauradores Square.

Terrified callers told police they had seen masked men forcing two women into a white van.

Several police vehicles were sent to the scene and began to chase the van. However, when they stopped it, the two women turned out to be thrill-seekers who had paid to be kidnapped for their birthday celebrations.

Held: Two British tourists have been arrested in Lisbon, Portugal,  after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party

The pair were arrested along with four Portuguese nationals - the owner of the unnamed company and three other men involved in the pretend abduction.

Police have confiscated the vehicle used in the fake kidnap and a video used to film the experience.

Those arrested were due to appear in court in Lisbon yesterday on suspicion of criminal simulation, a crime which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence. None of the six detainees have been named.

The bizarre incident occurred around 15.30pm on Sunday at Restauradores Square in Lisbon city centre.

The square is dedicated to the restoration of the independence of Portugal in 1640 after 60 years of Spanish domination.

Hit: The incident is remarkably similar to the storyline in hit film The Game, starring Michael Douglas

The four men and two Brits police arrested are aged between 27 and 40.The women are thought to have flown to Portugal with a group of nine friends to celebrate their 40th birthdays.

A police source said: 'The incident provoked social alarm and terrified several passers-by at the scene.'

Extreme kidnapping is the latest thrill for adrenaline junkies. People can pay up to £1,000 to be abducted and tortured. 

Customers of French firm Ultime Realite - which is completely unconnected to this incident -  can buy a basic abduction package in which they are seized by strangers, bundled into a car bound and gagged, and kept in a dark cellar for hours.

Boat chases and helicopter escapes can be added to the tailor-made experience.

Customers explain what they want and once the scenario is established, they sign a contract and liability waiver, but have no idea exactly when or where their abductors will strike.

The company's website promises: 'You will go through the real sensations of violence, terror and fear of a real kidnapping - a psychological shock that you won't forget in a hurry.'

The incident is remarkably similar to the 1997 thriller The Game starring Michael Douglas, in which the protagonist is trapped in a real-life 'game' organised by a shadowy group called Consumer Recreation Services.
