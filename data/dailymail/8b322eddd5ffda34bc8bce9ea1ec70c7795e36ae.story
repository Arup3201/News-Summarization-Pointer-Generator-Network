Patrick Vieira expects another team to one day emulate Arsenal's Invincibles and go unbeaten throughout a full Barclays Premier League campaign.

It is 10 years this month since the Gunners' incredible 49-game unbeaten streak was finally ended by title rivals Manchester United in an emotionally-charged showdown at Old Trafford.

Arsene Wenger's men had not tasted a league defeat at all in the 2003-04 season and in doing so matched a feat which had only been achieved once before in the top flight - by the Preston side of 1888-89.

However, on the same day Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock suggested today's Chelsea team may well finish this season unbeaten too, Vieira concedes Arsenal's monumental achievement could well be repeated someday.

Former midfielder Vieira, who was speaking at Manchester's National Football Museum where he was being inducted into the English Hall of Fame, told Press Association Sport: 'Yes, I think it will be matched one day.

'Records are there to be beaten and that will be achieved one day by one team. We just have to wait and see which team will do it.'

Warnock believes that like Vieira's Arsenal, Jose Mourinho's current crop are nearly 'flawless' and strong across the board.

Vieira, who now works as the head of Manchester City's elite development squad, thinks the key to the Invincibles' success was the close bond they shared at Highbury.

'That is something that will stay in our memories forever,' the Frenchman added of their historic campaign.

'We achieved something that no other teams have achieved so far.

'When you look at the team and how close together we were, it was really good to be a part of this team.

'You don't achieve this kind of target if you're not close to each other and you don't have the same target.

'We were really united, a strong team and when you look at the talented players we had in that team, it was fantastic.'
