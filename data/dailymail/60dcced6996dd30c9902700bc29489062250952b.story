Aston Villa have been fined £60,000 and warned about their future conduct after failing to control their players at Leicester.

The club admitted the players did not conduct themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from proactive behaviour.

The fine comes after Villa and Leicester players scuffled following Matty James' tackle on Jores Okore at the end of the Foxes' 1-0 Barclays Premier League win earlier this month.

It is the third time this season Villa have been hit with such a charge following similar incidents in the matches with Spurs on November 2 and Manchester United on December 20.

The incidents have resulted in £20,000 and £30,000 fines respectively.
