Chelsea players weren't prepared to work hard for Andre Villas-Boas, meaning his time in charge was always destined to be short-lived.

The former Blues boss lasted nine months at Stamford Bridge amid dressing room spats and disappointing results.

And, according to Ashley Cole, the squad who eventually went on to win the Champions League and FA Cup that season didn't play for the Portuguese.

Matches: 40 

Wins: 19 

Draws: 11 

Losses: 10 

Win %: 47.50 

'There were some players who didn't want to work hard for Villas-Boas,' Cole told ESPN. 'But as soon as [Roberto] Di Matteo arrived, that all changed.' 

Di Matteo managed to conjure more fight and belief from Chelsea, who stunningly beat Bayern Munich on penalties after Didier Drogba's late equaliser in normal time at the Allianz Arena. 

That, coupled with the FA Cup triumph, proved  quality had always been there - Villas-Boas wasn't able to unlock it on a consistent basis.

The Portuguese went on to manage Tottenham and is now boss of Zenit St Petersburg.

Cole, meanwhile, also revealed that his favourite England manager was the much-maligned Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

'Eriksson allowed us to be ourselves,' he said. 'We enjoyed playing for England under him.

'At the time, the English media made us out to be the best in the world, but we rarely really were and that put us under excessive pressure.'
