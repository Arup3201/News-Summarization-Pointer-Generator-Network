Alberto Moreno admits his departure from Sevilla has been emotional and complicated but he is relishing the prospect of joining Liverpool.

The 22-year-old arrived at the club's Melwood training ground on Wednesday to finalise a £12million move to Anfield after Sevilla relented in Liverpool's long pursuit for the left-back.

The defender did not appear to train with his new team-mates, however, as they geared up for their opening game of the Premier League season against Southampton on Sunday.

Lazar Markovic - who has been suffering from a tendon problem - took part in training raising hopes that he may be fit for Sunday. New loan signing Javer Manquilllo also took part in the session at Melwood.  

Moreno, meanwhile, was pulled from Sevilla's starting line-up to face Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff on Tuesday night and bade a tearful farewell to fans and team-mates after the 2-0 defeat at the Millennium Stadium.

'I am living a strange situation because I'm leaving the club of my life,' Moreno told ABC de Sevilla.

'I was always aware of the two teams (trying) to agree (a deal). I never got into that but Sevilla have understood that Liverpool's offer was good and I am going.

'(I have) many feelings together. What happened on the pitch, with the fans, will remain forever etched on me and I could not help but mourn (his departure) because I did not expect it.

'First came the parting with colleagues, then with the fans...all very complicated. Liverpool are a great team and of course I'm super-motivated. I hope things go well.'

Moreno's arrival will be Liverpool's eighth summer signing, although Belgium striker Divock Origi has immediately returned to former club Lille on loan.

Acquiring the defender, providing much-needed competition for Jose Enrique, will take manager Brendan Rodgers' spending past the £100m mark this summer.

However, that has been significantly offset by the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and offloading high-earning goalkeeper Jose Reina to Bayern Munich, while the imminent sale of Martin Kelly to Crystal Palace could bring in another £2m.

The future of Denmark captain Daniel Agger remains in doubt now Rodgers has six centre-backs to choose from but for one of that group the way forward is clear.

Trabzonspor were keen on veteran Kolo Toure but the Ivory Coast international intends to see out the final year of his Reds' contract.

'Trabzonspor are interested in me but I have expressed my pleasure at being a Liverpool player,' Toure told Sport-Ivoire.

'Yes, it is always a possibility to join a lower league for more playing time but I am a competitor and I decided to stay at Liverpool.

'The season is full of matches in the league and Champions League and I know I have time to prove I'm still hungry but I know I will not play every game, that's for sure.

'I had talks with the coach, who clearly indicated that I was part of his plans. I feel good physically and at 33 years of age I am ready for any challenge.

'I continue to work hard in training to keep up the momentum and it is why the coach wants to keep me at Liverpool, because I am a fighter.

'I intend to start the season with the same goals: to enable the club to progress and to please all fans of Liverpool.

'It is a privilege to be at Liverpool. I am very happy to wear the shirt of this legendary club. The situation can change at any time but for the moment I am at Liverpool and I want to carry on with the club.'

At the other end of the scale Rodgers has been impressed by the progress made by 19-year-old Raheem Sterling, who has carried on the impressive performances of the previous campaign into Liverpool's pre-season games.

'Something we said to Raheem when he first broke into the team and we've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player,' Rodgers told liverpoolfc.com.

New season, new challenge: Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his team can go one better this season

'His identity is he has to score goals and create goals. That's what the job is. He scored 10 goals last year and this kid is only going to get better.

'When you look at the finish against Manchester City in New York, how many times have we seen [Lionel] Messi produce a touch like that, taking it through bodies when it's so tight in the box?

'The great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat. When he gets the ball you think: "Something could happen here".

'He's taking it all in his stride and now he's in a good place with every part of his game. It's just about maintaining that commitment to his work. He's still only 19, but in big games he's performed and he's a wonderful talent.'
