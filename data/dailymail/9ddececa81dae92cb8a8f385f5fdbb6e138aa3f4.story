Apple has revealed its latest weapon in the battle to take on Google in the mapping wars - making them more real.

The firm today launched an update to its 3D flyover map of London, showing the London Eye rotating and the real time on Big Ben.

Apple also added several new cities to the flyover feature of its Maps app in a bid to rival Google.

The firm has made a huge effort to boost the quality of its maps.

One of the most impressive features are the 3D flyovers of major cities, which Apple creates using data from plane and helicopter flyovers

Today Apple added Edinburgh, Scotland; Linz, Austria; Venice, Italy; Cáceres, Spain; Rennes, France; Guadalajara, Mexico and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Also additional US cities.

'Flyover in Apple Maps lets you see select major metro areas from the air with photo-realistic, interactive 3D views,' the firm says.

'You can explore cities in high resolution as you zoom, pan, tilt, and rotate around the city and its landmarks.'

Apple has also taken steps to boost the number of places available, and the information about them. 

In October, it launched launched Maps Connect in the US, enabling businesses to edit or add listings, as well as set up indoor mapping within selected areas. 

Entries made by businesses typically show up in Apple Maps around a week later. 

The international rollout has reached the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore, and was today  expanded to Canada, France and Germany. 

The service has also gained two new language options, French and German, to correspond with the regional expansion.

Apple also finally switched from Google Maps to its own mapping service on iCloud.com in December. 

Apple-leased camera cars have been spotted recently, with some suggesting that they are being used to add Street View style images to Apple Maps, while others believe they are part of the Apple 'Titan' Car project.

The London Eye has also been updated, and now rotates and users see it

Apple has also added Venice to its flyover section, allowing people to tour in 3D

Last year the service hit the headlines when one user claimed he has spotted Nessie on it.

This shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by a satellite.

For six months the image has been studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, where excitement is mounting after various explanations for it were ruled out... leaving them to conclude it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. 

Google also offers a 3D version of its map showing Big Ben - but the image is stativ

A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, may have provided proof that the legend lives on - with amazing images of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch

This new sonar image was revealed just weeks after satellite images appeared to show a mystery object in the loch. A shadowy form, pictured, measuring around 100ft long (30 metres) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the Apple Maps app

Club president Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said: ‘We’ve been looking at it for a long time trying to work out exactly what it is.

‘It looks like a boat wake, but the boat is missing. 

'You can see some boats moored at the shore, but there isn’t one here. 

'We’ve shown it to boat experts and they don’t know what it is.

‘Whatever this is, it is under the water and heading south, so unless there have been secret submarine trials going on in the loch, the size of the object would make it likely to be Nessie.’
