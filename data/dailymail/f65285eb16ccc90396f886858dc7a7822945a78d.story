Hit web video 'Women of LA' has attracted an angry response from female comedians and musicians aiming to smash the perception that women in the celebrity capital of the world are not just vain, vacuous drug addicts chasing sugar daddies and living off their rich parents.

In 'Women of LA', which has had nearly a million hits since it was uploaded, comedians Jamie Abrams and DJ Lubel sing about not being attractive or rich enough to attract any LA women, despite being nice guys.

But in 'Nice Guys of LA' female comedians and rapper 2-K sing about men who think of themselves as nice guys but are actually raging misogynists who are only interested in hot, shallow women and think they are entitled to sex.

In one section, DJ Lubel raps: 'I want a nice guy whose presence I enjoy, who sees in me more than just a walking, talking f*** toy.

'Wait, I forgot, it's more important that I'm hot, and relying on my vagina is for sure my best shot!

'Ignorance is bliss, I'm better off lobotomised with big fake t***!'

The video also features sections with self-appointed nice guys displaying what shallow hypocrites they really are. The chorus of the song runs: 'We deserve to get laid. We are the nice guys of LA.'

One heavy-set moustachioed man, writhing on a sofa in his dressing gown and socks, sings: 'I've got some chick flicks on Blu-ray, so take a chance on me today - only hot girls though, OK?'

Other portions show men blaming women for being shallow instead of blaming their own failings as human beings for their inability to get a woman.

One desultory-looking man sings: 'Whores don't like me because I'm short', followed by a pipe-smoking man reading a pretentious book who emotes: 'Sluts don't want the intellectual sort.'

Those offended by 'Women of LA' have praised the video in the Youtube comments.

Katherine Cowell said: 'YES. This is awesome. Keep doing what you do. The Girls of LA needed a response.'

However, the message has not resonated with everyone.

Perhaps with tongue firmly in cheek, user CWSOjourner said: 'Love you ladies, you are all perfect!

'Or, you would be if you lost, like, five pounds or so.'
