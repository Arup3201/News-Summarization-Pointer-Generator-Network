Phil Neville has turned down the chance to work under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United to sit on the television sofa next season for Match of the Day.

After being announced as one of the MOTD team in their 50th anniversary season, Neville told his one million Twitter followers that he no longer held a coaching position at Manchester United where he worked as David Moyes’ first-team coach last season.

He was asked: 'Phil, are you still on the coaching team at United?' and replied: 'No'.

United later said Neville’s departure 
was his decision and that the club had been keen to give him a role 
along with other 'Class of 92' stalwarts Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt.

They will now try to speak to Neville to 
see if he can remain connected with United in some other way, possibly 
in an ambassadorial or community role.

A
 spokesman said: 'We remain of the view that we wanted him involved and 
didn’t think his television work would get in the way, as it hasn’t done
 for his brother, Gary.'

But
 37-year-old Neville, who was roundly criticised for his co-commentary 
during England’s World Cup match against Italy in the summer, decided he
 wanted to concentrate fully on his broadcast career.

His position under Van Gaal was likely to be more junior and less influential than it had been under Moyes.

Confirmation: Neville takes to twitter to confirm that he is no longer on the coaching staff at Old Trafford

Neville
 played nearly 400 games in 11 years at United before signing for 
Everton in 2005 and returned to Old Trafford as a coach last year.

But
 with Van Gaal assisted by Giggs and Butt as well as backroom staff from
 Holland, Neville has decided to throw his full lot in with the BBC, 
rivals to Sky Sports who have made his brother Gary Neville a 
broadcasting star.

Match of the Day will have a new feel to it this season following the retirement of Alan Hansen.

Besides
 Neville, host Gary Lineker will be joined on the sofa by newcomers Ruud
 Gullit and Rio Ferdinand, and Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage, Danny 
Murphy.

Neville’s decision to leave United was probably partly-influenced by the negative response to his work for the BBC in Brazil.

They
 had more than 400 complaints about Neville’s staccato and monotone 
delivery leaving the ex-player to admit it has been 'harder' than he 
expected, joking that he was glad he could 'help the nation sleep'.

Even so, the BBC have decided to try to utilise his insight and knowledge of the game in a different way.

The news will disappoint United who are keen to have as many former players on their staff as possible.

Executive
 vice-chairman Ed Woodward said on the club’s recent pre-season tour of 
America that he hoped Neville and Paul Scholes would have a part to play
 on Van Gaal’s team.
