Nelson Herne, 35, of Bedworth, admitted blackmail after the gang he was part of plundered a grieving widow's life savings

A ruthless blackmail gang plundered a grieving widow's £195,000 savings - after hounding her over a non-existent debt.

The 80-year-old, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, handed over the cash - earmarked for her grandchildren's inheritance - when the men threatened her with bailiffs.

But Birmingham Crown Court heard that, in reality, the vulnerable pensioner did not owe them a anything.

Five criminals pleaded guilty to their roles in the fraud, including Nelson Herne who was jailed after admitting blackmail.

Judge Simon Drew QC told the gang: 'This was the deliberate targeting of an elderly and vulnerable victim.

'She was somebody who was easily preyed upon.'

Tom Kenning, prosecuting, said the victim's former husband, who had suffered from Alzheimer's, controlled the finances.

In March last year she received a letter from a firm called Midland Recovery Services claiming she owed £12,825.

Phone calls followed, threatening her with bailiffs unless she paid up, the court heard.

'She was a very vulnerable lady who did not know whether this debt was true or not,' Mr Kenning said.

'She was effectively targeted.'

Mr Kenning said the victim, who lived with her disabled son, handed over thousands of pounds at a time to six people who called at her door.

Some of the six had not been charged, the court heard.

They went as far as giving her details of bank accounts and sort codes to allow her to make deposits.

In a statement, the victim said she had been left feeling vulnerable and threatened and the gang had stolen her grandchildren's inheritance.

The court heard he was currently serving a four-and-a-half year sentence for a similar scam.

In that case, the victim was defrauded out of £17,000 after being told his home was infested with rats.

Four others involved all received suspended sentences after pleading guilty to possessing criminal property.

Sean Bell, 27, of Bedworth, Warwickshire was handed a ten-month suspended term, ordered to perform 150 hours' unpaid work and pay £250 compensation.

Louis Cashin, 36, of Bedworth, was given a nine-month suspended sentence, ordered to perform 200 hours' unpaid work and pay £1,000 compensation.

Albert Blair, 58, of Brownhills, West Midlands received a suspended term of 16 months. He was ordered to pay £250 compensation.

And Christopher Thirlwell, 30, of Nuneaton, was handed an eight-month suspended sentence, ordered to perform 150 hours' unpaid work and pay £1,500 compensation.

Peter Cook, representing Thirlwell, said it was a 'one-off aberration' that happened when he was in financial difficulty.

Tariq Shakoor, for Bell, said he had been taken advantage of.
