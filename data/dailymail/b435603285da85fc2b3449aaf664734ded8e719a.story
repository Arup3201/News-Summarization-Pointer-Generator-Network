The families of two teenage girls who were killed in a Maryland freight train derailment in 2012 have reached an undisclosed settlement with the railroad.

On August 21, 2012, a  train derailed in Ellicott City as 19-year-olds Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass sat on framework next to the tracks which went over the town's Main Street.

Twenty-one of the 80 rail cars overturned, and the two teenagers were buried in coal in the disaster which took place close to midnight. The girls died of asphyxiation.

A spokesman for the railroad, CSX Transportation, said the terms of the settlement were confidential. The settlement was reached in November. 

In July, federal officials found that the derailment was caused by a broken rail on a section of track being monitored because of previous problems.

The families of Mayr and Nass had criticized CSX and said they were considering filing a lawsuit. Neither family could be reached for comment.  

Two train operators were not harmed in the derailment where cranes had to be used to remove some of the railroad cars.

'Many of those train cars fell onto automobiles, literally fell onto automobiles with the coal,' Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said at the time of the incident.

'So you have massive piles of coal and heavy train cars on top of automobiles.' 

Miss Nass was a student at James Madison University in Virginia and Miss Mayr was a student at the University of Delaware.

Shortly before the tragedy unfolded, the two friends had posted photos and updates to their Twitter pages, one of their feet hanging off the bridge in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore, and another, which read: ‘Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign.’ 

The girls were trespassing at the time of their deaths at a popular hang-out spot for local young people.

Earlier, Miss Nass had tweeted: ‘Once before I leave you for school… you, me, a handle of burnett’s, and some form of public transportation.’  

Ellicott City is a picturesque town where there are several bars alongside gift and antique shops in converted old buildings. 

The railroad runs across Main Street in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore.

The train had two locomotives, was 3,000-feet-long and weighed 9,000 tons.

About 100 pounds of coal spilled into a tributary of the Patapsco River, a major Maryland waterway that parallels the tracks, said Maryland Department of the Environment spokesman Jay Apperson in 2012.
