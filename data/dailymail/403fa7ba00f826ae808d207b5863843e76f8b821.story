Leaders of the so-called Islamic State insurgency and Al Qaeda's offshoot in Syria have agreed a truce and a plan to wipe out Western-backed rebels in the country, it is claimed.

Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra have until now fought a bitter internecine war for supremacy in the rebellion against the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad.

But a high-level Syrian opposition official and a rebel commander have told The Associated Press that they've learned of a deal between the factions to join forces against Western-backed groups.

Still alive? Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who had been reportedly killed in a U.S. airstrike, apparently speaks in an audio message released by the group to supporters this week 

It comes as an audio message by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was released urging supporters to unlease a 'volcano of jihad' on opponents - and seemingly disproving claims he had been killed in a U.S. airstrike.

Lacing his speech with religious phrases, the voice believed to belong to Baghdadi describes jihad as 'the peak of Islam' and said those who do not fight non-believers will suffer 'painful torment. 

Militant leaders from Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra gathered at a farmhouse in northern Syria last week, opposition officials told The Associated Press.

Their new agreement, according to the sources in rebel groups opposed to both IS and Nusra Front, would involve a promise to stop fighting and team up in attacks in some areas of northern Syria.

AP reported last month on signs that the two groups appear to have curtailed their feud with informal local truces.

Any accord could present major difficulties for Washington's strategy against the Islamic State insurgency. While warplanes from a U.S.-led coalition strike militants from the air, the Obama administration has counted on arming 'moderate' rebel factions to push them back on the ground.

Those rebels, already considered relatively weak and disorganised, would face far stronger opposition if the two heavy-hitting militant groups now are working together.

According to a Syrian opposition official speaking in Turkey, the meeting took place on November 2 in the town of Atareb, west of Aleppo, starting at around midnight and lasting until 4am.

The official said the meeting was closely followed by members of his movement, and he is certain that an agreement was reached. The official said about seven top militant leaders attended.

A second source, a commander of brigades affiliated with the Western-backed Free Syrian Army who is known as Abu Musafer, said he also had learned that high-ranking members of Nusra and IS met on November 2.

He did not disclose the exact location, but said it was organized by a third party and took place in an area where the FSA is active.

According to Abu Musafer, two decisions were reached: First, to halt infighting between Nusra and IS and second, for the groups together to open up fronts against Kurdish fighters in a couple of new areas of northern Syria.

Best laid plans... The Obama administration has counted on arming 'moderate' rebel factions to push Islamists back on the ground in Syria, as well as topple the Syrian regime

The Nusra Front has long been seen as one of the toughest factions trying to oust Assad in a civil war estimated to have killed more than 200,000 since 2011.

Islamic State entered the Syria war in 2012 from its original home in Iraq and quickly earned a reputation for brutality. It has tried to impose itself as the leading rebel faction behind which all pious Muslims should unite.

Al-Qaida initially rejected IS's claims to any role in Syria, and Nusra and other factions entered a war-within-a-war against it. But the Islamic State group swelled in power and became flush with weapons and cash after overrunning much of northern and western Iraq over the summer.

According to the opposition official, the meeting included an IS representative, two emissaries from Nusra Front, and attendees from the Khorasan Group, a small but battle-hardened band of al-Qaida veterans from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Also reported present at the meeting was Jund al-Aqsa, a hard-line faction that has sworn allegiance to IS; and Ahrar al-Sham, a conservative Muslim rebel group.

The official said IS and the Nusra Front agreed to work to destroy the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, a prominent rebel faction armed and trained by the U.S. and led by a fighter named Jamal Maarouf.

They agreed to keep fighting until all of the force, estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000 fighters, was eliminated, the official said.
