This is the shocking moment a motorcyclist was thrown head over heels by a hit-and-run motorist - but miraculously walked away virtually unharmed.

Andrius Cesna, 33, had stopped at a roundabout on his Yahama bike when careless Richard Themistocleou, 35, slammed straight into the back of him.

He was catapulted into the air and bounced off the bonnet of Themistocleou's company Vauxhall Astra before hitting the road and skidding across the tarmac.

Mr Cesna quickly got to his feet clutching his back, with the whole accident filmed on a motorist's dashcam

But instead of stopping to help the stricken motorcyclist, the callous motorist took a quick glance out of his window and sped off.

Miraculously, married Andrius walked away virtually unhurt although his Â£5,000 bike was written off.

The horrific crash on the B6265 at Riddlesden, West Yorkshire was captured on the dashboard camera of another motorist.

When arrested, Themistocleou, a service engineer for ADT Security, claimed he had no memory of the smash and then reported his car as stolen.

After the accident, Mr Cesna, 33, promised his wife he would never get on a motorbike again

Mr Cesna, an HGV driver from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: 'He just hit me and drove off.

'I think I hit the car first then I hit the motorbike and then the road.

'I remember everything about it, it was a very scary moment. I thought he was going to kill me. I was just thinking "I'm going to die". It was very quick.

'I got up as quick as I could because I didn't feel anything at that moment and wanted to get out of the road.

'I sat down and I was panicking and I was in shock. It was terrifying.'

Themistocleous, of Riddlesden, Keighley, West Yorkshire, was charged with driving without due care and attention, failing to stop and failing to report an accident.

District Judge Susan Bouch, sitting at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates court, sentenced him to ten weeks imprisonment suspended for 12 months, with 150 hours unpaid community work, and gave him ten penalty points.

After the accident Mr Cesna promised his wife Simona, 32, he would never get on a bike again.

'She never wanted me to drive a motorbike in the first place,' he said. 'The bike was totally written off.'
