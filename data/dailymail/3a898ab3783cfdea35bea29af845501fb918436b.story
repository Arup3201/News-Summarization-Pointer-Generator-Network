For a good ten years now, coffee has been Britain’s new obsession – with high street chains popping up everywhere to challenge our image as a nation of tea drinkers.

But the new brand of caffeine launched by a major tourist attraction may be a step too far for even the most latté-obsessed fans of hot beverages.

Not necessarily everyone's cup of coffee: You may need a strong stomach to try the Rat Cafe

London Dungeon – an enclave of spooky corridors and shock-tactic exhibits which looks at the darker side of the history of the capital city – is celebrating the opening of its Rat Café, and with it, the chance for guests to enjoy a nice mug of ‘Ratuccino’.

The concept has been dreamed up in response to the current Japanese craze for ‘Cat Cafes’ – where customers sip lunchtime drinks in the company of resident felines.

Mixed reception: Some guests at the cafe seemed pleased to meet the 'locals' - others seemed less sure

This London version, as you might have guessed, involves not purring moggies but scampering, twitching – and very real – rodents.

Brave souls can also opt to eat at the café – where, if they can stomach the bad pun as much as the very idea of it – they can try Black Forest Rateux.

Health and safety officials will be relieved to hear that neither food nor drink at the Rat Café includes rats as genuine ingredients – but willing guests can, if they so choose, enjoy both while the little creatures dash about the room, or even sit on their shoulders.

Although this unusual form of catering is largely for fun, there is also a mildly serious point to it – an attempt to rehabilitate the image of a much-maligned creature.

‘Rats have been tarnished with an undeserved reputation throughout history – from the Black Death of the Middle Ages to the great stink of Victorian times,’ says Hywel Mathias of London Dungeon.

‘We wanted to challenge those perceptions and show they are actually characterful and full of fun.’

Eighteen rats were unleashed on café guests – all of whom have rodent day jobs at the London Dungeon, and have been vetted to mingle with the public.

‘We have 18 rodents living here, and they are a huge hit with our guests, who get to see them close up in their special display, with giant viewing windows,’ Mr Mathias adds.

A surprise success: Although the Rat Cafe was a one-off special, London Dungeon may make it a regular event

‘Our café takes that a step further, and lets people get even closer, handle them, stroke them and really get to know them.’

Although the Rat Café was a one-off for a group of rat-loving guests, London Dungeon is considering making the idea a regular event.

‘Judging by first reactions, this pop-up rat café could become a regular date on the eccentric things to do calendar,’ Mr Hywel says.
