Dramatic new footage shows the moment a small plane crashed in Hawaiian waters and resulted in the death of state health official Loretta Fuddy - the woman responsible for releasing President Barack Obama's longform birth certificate.

The footage obtained by ABC News was taken by a passenger on the plane, who started filming out the window of the flight just moments before it made an emergency water landing.

Water quickly starts to flood the cabin after impact, but everyone on board remains calm and quiet as they exit the sinking aircraft.

Calm: After impact, the cabin quickly begins to fill with ocean water but the passengers remain calm as they exit the plane

The getaway: The video shows the moment the passenger flees the plane, jumping into the Pacific Ocean

Survivors: Fuddy was the only one to perish in the crash. Eight others, including the pilot, either swam to shore or waited in the ocean to be rescued

Fuddy, 65, was the only person on board to perish in the crash. The other eight people on board, including the pilot, were rescued or swam to shore.

She gained notoriety in 2011 for making President's Barack Obama's birth certificate public, attempting to squash rumors that he wasn't born in the country.

Only victim: Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death among nine aboard the Cessna Grand Caravan that crashed in the ocean near Molokai, Hawaii last month

Fuddy was on the flight from Molokai to Oahu after visiting a state-run leper colony on the smaller Hawaiian island.

The incident occurred when the single engine of the 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan failed soon after it took off from Molokai and made its turn toward Honolulu, said Richard Schuman, owner of Makani Kai Air, operator of the plane.

Fuddy made it out of the sinking plane fine, but died after escaping.

In the water, Fuddy held hands with her deputy director Keith Yamamoto as he tried to help her relax, said the Rev. Patrick Killilea, who consoled Yamamoto after the ordeal.

'He recounted how he said he helped 
Loretta into her life jacket and he held her hand for some time,' the 
priest said. 'They were all floating together and she let go and there 
was no response from her.'

Coast
 Guard rescuers who arrived after making the half-hour flight from Oahu 
to the neighbor island said Thursday that the single-engine turboprop 
aircraft wasn't visible when they got there, only the nine passengers 
floating across about a half-mile of water littered with random debris

The rescuers in two helicopters and an HC-130 airplane said the people were in clusters and acted calm when help arrived.

Rescue
 swimmer Mark Peer said when he swam to Fuddy, she was unresponsive and 
he couldn't find a pulse. 'It was not a good feeling,' he said.

Proof? Fuddy entered the national spotlight briefly in 2011 when she authorized the release of Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate to put to rest so-called 'birther' conspiracies about the nation of the Commander-in-Chief's birth

C.
 Phillip Hollstein recalled that the plane had just taken off from 
Molokai and was making a turn toward Honolulu when it seemed like 
something on the plane broke.

'We probably weren't a minute out,' he said. 'It wasn't real loud or anything. Just a muffled bang. Then we were a glider.'

The plane lost power, he said, and the pilot maneuvered a water landing on the plane's belly.

'Everyone
 was real quiet. We hit (the water) and it was all about getting the 
belts off,' he said, describing how everyone started putting on life 
jackets and remained on the plane until it seemed to start sinking.

'There wasn't panic or anything. It was very orderly,' he said. 'It wasn't like any of the movies or the TV shows.'

Bobbing
 in the water, Hollstein noticed the pilot and seven other passengers 
seemed fine. 'I didn't want to sit out there bobbing, so I figured I'd 
take a shot at going to the shoreline.'

He
 guesses the swim to the rugged shoreline took an hour and a half. He 
was surprised to hear later that one of the passengers, Hawaii Health 
Director Loretta Fuddy, had later died.

'She was doing fine out of the airplane,' Hollstein said. 'Her assistant was really watching her. He was taking care of her.'

Gov.
 Neil Abercrombie said Fuddy was loved and respected. 'Her knowledge was
 vast, her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as 
from her storehouse of experience,' he said.

About
 100 Health Department employees lined up to pay their respects to 
Fuddy's family members, who attended a gathering in her memory at the 
department's parking lot following her death.

After
 the crash, three survivors were transported by helicopter to a Honolulu
 hospital. Two declined to be medically evacuated, officials said

Hollstein
 said he and a local couple were taken to the Molokai hospital, where 
they took hot showers and dried their clothing. They were given a place 
to rest until they could get rooms at the island's only hotel.

Fuddy
 and Yamamoto were on the flight after an annual visit to Kalaupapa, 
where the state exiled leprosy patients until 1969. The area is 
accessible only by plane or mule.

The leprosy settlement on Kalaupapa is still run by the Health Department, though only a few former leprosy patients continue to live there.
