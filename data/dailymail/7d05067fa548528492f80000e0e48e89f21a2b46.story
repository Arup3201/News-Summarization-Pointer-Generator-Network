West Ham's new signing Enner Valencia insists he can reach match fitness in time for their first game of the season against Tottenham.

The club's joint chairman David Sullivan said on Thursday afternoon that their £12million striker would not be available for the club's Barclays Premier League opener and would be out for two games.

But Valencia disagrees and claims he can still make it for the match on August 16. 'I'm training normally at the moment,' he said. 'I'm training hard to get match fit. I couldn't play for a couple of days after the World Cup and stopped for a while. I could still be all right for the first game of the season against Tottenham or possibly the second.'

Down and out: West Ham are already without Andy Carroll until December with an ankle problem

The 24-year-old, who scored three goals in the World Cup for Ecuador, arrived in London last Friday evening and began training with the team on the Saturday.

Sources at West Ham believe he will make the bench for the Spurs game and could play some part towards the end.

Valencia is understood to have picked up an ankle injury at the World Cup, which has left him short of match fitness.

Wildcard: Hugo Almeida might be one to consider for the Hammers and Sam Allardyce

Sullivan had said earlier in the day that it would keep the player out for the first two matches. ‘The player we’ve spent the most money on, Enner Valencia, is our big summer signing and he is about two or three weeks away from being able to play, because he was at the World Cup,' he said.

‘He’s now in full training but I think the earliest he’ll play is in the Capital One Cup match, so it’ll be exciting for people to see him make his debut in that match.’

With club record signing Andy Carroll out for up to four months with an ankle injury, West Ham are desperate for more options up front. They have made offers for four strikers in the hope that one of the deals comes off.
