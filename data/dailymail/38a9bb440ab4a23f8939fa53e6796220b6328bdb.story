Cash-strapped parents are having to cough up £91 to buy a new logo-emblazoned school sports kit for their children.

State-run Corfe Hills School in Poole, Dorset, has been slammed for charging the 'extortionate' prices for the flash PE gear.

The navy blue outfit has been made by international sports brand firm Kukri Sports and contains the school's logo.

Controversy: Right, Alan Hinchliffe, head teacher of Corfe Hills school 
in Poole, Dorset, has come under fire for asking parents to fork-out £91
to buy branded sports kit emblazoned with the school's logo

The top, shorts and socks alone cost £41 for boys and £34 for girls but the extra hooded top and tracksuit trousers costs an additional £50 to buy.

Boys:

Total: £91

Girls:

Total: £34

With sports shoes added on, the total cost of dressing a child for PE lessons runs to over £100.

The school has more than 1,500 pupils aged from 13 to 18.

Parents have been told that from the start of the September term it will be compulsory for all year nine pupils to have the kit, which is only available to buy through Kukri's website.

One concerned parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'It may be smart and look good but how can you say this is affordable?

'Why is Corfe Hills school introducing a totally-overpriced PE kit?

'Parents have no choice but to buy this, it's not as though we can go to Tesco or Asda and buy it for a fraction at the price.'

Mum Jeanette Heselden said: 'It seems
that because you have to get these kits through the school they have 
complete control over you.

'I think these prices are extortionate.'

Other secondary schools in the area that supply PE outfit with a logo charge around £45 for the same amount of kit.

Alan Hinchliffe, headteacher at Corfe
Hills, said the new kit was in response to surveys that found pupils 
thought their old uniform was 'out of date' and 'embarrassing.'

He said the new kit had the support of the school parents association and was 'very popular' with students.

Anger: Parents have hit out at the school saying that they have no choice of getting kit at cheaper rates at supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco

He
said: 'Through using an online supplier the school has managed to hold 
the kit cost and it discreetly runs a scheme that can help families with
low income.

'Initial 
take up has shown that the opportunity to buy the additional and 
non-compulsory items of track suit bottoms and hoodies has also proved 
popular.

'As part of 
the drive to have fitter and healthier students, Corfe Hills has 
increased the amount of time available for sport, increased the number 
of sports clubs and increased participation in sport.'
