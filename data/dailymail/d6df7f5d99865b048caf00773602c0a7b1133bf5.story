Shirley Temple, America's little darling, has passed away peacefully at her home in California at the age of 85.

The actress and singer died of natural causes at her home in Woodside, California, on Monday around 11pm, surrounded by her family and caregivers. 

'We
 salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a 
diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, 
great-grandmother, and adored wife for 55 years of the late and much 
missed Charles Alden Black,' her family said in a statement.

Bright Eyes: The actress's face and voice are imprinted on generations as a result of her performance of the song On The Good Ship Lollipop

The actress and singer, was born in the Californian beach town of Santa Monica on April 23, 1928, the third child of George Temple, afterwards a branch bank manager, and his wife Gertrude.

Gertrude Temple had wanted to be a ballerina but had grown too tall - so channeled her thwarted ambitions into her daughter.

Shirley Temple was just three years old when she was spotted by talent scouts at dance school and appeared on screen for the first time, in the one-reel short 'Poverty Row'.

But it was the 1934 film Bright Eyes that made her famous. The actress's face and voice are 
imprinted on generations around the world as a result of her performance
 of the song On The Good Ship Lollipop.

With her hair in ringlets, angelic face and wearing a checked 
pinafore dress, the unforgettable rendition made her one of the 
biggest box office draws of the era.

At the year's end she had entered the list of the world's top ten money-making stars at number eight.

She became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935, at the age of six.

Her handprints were placed in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood along with the biggest stars of the day.

She was the world's number one box-office star from 1935 to 1938 - leaving Clark Gable trailing in second place.

Her earnings were placed into a trust - during that time all she ever saw was $13 a month in allowance. 

Her mother, Gertrude, worked to keep her daughter from being 
spoiled by fame and was a constant presence during filming.

Her daughter
 said years later that her mother had been furious when a director once 
sent her off on an errand and then got the child to cry for a scene by 
frightening her. 'She never again left me alone on a set,' she said.

Temple went on to star in films such
 as Curly Top and The Littlest Rebel, helping the U.S. cope with the 
Great Depression of the 1930s.

Temple became a nationwide sensation. Mothers dressed their little girls like her, and a line of dolls was launched that are now highly sought-after collectables.

Her immense popularity prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to say that 'as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right'.

'When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles,' Roosevelt said.

She was credited with helping save the film
 company 20th Century Fox, which owed $42million, from bankruptcy.

In Britain, the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, were avid Temple fans.

She even had a drink named after her, an appropriately sweet and innocent cocktail of ginger ale and grenadine, topped with a maraschino cherry.

Her career faltered in 1939 
after Fox refused to loan her to MGM, she lost the lead in The Wizard of
 Oz to Judy Garland.  

However she struggled to maintain her cinematic career in adulthood, though she continued to work in television.

Career: Despite retiring from Hollywood in 1950, Shirley starred in 43 feature films, including Stand Up and Cheer and Curly Top

Despite retiring from Hollywood in 1950, Shirley starred in 43 feature films.

The actress married her first husband 
John Agar, a sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps, in 1945 when she was just 17 years old.

He is the father of her daughter Linda. The couple divorced four years later after the marriage disintegrated due to Agar's drinking and infidelity.

On holiday in Honolulu in 1950 she met and fell in love with California businessman Charles Alden Black, nine years her senior, who confessed that he had never seen one of her films.

They were married in December of that year and their son Charles Jr was born in 1952 and daughter Lori in 1954.

They lived for many years in the San Francisco suburb of Woodside.

The couple were married for 55 years until Charles passed away in August 2005 at the age of 86 from complications from a bone marrow disease.

She described him as the 'love of her life' and kept his voice on the couple's answering machine.

In 2006, when receiving a lifetime achievement award a few months after Charles had died, the veteran star said that her greatest roles were as wife, mother and grandmother.

'There's nothing like real love. Nothing,' she added.

Although she had mostly retired from showbiz, by the early 1960s Temple's interest in politics soon brought her back into the spotlight.

She made an unsuccessful bid as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967. After Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he appointed her as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly.

In the 1970s, she was U.S. ambassador to Ghana and later U.S. chief of protocol.

She then served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the administration of the first President Bush.

A few months after she arrived in Prague in mid-1989, communist rule was overthrown in Czechoslovakia as the Iron Curtain collapsed across Eastern Europe.

'My main job (initially) was human rights, trying to keep people like future President Vaclav Havel out of jail,' she said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. Within months, she was accompanying Havel, the former dissident playwright, when he came to Washington as his country's new president.

She considered her background in entertainment an asset to her political career.

'Politicians are actors too, don't you think?' she once said. 'Usually if you like people and you're outgoing, not a shy little thing, you can do pretty well in politics.'

Ms Temple Black was also a delegate to 
several international commissions and was involved with the United 
Nations.

She was the first woman to serve as US chief of protocol in the
 Department of State.

Her public service saw her on the advisory 
council and board of directors for numerous organisations involved with 
anything from criminal justice to health charities or wildlife bodies.

She also sat on the board of directors for the Bank Of California and 
the Walt Disney Company.

In 1999, the American Film Institute ranking of the top 50 screen legends placed Temple at No. 18 in a list of 25 actresses.

In 2006, Temple received the Screen 
Actors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award for having 'lived the most 
remarkable life, as the brilliant performer the world came to know when 
she was just a child to the dedicated public servant who has served her 
country both at home and abroad for 30 years'.

At the awards, Temple quipped: 'I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to receive the lifetime achievement award. Start early.'

The world's most famous child star had a surprisingly modest take on her achievements.

'I
 class myself with Rin Tin Tin,' she said once, referring to the canine 
star. 'At the end of the Depression, people were perhaps looking for 
something to cheer themselves up. They fell in love with a dog and a 
little girl. It won't happen again.'

She is survived by her children Susan, Charles Jr, and Lori, granddaughter Teresa and great-granddaughters Lily and Emma.
