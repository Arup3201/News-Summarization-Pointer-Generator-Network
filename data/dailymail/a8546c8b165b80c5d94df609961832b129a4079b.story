She gave a series of emotional interviews on the murder of her 'partner' Charb - the editor of Charlie Hebdo - and talked of her pride at him 'dying on his feet'.

But in a bizarre twist, Stephane Charbonnier's family have 'formally denied' the  relationship between him and former Secretary of State, Jeannette Bougrab.

Miss Bougrab, the mother of an adopted three-year-old daughter May, claimed they had lived together for three years.

In an emotional interview, the 41-year-old said she had begged him to leave France and that she: 'always knew he was going to die like Theo Van Gogh (the Dutch cartoonist murdered in 2004).'

The renowned editor's family have tonight demanded that she no longer speaks about the man who fronted Charlie Hebbdo, in any way to the media.

His brother, Laurent Charbonnier, speaking as well on behalf of his father and mother, said: 'We formally deny any rational commitment from Charb with Jeannette Bougrab.

'We do not want her to express herself in the manner in which she has done.

'We ask for respect for our family's mourning.'

He added that the statement was a 'one off' and there would be no further. 

But a pictured has emerged of the 'couple' with Miss Bougrab's three-year-old daughter, May.

In response to the family's statement, Miss Bougrab said her daughter called Charb 'dad'.

An emotional Jeannette Bougrab  rushed to the scene of the shooting (pictured) when her boyfriend, Stephane Charbonnier, did not reply to her texts

'Human nature is ugly. We loved each other because we were both independent personalities,' she said.

‘We didn’t do a press release to announce our relationship but we weren’t hiding it.’ 

Charbonnier was among four cartoonists killed in the Paris massacre which left 12 people dead. 

He had received death threats in the past and had been under police protection.

Reports say he was in an editorial meeting when gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi burst in and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles shouting 'Allahu akbar!' (God is great). 

The lawyer and former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed.

'I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting,' she said.

'Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn't answering and he never did that.

'When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren't allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.' 

Anger: Miss Bougrab slammed the 'inadequate' security around the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'We could have avoided this massacre'

Proudly, Miss Bougrab added: 'He died standing.

'He defended secularism. He defended the spirit of Voltaire. He, in fact, was really the fruit of this ideal of the Republic that we've almost forgotten.

'He died, executed with his comrades, as he would say.'

Bougrab, a member of the French National Council of State who served under Nicolas Sarkozy's administration has been described as a 'hard secularist'.

The daughter of Algerian immigrants she is known as a fierce critic of religion, particularly of Islam. 

Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: 'I haven't lost Charlie Hebdo. I've lost a loved one. 

'I am here, not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians.

'I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals.

'Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they've just died, they've just been murdered. 

'That's the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn't.'

Asked if she had been comforted by the world's adoption of the 'Je Suis Charlie' symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately: 'Absolutely not, because he's dead. It's absolutely not a victory. 

'It's a defeat. It's a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.'

Unmoved: Miss Bougrab took no comfort in the global show of solidarity with the deceased Charlie Hebdo journalists, saying the 'Je Suis Charlie' - I am Charlie - symbol is not a sign of victory

Harsh truth: Jeannette Bougrab said of the 'Je Suis Charlie' movement: 'I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life'

Armed response: Police train their weapons on a building where the the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen are holed up with a hostage as they sit in a helicopter over the village of Dammartin-en-Goele

She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she'd been fascinated by him before they met.

He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party.

'I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.'

Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie.

'They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.' 

Miss Bougrab is one of many people trying to cope with the sudden and shocking loss of their relatives. 

The wife of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, Georges Wolinski - who was among 12 people killed in the massacre in Paris - described the horror of learning about her husband's death through the news.

Maryse Wolinski told RTL: 'Nobody official told me - I was quite shocked by that. Talking about my husband in the aftermath of this horrific shooting is not very easy.

'I think he died with his comrades, with his brothers, such as Cabut - in the service of his beloved freedom, for which he has always fought.'

Regarding the controversial nature of their illustrations and the danger it brought, the children's author said: 'My husband was not aware of such things, he was going forward, he fought with his drawings with pencils, leaning on her drawing board.'

Maryse and Georges' daughter, Esla, posted a picture of her father's office on Instagram with the caption: 'Dad is gone, Wolinski is not.'
