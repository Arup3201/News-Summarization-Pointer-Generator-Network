Louis van Gaal is prepared to extend an olive branch to Manchester United's underperforming stars before he rushes into the transfer market this summer.

Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has said he is willing to allow the club's new manager to break the British transfer record in the club's bid to reclaim their place at the top table following a season of dalliance under former boss David Moyes.

And Van Gaal, addressing the media for the first time during United's tour of the USA ahead of his first game in charge on Wednesday against Los Angeles Galaxy at the Rose Bowl, said he will wait to see how his current squad performs before ringing the changes.

'I can’t say anything,' he said, speaking at press conference in Pasadena. 

'I
 have told the club I won’t do anything until I know the players here. 
When I am the coach and I give the orders to play a certain way I want 
to see how they perform. So I can’t answer. 

'I want to give all players the chance to show themselves under my guidance.

One of those players is Javier Hernandez. The Mexico striker
has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer after struggling
to hold down a regular first-team place in recent seasons.

But the 26-year-old could get an opportunity to shine in
front of the Dutchman in LA, alongside Wayne Rooney in attack after the England
forward pleaded with Van Gaal to let him start.

Speaking about Hernandez, Van Gaal said: 'I will have to see
how he plays.

'I have only seen him under another coach so far. He has
arrived today and now I can see him play in a game. Then I can talk about him.'

On the day James Rodriguez joined Real Madrid for £63million, when asked whether United would be willing
 to pay a similar amount for a player, United chief Woodward said: 'It is in our 
capabilities. The club are not afraid of doing that - spending 
significant amounts of money in the transfer market.'

'Whether it's a record or not doesn't really resonate with us,' Woodward said.

'What resonates is a top, top elite player that the manager wants that is going to be a star for Manchester United.

'We are in a very strong financial position. We can make big signings.

'I get pointed in the direction of a target that the manager wants and there is an assessment of what that might cost and I'll negotiate hard to do the best I can on the trade.'

Meanwhile, Luke Shaw insists he does not feel the pressure of replacing Patrice Evra, following his £30million move from Southampton. But the England star admits he is under no illusions that he must impress his new manager, Louis van Gaal.

France international Evra earlier this week completed a £2.5m switch to Italian champions Juventus but was in Los Angeles to say his farewells to his former team-mates.

And Shaw, speaking alongside fellow United new boy Ander Herrera and boss Van Gaal, said: 'When I arrived everyone told me how big the club is.

'You don't realise until you come on tour how big it is and how big fanbase is. It's crazy.

'I don’t feel pressure filling in for Evra. He has been great for ten years and hopefully I can carry it on.

'Of course, I have to prove myself but I try not to focus on the pressure. I focus on my own game.

'With a new manager I know I have to impress in training.

'Manchester United is biggest club in world and will push me to the best. I know the club will improve me and that’s why I am here.'

I am happy to be here but don’t want to talk about last summer (when he could have joined).

Herrera echoed Shaw’s sentiments as 
the £24million summer recruit from Atheltic Bilbao insisted he is ready
 to make a name for himself at Old Trafford.

‘I will miss friends and family,’ he said. ‘But I think I’m ready for this big step. I’m ready for this time.

‘I am 24 years old and this is the moment to come to the biggest club in the world.

‘I come here to be a good professional but there are other players in midfield. Between us I am sure we will help the team.

‘But it’s not only me. There are a lot of midfielders. They can play well, too.’
