Ronny Deila will prioritise tying down his existing stars ahead of signing new ones when the transfer window opens at the turn of the year.

With his Celtic side still in four competitions, the Norwegian admits he would like to make ‘one or two’ additions to his squad in the January window.

However, with Kris Commons out of contract in the summer, John Guidetti coming to the end of his deal at Manchester City and Virgil van Dijk the subject of constant speculation, Deila intends on dealing with current players before his mind turns to fresh faces.

Ronny Deila has admitted he will concentrate on keeping hold of his current players when the window opens

John Guidetti's Manchester City contract ends soon, and Celtic would like a permanent deal for the striker

Asked if the priority was ensuring his current stars prolonged their stays, Deila replied: ‘Yes, that is the case. It is much easier to develop what you have, when you know what you have. To get people in, is like getting presents. You never know what you get. It could be nice or something you have to throw away.

‘It’s very interesting to get presents but it does not always turn out the way you want to.

‘But you know what you already have. And you know players like Guidetti will be better (in the future). They are young. That’s the kind of players we want to get in so we can progress as a team and hopefully get to that level we want to be at in Europe.

‘We want to try and get Guidetti to go through. Keeping Virgil and Kris, these are important.

There is always speculation over Virgil van Dijk, pictured training before Celtic's game against Dundee United

Kris Commons (centre) is also out of contract in the summer, so Deila is looking at keeping hold of him

‘We also have to look for players who can add to the squad and make them better. If we can do that then we will be in a better position in February than we are right now.

‘The negotiations (with Guidetti) are going on. There is progress all the time. We will see if we can get what we want. If we do, everyone will be happy.’

Rangers, Dundee and Inter Milan stand between Celtic and progress in the League Cup, Scottish Cup and Europa League in February while only four points now separates the champions from Dundee United and Aberdeen in the Premiership.

And, although optimistic for what the second segment of the season might hold, defeat at Tannadice last Sunday left the Norwegian casting a critical eye over what’s transpired under his watch so far.

Celtic are currently still in four competitions this season, and Deila would like to add one or two to his ranks

Guidetti has impressed on his loan move from Manchester City this season

‘When I see the possession and pressure we have and how we are controlling games, it is about getting possession into goal chances,’ he said.

‘With the potential we have, I would give us a five, six (out of 10) maybe.

‘We have a long way to go but it is quite good also.

‘This club is a sleeping bear. It is a huge club, we have so many talented players and good staff.

'We have just have to have the energy to work and progress, want to learn and get better. If you have that you can reach your goals.’

Meanwhile, Aleksander Tonev’s agent has claimed Werder Bremen were interested in ending the Bulgarian’s troubled spell at Celtic.

The on-loan Aston Villa winger’s appeal against his seven-game SFA ban for a racial slur on Aberdeen defender Shay Logan was thrown out last week.

Celtic have stood by Tonev and a deal to cut-short his time in Britain would be complicated by the fact they paid Villa a year’s loan fee in the summer.

Agent Nikolay Zheynov said: ‘Werder have again shown interest in him, but at this stage we don’t yet know whether the transfer will go through.’
