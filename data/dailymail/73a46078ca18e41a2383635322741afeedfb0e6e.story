The Port of Dover was closed overnight as armed police and staff simulated a terror attack, including mock explosions and gun fire.

The port was closed from midnight until 5am as a 'battle' took place between fake terrorists and police.

Explosions 
could be heard as mock bombs were detonated and blank rounds were fired by armed police as they took control back of the port during the 'attack'.

Kent Police said the exercise is the third and final part of a series of pre-planned exercises designed to protect the Port with a variety of emergency situations.

Police
 would not be drawn on whether the exercise was related to the recent 
influx of migrants trying to get to Dover from Calais.

French authorities are struggling to 
maintain order with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift camps and 
squats in and around the French town. Â 

So
 far this year in Calais the police have stopped 7,500 migrants who were
 trying to reach England and it's thought that by the end of the year 
30,000 will have been found hidden in vehicles.

The
 influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in 
Libya allowed migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan to reach Europe 
from the North African coast.

Armed
 gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage points from
 which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover.

Port authorities warned that mock explosions or sounds of gunfire may be heard, but reassured residents there is no cause for alarm

Tim
 Waggott, Chief Executive, Port of Dover, said: 'Such exercises, which 
we conduct from time to time with our partners, are extremely important 
in ensuring that we proactively prepare for any eventuality.

'As Europe's busiest ferry port, it is
 vital that we keep the safety and security of all those who work in and
 travel through the Port at the forefront of our operations.'

Superintendent Andrea Bishop, Kent Police, said: 'Dover is the gateway to the UK and Europe and one of the world's busiest ports.

Ambulances were on standby during the training exercise, which took place overnight until 5am

'Consequently, it's of huge strategic importance. Keeping the port safe and secure for the millions of people who travel through it or work there is a priority for us and our partners.

'Kent Police has the expertise and resources to ensure that people can go about their business safely but it's important that we periodically put those to the test.

'Such exercises are vital to make sure that we can effectively and professionally deal with potential incidents in the best way possible.'
