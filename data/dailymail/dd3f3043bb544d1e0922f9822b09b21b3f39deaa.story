A gay man has described how he was beaten and forced to jump off the side of a mountain to escape his attackers before falling 20 feet onto a ledge in the first hate crime trial of its kind in the U.S.

Kevin Pennington, 29, told federal jurors on Wednesday in London, Kentucky, that he didn't understand why Anthony Ray Jenkins and David Jason Jenkins kidnapped him and took him to a park to try to kill him in 2011.

'You're gonna die, you ... faggot! You deserve this!' Pennington said the men yelled at him while brutally punching and kicking him, Kentucky.com reports.

The cousins are charged with kidnapping, assault and committing a hate crime. They have pleaded not guilty.

On trial is whether the men attacked Pennington because of an anti-gay bias.

Defence attorneys have painted a detailed picture arguing otherwise.

'Mr Pennington does not come to this with clean hands,' Jenkins' attorney Andrew Stephens said in court on Wednesday.

The defence accused Pennington of being a drug dealer who lied early into the case by not revealing a planned deal before the attack, which Pennington has since acknowledged fearing it would outweigh his claims of his sexual orientation sparking the attack.

Anthony Jenkin's attorney, Stephens and Willis G Coffey, said Pennington was beaten up but not because of his sexual orientation.

'There was simply an argument that led to a fight because Jason was out of his head,' Coffey said according to Kentucky.com, accusing David 'Jason' Jenkins of having been drunk and on drugs at the time.

The attack in Kingdom Come State Park in April left Pennington with chest, head and other injuries after Pennington 
was invited to go on an evening drive with two women he knew: Alexis Leann 
Combs Jenkins and Mable 'Ashley' Jenkins.

Coffey said Pennington had agreed to buy Anthony Kenkin's sister Ashley a dose of Suboxone, a drug that can be used to get high while also to break drug dependency if in safe doses.

Ashley Jenkins testified having bought Suboxone from Pennington several times before the April attack.

Things got deadly when her brother suspected Pennington's drug source was a police informant, Coffey said, prompting their planned attack.

'They was going to take him up on the park and beat him to death,' Ashley Jenkins told the court of her brother and cousin.

She said the two cousins sat in the car wearing hoodies, turning their faces away from Pennington when he approached their vehicle so he wouldn't recognize them. When he did, he immediately wanted to be taken home, but was attacked.

Pennington told investigators that David Jenkins demanded a sexual favor from Pennington, which was refused.

Then the man said David Jenkins threatened to violently rape him, according to the affidavit.

The
truck stopped in the park because a tree had fallen across the road and
Anthony and David Jenkins pulled Pennington out of the truck and 
attacked him.

‘During the 
attack (the victim) was covering his face and they were all screaming 
`how do you like this fa****?'‘ the affidavit said.

Temporarily blacking out on a road, Pennington told the court he awoke to the men searching for a tire iron to continue the assault.

It was then he frantically raced over the mountain's side.

Pennington next ran to a ranger station, broke a window to get inside and called police.

Under Pennington's claims it's the first prosecution charging a violation of the sexual orientation section of the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed in 2009.

The women in the truck, Alexis Leann 
Combs Jenkins and Mable Ashley Jenkins, have been charged with 
kidnapping and aiding a kidnapping, authorities said.

‘The indictment marks the first federal case in the nation charging a violation of the sexual orientation section of the Federal Hate Crimes Law,’ said a U.S. Department of Justice statement.

‘It's vindicating to see that the years of hard work that went into making sure this law was on the books is now being put into place,’ said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign which pushed for the law's passage.

Drug motive: The defense said the attack was over a drug deal and not over Pennington's sexual orientation with Anthony Kenkin's sister Ashley expecting to buy a dose of Suboxone off Pennington on the night of the attack

‘The bigger picture here is that the U.S. attorney's office is sending a message that you don't try to hurt someone and you don't injure them because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,’ said Jordan Palmer, president of the Kentucky Equality Foundation, a civil-rights group that lobbied the Department of Justice to intervene in the case.

David Jenkins' lawyer claimed Jenkins knew Pennington and Jenkins denies that he committed a hate crime.

‘The hate crime component of this is just flat wrong,’ lawyer Andrew Stephens said.

‘I think it's very difficult to get into the mind of somebody and figure out what their intent is.’

Kerry Harvey, U.S. Attorney for Kentucky's Eastern District, said that a possible conviction on the hate crime charge could send the two men to prison for life.

He said the men used a truck and travelled on a federal highway with the victim, which allowed the case to fall under federal jurisdiction.

Even though Pennington was treated in a hospital for his physical injuries, he says he remains emotionally scarred from the attack.

Mr Palmer previously spoke with Pennington's mother and said she was pleased when she heard of the hate crime charges.

She had contacted the group just hours after the attack on Pennington, Palmer said.

‘I thought it was pretty sick when I heard about it,’ he said.

The law is known as the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Shephard was a gay college student killed in Wyoming in 1998.

‘The law was really meant as a backstop so that the resources of the federal government could be brought to bear when necessary to deal with these kinds of crimes,’ Mr Cole-Schwartz said.
