No one likes being upstaged at their own party, but for these 95 Chinese 'birthday twins' it was worth grinning and bearing it.

They brought more than 2,000 guests to a scenic park for what has been billed as the biggest mass birthday celebration in the country's history - including a 200ft-long cake.

The huge event even included live entertainment and hundreds of plates of fried food heaped along a table.

Save some for me! A Chinese park has held a massive birthday party for 95 people and 2,041 of their friends

Tuck in: The party included a 200ft-long birthday cake laid out on an enormous table for the guests

Party: Those celebrating were allowed to bring five friends and family each, unless they were over the age of 60

The party at the Chongdungou park in Luanchan, Henan Province, was open to anyone born on July 12 or July 13.

And they were allowed to bring give guests each - with over-60s allowed 10 guests each in recognition of their years, ShanghaiList reported.

The over-80s were especially lucky, bringing up to 30 of their friends each to gorge on the free food and huge quantities of cake.

In all, 2,136 people attended the party which was billed as China's largest ever.

Messy: It's claimed the event in Henan Province, China, was the largest of its kind ever held in the country

Moreish: Stacks upon stacks of cooked meat and vegetables were heaped upon the enormous table

Who's going first? The guests lined up in an orderly fashion alongside their communal cake before tucking in

But it was not the biggest birthday party in the world. The Guinness World Record is held by a 2012 bash in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, when a zoo found 228 people all born on July 4.

And it's claimed that record was thrashed by a party this year, which brought together 614 people born on January 26 to celebrate the 65th Indian Republic Day.

That record has not yet been officially recognised by Guinness.

Happy Birthday: The guests enjoyed live entertainment at the park - but the party was not the world's biggest

Fun: Over-80s were especially lucky, bringing 30 friends each to gorge on free food and huge quantities of cake
