Animation legend Joseph Barbera’s first ever cartoons which paved the way for Tom and Jerry, The Flintstones and Yogi Bear have gone on sale for £15,000. 

Barbera drew Kiko the Kangaroo in 1935 while working as a junior animator at the Terrytoons studio, home of Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg.

It was the first cartoon the young designer had written and storyboarded and was based around an aeroplane race between Kiko and a mustachioed dog called Dirty Doug.

The cartoon gave Barbera, who was just 24 at the time, the confidence to go into storytelling and as a result he formed a historic partnership with director William Hanna.

Together the pair created some of the most iconic cartoons ever made, also including The Jetsons, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and Huckleberry Hound.

Barbera had been working for cartoonist Paul Terry at his Terrytoons studio working on Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle when he attempted his first cartoon.

Amazingly, it was Terry’s indifference at Barbera’s creation that persuaded him to leave the company and join MGM, where he met Hanna.

The two formed Hanna-Barbera in 1957 and remained directors until their deaths.

Barbera died in Los Angeles in 2006 aged 95 while Hanna passed away in 2001 aged 90.

The sketches are being sold by Barbera’s nephew Larry, who was given them by Barbera’s mother Francesca.

They have been sketched using graphite and pencil on special animation paper, and measure 8ins by 6ins.

The 43 storyboards are tipped to fetch £15,000 when they go under the hammer.

Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions, said: 'The story of Joe Barbera’s first cartoon is a fascinating one.

'He was working in the clean-up department at Terrytoons when he decided he wanted to have a go at writing a story.

'So he sat down and drew a complete cartoon of Kiko the Kangaroo which was then shown to company boss Paul Terry.

'Terry took a look at the drawings, shrugged his shoulders and told Barbera to get back to work.

'Barbera knew he could write cartoon stories so at that point he decided to leave Terrytoons to join the newly formed MGM cartoon department.

'That’s when he met William Hanna and they began an historic partnership that created some of the world’s most famous cartoons.

'Had Paul Terry reacted differently to Barbera’s cartoon history could have worked out much differently.

'Joe Barbera was an incredible guy and a brilliant storyteller.

'In the 1940s and 50s when Disney was in its heyday, Tom and Jerry was winning Academy Awards.

'Barbera’s cartoons were so good they made it onto prime time television - he was effectively the Godfather of Saturday morning TV.

'This cartoon storyboard is very significant - it is the birthplace of some of the best and most historic cartoons ever made.

'It has been in the Barbera family ever since it was drawn.

'Animation is enjoying a renaissance now as the digital generation rediscovers these beautiful hand-drawn creations.'

The auction will take place at Heritage Auctions in Los Angeles on November 20.
