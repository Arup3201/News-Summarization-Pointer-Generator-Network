Terrified airline staff were forced to call animal rescuers after finding a massive snake on a plane.

The 18inch long reptile was spotted under a seat on a flight which had arrived from Cancun in Mexico.

The juvenile Middle American smooth-scaled racer was found on the plane at Glasgow Airport on Tuesday, echoing 2006 film Snakes on a Plane.

It is unclear if the reptile slithered onto the plane itself or if it escaped from someone’s hand luggage.

Staff from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were called and used a box to contain the snake.

The snake was taken to the charity’s animal rescue centre in Cardonald, Glasgow, where staff have named it Furtivo - Spanish for sneak.

SPCA senior inspector Billy Linton said: 'We have had the snake examined by a vet and, although we can’t be 100 per cent certain, we believe he is of the Dryadophis family, which are commonly referred to as American smooth-scaled racers.

'Racers aren’t venomous but, like all snakes, they can bite and Furtivo is very feisty. Although small at the moment, he is still a juvenile and has a lot of growing to do.'

Inspector Linton said staff at Glasgow Airport had 'remained remarkably calm' after finding the snake.

He said: 'I can only imagine that Furtivo managed to sneak his way onto the plane while it was waiting to take off in Cancun, although it is also possible he has hitched a lift in someone’s hand luggage.

'We have rescued several exotic creatures from international flights including scorpions, spiders, turtles and even giant land snails, so this isn’t as unusual as many people might think.

'Furtivo will remain in our care until we can find him an expert home with someone who has the necessary experience and knowledge to be able to look after such a creature.'

The discovery of Furtivo brings to mind the 2006 action movie Snakes on a Plane, in which an FBI Agent, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has to contend with a plane full of venomous snakes.

The film's B movie-esque title generated a lot of pre-release interest on the internet and fans had a lot of say in the movie's overall direction.

In an interview with New York Times Magazine, Jackson said he heard about the movie he called the director, David R. Ellis, and said, 'You doing a movie about snakes on a plane?' 'Yeah'. 'A plane full of poisonous snakes?' 'Yeah'. 'I’m down.'

At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel L. Jackson's request. In August 2005, the actor told an interviewer, 'We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title.'
