A diner who asked for a ‘doggy bag’ to take home her half-finished meal was surprised to be asked to sign a legal waiver.

The complicated form is being issued to customers at a restaurant part-owned by celebrity chef Raymond Blanc before they can take any of their food away with them.

Brasserie Blanc in Oxford refused to allow the diner to take home her unfinished tarte flambee – a pizza-style dish – before she agreed to indemnify them ‘from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damage, costs, charges, fines, penalties and expenses’ that could arise from her eating it at home.

The restaurant said the document was designed to stop diners from suing it if they took the £11.80 dish home, failed to store or refrigerate it properly and became ill. But managers admitted they had never been sued.

Sarah Hesketh, 31, from North London, said: ‘I was having Sunday lunch with my boyfriend and didn’t manage to finish my main course, so thought I’d take it away to eat on my way home.

‘But when I asked the waitress to wrap it up she said I had to sign a waiver. I did it without thinking, but the more I thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed. It is a completely pointless bit of paperwork. I only wanted to take away the tart that I was already eating.’

Written in convoluted legalistic jargon – and bad English – the ‘indemnity form’ asks diners to ‘confirm that I will be taking away [the food or drink] into the house/home (“the premises”) for the consumption (“function”)’.

It continues: ‘I and my guests will then be able to consumer [sic] this food or drink.’ But the diner must fulfil two requirements.

Firstly, they must ‘ensure that all applicable licensing laws are complied with’ and ‘ensure that no sales of liquor are made on the premises’.

Secondly, they must: ‘Observe and comply with all legal requirements relating to food and its preparation, food safety and health and safety, together with any other requirements affecting catering premises and/or premises for the preparation of food (as defined by the Food Safety Act 1990, whether statutory or otherwise) and all new relating Regulation.’

Brasserie Blanc said the form is a standard one provided by environmental health officers and used by many restaurants. A spokesman said: ‘Although we don’t have to use it, staff are strongly recommended to as we don’t have a licence to serve takeaway food.’

Restaurant critic Richard Harden, co-founder of Harden’s London Restaurants guides, said: ‘I would never ask for a doggy bag in the first place. But even if I were to, I don’t see the use of this form.

‘I’ve never heard of such a thing. This is just more nonsense designed to interfere with the operation of common sense.’
