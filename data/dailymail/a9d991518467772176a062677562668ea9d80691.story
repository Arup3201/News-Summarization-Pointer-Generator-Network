Mamadou Sakho believes he has the leadership skills to help solve Liverpool's defensive woes.

The French 24-year-old, who captained Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 17, has missed Liverpool's last 10 games due to a thigh injury.

The Reds defence has proved shaky this season having kept just two clean sheets in the last 17 games.

And Sakho is ready to provide some much-needed authority at the back when he makes his expected return against Crystal Palace on November 23.

Sakho told the Daily Mirror: 'For me it (leadership) comes naturally.

'There are different kinds of leaders, technical leaders, dressing-room leaders, psychological leaders.

'But I am a very ambitious person.

'I have set personal objectives. The team has set some too and they are quite similar.'
