Primary school children were more familiar with Foster's lager brand than other consumer products

Primary school children recognise the Foster’s lager brand more easily than other consumer products, a survey shows.

The Australian brewery giant, which uses two humorous beach characters in its TV ads, was immediately recognised as a drinks brand by 93 per cent of youngsters aged ten and 11.

That was higher than the 87 per cent who recognised McCoy’s as a food product, the 86 per cent who immediately knew McVitie’s were biscuits and the 84 per cent for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. 

The same study found that half – 47 per cent – of primary school age children associate Carlsberg beer with the English national football team, where it is the official sponsor.

Similarly, almost six in ten boys associated Chang beer with Everton football club, which is the club shirt sponsor.

There was a similar story in Scotland where almost half of children and 60 per cent of boys correctly associated Carling with the Scottish national football team. The brand sponsored the Scottish Football Association until 2014.

The figures come from alcohol campaigners and academics who claim they are evidence of a need for radical new controls on the way alcohol is marketed to protect children.

This would include a ban on advertising on TV before the 9pm watershed, a phased end to the sponsorship of major sporting events and teams, plus restrictions on cinema advertising.

The survey of more than 800 primary school children in England and Scotland looked at the recognition of alcohol brands, alcohol sponsorship, TV and social media use, and whether they had tried alcohol.

At the same time as 93 per cent of youngsters knew Foster’s was a lager brand, four in five recognised the characters ‘Brad and Dan’ from its TV commercial.

The humour is particularly appealing to teenage boys with one commercial featuring a beach volleyball game and young women in skimpy bikinis.

In others, they are seen dispensing ‘agony uncle’ advice from a hut on a golden sandy beach to young British men, including guidance on whether a girlfriend is likely to end up looking like her mother.

The commercials have been hugely successful in financial terms with some industry experts suggesting that for every £1 spent on the adverts, Foster’s sold an extra £32 of beer.

However, health campaigners say this success is also spilling over to attract youngsters to the brand and the idea of drinking.

An expert in marketing and its effects on children, Professor Gerard Hastings, said: ‘This research shows that alcohol marketing is clearly making an impression on our children.

‘Existing evidence shows that exposure to alcohol marketing leads young people to start drinking at an earlier age and to drink more.

‘As the Six Nations rugby kicks off with Guinness as its “official beer”, thousands of children across the UK will once again see alcohol associated with a major sporting event.’

The professor is the founder of the Institute of Social Marketing at the University of Stirling and has also advised the government on the issue of advertising and children.

New research from the Alcohol Health Alliance shows high public support for better protection for children and young people from alcohol marketing.

More than half – 58 per cent – said they supported restrictions on drinks firms sponsoring sporting events and a higher 74 per cent wanted a ban on TV advertising before 9pm.

More than eight in ten – 84 per cent- believe alcohol advertising in cinemas should only be shown if films have an 18 certificate.

The groups Alcohol Concern, Balance North East, Drink Wise and Alcohol Focus Scotland have come together to call for these measures to be implemented.

Head of Policy at Alcohol Concern, Tom Smith, said: ‘This research shows just how many of our children are being exposed to alcohol marketing, with an even bigger impact being made on those children with an interest in sport.

‘Children get bombarded with pro-drinking messages, when the turn on the TV, go to the cinema or walk down the road, and the existing codes are failing to protect them.’

While Foster’s is promoted as Australian it is actually made in Manchester by the Dutch company Heineken.

The British Beer & Pub Association, which speaks for brewers, said drinking across all age groups, including the young is falling. It said the UK already has strict controls ensuring marketing is not directed to children.

Chief executive, Brigid Simmonds, said: ‘Any objective look at this issue would highlight that alcohol consumption in the UK is sharply down, by 18 per cent since 2004, and drinking among young people is also down.

‘Advertising designed to achieve brand differentiation does not encourage irresponsible consumption, nor is it aimed at young people.

‘And if we want more young people to get active, why pursue policies that would undermine sports sponsorship? Around £300million comes from alcohol sponsorship, with some £50million going directly to grassroots sport.’
