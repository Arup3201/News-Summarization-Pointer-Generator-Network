Mothers can reduce the chances of having fussy eaters by eating plenty of vegetables during pregnancy

The parental crusade to get children to eat fruit and vegetables should begin before birth, researchers said last night.

Pregnant women with a varied diet are less likely to give birth to fussy eaters, they said, and babies are more accepting of foods mothers eat regularly while expectant and breast-feeding.

In one study, children whose mothers often drank carrot juice ate twice as much carrot-flavoured cereal when being weaned.

Researcher Dr Julie Mennella from the Monell Centre in Philadelphia said: ‘The research clearly shows that if mothers eat a lot of fruit during lactation and pregnancy, then their child will be much more open to eating fruit during weaning. The same goes with vegetables.

‘Babies are biologically hardwired to be attracted to foods containing sugar and salt, but may not be attracted to bitter foods such as green vegetables.

'They have to be exposed to fruit and vegetables if they are to learn to like these flavours.

‘The good news is our research shows babies can learn very early on about healthy foods,’ she said.

‘The message is, eat the healthy food you enjoy and when the baby is old enough to start weaning they will be familiar with those flavours.’

In her research, discussed at the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference, Dr Mennella tested 46 babies aged between six months and a year for their liking of carrot-flavoured cereal.

PUGH

Those whose mothers drank carrot juice several times a week consumed more than 80g of the cereal, compared with only 44g in other babies.

‘It shows how we are primed by our earliest exposures,’ said Dr Mennella.

‘Children get sensory information in the womb and through their mothers’ milk.’

Dr Mennella also found that bottle-fed babies quickly accept fruit and vegetables if they are given them when they start eating solids.

In another test, green beans were given to babies for eight days.

On the first day, they ate an average of 50g of beans, but over eight days their consumption increased to 80g.

‘Regardless of if a child is breast or bottle-fed, it can still learn as soon as it starts to wean. If they are repeatedly exposed to fruit and vegetables, they soon begin to accept these foods,’ said Dr Mennella.

‘By age two, there is no reason a child should not have the same varied diet as an adult.’

She said hiding broccoli in brownies was not the answer, as children need to learn to like the taste of vegetables independently of other flavours.

Volatile chemicals make homegrown tomatoes taste sweeter

Scientists have identified the key chemicals that makes homegrown tomatoes taste so much sweeter than the supermarket varieties.

They claim adding more ‘volatiles’ which
enhance the perception of sweetness to commercially-grown tomatoes will
make them more appealing to the public and help increase consumption.

And in the future they hope to use the 
chemicals to replace sugar in foods and fruit juices to make them 
healthier and less calorific.

Harry Klee from the University of 
Florida said: ‘There are a set of these volatile components that really 
enhance the perception of sweetness.

'It is really interesting because 
smell is not meant to influence taste because they are completely 
different systems, but it does.

‘In theory we could take a fruit juice, 
remove a bunch of the sugar, replace it with these volatile chemicals 
and greatly reduce the caloric content of that juice, or any food for 
that matter, and make it a healthier product without altering our 
perception of how sweet it is.’
