A New York City science teacher has pleaded not guilty to repeatedly molesting at least nine elementary school girls in Brooklyn.

Omil Carrasquillo, 36, entered the plea at his arraignment Monday. He was released on $200,000 bail and is due back in court February 6.

The alleged victims, all students at The Caton School PS 249 in Brooklyn, were between ages 9-11. Carrasquillo was originally arrested in September for allegedly fondling four girls, but investigators have since identified five more victims.

Bad teacher: Omil Carrasquillo, 36, pictured left in court Monday and right with his wife, Dana, is accused of molesting nine girls at his Brooklyn elementary school 

The incidents allegedly took place at The Caton School PS 249 in Kensington section of Brooklyn 

Carrasquillo, a US Army veteran, lives in Selden, Long Island, with his 33-year-old wife, Dana, and their 7-year-old son.

According to prosecutors, the encounters between the teacher and his young students occurred between 2013 and September of this year, when school officials learned of the allegations against Carrasquillo and removed him from the school.

Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson says the defendant was 'an alleged predator who surrounded himself with vulnerable victims.' 

During his arraignment Monday, Carrasquillo's defense attorney told the judge his client was not a flight risk because he had served in the military. 

Investigators say the incidents involved the married teacher touching the girls' private parts and rubbing their breasts and buttocks, reported 7Online.

‘These allegations are disturbing, and we removed Mr. Carrasquillo immediately: He is not near any students. We are investigating the matter and supporting this school community,’ the New York City Department of Education said in a statement.

After his arrest in September, Carrasquillo allegedly told police he ‘gives and receive hugs from his students,’ but conceded that some of his touches could be misinterpreted, reported the New York Daily News.

‘Mr. Carrasquillo states that he will give the girls and boys a hug if they have done something good or they will come to him and hug,’ a police report stated.

The teacher also said that sometimes he would place a hand on a student’s back or shoulder while explaining classwork, and also he would touch the kids on their legs or arms to draw their attention.

'Upstanding citizen': Carrasquillo, pictured left and right, was hired as a teacher in 2006 after retiring from the US Army and the National Guard 

Carrasquillo resigned from his post at the Brooklyn school in September after eight years on the job.

He is currently facing nearly two dozen counts of sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child.

According to the disgraced educator’s attorney, Anthony La Pinta, his client was honorably discharged from the Army in 2000 and then volunteered for the National Guard.

He spent a month working at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks and also coached athletes for the Special Olympics.
