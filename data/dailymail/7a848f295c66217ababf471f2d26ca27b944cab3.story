Prostitutes in one of Brazil's biggest cities are signing up for free English classes ahead of this year's Confederations Cup and the 2014 World Cup.

Cida Vieira, president of the Association of Prostitutes in the city of Belo Horizonte, has said 20 women have already signed up for the courses.

She expects at least 300 of the group's 4,000 members to follow suit. The association is seeking volunteer teachers as it organises the English language classes.

She said: 'I don't think we will have problems persuading English teachers to provide services for free.

'We already have several volunteer psychologists and doctors helping us.'

She said classes are expected to begin in March and last up to eight months.

The 62,000-seat Mineirao Stadium in the south eastern city of Belo Horizonte, will host three matches of the Confederations Cup and six games of the World Cup.

She said: 'It will be important for the girls who will be able to use English to let their clients know what they are charging and learn about what turns them on.'

'And for the same reasons we are also thinking of offering free French and Italian classes,' she added.

Prostitution is legal in Brazil.
