It has long been regarded as the most important meal of the day. 

And now it seems that the traditional full English breakfast is back on the menu for a rising number of British people. 

New research has shown that people are choosing to kick-start the day with an old fashioned fry-up - commonly referred to as 'The Full Monty' because former British Army officer Field Marshal Montgomery was particularly fond of the classic breakfast.

The traditional English breakfast has enjoyed a renaissance in the last year, with eggs doing especially well 

The data from Kantar Worldpanel, a company dealing in consumer knowledge, showed that eggs featured in 804.6million breakfasts at home - up 13.7 per cent year on year. 

Servings of bacon and sausages also increased, by 7.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. 

Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'The cooked breakfast is experiencing a renaissance.

'Over the past six months, Brits served up elements of the classic Full Monty - such as eggs, bacon, sausages and beans - on 142.4million more occasions than they did a year earlier. That’s an uplift of 9.8 per cent.

'These figures will surprise many as the 
resurgence of cooked items contradicts received wisdom that fewer of us 
eat a proper breakfast at home these days.'

Interestingly, the research showed that increasing numbers of people are cooking smaller breakfasts, more often with one element of the classic fry up, with eggs doing particularly well.  

Andew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council said: 'If consumers are looking for unprocessed, natural and healthy breakfast options, eggs are the ideal option as they are a rich and natural source of high quality protein, vitamins and minerals.'

Similar eating patterns are also benefiting the other breakfast favourites, bacon and sausages. 

A spokesman for Bpex, the pig levy board, said: 'Although bacon and sausages are more popular at weekends, the fastest growth has come from weekday breakfasts.' 

Sophie Flacks, of Kantar Worldpanel, said: 'Filling up at the start of the day is becoming very important to consumers, with an extra 366 million breakfast choices over the past six months being motivated by the need for a filling option.'
