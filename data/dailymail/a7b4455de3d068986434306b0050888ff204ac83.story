Roy Hodgson claims his highlight of 2014 was being applauded by England supporters following the national team’s disastrous World Cup showing in Brazil.

Hodgson made his way over to the travelling support after the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in England’s final group game in Belo Horizonte, and was surprised by their reaction.

The England head coach, whose team finished bottom of Group D without a single win, was saluted with his players for their efforts.

The support of the England fans was passionate despite yet another disappointing tournament 

Hodgson said: ‘If there was one highlight of the year which really totally revived my faith in the average man’s appreciation of football and his desire to support his team, then it would be the experience in Belo Horizonte.

‘We played 0-0 against Costa Rica. We then went to the fans to thank them — really probably expecting them to not be terribly grateful for our thanks — and the reception we got there was really quite incredible.

‘I think if you said to me “tell me one thing in 2014 that’s had a major effect on your life” I would say that.’

Hodgson claims England’s six-game unbeaten run since the World Cup has got the country back on side as he sets his sights on Euro 2016 in France. ‘Fortunately we’ve managed to redress the balance somewhat since the World Cup.

‘Obviously the team has been even further renewed. We lost one or two senior players.

‘That’s forced us to look at what’s available and many of the players available these days are the younger ones and luckily they’ve repaid our faith in them during this autumn period. I’m pleased that the team is playing some good football and showing signs of a bright future.’
