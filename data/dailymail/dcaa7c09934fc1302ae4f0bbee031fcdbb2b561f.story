When Ros Green first saw The Chapel at Rendham, near Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, she decided to buy it on the spot. ‘Admittedly I was pregnant and jet-lagged,’ says Ros, ‘but I thought it was wonderful. I loved the pillars inside and managed to ignore all the problems.’

Ros, who had been brought up in Suffolk, had just flown in from Australia, where she had been raising her first two children with her partner, Douglas Hunter.

By the time Douglas arrived from Australia the deal was done. He turned up to find he was the owner of an enormous dilapidated building with holes in the roof, broken windows and a sea of pews. He said only one word. ‘Why?’

The Chapel at Rendham, near Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, a five-bedroom converted home - still with altar platform and pulpit - is on the market for £695,000

But there was another shock in store for Douglas – one that he could never have predicted. While his mother, over on a visit from the other side of the world, was looking through some old documents at the chapel, she made an amazing discovery: she found that it had been built with money from one of their ancestors.

‘I’m actually a fifth generation New Zealander,’ says Douglas. ‘I didn’t know of any family connection with Suffolk so it was a spooky surprise when we discovered it.’

The ancestor in question was Dr Isaac Watts, a prolific hymn-writer, whose most well-known works include Joy To The World and Our God, Our Help In Ages Past.

The chapel had been built in 1750 with the help of a generous donation from Dr Watts. Watts was a nonconformist and the chapel, before it was deconsecrated in 1979 because of dwindling congregations, was a United Reformed church. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, is said to have often visited it in the 18th Century.

When Douglas and Ros bought it 23 years ago, the chapel had been empty for more than a decade. ‘We never planned to buy a wreck or a chapel,’ says Ros. ‘But my mother was keen for us to come to Suffolk and knew we wouldn’t be seduced by an ordinary house, so when she spotted this chapel for sale she sent us the details.’

The scale of the work required was overwhelming and they had to do a lot before they could move in. Luckily, Ros’s parents live nearby and they stayed with them for six months.

The chapel had to be re-roofed and the whole building re-plumbed. Once the basics were done, they moved in and did everything else, including finding furniture at auctions, bit by bit.

The chapel is now a wonderfully spacious family home, with a vast main living space with 20ft high ceilings and a wide gallery on three sides. The big kitchen, which was once the school room, has doors out on to the large garden (the headstones have been moved to a garden of remembrance opposite).

The ground-floor bathroom, once the vestry, has a beautiful roll-top bath and the antique lamp fixed to the wall was given to Ros and Douglas by someone who knew it had originally come from the chapel.

Dr Isaac Watts composed many popular hymns, including Joy To The World

At the other end of the chapel from the kitchen, a wall has been put in to slice off space for Ros and Douglas’s bedroom and en suite shower. Two other bedrooms are on the ground floor, and upstairs, in the corners of the gallery, are two more rooms, one of which is used as a bedroom and the other a study.

Interestingly, from the outside the chapel looks like a handsome red-brick house – its history is revealed only when you step inside.

Douglas and Ros both work in the arts, as events producers and consultants, and their two daughters are both artists. So it’s not surprising that the walls are covered in art and the house is full of quirky pieces picked up here and there.

But what makes the chapel extra special is that, unlike most conversions, the altar platform and rail and pulpit are still in situ.

The platform is the perfect spot for the baby grand piano, where eldest daughter Lily plays and composes. A link, perhaps, to her hymn-writing ancestor.

The whole family agree that the chapel has given them a very happy home for the past 23 years.

But now that the three children – Felix, 25, Lily, 24, and Angelica, 22 – have flown the coop, the couple have put it on the market at £695,000.

‘It’s wasted without a family,’ says Ros. ‘The children had a fantastic time growing up here: there was so much space for them to run around and all their friends would come here. It was always full of children.’

They used to hold Nativity plays on Christmas Eve for the whole village, and always have an enormous 20ft Christmas tree.

‘I did feet slightly guilty converting a chapel into somewhere to live,’ says Ros, ‘so it was nice to keep those traditions. People in the village have a connection to this place – we used to have people coming here looking for their family pews.’

Where will they go when the chapel is sold? ‘We want something that’s ours and unique,’ says Ros. ‘What we plan to do is buy a plot of land and build a sustainable straw bale house. We couldn’t live somewhere ordinary now.’
