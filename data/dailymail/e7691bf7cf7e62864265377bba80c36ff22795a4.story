MPs and ministers are preaching the public about the need to eat healthily while helping to chomp through 100,000 chocolate bars in Parliament every year.

Kit Kats, Twix bars and Snickers are revealed as the biggest sellers in the cafes, shops and bars in the Houses of Parliament, with almost 200,000 sales of confectionery and sweets in the last two years.

Health campaigners raised concerns about the 'astronomical amount' of chocolate sold by lawmakers and their staff.

New figures show how in 2013 and 2014 almost 200,000 chocolate bars were sold, including 40,000 Kit Kats, 23,300 Twix and 18,200 Snickers bars

David Cameron once railed against shops selling cheap chocolate at their checkouts, blaming He WH Smith for fuelling the obesity crisis with half-price Chocolate Oranges instead of real oranges.

The Prime Minister has also spoken of his battle with his own weight, moving to cut out bread to shed the pounds.

And just last week he suggested obese people should be refused out-of-work benefits.

But details have emerged of the scale of the chocolate addiction in the corridors of power.

Information on sales of chocolate and sweets in the Houses of Parliament were released under Freedom of Information laws.

In 2013 and 2014 there were 199,966 items of confectionery sold, according to the Sunday Times.

More Kit Kats were sold than any other snack, totalling more than 39,000 in two years, including almost 2,000 Kit Kat Chunkys and more than 3,100 dark chocolate versions.

The second most popular was Twix, selling more than 23,300, followed by Snickers (18,235), Maltesers (14,150) and Mars bars (13,916).

Crunchies, Galaxy, Bounty bars, Yorkies and Picnics complete the top 10 most popular chocolate bars in Parliament..

Health campaigners said politicians should 'lead by example' and not indulge in so much chocolate

Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum charity, said the 'astronomical amount' of sweets and chocolate sold in Parliament suggested politicians had a sugar habit 'that should be kicked in the can'.

He told the Sunday Times that 'nobody should be denied a treat', but added: 'This is no example to give the electorate. Members of parliament should lead by example.'

A letter sent to every MP and peer last year ordered them to measure their waistline in an attempt to get Parliament to set an example to the nation.

They were urged to check that their waist is less than half their height - a key indicator of having a healthy weight.

Former surgeon Lord McColl of Dulwich stalks the corridors of power to put pressure on Labour, Tory and Lib Dem members who he accuses of 'eating too much of the gross national product'.

Lord McColl said overweight politicians could not be seen lecturing the public on their eating habits.

'I think the whole nation is at fault. We have got to get the whole nation moving on this.

'It looks bad if politicians are telling the people what to do and they are not doing it themselves.'

A Commons spokesman said: 'The House of Commons is keen to promote healthy eating to all those who work on or visit the estate and who use the catering facilities.

'For example, at our 'Wellbeing Day' events healthy eating is strongly promoted. Our menus rate dishes for fat content using a traffic light system.'
