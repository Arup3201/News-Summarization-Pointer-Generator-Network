A father and son who spent six years building a 38ft luxury yacht in their back garden had to hire a crane to hoist it over their own house after discovering it was too big to get out.

Roofing business owner John Couzens, 53, and his 26-year-old son Dan worked up to 12 hours a day to finish the eight tonne boat worth £175,000 which boasts showers and two bedrooms.

But when they found it was too heavy to wheel out of their 25ft high work shed, they invited the neighbours in Broadstairs, Kent, to watch the 15ft high vessel being lifted over their home.

The father-of-four said watching the Evolution 38i boat, named Out Of The Blue, hovering over the roof of his £300,000 four-bedroom house  was a moment he will never forget.

'There was a moment when I thought - this could all go horribly wrong,' he said.

'It was so ridiculous watching it appear over the top of the house. But it was an incredible moment as well.

He decided to create the 38ft by 5ft boat from scratch in a bid to give his 26-year-old son a project to focus on.

A team of 10 construction workers helped transport the eight tonne boat worth more than £175,000

To get the hull into the garden they constructed scaffolding and built a 25ft high work shed

The finished boat was rolled out of the specially-constructed shed and was lifted by a crane

Now moored in Ramsgate Harbour, the boat will have to undergo a number of safety checks

Mr Couzens said the next big moment for the family will be taking it out to sea in a few months

'Dan is one of these people who is just so gifted and whatever he puts his mind to he completes,' he said.

'He doesn't drink much and he has all this excess energy, so when he told me he needed a project six years ago we decided to think of something big.

'He had fixed up cars in the past but it was all over very quickly.

Now moored in Ramsgate Harbour, the boat will have to undergo a number of safety checks and sea lessons before it can set sail.

'Getting it into the water was another momentous step because it didn't sink,' said the 53-year-old.

'We think it will take another four months to get everything sorted in terms of life-jackets and safety precautions.

'The next big moment for us as a family will be getting it out to sea.

The duo spent two years building a boat house measuring 45ft by 18ft in the back garden

Dan Couzens,  26, stood on the back of the luxury yacht which he spent six years building

'You can sleep on it, eat on it and live on it, so hopefully we can have some wonderful times on it.

'I'm incredibly proud of Dan for his unwavering dedication to the project, it's been an amazing journey.'

The duo first conceived the project in 2008 and took an eight-hour trip to Cornwall where they discovered the Evolution 38i hull. 

Realising they would need a would need a large indoor space to build the yacht, they set about constructing a boat house which measured 45 ft by 18ft.

'We were immediately blown away by it and so the process began,' said Mr Couzens.

'Getting the hull into the garden was a mission in itself and involved scaffolding and building a boat house.

'My wife Alison had to put up with that boat house for six years so I've promised her now it's in the water she can have a new kitchen.' 

Trained in lead, bronze and brass work, the duo spent months perfecting their project and the boat is now installed with a 500 horse power Cummins 8.3L diesel engine.

Mr Couzens said: 'Dan's workmanship is amazing. He would be up for breakfast at 7:30, start work at 8, have a tea break at 10, lunch at 12, another tea break at 3 and then finish for dinner at 5.

'Everything is designed so intricately and there are so many features that are completely his design. It's a work of art.'

The pair eventually completed the project on Wednesday and couldn't wait to take it to the seas at the marina in Ramsgate, Kent

They started looking at boat manufacturers straight away and took an eight-hour trip to Cornwall where they discovered the Evolution 38i hull
