A new business is being launched for 
people around the globe who want to travel - albeit virtually - into space.

Students Alex Baker and Chris Rose from Sheffield are launching low-cost space missions, taking 
light-weight payloads including people's photographs, billboard-style adverts and even cakes soaring into the stratosphere for a fraction of 
the cost of NASA and Virgin Galactic flights.

The
prototype balloon costs just £350 and is fitted with a camera that can beam back images of the Earth's stratosphere.

Sheffield graduates Chris Rose, right, and Alex Baker are offering £350 space missions. A 1.5kg capsule is attached to a helium balloon, pictured, and is capable of reaching altitudes of 23 miles. It can carry photos of people or adverts and a built-in camera can takes images high above the Earth 

The capsules weigh just over 1.5kg and is about the size of a lunchbox.

A helium balloon carries the capsule into the stratosphere reaching an altitude of as much as 37.6km .

GPS coordinates are sent to the user's mobile phone and cameras can be remotely taken before the balloon deflates and the craft descends with a 
parachute.

A memory card on board the balloon-assisted spacecraft for the 
University of Sheffield campaign recently carried the names of more than 2,000 
University of Sheffield students, prospective students, alumni and 
academics. 

The students have fine-tuned their design to 
allow space enthusiasts to send their own messages into orbit and capture their
own images for the same bargain price.

Baker, 28, and Rose, 27, sent up their first homemade device in 2011 with a styrofoam box 
containing a cheap camera lifted by a helium balloon.

They tracked its progress on a GPS device, which responded to a phone call by texting back its coordinates.

So far the balloon has reached altitudes of more than 23 miles (37km) which is twice the 
height of the so-called Armstrong limit - an altitude beyond which humans
can't survive in an unpressurized environment.

'It’s a hobby that has really caught the imagination,' said Baker. 

'The space shuttle programme cost $200 billion, so getting our 
spacecraft to 37km for 350 quid feels amazing and quite a bargain.'

Manned missions are not currently on the agenda but the team are 
learning quickly and breaking altitude records each time they send a 
capsule up. 

The team meet regularly to fine-tune the equipment at Baker's Sheffield home, dubbed Mission Control.

Chris Rose and Alex Baker using a camera fitted to their  space 
balloon. The capsule has already reached altitudes of 23 miles and the 
pair are hoping to reach higher

The capsules weigh just over 1.5kg, are about the size of a lunchbox, 
and rise into the stratosphere reaching an altitude of as much as 37.6 
kilometres before the balloon deflates and the craft descends with a 
parachute.

Chris said: “We are providing the kit for non-specialists for their own space mission.

'The set-up is very intuitive and easy to understand. We
sent a cake into space to celebrate a web design company’s tenth 
anniversary, so anything can be attached to the aircraft if it is light 
enough.

'The highest we 
have reached so far is 23 miles, but with technology advancing we are 
hoping to get higher and higher as time goes on.'

SentIntoSpace.com
gets off the ground at the start of October with the standard kit 
costing £350 and users can install their own video camera.

Customers can send anything such as messages to loved ones and advertising campaigns.

Chris added: 'The sky is the limit for us when we launch in October and we hope our business takes off.'

People will be able to buy starter kits to send their own messages and photos from SentIntoSpace.com in October. The standard kit costs £350 and users can install their own video camera

The students have now turned their attention to a campaign for the 
University of Sheffield called 'Go Higher' aimed at attracting students 
to upgrade to a place at Sheffield during this year’s Clearing process.

'The University has seen more than its share of high fliers', continued Baker, 'including astronauts, Red Arrows pilots and more, so it’s fitting for 
us to be launching a campaign that’s all about reaching for the stars.'

Rose said: 'We might not be in a position to 
rival NASA or Virgin Galactic yet, but we hope it’s just a matter of 
time. 

'When you look at the cost of a Virgin Galactic ticket ($250,000) 
and compare it with cost of sending a picture of your dad who’s always 
wanted to go into space up with us, there’s a good case for flying with 
us.'
