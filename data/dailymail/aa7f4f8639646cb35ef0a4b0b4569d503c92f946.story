Too much: Michael Mansfield QC, pictured, was told to calm down his questioning of a witness at the Mark Duggan inquest

A top barrister was told to calm down after he was accused of being ‘too combative and aggressive’ during his questioning of a witness yesterday.

In a highly unusual move, the 11 jury members passed a note to the judge expressing their alarm over the conduct of Michael Mansfield, QC, at the inquest into Mark Duggan.

Judge Keith Cutler interrupted Mr Mansfield during his aggressive questioning of a senior police officer and told him to calm down.

The judge said: ‘I’m concerned that you are getting much too combative and much too aggressive. That is the note I’ve got from the jury.

‘I think that it would be better if we had a very calm, considered investigation.’

Mr Mansfield, a leading Left-wing barrister who has represented a string of high-profile clients, spent several hours yesterday questioning Acting Superintendent Michael Foote about his role in Duggan’s shooting, which sparked the 2011 summer riots.

In scenes reminiscent of a TV courtroom drama, Mr Mansfield often shouted his questions at the officer when he failed to get the response he was looking for.

During the hostile interrogation, Hugo Keith, the QC representing the Metropolitan Police, repeatedly rose to his feet to object to the style of questioning. Judge Cutler also interrupted Mr Mansfield on several occasions before finally warning him to calm down.

The aggressive line of questioning directed towards Mr Foote - an officer with 29 years of experience - was continued by human rights barrister Leslie Thomas, who also represents Duggan’s family.

During his questioning Mr Thomas told the court that police have to take heed of Article 2 of the Human Rights legislation which states that everyone has a right to life.

He told Mr Foote: ‘Even criminals have rights. You know that each subject has a right to life.’ Judge Cutler then admonished Mr Thomas for ‘giving a speech on the law’ instead of asking relevant questions.

The aggressive cross examination by both Mr Mansfield and Mr Thomas focused on the three days leading up to the fatal shooting of Duggan in Tottenham, north London, on August 4, 2011.

The father-of-four, who had taken the party drug Ecstasy, was shot twice by a police marksman as he ran out of a Toyota minicab.

Officers who confronted Duggan claim he was holding a gun when he was shot. A pistol was later recovered up to 20 feet away from Duggan’s body.

Duggan, a member of the notorious Tottenham ManDem gang, is alleged to have picked up a handgun from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, 15 minutes before he was shot.

Mr Foote, who was in charge of the Met’s gang unit in north-west London, was repeatedly asked why his team did not seize the gun off Hutchinson-Foster before he passed it to Duggan.

The officer told the Royal Courts of Justice that the reason officers did not intervene earlier was because they did not know where the gun was being stored.

He added: ‘If we knew [Hutchinson-Foster] had it in his possession then we would have [taken action], but we didn’t have that type of specific intelligence.’ Mr Foote said the reason it was so important to get guns off the streets was to

prevent ‘innocent members of the public from being caught up in gang feuds’.

He highlighted the shooting of Thusha Kamaleswaran, who was five years old when she was left paralysed by a bullet fired a gangster as she danced in a grocery store aisle in front of her parents in Stockwell, south London.

He added: ‘They are the sort of incidents that we are trying to prevent.’ At one point Mr Mansfield claimed the Duggan operation was badly planned and inadequately supervised.

Mr Foote said: ‘In my view the operation was properly planned. This is something we do on a regular basis. In these type of operations, subjects that are under observation lead chaotic lifestyles.

‘Sometimes they don’t do what you expect them to do. We are reacting to spontaneous events.’
