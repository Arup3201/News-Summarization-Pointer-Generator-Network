A police officer loses his cool and tells a protester to stop rioting because he has known him since he was a boy - in a dramatic exchange during the height of the Ferguson unrest.

Officer Greg Casem screamed at the man in his 20s to stop destroying the community they both grew up in.

He was unable to contain his emotion and, as his voice cracked, he said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro... 25 years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’

The extraordinary moment - captured in pictures which have come to light today - gives an insight into how hard it has been for Ferguson police to watch their own city burn.

These exclusive photos were taken on the second night of unrest after a grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Offcer Greg Casem comes close to cracking during the riots as he comes faces to face with a demonstrator who he had known since childhood 

'You’re killing us! We’re not killing y’all, so stop killing us!’ the 20-something protesters shouted. Officer Casem said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro. A long time. Since you were this big [moving hand to waist height]’.

The confrontation shows the toll on officers of the riots in a community where some have served for many years

'Twenty five years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’ the officer said as he came close to tears

Officer Casem, who was not wearing full protective gear, has served in Ferguson for 25 years

He shot dead Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, on August 9 sparking violent unrest that returned last week when no indictment was handed down.

Rioters smashed up most of the historic downtown street and burned more than a dozen buildings during a night of mayhem.

During the violence last Tuesday they also set alight to a police car and smashed the windows of City Hall during skirmishes around the Ferguson police station.

Immediately afterwards officer Casem got into the row with the protester as he pointed to the carnage in front of him.

He said: ‘Look at that, look at that!'

The protester screamed in his face: ‘How you guna help? How you guna help?’

Officer Casem replied: ‘How are these families guna eat? How are they guna get their diapers?’

In flames: The confrontation was the night after these scenes of destruction in the suburb of St Louis, Missouri, which came after the acquittal of Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown

Gutted: Businesses in the town were badly hit, including this beauty outlet in a strip mall. Officer Casem was upset at the impact on the community of the riots and how it would struggle to rebuild

Alight: This was one of the businesses set on fire by looters and rioters in Ferguson after the grand jury cleared officer Wilson

Destruction: The suburb is now having to rebuild after the orgy of destruction which hit it

The protester moved closer to his face and shouted: ‘You’re killing us! We’re not killing y’all, so stop killing us!’

Officer Casem said: ‘I’ve known you for a long time bro. A long time. Since you were this big (moving hand to waist height)’.

The protester screamed back: ‘And you’re still killing us’.

Officer Casem became emotional and pointed to his chest as he replied: ‘Twenty five years I’ve been here. Twenty five years!’

Officer Casem is a long serving K-9 policeman in Ferguson and on his Facebook page says he attended the Adventist University of the Philippines, a private Christian college in the Indonesian country.

MailOnline understands that officer Casem has seen the protester in his community since he was a boy but does not know him personally.

During that night police in Ferguson arrested 58 people including 27 protesters from out of state and one woman from Berlin, Germany.

Most arrests were for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers.

Some protesters also threw rocks, tent poles, and bottles - some containing urine.

Police arrested seven protesters on felony charges, including four for allegedly assaulting an officer and three for armed criminal action.
