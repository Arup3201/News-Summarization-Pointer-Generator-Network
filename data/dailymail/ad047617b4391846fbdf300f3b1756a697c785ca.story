Britain's most senior civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood has urged businesses to reveal their concerns about independence, it was claimed this morning

Britain’s top civil servant has been accused of asking businesses to warn against independence.

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has spoken to company chiefs asking them to publicise their concerns, according to the editor of business newspaper the Financial Times.

Lionel Barber told the Today programme that business leaders have been ‘saying privately’ for months that prices will rise after independence and that there will be significant economic costs to independence.

He said: ‘We know Jeremy Heywood has been on the phone to business leaders asking them to speak up about their concerns.’

The allegation will spark accusations from the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign that the civil service, which is obliged to be political neutral, has unfairly intervened in the independence debate.

But the Cabinet Office tonight rejected the accusation. A spokeswoman said: 'It is simply untrue.' 

It comes less than a week after Sir Jeremy Heywood dismissed SNP claims that there was a breach of the Ministerial Code after it emerged that RBS was preparing to move its headquarters to England in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote on Thursday.

Sir Jeremy wrote to Alex Salmond to say no rules had been broken when the BBC reported that RBS had a contingency plan to move its legal office south of the border.

The senior civil servant was replying to Mr Salmond’s call for an investigation into the BBC’s reporting of the move.

The First Minister accused the Treasury of briefing the BBC with ‘market sensitive information’ about RBS before the markets opened.

Sir Jeremy’s letter said the Treasury had simply been confirming the position after reports appeared elsewhere in the media and there had been no breach of the Ministerial Code.

He said: ‘This was not a UK Government announcement - it was simply a confirmation of the Treasury’s understanding of RBS’ contingency planning.

‘In response to .... informed media reports about RBS, the Treasury judged that it was important to set this out - at a time when the UK financial markets were closed - given their overarching responsibility for maintaining financial stability in the UK.’ 

Mr Salmond today repeated his allegation that the Treasury leaked information to the media.

He went on to have a testy exchange with BBC Newsnight journalist Allegra Stratton after she questioned him on what currency an independent Scotland could use.

Ms Stratton was questioning the First Minister on his claims the UK would agree to a currency union with an independent Scotland.

When asked why he was assuming this to be the case, Mr Salmond, who has accused the BBC of bias in its coverage of the referendum, replied: 'If you had followed the debate you'll know.'

Mr Salmond also claims the Prime Minister’s 'fingerprints are all over a scaremongering' campaign being orchestrated by Unionists.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond speaks to the media after a photocall  with business leaders at Edinburgh Airport this morning

Mr Salmond has accused the Treasury of releasing market sensitive information about RBS's plan to move its HQ to England in a bid to discredit the 'Yes' campaign 

The Scottish First Minister made the accusation during a meeting with Scottish business leaders at Edinburgh Airport.

His comments come after a number of banks, businesses and leading retailers voiced their concerns over independence.

Voters will decide the future of Scotland when they go to the polls on Thursday.

Mr Salmond said: 'When you try to pressurise people, pressurise companies, as the Prime Minister has undoubtedly been doing and indeed the Treasury, then that's a different circumstance.

'I think people in Scotland will know the Prime Minister's fingerprints are all over the scaremongering campaign and the Treasury's fingerprints are all over the bank campaign.'
