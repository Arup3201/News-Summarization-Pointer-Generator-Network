This is the dramatic moment that immigration officials raided a wedding and arrested the 24-year-old bridegroom for allegedly overstaying his visa.

Sitting slumped in his chair in the registry office with his arms folded, this Pakistani man could now face deportation for trying to marry a Polish woman in a suspected sham marriage.

He had dressed up for the occasion at Oxford Register Office with a smart grey suit and bow tie. His 20-year-old bride was wearing a white wedding dress and was pictured talking to police officers.

She was released but the man was put in a van. He is now facing removal from the UK. The wedding was raided by Home Office Immigration Enforcement officers yesterday at about 11am.

They were acting on information that the relationship may not be genuine, and this was the second operation targeting suspected sham weddings in Oxford in the last two months.

Last month a Bangladeshi man was arrested in an operation involving Home Office Immigration Enforcement and Thames Valley Police.

Paul Wylie, regional director for Home Office Immigration Enforcement, said: ‘This is the latest example of the excellent work we are doing in the Thames Valley to clamp down on sham weddings.

‘We are working closely with registrars across the region to prevent people from abusing the marriage system in a bid to get round our immigration laws.

‘Where we receive information that a wedding may be suspicious we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene and arrest those involved.

‘A sham marriage or civil partnership typically occurs when a non-European national marries someone from the European Economic Area as a means of attempting to gain long-term residency and the right to work and claim benefits in the UK.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
