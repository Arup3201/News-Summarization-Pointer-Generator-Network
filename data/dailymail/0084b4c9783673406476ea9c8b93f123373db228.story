These eerie photographs show how a pub and shop have become time capsules after being abandoned for years - full of once-treasured possessions.

The premises in Haxey, Lincolnshire have stood empty since the businesses which once occupied them moved out.

But the former tenants did not take all their belongings with them - leaving objects from the past to gather dust and providing a fascinating snapshot of life in the 1970s and 1980s.

Technology: An Imperial typewriter was among the belongings still sitting in the building

Premises: The Tavern Bland and Fresh from the Farm shop in Haxley, Lincolnshire have been standing empty for several years

Photographs Dan Circa captured dozens of evocative photographs from inside the former Fresh from the Farm shop and Tavern Bland.

Among the items he found there were Amstrad walkie talkies, commemorative souvenirs from the 1977 Silver Jubilee and catalogues for Corgi toys.

There was even a typewriter which still held the opening of a letter type out on a piece of paper.

Toys: A leaflet advertising model cars made by Corgi was lying on the floor of the premises

'The front of the building is very photogenic and full of character so I decided to take some shots of the back of it,' said 28-year-old Mr Circa, from Manchester.

'I found the back door wide open, and I was surprised by the amount of items inside.

'A toy car, a train set, various pictures hung on the wall, food tins, ornaments, a bedpan on a bed.

'There was even a typewriter with a letter that someone had started typing.

TV: A television set with old-fashioned dials was among the many objects from the 1970s and 1980s in the disused pub

'There were a great number of children's toys, which made me think about the former residents and why they would leave them behind.'

The main building was used as a tavern as far back as the Victorian era, but it is not known when it closed down for good.

A smaller shop was later built next door to sell produce from the local farm.

'It's very eerie being somewhere like this, as it feels like someone is there with you,' Mr Circa said. 'You feel like you're being watched.

Evocative: Mr Circa said that while exploring the house he had a constant feeling that someone was watching him

Necessities: A bedpan was one of the less decorous items abandoned inside the building

'There was one door on the top floor which had no lock, but refused to open. I thought it best to skip that room.

'People are always amazed when they see photographs of old abandoned buildings. They wonder how I find these places and how they have just been left to sit like this.

'Through my photography I hope that the profile of this place is raised and someone restores it.'

Closed down: The text of the sign of the Tavern Bland is becoming illegible with the passage of time

Next door: A small wooden building was set up next to the pub to sell produce from the local farm
