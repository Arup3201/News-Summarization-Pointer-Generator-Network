The much-maligned security perimeter at New York’s busiest airport has failed again after two kayakers claim they washed ashore without being detected by police.

Anthony Giglio, of suburban Inwood, and Jordan Crooms, of Queens, were kayaking through Jamaica Bay Friday evening when their kayak rolled over and they swam to a pier on the property of John F. Kennedy International Airport near a scant-used runway. 

No one knew the pair, both 21, was there until they found a construction worker to call for help because there are no security patrols at night, critics claim.

Crooms told the New York Post that they were ‘just kayaking at night’ when their three-man vessel rolled over and they lost two paddles.

‘We had one paddle left,’ Crooms continued. ‘We were going toward the closest spot to shore.’

The two men found a dock just off runway 41, and made their way to safety without being detected by the $100million security system in place to thwart such breaches, sources told the paper.

‘We were almost drowning. We couldn’t hang onto the boat, and we were getting pulled under and out,’ Giglio told WCBS. ‘We found a construction worker, and he said, ‘are you guys alright? Thank god you’re alive.’

Where they landed: On this pier just off runway 41 on the airport's southern shore

On the water: JFK Airport is bordered to the south by Jamaica Bay, a waterway with boaters and other locals looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city

The same runway was breached only two 
years ago when a jetskier ran out of gas, swam to shore, scaled an 
eight-foot fence and walked across two runways into the airport seeking 
help, according to the station.

That man also eluded detection by the perimeter ‘fence’s motion sensors.

‘You’ve got a system that is supposed to provide protection, and what happened?’ Counterterrorism expert William Vorlicek asked the station.

‘Once again a perimeter security breach at JFK Airport raises serious concerns about the Port Authority’s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System,’ a Port Authority police union spokesperson told the Post, ‘a system the PAPBA believes is a failure.’

The Port Authority insisted to WCBS that ‘kayakers did not breach the secure airfield. They were seeking help in a restricted water area and at a light pier.

Both men were treated for hypothermia at a nearby hospital and charged with trespassing.
