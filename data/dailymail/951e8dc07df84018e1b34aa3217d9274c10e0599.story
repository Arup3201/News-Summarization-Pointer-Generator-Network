Deciding whether or not to stay friends with an ex can be an emotional minefield. But straight-talking Samantha Brick has some simple advice: Move on, ladies!

Writer Samantha was asked to share her opinions on relationships with ex partners for Bella magazine this week, and the feisty 42-year-old didn't hold back, singling out Simon Cowell's long-term ex Sinitta for some tough talking.

Samantha says: 'I scoff at Sinitta, hanging on for dear life to remain friends with Simon Cowell. He has a new partner, who is five months pregnant with his son. Who is Sinitta kidding? Move on, girl! How on earth can you look to the future when you haven’t closed the door on your past?'

Samantha is famously living in domestic bliss in the Midi-Pyrénées, south west France, with her French husband and a litter of puppies.

Sinitta, who has married and divorced as well as adopted two children since splitting with fiance Simon in 1984, allegedly burst into tears after learning the shock news that he was expecting a child with married US socialite Lauren Silverman, 36.

The couple dated on and off for twenty years and remain particularly close, with Sinitta, 50, a constant fixture on the multi-millionaire's Caribbean jaunts.

Sinitta and Simon split in 1984 but continued dating on and off for 20 years afterwards. Sinitta allegedly burst into tears when she heard that Simon was to have a child with Lauren Silverman, saying: 'It should have been me!'

Samantha says: 'Sinitta is living 
proof that you really can’t be friends with an ex, and I genuinely take 
issue with those platonic ‘mates’ who simper and smile sweetly when 
they’re no longer the first on their former lover’s call list

'I
 scoff when they claim the green-eyed monster is something out of a 
kids’ cartoon. If they’re being honest with themselves, when they look 
in the mirror they’re the ones who are coursing with full-blown jealous 
envy.'

Recently the two women appeared on the Alan Titchmarsh show to debate this issue and Samantha claims that while Sinitta put on a brave front as she defended her relationship with TV mogul Simon, 54, she was clearly hurting when the cameras stopped rolling.

Samantha says: 'When you’ve had a sexual relationship with someone – and they’ve seen you naked – it’s the most intimate and vulnerable you can be with another human being.

'Given that, it’s impossible to turn back the clock. Most of us in modern life struggle to keep up with our real mates, so why hang on to an old relationship unless you’ve got a hidden agenda?'
