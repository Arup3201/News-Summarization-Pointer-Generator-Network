Jack Wilshere has backed new Arsenal team-mate Danny Welbeck to have a big impact for club and country this season.

Welbeck joined the Gunners on Monday in a shock £16million move from Manchester United.

With Olivier Giroud out for three months because of an ankle injury, Welbeck is likely to be thrown straight into Arsenal's first-team and he may now start in England's Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on Monday after Daniel Sturridge suffered an injury in training.

Welbeck injected pace, invention and purpose into a dithering team upon his introduction against Norway on Wednesday night, which bodes well for England and Arsenal, according to Wilshere.

'He is a great addition for Arsenal and hopefully he will keep performing for England as well,' the Arsenal midfielder said.

'He has got great enthusiasm, he wants to run, he will track back, and he has got great quality.

'A lot of people don't give him credit for his technical ability, but he is great on the ball. I am sure there were a few clubs wanting him and there are not many players his age who move from one big club to another big club so that shows his quality.'

Sturridge was sent for a scan after suffering an injury in training at St George's Park on Friday - two days before the squad departs for Switzerland.

It was an injury scare Roy Hodgson could do without, especially after the negative backlash that followed England's uninspiring 1-0 win over the Norwegians.

Just 40,181 people turned up to watch the victory, which came courtesy of a Wayne Rooney penalty.

The 22-year-old thinks England can start to win the fans back by beating the Swiss in Basle on Monday night.

'Going over to Switzerland is a tough game we know if we put in the performance and get the result the fans are going to come back on our side,' said Wilshere, who thinks the negative reaction to England's winless World Cup campaign has been over the top.

Criticism: Jack Wilshere has been criticised by Paul Scholes and Jamie Redknapp for his performances

'If people analysed it a bit more they would have been a bit kinder, there were just a few individual errors and a few lapses in concentration, but at that level that is what you are going to get,' he added.

'When you are playing against (Mario) Balotelli and (Luis) Suarez that is what you are going to get, they are going to punish you and they did.

'But if you look at the games, we had more positives than people give us credit for.'

Wilshere only started one game at the World Cup - the lifeless, miserable dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

But with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard now retired, he is one of the first names on the team sheet.

Future: With Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard retiring from international football, Wilshere is the future

Many pundits, including ex-internationals like Paul Scholes and Jamie Redknapp, have cast doubt on his ability recently, claiming he has not lived up to the hype that surrounded him when he made his England debut four years ago.

Injury has hindered the 21-cap midfielder, but he says he is now almost back to peak fitness.

'It is a big season for me. I have never hid away from that,' Wilshere added.

'I have had a good pre-season for the first time in a few years, I have trained every session, played in all but one of the games.

'I feel good, I am getting stronger and stronger, I am getting near to where I want to be.'

Wilshere knows he and Jordan Henderson, who wore the number four shirt vacated by Gerrard on Wednesday, have big shoes to fill.

'Obviously it's disappointing when Steven and Frank retired, they were massive players for England, over the last 10 years they were great ambassadors and that is the level me and Jordan have got to get to,' Wilshere said.
