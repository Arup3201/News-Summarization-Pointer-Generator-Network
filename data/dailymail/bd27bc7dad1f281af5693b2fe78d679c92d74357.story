They were married for 76 years and never went to bed without kissing each other goodnight.

William and Edna Kreger had met in high school in Michigan and proved to be as inseparable in death as they had been for their more than three-quarters century marriage.

Mr Kreger, 96, passed away Friday evening. Just 12 hours later, his wife also died.

Soulmates: Edna and William Kreger recently celebrated 76 years of marriage together before dying just 12 hours apart. They had six children together and never went to bed without kissing each other goodnight and Mr Kreger telling his wife he loved her.

'I don’t think he could have lived without her,' said Gretchen Wenk, one of the couple's six children. They also had 15 grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.

One of their sons, Conrad Kreger, said he was at his father's bedside at a Detroit hospital and told him moments before he died, 'Dad, it’s OK to go. Make a place for mother.'

'My dad never went to bed without kissing her goodnight and telling her he loved her,' he told the Detroit Free-Press newspaper.

Mr Kreger was hospitalised after suffering a fall. His wife was in hospice care while battling dementia.

After Mr Kreger died Friday evening, Suzanne Smith, another one of their four daughters, spent Saturday morning with her mother.

She told her brother Conrad that when she woke up, she felt her father's presence there and after she took a shower, her mother had passed.

'It’s like my dad came to get her,' Conrad said.

The mayor: Mr Kreger from when he was mayor of Wyandotte for six years during the 1950s. The couple was known as the 'First Family' of the city.

The Kregers, who just celebrated their wedding anniversary on New Year's Eve, were a fixture in their small city, Wyandotte, where Mr Kreger served as mayor from 1950 till 1956.

They were known as the 'First Family' of the city and officials honored them by naming a local park after them in 2009.

Flags in the town were ordered to fly at half-staff after to mourn their death.

'Mr. Kreger lived for his wife and his wife for him,' said Wyandotte Mayor Joseph Peterson.

'God gave this city a very precious couple. Even though they are gone, they will never be forgotten and they will never be replaced.'

'I just hope their family just understands how much they meant to us, the city of Wyandotte,' Mr Peterson told Patch.com.

In addition to serving as mayor, Mr Kreger was on the former county board of supervisors, owned Coca-Cola bottling facilities and was once the publisher of the News-Herald family of newspapers.

'He used to go to work at 5 o’clock in the morning and come home at 10 o’clock at night,' Conrad Kreger said.

'Mom had a great sense of humor,” Wenk told The News-Herald of Michigan.

'She was fun-loving and very bright. She was the glue that kept the family together.'

Honored: The Kregers had a local park named after them in Wyandotte

The couple will have a combined funeral today.

'We are celebrating their extraordinary life and external love,' said granddaughter Elizabeth Kreger.
