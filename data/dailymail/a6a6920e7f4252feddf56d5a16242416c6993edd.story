Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross faced a storm of protest yesterday after he appeared to suggest women could ‘aggravate’ their risk of being raped.

The broadcaster likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing cash by the front door, or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of their cars.

He insisted he was not blaming victims – saying ‘No amount of temptation can excuse rape’ – but questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because they felt partly responsible.

Nick Ross wrote in his new book that 'not all rape is rape' and said that some situations are more complicated

In an extract from his new book, 
published in the Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘Rape victims were once 
treated appallingly, as though it was all their fault, but have we now 
gone too far the other way?

‘Many of the victims seem to think we
have. The main argument of my book is this: we can aggravate crime by 
tempting fate, and we curb it by playing safe.

‘We have come to acknowledge it is 
foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car. We would laugh at a 
bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door. We would be aghast if 
an airport badly skimped on its security measures.

‘Our forebears might be astonished at
how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been 
regarded as incitement.

‘Not even in the licentious days of 
Charles II in the 17th Century was it acceptable for women to dress as 
provocatively as they have done in Western culture since the 1960s. 
Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out
late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go
to bed with one-night stands.’

Ross cited 'booze culture' as one of the reasons that the situation is more complicated. He added that our forebears would have been shocked with how women behave these days

Mr Ross, 65, who presented Crimewatch
from 1984 to 2007, provoked outrage among campaigners against rape and 
on social networking sites.

He said the Mail on Sunday had 
misquoted him in its headline, which said ‘Not all women are victims and
not all rape is rape’, but said the edited extract was fair.

Campaigners described his remarks as 
‘outdated and ridiculous’ and former Conservative MP Louise Mensch 
described the extract as ‘pretty damning’. Another former Crimewatch 
presenter, Jacqui Hames, said on Twitter: ‘Struggling to match the man I
know with the comments!!!! What on earth is going on?’

But Mr Ross also received several messages of support, including one from a woman who described herself as ‘a multiple victim’.

In his book Crime, serialised in the 
Mail on Sunday, Mr Ross described how former Justice Secretary Ken 
Clarke faced outcry in 2011 when he used the phrase ‘serious rape’.

Mr Ross wrote: ‘It has become sacrilege to suggest that there can be any gradation: rape is rape.

Ross is famous for presenting Crimewatch with the late presenter Jill Dando

‘The real experts, the victims, know 
otherwise. Half of all women who had had penetrative sex unwillingly do 
not think they were raped, and this proportion rises strongly when the 
assault involves a boyfriend, or if the woman is drunk or high on drugs:
they led him on, they went too far, it wasn’t forcible, they didn’t 
make themselves clear... For them, rape isn’t always rape and, however 
upsetting, they feel it is a long way removed from being systematically 
violated or snatched off the street.’

Mr Ross said the book was ‘serious, 
carefully researched and evidence-based’ and an attempt to have a 
reasoned debate about a sensitive subject.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘Of course I 
do not compare a woman to a laptop. That is nothing short of 
misrepresentation of my message.

‘What I am saying is that opportunity
and temptation are key  factors in all crimes, and so far as the 
evidence goes sex crimes are no exception.

‘Far from blaming people my book says
we are too quick to blame, and that it tends to distract us from 
finding solutions to crime.’
