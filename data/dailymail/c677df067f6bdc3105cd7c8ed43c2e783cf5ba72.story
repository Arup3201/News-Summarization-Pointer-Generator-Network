A war hero who lost a leg after standing on an IED in Afghanistan is one of 12 brave Marines who have posed for a charity calendar to raise money for their comrades.

Ash Swinard, 29, and his fellow servicemen, appear in a series of poses showing the new career paths they have taken since leaving the military.

Several soldiers, who were medically discharged from the army feature in the calendar shoot, showing how they have moved on since their injuries.
