Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company will produce one of its existing lines of Mac computers in the United States next year. 

In a series of interviews he revealed the giant will spend $100m to move a production line from China to the US.

He also spoke about his relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs - and denied claims he was 'like a robot'.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed plans to move one of the firm's major production for its Mac computers to the US from China

Cook made the comments in part of an interview taped for NBC's 'Rock Center,' but aired Thursday morning on 'Today' and posted on the network's website.

In a separate interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he said that the company will spend $100 million in 2013 to move production of the line to the U.S. from China.

'It’s not known well that the engine for the iPhone and iPad is made in 
the U.S., and many of these are also exported—the engine, the processor,' he said.

'The glass is made in Kentucky, and next year we are going to bring some
production to the U.S. on the Mac.

'We’re really proud of it.

'We could have quickly maybe done just 
assembly, but it’s broader because we wanted to do something more 
substantial.

'So we’ll literally invest over $100 million.

'This doesn’t 
mean that Apple will do it ourselves, but we’ll be working with people, 
and we’ll be investing our money.

Like most consumer electronics companies, Apple lets contract manufacturers assemble its products overseas.

However, the assembly accounts for little of the cost of making a PC or smartphone. Most of the cost lies in buying chips, and many of those are made in the U.S., Cook noted in his interview with NBC.

The company and its manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group have faced significant criticism this year over working conditions at the Chinese facilities where Apple products are assembled, prompting Foxconn to raise salaries.

Cook didn't say which line of computers would be produced in the U.S. or where in the country they would be made.

Regardless, the U.S. manufacturing line is expected to represent just a tiny piece of Apple overall production, with sales of iPhones and iPads now dwarfing those of its computers.

Cook said in his interview with NBC that companies like Apple chose to produce their products in places like China, not because of the lower costs associated with it, but because the manufacturing skills required just aren't present in the U.S. anymore.

He added that the consumer electronics world has never really had a big production presence in the U.S. As a result, it's really more about starting production in the U.S. than bringing it back.

Apple originally made its computers in the U.S. It started outsourcing production in the mid-90s, first by selling some plants to contract manufacturers, then by hiring manufacturers overseas. It assembled iMacs in Elk Grove, California, until 2004.

The news comes a day after Apple posted its worst stock drop in four years, erasing $35 million in market capitalization.

Apple shares fell $1.79 to $537 in Thursday morning trading.

Cook also revealed how Steve Jobs' made Cook's elevation to CEO drama-free.

'He goes, “I never want you to ask what I would have done,' said Cook.

'Just do what’s right - he was very clear.

He was making this point, and he says, “I hope you listen to my input if I want to input on something.”

I said, “Of course.” (Laughs.)

But he was so clear, and I have to tell you that it’s probably 
removed a tremendous burden from me that would have been there 
otherwise.

And he repeated this much closer to his passing.

I think in the second instance, I think he did that because he knew it would lift a burden.

It was his way of making sure Apple would not be burdened by the past.

'Maybe the most underappreciated thing about Steve was that he had the courage to change his mind. And you know—it’s a talent.'

Cook also spoke about how he is perceived outside the firm.

'The person you read about is robotic.

'There are some good things about that, perhaps. (Laughs.) Discipline comes to mind. But it sounds like there is just no emotion. People that know me, I don’t think they would say that. I certainly am not a fist-pounder. That isn’t my style. But that and emotion are two different things. On Apple's remarkable year of innovation, he said: 'No company would have done what we did this year.

'Think about it. We changed the vast majority of our iPhone in a day. We didn’t kind of—you know, change a little bit here or there.

'iPad, we changed the entire lineup in a day. The most successful product in consumer electronics history, and we change it all in a day and go with an iPad mini and a fourth-generation iPad.

'Who else is doing this? Eighty percent of our revenues are from products that didn’t exist 60 days ago. Is there any other company that would do that? '

He also addressed the firm's issues with its Maps service.

'We had a list of things that we thought would be a great customer experience, and we couldn’t do it any other way than to do it ourselves.  We set on a course some years ago and began to do that.

'So it wasn’t a matter of saying, 'Strategically it’s important that we not work with company X.' We set out to give the customer something to provide a better experience. And the truth is it didn’t live up to our expectations. We screwed up.

On Apple's litigation with Samsung, he admitted 'It is awkward. I hate litigation. I absolutely hate it. For us, this is about values.

'What we would like, in a perfect world, is for everyone to invent their own stuff. We love competition.

'But we want people to have their own ideas and invent their own stuff. So after lots of trying, we felt we had no other choice.'

On why mobile software head Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett were replaced, Cook revealed: 'The key in the change that you’re referencing is my deep belief that collaboration is essential for innovation—and I didn’t just start believing that.

'I’ve always believed that. It’s always been a core belief at Apple. Steve very deeply believed this… So how do we keep doing that and keep taking it to an even higher level? You have to have to be an A-plus at collaboration.'
