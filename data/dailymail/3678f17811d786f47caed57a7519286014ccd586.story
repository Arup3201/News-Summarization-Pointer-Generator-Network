In the future will it be possible to have houses that expand and contract as it gets hotter and colder?

That’s the dream of a team of students who have designed a shape-shifting prototype that can bend and twist at high temperatures.

The structure responds to temperature changes which could allow for future constructions that can be shape-shifted as needed using heat-carrying wires embedded in the structures.

Researchers at Barcelona’s Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya have designed a prototype structure that can change shape (shown). When it is heated above 60°C it expands and grows into a new form and holds its shape when it cools

The project is the work of students Ece Tankal, Efilena Baseta and Ramin Shambayati from Barcelona’s Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya (IAAC).

Their supervisors are Areti Markopoulou, Alexandre Dubor and Moritz Begle.

Called Translated Geometries, the project makes use of something called Shape Memory Polymers (SMP) to create the responsive architecture.

Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a shape-shifting material from wax and foam

It's hoped the material will lead to robots being able to change from a rigid to liquid-like state.

It is self-healing, and the material could be used to build deformable surgical robots, which would move through the body with ease to reach a particular point.

It could also be used in search and rescue situations in the future.

When the temperature is raised to 60 to 70°C (140 to 158°F), the prototype undergoes geometric deformations in an origami-like process.

As it cools it retains the newly acquired shape, returning to its original flat state when it is heated again.

While this means it only moves when it is heated, the team says it is an important goal towards architecture that can respond to its environment.

The prototype is made of plywood, with embedded wires heating the various triangulated segments.

Through expansion alone the prototype could increase its surface area by up to four times, reports Wired.

As to the potential uses of the prototype, Shambayati tells MailOnline: 'At the moment we envision a multi-purpose public structure or pavilion that is able to transform on a daily basis depending on the specific need, site, amount of users, and event.

'For example, imagine an outdoor gallery or performance space that can be reshaped for different scenarios.

'As for houses, it’s too early to say but it could perhaps be most incorporated into a home’s main living space.

'Perhaps in the future the ability for a living and entertaining space to be able to transform and host a variety of guests or events would be interesting.'

Drones and gravity (shown) can also be used to pull it into different arrangements. When it cools it solidifies in the new position and flattens when heated again. While only a prototype for now the researchers say it could one day lead to houses that change with temperature

In addition they show how, when heated, the prototype doesn’t just expand - it can actually be moulded as well.

They demonstrated this by using drones, inflatables and gravity to pull the structure into new shapes.

‘We decided that, to best suit our want for structural adaptability we needed to find a geometry that could arrive on site in an original state and then having the capacity to deform or expand into a desired shape from actuation forces,’ Shambayati explains on his website.

‘Therefore, a somewhat foldable structure was deemed to be able to give us this required expansion upon arrival on site, which is why we looked into rigid foldable origami patterns.'
