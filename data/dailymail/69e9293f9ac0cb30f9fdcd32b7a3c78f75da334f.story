Two hospital workers and a pilot were
killed when a medical helicopter crashed in Tennessee as the aircraft 
was headed to pick up a sick child, officials said on Tuesday.

The hospital identified those killed as 
47-year-old pilot Charles Smith, 43-year-old nurse Carrie Barlow and 
43-year-old respiratory therapist Denise Adams.

Le
Bonheur Children's Hospital President and CEO Meri Armour said the 
Hospital Wing helicopter was cleared for both weather and flight plans 
when it took off Tuesday morning headed to Bolivar.

Carrie Barlow had worked as a nurse for 13 years. She is pictured here with her husband Keith and was the mother to three children

Denis Adams had served as the hospital's Pedi-Flite respiratory therapist for the past eight years. She lived in Arlington with her husband, Rodney, and was the mother to three children

The child was not on board the aircraft and was eventually taken by ground ambulance to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Armour said.

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said in an email that her agency and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.

'All we know is that when the helicopter took off it was cleared from both weather and flight plans,' Armour said in a phone interview.

When the helicopter didn't respond 
during a routine 10-minute check-in around 6.20am, authorities began 
searching by air and ground.

They found the burning wreckage in a wooded
area of Somerville, about 45 miles east of Memphis.

'This was a very experienced pilot 
and a very experienced crew and a great helicopter, so we're all anxious
to know what happened,' Armour said.

She estimated that the aircraft was about a half hour into the flight when it went down. Fayette County Sheriff's Office Inspector Ray Garcia spoke by phone from the scene on Tuesday afternoon.

'There
not very much left of (the helicopter), and what little there is is 
badly burned,' he said. 'It's just basically debris at this point.'

Barlow worked as a nurse in West 
Tennessee for 13 years. She lived in Halls with her husband, Keith, and 
was the mother to three children.

Adams
had served as the hospital's Pedi-Flite respiratory therapist for the 
past eight years. She lived in Arlington with her husband, Rodney, and 
was the mother to three children.

Smith
began his career at Hospital Wing in 2012, the same year he retired 
from the aviation unit of the Memphis Police Department after 25 years 
of service. He lived with his wife, Chi, and their two sons in Eads.

The sick child was not on board the aircraft and was eventually taken by ground ambulance to Le Bonheur, Armour said.

According
to a news release, Le Bonheur offers the only pediatric transport 
service in a 130-mile radius and takes more than 400 critically ill or 
injured children by helicopter each year.

Garcia
said the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation 
Administration are conducting the investigation into what happened.

Hospital Wing is a non-profit air medical transport partnership with Le Bonheur and other Memphis-area hospitals.

Another
Hospital Wing helicopter crashed in West Tennessee in March 2010 when 
the pilot tried to outrun a storm. That crash killed the pilot and two 
nurses.

At that time, improving the safety of emergency medical services flights was on the NTSB's 'most wanted improvements' list.

It
first made the list in 2008, a year when the industry suffered a record
28 fatalities in seven helicopter accidents. The agency's focus on the 
problem may have had some impact.

According
to statistics provided by NTSB, 2011 and 2012 each saw only one fatal 
helicopter emergency medical services crash. But those numbers began to 
creep up again this year. Including Tuesday's accident, 2013 has seen 5 
fatal helicopter EMS crashes with 12 killed.
