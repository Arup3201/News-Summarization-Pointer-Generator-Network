Ravel Morrison will suffer the ignominy of training with the Under 21 side following his return to West Ham.

The forward has been on loan at Cardiff City but has returned to Upton Park early after Bluebirds manager Russell Slade made it clear he had no future at the club.

However, there will be no place for the former Manchester United forward in Sam Allardyce first-team plans, meaning Morrison will be told to train with West Ham's Under 21 side.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce won't risk the harmony in his squad by giving Morrison another chance

Age: 21

Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester

Position: Midfielder

Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014)

Career appearances: 80

Career goals: 14 

Allardyce is delighted with his squad's dynamic following their excellent start to the season and doesn't want to do anything that may harm that.

Morrison and Allardyce have not always seen eye-to-eye since the 21-year-old's arrival at the club in 2012, and the manager fears the talented forward could have a disruptive influence at Upton Park.

The Hammers will try to sell Morrison in the January transfer window, but know that will be easier said than done.

Morrison is understood to have an £18million release clause in his contract, but West Ham will let him leave for a mere fraction of that price just to get him of their books.

If they don't find a buyer they will even consider the option of paying-up the remaining seven months of his contract to ensure he leaves the club as soon as possible.

West Ham's third option will be to let him run down his contract when he becomes a free agent in the summer.

Despite the club's seeming desperation to rid themselves of Morrison in the coming weeks, there remains regret they were unable to make the move work.

Sir Alex Ferguson persuaded Allardyce to take a chance on Morrison during a PFA event ahead of his move to east London in January 2012, insisting West Ham would be signing potentially one of the best players of a generation if they could keep him focused.

The Hammers knew at the time the move for Morrison would represent a major gamble, but because of his undoubted potential felt it was gamble worth taking.

But it looks certain he has played his last game for West Ham.
