Wiltshire Police's Chief Constable Pat Geenty will not be allowed to retire until an investigation into alleged gross misconduct is completed

A police force has performed a major U-turn after its Chief Constable announced his early retirement while under investigation for gross misconduct.

Pat Geenty said on Wednesday that he was stepping down in May from his role as Chief Constable of Wiltshire, three years before his contract was due to end.

It appeared his decision had been accepted after the force released a statement with a glowing tribute. 

But after The Mail on Sunday raised questions, it was later announced Mr Geenty will stay in post until the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finishes its investigation.

Last night the IPCC said: ‘It is our view that Mr Geenty should not be allowed to retire while our investigation is ongoing and before the conclusion of any proceedings that may follow.’

Mr Geenty, 57, was appointed in January 2013 on a five-year contract. He is paid £144,799. 

Last summer he was reported to the police watchdog over serious allegations dating back to 2009 – when he was Assistant Chief Constable – about complaints made in respect of a sexual abuse case.

In September, the IPCC said that Mr Geenty was accused of having ‘withheld information and misled the complainants’. At the time the chief said he was ‘shocked’ but would co-operate with the inquiry.

However, early last week, Wiltshire Police said Mr Geenty had informed the force of ‘his decision to retire in May’ on Monday and thanked him for his ‘hard work’. 

Then, on Friday, after being questioned by this newspaper, the force issued a statement saying: ‘[Geenty] has committed to remaining in post until the ongoing IPCC investigation in which he is involved is concluded.’

Had the retirement gone ahead it would have angered Home Secretary Theresa May, who has just passed a law to stop officers escaping justice by quitting while facing disciplinary action.
