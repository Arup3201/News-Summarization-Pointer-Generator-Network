Tax shelter: A court has ruled that Gary Barlow used an so-called investment company in order to avoid tax

Gary Barlow and fellow Take That members invested more than £20million in a massive tax avoidance scheme, it was reported last night.

The X Factor judge, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and their manager Jonathan Wild invested £66million into Icebreaker Management, which styled itself as a music-industry investment scheme.

But a court ruled yesterday that it was in fact an artificial tax shelter for the super-rich.

The band members are now likely to face repaying £20million to HM Revenue & Customs, according to The Times.

For years, HRMC has been trying to shut down Icebreaker Management, which claims to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative and artistic material and taxable profits’. 

In 2012, it was revealed that the three Take That members had invested £26million into an Icebreaker partnership.

It is claimed the musicians were able to avoid tax on about £63 million from world tours and CD sales.

They were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships.

But a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker partnerships, which were formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit - despite investigating in a range of musicians including Sinead O’Connor.

According to The Times, Judge Colin Bishopp said: ‘Icebreaker is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.

‘The aim was to secure [tax] relief for members, and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing.’

He added: ‘No serious or even moderately sophisticated investor, genuinely seeking a profit... would rationally have chosen an Icebreaker partnership.

‘The predominant purpose of entering the scheme was "to achieve a tax saving".’

A spokesman for HRMC said: ‘HMRC has put in place generous reliefs to support genuine business investment and our tax reliefs for the creative industries work well, enabling the UK’s world-class film, television and video production companies to compete on the global stage.

‘But we will not tolerate abuse of the system by people trying to dodge their tax obligations. HMRC will continue to challenge in the courts and anyone who engages in tax avoidance schemes risks not only the high cost of these schemes but also lay themselves open to penalties and, potentially, prosecution.’ 

In 2012, lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, Owen, and Mr Wild confirmed they were investors in the partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes. They added that their clients paid significant amounts of tax.

There is no suggestion that the other members of Take That, Robbie Williams and Jason Orange, were investors.

A spokesman for Icebreaker Management said: ‘This decision puts valuable funding for the UK’s independent music industry in jeopardy.’
