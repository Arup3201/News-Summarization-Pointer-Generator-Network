Surveillance footage has revealed the terrifying moment three children suffered electric shocks after they touched a metal railing in a swimming pool at a Florida apartment complex.

Diego Cabrera, 10, Daniella Gamez, six, and a five-year-old girl were swimming with friends and adults at the Palms West Condos in Hialeah on April 27 when the incident occurred.

The video shows several people swimming in the shallow end of the pool when one girl swims over to the metal rail, which inspectors believe was charged with electricity due to a faulty pool pump.

Terrifying: A video shows a young girl in the water after she touched a metal rail that gave her a shock

Saved: A man pulls her limp body out of the water as other children scramble to escape the danger

When she touches it, she falls limp in the water. A nearby adult quickly pulls her out and carries her up the stairs, the video on Local 10 ABC shows.

As everyone scrambles to get out of the pool, they don't realize that Daniella had also been paralyzed by the shock and remained frozen in the water.

Her grandfather, Freddie Cabrera, then sees her at the bottom of the steps and - risking his own life - runs into the water and pulls her out, falling backwards as drags her body.

A third child, Diego Cabrera, also needed to be saved from the water.

Rescue: He pulls her from the water and all three children were rushed to hospital for treatment

'I was in the pool and then the metal railing, I was swimming close to it and I felt a shock,' he told Local 10.

All three victims spent four nights in the hospital but have fully recovered.

Inspectors say that the pool pump had not been properly grounded and malfunctioned - sending electricity into the water rather than away from it.

They said that the electrical work that had been carried out was unpermitted. The pool has now been drained and remains closed.

Escape: He and six-year-old Daniella Gamez, right, and another child all spent four days in the hospital

Shut down: Inspectors said there had been shoddy wiring at the pool and it has now been drained of water

But CBS4 reported the pool passed a 40 year 
inspection last year and two health department inspections last year. 
The inspections require that the pool be up to electrical code.

City records show no official code violations or fines have been issued to the property owners yet.

The incident comes just weeks after seven-year-old Calder Sloan was killed by an electrical shock in his family's swimming pool a few miles away.

He could not be revived after he suffered a shock following a faulty pool light.
