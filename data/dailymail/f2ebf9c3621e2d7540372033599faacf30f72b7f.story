Chris Eubank Jnr believes a rematch with Billy Joe Saunders could fill a football stadium.

Eubank Jnr lost for the first time as a professional when he took on the British, Commonwealth and European middleweight champion last November.

But he believes the bitter rivalry still burns bright as he looks to bounce back against Dmitry Chudinov next month.

Billy Joe Saunders celebrates beating Chris Eubank Junior via a split decision to retain his titles 

‘He showed heart and he showed that he didn’t want to lose and wanted to keep his belts,’ Eubank Jnr told Sportsmail.

‘Respect is there for anyone I fight, as a fighter, but as a person, I can’t respect anyone like that.

‘He showed why he’s got the belts and I can only hope and pray I get the rematch so I can avenge the loss.

‘The rivalry is a positive to take out of it. If I’d knocked him out in the first round, there would be no more Billy Joe Saunders-Chris Eubank Jnr.

‘The fight was so close and entertaining, it has become a big rivalry and one that will sell out a stadium.

‘You can’t buy that experience, fighting in front of 20,000 people, 75 per cent of who are gunning for your blood.

‘But I walked out with 100 per cent respecting me and I’ll take everything I learned into my next fight.

‘It wasn’t a devastating loss; I didn’t get hurt, I’ve just got to move onwards and upwards.’
