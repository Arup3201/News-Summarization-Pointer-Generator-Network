Silvio Berlusconi has labelled judges who ordered him to pay his ex-wife £29 million a year in a divorce settlement as 'feminists and communists'.

The 74-year-old lashed out during a TV interview in his first public comments on the decision which emerged last month.

The ruling works out at £82,000 a day, four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion.

Asked about the Milan court’s ruling, the former PM who is planing a political comeback at the general election next month said: ‘That figure was decided on by three feminist and communist judges. It’s something unreal.’

The ruling said the money would allow Veronica Lario, the mother of Mr Berlusconi’s three children, to 'live in the manner that she was accustomed to during her marriage' and it also noted she was 'without a home as part of the settlement'.

Miss Lario began proceedings against Mr 
Berlusconi three years ago after it emerged he had attended the 18th 
birthday party of lingerie model Noemi Letizia.

The revelation sparked fury from his then wife who accused him of never attending birthday parties of their own children.

As a result, she said that she could 'no longer live with a man who associates with minors' and she instructed lawyers to begin divorce proceedings against her husband.

However Mr Berlusconi added in his TV interview that he hoped 'to sort things out amicably with Veronica' as they were still on good terms.

However, the judges hit back yesterday. In a statement, senior judges criticised him for his ‘mocking’ of the judiciary.

In October he was convicted of tax fraud and given a four year sentence which was later reduced to one year but he is appealing this verdict as well and he is also currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of office.
