Derry Mathews has promised to make the first defence of his world title against Anthony Crolla - if he can first dethrone Richar Abril.

Mathews will take on the WBA lightweight champion in Liverpool on March 6 after Crolla's own shot at the title was wrecked when he suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after interrupting a robbery.

And Mathews wants to complete his trilogy with his old rival having won one and drawn the other of their two previous battles.

He said 'It’s a dream come true for me to finally fight for the world title, but to have the opportunity to do it in my home city is unbelievable.

'Whereas other fighters from the city have had to go overseas for their chances, Frank [Warren] has got me mine on my own door step and now it’s down to me to deliver the goods on my side and win the title.

'I’m not underestimating Abril one bit, he’s the world champion, but I’m confident in my own abilities and I believe that I have the tools to end Abril’ s reign and take the world title from him. He’s not a huge puncher, he’s 32 now, and I believe that it’s my time to take over.

'I really felt for Anthony, yes we’re sporting rivals, but that was terrible what happened and I was truly gutted for him. I hope that he gets medically cleared and fit to box so that he can resume his career because he’s a tremendous fighter and person.

'He missed out on his shot at Abril because of what happened, but should I come through against Abril and win, then I will give him a shot at the world title. A third fight between us is a natural and would be a fantastic battle of Britain.'

Champion Abril has only fought once a year in the last three years, making a single defence of his title

Abril, who is based in Miami having defected from Cuba, has only fought once in each of the last three years but has won 19 of his 23 fights.

He won his title with a points win over Sharif Bogere in 2013 and made one defence last year against Edis Tatli in Finland.

Abril said: 'I’m looking forward to defending my title against Derry Mathews. He is a tough, experienced, fighter, but I plan on coming to the UK, getting the KO and leaving with my belt.'
