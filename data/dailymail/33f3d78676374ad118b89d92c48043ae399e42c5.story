A Spanish photographer has shed light on the forgotten side of prostitution with a series of striking images of women waiting for their next customer on deserted roads.

Txema Salvans, who is based in Barcelona, has aptly called the set of pictures he captured 'The Waiting Game' and hopes they draw attention to the vulnerability of these women.

The 43-year-old took the photos while driving along the Mediterranean coast.

The 43-year-old photographer, who is based in Barcelona took the images while driving along Spain's Mediterranean coast

Mr Salvans has entitled his series of pictures 'The Waiting Game' as they all show the women waiting for their next customers

Although the roads look empty, they are well travelled and are often used by truck drivers.

In order to get his shots, Mr Salvans decided to disguise himself when taking the images.

And the result is that the pictures offer an authentic look into the world of road side prostitution, without revealing the women's identities.

Some might assume that it is a thing of 
the past for a sex worker to aimlessly walk up a busy highway in hope of
 someone pulling over.  

However many sex workers still wait for their next customer on deserted roads, which can often leave them in unsafe hands. 

Mr Salvans explained: "The tragedy is not so much in the fact of prostitution, because if you decide to be a prostitute and you can control with which clients and the environment in which you work, and the rates you wish to charge, that is your own decision. 

'But these girls don't even decide, and the tragedy is in the environment in which they work. They are absolutely unprotected.'

Although the roads the women stand beside look deserted, they are well travelled and are often used by truck drivers

Mr Salvans says it is a 'tragedy' that these women are forced to work in this environment

The work of these prostitutes often leaves them vulnerable with Mr Salvans saying they are 'unprotected'
