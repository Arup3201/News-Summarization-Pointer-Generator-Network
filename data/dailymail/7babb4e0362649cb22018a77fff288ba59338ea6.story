A man who was driving around in the middle of the night to clear his head  has found the $250,000 NASCAR race car that was stolen from a hotel parking lot.

Philip Whitmer, 30, from Monroe, Georgia, was driving along around 2.30am Saturday morning in Atlanta suburb Loganville when he saw driver Travis Kvapil's bright orange Team XTREME car.

The self-employed NASCAR fan had heard about the Friday morning theft outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia, but was 'shocked' when he stumbled upon the now-famous racer while thinking about his 'rocky' relationship.

'I said there's no way it's that car. I didn't believe it,' he told Daily Mail Online.

Philip Whitmer, 30, of Monroe, Georgia, found Travis Kvapil's NASCAR vehicle when he was driving around at 2.30am to clear his head about relationship issues

NASCAR fan Mr Whitmer posted this picture of the found car on his Facebook page, where his friends could not believe what he had found

Mr Whitmer saw the car on a dirt road and posted a picture of it on Facebook for his incredulous friends.

He had driven past the  road previously in the night around 1am and decided not to go down it.

'It's a very remote road so it's got to be somebody from around here who knows this area to stumble across that road,' he said.

The front of the car near the air dam was damaged, and the car was parked next to a small wooden ramp, presumably used to remove it from the trailer it was stolen in.

Inside of the car appeared fine, according Mr Whitmer.

There is a neighborhood abut 200 yards from where the vehicle was parked, but no suspicious activity was reported in that area prior to Mr Whitmer's call, a spokesman for the Gwennitt County Police told Daily Mail Online. 

Mr Kvapil was supposed to drive the Chevrolet race car on Sunday but had to drop out of the Atlanta Sprint Cup Series event after missing a mandatory inspection.

Mr Whitmer  was dismissed from the scene by police while they contacted the small-budget Team XTREME, who arrived at the site around 4:30am.

Team Xtreme owner John Cohen and his colleagues came and picked up the vehicle around 4.30am Saturday morning after being contacted by police in Gwennitt County

The team posted a picture of owner John Cohen standing next to the vehicle, saying that they are 'so happy to have "old faithful" back'.

Mr Whitmer has not yet met the NASCAR team, though police said they would relay his information to the owners. 

Car and team are heading back to their base in Mooresville, North Carolina, according to NBC. 

The No. 44 car inside its trailer was hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow when it was stolen 35 miles from where it was found.

Surveillance photo shows the truck and trailer being driven out of the parking lot by an unidentified man around 5:30am, just 15 minutes before the team was scheduled to leave for the Atlanta Motor Speedway.

A crewman had been outside smoking a cigarette just a few minutes before the theft of the trailer, which had no markings saying that it had a valuable NASCAR vehicle inside. 

In addition to the race car, the trailer also contained a spare engine valued at $100,000 and racing equipment valued at $17,500, according to a police report. 

Team Xtreme Racing owner John Cohen estimated the total value to be somewhere between $350,000 and $400,000.

NASCAR fans and drivers offered rewards for finding the vehicle on Friday, including pit pass tickets to races and a lifetime of free food from Golden Corral offered by driver Michael Waltrip. 

Mr Whitmer said he had been contacted on social media by many NASCAR fans and drivers, and that there wasn't anything he'd particularly like but 'it might be nice to have a nice little payday'.

When asked about possibly getting an endless amount of free buffets, he said, 'That'd be fine with me.' 

Team Xtreme is taking the car back to their North Carolina base and plans to race at next weekend's event in Las Vegas after being unable to compete in Atlanta. 

Mr Kvapil tweeted about the theft on Friday, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. 

He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap''. 

The driver had doubted that the thieves would be able to make any money off of the car.

'There's really no use for it out in the general public. I don't really know what you can do with it.' 

'I hope they realize that and will leave it somewhere where police can find it.'

Mr Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first track appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback'. 

'You can handle maybe getting a flat tire, or getting caught up in a wreck, or a blown engine, something that actually happens on the race track,' he said. 

'Or you don't qualify, because you don't have enough speed. But to not even get a chance ... that's pretty disheartening.'

The theft hit the small Team Xtreme Racing even harder, especially after they had wrecked a car in a Daytona 500 qualifying race just last week. 

Not only did the team have to work overtime to get a new car prepared for this weekend's race, the stolen car was Mr Cohen's favorite.

'I just feel bad for my guys, they were really proud of this car,' he told ESPN. 

'I called that car Old Faithful, because you could run that car anywhere and it would do good.'
