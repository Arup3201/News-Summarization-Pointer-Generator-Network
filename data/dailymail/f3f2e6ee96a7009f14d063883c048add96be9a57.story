Sash Nemphos, 16, has been charged after allegedly stashing explosives and a gun at his home in a deadly plot to carry out a shooting at his school

A 16-year-old student has been charged as an adult after allegedly stashing explosives and a gun at his home in a deadly plot to carry out a shooting attack at his Maryland school. 

Sash Nemphos, described as a 'shy and talented artist', was originally arrested on suspicion of a series of vehicle break-ins on York Road in Monkton, Baltimore County, last Saturday.

But during a police interview, he allegedly revealed that he had explosive devices at his home and wanted to kill people at the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology.

He reportedly told officers he planned to carry out the shooting spree on Monday - in just two days' time - and had even practiced taking a handgun to the school, hidden inside his backpack. 

During a search of Nemphos's house in Monkton, Baltimore County Police apparently found three crude, homemade explosives, hazardous materials and a gun, according to the Baltimore Sun.

They then called their Hazardous Devices Team, who dismantled the devices , made from 'readily-available. The teenager reportedly told police he had taken the handgun from his father's job. 

Nemphos, who lives in the 600 block of Quiet Oaks Lane, was originally charged as a juvenile on suspicion of the possession of a destructive device and a handgun violation, among other charges.

But on Monday, Baltimore County Police said the sophomore - who did not reveal a motive for the alleged plot - had been given an 'adult' status in the court system, according to NBC.

A force spokesman tweeted: 'Boy who was arrested after explosive devices and a gun found in his home Saturday is now charged as an adult.'

Carver students spoke of their shock at the teenager's arrest, saying the culture of the school, with its diversity of artists, writers and musicians, made each person feel 'valued'.

Proud: Earlier on Monday, Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who interviewed Nemphos 'did an exceptional job of police work'. Above, a Baltimore Police tweet says the same

'I think a majority of the students are shell-shocked right now,' Ron Anahaw, a 17-year-old senior studying literary arts, told the Sun.  

'It is recognized that every individual in the school is worth something, and is a person and is as important as anyone else in the community. No one is ever put down in the school.'

Meanwhile, a woman who has lived across the street from Nemphos and his family for nearly 20 years described the suspect as a 'sweet and kind-hearted' boy who was a gifted artist.

'That's why this is difficult, because it's just kind of hitting everybody - it's just not expected. I just hope that whatever's happening, he's going to get what he needs,' Regina DeSantis told WBAL-TV. 

Stanley Dukes, an employee at the Monkton Grill near Nemphos's home, added: 'He's a little guy. He would come in and sit at one of the tables and sleep. We even comped him food one day, we gave him something to eat.'

Earlier on Monday, Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who interviewed Nemphos 'did an exceptional job of police work'.

In an online statement, he said: 'Thanks to his diligence, we intervened in what could have been an extremely serious situation' at the school in Towson.

Meanwhile, a Carver administrator told the newspaper there were no 'red flags' that could have alerted staff to the student's deadly intentions.

'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery. 'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.'

Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were notified of the suspect's charges on Monday.

School guidance counselors are currently on hand to help students who have concerns or are distressed about the allegations against Nemphos. 

Shooting: It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others

The teenager, who was initially taken for a mental health evaluation, is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a detention center for male youths, without bail. 

He is also charged with theft in relation to the car break-ins he had reportedly carried out. 

It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others

The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide.

Last week, investigators said the shooter had lured his victims to the scene by text message before launching the deadly attack.  

And on Monday, another alleged plot for a school shooting was thwarted by police when a 17-year-old girl was arrested in Radnor Township, suburban Philadelphia.

The senior at Radnor High School allegedly wrote in a notebook that she was influenced by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and wanted to become a mass murderer,

She was arrested and will be charged as a juvenile for making terrorist threats.
