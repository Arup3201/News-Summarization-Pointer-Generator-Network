New Zealanders are to vote on whether to change their national flag, with many including the country's prime minister wanting to see it replaced with the silver fern symbol used by the All Blacks rugby team.

Prime Minister John Key today announced plans to hold a referendum within three years, receiving the backing of his political opponents who said they would follow through with plans even if they oust Key in this year's national elections.

The current flag depicts the Southern Cross star constellation and includes Britain's Union Jack in the top left corner.

Many complain it is too similar to Australia's flag and doesn't reflect New Zealand's independence from former colonial ruler Britain.

But
 many who have served in the military oppose a change. And among those 
advocating a change, there's plenty of debate about a replacement.

Key said he favours a silver fern set against a black background, an image that's popular among sports teams.

Some
 say that would equate the country too much with its sporting heroes and
 would be too reminiscent of a pirate ensign. Some argue the country's 
indigenous Maori should be represented in any new flag.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he favours a switch to the silver fern

In a speech on Tuesday, Key said the flag represents a past era.

'The
 flag remains dominated by the Union Jack in a way that we ourselves are
 no longer dominated by the United Kingdom,' he said.

He
 said Canada's 1965 decision to embrace a distinctive maple leaf design 
was a good example, and he couldn't imagine Canadians now wanting to go 
back to their old Union Jack flag.

'We
 should be represented by a flag that is distinctly New Zealand's,' said
 Key, adding it would not signify an end to the South Pacific nation's 
constitutional ties to the British monarchy or participation in the 
Commonwealth group of countries.

Don
 McIver, president of the Returned and Services Association (RSA), said 
he's proud of a flag that represents more than 100 years of tradition.

'The
 view of the RSA is there is no need to change the flag,' he 
said.'Thirty-two thousand New Zealanders have given their lives under 
the flag and many more thousands have served under it in a combat 
environment.'

The 
Republican Movement of New Zealand, which advocates an end to 
recognizing the British monarch as New Zealand's head of state, remains 
indifferent.

'We 
realize there is momentum to change the flag, and we are not against 
it,' said the movement's chairman, who goes by the single name Savage.

'But the substance is changing the head of state. It's symbolic only to change the flag.'

Yet for many, a new flag would represent another small step by New Zealand toward disentangling itself from its British past.

In 2004, for instance, the country established a Supreme Court to replace Britain's Privy Council as the final court of appeal.

Recent opinion polls have yielded conflicting indications about whether a majority favor a change.

Victor
 Gizzi, the national sales manager at flag manufacturer Flagmakers, said
 'older people tend to want the status quo,' while younger people feel 
differently.

Earlier this year Mr Key said  he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from New Zealand's native flora.

He
 said: 'My own personal view is that the silver fern is the right way to
 go. In my view, the silver fern is something which is applied to our 
greatest sporting teams.
