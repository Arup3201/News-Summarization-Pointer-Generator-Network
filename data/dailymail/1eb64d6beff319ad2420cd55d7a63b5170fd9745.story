Tragic: Paul Franklin Dart, pictured right with friends, was trying to calm down the gunman when he was shot in the head

A married army veteran was shot dead in front of his wife and stepson during an annual family rafting trip on Saturday after a relative urinated on the river bank, enraging the landowner.

James Robert Crocker, 59, confronted the group of family and friends with a 9 mm handgun after they stopped for a quick break at a gravel bar in Meramex, and one of the revelers walked into the woods to relieve himself.

After a brief altercation over whether the gravel bar was private or public property, Crocker shot Paul Franklin Dart, 48, in the head from just a few feet away, as his wife Loretta and her son Josh Kling, 24, watched in horror.

Dart, a union carpenter from Robertsville, died in an ambulance on the way to hospital less than five hours after setting off on the annual trip the group had organized every summer for the past five years.

'I watched him be shot in the face and fall down,' Loretta Dart sobbed in a telephone interview with The St. Louis Dispatch on Monday. 'I watched my husband bleed to death. He was a wonderful man. He didn't deserve this.'

Crocker told police the shooting happened after he accused the group of trespassing on his land and they claimed the gravel bar was public property, leading to a dispute. The laws in Missouri are extremely vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them.

Crocker said during the altercation, one of the men, although not Dart, approached him with rocks in his hands so he fired.

'I just shot the one closest to me,' Crocker said, according to police.

Authorities on Sunday charged Crocker
with second-degree murder. He was being held on Monday in lieu of $650,000
bail at the Crawford County Jail.

Loretta Dart told the Dispatch that the group set off on their outing on the Meramec River at around 9:30 a.m. and stopped at the gravel bar at around 2 p.m. She said it wasn't long before Crocker approached them with the gun, telling them all to get off his land.

She claims he waved his weapon around, firing shots into the air and into the ground near her husband and her cousin, who was the one who had urinated.

According to the Dispatch, the gunman told a detective that men were yelling at him 'stating that they weren't going to leave and that the gravel bar was public property.'

Kling said Crocker told him: 'I have the power here. I have the power,' to which he replied, according to his mother, 'put that gun down and we'll see who has the power.'

As the argument escalated, Loretta Dart's cousin picked up at least one rock and, in an effort to diffuse the situation, Paul Dart stepped between the two men.

Confusion: The laws in Missouri are extremely vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them

Refreshments: The group were floating in the river, pictured, when they stopped on the gravel bar around 2 p.m.

'My husband tried to calm the guy down,' Loretta Dart said. 'He went to the guy's arm to try to stop him, but the guy jerked back and popped him in the face.'

A friend and neighbor of Crocker, Herb Smelser, said the 59-year-old appeared in the front yard of his home with the right side of his face, neck and torso splattered with blood.

'I just shot a guy down at the river,' he told Smelser, according to the Dispatch 'This is his blood. You better call 911.'

He said Crocker was a courteous, hardworking man but was ferociously territorial about his property.

In recent months, he had become increasingly irritated by people urinating, drinking and partying on the gravel bar.

The Missouri Conservation Department said property rights on the river were a complicated aspect of Missouri law and, typically, the question was answered on a case-by-case basis by county prosecutors.

'This is an area of Missouri law still up in the air,' the spokesman added.

Harry Styron, a lawyer from Ozark, Missouri, and an expert on property rights along streams and rivers, said such cases were extremely confusing.

'They are difficult to interpret,' Styron said. 'You are on private property, but you have a right to be there if it's a navigable stream and as long as you are on a gravel bar that is submerged during parts of the year, because it's part of the stream bed.'

He added, that despite the confusion: 'It obviously doesn't have anything to do with people shooting people. We don't have a stand-your-gravel-bar law yet.'
