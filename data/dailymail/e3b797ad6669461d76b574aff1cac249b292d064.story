BBC One was accused yesterday of ‘playing it safe’ and urged to take ‘creative risks’ with its prime time schedule, which is dominated by long-running programmes.

In a report into the channel’s output, the BBC Trust said peak viewing had been taken over by soaps and factual series – many of which were more than 10 years old – rather than new content.

Following publication of the review yesterday, the BBC was urged to create more original content, which was one of its ‘core principles’.

Dominated: The One Show, which launched in 2007, takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours  

Long-running: EastEnders, which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights, takes up 14 per cent

Assessing the performance of all BBC channels, the trust’s report singled out prime time BBC One, noting that almost two thirds of its 7pm to 9pm slot is dominated by the same 10 programmes. All but one of the programmes are at least five years old.

The One Show, which launched in 2007, takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours, while EastEnders, which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights, takes up 14 per cent.

Antiques Roadshow, which has been running for 35 years, and Panorama, which began in 1953, were also among the ten most-broadcast programmes for the time slot. The others were Holby City, The Voice UK, Countryfile, Watchdog, A Question of Sport and Waterloo Road, which will end next year. 

About 5,000 people were surveyed for the review, which found that the average age for BBC One viewers is 59, up from 56 in 2010-2011. BBC Two has seen a similar rise, with an average age of 60 – up by two years. Both channels are losing viewers in the 16-34 age range.

BBC trustee David Liddiment said the trust did not want to replace the dominant programmes in prime time, but to make additions.

He added that BBC One ‘shouldn’t be a succession of high-risk shows just for the sake of it’ but admitted that the dominance of the ten shows meant that a ‘significant number of potential viewers’ were not being served by the channel.

‘BBC television is fulfilling its commitment to deliver a wide range of enjoyable and entertaining programmes and in the past few years there has been an increase in the perceptions of originality across all channels,’ he said.

‘However, the trust believes that BBC One should take more creative risks while serving wider audiences and has asked the executive to set out how it will increase the distinctiveness of schedules.’

The report by the trust states there are ‘wide audience perceptions of the channel being too reliant on familiar titles’ and tending to ‘play it safe’ with programming and scheduling.

A much higher number of new programmes are broadcast after 9pm but Mr Liddiment said there was still a need for ‘greater innovation in factual programming’ and ‘a refreshment of entertainment’ in the nighttime slot.

He added that the BBC needed to do more to appeal to younger viewers and minority ethnic groups.

Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who serves on the Commons Media Select Committee, said he was not surprised by the trust’s findings and added to calls for more original content. ‘To some extent I would like the BBC to concentrate more on that,’ he said. ‘If it means fewer channels with more original content then that might well be a way forward. Providing new and original content is one of the core principles of the BBC.

‘There is plenty of programming from the past that people do want to see, but there are so many ways you can access that through commercial channels and through archives. I think people look to the BBC for new, original drama and comedy.’

Mr Liddiment said the biggest challenge for the BBC was ‘to keep as many people watching as possible’ and that there should be ‘something for everybody’.

He also hinted there may be a rise in entertainment programmes such as The Voice UK.

Dismay: Four Panorama reporters have lost their jobs

There were fears for the future of Panorama last night after its four reporters, who together have more than half a century of experience making the programme, lost their jobs.

There were said to have been scenes of ‘dismay’ as they were told by new editor Ceri Thomas that their jobs no longer exist.

Shelley Jofre, Paul Kenyon, Raphael Rowe and John Sweeney have won several awards but will now have to find alternative roles within the BBC or leave the corporation altogether. The programme will instead be staffed by news reporters and presenters such as Fiona Bruce.

An insider claimed the Panorama team were assured that their jobs were safe. ‘There was a cold, icy silence when the news was announced,’ said the insider.

‘We had been told for weeks and weeks that our jobs would be safe and then last night [Wednesday] we got an email saying to come in in the morning and that’s when they told us. We have six months.

‘Ceri Thomas is the new editor and they have almost certainly brought him in just to do this. We’ve all got years of experience whereas he has been in the job less than a month.

‘How can he tell us that the way forward is to get rid of all the people who’ve made the most Panoramas? How can he justify that?’

Panorama is the world’s longest-running current affairs television programme, having first been shown in 1953. The cuts are part of a restructuring that will result in the BBC’s news operation shedding more than 200 jobs, including around 80 in the newsroom.
