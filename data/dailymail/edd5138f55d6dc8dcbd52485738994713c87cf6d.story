Apple Chief Executive Tim
Cook is joining the roster of the very rich who are giving away
their wealth.

The head of the world's largest
technology corporation told Fortune magazine he plans to donate his
estimated $785million fortune to charity - after paying for his ten-year-old nephew's college education.

'You want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the
ripples for change,' Cook told the magazine.

Philanthropic: Apple CEO Tim Cook plans to donate his estimated $785million fortune to charity, after he pays for his ten-year-old nephew's college education

Fortune estimated Cook's net worth, based on his holdings of
Apple stock, at about $120million. He also holds restricted
stock worth $665 million if it were to be fully vested.

The 54-year-old CEO's revelation in Fortune's lengthy
profile of him is an example of the increasingly public
philanthropy of the world's richest people.

Billionaire financier Warren Buffett is encouraging the very
wealthy to give away at least half their worth in their
lifetimes through the 'Giving Pledge,' whose website lists such
luminaries as Microsoft Corp's Bill Gates, Mark
Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc and Oracle Corp's 
Larry Ellison.

While Cook's largesse could not begin to approach the scale
of a Gates or Zuckerberg - both worth billions of dollars - the
Apple CEO told Fortune he hopes to make a difference.

Cook, who is not listed on the website, is known as an
intensely private person who shuns the spotlight on
philanthropy.

In recent years, however, he has begun speaking out more
openly about issues ranging from the environment to civil
rights. 

Cook, who recently revealed he was gay, spoke out
against discrimination of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transsexual communities during his induction into the Alabama
Academy of Honor last year.

He is the only openly gay chief executive on the Fortune 500 list of biggest U.S. companies, according to CNN. 

Former CEO of BP John Brown, who held the position from 1995 to 2007, only acknowledged he was gay after leaving office when an ex-boyfriend outed him. 

Cook took over Apple's CEO position in 2011 after Steve Jobs resigned.  

He told Fortune he has started donating money to unspecified
causes quietly and is trying to develop a more 'systematic
approach' to philanthropy that goes beyond writing checks.
