Jamie Carragher believes Liverpool have failed to fix their problems from last season, and face a challenge even to make the top four.

Carragher insisted that his former club are still one of the best in the league, but said that without Luis Suarez they might struggle.

Liverpool finished second last season, two points behind Manchester City but, speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, Sportsmail columnist Carragher claimed Monday's early-season defeat would dent their confidence.

Lessons unlearned: Carragher says that Liverpool have not solved the problems they faced last season

'Liverpool were so close to City [last season], you don't want to go to your rivals early on and get a good beating. It was 3-1, it probably could have been four or five nil. 

'The problems that we spoke about last season which lost Liverpool the title, after two games they've already conceded four goals. It's something they're going to have to rectify.'

'People are saying they're not in for the title. I still see think they're one of the best sides in the league.

'But if they continue conceding goals like that, with extra games, no Suarez as well, top four's going to be a fight as well this season for them.' 

Carragher particularly highlighted was the defensive frailties of new signing Dejan Lovren, who cost £20million from Southampton.

'He didn't play well tonight,' said Carragher. 'The whole back four never really functioned well. 

'He's had a difficult night, him and Moreno on that side. It's basic back four work and it's something Liverpool are going to have to work on. 

'If that happens a lot in this league, you're going to get punished. That back four of Manchester City was the difference between tonight in this game.'

Despair: Last season Liverpool fell just short in the title race, finishing four points behind Manchester City

Absent: This year Brendan Rodgers' side may miss the goals of Luis Suarez, last season's top scorer
