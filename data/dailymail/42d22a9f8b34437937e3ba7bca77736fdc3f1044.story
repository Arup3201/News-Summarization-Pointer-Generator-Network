A Florida cop is being hailed a hero after he went above and beyond his duty to rescue a man who got stuck in an intense storm while on his wheelchair.

Officer Gil Benitez was working the night beat on Thursday when the Fort Myers Police Department received a distress call about 8:30pm.

The caller, Michael Arnold, was just a block away from his home but was was caught in the torrential downpour that had just started fallen.

HERO COP: Officer Gil Benitez  says he was just 
doing his job. But to the man he saved, Michael Arnold, the cop's 
actions were a potentially life-saving kindness

'The wind picked up like crazy,' Arnold told  WBBH.'I got to the end of the street and everything just stopped on me.'

The cop ran over to help and found Arnold stranded on the side of the road.

'It was raining so hard, I couldn't even see the stop sign,' Benitez told the station.

Lightning struck twice near the men.

But Benitez was determined: he pushed Arnold home through the storm, helped him dry off and waited for his family to arrive.

Officer Gil Benitez could hardly see through his windshield as he approached Michael Arnold, who was caught in a storm while on his electric wheelchair during

Officer Benitez pushed Arnold all the way home, then helped him dry off and waited until the man's family arrived

'There's not many nice people in the U.S. but you'll come across 
one, or two people, or three people, that are saying: "I've got to help," 
and that's what he did,' Arnold told the station.

Officer Benitez's actions were caught on his dash cam and his act of kindness has made him a quick celebrity.

Yet the hero cop remains humble.

'Any one of us would have done it, I just happened to be there first,' Benitez told WBBH.

But for Arnold, the rescue meant a heck of a lot more.

'Sir,
 I am very grateful for your help,' he said to Benitez via a local TV 
station. 'I didn't even catch your name, but I thank you.'
