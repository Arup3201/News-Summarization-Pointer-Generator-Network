The Daily Mail reported that  Princess Beatrice will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft

At least 24 of the wealthy investors who signed up to be among the first space tourists with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic programme have given up their tickets.

The 800 passengers have stuck with Branson's venture for 10 years despite numerous set-backs and hiccups. 

But the crash of SpaceShipTwo in California's Mojave desert last Friday that killed one pilot and left another in hospital finally prompted three per cent of the 'future astronauts' to pull out.

Peter Ulrich von May, an asset manager based in Switzerland, told The Independent he no longer wishes to travel into space with Virgin Galactic and he has demanded his money back.

He said: 'I want out. I subscribed seven years ago at 63, am still an active private pilot and in good health but who knows how long it will now take. I have already informed VG of my wish - no reply yet.'

The Daily Mail reported two days ago that one of the program's highest-profile customers, Princess Beatrice, will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft after the disaster last week.

'Beatrice was excited by the idea of space tourism, but there is no way she will be going on one of the flights, if they are ever allowed to take place,' a source close to Buckingham Palace revealed.

Tonight, the Telegraph understood 24 have officially filed for a refund.

Galactic Chief Executive George Whitesides told the Telegraph the news was ‘unsurprising’ but his resolve remains 'unshaken'.

He told the paper: 'A few people have asked for a refund. I don’t think that’s surprising and I think what is relevant is that the vast majority have said "don’t give up, keep going, we’re with you".'

An anonymous source told The Independent that a group of more than 30 people had been talking about asking for a refund, a move that could cost Branson millions.

'Before this tragic event happened I had been thinking of pulling my money anyhow because there had been various reports saying it doesn't stand a chance of getting into space,' the source added. 'I am giving serious thought to pulling out.'

More than 700 people - including Hollywood A-listers Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio - have bought tickets for Virgin Galactic space voyage flights, which sell for $250,000.

Ashton Kutcher was one of the first celebrities to book his ticket - and the 500th person overall - and he has since been joined by Katy Perry,  Justin Bieber, Russell Brand and Lady Gaga.

Actress Victoria Principal bought a ticket in 2009, but her representative Alan Nierob told USA Today that she withdrew from the program in 2012.

The crash of SpaceShipTwo in California's Mojave desert on Friday, which killed one pilot and injured another, has reportedly caused many of the millionaire clients of Virgin Galactice to rethink a flight into space

Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson insists Virgin Galactic can 'move forward' and has vowed to travel on a space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed

On Friday, Branson announced on the Virgin Galactic site that refunds would be available following the tragedy and a spokesperson  said that a number of people have asked for their money back.

'We can confirm that less than three per cent of people have requested refunds,' the spokesman said.

But the anonymous source also told The Independent some people are 'die-hard Richard Branson supporters and they will go on it whatever'.

Igor Kutsenko, who runs an advertising agency in Moscow and plans to go into space with his parents, said: 'We were all shocked and disappointed by the tragic news. We are in the project from very beginning.

'My parents are getting older and I'm only worried that their physical ability to participate in this obviously challenging adventure is deteriorating. But we stay firm in our desire to make this suborbital flight.' 

Branson had previously said, 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space program and understands the risks that go with that.'

Since Friday's crash the billionaire tycoon has insisted Virgin Galactic can move forward' and vowed to travel on board the space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed.

He told Sky News: 'We've spent many, many years building a spacecraft, a mothership, a space port, that I think can do the job and do the job safely.

'We will not start taking people until we've finished a whole massive series of test flights and until myself and my family have gone up, and until we feel that we can safely say to people 'we're ready to go'.'

He added: 'All I can say is we will not fly members of the public unless we can fly myself and family members.

'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested - and that it will be - and once it's thoroughly tested and we can go to space, we will go to space.

'We must push on. There are incredible things that can happen through mankind being able to explore space properly.'
