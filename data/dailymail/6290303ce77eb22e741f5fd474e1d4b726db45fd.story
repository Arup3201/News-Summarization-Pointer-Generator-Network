Accidental death: Adriano Bussandri was found dead in his burnt £1.8m home having taken Class-B drugs

A former oil executive found dead after a fire gutted his £1.8million home was hooked on ‘designer drugs’ bought on the internet, an inquest heard.

The badly burnt and wounded body of former finance director Adriano Bussandri, 51, was discovered under debris at the top of the house, near a sharp letter opener and screwdriver.

Police initially launched a murder investigation but later decided that cuts found on Mr Bussandri’s arms, sides and back were most likely self-inflicted because he had a history of self-harming. It was unclear how the blaze had started.

Mr Bussandri, a British citizen of Italian origin, was a founder of London-based wholesale petrol and bio-fuel supplier Harvest Energy, which made almost £26million  last year.

But he resigned from his post  as finance director after it was embroiled in a contaminated supermarket fuel scandal in 2007, which led to £8million in compensation being paid to almost 20,000 Tesco customers after their vehicles were damaged.  

He was not working at the time of his death and lived separately from his wife, Marisa, 50, and daughter Sabrina, 19, in an exclusive area of Putney, South-West London. Mr Bussandri’s brother Franco, who is managing director of Harvest Energy, attended yesterday’s inquest with his brother’s wife.

Drug: The dead high-flyer had taken a large amount of MDPV before his death - a Class B designer drug made up from compounds found in bath salts and plant food

Westminster Coroner’s Court heard how 
Mr Bussandri started taking non-prescription drugs around 11 years ago 
when he suffered a brain haemorrhage following a road accident.

A report from Mr Bussandri’s GP stated
he had ‘a history of depression and drug dependency’ and in 2011 he was
treated at The Priory.

A post-mortem examination found drugs in his system, which he is thought to have bought from Dutch and German websites.

Detective Sergeant Richard Reynolds told the hearing that he  carried out a full search of Mr Bussandri’s home.

He said: ‘Within the property there 
were small quantities of chemical-based compounds, unlike the 
traditional drugs that are more organic, like cocaine and heroin.’

He described the compounds, which are sometimes extracted from everyday household products, as designer drugs.

Probe: At first police considered whether the death may have been murder, but a coroner has ruled it was accidental

The inquest heard firefighters were 
called to an intense blaze at Mr Bussandri’s home in the early hours of 
February 8 this year, after neighbours raised the alarm.

It took around three hours for fire crews to find the body.

Pathologist Robert Chapman later 
recorded a cause of death as inhalation of fire fumes, contributed to by
the drugs found in Mr Bussandri’s system.

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death, Assistant Coroner William Dolman said: ‘To an extent, the 
deceased was the author of his  own destruction, as we have heard that 
the drugs were found in  his system.’
