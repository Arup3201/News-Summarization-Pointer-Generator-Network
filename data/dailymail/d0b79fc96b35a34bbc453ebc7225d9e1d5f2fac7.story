Dr Barend Delport, pictured at an earlier hearing, has been jailed for six years for sexually assaulting and taking intimate pictures of women

A married doctor who sexually assaulted and photographed patients as young as 18 months was jailed for six years yesterday.

Barend Delport, 55, a trusted GP and Christian leader, took 800 photos of women and children at his surgery for his own sexual gratification.

He told his victims – who ranged from a toddler to a woman in her 60s – a raft of lies, even claiming he needed the images for training purposes.

Judge Philip Statman, sentencing  Delport yesterday at Maidstone Crown Court, said it was difficult to imagine ‘a graver breach of trust’.

The doctor carried out the abuse between 2003 and 2012, assaulting numerous victims.

The court was given details of only six – three women and three girls aged 14, four and 18 months – who he sexually assaulted at his surgery in Swanley, Kent.

The South African-born doctor was caught only after a mother asked why her young daughter had been intimately examined and photographed by Delport when she had only complained of a stomach ache.

When police received the complaint in March, a letter was sent to every patient at The Oaks surgery urging them to get in touch if they had concerns. It provoked a string of similar allegations.

Shortly after his arrest, Delport resigned from the surgery and  left the £500,000 three-bedroom home he shared with his wife  Sally in the village of Eynsford,  near Sevenoaks.

Mrs Delport, who is a 54-year-old jewellery maker, is said to ‘remain committed’ to her husband, although they have separated.

Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said Delport concocted a string of excuses to justify taking pictures of his victims.

He claimed to be a dermatologist when taking intimate pictures of a child suffering from a skin complaint, the prosecutor said.

He also took photographs of women telling them he was  building a case against the midwives at Darent Valley Hospital who he falsely accused of failures of care. When he was arrested police found 500,000 images on  his computer.

Of those, more than 5,500 were pornographic and 842 were of patients he had taken himself.

Photographic consent forms were also seized in which patients had agreed to being photographed  during their examinations. ‘The mothers of the child victims all feel totally and understandably abused,’ said Mr Haycroft.

‘They have feelings of guilt and they have lost trust in doctors completely.’

Abuser:  Many of the patients allowed themselves to be photographed because they trusted Delport as their doctor

Delport admitted 26 offences, including four indecent assaults on adults and three indecent assaults on children.

He
 also admitted two counts  of possessing indecent images of children, 
five of making indecent images of children and 12 of taking indecent 
images.

Delport accepted two
 further charges of indecent assault yesterday – against a victim who 
came forward following his last court hearing – and asked for them to be
 taken into consideration.

Michael
 Haynes, representing Delport, said the GP’s shame was ‘overwhelming’ 
and that he had  let down his wife, friends, patients and church.

Delport had sought treatment for his 'addiction to pornography', his defence said

Since his arrest Delport has sought treatment for his ‘addiction to pornography’.

At
 the time of his arrest, he was presiding over Sunday service at 
Eynsford Baptist Church following the departure of the minister.

A
 source told the Mail: ‘People trusted him with their lives to guide 
them and give them advice when, all along, he was a paedophile.

‘He believed God would talk to him directly about what was wrong with a patient.

‘No one can believe what was actually going on. It is shocking.’

Friends said Delport earned more than £100,000 a year and enjoyed spending his money on golfing holidays, clothes and gadgets.
