Splash: Customers made more than 120,000 complaints to water firms in a year. File picture

Customers made more than 120,000 complaints to water firms in a year, a  report has showed.

A total of 123,218 written complaints were sent to companies between April 1 2013 and March 31 this year - the equivalent of more than 300 every day.

More than half were about billing and charges, the Consumer Council for Water (CCWater) said.

However, the total complaints tally fell by 18 per cent compared to 2012/13.

It was the sixth successive year that the number decreased, and the rate of the fall was twice that seen in the previous year.

Water firms were warned the cost of bills faced by hard-pressed households was still a crucial factor despite improvements.

Tony Smith, chief executive of CCWater, said: 'Most water companies have responded well to our challenge to improve performance, with complaints now at their lowest level since we were formed in 2005.

'But affordability remains a huge challenge for the industry, with one in five customers telling us their water bill is not affordable.

'Water companies and the regulator Ofwat must deliver prices for the next five years that customers can afford and find acceptable or risk a backlash from struggling households.'

Southern Water and South East Water were singled out for being the two worst performing companies when complaints are measured per 10,000 connected properties.

The report said: 'We have repeatedly told them that they need to bring themselves into line with the rest of the industry, but they continue to lag significantly behind.'

Four companies - South West Water, Affinity Water, Severn Trent Water and Dwr Cymru Welsh Water - bucked the industry trend and reported an overall increase in complaints.

Wessex Water, Portsmouth Water and Cambridge Water were hailed as the industry's best performers.

Thames Water, the country's largest water and sewerage company, was said to have responded well to pressure to improve by reducing complaints by almost a third.

Steve George, customer services director at South East Water, said: 'We are pleased to see the downward trend continue during 2014 but we recognise that there is still more to do.

'Over the past year we have been working hard to integrate the new communications technologies into customer service.

'Not only has this new instant approach been welcomed by our customers, our own staff have enthusiastically embraced each development as it has come on board.

'Although our focus is to prevent problems, when things go wrong for our customers we are always sorry and we endeavour to fix things as quickly as possible.

'We're pleased that complaint numbers have reduced by almost 30% again last year - the fourth best improvement in the industry. We will continue to work hard again this year until we're head to head with the best.'

Darren Bentham, Southern Water's chief customer officer, said: 'While our performance in 2013/14 saw a big improvement, we are still lower down the results table than we want to be - and where our customers want us to be.

'However, we are continuing to make changes which ensure we focus on our customers - from training, to new systems and an improved website. These changes are making a huge difference as proved by a significant reduction in written complaints over the past 18 months.

'Our customers have told us they expect better service and we have promised to bring more improvements. There is still work to do but we're confident we can deliver our promise, while ensuring bills are affordable for all.'

A spokesman for South West Water said complaints have dropped by 50 per cent over the last five years.

He said: 'Despite a slight increase in initial complaints in 2013/14 compared to 2012/13, largely due to exceptional weather, more than 97 per cent were resolved first time, which represents the second best performance of all water companies.

'Encouragingly, written complaints this year are lower than the same period last year, reinforcing the overall downward trend in recent years.'

An Affinity Water spokesman said:'Affinity Water is committed to maintaining a high level of customer service. We remain a top five industry performing company, for the fourth consecutive year, with written complaints below half the industry average.

'However, we are not complacent and we are focused on improving our customer experience.'

A Dwr Cymru Welsh Water spokesman said the report shows they had the second lowest volume of customer complaints among the ten water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.

He added: 'However, we did experience a slight increase in the number of complaints received last year compared with 2012-13 and this was mainly due to the warm summer weather which posed challenges in terms of maintaining water supplies in pockets of our operating area.

'Despite this hot dry weather, the plans and measures we put in place meant that our customers did not experience any significant disruptions during this period.'

Water UK, the trade body for the water sector, said the data on complaints was 'great news', adding: 'The industry will continue to work hard to provide the very best services and drive down complaints even further.'
