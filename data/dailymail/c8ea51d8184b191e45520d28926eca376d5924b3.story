A driver lost control of his Cadillac this morning, hurtling across two lawns, ripping down a stop sign and careening into a family's home - before finally coming to a stop in their living room.

Around $175,000 of damage was inflicted upon the home when the allegedly drunk driver smashed into the home in the Southside of Indianapolis at 3.55am on Wednesday.

Miraculously no one inside the home was hurt - and the homeowners' two daughters, aged four and six, even slept through the crash.

Their mother, Danielle Freeman, 26, told Fox59 it was extremely lucky the crash occurred when it did as, just hours earlier, she had hosted a Girl Scouts meeting in the living room.

Damage: A car, driven by an allegedy drunk driver, lost control and crashed through the living room and dining room of an Indianapolis home at 3.55am on Wednesday. No one was hurt in the crash

Wiped out: Authorities guessed that the damage to the property totaled around $175,000

She added that her partner, Michael Martin, was working the night shift and would have arrived home at 7am, when he enjoys to wind down by watching television in the room.

'The whole house shook,' she said.

Freeman ran to the living room - fearing there was a fire as the fire alarms were sounding - and saw the car, but could not reach the two people inside because of the debris.

The crash destroyed the family's living room and kitchen and caused part of the roof to collapse, Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Lt. Bonnie Hensley told the Indianapolis Star.

'The family was just lucky it happened in that part of the house,' Hensley said.

Oops: Police believe the driver, who was traveling with a passenger, could have been drinking

Clean up: The car was removed and thankfully the owners have homeowners insurance

Fire crews worked to remove the debris and placed temporary support beams in the house while pulling the pair out of the car.

The man driving the Cadillac and a woman passenger were alert and talking and taken to Wishard Memorial Hospital for checks and to have blood drawn for alcohol tests.

Police said they suspected alcohol was a factor in causing the crash, the Indy Star reported.

The family had only moved into the home several months ago but thankfully they have homeowners insurance. The family is staying with neighbors until they can return to the home.

The girls were unharmed and their mother said they were most concerned about their toys and their dog, who was also not hurt.
