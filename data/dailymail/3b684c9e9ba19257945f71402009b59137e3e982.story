Veterans of the Second World War were joined by serving soldiers today to launch this year's Poppy Appeal, marking the movement's 90th anniversary.

Troops
from The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of 
Scotland formed a giant 90 at their Glencorse Barracks in 
Penicuik, Midlothian.

The 
event marks the start of the Scottish Poppy Appeal, which uses money 
raised to provide support to veterans of all ages and from all 
conflicts. It also coincides with the official launch of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal in London, fronted by television presenter Gethin Jones.

William Walker, a 90-year-old veteran
who was wounded while serving with the Royal Scots in Burma in 1943, 
was among those who attended the event to launch the appeal.

Mr Walker, from Edinburgh, said: 'I was just a lad when I was shot in World War II and it was a terrifying experience.

'The
Scottish Poppy Appeal was there for our boys then and it is comforting 
to know that it is still here, helping the men and women who are coming 
back from Afghanistan today with terrible injuries.

'The Scottish Poppy Appeal changes lives and I would ask people to be generous when they are buying their poppy this year.'

Last
year, a record Â£2.35 million was collected but Poppyscotland, the 
charity that runs the appeal, said more money needs to be raised as it 
believes there will be an increase in the numbers of veterans needing 
support in the future.

Ian 
McGregor, the charity's chief executive, said: 'When the Scottish Poppy 
Appeal was created in 1921, no-one would have considered that ninety 
years on it would still be needed.

'Sadly,
it is needed as much now as it ever was, with more and more veterans 
requiring a great deal of support to help them deal with often complex 
and multiple needs.

'That's
why we are calling for the Scottish public to give as much as they can 
to the appeal to ensure that veterans and their families, and Scotland, 
will receive the help they need and deserve now and in the future.'

Meanwhile the Royal British Legion's poppy appeal was launched by television presenter Gethin Jones today who was joined by the musical band The Soldiers.

The trio of servicemen - consisting of Lance Corporal Ryan Idzi, Staff Sergant Ritchie Maddocks and Sergeant Major Gary Chilton - have recorded the official Poppy Appeal Song, I've Gotta Get A Message To You.

To mark its 90th anniversary year, 
the Legion launched its Poppy Appeal under the slogan of standing 
'shoulder to shoulder with all who serve'.

The theme is backed by an online campaign and a chart-destined official single recorded by Robin Gibb and The Soldiers.

The appeal will run from October 27 to November 13.
