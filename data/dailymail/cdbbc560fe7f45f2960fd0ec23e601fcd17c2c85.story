NFL bad boy Johnny Manziel was involved a fight during the early hours of Saturday morning after a member of his entourage attacked a fan for trying to hug the rookie quarterback, according to a police report.

Manziel, who has gained a reputation for making headlines for his off-the-field antics, has been relatively quiet since joining the Cleveland Browns after the NFL Draft in May.

But at 2.36 a.m. on Saturday police were called to The 9, the high-end apartment complex where Manziel lives, following a report of a ‘riot’ involving 20 men and two security guards in the lobby.

Chris Gonos, the alleged victim in the incident, told Cleveland Scene that the brawl began when he noticed Manziel while waiting for an elevator.

Gonos said he approached Manziel and said: 'I'm the biggest Browns fan ever, I love you, I want to give you a hug.'

As Gonos stepped toward Manziel, he was punched in the face and beaten by another men with the Browns quarterback, leaving Gonos with a swollen lip and swollen right eye.

‘One of his buddies like tackled me,’ Gonos told the website. ‘It was going down, a whole bunch of people started fighting. It ended pretty quick. I got a bruised hip and a bruised elbow and somebody hit me in the back of the head.’

Gonos said no-one was arrested but his brother ‘tackled’ Manziel and added, ‘I guess Johnny sucker-punched him while the security guard was holding him. It should be all on video.

‘I know somebody else in the group smashed Johnny right in the face. Smashed him.’

Manziel's agent Erik Burkhardt has denied the quarterback was with an entourage.

‘Johnny and his roommate had been out to dinner earlier in the evening with Johnny's mother, who is staying with him this week,' he said in a statement.

‘There was no entourage. Johnny and his roommate were trying to get on the apartment elevator at his home when they were accosted by a very aggressive man and his associates.

'It was an unfortunate situation and he immediately let [Browns general manager] Ray Farmer and the team know what happened.’

Browns general manager Farmer said in a statement the team is looking into the matter.

‘We are aware of the incident and are in the process of gathering additional information in order to gain a complete understanding of what occurred,’ Farmer said.

‘Nonetheless, the time of the incident is concerning to us. We continually stress to all of our players the importance of sound decision-making in an effort to avoid putting themselves in these types of situations. We have addressed this appropriately with the player and will have no further comment at this time.’

The Browns played Sunday in Atlanta, winning on a field goal with the final play of the game.

Manziel, a first-round choice in last May's NFL Draft, was fined by the NFL for making an obscene gesture in a pre-season loss to Washington.
