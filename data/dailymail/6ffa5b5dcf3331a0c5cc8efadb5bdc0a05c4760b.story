Have you ever wondered which company rules in your state?

Well, now you don't have to - thanks to a new revenue map covering all of America's 50 states.

The graphic, designed by telecommunications firm Broadview Networks, reveals the largest companies in each state based on income.

Revealed: This map, designed by telecommunications firm Broadview Networks, reveals the largest companies in each U.S. state based on revenue. The results were taken from every company's corporate headquarters

It shows that Verizon Communications is the biggest company in New York, while the retailer Costco has trumped Microsoft Corporation in Washington.

Although it was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975, Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington, just four years later in a bid to recruit more top programmers.

According to the map, the retailer Wal-Mart is the leading firm in Arkansas, General Motors in Michigan and the Bank of America in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson is the largest company in New Jersey, health care firm CVS Caremark in Rhode Island and chemical company DuPont in Delaware.

The graphic, unveiled in a blog by Broadview, is based on financial information from a Hoover's database of company profiles.

It used the location of each firm's corporate headquarters - excluding any branches or foreign offices - to determine which company is the 'largest' in every state.

When we saw the most recent release of the Fortune 500, it sparked our interest to learn more about who the largest companies by revenue are in each state,' Russ Fordyce, a managing director at Broadview, wrote on the blog.

'We noticed that many states did not have companies included in the list, so we decided to perform our own research to find the largest company by revenue in each state based on the location of the corporate headquarters.'

The map also shows that General Electic is the largest company in Connecticut, Avnet in Arizona, Home Depot International in Georgia, Micron Technology in Idaho, WellPoint in Indiana, Sprint Communications in Kansas and Sanford Health in South Dakota.
