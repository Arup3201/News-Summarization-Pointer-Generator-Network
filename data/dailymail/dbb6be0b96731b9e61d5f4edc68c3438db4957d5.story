Royston Drenthe is not your average footballer. The Reading winger, who is currently on-loan at Sheffield Wednesday, is a video games fanatic and has previously invited eager fans over to his house to play FIFA. 

The Royals wideman took to Instagram to invite local Royals supporters for a game of the popular console game and revealed the winner would receive a 'nice prize'. 

And the Dutchman, who had stints with Feyenoord, Real Madrid and Everton during his career, was once again extolling the virtues of gaming on Monday. 

Drenthe waited patiently in line for the newest edition of 'Call of Duty' and posted images of the event on his Instagram account. 

Who knows, he may invite some lucky Owls fans over to his home for some first-person shooter action in the not too distant future. 

Drenthe starred for the Owls in their recent 1-1 Championship draw with Charlton on Saturday firing in a superb solo effort to put Sheffield Wednesday in front before the Addicks equalised.
