A council has spent taxpayers' money filling in potholes along a road - just days before it was due to be ripped up and resurfaced in a £75,000 scheme.

Chiefs at Blackpool Borough Council filled in craters along Seafield Road and Cambray Road last week to 'avoid costly compensation claims', they said, despite the fact that they are due to undergo major resurfacing this week.

Philip Moore, who lives in Seafield Road, in Blackpool, Lancashire, said: 'We have been told work is due to start this week.

Council bosses have used thousands of pounds of taxpayers' cash to patch up potholes in a road, just days before it was due to be completely ripped up and resurfaced

'So I couldn't believe it when I saw a council workman patching up individual pot holes.

'They were filling up holes when the road is about to be ripped up. It just seems pointless. Why is the council doing this, when there is hardly any money about?

'The roads certainly need resurfacing, but it is a waste of money to be still patching up individual pot holes when they are about to resurface the whole road.'

Workers starting filling in potholes last Saturday and Tuesday - even though the council would be ripping up the carriageway later in the same week.

Shocked residents say were told by highway chiefs they were doing the work due to fears over compensation claims by drivers who hit the potholes.

The council said public safety was another key reason for the work, as well as trying to reduce their previously high level of compensation claims

Betty Wilson, who also lives on the street, said: 'I know the roads have to be repaired but why don't they do it properly?'

Another resident said it created more work and unnecessary inconvenience.

She added: 'When they filled the potholes in, I thought why not do the resurfacing work at the same time?

'They do things back to front - the organisation is all wrong. It just seems to waste people's money.'

The council said public safety was another key reason for the work, as well as trying to reduce their previously high level of compensation claims.

Councillor John Jones, cabinet member for highways on Blackpool Council, said: 'We are always extremely keen to safeguard the public from injury and safeguard taxpayers money too by investing in making repairs.'
