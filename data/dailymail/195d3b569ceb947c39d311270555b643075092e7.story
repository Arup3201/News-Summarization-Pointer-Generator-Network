Novelist Nikesh Shukla came up with a novel concept to promote his new book when he launched a tandoori-cooked lamp chop into space. 

The stunt was done in-line with the similarly named book, Meatspace. 

Getting the chop at an East London Punjabiu restaurant called Tayyabs which carries the lamb as a signature dish, Shukla and graphic artist partner Nick Hearne headed for Costwolds.

There the chop was attached to a helium balloon with a GPS and a camera, Grubstreet reports.

The balloon made it 82,000 feet high before the rig collapsed.

Luckily, the footage survived to show us this chop's-eye-view of the Earth.
