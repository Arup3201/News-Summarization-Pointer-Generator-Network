More than 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘suspect’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the Passport Office. 

These documents could be issued within the next fortnight, sources within Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) claim, despite Home Secretary Theresa May’s vow that security would not be compromised.

The security loophole has been exposed after staff in the HMPO’s ‘Special Security Division’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere.

These highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications.

The problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the Special Security Division.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All hands are being called to the pumps and the Security Division is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties.

‘The Security Division estimates that within the next couple of weeks, because of this panic, there will be at least 1,000 “unsecure” passports issued to “suspect” persons.’

Last week, Theresa May confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from British consulates abroad to an online system based in the UK monitored by HMPO. 

She said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘consistency’ of service. She stressed that security would not be compromised.

But the HMPO source added: ‘At one of the major Passport Office hubs, in Glasgow, they’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world, which have to be checked, double-checked and triple-checked. The Security Division handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny.

‘There is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which Passport Office staff have been trained to recognise.

‘But the Government is drafting in inexperienced Border Agency staff to help. The problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full-time staff.’

The Security Division was set up after it was discovered ‘bulk’ applications mainly by Eastern European gangsters were being made for British passports and a small number had been processed.

As the Glasgow team picked up on the problem, it was decided to base the unit there. Last week, leaked documents from the HMPO revealed a plan to ‘relax’ checks on applications from overseas. The Home Office said it had been ‘unaware’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn.

An HMPO spokesman said: ‘Security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all  necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed.’

Meanwhile, civil servants at HMPO received bonuses worth more than £1.8 million last year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘good performance’ at the service, which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications.

More than 94 per cent received the ‘in-year’ bonus, supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘key business targets’.

Sarah Rapson, the former chief executive, received a bonus worth between £5,000 and £10,000 in 2012/13. On Tuesday the current chief executive, Paul Pugh, will go before the Home Affairs Select Committee to face questioning over the crisis.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence.’
