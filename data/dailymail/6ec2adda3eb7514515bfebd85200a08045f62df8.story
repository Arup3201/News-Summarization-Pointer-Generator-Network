Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea took to Twitter on Wednesday night to show his support to injured Stoke striker Bojan Krkic.

The 24-year-old suffered a cruciate knee injury in his side's FA Cup win against Rochdale on Monday night - ruling him out for the rest of the season as a result.

And friend and former Spain Under 21 team-mate De Gea took to the social networking site to post a selfie of the pair together, while wishing him the best for his recovery ahead.

He attached the comment: 'Giving some affection to one of the best strikers I've ever played with! I hope you recover soon my friend @bokrkic.'

While the pair have never played together at club level, they were also team-mates as Spain finished runners-up in the 2007 Under 17 World Cup.

The former Barcelona forward has scored five goals in 18 appearances since making the move to the Britannia Stadium last summer.
