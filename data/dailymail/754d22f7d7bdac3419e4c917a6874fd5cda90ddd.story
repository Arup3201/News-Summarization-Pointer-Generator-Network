Ronald Koeman can see himself returning to Barcelona as manager one day, but the Dutchman's only focus right now is continuing Southampton's fine form.

Life at the Nou Camp is rocky at the moment, with president Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing on Thursday that elections would be held early in a bid to lift the negative 'tension' around the club.

The term crisis is being bandied around and the Spanish press are reporting rising tensions between head coach Luis Enrique and some of his players, namely Lionel Messi.

Speculation that both could soon be leaving Barca has been knocked back by Bartomeu, while Enrique had denied he was handed an ultimatum by the club.

His position at the helm does, though, look under pressure and Koeman has been installed as the bookmakers' favourite to replace him, thanks to his fine work at Saints and his history with the Catalan giants.

Barcelona list the former defender amongst their 'legends' after a highly-successful spell as a player at the Nou Camp - a place he can see himself returning to as manager, albeit not in the immediate future.

'At teams like Barcelona, if they lose games, there's always a lot of critics, rumours, speculation,' Koeman said.

'I know because my whole life I'm linked to Barcelona, but it's not a time to talk about that, because I think it's not respectful to Southampton as a club, it is not respectful to the people of Barcelona.'

Asked if he could see himself managing the club one day, Koeman said: 'Yes, but I had that [opportunity] sometimes and it never happened.

'Now I'm very happy to be here in Southampton and that's the most important [thing].

'I started with a contract in Southampton and I like to respect to my contract and to the people.'
