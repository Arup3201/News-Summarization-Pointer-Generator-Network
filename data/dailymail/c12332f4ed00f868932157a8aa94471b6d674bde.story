A Florida man shot dead his ex-girlfriend - an avid medieval re-enactor - because she threw him out of the house and verbally abused him.

Scott Stuut, 24, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder and armed burglary.

Grandmother and widow Margaret Gee, 59, was found dead by tenants in her home north of DeLand on March 2.

Killed: Ms Gee was a member of a medieval role-playing group called Shire of Vaca Del Mar and was known as the Honorable Lady Nekhbet Alexandra Selene

Ms Gee had been babysitting her lodgers' 19-month-old son at the time. The child was unharmed.

On her Facebook page, where she 
described herself as a grandmother and widow with a 'Hard-ass that will 
kick you then kiss you', Ms Gee posted an ominous message just before her 
death.

'As of friday [my 
ex-boyfriend] has been kicked out of my house... He has also thretened 
[sic] my life, on my laptop my other roommate found how to use poisons 
primarly injected ones. Like caster been clorene, arsinec and such…All 
of you my friends were right in telling me to get rid of him. Thank the 
higher power that his final plans failed.'

According to WKMG Local 6, when investigators questioned Stuut about the toxins, he said, 'I like to know things. Poisons are something to know.'

He had previously said to detectives: 'Death happens. It's unfortunate that hers was this violent. But, it happens.'

Ms Gee was a high-ranking member of a medieval role-playing group called Shire of Vaca Del Mar – or Cow of the Sea.

She was known as the Honorable Lady Nekhbet Alexandra Selene.

Murder: Scott Stuut, 24, shot his ex-girlfriend, widow and grandmother Margaret Gee, 59, after their relationship ended and she 'verbally abused' him

The non-profit organisation is a chapter of the Society of Creative Anachronism, says the group website, and is 'dedicated to research and recreating pre-17th century European History'.

Activities
listed on the site include, 'Armored Combat, Equestrian Events, 
Costuming, Culinary Arts, Target and Combat Archery, Thrown Weapons, 
Rapier Combat, Merchanting and so much more...'

'Fighter Practice/ Craft Night' is a regular Thursday night fixture.

Ms Gee had suspected that Stuut, who attended some of the group's meetings, may become violent over their break-up.

On Tuesday he told detectives that he entered the house and shot her with a handgun when she verbally abused him.

During the initial questioning, Stuut admitted to being near her home at the time of the killing but said he couldn't remember anything else as he had 'blacked out', reports The Daytona Beach News Journal.

He later said that he was delivering cleaning supplies to the house for the tenants, something the husband and wife renters denied when questioned.

Stella Fullmer, group leader of the Shire of Vaca Del Mar, said that she'd seen Stuut at meetings but he 
wasn't a full member and that she wasn't 'surprised' that Stuut had been
charged.

'Hopefully justice will be done', she said at the time of his arrest.
