A supermarket driver was faced with the most important delivery of his life -Â  when his wife went into labour.

Tesco delivery driver Ben Heppenstall was at home alone with his fiancee Rachel Smith celebrating his birthday on July 18 when she went into labour a month early.

He rang the emergency services who told him he would have to deliver the baby himself - and his experience delivering groceries paid off, as baby Kobi Heppenstall arrived safely into the world to join his father's birthday celebrations.

Mr Heppenstall, 23, of Wigan, Lancashire, said: 'We were having a rest in bed but Rachel kept needing to go to the toilet every ten minutes which unbeknown to us, was a sign that she was starting to go into labour.

'She felt something and asked me to have a look - and I could see it was the baby's head crowning.

'I got her back on the bed and dialled 999 and they said straight away that I was going to have to deliver the baby.

'I put it on speaker phone and because there was only us two in the house I thought to myself, I'm just going to have to get on with it.

Mr Heppenstall delivered the baby on his birthday - and said his new son clearly wanted to join the party

'Rachel gave three pushes and I guided him out.

'It all happened so quickly I didn't have time to worry about it.

'I had just wrapped him up and put him on her chest as the paramedics pulled up outside.

'They clamped the umbilical and then they said, "Here you are, you have done everything else, you might as well cut the cord as well".

Following the home birth, the family went to hospital where a check-up confirmed the baby was healthy.

Mr Heppenstall said: 'All in all it was quite a birthday and he is quite some present from Rachel to me. 'There's no getting away from it - he wanted to join in my party.'
