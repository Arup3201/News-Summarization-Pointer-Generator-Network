Talk about a quick sale! In what might be a new record for an Australian development, a new building in Bondi Junction had sold all its 129 apartments within four hours of going on sale on Saturday - and for an average of about $1million each.

The ink dried on the last contract for Aqua just after midday, with  Colliers International reaping in more than $130million in sales on launch day.

The highest-priced seller was a top-floor, three-bedroom apartment which sold for $2,165,000 and boasts views of the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

The high-demand apartments reflect Leighton Properties' focus on inner-ring urban renewal sites in prime locations, close to transport links, retail and places of work

Muir and Nicole Mathison - who were first in line at the launch day - bought a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a study on the 18th floor.

It boasts a harbour view and cost $16,500 per square metre.

The couple registered their interest in September because they 'saw the colour image of the building and loved the architecture' and saw the location of the apartment as an advantage, having sold their car two years ago.

'We worked out it saved each of us about $5000 a year - and Bondi Junction is so central to everything that it makes getting around easy,' Ms Mathison said.

'We're close to restaurants, shopping and transport, and we expect more and more cafes and eateries to pop up over time.'

Ms Mathison, who was born in Bondi, said the purchase was even more meaningful. Her mother purchased her wedding dress from a store on the site that Aqua is built on.

On the lower end of the scale, a one-bedroom apartment was $585,000, followed by a two-bedroom apartment for $915,000 and a three-bedroom apartment for $2,095,000.

Aqua is the third project Leighton Properties and Qualitas have collaborated on and proved to be the design duo's most popular with more than 2000 registrations of interests in the apartments.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the Bondi Junction apartments were designed by KANNFINCH and DC8 Studio with two sleek towers joined by a garden podium and topped off with rooftop gardens.

Apartments facing north-east have coastal views and those facing north-west look out on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House and the city.

The interiors of the luxury apartments draw from Aqua's near-beach location with kitchen islands shaped like surfboards or waves, and white- or grey-wash timber floors thanks to the creative eye of the award-winning Koichi Takada Architects.

Leighton Properties' national head of residential Gavin Tonnet said the quick sale reflected their 'focus on inner-ring urban renewal sites in prime locations, close to transport links, retail and places of work'.

He also cited the company's other successes Erskineville's Erko where all 41 of its East at Erko apartments sold out in 75 minutes on the release's launch day.

Colliers International general manager of residential David Chittenden said the success of other Bondi Junction developments as well as Aqua's show the high demand of similar projects.

Qualitas' chief executive officer Andrew Schwartz believes the overwhelming response for Aqua could be credited to its location, views and design.

Saturday also saw a lot of buyers around the upper north shore of Sydney keen to buy up at Lindfield's Crimson Hill development.

At its launch of the Canopy Release, 84 per cent of apartments were sold off the plan.

The big draw card for potential owners at Crimson Hill is the close proximity of the location to Chatswood and the train line.

The Canopy Release for the Dunstan Grove precinct saw prices start at $550,000 for a one-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom one for $650,000 and a three-bedder going from $860,000.

Only 20 apartments are available at the development's next release in 2015.

The 345-residence project is backed by Defence Housing Australia and shares a boundary line with Lane Cove National Park.

DHA managing director Peter Howman said he was pleased to see so much interest in the development.

'These are great results â€“ it clearly shows we have entered the market at the right price point and with a product buyers are after,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Saturday saw a bumper day of real estate sales for Sydney, with almost 900 properties going under the hammer.

One of interest was a house in Goodsir Street, Rozelle - where two brothers were murdered in 2009 and was bought for $200,000 above its reserve price by a Byron Bay buyer.

They were on the phone and were represented at the auction by a BresicWhitney agent.

The house is now worth $2,265,000 five years after the cold-blooded attack on Albert and Mario Frisoli. It was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9million, but three registered bidders took the result well past the $2.05million reserve at the on-site auction.

Recently renovated, the Rozelle address includes separate living areas, cathedral ceilings, timber floors, alfresco dining and a self-contained studio at the back.

The interiors of the stunning apartments were overseen by Koichi Takada Architects who put in white- or grey-wash timber floors

One-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments were available, with the top-floor apartment selling for more than $2.1 million
