Lib Dem Cabinet minister Danny Alexander has produced this garish Take A Break-style magazine to promote his election chances

Like all good lifestyle mags, it features family recipes, a crossword and minor celebrities. But 'Talk of the Glens' is a magazine with a difference – it is actually a political campaign leaflet for one of Britain's most high-profile MPs.

Apparently modelled on 'Take a Break', the garish pamphlet is Danny Alexander's secret weapon as he bids to see off a major election challenge from the SNP in his Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey seat.

It contains no fewer than 17 photos of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – including one of him as a young child and several digitally manipulated images of Mr Alexander from the internet.

With the catchline 'true life stories from the Highlands', the magazine includes a recipe for 'Danny's sausage and butternut squash stew' – which includes 'roughly diced' squash but 'finely chopped' onion - and a crossword that offers the prize of a bottle of Dalwhinnie single malt whisky.

As of last night, the Lib Dems had received 16 entries from constituents who solved clues such as: Village near Kilravock Castle (4); Famous Highland actress (5,6); and Caley Thistle all-time top goalscorer (6).

Former LibDem MSP Jamie Stone has an 'exclusive' interview with 'our champion' Danny, while TV presenter Quentin Wilson makes an appearance and Mr Alexander's father Di tells the magazine a 'little bit' about his childhood.

'Our family home on Colonsay had no mains electricity and relied on of diesel generators that ran for just a few hours a day,' he reveals.

There is also a tongue-in-cheek feature on last year's internet 'meme' involving the LibDem Cabinet Secretary, who was photographed strolling on the banks of Loch Morlich in semi-casual attire.

Social media users agreed the snap would make the perfect cover for a contemporary easy listening CD album, and the idea sparked dozens of other doctored images entitled 'Danny Walks' – including the politician walking away from an explosion, landing on the moon and joining the Reservoir Dogs movie line-up.

The first copies of Talk of the Glens were put through letterboxes this week, and the LibDem team is now working on a 'tabloid newspaper' to be handed out before the General Election on May 7.

Mr Alexander has an 8,765 majority in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, however his share of the vote is expected to collapse.

A recent poll from Lord Ashcroft suggests there could be a massive 25.5 per cent swing to the SNP, which has chosen Highland Council leader Drew Hendry as its candidate.

Mr Alexander has admitted he faces a tough challenge.

'I don't really believe the numbers in these local polls but they do reflect a truth, which is that in this constituency, it's going to be a very close battle,' he told online news site Buzzfeed.

'It's very much a head-to-head contest between myself and the Scottish Nationalists. And I don't underestimate that I've got a real fight on my hands.'

The pamphlet includes 'Danny's sausage and butternut squash stew' and quotes from supporters that he is a 'good sport'

There is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former Top Fear host Quentin Willson, and an interview in which Mr Alexander discusses being called a 'ginger rodent' by Labour's Harriet Harman

In keeping with the magazine theme, there is even a crossword that offers the prize of a bottle of Dalwhinnie single malt whisky

In Talk of the Glens, former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy – MP for neighbouring Ross, Skye and Lochaber – adds: 'In government, Danny has delivered for our Highland communities.'

There is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former Top Fear host Quentin Willson, and an interview in which Mr Alexander discusses being called a 'ginger rodent' by Labour's Harriet Harman. 

And in the interview with the minister's father, Di Alexander reveals he was brought up in 'traditional settings', 'prospered' at school' and says 'his heart is truly here in the Highlands'.

Mr Alexander has already faced claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere.

Cash secured for his area includes a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for the sleeper train from London to Scotland and more money to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council. 

Earlier this year, a deal was also secured to hand a 5p petrol rebate to motorists in rural areas, including parts of constituencies represented by LibDem MPs Mr Kennedy, John Thurso, and Mr Alexander.

Last month, UK party leader Nick Clegg unveiled plans to funnel hundreds of millions of pounds through a 'city deal' for Inverness, which he said he wanted to sign-off before the election.

Some £2million was also found to promote the home of the Loch Ness monster.

The Treasury issued a press notice declaring that the 'iconic landmark Loch Ness will benefit from an extra £2million government investment to boost inbound tourism'. 

The campaign promises 'extensive advertising, digital and business to business activity launched in key tourism markets featuring the famed Loch Ness monster until 2019'. 

But Mr Alexander said: 'I think I'm the only MP in the country who gets attacked by his opponents for delivering too much to his constituency.'

SNP candidate Drew Hendry said: 'Here we see the difference between the priorities of the Lib Dems and those of the SNP. 

'Danny Alexander talks about stew and tablet recipes whilst planning a menu of austerity cuts. In more ways than one, people can't stomach what he is offering – which is what is really making him the 'talk of the glens'.

'Unlike the Lib Dems, the SNP have a positive story about our successes in government to tell people in the Highlands and we will never prop up a Tory government - which is why more and more local people are putting their faith in us as we approach the election.' 

Mr Alexander has previously been accused of funelling public money towards his seat in a bid to shore up support.
