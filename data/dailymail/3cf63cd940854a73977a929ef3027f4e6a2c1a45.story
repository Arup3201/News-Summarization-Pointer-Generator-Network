Luciano Becchio is a canny loan signing for Rotherham and was on the scoresheet during a surprise 2-0 win over Blackburn.

The striker, on loan from Norwich, took advantage of a calamitous mix-up in the Rovers defence to tap in the second goal after Kari Arnason had fired in the first.

Victory for Steve Evans' side sees them move up to 17th place in the table on 11 points.
