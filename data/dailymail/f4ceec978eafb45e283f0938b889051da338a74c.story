Coritiba forward Joel’s disastrous goal celebration has somewhat overshadowed his decisive brace in the 3-1 league victory over Sao Paulo.

Leading 2-1 with just a few minutes to go, the 20 year old settled the contest with a strike in the 86th minute. Free of the last defender, Joel confidently rounded the ‘keeper with a cheeky step-over before firing home from close range.

Eager to bask in the adulation and share the moment with the fans, the forward leapt spectacularly over the advertising boards…only to disappear from sight.

But the Cortiba striker soon disappeared out of shot as he fell down a hole leading to a stairwell by the pitch

As it turned out, Joel’s jump saw him tumble down a rather unfortunately placed stairwell.

Ouch.

Security staff rushed to the forward’s aid and after a brief delay, the forward re-emerged with an understandably stunned expression. Despite the fall, Joel was able to complete the ninety minutes and perhaps most importantly, finished his celebration safely within the confines of the pitch.

The victory elevated Coritiba to fifteenth in the table, two points clear of bottom side Vitória.
