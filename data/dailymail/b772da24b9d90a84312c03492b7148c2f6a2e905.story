Stilyan Petrov is back with a ball at his feet and a smile on his face after returning to the pitch as he continues his recovery from leukemia.

Petrov has been turning out for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s in Sunday League and the Celtic and Aston Villa legend, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, is happy to be doing what he does best.

He said: 'It's a good laugh and they're competitive games. It's just really nice to be out there playing a proper game.

Stiliyan Petrov looked happy to be back in action playing for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s

'I've played 90 minutes and my fitness is improving but I need to be patient.' 

Petrov, 35, has played three times for the team managed by former Coventry defender Dave Busst, who suffered a career-ending injury in 1996, and has scored once in a 5-3 cup win.

'Maybe Sky Sports will show it,' Petrov joked. 'As far as positions go, you have to go where you're needed. Sometimes only 12 players are there. 

'The one game, we were winning 2-0 and they had a different man marking me every 10 minutes.' 

The former Celtic and Aston Villa star has played three times for the men from Shirley in the Midlands

Petrov wears the No 10 shirt and has certainly made his mark in the Central Wawrickshire League Premier One Division with his side losing just one of their last three.

Tythe Barn Lane in Shirely is a world away from Parkhead or Villa Park but he's never short of memories.

'I meet a lot of Villa fans and it's great to chat to them, said the man capped 106 times by the Bulgarian national team and who wore the captain's armband representing his country.

Petrov, whose leukemia is in remission, wasn't afraid to get stuck in on his return to football

Petrov admitted he is loving being back in the thick of things on the pitch with Wychall Wanderers

'I do get asked for autographs and pictures after matches. The supporters have been great and I always had a positive attitude.' 

With the disease in remission, Petrov added: 'Everything is fine, touch wood. There are only three months to go on tablets and I'm finished. I'm on steroids until January.

'I'll be there again on Sunday but don't ask me who we're playing.'

Wanderers' secretary John Busst - Dave's dad - paid a glowing tribute to Petrov.

'The most amazing thing is that he's such a lovely, down-to-earth chap. He comes along, pays his subs and has a drink with the lads. 

'He is amazing. Players of that class, such is their footballing brain, they are three or four moves ahead even if they are only 40 or 50 per cent fit.

'He scored, and it was a good goal. On Sunday, we won our first league game 2-1 and he made both goals.'

Petrov officially announced his retirement from the professional game in May 2013 and had a short spell working as a coach with the Villa Under 21 team.

Petrov did a lap of honour at the end of the 2012-13 season at Villa Park and also had a charity match last year at Celtic Park with a host of stars, including Hoops legend Henrik Larsson, turning out in support
