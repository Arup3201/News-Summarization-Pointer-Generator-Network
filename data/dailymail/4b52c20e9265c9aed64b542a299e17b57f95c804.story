Gloria Hunniford showed off her weight loss, and outfit on the Pride of Britain awards red carpet

Appearing on the red carpet, Gloria Hunniford cut an impressively svelte figure.

But her bright smile and glamorous outfit on Monday night at the Pride of Britain awards disguised the dramatic health scare she underwent earlier this year which prompted her weight loss.

The veteran TV presenter, 73, was diagnosed with blood poisoning and in hospital for ten days on an oral antibiotic and two intravenous ones after slicing through her left index finger with a knife as she cleaned meat from a lamb bone.

At the time of the accident, Miss Hunniford believed she had a superficial cut that needed nothing more than a plaster.

Two days later however her hand was three times its normal size, hours later she was feverish and found she had an ‘ominous weal’ running up the inside of her left arm almost to her armpit.

Taken to A&E by her husband of 15 years, celebrity hairdresser Stephen Way, doctors immediately hooked her up to a drip and IV antibiotics.

In an interview in May Miss Hunniford revealed: ‘It was a bit of a shock as I am pretty healthy in general and had no idea that this sort of thing could happen from a simple nick to the finger.

‘Doctors said it was just one of those things but that bacterial infections from raw or cooked meat are the worst.

‘Apparently if someone gets playfully scratched by a cat, they should be careful, as those sorts of wounds can develop into infections.

‘When I first arrived at hospital I did ask a doctor if my kind of infection could be serious and his reply was that before antibiotics had been discovered, people died of this type of blood poisoning, which was sobering.

‘In my right arm, which the IV needle was going onto, I developed cellulitis – an infection under the skin – which needed treating as well.’

In order to restore her health Miss Hunniford decided to embark on a no sugar, no carbs diet and also took multivitamins and probiotics.

She described her new eating plan as a ‘bit like the New Atkins. I feel a lot better on that kind of diet as it stabilises blood sugar levels.’

Last night a spokeswoman for Miss Hunniford said: ‘Gloria has always looked after herself well and her message has always been about being healthy, especially as she gets older.

'She eats well, she takes probiotics and multivitamins and she exercises as well. She’ll do a bit of working out, a bit of walking. Her health is very important to her.’
