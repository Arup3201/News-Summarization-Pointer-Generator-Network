When George North burst onto the international scene against South Africa in November 2010, the rugby world knew there was a new superstar in town.

North has terrorised defences for the four past four seasons with his terrifying mixture of power and speed.

The Northampton winger tips the scales at 16 stone and nine pounds but he can sprint 40 metres in 4.97 seconds. 

Wales winger George North is a freakish specimen and one of the new breed of monstrous outside backs 

BREAKFAST: Toast, four eggs, curly kale, porridge

LUNCH: Chicken, rice, veg, yoghurt

afternoon snack Salmon, sweet potato, salad

DINNER: Cottage pie, mashed potato, veg, fruit salad

SNACKS: Peanut butter sandwich, nuts, fruit

GUILTY PLEASURES: Chewy sweets, gammon and chips, Indian takeaway

ALCOHOL? Allowed a drink, but won’t touch a drop during the Six Nations 

That puts North up there with three of the world's fastest sports stars in the form of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (4.82 seconds), Springbok flyer Bryan Habana (4.77 seconds) and Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt (4.65 seconds).

The British and Irish Lions winger, who famously carried Wallabies winger Israel Folau on his back during the second Test in Melbourne, can bench press 353lb (64 house bricks) and squat 496lb (equivalent to a large male gorilla). 

North has to eat a lot to maintain his size and stats in the gym. The former Scarlets flyer consumes almost 4,300 calories a day. That’s nearly twice the recommended daily intake for a man (2,500). He could easily reach this with 8.8 Big Macs.
