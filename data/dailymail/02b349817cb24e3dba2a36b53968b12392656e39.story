A police officer risked his own life to save a suspected drunk driver after the man ran on to a busy freeway and laid down in the road during a traffic stop.

Patrolman Matt Beck was forced to run into the path of oncoming cars and drag 340lb Richard Solis across three lanes of traffic by himself during a routine stop in Ohio.

A dash-cam video taken from Beck's patrol car captures the moment that Solis, 54, runs from his vehicle and into the road, before Beck manages to rescue him.

Police officer Matt Beck risked his life to rescue 340lb drunk driving suspect Richard Solis after he ran into the middle of a busy highway and laid down in the road

The incident began on July 10 after Solis was pulled over for driving erratically. But after pulling over at the side of the road, Solis runs into traffic shouting 'kill me, kill me'

Solis, 54, then laid down in front of oncoming traffic, apparently waiting for a vehicle to run him over

The incident began before 11am on July 10 when Beck stopped Solis while he was driving along the I-480 near North Olmsted.

Footage shows Solis pulling over to the side of the road, before leaping out of his vehicle and running on to the highway while cars and heavy trucks speed past.

Beck shouts at Solis to get back into his car, while the suspect can be heard yelling: 'Kill me, kill me.'

The pair disappear from the frame, but reappear again as Beck hauls Solis's body across three lanes to the side of the road.

Patrolman Beck was forced to run into oncoming traffic and drag Solis to safety by himself as backup had not arrived on the scene yet

After the incident, Detective Sergeant Bob Wagner praised officer Beck, saying he did a 'great job'

According to WKYC TV, Detective Sergeant Bob Wagner said: 'We are very happy with the way he handled the situation. He did a great job.

'He was waiting for backup and they weren't there yet so he pulled the man to safety all by himself.'

Solis has been charged with driving under the influence and speeding.
