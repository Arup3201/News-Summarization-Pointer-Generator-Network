It is common knowledge that illicit drugs are bad for your health, but a new series of GIFs show the devastating toll that controlled substances take on people battling addiction.

The GIFs are part of a project titled Faces of Addiction, which has been put together by Rehabs.com - an educational organization dedicated to raising awareness of substance abuse.

Unlike the more common before/after photos, these GIFs allow the viewer to follow the gradual physical decline of more than a dozen men and women.

Startling change: In 1997, this woman was arrested for possession of methamphetamine (left). In 2013, she was photographed for another mugshot looking much older than her 59 years  

The project includes 13 unnamed individuals who have been arrested over the years on various drug charges involving methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin or pain pills.

'The pursuit of a drug habit can cost these people everything – their friends and family, their home and livelihood. And nowhere is that impact more evident than in the faces of addicts themselves,' states the website.

The shocking effects of drug abuse on display here run the gamut from open sores and skin lesions to missing teeth to severe facial wasting heralding premature aging.

The statement posted on the site points out that beyond the direct effects of substance abuse, people suffering from addiction often fall into a ruinous pattern of self-neglect because taking care of one’s health and appearance becomes secondary to obtaining drugs at any cost.

Ravaged: The 'before' booking photo taken in 2009 (left) shows a heavyset, ruddy man with a beard. Five years later, his toothless mouth like a crumpled origami and his lined are cheeks sallow and sunken

'The consequences of addiction can remain etched in their very skin for years,' the project states.

One of the GIFs focuses on a woman who begins her journey down the path of drug addiction in 2004 as a relatively fresh-faced 33-year-old. 

A decade later, she emerges as a withered, prematurely aged 43-year-old with a glass eye and sores on her forehead.

Striking: This 43-year-old woman was arrested on a charge of drug paraphernalia possession. Ten years later, she has a glass eye and sores on her bedraggled face  

Blink of an eye: This is what happened to a 23-year-old pain pill addict over the course of a single year 

It is hard to believe that this woman arrested on a drug paraphernalia charge is only 31 years old

Empty shell: A 32-year-old man arrested for selling methamphetamine appears to be twice his age, his teeth missing and his nose shattered

The mugshot on the left was made in 2009. The 31-year-old alleged heroin addict was booked into jail again earlier this year (right)

More than 14 years of cocaine use turned this 64-year-old addict into a wrinkled old man

Drug use is often accompanied by self-neglect, as exemplified by this 24-year-old drug suspect 

The series Faces of Addiction was created to show the physical transformation of people suffering from substance abuse 

Breaking bad: In a matter of four years, this 44-year-old man accused of cooking meth appeared before a camera with his face covered in open sores

Premature aging: This woman, age 52, was arrested for possession of cocaine. The 'before' photo was taken in 2004, and the 'after' in 2013 

Addicts often suffers from skin lesions and open sores that do not heal. This woman is only 30 years old

A 32-year-old man arrested for selling methamphetamine appears to be twice his age, his teeth missing and his nose shattered.

One of the more shocking sequences in the series involves a 46-year-old addict arrested for possession of cocaine. The 'before' booking photo taken in 2009 shows him as a heavyset, ruddy man with a full beard.

Five years later, he is a shell of a man, his toothless mouth like a crumpled origami and his lined cheeks sallow and sunken.

An equally startling transformation occurrs in a female addict, who at age 59 looks to be in her 70s

The GIF shows her wasting away over the course of 16 years, losing most of her teeth and hair, with every inch of her face lined and creased.

Perhaps one of the more eye-opening examples of the ravages of drugs involves a 23-year-old woman arrested for possession of painkillers.

Over the course of a single year, the woman was arrested at least six times, Her latest booking photo taken this year shows her disfigured by open sores covering her forehead, nose and chin.

A disclaimer on the page notes that the photos ‘do not necessarily show the direct result of drug abuse or addiction.

‘Rather, they depict the physical deterioration of individuals who have been involved in repeated arrests, and serve as a startling visual timeline – with appearances profoundly altered as a consequence of life impacted by drugs or drug-related crime.’

Rehbas.com is committed to helping people dealing with substance abuse find treatment programs around the country.

In 2013, more than 24million people reported that they had abused illicit drugs or prescription pills in a single month, according to the site.
