It's Hot or Not time again as IAN LADYMAN reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

WHAT'S HOT 

WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS

Barely a week goes by without a minute’s silence or a round of applause at a football ground. There is slightly too much of it. In the Black Country in the ‘90s, though, Jack Hayward revived a great institution almost on his own. His recent passing was marked superbly by Wolves this week. They will miss him.

Former Wolves owner Sir Jack Hayward funeral took place on Tuesday, with many paying their last respects

LEE WESTWOOD

The Ryder Cup star’s passionate condemnation of the R&A’s decision to hand the Open to SKY was brave and welcome, bettered in its eloquence only by Sportsmail’s own Derek Lawrenson. It should be noted, though, that Lee, and others, live in Florida these days and play most of their golf on the PGA Tour of America. Shown every weekend on SKY.

LOUIS VAN GAAL’S ENGLISH

The Manchester United manager has an admirable command of the language but on occasions listening to him can be more entertaining than watching his team play. This week, for example, he described Marouane Fellaini as a 'long player', which is some kind of record….

ROY HODGSON

Sometimes your horizons brighten without you actually doing anything. England haven’t played since November but in that time Charlie Austin, Harry Kane and Danny Ings have joined the queue for a place against Lithuania. If Hodgson fails to pick them, we should all make alternative plans for the summer of 2016.

WHAT'S NOT

ANDY CARROLL

Carroll is occasionally a striker for West Ham and last week gave a rather sour interview, criticising Brendan Rodgers’ treatment of him at Liverpool. Carroll was not Anfield standard and it was Rodgers’ job to manage him out of the club, which he did. Carroll’s job now is to play football. You may have noticed that he is currently injured. Again.

JURGEN KLOPP

Bottom of the Bundesliga, Dortmund manager Klopp doubtless remains a good coach but will understood now that you can only buck trends for so long, especially while selling your best players. Eventually the ground shifts beneath every manager’s feet and it’s good to get out before it does. Only the stubborn – and Arsene Wenger – don’t see this.

THE RFU

The knives are out for Sam Burgess with one correspondent describing him as a ‘novice’ after the rugby league convert’s modest showing for the Saxons last weekend. Of course he’s a novice, which makes attempts to fast track him full tilt towards the England squad both ridiculous and desperate.

ROY KEANE

At his Dublin book launch last autumn, football’s greatest warrior wore a beard and cord jacket. He looked like a geography teacher but at least he was working. Now – post-Aston Villa - he’s got time on his hands and police are investigating an alleged row with a taxi driver. Please get another job, Roy.
