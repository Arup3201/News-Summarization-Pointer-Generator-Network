A jury took less than an hour to find a woman guilty on Tuesday in the 2011 starvation death of her ten-year-old stepson.

The Dallas County jury found Elizabeth Ramsey, 33, guilty of intentional serious injury to a child in Johnathan Ramsey's death. The child weighed just 60lb when he died and in desperation, had eaten his own feces.

Jurors will hear testimony today in the sentencing phase of Ramsey's trial and could sentence her to a maximum of life imprisonment.

Elizabeth Ramsey, 33, was found guilty of starving to death her ten-year-old stepson in Texas and faces life in prison

The boy's 35-year-old father, Aaron Ramsey, is serving a life sentence already.

Prosecutors said the two locked the boy in his room at the family's Dallas, Texas home, then slowly starved him on a diet of bread and water or milk and dumped his emaciated body in a rural area south of Dallas in 2011. The body was found the next year in a creek.

The stepmother's attorneys asserted that her husband kept her from reporting her stepson's ordeal.

Ramsey's lawyers had asked jurors to find her guilty of a lesser charge, arguing that Aaron Ramsey was the instigator and she was forced to participate in the crime.

Prosecutors blamed the couple equally for Johnathan’s death. Witnesses described Elizabeth Ramsey as a habitual liar with a hot temper.

Johnathan Ramsey was starved for months by his stepmother and father until his tiny body gave out in 2011. The pair then dumped the child in a rural area, south of Dallas

Johnathan's grandfather, Edward Ramsey, 
had contacted police early in 2012 to ask them to search for the child 
because he had not seen the boy for more than a year.

The boy's biological mother, Judy Williams, and other relatives did not see him for months.

Williams lives in New Mexico and has custody of the couple's other son, according to relatives.

Police said Aaron and Elizabeth Ramsey, the child's stepmother, initially claimed the boy had gone to live with his mother but later confessed to starving the boy to death.

According to police, Aaron Ramsey said he put his son on 'military rations' because the boy began to misbehave early last year. 

Ramsey said the boy had punched his stepmother in the stomach when she was pregnant, causing a miscarriage.

Johnathan’s schoolteacher Carrie Liska said that the child was never violent but quiet and sweet. 

She
 told the Dallas News that Johnathan didn't play much with other 
children which could be attributed to his Asperger syndrome.

Ramsey said he hit Johnathan in the chest and then locked him in a bedroom, according to the records.

Jurors in Elizabeth Ramsey's trial heard testimony that Ramsey was not pregnant after all.

Relatives told Dallas News on Monday that Elizabeth Ramsey was known for making up lies, at one point claiming to be an FBI agent and earning her doctorate at college.

Elizabeth Ramsey grew up believing that her mother was her sister after she was adopted by her maternal grandparents as a baby.

Her biological mother Kathleen Pate, who blew kisses to Ramsey from the stand, told the court on Monday that her daughter lied frequently and had a very short temper, according to the Dallas News.  

Johnathan was found lying on the bedroom floor in August, according to court records.

Aaron Ramsey told detectives he changed his son into his favorite T-shirt, placed him into a sleeping bag and inserted a dryer sheet to mask the smell of his body, the records said.
