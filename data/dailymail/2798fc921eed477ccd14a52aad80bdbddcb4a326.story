A couple are gearing up for a landmark divorce battle over their miniature dachshund called Joey.

The case, set to be heard in New York, is the state's first ever matrimonial pet-custody case.

Shannon Louise Travis, 32 and her estranged wife Trisha Bridget Murray have worked a divorce settlement which is satisfactory on both sides apart from one small detail: who gets the dog?

Court papers tell how Travis bought Joey as a gift to Murray after she insisted her then-girlfriend get rid of the cat she owned.

As part of her case, Murray will argue that the dog is her property, because she bought it and also because she is more close to Joey than her wife.

Murray substantiates this claim by insisting that Joey sleeps on her side of the bed.

Speaking to the New York Post, Murray said: 'I consider this puppy, my little angel Joey, the love of my life.

'He is my little soul mate, and there was no way in this lifetime I could ever live without him.'

Presiding Justice Matthew Cooper, said the case was unsurprising in a 'canine-centric city where dogs play an ever more important role in our emotional lives'.

According to the judge, New York's pet laws are not as comprehensive as other states.

The Post reported that an Alabama judge awarded a dog named Preston after considering the dog's 'best interests' a term usually found in child custody cases.

Judge Cooper has now scheduled a hearing where he plans to investigate the circumstances of the dog's ownership rather than awarding him like a piece of property.

The court session will establish who is most attached to the dog by finding out who spends more time with him.

He will ask the pup’s mothers to answer questions similar to those posed during child custody trials such as: “Who spent more time with Joey on a regular basis?”

The parties are currently working out a date for the hearing, neither were available for comment.
