Syria's First Lady made a public appearance for the first time in months at an event in Damascus - dispelling rumours that she had fled her war-torn nation to safety abroad.

British-born Asma Assad brought her two sons Hafez, 11, and Karim, eight, and her daughter Zein, nine, along to the Mothers of Martyrs event at the opera house in the capital, according to the President's office.

She greeted a crowd of women and children with Syrian flags painted on their faces at the charity event, in aid of the mothers of dead soldiers.

Asma al-Assad made a rare public appearance at the Mothers of Martyrs in the Damascus Opera House, dispelling rumours she had fled Syria or that she was expecting her fourth child

Syria's first lady had not been seen in public for some months and had been rumoured to be in the United Arab Emirates with her husband's mother and sister

Mrs Assad had not appeared in public for months prior to the event and Syrians suspected she had fled abroad with her children to escape the violence after fighting reached Damascus.

President Assad's mother, Anisa Maklouf, and sister, Bushra, whose husband was killed in a bombing last July, are reported to have fled to the United Arab Emirates.

Speculation had also mounted in recent months that Mrs Assad was heavily pregnant, after a Lebanese newspaper reported she was expecting her fourth child.

The absence of Asma Assad's from the public eye was originally thought to signify her disapproval of President Assad's violent regime

But as images of the President's wife showed her smiling in a jostling crowd she did not show signs of pregnancy.

The 37-year-old wife of President Assad was known as Emma among friends when she was brought up in the UK.

Born to Syrian parents, cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and his former diplomat wife Sahar Otri al-Akhras, she grew up in Acton, West London.

She was privately educated in Marylebone and graduated from Kings College London before working for a merchant bank and marrying President Assad in 2000.

She became known for her support of good causes and when she disappeared from the public eye after the uprising two years ago many thought this was a sign she disapproved of her husband's barbaric dictatorship.

But leaked emails obtained by the Mail last July showed Mrs Assad went on a £270,000 online shopping spree as Syrian soldiers and rebels were dying in a violent war under her husband's rule, while one million more became refugees.

Her order – which included five 
chandeliers costing £8,800 – was sent to upmarket furniture store DN Designs in 
the King’s Road, Chelsea, West London.

The number of refugees to have fled to camps like Al Zaatari Syrian in Mafraq, Jordan, reached one million in recent weeks
