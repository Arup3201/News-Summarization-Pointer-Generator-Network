A British man has been arrested in Spain after allegedly calling police officers at the Gibraltar border 'torturers' and publishing pictures of them on the internet.

The man, named by Spanish media as Emilio Esteban, launched the verbal assault on a website in retaliation for long queues at the Gibraltan border caused by security checks.

He was arrested in Madrid yesterday afternoon.

In the statement, Esteban allegedly said: 'Here are The Faces of Spanish Border ... 'TORTURERS'

'They
 look like ordinary men and women but these "criminals" are the people 
who, according to Gibraltarians, have "tortured" innocent tourists and 
travellers.'

Using a Spanish slag word for protest, the post added: 'You don't have to be a victim of police abuse. Escrache the Guardia Civil!'

Queues at the Gibraltar boarder have been caused by increased security checks the Spanish claim are to prevent smuggling

People have been forced to wait in their cars for hours in blistering summer heat

The border checks have been in place since July causing hours of tailbacks in blistering summer heat and sparking a diplomatic row.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo has said he supports Argentina over the Falklands and wants Gibraltar to be 'decolonised' too

The Spanish claim they are to prevent smuggling but many believe they have been imposed in protest at Gibraltar's decision to build an artificial reef in contested waters off the coast.

There have been reports of stones being thrown at boarder guards and insults being shouted.

It is not known if Esteban comes from Gibraltar, where many Britons have Spanish names, but police revealed he has pleaded not guilty.

Jorge Fernandez Diaz, Spain's interior minister, said the post was 'an intolerable attack on security forces and the rule of law.'

The news came on the same day that the Spanish foreign minister offered his support for Argentina's bid to win back control of the Falkland Islands.

Speaking while on a trip to Uruguay Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said the similarities between the two were 'enormous' and that both needed to be 'decolonised'.

He also criticised Britain for siding with the 30,000 inhabitants, most of whom say they like British rule, though added that he would welcome a discussion on the issue any time.
