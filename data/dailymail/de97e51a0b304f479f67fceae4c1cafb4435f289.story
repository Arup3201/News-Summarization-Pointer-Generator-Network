A desperate victim of ‘locked-in’ syndrome broke down in tears yesterday after losing his landmark legal battle for the right to end  his life when he chooses with a doctor’s help.

Tony Nicklinson had to be comforted by his wife Jane, who said her husband was ‘absolutely heartbroken’.

Mr Nicklinson said he had been condemned by the law to ‘a life of increasing indignity and misery’.

Pain: Mr Nicklinson is comforted by his wife after the decision today. She has supported him in his quest to win the right to die at home

The 58-year-old father of two from Melksham, Wiltshire, is mentally sound but paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak.

For the past seven years he has not 
been able to move anything apart from his head and eyes following a 
severe stroke while on a business trip to Athens.

His only means of 
communication is via a computer triggered by blinks and head movements.

Mr Nicklinson has been battling for 
two years to persuade three judges at the High Court to rule that if, 
and when, he decides he wants to die, doctors will be immune from 
prosecution if they help him.

Yesterday they gave him the 
devastating news that only Parliament can change the law of murder so 
that doctors or helpers can step in to assist someone to die.

Harrowing: The pain clear to see, Tony Nicklinson breaks down in tears today after being told that he will not be granted the right to die

Mr Nicklinson today vowed to appeal the decision, despite the 'physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish' this will bring him and his family

Heartache: Mr Nicklinson cries at the computer he uses to speak through. He was once an active man but has become incapable of even basic tasks after his stroke

The judges
 said that if no doctor was allowed to help Mr Nicklinson die, then his 
only option would be to die by starvation.

The ruling means that 
58-year-old Mr Nicklinson faces decades entirely dependent on others to 
care for his every need.

However his wife said they would appeal. She and their grown-up daughters Lauren and Beth all support his legal battle.

Speaking through his computer, Mr Nicklinson said: ‘I am devastated by the court’s decision.

‘Although I didn’t want to raise my 
hopes, it happened anyway because a fantastic amount of work went into 
my case and I thought that if the court saw me as I am, utterly 
miserable with my life, powerless to do anything about it because of my 
disability, then the judges would accept my reasoning that I do not want
 to carry on and should be able to have a dignified death.

‘I am saddened that the law wants to condemn me to a life of increasing indignity and misery.’

Mrs Nicklinson, 56, said: ‘Tony has to either carry on like this until he dies of natural causes or  starves himself.’

Right-to-life campaigners said the 
ruling would protect the vulnerable from pressure to commit suicide or 
from involuntary euthanasia.

Mr Nicklinson’s case was a joint one 
with a 47-year-old known only as Martin because his family wishes to 
preserve their privacy.

He suffered a stroke four years ago and is unable to speak or move, except for small movements of his head and eyes.

Lord Justice Toulson, sitting with Mr 
Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur, rejected the claim of both men that
 they should be allowed help with death under Article Eight of the 
European human rights charter, which guarantees the right to private and
 family life.

Martin’s claim that the Director of 
Public Prosecutions must be asked to publish new guidelines allowing 
others to help him die was also rejected.

Mr Nicklinson shares a rare moment of laughter with Jane. He wants to die at home surrounded by his friends and family rather than thousands of miles away at a legal clinic

Ruling halts the rush to change law

Lord Justice Toulson described the men’s cases as ‘tragic’.

He said their plight was ‘deeply 
moving’, but added: ‘Their desire to have control over the ending of 
their lives demands the most  careful and sympathetic consideration, but
 there are also other important issues to consider.

'A decision to allow 
their claims would have consequences far beyond the present cases.

‘It is not for the court to decide 
whether the law about assisted dying should be changed and, if so, what 
safeguards should be put in place.

‘Under our system of government these 
are matters for Parliament to decide, representing society as a whole, 
after Parliamentary scrutiny, and not for the court on the facts of an 
individual case or cases.’

The judge said Mr Nicklinson ‘wants to be 
able to choose to end his life by voluntary euthanasia.’

‘This does not mean that he 
necessarily wants to end his life immediately.

'At the moment he thinks 
that he would probably wish to end it in a year or two, but he wants to 
establish the right to die with dignity at a time of his choosing’.

He added that because Martin ‘finds his current life unbearable, he wishes to end it as soon as possible’.

However, Martin’s wife, a nurse, was 
unwilling to help him die.

'His options under current law are either to 
travel to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich to get help with suicide, or to 
starve himself.

Mrs Nicklinson said her husband was reluctant to go to the  Dignitas clinic.

‘We could do Switzerland but it’s very
 expensive and he doesn’t see why the hell he should have to go to a 
foreign country to die in the middle of an industrial estate,’  she 
said.

Right-to-life campaigner Dr Andrew 
Fergusson of the Care Not Killing Alliance said the ruling ‘confirms the
 simple truth that the current law exists to protect those without a 
voice: the disabled, terminally ill and elderly, who might otherwise 
feel pressured into ending their lives.’

He added: ‘It confirms the view that 
even in a free democratic society there are limits to choice. Every law 
limits choice and stops some people doing what they might desperately 
wish to do, but this is necessary in order to protect others, especially
 the most vulnerable in our society.

‘Hopefully the decision to reject both
 cases will now draw a line once and for all under legal debate and 
allow decision-makers and society to focus attention on how we care for 
the terminally ill and severely disabled.
