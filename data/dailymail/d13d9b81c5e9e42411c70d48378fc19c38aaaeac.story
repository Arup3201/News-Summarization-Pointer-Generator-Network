Swansea City have 'reluctantly' accepted an FA charge against Jonjo Shelvey for elbowing Liverpool's Emre Can on Monday. 

It means the midfielder will now be handed a three-match ban for violent conduct and a further one-match suspension because it is his second red card of the season. 

Shelvey initially went unpunished for the clash with Can, despite it occurring directly in front of referee Andre Marriner.

Swansea have been left infuriated that while Shelvey has been sanctioned, Raheem Sterling escaped punishment for an equally obvious infringement in Liverpool's 4-1 win.

A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City has reluctantly accepted the charge issued by The Football Association against Jonjo Shelvey for violent conduct following an incident in Monday night's Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool.

'The Football Association said the incident with Liverpool's Emre Can, which happened in front of the referee, 'was not seen by the match officials but caught on video'.

'While the club supports Shelvey's statement that the incident was unintentional, it does not believe the outcome of an appeal would prove positive for the club or player.'

Shelvey took to Twitter to explain what happened and insisted he would not set out to hurt an opponent

Swansea boss Garry Monk also defended Shelvey, saying: 'I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all. He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away.

'I don't think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed. No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn't warrant any more action and the game went on.'

After Shelvey was booked in the Boxing Day win against Aston Villa, Monk said: 'I have spoken to him a number of times. We can't afford silly bookings and Jonjo has to wise up because that yellow card came from laziness and he has to be better than that.'

But Monk said he had no intention to sell Shelvey - who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million in the summer of 2013 - in the January transfer window.

'It is often the case (to sell) when a manager talks about a player,' said Monk.

'But that is absolutely not the case. It was not my intention to give the impression I do not want Jonjo here.

'When I talked about him I was talking about the specific instances where he can do better, in relation to the yellow cards he has picked up.

'He is going to get a lot better and I want that to happen here at Swansea, not anywhere else.'
