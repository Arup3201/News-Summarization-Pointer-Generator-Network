Official data found full-time women earned more than their male colleagues in their 20s and early 30s

WOMEN now earn more than men until they turn 35, when the tables are turned, new figures show.

Official data found full-time women earned more than their male colleagues in their 20s and early 30s.

But at the age of 35, the trend is reversed and men then earn more money for the rest of their working life.

The gender pay gap then widens in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Experts said women were often punished for having children by finding themselves locked out of promotions and pay rises, despite returning full-time and to the same role.

At the age of 30, UK women working full-time earn 81p an hour more than men on average.

By 34, this has narrowed to 58p more, but just a year later, men are out-earning women by 9p an hour.

By the time they reach 40, the average man is earning a shocking £1.64 an hour more.

It is the first time the figures have been broken down year by year to show the exact age at which the gender pay gap switches.

Ann Francke, of the Chartered Management Institute, said employers were still guilty of ‘unconscious bias’ and women were still overlooked for pay rises, bonuses and promotions.

She added that companies were still dismissing mothers who returned to work as somehow less ambitious or capable, saying: ‘Employers must not assume that because someone has had a baby, they cannot be given a challenging role.

‘Companies should be flexible but also make sure that women are given the responsibility and a role where they can get results.’

The CMI said women over 40 are paid 35 per cent less than their male colleagues for doing the same role.

Ms Francke said: ‘In the managerial sector, the gender pay gap appears between the age of 35 and 40 as women just slide off the pay scale.

‘Women generally perform better at school and are more likely to go to university, then out-earn men at the start of their careers.

But at the age of 35, the trend is reversed and men then earn more money for the rest of their working life

‘But as their careers progress, their pay begins to falter.’

She said male executives had a responsibility to try to close the gender pay gap, including tracking any differentials in pay among their own workers.

Frances O’Grady, of the Trades Union Congress, also called for more to be done to tackle the gender pay gap.

She said: ‘We all expect our wages to increase as our careers progress.

‘But women's wages start to stagnate as early as their mid-30s when many have young children to look after.

‘If we want to end this motherhood pay penalty, employers need to offer women more options for flexible working.

‘And we need to ensure that dads play a bigger role after their child is born by increasing paternity pay and introducing some father-only leave.

‘International evidence shows that mothers’ annual earnings increase if their partner takes longer parental leave.’

A new law was introduced last month which allows men to share up to 50 weeks of parental leave with their partners if their child is born or adopted after March 31 this year.

It means that instead of taking just two weeks’ of statutory paternity leave, fathers can now take up to a year off to care for their newborn baby.

Labour has also announced it would increase paid leave for new fathers from two to four weeks, as well as putting up statutory paternity pay by more than £120, to £260 a week.

However, this plan has been attacked by small businesses who claim many firms would struggle to shoulder the extra expense.

Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan said: ‘I am delighted that the gender pay gap is at its lowest ever level, and that for women under 40 in full time work it has disappeared.

‘However there is more to be done and we still need to get more women into the best-paid sectors.

‘To tackle the remaining gender pay gap for women over 40, we are working to remove the barriers that stop women entering senior leadership roles and supporting those women who wish to, to combine work with family life.

‘This includes introducing shared parental leave, extending the right to flexible working, and introducing tax-free childcare – which will benefit almost 2 million working families.’
