Convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky will be allowed to keep the more than $900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison.

Because of the bylaws of the Pennsylvania state employee's retirement system, the former football coach will keep the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned following his 1999 retirement from Penn State University's sports program.

The state's forfeiture law does not authorize the government body to go after money paid before the date of a plea or conviction, meaning he will keep everything awarded between 1999 and September 2012.

Payments stopped: Jerry Sandusky will be allowed to keep the more than $900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison

That said, the agency notified Sandusky he will no longer continue to receive the payments, which amount to $59,000 annually.

Sandusky's lawyer says the former Penn State assistant football coach will fight to keep his pension.

The decision to revoke his pension- which breaks down to $4,908 per month- was unveiled in a letter to Sandusky, 68, dated October 9.

That was the same day he was sentenced in Pennsylvania Common Pleas Court to prison for 30 to 60 years for molesting 10 boys.

The move by SERS, a state retirement plan for public employees, means Sandusky loses his entire pension, including a sum to his wife Dottie when he dies, according to the letter first published by the Centre Daily Times of State College, Pennsylvania, where Penn State, a public university, is located.

Dottie, who was mentioned in the court case as one of the victims said that he screamed during the abuse because he knew that Mrs Sandusky was in the home, came back into the spotlight this week as she and her husband co-signed a letter to the judge slamming their own adopted son Matt.

Support: Wife Dottie Sandusky also wrote a letter accusing the couple's adopted son Matt - who said he too had been abused - of being a thief and a liar

In an extraordinary display of denial, the Sanduskys said they were victims of a mass conspiracy in letters to the judge at the Centre County courts in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, revealed today.

Sandusky began working for Penn State's football program under the late and legendary coach Joe Paterno in 1969.

Sandusky is credited with creating, during the 1980s and '90s, the fearsome defensive squads that earned the school its reputation as Linebacker U.

But his reputation crumbled when the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office released a grand jury report in November 2011 that resulted in criminal charges against him for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years.

Sandusky was convicted in June on 45 counts of sex abuse, and sentenced on Tuesday to spend, in all likelihood, the rest of his life behind bars.

As the scandal unfolded in November 2011, Paterno and university president Graham Spanier were fired. Paterno, 85, died in January of lung cancer.

Penn State pension payments to Paterno's widow, Sue, are calculated to top $13million.

Jerry Sandusky to Judge John Cleland, September 27I spent many hours reliving this ordeal. I looked at me, my vulnerability, my naivety (some say stupidity), and my trust in people.There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, 'the system', Penn State, and the accusers). It was well done. They won!What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated? All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed. I have been blamed for all of their failures and shortcomings... Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this.A common reaction for those with low self-esteem is to blame others.Instead of walls, I saw great memories: I saw all the people who thrived with a little of our help and hope, I saw a locker room with people hugging and crying as national champs, I saw me throwing thousands of kids up in the air and them asking for more.Dorothy Sandusky to Judge Cleland, July 9People need to know what kind of person [Matt] is. We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) with Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine. He has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him.I use [sic] to believe in our protective system, but now have no faith in the police or legal system. To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths.Many times [Jerry] would give up his free time to make a sporting event of one of the kids he was trying to help. sometimes we would drive for two hours to spend time with these kids.

State government can't take that money back, but did announce that they will no longer pay him the annual $59,000 he used to receive
