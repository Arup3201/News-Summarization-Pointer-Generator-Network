Freddie Starr suffered heart palpitations sparked by the stress of being 'wrongly' accused of trying to grope a 14-year-old girl at a Jimmy Savile sex party, his fiancée revealed.

The 69-year-old madcap comic strenuously denied even meeting his accuser Karin Ward despite a video emerging of the pair of them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’.

Today, speaking live via telephone on ITV's This Morning, Starr's fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, told reporters he had suffered heart problems since the allegations emerged.

Starr's fiance Miss Lea said the couple (their home is pictured) were devastated by the allegations which Freddie has always denied. She said he was in bed and would not be going out for the rest of the week

The comedian also spoke out today, saying he would never have touched an under-age girl.

Starr - who suffered a massive heart attack in April 2010 which left him needing quadruple heart bypass surgery - last week failed to ban ITV from airing Miss Ward’s allegations.

Speaking outside the couple’s £1m mansion in Studley, Warkwickshire, Miss Lea, who
became pregnant with his fifth child last November,  said: 'We are devastated by the allegations which Freddie has always denied.

'He has never molested a woman and nor would he ever do so. Freddie has suffered heart palpitations, he is in bed and will not be going out for the rest of the week.

'The allegations made by this woman have not been investigated by the police but we would welcome a police investigation so he can clear his name.

'Freddie asked his agent if he had ever appeared on Clunk Click with Jimmy Savile and he said no, how is he supposed to remember something that happened 40 years ago?

'I understand the woman [Karin Ward] has a book coming out soon. We are going to hire private investigators to clear Freddie’s name.'

Allegations: The 69-year-old funnyman was first named by Karin Ward (pictured) when she spoke to the BBC's Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast

Starr was named by Miss Ward first by BBC’s Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was shelved.

Last week she told ITV News: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him.'

The 1974 footage showing Starr and Miss Ward was unearthed by Channel 4 News.

It showed Starr appearing on Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was 
being filmed the day she was abused.

Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair.

Speaking today, the comedian said he would welcome the opportunity to speak to police about 'devastating' claims he was involved in groping a teenager.

In an interview with ITV News, the 69-year-old comic said he has people around him who were helping him 'get to the bottom' of the claims.

Starr denied the allegation and said he would never have touched an under-age girl.

Asked by ITV News today whether he had ever fondled an under-age girl, he said: 'Never. I never have done. I never will do. It’s not my style. It’s not in me to do that.

'If there’s one thing I hate, close to my heart, is paedophiles. I cannot stand them. To be accused like this is devastating. I’ve got to fight back.

'I’m the only one in the ring at the moment and I’ve got people now helping me which I feel better for. And they will get to the bottom of it.

'We will get to the bottom of it. I will take this evidence down to the police station and show them. I want a police investigation. I want a police investigation. I want them to interview me.'

Starr said he did not recall ever meeting Ms Ward, and even viewing the footage did not jog any memories.

'Look, I’m in a studio full of people and walked past her. You’re asking me 40 years ago, do I remember? I get asked silly questions like this from the audience - "I met you 35 years ago, do you remember?".'

He went on: 'I do not like being tarred with the same brush as Jimmy Savile if he has been doing this.'

Asked how he felt about the claims, he said: 'It’s making me feel ill. I am mortified. Absolutely mortified by it.'

Starr’s lawyers issued a 
statement strenuously denying the 
‘awful allegation’ of abuse.

A spokesman for Starr said:
‘Freddie is now 69 and cannot be expected to recollect every show that 
he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has met.

'It would
now appear from seeing footage of a Clunk Click show aired in 1974 that
in fact Freddie was mistaken and therefore that he had in fact been on a
Jimmy Savile show.

‘However this does not detract away 
from the fact that Freddie vigorously denies the awful allegation that 
has been made by Karin Ward, which despite this footage is still totally
unsupported and uncorroborated by any other evidence.’

Miss Ward – who also claimed to have 
seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in 
Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the 
now-defunct Duncroft School for girls.

Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded.

Yesterday, Biddy Baxter, the former editor of Blue Peter told Radio 5 Live how she was a victim of sexual harassment at the BBC.

Miss Baxter, 79, who held the position
between 1965 and 1988, said she endured ‘several slightly hairy 
encounters’ with overly-friendly male producers during her early career.

She added: ‘There’s been such a change
of culture since then. Now, that sort of incident is taken notice of 
whether that’s a good thing or not.’

A campaign was launched yesterday to 
posthumously strip Sir Jimmy Savile of his knighthood. Victims of child 
abuse are to lobby MPs for the honour to be removed.
