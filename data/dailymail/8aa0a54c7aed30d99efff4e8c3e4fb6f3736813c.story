Andy Murray always enjoys having a relatively low profile at the start of the French Open, but Friday’s draw did at least offer the hope that he can make a run into the business end of the tournament.

While Rafael Nadal was looking at a repeat of last year’s final with a match in the last eight against compatriot David Ferrer, the 27-year-old Scot would not look any further than his first round against world No 55 Andrey Golubev.

In theory he could meet Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals and then Nadal in the semis, with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic together on the other side of the draw.

Ready for action: Andy Murray faces world No.55 Andrey Golubev in the first round

It was not, overall, the unkindest hand the Wimbledon champion could have been dealt.     

Golubev is one of several Russians who have defected to Kazakhstan, enticed by the prospect of greater earnings there.

An impressive shotmaker with a career high ranking of 33, he made a slow start to the year but has gradually picked up since.         

His highs in 2014 were beating Wawrinka in the Davis Cup in February, although the Swiss may have had a hangover from winning the Australian Open.

Golubev showed how dangerous he was by beating Fernando Verdasco in the first round of the Italian Open although he had to retire in the next round.

In great form: Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in the final of the Rome Masters last weekend

Round one: Andrey Golubev

Round two: Marinko Matosevic

Round three: Philipp Kohlschreiber

Fourth round: Richard Gasquet

Quarter-finals: Stanislas Wawrinka

Semi-finals: Rafael Nadal

Final: Novak Djokovic

A gentler second round against Australian Marinko Matosevic might await, with the scheduled seeds Murray would meet first being the very steady German Philipp Kohlschreiber followed by Richard Gasquet, who he has beaten at Roland Garros before.         

But really, beyond the first round it is all theoreticals in the men’s event.

Among the women Serena Williams finds herself drawn in the same half as Maria Sharapova, but with a first round against Alize Lim of France.         

Caroline Wozniacki took her place in the draw, despite having recent knee injury problems and feeling the pain of her split from Rory McIlroy.         

Four British players started the day still alive in qualifying but Lincoln’s Dan Cox fell in the second round, beaten 6-3 7-6 by top qualifying seed Paolo Lorenzi of Italy.
