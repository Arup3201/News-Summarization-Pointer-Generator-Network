Three men died in last week’s shootings because they chose to shield their girlfriends from the barrage of bullets.

But today, Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto sparked outrage in tweeting a controversial thought on the deaths of Jon Blunk, Matt McQuinn, and Alex Teves, who all were killed protecting their dates.

He wrote: ‘I hope the girls whose boyfriends died to save them were worthy of the sacrifice.’

Indignant: Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto sparked outrage with this tweet

Follow-up: Mr Taranto then followed up with this tweet

The comment, which was in response to a New York Post article telling of the men’s bravery, sparked indignation in the Twitterverse.

Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto is noted for his Best Of The Web column

One user wrote: ‘This could be the most detestable thing I’ve seen tweeted since the Aurora Shooting. Congrats, @jamestaranto, I guess.’

Another blasted Mr Taranto, saying: ‘You, sir, are disgusting. How dare you!!!'

Mr Taranto, who writes the popular online column Best of the Web Today, did not immediately take back his statement.

Rather, he engaged other Twitter users in a heated debate. He retweeted a comment by user Dean Clark, which read: ‘No one is “worthy” of the ultimate sacrifice. The comment struck me as flippant at best. You can do better.’

Mr Taranto wrote that it was ‘one of the few thoughtful answers to a challenging tweet.’

He later tweeted that he was declining interviews, instead linking to a Wall Street Journal column entitled Heroes Of Aurora: A Mea Culpa For An Errant Tweet.

In
it, the columnist called his ‘musings’ an ‘ill-considered tweet,’ 
adding: ‘We intended this to be thought-provoking, but to judge by the 
response, very few people received it that way. The vast majority found 
it offensive and insulting.’

He went on to say that the men’s sacrifices can never be repaid in kind by their girlfriends ‘because life is for the living and cannot be returned to the dead. The closest they can come to redeeming it is to use the gift of their survival well—to live good, full happy lives.’

The stories of the three young men’s bravery, including Mr Blunk, have inspired the country. Mr Blunk, 26, as well as 27-year-old Matt McQuinn and 24-year-old Alex Teves died shielding their significant others from the melee. 

When the shooter entered the theatre in Aurora, Colorado, Mr Bunk threw Ms Young under the theatre seat. 

Giving chilling details of the attack, Ms Young spoke to Today with the tragic cinema in view behind her. 'There was kind of a break in between each gunshot,' she said. 'Every gunshot, I was like, "This is it... I'm done for."'

All throughout this she felt Mr Blunk pushing her down onto the ground and then something happened.

Solemn visit: Actor Christian Bale and his wife Sandra Blazic yesterday visited the memorial across the street from the Century 16 movie theatre

'Jon gave me one good push against that concrete again and then… I didn’t really feel his arms against my back anymore but I knew he was still there.’

Unaware of the gravity of what had happened, when the gunfire abated, Ms Young went to leave.

'I guess I didn’t really know he had passed, up until I started shaking him and saying, "Jon, Jon we have to go … it's time for us to get out of here,"' she said, her voice breaking into tears.

In addition to Jon Blunk, another victim, Matt McQuinn, threw himself in front of his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, and her brother, Nick, to save them both from a hail of bullets fired by shooter James Holmes. 

The selfless act made Mr McQuinn one of the 12 victims of Holmes's maniacal shooting spree when the 24-year-old former PhD student entered through a fire escape in the Century 16 theatre and began firing indiscriminately into the audience.
