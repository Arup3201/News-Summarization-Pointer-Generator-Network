Readjusting to the American workforce after active military service - particularly when dealing with injuries - can be notoriously challenging, which is why two enterprising philanthropists have put their heads together to form an unlikely solution.

Dog Tag Bakery - which trains and employs wounded veterans, not just in baking but in actually running the business - was launched last year in Georgetown, Washington D.C., by Father Richard Curry, a professor of Catholic Studies at Georgetown University, and entrepreneur Connie Milstein.

It's a two-floor operation; upstairs a study center where ex-members of the U.S. ex-military (and their spouses or caregivers) are taught classes in business, finance and marketing, and downstairs a storefront bakery, where these skills are put into practice running the operation for local customers.

'We provide the education and the opportunities to understand what it takes to run a small business with an entrepreneurial mindset,' the program's chief operating officer Meghan Ogilvie told ABC News.

'[So they can] step out into the next phase of their life empowered with these tools.'

Community hit: More than 50per cent of the bakery's business comes from daily regulars, who enjoy the sweet treats and are keen to support the initiative  

Dog Tag Bakery's general manager, veteran Justin Ford, says they are swamped with 'a ton of regulars'.

'More than 50per cent of our business is regulars who come in almost on a daily basis,' he explains.

'I think the community loves our mission, and our product more importantly, and they’re coming back for more.'

Speaking to CBS News, co-founder Father Curry, who trained as a baker himself in his youth, remarked: 'The world thinks that disabled veterans can't be hired.

'And that's absolutely absurd. We're here to prove them wrong.'

Veterans who have completed the program include retired Army Ranger Sergeant Major Sedrick Banks, who sustained brain and spiral injuries in a mortar attack in Iraq.

'Dog Tag was my first major step back into the working mindset,' he said. 'Before the program, I didn't have confidence. I didn't feel like I had the ability. Now I'm confident in myself, you know?'

The bakery is currently accepting applications for its second class to begin in June.
