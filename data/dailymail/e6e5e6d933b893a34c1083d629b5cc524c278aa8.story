A zoo employee has taken on the role of surrogate dad to an orphaned wallaby joey after its mother was struck down by a car while she was still in the pouch.

Matt Dea from Sydney's Taronga Zoo has been hand-raising the female joey for the past two weeks by carrying a makeshift pouch and waking up at 2am for one of five daily bottle feeds.

'Caring for such a young joey is very involved and she hasn't left my side,' Mr Dea said.

The female joey was brought to Taronga Wildlife Hospital last month after her mother was killed by a car at Oxford Falls, north of Sydney

'She comes home with me, she comes to the shops and she sleeps beside my desk at work each day.'

The joey, who was named Alikira meaning sunshine, was brought to Taronga Wildlife Hospital last month after her mother was killed by a car at Oxford Falls, north of Sydney.

A zookeeper spotted the wallaby beside the road on her way to work and found the joey still alive inside the pouch.

'She was a bit stunned but otherwise healthy with no injuries from the car accident. We were really lucky,' Mr Dea said. 

The six-month-old's diet is restricted to a special milk mixture and the occasional nibble of grass.

She'll gradually be introduced to solid foods like carrot and sweet potato in the coming months.

The joey will also be able to start stepping out of her replacement pouch in four to six weeks time.

“She’ll be a little wobbly on her feet at first, but she’ll soon be hopping in and out as she becomes more adventurous,”Mr Dea said.  

He said Alkira’s story should serve as a reminder for motorists to watch out for wildlife on the roads these school holidays.

Taronga Wildlife Hospital cares for and treats more than 1,000 injured or orphaned native animals every year, including wallabies, possums, echidnas, birds, sea turtles and Little Penguins.
