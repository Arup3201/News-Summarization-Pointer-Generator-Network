Al Roker has allegedly been disciplined and told to 'tone it down' following a series of inappropriate comments just days after earning a spot in the Guinness Book Of World Records for the longest ever weather report.

The 60-year-old Today Show newscaster was ordered to 'think before he speaks' after telling a woman her husband looked like her dad during an interview, Page Six reported.

Senior management also cited the moment he told a woman her crying child looked like a 'Japanese anime' character, the report claimed.

Tone it down: Executives have allegedly told Al Roker his embarrassing comments are not acceptable

'Idiosyncratic': He was live on air in 2012 when he said NBC has a tendency to throw people under buses

And he was reminded of the time in 2012 he said on air that NBC has a tendency to 'throw you under a bus' shortly after director Matt Lauer fired anchor Ann Curry.

Blasting the comments as 'idiosyncratic', bosses allegedly told Roker to 'act more like a traditional weatherman'.

Unlike the show's executive Jamie Horowitz, who was fired this week after just three months with NBC's Today show, Roker is said to be cooperating with senior management.

Sources claimed Horowitz and Lauer did not get along.

The disputes come amid a moment of triumph for Roker, who broke the record for the longest weathercast ever, after 34 straight hours of non-stop weather updates.

Starting on Wednesday evening, he officially accomplished the feat early Friday during his daily appearance on Today.

Long shift: The Today anchor's meteorology marathon lasted 34 straight hours 

Getting some rest: As part of the rules, Roker was allowed a five minute break every hour

Roker was so dedicated to the task at hand, dubbed Rokerthon, that he at one point forgot to turn off his microphone while he went to the bathroom.

He immediately acknowledged the incident, joking, 'We gave new meaning to live stream.'

The weatherman had visits from celebs including Alan Alda, Candace Bergen, Aaron Sorkin and Nick Lachey during his marathon of meteorology, and kept fans updated on social media with an hourly photo, looking slightly more maniacal with each passing hour.

His Today co-anchor Willie Geist noted as much, saying, 'He's got crazy eyes.'

He also had the company of a revolving door of college students, who sat off camera and were hired as the required witnesses for the attempt, and Norwegian weathercaster Eli Kari Gjengedal, the previous record holder.

No doubt helping Roker out was the severe weather happening across the country this week, with temperatures plummeting and a massive snowstorm blanketing the Pacific Northwest. 

Roker even admitted as much, saying, 'I don't know when I've had this much weather to talk about all over the country. It makes it easy.'

He was allowed a five minute break every hour, and sipped on green tea and a ginger drink for energy.

Party time: The very special event also managed to raise over $70,000 for United States Service Organizations

Great gift: The Today team also rolled out a bed so Roker could get some rest

Geist, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales and Tamron Hall where on hand to honor a remarkably hoarse Roker when  he finally broke the record, and even rolled out a bed so he could get some rest.

Matt Lauer was not on the show today, but did call in to offer his congratulations.

In addition to bringing Roker some weather glory, and possibly grabbing some viewers from morning show ratings champ Good Morning America, this very special event also managed to raise over $70,000 for United States Service Organizations.
