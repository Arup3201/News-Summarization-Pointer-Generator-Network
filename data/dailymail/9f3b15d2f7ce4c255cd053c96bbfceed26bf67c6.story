Caroline Wozniacki take note. Rory McIlroy is looking down on the rest of the field from a great height after consigning black Fridays to the ether in the most spectacular manner imaginable — at The Open Championship.

The Dane had wielded her stiletto by informing the world via social media that she could finally wear her heels for the first time in three years.

Trust her former fiance Rory to respond by showing a clean pair to everyone at Royal Liverpool and banishing all talk about what the heck happens to him on Fridays. Size doesn’t matter in golf, and certainly not when you play like the Northern Irishman.

Feathered friend: McIlroy negotiated the awkward task of dealing with a green-invading pheasant to set himself up with a lead after his round on Friday

The 25-year-old followed his first-round 66 with another one to open a four-shot halfway lead over American Dustin Johnson.

Here was a vivid demonstration of all the cruel beauty links golf possesses. Pity all the ball strikers who had the worst of the weather on Thursday afternoon and again on Friday morning. Those in that half of the draw, such as defending champion Phil Mickelson, world  No 1 Adam Scott and leading home hope Justin Rose, must have played a golf course that was three or four shots harder over the first 36 holes.

As if Rory doesn’t have enough going for him, they must have thought. How helpless they must have felt as McIlroy went on one of his usual Thursday rampages on Friday.

This morning, something like a meteorological armageddon is due to visit these parts, with six hours of heavy rain predicted. So Rory may well  have soft greens to play with when he goes out in the third round. Has fate already decreed the destination of the Claret Jug?

Mind you, it’s one thing for Mother Nature to offer a helping hand; quite another to take full advantage. There were plenty of form players in McIlroy’s half of the draw who didn’t capitalise, including the highly fancied Henrik Stenson and Graeme McDowell. And then there’s Tiger Woods.

Struggling
 for form: Tiger Woods shot a five-over-par round of 77 to leave him 
just inside the cut-mark at The Open Championship in Hoylake

Getting
 out of the long stuff: Woods watches his shot from the rough on the 
tenth hole at Royal Liverpool Golf Course in Hoylake during his second 
round

The American ripped up his blueprint for Hoylake but it backfired spectacularly. In five rounds at Hoylake he had used a driver on only two occasions. Here he used it on both the first and second holes and the result was he double bogeyed the former and bogeyed the latter. He could probably have taken a seven iron off both tees and done better than that.

Thereafter the driver remained sheathed for a while and a more customary service was resumed. Par followed par but that start had hurt him deeply. The first hole on this course for the members is the third in The Open. How Woods (right) must have wished it was the first for him as well.

By the time he got to the 17th, he was still after his first birdie of the day. Forced to gamble, out came the driver. Cue more calamity. Another horrific slice and his ball disappeared out of bounds. Reload time and this one was a duck hook. The resultant triple bogey seven meant he needed to birdie the last to make the cut. Sensibly he left the driver in the bag. He was six over par on the four holes where he’d used it.

By the side of the par five 18th green in two, he holed a tricky seven-footer to avoid the ignominy of consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional.

By the side of the par five 18th green 
in two, he holed a tricky seven-footer to avoid the ignominy of 
consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional.

Clearly, those in the unlucky half of the draw have plenty of catching up to do. Scott is nine behind, while it was rough luck on Rose and Mickelson. Both shot rounds of 70 which were highly commendable in the morning but were rendered average in the afternoon as they trail by 10 and 12 shots respectively.

It’s not just McIlroy they have to catch either, but a stack of good players as well from the draw’s most favourable half.

Four shots behind are two Europeans in Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Italian Frankie Molinari and two Americans in Ryan Moore and Rickie Fowler.

The wind was still blowing significantly when McIlroy’s approach to the opening hole failed to hold the green and he didn’t get up and down for a par. All those ugly stats were whirling in the brain: 59 under par for first rounds; seven over for second. McIlroy responded with three pars before taking up the birdie on offer at the long fifth. Now the wind was dropping and the glint in McIlroy’s eye could be seen a mile off. He knew he had been presented with a massive opportunity. How he seized it.

Easy does it: A successful shot from the rough on the 12th hole meant that McIlroy was able to maintain his lead at the top of the leaderboard

Versatile: It was a great day for McIlroy as he set up a lead that any of the opposition from the field will struggle to claw him back in from

A pheasant running across the eighth 
green seemed appropriate as McIlroy made three birdies in four holes 
around the turn. The man who won the 2011 US Open by eight shots and the
 2012 US PGA Championship by seven was pulling away once more, and 
history has moved into view again. Only two players have won three 
majors at an earlier age and they just happen to go by the Christian 
names of Tiger and Jack.

On
 his 28th birthday, George Coetzee did his best to conjure up some 
support over the weekend by revealing he is a lifelong Liverpool fan. It
 would be wrong to underestimate him, too. Think what another South 
African of similar age and similar status at the time did at St Andrews 
in 2010, when Louis Oosthuizen pulled away from the field. Coetzee 
showed his liking for links golf when he opened with a pair of 69s at 
The Open at Royal St George’s in 2011 — his first-ever major.

These
 36 holes were more impressive however. To emerge from his half of the 
draw with a five under par total was a great effort. The next best from 
his half was Scott on three under.

Finally,
 no one would begrudge Tom Watson being in the kinder half of the draw. 
At 64 years of age he followed up his opening 71 with a 73 to make the 
cut.

The greatest links golfer of all time has still got it.
