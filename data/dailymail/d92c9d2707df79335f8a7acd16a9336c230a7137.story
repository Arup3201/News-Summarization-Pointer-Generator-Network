A young boy whose parents were told he may never walk or talk after brain surgery has defied the odds to become a dance champion and actor.

Ben Wilby underwent a nine-hour operation because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth.

The youngster was diagnosed with Craniosynostosis when he was two years old, and doctors warned his parents he may not survive the procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.

But a decade later and the now 12-year-old has recovered to star in films alongside Martin Freeman, and has also won an international dance competition.

Ben Wilby, 12, has defied the odds, to recover after doctors warned his parents their son was unlikely to walk or talk following an operation to relieve pressure on his brain when he was two years old

Craniosynostosis is a condition where one or more of the sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses and turns into bone.

Following birth, a baby's brain grows incredibly rapidly - doubling in size in nine months and tripling in size by 36 months.

To accommodate the growth, the skull also expands and t can do this because is it’s made up of several bones that are held together by 'sutures' - like fibrous hinges.

Craniosynostosis is when the sutures close or fuse too soon.

This can result in an abnormal head shape or facial features if the brain manages to find space to grow.

It can also result in increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to blindness, sleeping and eating impairments, as well as problems with mental development. The condition occurs in one in 2,000 births.

The young actor from Cannock in Staffordshire, underwent the complex operation at Birmingham Children’s Hospital when he was two years old.

To mark the anniversary of the procedure, Ben will meet the surgeon who saved his life as well as visiting patients and their parents at the hospital to show them it is possible to achieve anything.

His parents were told their son may not be able to walk after brain surgery, but Ben defied the odds and joined a dance school to develop his balance and improve the strength in his legs.

He went on to win a number of trophies, including the title of European Freestyle Champion.

Determined to live life in the limelight,
 Ben then beat 500 other young hopefuls to win the role of Bob in the 
hit film, Nativity, having turned up to the auditions wearing an 
audacious outfit of neon green shorts, legwarmers and a t-shirt 
with the slogan 'Born To Dance' on it.

In the film, the boy can be seen showing of his moves, including a bit of break dancing.

His mother Jill Wilby, said: ‘It has been an incredible ten years since Ben’s lifesaving operation. Doctors warned us that if Ben survived the operation he might never walk or even talk.

‘It seems just like yesterday to me. I remember Ben going into surgery clutching his favourite car. It was the most horrendous nine hours of my life. What he has achieved in these ten years after his operation is just unbelievable.’

Ben, who goes to the Sylvia Young Theatre School, starred in Nativity alongside Martin Freeman and Nativity 2 with David Tennant. He will appear alongside Martin Clunes in Nativity 3, which will be shown in cinemas in December.

Mrs Wilby said: ‘Ben is a miracle and to think how far he has come in those ten years is just remarkable.

‘In July Ben is set to go and meet Stephen Dover, the surgeon who carried out the operation on Ben all those years ago. He wants to thank him and tell him what he has achieved since his surgery.

‘While we are there Ben is going to meet patients on Ward 10 where Ben was a patient and speak to parents. Ben wants to show them that there is hope no matter what the situation is and that miracles do happen.’
