Petrol prices in 2012 are 'broadly equivalent' to those during the Suez crisis, House of Commons researchers said

Petrol prices are now as high as in the wake of the Suez crisis when petrol was rationed, shocking new research suggests.

In the last 100 years, the cost of filling up a car has only been higher in the wake of the First World War when the petrol pump was still a novelty on the high street.

New research by the House of Commons library lays bare how prices at the pumps have soared.

Drivers in 2012 now pay as much in real terms as 1957, when the country was gripped by severe shortages after Egypt nationalised the key trading route of the Suez Canal.

Using 2011 prices as a baseline, research shows drivers are paying 124.8p a litre in 2012, the highest level since 1957, when petrol cost the equivalent of 132.7p.

But House of Commons researchers say the figures are within the margin of error - and  prices today can be ‘seen as broadly equivalent to those during the Suez crisis when petrol was rationed and duty was increased by 40 per cent’.

It means fuel costs today are higher in real terms than the sharp spikes seen after the oil shock in 1973, when Arab oil producers imposed an embargo on fuel exports.

Petrol is also more expensive in real terms than during the World War Two rationing and the 101.2p cost which triggered fuel protests in 2000.

The only time petrol has been higher was when records began in 1920, when motoring was the preserve of the wealthy and petrol cost 159.6p in 2011 prices.

Punished at the pumps: Research published by the House of Commons library shows how, in 2011 prices, petrol now costs as much per litre as in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1957

Historic high: Petrol prices in Britain are as high now as when British forces were deployed to the Libyan desert to prepare to invade Egypt, after the Suez Canal, a key trade route for fuel, was nationalised

The Suez Canal was a crucial trade route for British ships to reach the rest of the Empire.

By 1955, petrol accounted for half of the canal's traffic.

In 1936 an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty gave Egypt independence, but British troops would still be based on the canal to protect the strategic interest.

In 1951, nationalist leader Nahas Pasha revoked the treaty, and the British garrison soon came under attack.

In 1956, President Nasser announced he was to nationalist the Anglo-French Suez Canal Company to raise funds to build a dam.

British PM Anthony Eden considered military action to restore Britain's control of the region, but the US balked at the idea.

With fuel supplies unable to get through the canal, petrol was rationed from December 1956 to May 1957 and there was a 40 per cent increase in duty.

A Commons briefing note said: ‘This 
was the first ex-pump price [the price at which the public buy fuel] and it is highly likely that then, as now, 
new technology initially comes at a higher price.

‘After
this initial spike, their wider adoption and the greater economies of 
large storage tanks will have helped to reduce prices.’

The
lowest real pump prices in recent times were in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s when the Treasury cut duty for unleaded and oil prices were 
low.

Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has campaigned for fairer fuel prices, said: 'Britain is being taken for a very expensive ride.

'Clear evidence has been published by the campaign that I set up - www.PetrolPromise.com - that oil companies and financial speculators are pushing up fuel prices at the pump.

'In my view, Britain should move towards what other forward-looking G8 economies - such as America, Germany, and Austria - have done to crack down on oil cartels. Families are facing an expensive energy-crunch, and we need action to bring prices down.'

In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne scrapped a planned 3p rise in fuel duty due in January, declaring: ‘That is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country. And it will help businesses too.

‘It means that under this Government we’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years. In fact they have been cut.’

But the government is under pressure to do more to ease the pressure on motorists.

Low and middle income families spend almost 5 per cent of total disposable income on petrol and diesel.

The AA motoring organisation found the average cost of filing up a family car with petrol is £1.50 higher than a year ago, and £1.75 higher for diesel.

Tory MP Robert Halfon called for a crackdown on 'oil cartels'

Luke Bosdet, spokesman for the AA, said: 'In 1957 we were talking about the Suez Cris.

'In 2012 we are talking about the UK family crisis. One was miles away and the other is happening on the streets of Britain.'

Ministers are now investigating the impact of the closure of hundreds of petrol stations on prices, with drivers in rural areas forced to travel further to fill up their tanks.

In April 2010 there were 8,884 petrol stations open in the UK, but by August 2012 it had fallen by 285 to 8,599.

Energy minister John Hayes will publish a report on the retail fuel market in the New Year, which will examine the ‘implications of reductions in the number of petrol filling stations on the security of supply and resilience of the downstream oil sector’.

Nick Clegg this month admitted the soaring cost of living was the key concern of voters which the government had to address.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'They care about how they’re going to pay their bills, the price of petrol, the prices of gas and electricity, the price of food, whether their kids are going to get a job, whether their kids are going to get their foot on the first rung of the property ladder.

‘And those are the things against which we’ll be rightly tested in 2015.’
