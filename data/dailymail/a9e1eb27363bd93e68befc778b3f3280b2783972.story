Two teenagers, 15, have been arrested after breaking into an empty middle school in Denver.

Police say the two juveniles were carrying what appeared to be long rifles when they entered Noel Middle School at about 10pm last night.

They were arrested about five hours later after standoff.

Earlier police had surrounded the building and a bomb squad was called to the scene over concerns the men had explosives and were laying devices.

Officers saw the pair wearing backpacks 
and holding a large yellow pipe, according to reports.

Two cleaners called police shortly after 10pm local time after seeing two men inside the building.

Police sent a telephone notification to neighborhood residents warning them to stay indoors.

Denver Police said classrooms in the school were ransacked and it is believed the motive behind the break-in is burglary.

The force said they recovered the weapons but they are now thought to be BB guns, rather than rifles.

Robert White, Denver's Chief of Police, said it is thought the two teens had earlier tried to break into another school.

Officers had been called to Greenwood Elementary School at about 9pm local time where a window had been smashed. Â

Chief White said they were called to Noel Middle School an hour later and officers then watched the two men on the school's security cameras.

He said: 'It appears one individual had made entry into the school and was waving the other individual inside the school.

'These two individuals were determined to be juveniles.'

He said the two were arrested after 'several hours attempting to talk the individuals out of the school'.

Police tried to use the school's public address system to try to communicate with them.
