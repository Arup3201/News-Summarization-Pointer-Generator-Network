A married pastor who ran off with the wife of a local school governor has left his post.

Father-of-three Stuart Cathrow has reportedly moved in with Laura Etherington, whose husband is a parent governor of Canary Wharf College.

Now parents claim the couple’s actions are damaging the reputation of the leading free school – which is in East London and has been rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted.

‘It is all out in the open but the school is trying to keep it hush hush and some parents have been told not to say anything,’ said one parent.

‘Many believe it is bringing the school into disrepute.’

It is thought the pair met through their work for the Christian primary.

As well as being pastor for a local evangelical church, Mr Cathrow, 43, was chairman of the school’s parents’ association and mother-of-two Mrs Etherington, 34, acted as treasurer. 

Mr Cathrow’s wife Louise, 46, is leader of learning programmes at the school and is living with their children in the Isle of Dogs.

It is not known where banker James Etherington, 35, is living, but he is thought to have left the £1million flat in Limehouse he shared with his wife, son and daughter.

‘Laura admitted the affair to the parents’ association during the summer holidays and told them that she and Stuart were together,’ the anonymous parent added. 

‘It is not known how long they had been having an affair, but they met while on the association and also ran the London Marathon together last year. They are now living together and go to church together.’

Last night, Mr Cathrow and Mrs Etherington declined to comment on the situation.

Quaystone Church could not be reached for comment, however Mr Cathrow last posted a sermon on its website in May and is no longer listed as pastor.

He is also said to have stepped down as chairman of the parents’ association, and Mrs Etherington is no longer treasurer.

Principal of Canary Wharf College, Sarah Counter, said: ‘Neither the Reverend Stuart Cathrow or Laura Etherington are, or indeed have ever been, contracted employees of the school.

‘This matter is of a personal nature between the adults involved and we respect their right to privacy in the matter.’
