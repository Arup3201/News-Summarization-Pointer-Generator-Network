Kira Trevino, 30, was last seen by her husband, Jeff Trevino, at the couple's St Paul house on Friday and Trevino's family said that her cell phone and purse were discovered in the white 2010 Chevy Cobalt

Upon conducting that search on Monday evening, investigators said they found evidence at the house that a crime had been committed.

Despite the arrest of Jeffrey Trevino, police still consider Kira Trevino a missing person.

Her family, who have made relentless media appearances as they try to raise awareness of missing Kira, were notified of the arrest this evening.

'I actually just saw him, Jeff, Wednesday evening at my house in Wausau,' said Kira's mother Marcie Steger to CBS Local.

'As far as we know, he was the last person to see her.'

The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension searched the home on Monday evening as family and friends made desperate pleas for Kira, who is a manager at Delia’s, a clothing store for teenage girls in the world-famous mall to return home.

Mall security noticed her car in a parking ramp on the west side of the mall at about 4:55 a.m. Monday and called police.

Tara Hall, a colleague who said she is Trevino's best friend, told the Star Tribune that it's perfectly normal for Kira to park where the car was found, but not specifically in the isolated location under a ramp where police found the vehicle.

However, family members told Fox 9 News that it was neatly parked in a place that she never usually stopped in and struck them as odd, because Kira was not skilled at parking.

Authorities canvassed the car and said there was 'evidence that concerned investigators,' but they wouldn’t elaborate further on what that meant. 

Security personel are reviewing surveillance footage for any clues that could shed light on Trevino's disappearance.

'This is absolutely 100 percent out of character for her,' said her friend Jackie Arrando.

'She would never, ever just not show up for work or go somewhere without letting people know. Never.'

'We've been friends for a long time, everyone is really worried.'

Family members have flown in from around Wisconsin and Texas and spent yesterday with investigators.

'Kira, if you're watching this, I hope you're safe and I hope you come home. We're just very worried and concerned and we're going to do everything we can to find you,' Kira's Sister Keri Anne Steger told KARE 11.

Kira was first reported missing on Saturday after she failed to turn up for work on Saturday - leaving her husband as the last person to see her.

'We are looking to see if any suspicious activity is related to this disappearance, as we do with any missing persons case,' said St. Paul Police Sgt. Paul Paulos.

'She is an adult, but she has been reported missing, and this is an active case. We recognize that this is important to her family and to her friends, and it’s important to us as well.'

Trevino’s husband, Jeff Trevino, confirmed that police found the car but would not take questions about the case, saying he didn’t want to hinder the investigation.
