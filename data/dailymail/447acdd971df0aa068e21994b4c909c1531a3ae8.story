A 21-strong crew on board a 100ft yacht are recovering today following a dramatic rescue off the Irish coast during one of the world's most dangerous sailing competitions.

The US-registered boat, Rambler 100, was taking part in the Fastnet Race when it overturned about 16 miles from Baltimore, County Cork.

One woman was airlifted to hospital 
after spending several hours in the water and is believed to have been 
suffering from hypothermia.

The event has a fearsome reputation after the 1979 race was devastated by strong winds and seas, resulting in 15 deaths.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) said 16 crew members were sitting on the hull of the vessel and five were missing when a lifeboat from Baltimore arrived at the scene just after 8pm.

A local dive team picked the remaining survivors out of the water.

Yachting race officials said among the 21 crew members rescued was the former chairman of United Technologies Corporation.

George David and his partner, Wendy Touton, were among five people swept out to sea. The others managed to hang onto the hull.

Race officials say Mr David and Ms Touton were in the water for 2 and a half hours and she was treated for hypothermia.

Mick Harvey, a veteran sailor from Australia who now lives in Newport, Rhode Island, in the U.S. was also was among the crew.

Kieron Cotter, coxswain of the volunteer crew, said: 'We picked the 16 people off the hull and took them on board the lifeboat, with our dinghy going back and forth, and organised for other boats in the area to search for the missing five.

'They were picked up by a local diving boat.'

The five included a man in his 70s, he added.

The crew are believed to have been looked after by locals in Baltimore last night after being brought to shore. A decision is to be made today on whether to try to salvage the capsized yacht.

The
alarm was raised when the yacht's personal locator beacon was activated
as it overturned five miles south west of Fastnet lighthouse.

Cheers: Incredibly, despite five crew missing, all the people were recovered from the freezing water

Mr Cotter, whose crew was on an exercise in the area, said the sea was not rough but visibility was down to one mile as they searched for the stricken yacht and crew.

Dozens of yachts were lost and 15 were killed when huge winds and seas hit them, also in the Irish Sea.

Hundreds more were left stranded surrounded by bodies floating in the sea.

Rescuers from Britain and Ireland worked flat out to find some of the many yachts affected.

A Dutch warship and trawlers from France also joined the rescue operation, which was the biggest ever since the Second World War.

But this was made difficult because they had to search an area of around 20,000 square miles.

Those recovered and their yachts were taken to Ireland, the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall and Devon, as well as Wales.

After the tragedy, vessels had to carry VHF radio and restrictions on electronic navigational aids were also lifted.

'Eventually somebody saw something in the distance and it was them,' he said.

'I've never seen anything like it before in 36 years with the RNLI. It was totally amazing. They told us five other yachts had passed within a mile and hadn't seen them.'

Mr Cotter said the keel of the boat broke shortly after it passed the Fastnet Rock, causing it to overturn within 15 seconds, throwing everyone overboard.

'One man managed to get up on the hull and get the rest up, but the other five drifted away,' he said. 'It was very dramatic.'

The
Irish Coast Guard co-ordinated the major rescue operation, which 
involved Baltimore RNLI, the Shannon and Waterford-based rescue 
helicopters, and Irish Naval vessel the LE Ciara.

One crew member was treated in hospital and 20 were taken back to Baltimore Harbour, where they were assessed by medical staff.

Ian Loffhagen, racing manager of the 
Rolex Fastnet Race, said the yacht - skippered by George David - 
capsized between the Fastnet Rock and the Pantaenius Buoy.

'All 21 crew have been rescued,' he said.

Some
314 yachts - including six Irish boats - are taking part in the Rolex 
Fastnet Race and set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight on Sunday.

The
Royal Ocean Racing Club's biennial event takes the fleet 608 miles 
along the south coast of the UK and across the Celtic Sea to the Fastnet
Rock off south west Ireland, before returning around the Scilly Isles 
to the finish in Plymouth.
