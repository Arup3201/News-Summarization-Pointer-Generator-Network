Philip Morton: Paedophile wrote about how he 'fell for' a 15-year-old girl in an autobiography he called The Loves And Heartaches Of My Life

A paedophile who wrote down details of his abuse of a 15-year-old girl in an autobiography he called The Loves And Heartaches Of My Life has been jailed for five years.

Philip Morton, 56, documented his indecent assaults on the teenager between 1994 and 1995 in the book, which was discovered by police officers searching his house in Lincolnshire.

In it Morton described giving the girl gifts of earrings and a walkie-talkie so they could speak to one another at night, and wrote: 'I found myself falling for her... I spent a lot of time with her'.

Morton also said in his book - which was not a published title but a paper document he kept at his home - that his victim would sleep in his bed.

Humberside Police said officers had obtained intelligence that led them to procure a search warrant for Morton's house in Immingham, near Grimsby, last February.

As well as the harrowing book, officers found more than 17,000 indecent images of children on his computer - around 100 of which fell within the most offensive category.

Prosecutor Mark Kendall told Grimsby Crown Court that police uncovered over a million images on a series of hard drives stored at Morton's house, but that limited resources meant it was impossible to say how many were indecent.

The court heard Morton had used encrypting software to hide some of the images, as well as details of websites he visited and the words he typed into search engines.

When interviewed by police, Morton claimed he had made up parts of the book and that the young girl had told him she was 16 years old. He also told officers he had ended the relationship.

When police traced his now adult victim, she gave details of the indecent assaults and told them she had viewed Morton as 'a father figure'.

'Appalling breach of trust': Morton was jailed for five years at Grimsby Crown Court and placed on the sex offenders register for life

Morton admitted 14 offences of possession of indecent images and two offences of indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl.

Judge Mark Bury told Morton: 'You were in a position of trust. You have breached that trust in an appalling way.'

The judge said of the thousands of indecent images found in Morton's home: 'There was an organisation and sophistication which was amassed over a number of years.'

Richard Butters, defending Morton, said 80 per cent of the images were in the lowest category of indecency. He said the 56-year-old was a 'medical time bomb' after suffering two heart attacks in the past ten years.Morton was sentenced to five years in prison and placed on the sex offenders register for life.

A Humberside Police spokeswoman said of the investigation that led them to Morton's door almost 20 years after his indecent assault of the teenage girl: 'The search warrant was intelligence led, that is to say prompted on the basis of information gathered.'
