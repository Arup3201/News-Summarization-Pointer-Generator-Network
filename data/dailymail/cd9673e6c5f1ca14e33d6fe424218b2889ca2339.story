A model with 'excessively long toes' used stolen credit card details to pay for £5,000 worth of corrective surgery, a court heard.

Denise Whylie, who also works as an actress, had the procedure for her 'mallet toe deformity,' which meant her second and third toes were a lot longer than they should be, jurors were told.

The 38-year-old allegedly gave the Premier Foot and Ankle Centre the fake name Denise Stephens and claimed her father, then her uncle would settle the bill with credit cards over the phone.

It was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards, belonging to two women and one man, were stolen when it was contacted by the bank, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Whylie, of Brentford, Middlesex, was arrested last June.

She denied the offence claiming she had given the cash to a friend who worked at the clinic who could get her a discount price but only if they paid for the procedure themselves.

She was charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud two months later.

Opening the case today, prosecutor John Traversi said: 'This is a strange case of fraud because of the nature of what it was the prosecution say was obtained by fraud.

'It was not goods from a shop or supermarket, it was a service, and the service was a surgical procedure on the defendant’s feet.

'And this case is about how that was paid for, or rather as the prosecution would advance not paid for.

'What happened was a lady calling herself Denise Stephens, who is the defendant Denise Whylie, called the clinic to make an appointment regarding surgery.

'She saw a surgeon who noted she had 
excessively long second and third toes on each foot and surgery was 
booked in for what was described as mallet toe deformity.'

Alleged scam: It was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards, belonging to two women and one man, were stolen when it was contacted by the bank, Blackfriars Crown Court (above) heard

The court heard Whylie was supposed to
pay £120 for the consultation but she told them her father would pay 
later as she had no money at the time, giving his name as Duncan 
Stephens who lived in Yorkshire.

Her
surgery was booked in for May 9 but when the clinic had still not been 
paid upfront the day before the surgery they called Whylie who told them
her uncle would now be paying, it is alleged.

The
court heard a man then called the central London clinic on and tried to
pay using three different credit cards, which were all declined.

But the payment went through on another three cards and Whylie had the surgery at a BMI hospital in London’s Fitzroy Square.

‘Over the telephone, he provided the 
details of three different cards all of which were tried to facilitate 
the necessary payment all of which were declined,’ Mr Traversi 
continued.

‘Then finally 
two cards were accepted, and a £2,000 and a £1,000 payment was made on 
the first, and a £2,000 payment on the second.

‘The payment seemed to go through okay.’

On May 10, she attended the surgery at the BMI Fitzroy Hospital, Fitzroy Square, central London and underwent the £5,000 surgery.

But six days later credit card company HBOS contacted the company to tell them the payment wouldn’t go through because the cards were being investigated for fraud.

When the details of the cards provided by Whylie’s ‘uncle’ were checked, they were traced to the accounts of HBOS customers Paul Fearns and Dulcie Wilson, the court heard.

The scam resulted in a £5,000 loss to the clinic.

She voluntarily attended a police station on June 14 and told officers she was ‘not aware of any problems with payment or knowledge or involvement of fraud of any kind.’

Whylie, who states she is a model, actress and business owner of hair extensions company HairXtensionsXpress online, denies the charges between April 30 and May 11 last year.

The trial continues.
