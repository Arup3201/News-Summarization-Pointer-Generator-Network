Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was less than pleased with the attention as she watched her boyfriend play Roger Federer in another quarterfinal in Melbourne today.

Sitting in the players' box, the court-side camera kept focusing on the 25-year-old tennis WAG instead of the game, and finally Kim lost her temper.

Andy Murray's partner of eight years became so annoyed that she attempted to cover it with a baseball cap, before enlisting the help of a fellow attendee who wrapped it in a towel.

Kim's cover-up did nothing to help her partner on the pitch, as 26-year-old Murray was later knocked out of the Australian Open by Roger Federer.

The 32-year-old Swiss seemed to have reverted to his prime as he closed out the Wimbledon champion 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3.

It was Murray who appeared the older player as he somewhat stiffened up towards the end of their quarter final on a cool Melbourne evening which saw his back get its first real test since surgery in September.

Murray, who underwent back surgery last year, expressed signs of pain during the latter half of the match, grimacing in discomfort.

He later admitted he had not played enough matches since his surgery to be fully match-fit again.

'I was proud of the way I fought,' he told MailOnline 'That’s the highest level I have had to play at in a long time.

'I
 thought I hung in well and I almost got myself back into the match. I 
have come a long way in four months and I did a good job to get myself 
competitive but right now I am very disappointed.

In an earlier quarter final, Spaniard Rafael Nadal was seen receiving medical care for a nasty-looking wound in 
the palm of his racquet hand, thought to have been caused by a callous 
blister.

Despite his injury,
 the 27-year-old, beat Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the match and is 
through to the semi-final where he will meet Federer.

Care: Rafael Nadal receives medical attention during the game in Melbourne after a blister appeared in the palm of his racquet hand

Nadal played with taped up fingers to 
fend off blisters, but ended up with an open wound after a blister burst
 in the palm of his hand during the game.

Although
 the injury sometimes appeared to affect his feel for the ball during an
 undulating quarter final, he won by do 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-2 against the 
22-year-old Bulgarian.

'I 
was very lucky in the tiebreak, on one set point he missed an easy 
forehand, I felt anything could happen. My hand affects the serve, the 
rest of things are more or less fine,’ Nadal told MailOnline.

‘I
 will have to try and improve the hand in the next two days. I can 
practice but the problem is if I don’t protect the hand it will get 
worse.

Injury: Nadal's blister is believed to have been cause by a callus torn off by the movement of the raquet

Frequent tennis 
players and professionals get calluses on their hands, which can become 
mobile if the hardened skin grows an edge.

As
 the callus moves on top of another layer of skin, blisters develop 
underneath. When this happens, the movement of the racquet can tear off 
the callus, which is thought to be the case of Nadal.

The tournament is taking place amid a crippling heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 40C in Melbourne last week.

Players
 have complained of ‘inhumane’ conditions after one hallucinated, 
claiming he could see cartoon character Snoopy mid-match, a ball boy 
fainted, one player vomited, and drink bottles melted on court.

It
 was during a qualifier in the first round that Canadian player Frank 
Dancevic hallucinated then fainted during his match against Frenchman 
Benoit Paire.

He was unconscious for almost a minute but returned to the court before losing the match.
