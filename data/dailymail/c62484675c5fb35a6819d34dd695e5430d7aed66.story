The callous owner of this tiny Rottweiler puppy threw her out with the rubbish after severe spinal damage left her unable to stand.

Vets made the difficult decision to put the stricken three-month-old animal to sleep due to the serious nature of her injuries.

The puppy was found curled up in a cardboard box and dumped next to some bins in Enfield, north London.

Vets were forced to put down this dumped three-month-old Rottweiler puppy after it was unable to stand due to severe spinal damage

A second newborn Rottweiler cross, believed to be from the same litter, was found nearby and showed signs of mistreatment.

Anna White, manager at the RSPCA's Southridge Animal Centre, in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, described it as one of the saddest cases she has seen.

'This poor puppy was brought to us in the cardboard box she was found in, and could not stand up, let alone walk, and definitely could not get out of the box,' she said.

'Her back legs were just not working properly and she was very, very poorly. And yet she was just left like this, on her own, on a busy London street in the freezing cold.

'She was tossed out, when she was at her most vulnerable. It is just heartbreaking.' 

X-rays revealed the dog had extensive spinal damage but vets were unable to ascertain whether it was due to the abuse or a birth defect.

RSPCA inspector Kate Ford said: 'We do not know how this poor dog came to be dumped in this way and can't be sure whether her health issues were something she was born with or were the result of some mistreatment.

'She was of a very distinct silver-hued colouring, and there have also been reports of other puppies in the area of North London with similar colouring, also being mistreated, so the concern is that there could be others out there in need of help. 

The eight puppies could have died after being dumped in a rubbish bin in Queenferry, North Wales

Eight tiny newborn puppies found in a rubbish bin were at the centre of an RSPCA investigation.   

The tiny pups - some with their umbilical cords still attached - were discovered by a group of a children in Queensferry, North Wales.

Bosses from the animal charity said they were stunned at how someone could throw away the animals as if they were rubbish.

As well as praising the quick-thinking actions of the youngsters who contacted a local dog warden after yesterday's shocking discovery in Chester Road East, officials also urged anyone with information to come forward.

RSPCA inspector Tim Jones said: 'It is totally unnecessary and these puppies could have died if nobody had heard them. They could not be seen in the bin.

'They all appeared to be fine but are very young as some of them had their umbilical cords still attached.'

'We are appealing for information to try and find out who abandoned these tiny dogs.'

The puppies - thought to be Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breeds - are now being cared for the RSPCA.

Anyone with information on the puppies should contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
