Prepared: Sir Benjamin Slade with his rifle and Bolly, his hunting companion

You can probably tell from the intrepid get-up and the rifle at his side, but Sir Benjamin Slade is a man on a mission – a mission to protect the public from a big cat that he says is stalking his estate.

He’d also rather like to mount its head on one of the walls in his 13th century manor house. 

The eccentric aristocrat fears the puma-like creature will kill a visitor if it is not shot dead and has put up signs around his 98-acre estate in Somerset, warning ramblers to be on the lookout.

Following numerous sightings, a staff member managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone.

Sir Benjamin, 67, who has named the cat the Beast of North Newton after the village nearest his estate, said: ‘I think it is bigger than most cats, probably bigger than a puma.

‘When I saw the photo, it was visibly huge. The grass in the  picture is two-and-a-half  foot high.

‘We need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog.

‘Plus, I need the head to put in my collection.’

Tom Baker, 25, the staff member who snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at Maunsel House, said: ‘I saw something about 150 metres away and didn’t know if it was a deer, but it looked strange. I zoomed in and took the images.

‘It certainly looks like a big cat. I have no other explanation for it.’

And he might just be right.

There have been a ‘substantial’ number of sightings of big cats in Somerset in the last year, according to Danny Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society.

Sir Benjamin claims to have seen the creature before, lurking behind a postbox, and in recent months, he and members of staff have found piles of feathers around the estate, as well as the remains of a dead fox.

He also fears the creature is feeling particularly defensive after visitors said they spotted cubs.

The baronet added: ‘I’ve put up signs to warn people and people have been keeping their dogs in their cars and haven’t let their children walk off in case they don’t come back.

'I have a wedding business to run here too. Luckily the guests make a bit of noise so this creature hopefully won’t come near. But they might get gobbled up if they wander off.’

However, Sir Benjamin conceded that Mr Baker’s photo is not conclusive.

‘They don’t exactly stand still and pose, which is the problem,’ he said.

He said he planned to collect hair and droppings to send off for analysis the next time animal remains are found.

Sir Benjamin, a childless millionaire, made headlines last year after police staged a dramatic raid on his home, which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured.

He said he used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window.
