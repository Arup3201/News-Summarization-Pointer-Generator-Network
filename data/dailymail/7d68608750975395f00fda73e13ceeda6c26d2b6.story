For Poldark’s legion of breathless female fans, the tension has been almost too much to bear.

Ever since heartthrob Aidan Turner, 31, burst onto our screens as the Cornish hero, women up and down the country have been working themselves into a frenzy over his brooding looks.

Debate has raged over just what makes him the perfect hunk, while last week’s glimpse of his toned torso in the sea had his admirers swooning – even though the scene lasted a mere 20 seconds.

Sensual abandon: Ross Poldark's lips caress Demelza's neck  as the steamy scene hots a crescendo

Passion boils over: The pair share their first kiss after an argument in episode three of the period drama

Bodice-tipper: Demelza returns to Poldark's bedroom where she asks him to help her to remove her dress

But if you thought the excitement was nearly over, think again. As these bodice-ripping photos reveal, the simmering attraction between Ross Poldark and Demelza is about to erupt into passion.

In the steamy scene, to air tomorrow night in episode three of the period drama, viewers will see the pair finally share their first kiss.

But it begins with an argument after the fiery Poldark accuses his housemaid of snooping. 

His harsh words reduce her to tears and moments later he regrets them. Seeking her forgiveness he leans towards her and their lips touch.

The pair then break away – only for Demelza to return to Poldark’s bedroom where she asks for his help to unfasten her dress.

Unable to resist, he obliges. And alluding to the gossip that has surrounded their relationship, he tells her: ‘You know what people say of us? If we behave like this it would be true.’ Demelza declares: ‘Then let it be true’ before the tousled Adonis kisses her neck with abandon.

Pillow talk: Demelza reclines on her master's bed. It is the first of many liaisons still to come between Poldark and the girl he rescued from life as a street urchin

It is the first of many liaisons still to come between Poldark and the girl he rescued from life as a street urchin. The trailer for episode four hints at an even steamier bedroom scene.

The growing attraction between Poldark and Demelza, played by 22-year-old Eleanor Tomlinson, has helped the BBC remake of the classic series attract almost 7million viewers per episode.

Last week, viewers saw redhead Demelza watching captivated from a clifftop as Poldark swam naked in the sea below. Many compared it to the scene from the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, when Colin Firth emerges from a lake in a soaking shirt.

One fan joked on Twitter: ‘If Poldark gets any hotter we’ll have to call the fire brigade.’ Another told MailOnline: ‘There isn’t a single woman I know who doesn’t think he’s absolutely gorgeous.’

The original 1970s series attracted audiences of up to 15million.
