Robin van Persie might be nursing an ankle injury but that didn't stop the striker making the most of Manchester's cold weather. 

With much of the city covered under a pretty white blanket, the Dutchman sculpted himself a snowman goalkeeper to position on a mini football pitch in his back yard.

He posted the pictures on his official Facebook account.

Van Persie missed United's 2-0 win over Queens Park Rangers on Saturday after hobbling off injured in United's previous game, a 1-0 loss to Southampton at Old Trafford.  

The injury also prevented him from attending FIFA's Ballon d'Or Awards ceremony last week, at which he was nominated for the Puskas Award, the gong handed to the player adjudged to have scored the best goal of the year.   

United are fourth in the Premier League table with 40 points from 22 games and are targeting qualification for next season's Champions League.
