Sir Benjamin Slade claims to have recently spotted a big cat roaming around his grounds

When eccentric aristocrat Sir Benjamin Slade picked up one of his many guns last month and strode out onto his estate, he claimed he was trying to protect the public from a mysterious big cat stalking his lands.

But it seems not everyone wanted his protection.

A member of the public complained to the police that they felt threatened after pictures of gun-toting Sir Benjamin, 67, were published in the Daily Mail and other newspapers.

The call resulted in a visit from armed police demanding to inspect his collection of 150 ﬁrearms.

The baronet had to intercept the ofﬁcers at the gates of Maunsel House, near Bridgwater, Somerset, as he had hired the venue out for a wedding and feared the guests would be upset.

Sir Benjamin, who made his fortune as a shipping magnate, said that it was the fourth time his guns had been investigated and that he had contacted his MP to complain about the police response.

He previously made headlines last year when police staged a dramatic raid on his home, which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured.

On that occasion he said he had used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window.

Sir Benjamin posed for the latest pictures after numerous sightings of what he claimed was a large puma stalking his grounds.

A staff member even managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone.

Sir Benjamin, who named the cat the Beast of North Newton after the village nearest his estate, told the Mail last month: ‘I think it is bigger than most cats, probably bigger than a puma.

‘When I saw the photo, it was visibly huge. The grass in the  picture is two-and-a-half foot high.

‘We need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog.

‘Plus, I need the head to put in my collection.’

A few days after the story was published Avon and Somerset Police telephoned Sir Benjamin to say they had received a complaint.

They arranged to inspect his weapons on Wednesday last week.

He told them he had a wedding booked that day but they would not reschedule - and he had no choice but to warn the couple that their happy day could be interrupted by a raid.

The ofﬁcers checked the gun from the photograph and were satisﬁed that it was deactivated, but Sir Benjamin had to persuade them not to do a full inspection of his 150 weapons, which include 400-year-old muskets, a tommy gun, blunderbusses, a 12-bore Churchill shotgun and an AK47 assault riﬂe.

The baronet, whose family have lived in Maunsel House since 1772 and are descended from royalty, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We tried to keep the police out the way. You’ve got to really, it makes people nervous, they might stop drinking.

‘They [the police] wanted to check every gun in the bar and the house … there are guns on the wall everywhere.

'They would have been all crawling around the bar and the house, pulling things off the wall, which is not very helpful.’

Sir Benjamin said his weapons were all deactivated and had been inspected by police two years ago.

The previous raid, last May, saw 18 armed ofﬁcers swarm the property in a raid that included roadblocks and a surveillance helicopter.

All his licensed guns were conﬁscated and so what remains of his collection is deactivated.

Deactivated weapons do not require a licence and are not covered by any legislation.

Sir Benjamin added: ‘We have Uzi machine guns, we have tommy guns, we have East German copies, we have American things, it helps get the sales up in the bar. They’re all deactivated, they do not work.’

Avon and Somerset police last night confirmed that they had visited Maunsel House.

Supt Ian Wylie said: ‘We received a call from a member of the public who was concerned about a ﬁrearm. We attended a property to carry out a check but are satisﬁed that the weapon is decommissioned.

'We take all calls about ﬁrearms very seriously and need to make sure that ﬁrearms holders have the appropriate licences.’
