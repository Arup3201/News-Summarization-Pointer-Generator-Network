Amanda Holden has made an extraordinary defence of her affair with actor Neil Morrissey, claiming she cheated on her husband because she needed ‘love and affirmation’.

The Britain’s Got Talent judge was married to comedian Les Dennis when she began the five-week fling in 2000, but insists that the relationship was ‘not about sex’.

She and Dennis split when news of the affair emerged. Although they were briefly reconciled, they separated in 2002 and were divorced the following year.

Holden's affair with Morrissey began while filming the BBC drama Happy Birthday Shakespeare

Miss Holden, 42, who is now married to music producer Chris Hughes, has previously described the fall-out from her affair with Morrissey, 51, the star of Men Behaving Badly, as ‘one of the darkest periods of my life’.

However, she said that despite his reputation as a hellraiser, she initially fell for him because he was ‘loving and caring’ and said he was wrongly blamed for his role in the scandal.

‘I don’t believe women have affairs for no reason,’ she said. ‘Women don’t seek sex – we seek love and affirmation. If a woman has an affair, there is normally a problem in their marriage. Neil rightly or wrongly got loads of stick.

The actress went on to marry Chris Hughes in December, 2008, and they have two children

‘I feel like it was my fault – I was the one who was married.

‘I want to change the general perception of him, as he was very caring and very loving and very worried about me because I lost so much weight. He used to cook for me and look after me and babysit the dogs.’

Miss Holden met Dennis when she was just 22 and he 38.

They were together for four years before marrying in June 1995.

She said that following her affair with Morrissey, which began while filming the BBC drama Happy Birthday Shakespeare, she was ‘thrown together’ with him again when she moved out of the home she shared with Dennis.

‘Our relationship continued longer than it would have done had we not been so in the public eye, because we had no one else to turn to,’ she said in an interview in the November issue of Good Housekeeping, which is out today.

The actress went on to marry Hughes in December 2008 and they have two children. Dennis also has two children from a subsequent marriage to 42-year-old life coach Claire Nicholson.

Speaking previously about her affair with Morrissey, Miss Holden said the backlash was the worst thing that ever happened to her.

‘I found the fall from grace incredibly hard to deal with,’ she said. ‘I can’t bear not to be liked. Then I had an affair and overnight turned into this awful person.

‘There are no hard feelings with Les. I wish him the best but we’ve both moved on.’
