But one student in particular has more than just his grades to celebrate.

A 19-year-old who lost 10st in 10 months after vowing to turn his life around is celebrating securing his dream of going to university.

Always larger, Thomas's weight caused him health problems as well as making him the victim of bullying

Thomas 
Lowson, from the Grenoside area of Sheffield suffered bullying and 
health problems when he reached 24st in January last year.

Now,
 after succeeding with a massive weight loss programme and moving to 
study A-levels at Sheffield College, Thomas has got the grades he needs 
to study English at Leeds Trinity University.

Celebrating this morning, he said: 'The world’s my oyster with results like this.

'Nerves
 have been setting in. It’s been a case of pacing back and forth in my 
house from 4am this morning - I’m paranoid and pessimistic.

'But now I’m guaranteed to go to uni. I needed a C and a D, and I got a C and a B. I’m obviously exhilarated by that result.

'I’m
 over the moon, I’m speechless, just to have this moment and to get 
here. Everything’s been worth it and all the hard work’s paid off.'

Thomas
 said he decided to move from his previous sixth-form mainly because 
bullying related to his weight was making him unhappy.

Thomas decided to turn his life around and lose weight, in part to pursue his dream of going to university

Thomas joined an NHS run weight loss program called Way Ahead, attending weekly sessions

Thomas attended weekly sessions to help him shift the weight, losing roughly 1st a month

'At secondary school, and in a year of sixth-form before I left, I was never happy,' he said.

'I was always quite large.

Thomas, pictured in 2007, had been a larger child from a young age

'At my heaviest, in January 2013, I weighed in at 24st which, I don’t need to explain, is an obscene amount to weigh.

'With the fresh start here (at Sheffield College), I decided to make the change and, with the help of the NHS and a practice they have called Way Ahead, which was 10 sessions over 10 weeks, I was able to lose 10 stone in 10 months, which changed my life.

'I notice it every day. Everything’s been worth it - every bit of hard work.

'It’s all been worth it to come here and have this moment.

'I’ve always wanted to go to university, that’s always been on my mind ever since I was young.'

Thomas got a C in English language, C in media studies and a B in film studies.

He
 said he is looking forward to his three-year degree course starting in 
September and is then hoping for a career in media, journalism or 
teaching.

Thomas’s
 mother Jayne Lowson said: 'He’s done absolutely fantastic and we’re so 
proud of him. We were very concerned about his weight.

'He left his other school and came here and I think that was the start. He was a lot happier and weight started to come off.'
