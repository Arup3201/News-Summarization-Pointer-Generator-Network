An adult film star who tested positive for HIV - causing the porn industry's third shut down this year - was reportedly trying to book a sex shoot after finding out his diagnosis.

The male star, who has not been identified but is known to authorities, attempted to book a scene with a female sex actress that would appear via webcam in the days following his positive test results, according to Radar Online.

'We can f--- but do it on cam,' he wrote in a text message obtained by industry blogger Mike South.

'Then it’s not cheating. It’s work.'

The woman agreed to the shoot, however pulled out after it emerged the actor had returned a positive result during the mandated fourteen-day industry disease screening.

'[The HIV-positive actor] contacted [the actress] on December 5th at 4PM PST and suggested that they do a webcam show together on Sat Dec 7th,' South wrote on his site, adding [the actress] 'indicated that she was booked to shoot that day, but Sunday would work. [The HIV-positive actor] agreed on Sunday.'

'This is clearly after [The HIV-positive actor] would at least know that he had tested positive for something, and I find it hard to believe that 48 hours after the test he didn’t know what, but he had to know that he wasn’t supposed to be shooting, he was even marked unavailable in [the industry testing system].

'This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable and it shows a total disregard for her life.

On Dec. 6, the Free Speech Coalition, an adult film industry trade group, announced its latest moratorium on filming, according to ABC News.

'We are taking every precaution while we do research to determine if there's been any threat to the performer pool,' Free Speech Coalition CEO Diane Duke said in a statement.

'We take the health of our performers very seriously, and felt that it was better to err on the side of caution while we determine whether anyone else may have been exposed.'

The male star at the center of the webcam claims is the cause of the moratorium.

The news comes more than a year after Los Angeles County voters passed a ballot initiative that made using condoms in porn mandatory, however the rule was never enforced and later ruled to be unconstitutional.

Porn star Cameron Bay, who has been appearing in XXX films since 2010, went public with her HIV diagnosis in August after it was revealed her boyfriend, Rod Daily, had also contracted the disease

In online post, the coalition 
explained that performers underwent mandatory testing for sexually 
transmitted infections every two weeks and that the performers prefer 
this to using condoms.

'Unfortunately, condoms aren't perfect,' the blog said.

'They
 break. In the shoots that can take several hours, they can cause 
abrasions known as condom rash which, paradoxically, can make it easier 
to transmit an infection if one does break.

'For this and a host of other reasons, performers generally prefer to rely on the testing system over condoms.'

Porn industry leaders have also said condoms were bad for business, leading to a decline in pornography sales.

As
 in previous HIV outbreaks, the industry is currently testing the 
performer's on-and-off-screen sex partners to make sure that the virus 
hasn't spread.

It expects to have results early this week, according to the Free Speech Coalition.

In August, porn star Cameron Bay tested positive for HIV, forcing a six-day filming moratorium.

On Aug. 28, the industry declared all performers who worked with Bay 'tested and cleared,' but on Sept. 4, Bay's boyfriend, porn actor Rod Daily, announced that he, too, tested positive for HIV.

Bay and Daily have since spoken out about unsafe industry practices. There is no suggestion Daily is the actor who tried to shoot scenes after his diagnosis. Several other porn actors have also since tested positive.

'Ultimately, it's just a big industry, and their main concern is money,' Daily said in a September news conference.

'If they do care that much about the performers, they would use condoms.'

On Sept. 6, a third actor, whose identity has been kept secret, tested positive for HIV, prompting the second industry shutdown.
