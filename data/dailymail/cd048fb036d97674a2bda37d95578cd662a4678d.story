With all its pop-up restaurants, quirky events and cultural centres, London, Paris and Brussels can be exciting playgrounds for singletons.

But go to the right place at the wrong time, and you could end up sitting with a local knitting circle rather than a trendy bar.

Now, a Belgium-based company has come up with a set of interactive heat maps that tells you exactly where and at what time you can ‘get lucky’.

Users can select which city they’d like to view in the top left hand corner of the map and drag the time line at the bottom of the map to see the hotspots. Red indicated the most popular areas, yellow for moderately-active areas and green for areas you are unlikely to get lucky

Monday - Holloway

Tuesday - Marylebone High Street

Wednesday - Lewisham

Thursday - Embankment

Friday - Leicester Square

Saturday - Knightsbridge

Sunday - Hammersmith  

Twoo, which describes itself as a 'global social network for meeting new people', has created maps for London, Belgium and Paris - areas where the app is currently available.

Users can select which city they’d like to view in the top left-hand corner of the map, and drag the timeline at the bottom of the map to see the hotspots.

Using the data from its global 11.9 million monthly unique visitors, Old Street in East London has been identified as most active area on a Friday night in the English capital.

Red on the map indicates the most popular areas, yellow marks moderately-active areas and green reveals areas you are unlikely to get lucky.

The map also allows you to zoom in to a particular region to find out the best places to visit on a street level.

Elephant and Castle at 10pm on a Thursday

Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd’s Bush at 9pm on a Tuesday

Vauxhall at 11pm on a Tuesday

Hoxton at 2am on a Tuesday

Piccadilly Circus at 5pm on a Wednesday

Meanwhile, Holloway, Marylebone, Lewisham, Leicester Square, Embankment, Knightsbridge and Hammersmith are the best places for meeting new people on your lunch break.

Londoners at a loose end on a Thursday should head down to Elephant and Castle, while Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd’s Bush is the place to be seen at 9pm on a Tuesday.

The map also reveals how Arsenal fans become more active around 11pm on a Saturday night.

And if you want to avoid the action, pressing the ‘get lucky’ button reveals the hotspots in London at that particular point in time.

‘Our heatmap shows exactly where they are most likely to get lucky on their lunch,’ said Nick Lisher chief marketing officer of Twoo.

‘So instead of grabbing the same sandwich from Pret and sitting in the park on your own, why not use an hour away from your desk to meet someone new?'

If you happen to be in Brussels on a Friday evening, Zellik in the north west of the city is the place to be seen, according to Twoo's 'Get Lucky' heatmap.

‘Interestingly though, the heatmap shows people are not necessarily consistently the most active in areas in and around central London, but instead they are up for meeting new people throughout wider London; from Hammersmith to Hoxton,' said Lisher.

‘Who knows, maybe one day we’ll make a heatmap for the whole world,’ the developers said.

Chalelet in Paris seems to be a popular place for people to meet according to the French version of the map (pictured). Users who want to avoid the action can press the 'get lucky' button to reveals the hotspots in each of the three featured cities. That way, they can plan their day around quieter areas
