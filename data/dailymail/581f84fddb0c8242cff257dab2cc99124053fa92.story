Arsenal fear Aaron Ramsey is set to be out for at least four weeks after suffering a hamstring injury against Leicester City on Wednesday night, but remain hopeful Alexis Sanchez will recover quickly from a knee injury.

Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign - with Mathieu Flamini taking the 24-year-old's position.

Speaking of Ramsey's injury after Arsenal's 2-1 Premier League win against Leicester, Arsene Wenger said: 'I cannot say it is not a worry, It is not good news.'

The Gunners moved back above Tottenham and Manchester United, who host Burnley on Wednesday evening, with an edgy victory over bottom club Leicester, which saw both Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez pick up injuries. 

It was far from an all-conquering display Wenger's men as they aimed to recover from defeat in the north London derby, but they looked comfortable leading 2-0 at half-time before allowing a spirited comeback from the Foxes.

Arsenal look to have avoided a double injury blow, however, as star man Sanchez is expected to miss no more that one game and even that would be as a precaution.

The 26-year-old started the midweek clash at the Emirates, after returning from a hamstring injury, but hurt his left knee and was under-par until he was replaced on 68 minuted by striker Olivier Giroud.

The incident came following a tackle by Leicester defender Matthew Upson, that left the 26-year-old nursing his knee with ice once he was substituted. 

After the game, Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as Wenger claimed.

'Sometimes the love for the game and anxiety to be on a football pitch works against you,' he tweeted.

The Chile international had missed the Gunners' previous two Premier League games against Aston Villa and arch-rivals Tottenham, and it is unclear at the moment if he will now be available for their FA Cup fifth round home clash against Championship leaders Middlesbrough on Sunday.

Jack Wilshere looks set to return to Arsenal's matchday squad this weekend for their FA Cup fifth round match against Middlesbrough. The English midfielder has been out for three months with an ankle injury.
