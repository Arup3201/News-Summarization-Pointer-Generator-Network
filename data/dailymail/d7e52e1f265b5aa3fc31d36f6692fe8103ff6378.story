When we buy a toasted sandwich maker or a coffee machine we might truly believe they will save us money on costly takeaway snacks and lattes.

The reality is that every toastie and coffee we make costs us £10.68, because such gadgets are used so rarely before being put in a cupboard to gather dust.

Two out of three households own appliances that have been used an average of six times, while 10 per cent are never touched, research has revealed.

Gathering dust: Toasted sandwich makers topped a list of kitchen gadgets that are widely owned but rarely used

Some 65 per cent of us own costly culinary devices, but rarely use them.

A total of 123 million bread makers, coffee machines, food processers 
and other kitchen devices, are gathering dusts on the shelves after 
shoppers were tempted into buying them without needing them.

Research from insurers Direct Line shows £8 billion worth of kitchen equipment is
left almost untouched in the home - based on the cost of the culinary 
contraptions averaging £65.51.

Waste: Some 65 per cent of us own pricey kitchen devices, but rarely take the time to use them

Approximately 10 per cent of the gadgets in homeowner’s cupboards have never even been used.

The main culprits and the percentage of people surveyed who own, but rarely use them:

The remaining devices have seen daylight an estimated six times, which 
brings the cost of toasting a sandwich, brewing a coffee or using any of
the gadgets people like to hide away, to around £10.68 each time.

Toasted sandwich makers are the most commonly owned but unused 
appliances, with 26 per cent of Britons possessing but rarely using one,
closely followed by food processors at 21 per cent.

A total of 19 per cent of us waste our money on buying slow cookers then rarely taking them out of the cupboard.

And the popular George Foreman grills are also high up on the list of pricey gadgets lying dormant in our homes.

Jenny Trueman, home insurance manager at Direct Line, said: ‘Cooking more
adventurous dishes at home is certainly a growing trend and perhaps a 
reason why we own so many of these pricey gadgets.

‘The value of these items really do add up and this is something worth 
remembering when it comes to home insurance.

'It is easy to underestimate
how much your possessions are worth so don’t forget the unused or 
unseen items in your home as these still count.’
