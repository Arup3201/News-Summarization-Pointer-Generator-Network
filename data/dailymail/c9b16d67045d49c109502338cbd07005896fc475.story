Nigerian striker Ideye Brown is still waiting to receive a visa and work permit so that he can join up with new club West Brom after sealing a £10million move from Dynamo Kiev.

The 25-year-old signed for Alan Irvine's side on July 18 but he has yet to travel back to the UK, forcing him to miss out on a pre-season friendly against Nottingham Forest.

He is also set to be unavailable for Tuesday's game with Port Vale and admits that playing any part in the Baggies' first game of the season against Sunderland is unlikely.

Not yet: Ideye Brown is waiting to receive a visa and work permit before joining up with new club West Brom

Ideye told BBC Sport: 'Officials at the British High Commission (in Nigeria) are still working on it.

'Realistically it will be difficult to target the first league game of the season for my debut.

'The club has fulfilled all the necessary requirements, but I have been told that the British High Commission require up to 15 days to sort this, which is preventing my ability to travel.

'The public holiday in Nigeria last week [Eid holiday] slowed things down a little bit on this side.

'I hope to get it sorted in the next couple of days because I can't wait to join my new team-mates in England.'
