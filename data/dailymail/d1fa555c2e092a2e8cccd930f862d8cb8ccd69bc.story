Serial rapist Dean Goodwin was jailed for nine terms of life imprisonment but told him he must serve a minimum of 15 years in jail

A serial sex offender who raped two women - leaving one for dead - while on the run from police was today jailed for life.

Judge Samuel Wiggs jailed Dean Goodwin, 32, to nine terms of life imprisonment but told him he must serve a minimum of 15 years in jail.

He had been released early from prison for similar offences before he carried out the horrific sex attacks last November in Dorset and Hampshire.

In 2000 Goodwin was jailed for 12 years for two sexual assaults on a 13-year-old girl and a 63-year-old woman.

He served 10 years of his sentence, and his name was placed on the sex offenders’ register. He was released from prison in 2010 and was kept under observation by the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) body.

Shaven-headed Goodwin sparked a massive manhunt after raping a 30-year-old woman in her flat in Poole, Dorset, in what was described in court as a degrading five-hour ordeal.

The 4ft 11in victim was attacked, forced to watch child porn and raped four times by burly 18-stone Goodwin after he barged into her home pretending to be the police.

During the ordeal he said: 'I’m not leaving until I get what I want.' When the attack was over he told the woman: ‘I’m off now - see you in court’.

A court heard how Goodwin had no self
control and later told police he had ‘wanted to go out with a bang’ 
after attacking his first victim.

The woman, who vaguely knew Goodwin, called the police and he became a wanted man, Bournemouth Crown Court was told.

A few days later Goodwin, who was high on cocaine and steroids, lay in wait in Andover, Hampshire, and attacked a complete stranger - a 49-year-old mother-of-two on her way home to take her children swimming, Kerry Maylin, prosecuting said.

She was dragged into the garden of a derelict house, raped and then beaten so badly she lost consciousness.

Miss Maylin told the court that Goodwin told her to 'watch it or I will kill you' and 'scream and I will kill you'. He then hit her repeatedly with his fists and a brick and left her for dead.

'She thought she was going to die. She thought the only way she would survive was to play dead,' the barrister explained.

The victim was not found for five hours until her shocked husband, out looking for her because she had not returned home, found her hypothermic.

The court was shown a picture of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in hospital so badly beaten her eyes are closed. She was in court with her husband to see her attacker jailed.

The court heard she has suffered what is likely to be permanent facial paralysis from nerve damage resulting from the attack and said the assault had 'destroyed my life and the lives of those I love.'

Goodwin, from Poole, was later arrested in Bournemouth and told police he thought he had killed the woman in Andover.

He admitted attempted murder, five counts of rape, sexual assault, false imprisonment, two counts of burglary and robbery. He committed his first sex offence against a five-year-old boy in 1994 when he was 14, the court was told.

He later physically attacked care staff and teachers and indecently assaulted two other women as well as committing burglary, robbery and car theft offences, serving lengthy jail terms.

A psychiatric report found he had a dangerous personality disorder and he told a psychiatrist “he wanted to go out with a bang” after the first rape.

Jailing him, Judge Samuel Wiggs said: 'You are very dangerous indeed. It may be that you want to stop yourself but it’s plain from all the evidence that you cannot.'

After the case, Detective Inspector Marcus Hester from Dorset Police said: 'Dean Goodwin was responsible for a number of heinous crimes and his victims were understandably left terrified by his vile actions.

'I believe that Goodwin poses a significant risk to the public, and this result means he will spend a minimum term of 15 years in prison.

'He will then be assessed and depending on whether it is safe to do so he may be released, or may spend the rest of his life in prison. I am certain that Dorset will be safer with Goodwin behind bars.'
