President Barack Obama quietly sent a group of administration officials to the border on Tuesday to assess the need for a National Guard deployment.

White House officials with knowledge of the trip told Reuters yesterday that a team of Homeland Security and Defense Department aides are on the three-day site visit to and will make recommendations to the president upon their return.

While 'there's no foregone conclusion' to the president's plans, as one official said, the move signals that the Obama is taking Republicans' suggestions on how to handle the border crisis more seriously than the White House has previously let on.

President Barack Obama is reportedly considering a National Guard deployment to border

House Speaker John Boehner and Texas 
Governor Rick Perry have been asking the president to dispatch the 
National Guard to the border for weeks. 

Perry tried to get Obama to commit to the measure during the president's trip to Texas earlier this month but couldn't get a straight answer from him. The Republican Governor sent a follow-up letter reiterating the need for troops but says he never received a response.

On
 Monday, Perry decided to act without the federal government and send as
 many as 1,000 of Texas' reserve forces down to the border. There, they'll work hand in hand with the Texas Department of Public Safety to take down drug smugglers and cartels, his office said in a statement on the governor's announcement.

The
 additional National Guard members and other law enforcement resources 
Perry directed toward the border will cost Texas taxpayers $5 million a 
week, according to a leaked memo. National Guard forces alone will burn a $12 million a month whole in the state's budget.

The funding for an enhanced National Guard presence on the border can only come from the 
federal government if the Commander in Chief initiates the deployment. Until
 then, Texans will be on the hook for the entire amount, causing 
concern among Texas lawmakers, including Perry's allies.

'We are very grateful to the 
Governor,' Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said, 'but we need to see that Texas is ultimately reimbursed.'

As
 recently as Monday the White House was still dismissing a deployment as
 'temporary' solution to the crisis at the border.

'The President and this administration does not see it in any way as a 
substitute for the kind of more enduring response that this 
administration has sought both through the supplemental appropriations 
request, but also through comprehensive immigration reform,' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.

'It seems to me that a much more powerful symbol would be the bipartisan
 passage of legislation that would actually make a historic investment 
in border security and send an additional 20,000 personnel to the 
border,' Earnest said.

Earnest admitted that the president indicated to Perry that he was open to the idea of sending down the National Guard when they met in Texas and said the subject could come up in the president's meeting that afternoon with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.

However, the White House spokesperson reiterated the administration would prefer Perry to 'take the kinds of steps that will be 
constructive to solving the problem over the long term' and not just the kinds that attract attention.

'And to be 
specific, that means that we hope that Governor Perry will support the 
supplemental appropriations request that this administration put forward
 a few weeks ago, and that Governor Perry will use his influence with 
congressional Republicans in Congress and urge them to stop blocking 
comprehensive bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives 
that would make an historic commitment to border security and address so
 many of the problems that are plaguing our broken immigration system,' he said.

The president's comprehensive immigration reform legislation has been stalled in the Senate for the last year and is almost certain not to get a vote in the House of Representatives before the end of the legislative session.

His $3.7 billion emergency immigration spending package could come to a vote by the end of next week, however.

If Democrats and Republicans on the Hill can't come to a consensus on how much of Obama's request to fund, however, the request for additional resources will be shelved until after Congress gets back from recess in September.

Senate Democrats, led by Appropriations chair Barbara Mikulski, have rallied around a $3.5 billion bill that includes funding for wildfires and aide for Israel on top of the $2.7 billion it puts toward agencies that handle illegal immigration.

House Republicans are discussing a $1.5 billion version of Obama's original ask. Their legislation also includes a stipulation about the National Guard. Conservatives in Congress say the current bill is still too much money, though, and want to see an even more stripped down version.

Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks told the Associated Press he wouldn't vote for the legislation if it came to the floor because the U.S. can't be the 'world's sugar daddy.'

Boehner's office this afternoon that the Republican caucus would hold a rare Friday morning meeting to discuss the bill one more time before heading home for the weekend because members needed more time to debate the bill.

Also at issue in the process is a 2008 trafficking law that disallows the U.S. government from immediately deporting illegal immigrant children who are not from Mexico or Canada.

Initially, the president told Congress he would like to see changes to the law that would give his administration ability to deport Central American children - who account for the majority of more than 57,000 minors who have arrived at the border since last October - in a more timely manner.

The president has since backed off that request amid pressure from him party.

In a letter to the president yesterday, Boehner asked Obama to recommit to the proposal.

'Frankly,' he said, 'it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this issue without strong, public support from the White House for much-needed reforms, including changes to the 2008 law.'

Worse, in recent days, senior congressional leaders in your own 
political party have backpedalled and voiced unswerving opposition to 
any changes at all.

Today Boehner again challenged the president to step up to the plate.

'We've got a President that's AWOL,' Boehner told reporters. 'The President ought to get engaged in this if he actually wants something to happen.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also called on the president to reassert his authority over Democrats in Congress.

McConnell said Obama put forward 'modest policy recommendations,' but 'unfortunately, the far Left objected, and he’s since wobbled.

'That’s led to top Democrats in Congress balking at even the most modest of reforms,' McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. '

They now seem to prefer a blank check that would preserve the status quo instead. And the President will barely lift a finger to encourage his own party to support these simple reforms.'

The top Republican lampooned Obama for his claims earlier this year that he going to use his 'pen and phone' to break through the gridlock in Washington.

'Use it,' McConnell said. 'Call the members of your party who object to what you said you wanted—and what we all know is needed.'

The president has been out of town since Tuesday on a fundraising trip on the West Coast, and he will not return to Washington, D.C. until late this evening. Tomorrow he will meet with Central American leaders to discuss ways the U.S. can work with their countries to prevent children from ever leaving for the United States in the first place.

Including tomorrow, the president has only six business days to come up with a plan that both political parties can swallow, or risk receiving no additional funding at all for border protection measures.
