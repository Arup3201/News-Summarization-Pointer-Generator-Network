Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, warned of the risks of splitting up the giant Government IT project which controls people's tax returns

Plans to split up a giant government computer system holding the tax records of 50 million Britons could end in ‘disaster’, ministers have been warned.

The Government wants to split its £10billion tax collecting IT system into 100 separate parts.

But MPs fear the ‘Aspire’ system – which collects £500billion of income tax every year, while also processing millions of tax returns, child benefit payments and tax credits – is too important to fiddle with.

The giant IT contract, run by the technology company Capgemini for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, has already spiralled out of control with costs almost trebling in ten years, according to the Times newspaper.

But MPs are concerned that the plan to split the contract into 100 smaller packages in 2017 could result in chaos.

Fears have been raised that private tax information could be lost if the new smaller contracts fail to work together.

Richard Bacon, a Tory on the public accounts committee, told the Times: ‘This is one of the biggest IT contracts in the world.

‘There is nothing more critical than getting tax in, and you can’t start relying on hundreds of experimental start-ups taking this over. The potential for another disaster is huge.’

Mr Bacon added: ‘I am a great believer in getting smaller companies in, but if you split the project up into 100 pieces, you need 500 skilled people to manage it. You cannot afford to get this wrong.’

Tom Gash, director of research at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, said there was ‘a big risk that the department may find it all too difficult’.

Jim Bligh, the head of public services policy at the CBI, meanwhile, warned that bringing in smaller companies would be difficult for Whitehall to manage.

He said: ‘You would need to have a relationship with every one of the contractors and manage the whole contract. That is a very hard thing to do,’ he said.

Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, said: ‘It would be a mistake to run before you can walk.

‘And unless there are people in HMRC with the necessary skills in managing a number of smaller contracts then you will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.’

But the Government insisted the new contracts would improve the system. An HMRC spokesman added: ‘We will renew our IT contract within Cabinet Office guidelines and on time. We will continue to improve the performance of the contract over the next three years.’

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude announced that all Whitehall IT contracts would be limited to £100m to give smaller companies a chance of winning business off the Government

Earlier this year Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, announced that all new IT contracts would be limited to £100 million to allow small and medium-sized companies to compete for government business.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said that Aspire was a ‘legacy contract’.

The spokesman said: ‘HMRC intends to break this contract into packages, which is entirely in line with our new approach and will ensure competition from the widest possible range of suppliers.’
