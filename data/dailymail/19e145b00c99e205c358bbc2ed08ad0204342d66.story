Stiliyan Petrov will return to Aston Villa as part of Tim Sherwood's backroom team.

The former Villa and Celtic midfielder has joined the club's staff and will help to coach the senior squad.

Petrov, now 35, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012 and retired in May 2013 despite being in remission.

Sherwood said: 'Stiliyan isn’t here to be a mascot. He can contribute to everybody just with what he’s done in his life.

'Going out to win a football match is secondary to what he has had to battle with and come through.

'I want him here and quickly. He is respected here and he is very important.

'He’s well and he’s raring to go. He knows the fabric of this club and he is just an inspiration to everyone to be honest.'

Sherwood says battling relegation is not life and death like some would make out.

'What he’s gone through is life and death. Playing a game of football is not life-threatening.’

'That doesn’t mean it’s not important but you have to put things in perspective.'

He added: 'Like I said, he’s not there as a mascot, he’s back for what he can offer.

'Why shouldn’t we open up our arms to him? I want him to help us. We’re not paying him! He’s on flexitime.’

Sherwood added: 'He would have been great to have back at this club without the illness.

'You can’t help but be inspired by him and what he has done in his career and his life.'

Villa are 17th in the Barclays Premier League and host West Brom in the FA Cup quarter final on Saturday, after their 2-1 league win over the Baggies on Tuesday.
