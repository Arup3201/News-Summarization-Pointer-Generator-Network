Natascha Kampusch, abducted on her way home from school in 1998, released a book called 3,096 Days - based on her time in captivity

A rogue policeman who attempted to obtain a DNA sample from a young girl to prove that she was the daughter of kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch has been jailed for ten months.

The Viennese officer was carrying out an illegal investigation in an attempt to expose a theory behind the notorious Austrian abduction - that there was more than one abuser involved. 

In 2011 and 2012, he went into a primary school in Modling, Lower Austria, to try to get the DNA sample.

He wanted to prove not only that the young girl was the daughter of Ms Kampusch, but that she had been sexually abused by accomplices of Ms Kampusch's abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil.

After being found guilty of an abuse of office, the suspended 63-year-old police officer must now serve a ten-month prison sentence,The Local reports. 

His case is closely connected to the retired president of Austria’s Supreme Court, Johann Rzeszut, who last year was part of a commission charged with investigating official negligence in the Kampusch case.

Mr Rzeszut said that he found 27 inconsistencies and omissions in the case and claimed that police ignored several vital pieces of evidence. 

It is alleged that the influential former judge is the one who first persuaded the jailed police officer to look into the case - asking him to find proof that Priklopil had not acted alone.

Natascha Kampusch was 10 years old when she was taken by Wolfgang Priklopil while on her way home from school in 1998.

Priklopil carved a secret, sound-proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of Vienna in which to keep her captive for eight years.

Long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her, Miss Kampusch finally escaped in August 2006.

When Priklopil realised she had got out of the house, he killed himself by lying down in front of an oncoming train.

Since then, the case has been shrouded in mystery.

In 2010, a leading policeman, Oberst Franz Kroell, was assigned to investigate the possibility that Priklopil did not act alone.

Six months after the probe ended, and after concluding that it was unlikely Priklopil did act alone, he was found shot dead on the terrace of his home in Graz. 

At first his death was labelled as suicide, but last year Austrian authorities suggested he may have been murdered.

The controversy sparked an independent investigation into the death and the original handling of the Kampusch case -  led by Johann Rzeszut - the man said to have hired the rogue policeman just jailed.
