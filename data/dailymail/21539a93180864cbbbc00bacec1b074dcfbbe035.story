Andy Murray’s name was engraved on the Wimbledon trophy last year by a 76-year-old man who had driven 850 miles across Europe.

Roman Zoltowski makes the annual odyssey from his home in Poland in his 52-year-old open-top MG sports car to perform his cherished role at the Championships.

He will be back again this year to engrave the men’s and ladies' trophies for the 35th successive year.

Mr Zoltowski said: ‘A 76-year-old man driving from Poland in his 52-year-old car to do the engraving – it’s quite surreal isn’t it?’

‘I sit in the engraving room, under the Royal Box just off Centre Court, with the television so I can watch the game.

‘The trophy is presented to players on court. When it comes back, covered in sweat and kisses, I engrave it and return it ready for interviews with the champion.’

Married father Mr Zoltowski started the job in 1979 while living in Wimbledon, south-west London, and working for Halfhide, the jewellers who supply the trophies and silverware to the All England Club.

He has continued the job even after returning to his native Poland in 1995. Mr Zoltowski cannot fly because the small, sharp chisels he uses are considered offensive weapons by airlines.

So instead he packs them into his car – together with anglepoise lamps, dusters, silver cleaning fluid, tapes and magnifying glasses - and sets off in the middle weekend of the championship to make his trans-Europe trek to be in SW19 in time for the finals.

He also fills up with provisions including sandwiches, cheese, liver, sausages and energy drinks for the 18 hour journey which takes him through Germany, Holland and Belgium, stopping off with friends on route.

His job has become harder in the last four years after the All England Club decided to include Christian names rather than initials on the trophy.

He added: ‘Sunday is stressful. You learn to switch off. You don’t talk. But the weekend is the highlight of my year. I'm not ready to retire and wear slippers yet.

‘My year divides between before and after Wimbledons. It's a special moment receiving the trophies after they've been presented to the players.’

Mr Zoltowski and his family fled to Britain in 1947 after their home was seized by the Communists and turned into a collective farm.

They had earlier been sent to Siberia by the invading Russians, where his father is believed to have been shot by what is now the KGB.

After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Mr Zoltowski and his siblings bought back their old family home and returned to Poland.
