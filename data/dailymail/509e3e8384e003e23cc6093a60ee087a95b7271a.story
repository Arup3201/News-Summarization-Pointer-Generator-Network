Alistair Darling has warned Scots not to be bullied into a Yes vote, as thousands marched in Glasgow attacking the BBC’s ‘biased’ coverage of the referendum.

The former Labour chancellor, leader of the pro-union Better Together campaign, claimed he had felt ‘menaced’ during the campaign, saying: ‘I have been involved in political campaigning for about 35 years and I have never seen anything like this before.’

He added: ‘I think we will win as I don’t think Scotland is going to get bullied into accepting something it doesn’t want.’

Yes campaigners stage a march towards the BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow   to protest against alleged biased by the BBC in its coverage of the Scottish independence referendum

Yes campaigners took to the BBC's Scottish HQ after a clash between Alex Salmond and BBC political editor Nick Robinson, who was accused of 'heckling' the First Minister

His comments came as it emerged that all police leave had been cancelled for the day of the vote, with polling staff warned to expect ‘confrontational behaviour’. 

Almost 3.5million people will attend polling stations on Thursday – with staff told to prepare for ‘serious disturbances’.

In recent weeks the debate reached boiling point, after abuse, vandalism and threats of violence were doled out by both sides. And yesterday up to 1,000 nationalists marched through Glasgow with placards attacking the BBC’s Nick Robinson. 

Mr Salmond dodged the political editor’s question at a press conference last week, then accused him of ‘heckling’.

Independence activists at the meeting applauded Mr Salmond and shouted ‘biased BBC’. 

Gathering: The police estimated that up to 1,000 people had attended the demonstration in Glasgow

Anger: Scottish nationalists believe the BBC has given a one-sided view of the debate

Mr Robinson was later accused by Yes campaigners of producing an ‘inaccurate’ report about the confrontation and yesterday Mr Salmond said the BBC was ‘absolutely’ biased. 

Radio 2 DJ Ken Bruce today risked fanning the flames of the debate by playing Al Green's 1972 hit Let's Stay Together - one Scottish fan tweeted that it was a 'hidden message', although the Glaswegian Mr Bruce has not publicly commented on the referendum.

However, a BBC spokesman defended their coverage, calling it ‘rigorously impartial’.

Yesterday Mr Salmond admitted that there would not be another referendum on separation for a generation – but with polls indicating strongest support for No among the over-60s, he claimed Scotland would eventually break away from the UK whatever the vote’s outcome. 

He declared: ‘There isn’t so much as a No vote in Scotland – only deferred Yesses.’

Fury: Demonstrators held up placards denouncing the BBC's coverage over the past few months

Tense: The protest came after weeks of anger over alleged bias in the BBC

Reaction: Unionists accused the protesters of focussing on irrelevant issues in the run-up to the vote

And despite polls indicating that the race is still too close to call, Mr Salmond promised a ‘day of celebration’ after a Yes vote and invited Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling to join ‘Team Scotland’ to negotiate the end of the Union.

But Mr Darling claimed Scotland’s fate now lies in the hands of around 500,000 undecided voters, before accusing Mr Salmond of embarking on a ‘premature victory lap’. 

And on his tenth campaign visit to Scotland today, David Cameron will warn voters that there will be ‘no way back’ if they choose to leave the UK, calling the vote ‘a once-and-for-all decision’.
