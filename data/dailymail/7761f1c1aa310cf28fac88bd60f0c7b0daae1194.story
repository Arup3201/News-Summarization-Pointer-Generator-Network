The Titanic might have hit the fatal iceberg because of a rare weather condition that created a 'fake horizon', leaving the crew unaware of the threat until it was too late.

The same rare phenomenon, found by a historian studying studying weather records unseen for a century, might also have meant that a nearby ship, The Californian, was unaware of the scale of the disaster and failed to save passengers from the stricken liner.

The 'cold weather mirage' occurs when a cold weather front collides with warmer air and causes light passing between the boundary of the two to be bent dramatically, distorting how an object appears.

Look-outs on-board the Titanic could not
see the approaching iceberg because the optical illusion created a fake
horizon above sea level which concealed it from view.

The theory also explains why Stanley Lord, captain of the nearest ship The Californian, ignored the sinking vessel because the illusion made it look like a much smaller ship.

British historian and author Tim Maltin outlines his findings in a TV documentary for National Geographic Channel to be aired. He claims his theory ties not only with weather records but also with eyewitness accounts.

He said: ‘It does actually make me feel sorry for Captain Lord, knowing now what I know about the science of that night.When he is apparently making excuses, saying the ship he was looking at did not look anything like the Titanic, what I now understand is that he was telling the exact truth.In fact, what he was looking at did not look anything like the Titanic at all.’

Unusually high-pressure weather also played a part in the tragedy, according to Mr Maltin.

‘A weather chart of the North 
Atlantic from April 1912 reveals that the Titanic actually sank right in
the centre of a 1,035-millibar Arctic high.

‘To put that into context, that is the highest pressure anywhere in the northern hemisphere.

‘So this menacing Arctic high which built up over the North Pole swung down and zeroed in on Titanic's crash site.‘It's
almost as though the Titanic sank in a killing zone of nature where all
these dangerous elements combined to make it fatal.’

Mr Maltin, 39, from Wiltshire, unearthed weather records and the logs of other ships in the North Atlantic at the time that have remained unseen in archives for a century.

Along with survivors' testimony, he pieced together how the tragedy most likely unfolded on that fateful night on April 15, 1912.

Using contemporary records, Mr Maltin discovered the ship sank at the exact location and time that freezing waters from the Arctic flowing along the Labrador Current met hotter air from the Gulf Stream.

And because this bent the light rays passing through the air at this point - completely obscuring the iceberg on the horizon - the doomed liner sailed directly towards it for a full 20 minutes, when under normal circumstances it would have been in clear view of the look-outs.

Mr Maltin - author of the book '101 Things You Thought You Knew About The Titanic...But Didn't!' - said his mirage theory also explains why Captain Stanley Lord, whose ship The Californian was just 10 miles away, did not attempt a rescue because the illusion made the Titanic look like a much smaller ship.

Mr Maltin said the 1,500 people who died in the disaster could still have been saved even after the collision with the iceberg but the cold-water mirage made the ship's SOS Morse lamp signals appear to the crew of the Californian to be the mast flickering under the stars or ordinary lights on the deck.

‘I've spent years wondering why these two ships which were trying to Morse each other all night couldn't communicate,’ said Mr Maltin.

‘A phenomenon known as scintillation scrambled Titanic's Morse lamp signals and it meant that the nearby ship, instead of realising it was the Titanic and coming straight to her aid, never came to her aid.’

Scintillation is the same effect that makes stars appear to twinkle as the light is distorted when it passes through the Earth's atmosphere.

Mr Maltin said the logs of German and British ships near the area at the time recorded a massive drop in temperature around the site of the sinking, which he believes is proof that the conditions were perfect to create a mirage that would have hidden an iceberg from view.

He added that survivors' testimony backed this up, particularly those who recalled seeing a column of smoke rise from the sinking ship before flattening out like a mushroom cloud, which indicates a large difference in the layers of air pressure and temperature.
