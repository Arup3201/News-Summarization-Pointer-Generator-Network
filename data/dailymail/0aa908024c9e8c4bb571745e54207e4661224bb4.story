More than two million people have apparently been to see Pope Francis speak in St Peter's Square since he was elected in March.

That is four times as many as Benedict attracted to the Vatican last year - suggesting that Francis' warm demeanour and open-minded pronouncements has boosted public support for the Catholic Church.

The Vatican announced yesterday that 1,548,500 tickets have been issued so far for Francis' general audiences in St Peter's Square.

Popular: Pope Francis has drawn more than 2million people to St Peter's Square this year, according to the Vatican

The total number attending was 'much larger', according to officials, because overflow areas nearby, which do not require tickets, are regularly filled with around 20,000 people.

The events, which usually take place on Wednesdays, have been held 30 times since the Pope was elected on March 13.

By comparison, 447,000 tickets were issued for general audiences with Benedict XVI during the whole of 2012.

Francis was last week named Person of the Year by Time magazine, having impressed many with his outgoing and friendly style.

Crowds: Even overflow areas have often been full of Catholics wanting to see the new Pope

He has forsaken many of the trappings used by his predecessors, choosing to live in a small flat in a guest house and using a regular car instead of the papal limousine.

Francis drawn popularity because of his statements urging the Church to be closer to the poor and to be more merciful and less condemning.

The crowds at Francis' general audiences have often topped 100,000, forcing police to close off the main boulevard leading to the Vatican to accommodate more people.

Contrast: Benedict XVI drew only a quarter of the number of people during his audiences last year

The Vatican newspaper said Francis telephoned Benedict to exchange Christmas greetings.

Benedict is living in a former convent on the Vatican grounds and has the title Pope Emeritus.

Tickets to audiences and all other papal events are issued for free by the Vatican's Prefecture of the Pontifical Household and usually distributed through parishes and Church institutions
