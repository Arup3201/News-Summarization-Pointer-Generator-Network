It is understood director-general Tony Hall wants it to compete with the websites of other broadcasters and online viewing services such as Netflix

The BBC is to launch a new version of its iPlayer website that allows viewers to personalise it with their favourite programmes.

With a version up and running by Christmas, the service will be more interactive by allowing users to customise the main page.

It is understood director-general Tony Hall wants it to compete with the websites of other broadcasters and online viewing services such as Netflix.

His vision to put online viewing at 
the heart of the corporation’s future will be announced tomorrow in his 
first major speech since taking over in April.

In
the talk, entitled Where Next?, he will set out a decade-long blueprint
to address the BBC’s technological challenges as more people choose to 
watch shows online rather than on television sets.

The
iPlayer now has more than 240million hits per month since it launched 
in 2007, and a growing number of viewers access it via smartphones and 
tablets.

It is thought Lord Hall will also try
to draw a line under several crises at the BBC, including the Jimmy 
Savile scandal and the severance pay-off furore.

He will promise to make the BBC a better-run organisation, with fewer layers of management and less bureaucracy.

It is thought he will call for a return to the values of the BBC’s first director-general Lord Reith, with funding for arts programmes to be increased by 20 per cent.

Lord Hall’s speech is also seen as the first step in a campaign to renew the BBC’s ten-year Royal Charter and protect the current licence fee funding agreements, which will expire in 2016.
