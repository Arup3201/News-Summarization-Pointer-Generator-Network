A new study shows that about one third of American's don't believe in Evolution and believe that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time.

The Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of Americans believe that 'humans and other things have evolved over time' but that 33 percent think they were the only human form to ever set foot on the Earth.

The study was conducted March 21-April 8, 2013, with a representative sample of 1,983 adults, ages 18 and older. The survey was conducted on landlines and cellphones in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. The margin of error was only three percentage points.  

Creationism versus Evolution: Research has found a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to how man came to be

One third of Americans still believe in Creationism versus Evolution

Surprisingly enough, of the group of people who believe in evolution, 32 percent believe that evolution was due to natural selection, and roughly 24 per cent believe that, 'a supreme being guided the evolution of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in the form it exists today.'

78 per cent of Mainline Protestants believe that humans and other animals evolved over time reported the Huffington Post.

According to PEW, the belief in creationism versus evolution is closely linked to religious background and race. two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants don't believe in evolution whereas half of black evangelical Protestants do.

When those people polled were divided by their religious affiliation the results showed that majority of white evangelicals believe that a supreme being guided evolution

There was also a disparity between believing in evolution versus creationism when examining political parties.

Currently, 43 per cent of Republicans believe in evolution and 67 per cent of Democrats believe in human evolution. In 2009,a greater number of republicans, 54 per cent, believed in evolution, and 64 per cent of democrats believed in evolution.

The study also investigated the differences between demographic groups and also  the differences in language.

They worded the evolution question in two different ways. One way they phrased it as 'humans and other living things' and the other way they phrased it was as 'animals and other living things.'

They found that exchanging animals for humans made very little difference in people's beliefs about evolution.

However, the study found that men were more likely than women to believe that humans/ animals and other living things evolved.

They also found those who had completed a for of higher education believed in evolution more than people who hadn't.

The number of Republicans who believe in human evolution has declined nine percent since 2009
