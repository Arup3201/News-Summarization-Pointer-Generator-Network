Your shopping list doesn’t just save time at the supermarket – it also helps keep you slim.

Writing a detailed list of groceries needed can contribute to weight loss by steering shoppers away from fattening temptations, researchers have found.

Their study concluded those who wrote a list were more likely to lose weight than those who didn’t.

Study leader Dr Nicole Au of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia said: ‘Many consumers know all too well 
that over-eating and under-exercising will lead to weight gain and 
increased risk of chronic illness.

‘But impulsiveness or poor self-control leads people to behave in a manner that departs from their good intentions.

‘Our
 findings provide evidence that shopping to a list is likely to be a 
cost-effective means through which the NHS could reduce obesity and its 
related illnesses.’

Obesity has emerged as a major burden on the NHS and the ready availability of fattening foods makes it hard to resist hunger pangs when they strike during the day.

Recent figures showed the number of people admitted to hospital for obesity-related illnesses has shot up by more than 10 times in the past decade.

Health experts predict Britain’s obesity epidemic will cost the NHS and the economy £60bn annually by 2050.

Yet two out of five dieters quit within the first seven days and nearly 65 per cent return to their pre-weight diet within three years of starting to watch what they eat.

The new study, published in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes, looked at 163 overweight women. All the women were given standard advice on diet and exercise but half were also provided with detailed meal plans and shopping lists that they had to stick to.

Over the next six months, the women with shopping lists lost an average of around 12 kilogrammes – or just under two stones.

The rest lost an average of just eight kilos – or one stone three pounds.

However, buying groceries online – rather than browsing in supermarkets – did not have the same positive effect.

Shoppers were still likely to impulse buy from their home computer.

British experts said last night writing a shopping list signifies a degree of commitment that can help to ward off impulse buying.

‘It means you have already put in the mental effort before you even leave the house,’ said psychologist Paul Buckley, from Cardiff Metropolitan University.

‘Supermarkets would much prefer that you did all your thinking once you get there so that you’re more open to persuasion and end up spending more.’
