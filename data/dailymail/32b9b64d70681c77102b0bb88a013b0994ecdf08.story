Whilst Kemar Bailey-Cole has been on the track surging to 100m glory at the Commonwealth Games, his superstar Jamaican team-mate Usain Bolt has been training hard in preparation for the relay.

Bailey-Cole won gold in the 100m in Glasgow on Monday night, edging out England's Adam Gemili into silver.

'It feels very good to have the spotlight on me once,' the 22-year-old said.

And it is little surprise, considering he lives in the shadow of the likes of Bolt and Yohan Blake.

'I'm not looking towards Usain. I'm just looking towards me, getting my things and achieving my dreams - winning as many races as I can and getting as much gold.'

But he will be looking towards Bolt soon, as they prepare to compete together for Jamaica in the 4x100m relay heats that begin on Friday.
