When he first started his rounds the Beatles were at number one with Can't Buy Me Love and Harold Wilson was Prime Minster.

Adam Kelly, from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, has seen a lot of changes since but one thing has remained the same - his ice cream business, which is still going strong after 48 years.

And luckily for his customers, Mr Kelly has no plans to hang up his scoop, despite celebrating his 90th birthday tomorrow.

The 'man in the reed van' may celebrate with a vanilla cone (he doesn't touch any other flavours) but certainly won't be taking the day off. Instead it will be business as usual for Britain's oldest ice-cream seller who hasn't taken a sick day in 48 years at the wheel of Adam's Ices.

D'you want a flake with that kids? Britain's oldest ice-cream man Adam Kelly from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders will celebrate his 90th birthday tomorrow - by doing the rounds in his van as usual

Back in the day: Mr Kelly serves a customer from his ambulance-turned-ice-cream-van in the 1980s.The sweet treat connoisseur only eats vanilla ice cream himself

He even carried on working after being mugged on his round 10 years ago. And the pensioner, who scoops six days a week, said he has no plans to retire.

Mr Kelly, who only eats vanilla ice cream, said: 'I've
never been used to sitting about. I enjoy meeting people and over the 
years I have got to know everybody, and they all know me.

'When I first started, the price of a cones was just three pence - now it's £1.20.'

Mr Kelly left school aged 15 in 1937 and began work on his dad's farm driving around in a horse and cart.
Two years later his father died and the young lad took a job at a 
nearby creamery delivering milk to farms in the area in a much larger 
tanker.

Carry on scooping: Mr Kelly hasn't taken a single day off sick in his 48 years at the wheel of Adam's Ices. He says he's 'never been used to sitting about' and enjoys meeting people

Nice ices: In 1941, aged 19, he was called up to 
the Army. The young soldier travelled around Africa transporting vital 
ammunition and fuel

In 1941, aged 19, he was called up to the Army. The young soldier travelled around Africa transporting vital ammunition and fuel.

His military career continued in El Alamein, Libya, Tripoli, Tunisia and Italy until he was eventually dispatched to Normandy as part of the D-Day landings in 1944.

The brave teenager was one of only a few soldiers in the 51st Highland Division of the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), charged with sneaking over the front line in the dead of night to bury ammunition in the ground in anticipation of the next day's planned attack.

In the beginning: Bar his war years, Mr Kelly has always been in the dairy business. His first job was delivering milk and cream on his father's horse and cart when he was 15

Hero: In 1941 he was called up to the Army, left, and dispatched to Normandy as part of the D-Day landings in 1944. After the war he returned to his job at a creamery delivering to farms in a much larger tanker, right

After being de-mobbed in 1947 Mr Kelly, who reached the rank of corporal, returned to his delivery job in the creamery when he met his wife Elizabeth, now 84, stranded at a bus stop while on his rounds.

The charming young driver offered her a lift and five years later they married, buying their first house for just £60.

Mr Kelly began taking evening shifts driving the ice-cream van of army friend and cafe owner Tony Macari in 1964.

The old van man, who has his own Facebook appreciation page with more than 600 fans, said: 'I wasn't very keen at first.

Saving lives with ice cream: In the 1980s Mr Kelly did his rounds in this van which he converted from an old ambulance

'I would start at 5.30am doing my milk rounds, finish at dinner time, and then go out in the ice-cream van at night.'

Two years later Mr Kelly went into business on his own using a Bedford van travelling 20 miles on every round and going through up to four gallons of ice cream a day.

Since then he has converted a variety of different vehicles including an ambulance, a water board van and a former Royal Mail vehicle, fitting them all with the distinctive ice cream van jingle.

He eventually expanded his business and uses his van as a miniature shop selling sweets, crisps and even mobile phone credit top ups.

The committed businessman will also mark his diamond wedding anniversary to Elizabeth, in October.

He added: 'I still work six days a week, taking Monday off, which keeps me active and Elizabeth doesn't seem to mind.

'I was mugged and robbed while on my round 10 years ago, but it would take more than that to stop me.

'I work from 2.30pm to around 8pm in the spring and summer but the smiles of the children when they hear my coming makes it all worth while.'

Mr Kelly has now been recognised by the Ice Cream Alliance, based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, as the oldest in his trade.

Happy birthday Mr Kelly!
