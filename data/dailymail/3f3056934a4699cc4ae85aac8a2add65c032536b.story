Former Arsenal forward Gervinho saw red at the Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday after he slapped Guinea forward Naby Keita.

Guinea had taken a shock lead in the first half of the match, and the Ivory Coast were desperately searching for an equaliser when red mist descended on the Roma man.

In a seemingly unprovoked attack, Gervinho turned to slap his opposition player, knocking him to the floor as he caught him.

The referee brandished a red card to the 27-year-old, who reacted in remarkable fashion - throwing himself to the ground in disbelief.

Helped up by his team-mates, Gervinho was led from the pitch, shocked at the referee's decision. Replays, though, clearly showed the forward catching Keita.

Shortly after, Seydou Doumbia drew the Ivory Coast level, perhaps taking some heat off his team-mate's reckless decision.
