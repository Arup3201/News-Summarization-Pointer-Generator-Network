The man in charge of World Cup preparations in Belo Horizonte holds no fears if hosts Brazil go out of the tournament in Tuesday's semi-final against Germany.

Camillo Fraga, the city's municipal secretary for the World Cup, did not anticipate defeat leading to an outbreak of the kind of protests seen at last year's Confederations Cup.

Fraga said: 'If Brazil wins it will be perfect, but if not then they will have reached the semi-final so that will be respectable.

'I have no concerns about the reaction. The climate has changed a lot since last year and now everyone has been really involved in the World Cup.'

Belo Horizonte's preparations were dealt a serious blow last week when a fly-over which was under construction collapsed onto the road underneath, trapping a number of vehicles and leading to two deaths.

The tragedy happened about three miles from the stadium and Fraga said a transport plan for the semi-final had been put in place to ensure there were no additional delays.

He added: 'This disaster was a really terrible thing to happen, we lost two people and I couldn't sleep at night.

'We were ending our participation in the World Cup in just a few days and then this disaster happened.'
