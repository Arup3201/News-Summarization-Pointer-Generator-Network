A French Vine star has achieved the impossible and convinced Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour to give him a tender kiss on the cheek, while he captured the whole thing on camera.

The steely editor, who just last year said she would never take a selfie, happily posed with 24-year-old Vine and Snapchat sensation Jerome Jarre yesterday as he filmed the short behind-the-scenes clip of the Valentino show at Paris Fashion Week.

Ms Wintour can be seen laughing before Jerome points to his cheek and asked: 'Can I have a little kiss?'

Mission impossible: Ms Wintour gave a rare smile while posing for a selfie with Jerome. The 24-year-old vlogger shared the video with his 8.2 million Vine followers 

After she obliged and gave him a quick peck on the cheek, Jerome let out a quick exclamation of delight.

Jerome then shared the adorable video with his 8.2 million fans on Vine, writing: 'How to get a little kiss from Anna Wintour!'

The footage, which was also shared on his Twitter account, prompted one fan to comment: 'Yep. No doubt you are the Vine king.'

Getting a photo with Ms Winour is no easy feat. 

During New York Fashion Week last month, she was chased down by a fan trying snap a selfie with her after the Oscar de la Renta show, but she scared him off with a disdainful glare. 

And in a 73 questions interview she conducted for her own magazine’s website last September, Ms Wintour stated: 'I've never taken a selfie and I don't plan to start now.’ 

Her change of heart may have been the result of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's epic return to the runway as they channeled their Zoolander alter-egos for the fall/winter 2015 show.

We never thought we'd be doing Fashion Finder on Derek Zoolander. It's like a fashion dream come true.

Praise be to Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, the Creative Directors at Valentino, for giving everyone a laugh at Paris Fashion Week by sending Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson down their AW15 catwalk. We can't actually believe this has never been done before. It's just too good.

But of course both men were kitted out in full looks from the high end label with Ben rocking a suit from the Fall 2015 Menswear collection. If you look closely you can see a butterfly pattern in silk jacquard that gives it that luxe shine. Very dapper!

And this suit on Ben, aka Zoolander, has reminded us that fashion should be fun and menswear in particular can be a little dull, so gentleman, can we suggest you liven up your look?

We've picked some sharp styles from the likes of Topman and Nordstrom below which will lend you that high fashion finish in an instant.

The two actors reprised their famous roles as they strutted down the catwalk to announce Zoolander 2, the highly-anticipated sequel to their hit 2001 film.  

During Ben's walk down the runway, he hijacked Jerome's cell phone while the vlogger was filming the runway and used it to take his own video selfie.

Jerome shared the video on Twitter, writing: 'Dereck Zoolander Took My Phone!'

Jerome has also snapped selfies with Harry Stylies and Christopher Walken among others.
