Alex Hales wants to show he deserves a place at the top table by forming a 50-over opening partnership with Alastair Cook that can prove England’s captain and their one-day cricket are not stuck in the dark ages.

Hales is aiming to emulate Australia’s David Warner and complete the journey from Twenty20 specialist to Test opener but first he is tasked with providing the power in England’s one-day cricket they are accused of sorely lacking.

The Notts batsman faces India in the third one-day international at his home Trent Bridge ground as the flag carrier for the breed of modern big-hitting batsman that are still all too often treated with suspicion by England.

Power play: Alex Hales, in the Trent Bridge nets, is relishing life at the top of the order for England

Criticism of England’s approach to the 50-over game and Cook’s role in it from Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan this week coupled with an abject performance in Cardiff means the pressure is once again back on the skipper.

Hales, whose form has been transformed since he was sent out on loan to Worcestershire at the start of this season in order to get a game, is adamant he is the man to lift that pressure now he has finally been given his 50-over chance.

‘This is a dream come true,’ said Hales of his England 50-over elevation after enduring a torrid 2013. ‘And making my debut now is all the better after how last year went in first-class cricket. I’ve had to work really hard to show people I can be more than just a Twenty20 slogger and I’m really happy this opportunity has come along, even more so because I’ll be in front of my home crowd.’

His style, which is more orthodox than he is often given credit for, has the potential to complement that of Cook, who silenced those who questioned his one-day credentials three years ago by scoring four hundreds and six half centuries in his first 19 innings as 50-over captain. 

Now the man who has led England to more one-day victories than any other captain has to do so again.

Kicking on: Hales gives the ball a boot as he prepares to smash India around on his home ground

England (probable): Cook (capt), Hales, Bell, Root, Morgan, Buttler (wkt), Stokes, Woakes, Tredwell, Finn, Anderson.

India (probable): Dhawan, Samson, Kohli, Rahane, Raina, Dhoni (capt/wkt), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Shami, M Sharma.

Start: 10.30am, Trent Bridge. 

Umpires: Paul Reiffel (Aus) and Michael Gough (Eng).

Swann on Friday repeated his view first expressed on radio that Cook should stand down from the one-day captaincy in his column in The Sun and said: ‘I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn’t need the job. 

'The 50-over cricket England are playing is outdated and I feel it will be a painful winter. This is not a witch-hunt but I don’t want Cooky to be part of it.’

Hales, until this season a county colleague of Swann, defended his captain. ‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion but the guys in the dressing room are a hundred per cent behind Alastair and if you look at his record in one-day cricket it’s a pretty good one,’ said Hales. ‘All the guys are backing him to lead from the front as we look to bounce back in this series.’

Running the show: Moeen Ali and Hales seem to be enjoying the sprint training

Much of what Swann and Vaughan said in a BBC Test Match Special wet weather debate was valid but it also should be said that it is surely far too simplistic to believe England could throw James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy into the team as well as Hales and expect them all to swim rather than sink.

Taylor in particular has cause to feel hard done by, as does Ravi Bopara whose omission from this squad remains mystifying, but there remains good reasons why Cook, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were named to face India while England have not been helped by the fact that their key one-day batsman in Eoin Morgan has looked out of sorts.

They have three more chances against an India side who will be without the injured Rohit Sharma for the rest of the series to prove the selectors right while Roy will be given his chance in the Twenty20 international that follows.

If Hales, the most technically adept of the next generation, can build on his debut score of 40 in Wales which stood out in a lamentable England performance he has every chance of putting pressure on Sam Robson ahead of England’s next Test assignment in the Caribbean in April.

‘Test cricket is definitely in the back of my head,’ said Hales. ‘It always has been, even after the terrible time I had last year. It’s always been my dream to play Test cricket and that’s going to come with a lot more hard work.

‘There are people around the world who have shown what can be done. David Warner, Chris Gayle and Virender Sehwag, those guys are attacking opening batsmen. But it will take a lot of technical work and that’s up to me.’

A big performance in a series levelling win would be a start.
