But during her high school's pep rally, where she usually takes center stage to dance with the mascot, the junior was asked to her first ever prom in an unforgettable moment that left her in tears.

The 19-year-old, who was born with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome which causes abnormal growth to parts of the body,  said the proposal was a dream come true and that she looks forward to the memories.

Autumn Pollard, a student in Arkansas, was not expecting a grand proposal from star football player, Cope Robinson, in front of her entire school this week

During her high school's pep rally, where she usually takes center stage to dance with the mascot, the junior was asked to her first ever prom in an unforgettable moment that left her in tears

Her disorder was confirmed by Harvard in 2004 and she is only 4ft tall and weighs 57lb, according to ABC News.

In the heart-warming moment captured on video, Autumn was dancing in front of her classmates in the gymnasium filled with Corning High School students.

The mascot turned her around and she was surprised by a group of fellow students holding signs that spelled out the word 'prom' - with an arrow pointing to Cope Robinson, who had purple flowers in his hand, according to KAIT.

With purple flowers in hand, the sophomore knelt down and asked Autumn to prom

Surprised by the proposal, Autumn said yes as her eyes filled with tears and she hugged Cope. She said she is excited for the memories

As the sophomore knelt down on one knee with everyone in the room shouting Autumn's name, he asked her to prom, and the surprised, teary-eyed teen said yes.

Cope, 16, said he knew she wanted to go to the prom with him as they attend the same church. 

He said: 'Me, my sister Kandra Leonard and friend Marry-Ann Grubb set it up to go down at our last pep rally.

'The best part was seeing how happy she was. I'm looking forward to giving her the best prom possible.' 

In an emotional moment, Autumn is embraced by friends and family after the exciting ordeal

Her mother said she was not expecting the proposal to prom to happen and that she cried once it did

As she looks forward to April 18, the date of the prom, she said she is looking forward to spending time with her date

Autumn's mother, Suzanne Pollard, who was present during the touching moment said she was not aware of what was taking place, and that once it happened they cried.

As the teen is excited for a fun night with Cope on April 18, Autumn said she is looking forward to shopping for a prom dress and spending time with her date.

Cope hopes that people will see the video of him asking her to prom and that it will inspire people to be kind to others.

Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is usually diagnosed at birth.

Some cases can go undiagnosed until a child gets older.

The three most common of the syndrome are unusual facial features, short stature and heart defects present at birth. 

It is mostly uncommon and there is an estimated 1 in 2,500 children who are born with it - the disorder affects both sexes and all ethnic groups. 

The severity of the features of the disorder range from mild to life-threatening.

Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that occurs when the normal instructions that are carried in certain genes are scrambled - meaning some of the body’s processes do not work as normal.

There currently is no cure for the treatment.
