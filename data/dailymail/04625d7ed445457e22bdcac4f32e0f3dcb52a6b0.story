New York state police now have the power to see whether New Yorkers are texting while driving - even if their phones are on their laps.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has launched a $1 million plan to prevent distracted driving,  including purchasing specially-modified Chevy Tahoes that sit higher than regular SUVs for the police department.

These modified cars enable police to look down through other vehicle's windows to discern whether a driver is using their phone while driving.

The cars are part of Governor Cuomo's war on distracted driving. In addition to the new cars, the state has enacted stricter punishments for those caught using their phone on the road.

Last week, Cuomo signed a law that raises the penalty for texting-and-driving to match those for reckless driving and speeding.

Distracted: Driving while using a mobile phone is now punishable by steep fines and demerit points

Anyone caught texting or browsing on their smart phones while driving will incur a first-time fine of between $50 and $150 and lose five points from their license.

Drive and ambition: Governor Cuomo has been pushing his anti-distracted-driving agenda since his first year in office in 2011

Second-time offenders who are caught using a phone on the road will be fined up to $200, and thereafter could pay up to $400.

'Distracted driving has become a frightening epidemic on our roadways, and fines are an important tool to punish and prevent this reckless behavior,' Cuomo said in a news release. 

'Combined with stronger penalties on your license and increased 
enforcement, these increased fines will send a tough message to all 
drivers that distracted driving is a serious problem with serious 
consequences.'

Cuomo's crackdown on distracted driving isn't just a professional quest - it's personal.

The Governor has three children at home, two of whom are teenagers new to the roads.

'This is very real. I’m living this. I have two 18-year-olds who are driving,' Cuomo told ABC News.

New York state figures show that one in five accidents are caused by distracted driving.

According
to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, a texting driver is 23 
times more likely to crash than a driver who isn't using their phone.
