Pope Francis begged the world yesterday to back his New Year wish – for no more war.

Tens of thousands of people in St Peter’s Square in Rome saw his first appearance of the year at the Vatican window, where he expressed ‘the wish that there will never be more wars’.

He said: ‘Peace is always possible. We must search for it.’ And he said he agreed with a sign in the crowd that read: ‘Prayer is at the root of peace.’

Earlier, celebrating his first Mass of 2015 in St Peter’s Basilica, he urged people of all religions and cultures to fight modern slavery and human trafficking, saying everyone had a right to be free.

He said: ‘Each, according to his or her own responsibilities, is called to combat modern forms of enslavement.

‘From every people, culture and religion, let us join our forces.’

The service marked the Catholic Church’s World Day of Peace.

This year’s theme is: ‘No longer slaves, but brothers and sisters.'

Last month Francis appealed to consumers to shun low-cost goods that may be the product of forced labour or other forms of exploitation.

That message was sent to heads of state and governments, international institutions and parishes throughout the 1.2 billion-member Church.

The Argentine pope has made defence of migrants and workers a central issue of his papacy.

At a Vespers service on New Year's Eve, he condemned administrators and criminals in Rome accused of pocketing public funds meant to help poor migrants, urging a "spiritual and moral renewal".

The second global slavery index released in November by the Walk Free Foundation, an Australian-based human rights group, estimated that almost 36 million people were living as slaves, trafficked into brothels, forced into manual labour, victims of debt bondage or born into servitude.
