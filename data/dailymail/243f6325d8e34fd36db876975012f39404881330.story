David Wilkie, the former Olympic champion acknowledged as Scotland’s greatest swimmer, was furious at missing out on presenting the Commonwealth Games medals for the event which made him famous.

Wilkie, who triumphed in the 200metres breaststroke at Montreal 1976, was due to conduct the ceremony after Michael Jamieson was beaten by Scottish compatriot Ross Murdoch in Glasgow.

But Wilkie, the first swimmer to wear a cap and goggles in competition and now a successful businessman, wanted to change into a suit before handing over the gongs.

Like clockwork: David Wilkie won Olympic gold in the 200m breaststroke in Montreal in a world record time

On
 his return, an angry Wilkie found Louise Martin, honorary secretary of 
the Commonwealth Games Federation and chair of sportscotland, was doing
 the presentation instead.

Wilkie made his upset clear but repaired relations enough to hand out the medals after the 100m breaststroke final the following night, with England’s Adam Peaty taking gold.

Glasgow
 hotels may have upped their rates out of all proportion with the 
standing of the Commonwealth Games in the sporting calendar, but at 
least the event’s top officials don’t have the same delusions.

Games 
chief Prince Imran, from Malaysia, is happy to be ferried 
between the venues in a homely Ford C-Max. It’s not the kind of VIP 
courtesy car from which you would ever see football’s Sepp Blatter or 
cricket’s Giles Clarke emerge.

FA
 chairman Greg Dyke made a hard-hitting speech at a supporters’ forum 
over the weekend in which he described the FA Council as ‘overwhelmingly
 male, overwhelmingly white and increasingly irrelevant’.

Dyke intends 
to make wholesale governance reforms, with every councillor undertaking 
equality training.

Hard-hitting speech: FA chairman Greg Dyke was brutal about the FA Council

In light of
 Dyke’s comments, it is even more extraordinary that the FA have allowed
 referees’ chief David Elleray to escape after making a ghastly racist 
comment about an FA employee.And it’s not just Sports Agenda that 
regards the situation as a scandal.

So do many of those overwhelmingly 
white male councillors, who said as much at last week’s FA Council.

The
 Commonwealth Games rugby sevens has attracted more than 40,000 fans to 
Ibrox on successive days, demonstrating the popularity of an event that 
makes its Olympic debut at Rio 2016.

But Brazil don’t get the sport, 
judging by the decision to stage it in a temporary arena with a capacity
 of just 20,000.

Tom flies into trouble 

There
 is disappointment within British  Swimming that diver Tom Daley had 
Hollywood scriptwriter boyfriend Dustin Lance Black with him on the 
flight from Shanghai that had to make a frightening emergency landing in
 Russia.

The British divers 
were returning from a World Cup in China and the sport’s authorities 
take the view they should have flown as a team rather than having 
partners or parents in tow.

There
 is also concern Black will turn Daley’s head towards Los Angeles, with 
the Olympic bronze medallist having to deny claims he will quit diving 
before Rio 2016.

Disappointment: Tom Daley missed out on a medal by 34 points, finishing fourth in Shanghai

Alex Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, has promised not to turn Glasgow 
2014 into a Referendum circus ahead of the September 18 vote.

But 
Salmond has made it clear in track and field circles that if Scotland 
vote Yes, he would like them to send an independent team to Rio 2016, 
which would cause considerable problems for Team GB.

However, the IOC 
granting Scotland single-country status might not be as straightforward 
as Salmond thinks. 

Breakaway group: Alex Salmond wants to take a Scotland team to Rio if the population vote for independence

Bill 
Sweeney, chief executive of the British Olympic Association, not only 
watched godson Ben Proud win gold in the 50m butterfly but also ensured 
the swimmer’s parents were able to watch the semi-finals. They had no 
tickets for the race until Sweeney intervened.

The demise of British cycling since London 2012 suggests UK Sport’s 
ambition of winning more medals in more events in Brazil than they did 
in London is highly optimistic. It would have been more realistic to 
target beating the Beijing haul.
