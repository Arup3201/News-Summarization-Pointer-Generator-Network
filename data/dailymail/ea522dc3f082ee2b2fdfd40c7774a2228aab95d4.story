Forbes magazine reported that the  former sugarcane plantation, featuring 2,500 feet of oceanfront and a working organic farm, has been off-and-on-the market for a few years. 

It is thought that Zuckerberg, 30, has paid around $66 million for the Kahu'aina Plantation and $49.6 million for Pila'a Beach, according to Pacific Business News.

The Pila'a Beach property consists of five separate parcels, each which could be developed into private homes. Further homes could also be built on the Kahu'aina Plantation.

But sources told Forbes that the billionaire intends to build just one secluded property.

Zuckerberg purchased Pila’a Beach from Pflueger Properties, a Hawaii limited partnership belonging to Jim Pflueger, a retired local Honda dealer.

Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, are donating $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Foundation to help address the Ebola epidemic.

The money will be used by the Ebola response effort in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and elsewhere in the world where Ebola is a threat.

The grant will come from their fund at the nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

It follows a $9 million donation made by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen last month.

The famously private entrepreneur will have one neighbor, however. 

Denver executive Gary Stewart of oil and gas company Melange International, who purchased the remaining 10.8 per cent interest in the Pila’a Beach property for $6.04 million.

Sources told Forbes that the billionaire tried to buy Stewart out, but he was not interested in the offer.

When asked about his latest reported acquisition a Facebook spokesman told the magazine: 'We don't comment on rumors and speculation, but thank you for reaching out!'

Facebook's co-founder has long been a fan of Hawaii and has made a number of trips to the islands with his wife Priscilla Chan. The no-frills trips had sparked rumors that the couple were on the look out for real estate on the islands.

Last year, the couple were spotted enjoying a burger from world famous Bubba Burgers at Kauai’s North Shore, and surfing on the island of Maui.
