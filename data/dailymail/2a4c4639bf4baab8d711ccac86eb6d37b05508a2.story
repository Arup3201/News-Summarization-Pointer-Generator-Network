You might view your weekly commute as nothing more than a routine part of your day, but new research suggests it is actually fraught with danger.

The study has revealed that Britons typically risk serious injury 32 times during their weekly commute and 1.7 million have had to take time off work after getting hurt.

Accidents most commonly occur due to crossing roads without looking properly, running down escalators and eating on the move.

Other hazards include jumping 
onto a bus or train as the doors close, which 40 per cent of commuters admit 
to doing - and nipping into the road to overtake slow walkers, 
which 39 per cent do.

Commuters also confess to waiting in the middle of the road for traffic to clear and 35 per cent say they duck and weave through crowds.

The average commuter takes more than 1,600 risks which could result in serious injury a year, the report reveals.

Train commuters are most at risk at 8.29am because this is when major stations are at their busiest.

Women take more risks commuting than men - 35 per week - and workers in Manchester top the list of biggest risk takers – they take 48 risks per week, according to the research by insurance company LV.

Mark Jones, of the insurer LV, which carried out the research, said: ‘The average urban British commuter taking so many risks, and so frequently, is concerning.

‘Everyone knows freak accidents can happen, but here we're talking about hazards that can be avoided.

‘It's about slowing down and being more mindful, and thinking more carefully about the consequences of our actions.‘Physical wellbeing is important to everyone, but an accident can also have serious consequences on people's finances.

‘Whether you're single or have a family, are renting or own your property, if you are no longer able to work and earn an income each month many people would struggle to make ends meet for long.’

Statistics show that people who have an accident crossing the road without looking are laid up for an average of 3.5 months.

Those who are injured standing over the yellow line at a train platform tend to be off sick for 3.4 months, and people who slip when rushing through crowds, for 3.2 months.

LV ran a social experiment, the 'Everyday Life Hazard Perception Test', and put 100 urban commuters through a mock commute showing the 11 most common risks.

They had to click on the screen whenever they spotted a potential hazard in the interactive film - and only four passed.
