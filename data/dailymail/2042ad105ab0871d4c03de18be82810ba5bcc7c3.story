Manchester United signing Ander Herrera offered a display full of promise in his side’s 7-0 evisceration of LA Galaxy on Wednesday and the statistics reveal that the Spaniard is sure to provide an upgrade on the midfielders that toiled with such difficulty under David Moyes last season.

In the dominant victory in Louis van Gaal’s first match in charge of the club in Los Angeles, Herrera earned the man-of-the-match award after a performance of poise and creativity in the United midfield, linking up almost telepathically with his compatriot Juan Mata.

Albeit against admittedly mediocre opposition, Herrera enjoyed an encouraging debut, creating three of United’s seven goals as he played the full 90 minutes.

Brilliant start: Ander Herrera appears to be the creative spark Manchester United sorely lacked last season

New star? Herrera can be an upgrade on United's midfielders, who struggled to provide assists last season

This was as many as any United midfielder managed in the Premier League throughout the whole of last season, with the exception of Juan Mata, who created four after signing for the club from Chelsea in the January transfer window.

Herrera’s three assists equalled the tallies of Antonio Valencia, Adnan Januzaj and Shinji Kagawa from the duration of United’s traumatic Premier League season, with the club slumping to 7th position.

Herrera, in one match, also dwarfed the single assists registered by under-performers such as Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young while players including Nani, Darren Fletcher, Anderson, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick all failed to create a goal for a team-mate in the 2013/14 campaign.

United will hope that the £28.4m Herrera will go some way to correcting the creativity deficit that has seemed to be behind so much of United’s toil in recent times.
