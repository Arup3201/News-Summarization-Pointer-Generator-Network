The actor, singer and TV personality, whose real name is Chris Hardman, died on Monday in his home town of Lowestoft.

The news comes just months before the young star was preparing to launch a pop comeback. Police have said his death is not being treated as suspicious.

Lil Chris, whose name is Chris Hardman, who made his name on Channel 4's Rock School, has died aged 24

Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who propelled Chris to fame on Rock School after making him the lead singer of a student band, also tweeted: 'Sad to report Lil Chris from the Gene Simmons Rock School TV show, has passed on. He was loved. RIP, Lil Chris.'

He later told Mirror Online: 'Lil Chris was a kind, little soul. I will greatly miss his smile and his spirit. I knew there was something special about him as soon as I met him.'

After becoming the show's breakout star, Chris was offered a solo deal, going on to release his best-known hit, Checkin' It Out, in 2006.

The song, later used in Asda's George clothing campaigns, debuted at number 13 in the UK Single Chart, and shot to Number 3 the following week. 

The news of his death comes four months before he was due to release a comeback album, having not released one since 2008's What's It All About. 

In December he wrote on Twitter: 'I'm planning to come back again! Hopefully this time for a little longer! Keep sticking around for updates. (sic)' 

But earlier this month, the musician told his followers that he was considering giving up his career as a singer.

He wrote: 'Thinking about quitting music forever...there has to come a time eventually when I have to face reality. I'm just not good enough. (sic)' 

The star has previously been vocal about suffering with depression, mentioning the illness in two separate tweets last year.

He tweeted: 'I hope to one day create a way out of depression that doesn't mean taking your own life. The Cure.'

Chris had previously been vocal about suffering with depression, posting this tweet in April last year

And in another message he wrote: 'Depression really sucks. Learning how to notice it can save lives and your own feelings at times. Take time to understand it, for everybody.'

His last tweet, on Wednesday March 18, read: 'Good morning everybody! Lovely day! Love you all x.'   

Today, Chris's Loserville director, Elliot Davis, told WhatsOnStage that his early fame could have triggered the illness. 

'He was a super talented guy, so naturally gifted. He just had something that the nation saw and it catapulted him to early fame, which perhaps caused problems,' he said.  

Allan Dodgeon, who managed Chris for a year from 2013, added that he was in 'complete shock'.

He said: 'He was an outstanding talent and it was a pleasure to work with him. Our thoughts are with his friends and family.'

Chris went on to host his own talk show, Everybody Loves Lil' Chris on Channel 4, and interviewed several famous faces 

Chris first appeared on the second series of reality TV show Rock School when he was 15. In the show, which was filmed at Kirkley High School in Lowestoft, Gene Simmons prepared classically trained young students to be rock stars.

Chris was selected as the frontman of the band Hoax UK.

Later, in 2006, the young singer released his debut album after signing a deal with RCA, triggering a huge fun base, mainly of teenager girls.

He then went on to host his own talk show, Everybody Loves Lil' Chris on Channel 4, on which he interviewed a number of celebrities and hosted live music performances. The show was also made up of 'challenges' which the guests carried out on screen.
