Even the most photogenic dogs need a little help to get the perfect picture.

Now one canine-obsessed group has created an app that it claims will get lively pups to strike a Facebook-worthy pose.

New York-based Bark&Co created the free Barcam app to help get a dog’s attention before a photo is taken.

Instagram may be filled with animal photos, but now a new breed of 'social petworks' is taking pet photography to a new level .

For instance, YummyPets launched in the UK last year after proving popular in France.

YummyPets closely resembles Facebook, and as well as letting owners post photos and updates for their pets, the site helps put them in touch with useful and local pet services. It can also be used to find missing pets, and features an instant messaging service.

Elsewhere, MySocialPetwork looks like a Pinterest for pets. Grids of animals photos are organised by tags, and photos can be liked.

Users begin by choosing from a range of sounds to peak their pet’s interest, including cat meows, squeak toys, doorbells and a bag of treats rustling.

The sound is triggered by tapping the shutter, hopefully getting the dog to deliver its best expression before the photo is taken.

Reviews seem to agree that the sounds make pups look straight into the frame. 

Social petwork: BarkCam also has its own built-in social network to share doggy photos. Images can also be shared on one of the increasing number of ‘social petworks’, such as Klooff or Yummypets

BarkCam is available in Apple's App Store, and an Android app is planned for August

‘The cool noises the camera makes right before taking the pic makes my dog do the cutest and funniest faces,’ one review said. 

Once the photo is taken, users can add text, filters and stickers, or share it on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

If that’s not enough, BarkCam has its own built-in social network to share doggy photos.

Images can also be shared on one of the increasing number of ‘social petworks’, such as Klooff or Yummypets.

Like Facebook, these social petworks lets owners create profiles for their animals, with details of the pet’s breed, age and even interests.

BarkCam is available in Apple's App Store, and an Android app is planned for August.
