Relatives of passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have demanded officials retract an announcement that everyone on board is dead.

Chinese relatives of passengers found no solace in yesterday's verdict, which officially declared the flight's disappearance an accident with all on board presumed dead, clearing the way for families to be awarded compensation. 

Today, about 100 Chinese families demanded officials retract the statement, as they do not want to start compensation claims without hard evidence.

Chinese relatives of passengers who were on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 said they believe they are alive. Pictured, a relative cries during a gathering with other family members in Beijing today

Policemen were pictured moving in to stop family members giving an interview to the media, during a gathering to pray for the safe return of the passengers, in front of the Yonghegong Lama Temple, Beijing

But as they gathered to pray for the safe return of their family members at the the Yonghegong Lama Temple in Beijing, they were pictured being prevented by policemen from giving interviews.  

The Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on March 8 last year, carrying 239 passengers and crew shortly after taking off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing.

So far, investigators have failed to find any trace of the aircraft and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has now ruled that the disappearance accidental.  

'We don't accept it,' said Zhang Qian, whose husband was on the plane. 'As a matter of fact, we are demanding the statement to be retracted.' 

She added: 'I feel like I am giving it all up if we start talking about compensation.

'We don't need compensation, and we would be more than glad not to ask for a dime if my husband comes back to me.'

About 100 Chinese families demanded officials retract the statement as they gathered at the Yonghegong Lama temple in Beijing

Earlier this week, in anticipation of the Malaysian statement, 110 members in a group of 115 relatives of passengers voted to demand that Malaysian officials refrain from making any announcement.

Jiang Hui, whose mother was a passenger aboard the flight, said the new announcement was based on no new facts.

He said: 'We not only demand the Malaysian government retract the statement, but also issue an apology.

'That's the wish of the majority of family members.' 

Therese Rando, a clinical psychologist who has worked extensively in grief counseling, said the relatives' continued refusal to accept the conclusion is understandable because they are going through an 'ambiguous loss', where there has been no body or wreckage to confirm death.

She told the Associated Press: 'For any family member to make the move to presume death in the absence of confirmation is a huge step.

'They need to have eliminated other possibilities; to do otherwise would be tantamount to prematurely abandoning their loved one.' 

Captain Mior Nor Badrishah, of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, revealed the undersea search is a third complete and authorities are confident of finding the aircraft soon

Their calls came as today, officials revealed they are confident of finding the aircraft soon.

Officials said today that the undersea search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has covered almost a third of its target area.

They added that they were confident the aircraft is in the zone - after months of searches have failed to turn up any trace. 

Malaysia, along with China and Australia, has been searching for the plane in the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Perth, Australia. 

Mior Nor Badrishah Mohamad, an official of Malaysia's civil aviation department, told a press conference that 31.04% of the search area had been covered.

He said: 'Based on the available data, this is the place'.

Authorities reiterated that they expect the undersea search of an area of 60,000 square km (23,000 square miles) to be completed by May.

Mr Mohamad added: 'If we cannot find MH370 within this area, we need to sit down again and decide what's the best way forward, based on the data we have'.

He said poor weather after May would make the search more difficult.  

Yesterday, DCA director-general Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said: 'We officially declare Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 an
accident... and that all 239 of the passengers and crew onboard
MH370 are presumed to have lost their lives. 

The announcement is in accordance with standards of annexes
12 and 13 in the International Civil Aviation, said Azharuddin. 

It will allow families of the passengers to obtain assistance
through compensation, he added.

Malaysian authorities are confident they are close to finding missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 as Chinese relatives of passengers said they believe they are alive 

Despite months of searches, investigators have failed to find any trace of the aircraft and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has now ruled that the disappearance accidental

Malaysia Airlines is ready to proceed immediately with compensation to next-of-kin of passengers on the
flight, he said.

International investigators are still looking into why the jet veered thousands of miles off course from its scheduled
route before eventually plunging into the Indian Ocean. Malaysia is also conducting a criminal investigation.

'Both investigations are limited by the lack of physical
evidence at this time, particularly the flight recorders,' said
Azharuddin.

'Therefore, at this juncture, there is no evidence to
substantiate any speculations as to the cause of the accident.'

The DCA plans to release an interim report on the
investigation into the missing jetliner on March 7, a day before
the first anniversary of the disappearance.

'This declaration is by no means the end,' said Azharuddin,
adding that it will continue with the search for the missing
plane with assistance from China and Australia.

Malaysia airline's crisis deepened on July 17 when Flight MH17, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was
shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.
