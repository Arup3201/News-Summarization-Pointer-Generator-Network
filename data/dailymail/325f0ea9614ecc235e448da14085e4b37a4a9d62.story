Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the relationship between Ukraine and Russia has been a complicated one.

Divided by political and civil unrest, Ukraine has become a pawn in a power game played by Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Its citizens comprise those loyal to Russia and those who want Ukraine to remain an independent country to Russian rule.

Revolution: internal strife in Ukraine led to an uprising in February (pictured) when the Ukrainian Parliament deposed President Viktor Yanukovych and installed a pro-Western interim leader in what Russian president Vladimir Putin has criticised as a coup d'etat

Mired in unrest: Ukraine lies between Europe and Russia and despite its being the world's third largest grain producer the country has been debt-ridden and suffered a series of political uprisings and unrest in a power game between Russia and the west

Ukraine lies in a strategic position between Russia and Europe and has vital ports on the Black Sea in its troubled autonomous region, the Crimean Peninsula

Mired by years of corruption, mismanagement and a lack of economic growth, businesswoman and local political hero Yulia Tymoshenko, led a protest movement throughout the 2000s.

In November 2013, in an attempt to appease the population's rising impatience with a poor standard of living and inadequate health care system, president Victor Yanukovych faced two options - sign off on a deal with the EU which would see Tymoshenko released from prison, or take a $15 billion loan from Russia.

Yanukovych chose to sign the treaty with Russia, enraging sections of the population.

Violent clashes between protestors and riot police ensued in Kiev, which escalated into a revolution as hundreds of protestors marched on the city centre demanding the deposing of President Yanukovych by the Ukrainian parliament, and on February 21, Yanuokovych fled Kiev for Russia. 

The new government of Oleksandr Turchynov was recognised by the United States and European Union, but condemned by Russia as illegitimate.

Russia then accused the United States and the EU of funding and directing the Ukrainian revolution. Fresh elections for Ukraine were due in May 25, but Russia called for them to be postponed.

Meanwhile, an international crisis involving Russia and Ukraine broke out over the control of the Crimean Peninsula, a province of Ukraine which lies on the Black Sea with strategic ports.

On February 26, local self-defence forces began to take control of the Crimean peninsula.

Sources reported that military personnel in Russian-made uniform without insignia, and former members of the Ukraine military were involved.

Most of Crimea’s two million inhabitants speak Russian and describe themselves as Russian, and even though they hold Ukrainian passports they live in an autonomous region with its own constitution and parliament.

However, there is also a percentage of revolutionary dissidents who hate Russia, called the Crimean Tartars, who feared Russian president Vladimir Putin would encourage the Ukrainian separatist movement for his own political benefit and intervene militarily in Crimea.

Russian arms and munitions have allegedly been sent in support to separatists in Donetsk, Ukraine, where pro-Russia rebels have now claimed responsibility for having shot down a military transport plane on July 17.

The so-called Donetsk People's Republic is a self-proclaimed, unrecognized state in eastern Ukraine which shares a border with Russia.

The Ukrainian administration has described it as a terrorist organisation.

Reports say Russian-backed Donetsk separatist leader Igor Girkin, who also goes by the name of Strelkov, has claimed responsibility for ordering the missile attack on Malaysian flight MH17, perhaps thinking it was a Ukrainian military aircraft.
