Getting a parking fine is a bad experience at the best of times. But getting one you haven't earned - that's even worse.

This was the reality for Brisbane woman Julie Small last week, when she paid a visit to her local shopping mall during her work lunch break.

However, what she didn't realise at the time was that the dashboard camera (dashcam) installed in her car would help her case against the parking company that tried to rip her off.

Julie Small received an $88 parking fine last week even though she had a valid ticket in her car

Speaking to A Current Affair Ms Small revealed her outrage when she returned to her car at Market Plaza Shopping Centre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, to find a parking fine on her windscreen - despite being back before the two hour limit.

'To do this sort of thing to unwitting people, I just think it's criminal,' she told the program.

Footage from Ms Small's dashcam shows her switching off the engine just before 12 o'clock last Friday, at which point she put the paid two hour ticket in her car and went about her business.

But, the $88 fine she received was time-stamped at 12.39 - well before she was due to return around 2pm. When she brought this up with an employee at a nearby office, Ms Small didn't get the reaction she was hoping for.

'I went over to the employee who works for the company and I asked her could she explain why I got fined when I had an unexpired ticket.

'She told me that I had an expired ticket - she couldn't care less. She just stood there and blatantly lied to me,' Ms Small revealed.

 The ticket was issued just 40 minutes after she left her car, despite her having paid the full far for two hours

Luckily for her the parking company have since dropped the fine, but the savvy driver expressed her dismay over the fact that other motorists may have been caught out by the same tricks.

'I'm just glad that I have the evidence and I'm really sorry for the people who have been caught and had no evidence,' she said.

'(It's) definitely revenue raising, I mean there's other ways that you could police a carpark,' Ms Small continued.
