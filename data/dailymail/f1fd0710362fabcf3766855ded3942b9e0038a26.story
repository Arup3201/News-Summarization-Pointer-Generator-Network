When a German bomber crashed in a field on May 10, 1941, the women of Earlswood were quick  to mobilise.

Seizing pitchforks, brooms and scissors, they marched two miles across the countryside towards the wreckage – and wounded wireless operator, Rudolph Budde, who ran off in fear as they approached.

But they didn’t want revenge. They wanted his silk parachute.

The
womenfolk of Earlswood just before the war. They watched the Luftwaffe 
crash near their hamlet on May 10, 1941, and set off with pitchforks to 
relieve the stunned airman of his parachute in order to make knickers

Budde, pictured left and right, was found lying in a 
ditch. He fled at the sight of the armed women and was rounded up 
days later by the Home Guard

formation that attacked Birmingham. It was tasked with bombing a 
factory at Longbridge where Lancaster bombers were being made

The canopy provided enough material 
to make bloomers for every woman in the village who wanted a pair at a 
time when new clothes were an all-but forgotten luxury, and silk a rare 
commodity.

Private Budde was captured the 
following day by the Home Guard and treated for burns at a hospital near
the village, in Warwickshire. He was then held as a prisoner of war.

The remarkable story came to light 
thanks to Christine Thorp, who took an off-cut of the parachute to the 
BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.  Her mother, Irene Gill – at the time Irene 
Smith – was one of the women involved in the intrepid silk raid.

Mrs Thorp, 72, said: ‘My mother died 
two years ago aged 95 but a few years before she gave me the piece of 
the parachute as she  knew I was interested in the  story behind it.

‘She told me the villagers had seen 
this German bomber come down a couple of miles away and  a handful of 
them – mainly women as the men were away at war or working on the farms –
got together and decided to retrieve  a parachute.

The bomber was supposed to follow the Birmingham to Bristol railway line for Longbridge but chose the wrong tracks and headed towards Redditch. It was shot down by the AA battery (pictured) when it passed RAF Wythall

‘They picked up whatever weapons they
could lay their hands on like pitchforks and brooms for their own 
protection and walked two miles across the fields.

‘When they got there and found the 
airman, he was more scared of them. She said he must have thought he was
going to be killed and ran off into the woods. They found his parachute
and cut it up among themselves using the scissors. It was pure silk, 
very soft and fine material.

‘Women who were married during the 
war often had to make their own wedding dresses out of a variety of 
materials. They were quite resourceful.

‘All the ladies in the village who wanted some silk got some but others would not touch it because it was German.

‘Mother did make some underwear out 
of her cut but she also got a piece that had some German printing on. It
was unusable but she decided to keep it.

‘I have had it for about 20 years and have washed and ironed it and now keep it in a plastic cover in my wardrobe.’

Private Budde’s Heinkel HE-III bomber was part of a large formation that attacked Birmingham on the night of May 10, 1941.

His plane was supposed to break off 
from the main group to bomb a factory at Longbridge, where Lancaster 
bombers were being made.

The four-man crew were meant to follow the Birmingham to Bristol railway line as a navigating aid but chose the wrong tracks.

The plane ended up going towards 
Redditch and was shot by anti-aircraft fire when it flew over RAF 
Wythall. It crashed in a field near Earlswood.

winner, and observer Feldwebel Fritz Mohn were killed and are buried at Cannock Chase

The pilot, Senior Lieutenant Johannes
Speck von Steinberg, flight engineer Sergeant Siegfried Ruhle, who had 
been awarded the Iron Cross, and Sergeant Fritz Mohn were killed 
outright.

The Earlswood Village Museum still 
holds part of the wreckage of the Heinkel. It also has Sergeant Ruhle’s 
Iron Cross, which was found in the field weeks later.

Private Budde was repatriated  to Germany after the war. He died in 2003.
