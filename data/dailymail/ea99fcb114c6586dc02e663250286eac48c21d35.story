Enough is enough, Wenger out, read one banner at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

The poster was unfurled in the moments after Wayne Rooney had given Manchester United a 2-0 lead.

It wasn’t big, probably the size of an A4 sheet of paper. Its message, however, was significant.

Some Arsenal fans vented their frustration at Arsene Wenger holding aloft the banner 'Enough is enough, Wenger out' during the game against Manchester Untied on Saturday

The disgruntled fan immediately had the sign confiscated by a steward, so as not to incite angry exchanges with those who remain pro-Wenger.

The Frenchman’s job, despite their desperate start to the season, is safe. The only way Arsene Wenger leaves Arsenal is if he walks. Like it or not, Arsenal fans have at least another two-and-a-half years of him.

Manchester United have won 11 and drawn three of their last 15 matches against Arsenal.

But what can Wenger do to halt the gradual sea change in opinion of those who used to worship the ground he walked on?

Sorting out his side’s leaky defence would be a good starting point.

At the moment, Arsenal are susceptible to counter attacks; Wenger knows it. So, too, does Louis van Gaal.

When asked if he felt Arsenal were vulnerable to being caught on the break following Manchester United’s win at the Emirates, their Dutch manager replied: ‘That’s why I played this formation. Yes, it was a risk but I was sure Arsenal wanted to attack and to press us.

‘Then, you know that Arsenal is giving a lot of space away and then Per Mertesacker and Nacho Monreal have to defend. 

'That’s why I put Di Maria against Mertesacker and Van Persie against Monreal. That’s why I brought on Wilson for more pace.’

Van Gaal’s comments are likely to have Arsenal assistant manager Steve Bould clenching his fists in frustration. A rival manager pinpointing Arsenal’s defence as a weakness won’t sit well with the former Gunners centre half.

Injuries to key defenders Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy haven’t helped.Nor has the fact Wenger failed to replace Thomas Vermaelen, who left for Barcelona in the summer.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger brought on Olivier Giroud - his first appearance since August due to injury - but despite scoring the Frenchman couldn't prevent the Gunners falling to another defeat

But throwing men forward in search of goals has cost Arsenal in three consecutive games — two of which they were winning.

How can this team show such indiscipline with Bould’s wealth of defensive knowledge at their disposal?

Perhaps it’s time for Wenger to dilute his attacking principles and work on resolving the defensive deficiencies that are ruining their season. And who better than Bould, who made 372 appearances for Arsenal, to help right the current wrongs?
