The night before his February 4 breakout game against the New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks phenomenon Jeremy Lin found himself homeless. The sofa where he usually slept at his brother Joshua's Lower East Side New York City apartment was taken -- there was a party that night there.

So Lin shacked up at the modest White Planes, New York, home of teammate Landry Fields. And crashed on his coach, a simple brown sofa. The couch is now one of the most famous pieces of furniture in NBA history.

The next day, Lin, 23, captured the hearts of New Yorkers and the attention of basketball fans around the country with his explosive play -- a career-high 25 points, five rebounds and seven assists. He's gone from sitting on the bench to the Knicks' starting lineup as the team has gone on a five-game winning streak.

And it all began on this couch.

Famous couch: Jeremy Lin crashed here, at Landry Fields' apartment, before his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets

Breakout performance: Lin has become an overnight sensation for his explosive play on the court since the game against the New Jersey Nets last week

'Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only couch made famous by @JLin7! Let the bidding begin,' Fields tweeted Sunday afternoon.

Lin, a 6-foot-3 point guard who played for Harvard University, said the couch was 'decent, but not huge.'

After his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets, Lin told reporters about his accommodations the prior night: 'Thank you to Landry for hosting me. I think I might just move in with him,' he said.

Lin's precarious accommodations prompted real estate developer and attorney Edward Mermelstein to offer him free use of an apartment until he finds a more permanent place to settle.

Upscale: Carmelo Anthony recently sold his $12 million Denver mansion for a $6 million loss

High rolling: Carmelo Anthony, left, pictured with his wife LaLa, makes more than $18.5 million a year. Landry Fields and Jeremy Lin, right, live more humble lives, pulling in about $620,000 per year each

Lin's digs are a bit humble, compared to the multimillion-dollar digs that have become the norm for some of his teammates and the players he has beaten this month.

For example, fellow Knick Carmelo Anthony has a three year contract worth $65 million.

He's reportedly renting a condo in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood for $22,000 a month. He and his wife LaLa Vazquez bought a $2 million 6,500-square-foot home in Los Angeles with 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, an infinity edge pool and a cabana in the backyard.

But that's a pittance compared to the $12 million he spent in 2007 for aÂ sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion in Denver when he was playing for the Nuggets. He reportedly sold it for a loss of nearly $6 million when he moved to New York.

Luxury: Amare Stoudemire pays $37,000 a month for his condo at 99 Jane Steet

Star power: Amare Stoudemire is one of the highest-paid players on the Knicks, with an annual salary of more than $18 million

Knick's center Amare Stoudemire lives 
similarly large. He's reportedly renting a $37,000-a-month condo in New 
York's West Village, which offers 4,500 square feet inside and a 
4,500-square-foot patio.

He
also recently paid $3.7 million for a six bedroom, 
six-and-a-half-bathroom mansion in a gated community in Southwest 
Ranches, Florida.

Stoudemire will rake in $99.7 million over the life of his five-year contract with the Knicks.

None of that compares to Kobe Bryant, however, who makes more than $25 million a year.

That
salary didn't keep Lin, whose comparatively paltry salary is less than 
$620,000, and his Knicks from beating the Lakers 92-85 Friday night.

Of
course, Bryant might night a couch of his own to crash on soon. It was 
recently disclosed that his wife Vanessa will get all three of his Los 
Angeles-area mansions, including a newly-built $11.2 million estate, 
when the couple finalize their divorce.

Big money: Kobe Bryant is set to lose this $4.6 million Los Angeles-area mansion, and two other homes, in his divorce

$25 million: Kobe Bryant is the highest paid player in the NBA, but that didn't stop Jeremy Lin and the Knicks from beating his Lakers last week
