Cristiano Ronaldo's agent has revealed that Arsenal failed to sign the Portuguese forward because their move to the Emirates Stadium left them with no money.

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner eventually joined the Gunners' rivals Manchester United in 2003, but Jorge Mendes admitted that even he thought his client would end up playing for Arsene Wenger. 

'There was a moment in which I really thought he was going to Arsenal,' Mendes said in his new book, The Key to Mendes. 'David Dein is a spectacular person but, with the construction of their stadium, they were left with very little money and it wasn't possible.'

Ronaldo himself remembers the trip to Arsenal well. He said: 'We were travelling by car and Jorge was calling us constantly telling me to hide so no one would see me. 

'We went to a service station and I hid my face. I remember back then that Jorge was going crazy, those were Jorge's craziest days.'

Ronaldo scored 118 goals during his six years in Manchester, and Mendes insists the man responsible for his development there was also a key figure in bringing him to the club.  

He said: 'The only person key to everything was Alex Ferguson. He told me that Cristiano was going to play at least 50 per cent of the games for Manchester United and that's what I wanted to hear. 

'That's why Cristiano went to Manchester United.' 

When Wenger was asked about the proposed transfer in 2013, though, he recalled a slightly different version of events. 

The Frenchman admitted money had been an issue, but claimed there was another aspect to United's offer that the Gunners couldn't compete with. 

He said: 'What happened was that Carlos Queiroz went to Manchester United and they snapped him away from us because he knew him from Sporting.

'That's what life is about. You give your best but sometimes you might find that people are stronger than you. That can happen as well.'
