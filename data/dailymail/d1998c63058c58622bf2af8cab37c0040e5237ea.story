The letters are said to be ¿particularly frank¿ and contain the Prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs' on a wide array of political issues

Taxpayers face a legal bill of tens of thousands of pounds as ministers fight to keep secret details of Prince Charles’s political lobbying.

Senior judges yesterday ordered the release of ‘black spider’ letters written by the Prince of Wales to Labour ministers, overturning a ruling by the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve.

Mr Grieve, the government’s most senior legal officer, vetoed their release last year, saying it could undermine the Prince’s political neutrality and make it impossible for him to be King.

But following the judgment, Mr Grieve immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters.

They are said to be ‘particularly frank’ and contain the Prince’s ‘most deeply held personal views and beliefs’ on a wide array of political issues.

Last night campaigners called for the veil of secrecy over Royal correspondence with Government to be lifted and for all ‘lobbying’ letters to be made public.

A Clarence House spokesman refused to comment yesterday saying it was a ‘matter for the government’.

But senior royal sources indicated the Prince was unrepentant about the need for ‘privacy’.

A senior royal source told the Mail: ‘It’s important to place this in context. The Prince wrote the letters with the expectation of privacy and the government has since legislated to enshrine that privacy in law.’

Mr Grieve’s decision to appeal the ruling sets the stage for an extraordinary tussle in the country’s highest court between the Government and Rob Evans, a journalist from the Guardian newspaper, over personal correspondence from the future King.

The 27 letters were written to seven different government departments between September 2004 and April 2005. Letters from the Prince became known as ‘black spider’ memos because of his distinctive handwriting.

The targets included ministers at the business, culture, and environment ministries, the Northern Ireland and Cabinet Office and the health department.

They were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ in which the heir to the throne sought to influence policy .

Mr Evans asked to see the letters using the Freedom of Information Act but was refused by the Government.

Under the law at the time, there was a crucial test attached to Royal correspondence which could only be released if their publication was in the public interest.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters

In September 2012 a tribunal ruled that the letters should be released as they fell into the category of ‘advocacy correspondence’ in which Charles promoted his personal views or those of his charities.

The Government did not appeal the ruling, but one month later Mr Grieve brought a guillotine down on the release by using a ministerial veto.

In his ruling, he warned that it the release of the letters risked suggesting the Prince was party political because his letters include disagreements with government policy.

He wrote: ‘Any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future Monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the Throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is King.’

But The Guardian appealed the ruling, to the Court of Appeal, and yesterday the court quashed the Attorney’s ruling.

Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and two other appeal judges said he did not have ‘reasonable grounds’ for forming the opinion he did, and it was not justification enough for him to disagree with the tribunal’s ruling.

‘The mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the Upper Tribunal in weighing the competing interests involved was not enough.

‘He had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision of the Upper Tribunal reached after six days of hearing and argument.

‘He could point to no error of law or fact in the tribunal’s decision and the Government Departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it.’

The Government was also ordered to pay The Guardian’s costs of nearly £100,000.

In 2011 the Freedom of Information Act was changed so all Royal correspondence from the Sovereign, the first and second in lines to the throne was exempt from the law.

But Graham Smith, the spokesman for the campaign group Republic said: ‘It is now time the government gave up their fight and accepted the need for disclosure of Charles’s lobbying.’

‘Dominic Grieve’s argument is that it is better to pretend Charles is impartial than to prove he is not. Charles is required to stay out of politics, if he is lobbying politicians then the public have a right to know.’

‘Royals now have the complete freedom to lobby the government in secret and on whatever issue they choose.

‘The law must be now be changed to allow the public to know when and how Charles and other members of his family are lobbying our government.’

A spokesman for Mr Grieve said he would appeal ‘in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case’.

A Guardian News & Media spokesman said: ‘The public has a right to know if the heir to the throne is advocating policy or promoting causes to government ministers.

‘We welcome today’s appeal court judgement finding that it was wrong to block the release of the letters.

‘We hope the Attorney General will recognise he has reached the end of the legal road and that government departments will now publish the correspondence so that the public can judge for themselves.’
