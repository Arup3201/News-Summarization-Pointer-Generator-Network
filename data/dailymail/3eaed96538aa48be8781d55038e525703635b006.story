With parents like his, there was never any doubt Prince George was going to be a bonny baby. 

But perhaps he has his mother to thank for one of his most charming features. 

For looking at a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge as a baby, it’s clear he has inherited his adorable chubby cheeks from her.

Our family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showed off Prince George in the Mother's Day photograph

Just like mum: Looking at a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge as a baby in 1982 (right), it’s clear Prince George has inherited his adorable chubby cheeks from her. The Prince also shares his mother's snub nose

But George’s flick of fair hair on 
show in the latest Cambridge family portrait is undeniably the mark of 
his father, who was blond at a similar age.  

George is also said to have one bottom tooth popping through and has just learnt to crawl.

When it comes to dress sense, however, his grandfather – rather than his fashionable mother – is leaving his mark. 

It emerged yesterday that George’s blue jumper which bears his name was a gift from Prince Charles.

It is believed he had it created for his grandson in machine-made cashmere, favoured by Johnstons of Elgin, a family-run wool mill that holds the Royal Warrant for Prince Charles.

The
 portrait, released yesterday to mark Mother’s Day, was taken through a 
window of the Cambridges’ home, Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, by 
renowned photographer Jason Bell.

He was also commissioned to take the official photos of Prince George’s christening in October last year.

Just born: He is also said to have one bottom tooth popping through and seems besotted with family pet Lupo

In the latest photo eight-month-old George appears besotted with family pet Lupo, gazing affectionately at the spaniel.

Kate takes the job of holding George, as was the case in the official christening portrait, while William ensures Lupo behaves himself as he did in another photo of the family taken by the duchess’s father Michael Middleton. 

But perhaps the most striking aspect of this latest picture is Prince George’s resemblance to his mother.

Leaving his mark: It has emerged that George's blue jumper bearing his name was a gift from Prince Charles

A photo of Kate taken in 1982, the year she was born, reveals she had equally round cheeks and a similar snub nose.

Looking rather bemused, Kate was attending the first birthday party of Nicola Brown, her first best friend, with her mother Carole. 

The release of William and Kate’s portrait comes ahead of the couple’s three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia next week.

The duke and duchess are said to be looking forward to it immensely, particularly because they are taking Prince George with them. 

The couple have planned the trip so that they are able to return to George every night, apart from on two evenings.

Their new Spanish Norland-trained nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is also travelling with them to share childcare duties.

Happy couple: The release of William and Kate's portrait comes ahead of the couple's three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia. They said to be looking forward to it - particularly as they are taking their son with them

While the Queen was forced to leave her two young children – Charles and Anne – at home when she undertook a six-month Commonwealth tour in 1953, William has told friends that leaving George behind was ‘unthinkable’.

William and Kate are said to delight in the daily changes they see in their son.

‘The only thing they are worried about is how he will cope with the long flight,’ a source said, before adding: ‘He is a really happy and chilled little boy but they have warned people he might be a little grumpy.’
