The second detachment of American troops arrived in Monrovia this Sunday to bolster health services in the country according to a source speaking to Agence France-Press.

The United States is expected to send a total of 3,000 soldiers to Liberia to train health workers fighting to contain the outbreak of Ebola that has so far claimed the lives of 2,800 across west Africa.

'Some American troops came soon this morning. They arrived with tactical jeeps,' said the unnamed source, who said the troops arrived in a single aircraft.

The Pentagon announced Friday that a C-17 carrying equipment and 7 service personnel had already landed in Liberia.

Two aircraft with a total of 45 troops were set to follow, according to Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson.

The U.S. mission in Liberia will be led by Major General Darryl Williams and undergo recruitment and training of health workers.

Military engineers are also being dispatched to construct care centers for Ebola patients.

The Ebola outbreak will likely be on the agenda when the United Nations General Assembly meets this week. 

A resolution adopted at the Security Council last Thursday called the outbreak of Ebola a 'threat to 'international peace and security.'

Care: A new treatment center dubbed the 'Island Clinic has beds for Ebola patients. The afflicted have previously been turned away due to a lack of staff and beds

Reuters updated the death toll in the affected west African countries to more than 2,800.

Sierra Leone imposed a three-day nationwide shutdown over the weekend to set the brakes against the spread of the virus.

The State Department said it supported the measure, but the World Health Organization was critical, saying that quarantines should be 'proportionate and evidence-based.'

The Pentagon has so far spent $30million as part of the United States' effort to train and support health workers.

President Obama said that troops would not provide direct care to patients.
