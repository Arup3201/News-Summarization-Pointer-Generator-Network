David Hamnett (pictured) was being treated for sleep apnoea, a condition that can halt breathing during sleep around the time when his car crashed on the M5

A drunken driver who crashed his car at 100mph has avoided jail after telling a court he was ‘sleep driving’.

David Hamnett, 47, had been drinking whisky and wine before getting behind the wheel of his Volvo S40 while, he claimed, he was still asleep.

He travelled 150 miles at up to 100mph before rear-ending another vehicle and slamming into a motorway’s central barrier.

The marine engineer was cut free from the wreckage wearing a  T-shirt and jogging bottoms with bare feet. He was found to be almost twice the drink-drive limit.

Hamnett told a court he had been ‘sleep driving’ after getting into his car to drive to Devon, where he works during the week, from his home in Ormskirk, Lancashire.

He said he must have been asleep during the entire drive before the crash in Worcestershire in the early hours.

The married father of two told Shrewsbury Crown Court he had put his ‘sleeping clothes’ on to go to bed and woke up to find himself in the smash on the M5.

However Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said it was ‘highly unlikely’ he could have been asleep behind the wheel without crashing for two hours.

Judge Peter Barrie accepted Hamnett had a sleeping disorder and that it was possible he may have got into his car while asleep. But he said he had likely carried on with the journey after waking.

Hamnett was convicted of dangerous driving and given a 12-month community order, banned from driving for six months and ordered to take an advanced test.

Judge Barrie said of the crash in the early hours of Saturday July 9, 2011: ‘This was a highly dangerous incident at high speed, weaving on a motorway and causing an accident in which you and the occupants of another car suffered significant injuries.

An aggravating feature was that you were well over the drink-drive limit.’

Hamnett claimed he travelled the entire 150 miles in a state of ‘parasomnia’.

Dr John O’Reilly, from the North West
Regional Sleep Service, based at Aintree University Hospital in 
Liverpool, confirmed he had undergone treatment for sleep disorders.

But prosecution witness Dr Idzikowski
said it was ‘highly unlikely’ that anyone could have negotiated a 
150-mile journey without waking up.

Hamnett, who was sentenced last week,
said yesterday that he had driven home from Plymouth to Lancashire on 
the Friday then gone to bed after a drink with his wife Janet, a nurse.

He insisted he had woken trapped inside his mangled car and still has no recollection of how he ended up there.

At the time of the accident Hamnett –
who fractured his spine and spent a month in hospital – was undergoing 
treatment for sleep apnoea, a condition that affects breathing while 
asleep.

He continued: ‘I’d had a few episodes where I had woken up to find myself walking around the house.

‘I’d not thought that much about it 
because it was so infrequent. It turned out that sleep driving was 
actually quite common also. I think it’s a long, straight road and 
driving along it is a fairly simple task.

‘I was in my pyjamas, I had no money 
and wallet, and I had just driven all the way back from work so why on 
earth would I want to go back there on a Saturday morning?’

The research and development director for a marine engineering firm has dropped from 24stone to 15stone since the crash.

He says the weight loss seems to have cured his sleep problems and curbed his sleepwalking.
