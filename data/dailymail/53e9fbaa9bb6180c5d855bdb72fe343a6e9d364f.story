He has been branded the coolest dad ever for taking his four-year-old to the race track for a drift-driving session. 

Anton from Kazakhstan, who goes by the YouTube username of Toxa Avdeyev,  uploaded a video showing his son's wide-eyed reaction to speeding around a race track while drift-driving.

And his son Timofey screams in fear and delight as his father races around the track, performing screeching turns.

The little boy screams for the majority of the minute-long video, but it turns out that he was really enjoying himself.

The video is a follow-up to one made last year by Anton with his son, which garnered nearly one million views.

There are mixed reactions to the video, with some claiming Anton is the most amazing dad ever, while others question his decision to take his son race driving.

A user referring to himself as SuperNuclearDeath wrote: 'Both stupid and awesome at the same time!'

Although the tot initially looks petrified, he's really having the time of his life as his dad races around the track

This is the second video Anton has uploaded of their father-son drift-driving adventures 

Their first video garnered over 1 million views - thanks to Timofey's adorable facial expressions

Another commenter Quazacolt added: 'Your kid finally understood fear it seems :P

'Nonetheless he still loves it from what i can tell... must be nice to have free "roller coaster" rides all the time ;)'

As his dad slows down his tricked-out Subaru and pulls off the track, adorable Timofey gives his his dad a thumbs up, along with a big smile and a high-five.

And for those worrying about the tot's safety - fear not.

'The action takes place on a special secure closed track with no other cars,' Anton wrote alongside the video.
