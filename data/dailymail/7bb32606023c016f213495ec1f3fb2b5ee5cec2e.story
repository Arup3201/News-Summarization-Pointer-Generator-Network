Chris Froome was hit by a stick during stage 20 of the Tour of Spain.

The Team Sky rider - beaten in the last 500m by Spaniard Alberto Condator - was trying to catch his rival on the final climb when a stick – believed to have been thrown by a fan - hit his helmet.

Froome, however, took the incident in good humour, later taking to Twitter to post a picture of the incident with the message: ‘And people ask me why I ride with my head down?!’

Contador’s victory extends his lead to 1min and 37 seconds over the Brit, who is 58 seconds ahead of third-placed Alejandro Valverde.

Contador is now all but assured victory in Sunday's final stage.

Froome tweeted after the stage: 'Emptied the tank out there today, what a battle! Thank you for all the support.'
