FA chairman Greg Dyke, whose controversial England Commission is causing major ructions, has now antagonised the Premier League by bringing forward publication of the findings.

Dyke had been expected to delay the launch until next week so as not to deflect attention from the Premier League climax on Sunday.

Controversy: FA chairman Greg Dyke will present his recommendations at Wembley on Thursday

But instead Dyke, having received unanimous support from the FA board, will present his recommendations at Wembley on Thursday - much to the annoyance of the top flight, who had been told that their last set of fixtures would be fully respected.

Relations between the FA and Premier League - not great at the best of times - have been further strained by the belief at Gloucester Place that they have not been properly consulted during the Commission process. They have not even been sent a full copy of the report.

Concern: Premier League fear England report could deflect attention from the climax on Sunday

However, the FA insist the Premier League, who have two representatives on their board, have been kept fully in the loop with numerous meetings and all available literature. 

The feeling on the FA board was that parts of the Commission report were already in the public domain. So, rather than let opponents drip-feed further information, it was better to get everything out in the open.

There are fears at Leeds United that numerous staff will be axed in a purge by new owner Massimo Cellino.

Purge: Massimo Cellino has been at Leeds conducting a root and branch investigation

Miami-based Cellino, who took over the club last month, has been at Elland Road conducting a root and branch investigation.

And the Italian has decided there needs to be a major streamlining of the workforce, with the academy operation one of the areas that will be hit hardest, along with management and administrative staff.

BBC Sport, as if they haven't got enough sports PR operatives running around, for some reason allowed Rio Ferdinand (above) to have his agent Jamie Moralee and publicist Justin Rigby present in media interviews at their World Cup launch. Rigby even intervened in the press questioning because he felt there had been too much talk about Manchester United.

Danny Mills, the most ridiculed member of Greg Dyke's England Commission, has gone native to the extent of describing newspaper stories revealing some of the proposals in advance of Thursday's launch as 'selfish and irresponsible'.

Mills, who said he had attended 25 Commission meetings, has totally bought into Dyke's blueprint, claiming everyone needs to read the full 50-page report to understand the nuances. 'This is the way forward,' said Dyke's disciple.

Phil trains on at Beeb

Phil Neville is preparing for his first England match as a BBC co-commentator - the World Cup opener against Italy on June 14, likely to be watched by an audience of 15 million - with all the dedication he showed in his playing career.

Dedication: Phil Neville has completed five trial runs at matches to prepare for being BBC co-commentator

Neville has completed five trial runs at matches with gantry colleague Guy Mowbray, attended BBC speech tutoring and done plenty of homework on the opposition. He has also tapped into the knowledge of brother Gary, who regularly fills the same difficult role for Sky.

Adam Silver, the new commissioner of the NBA, has earned deserved acclaim for throwing the book at LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling over his racist comments. But it is Silver's long-time predecessor David Stern who is being honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the sport industry Oscars tonight.  Not so easy to understand is how the ECB can be in the running for governing body of the year after the Ashes debacle, or troubled Manchester United for best brand.

The MCC brought in leading sports architect Rod Sheard, designer of the Olympic Stadium, to support their case at yesterday's AGM to stick with 85cm of leg room in the proposed Warner Stand renovation at Lord's. But the committee suffered an embarrassing defeat, with members voting by a 70 per cent majority for 90cm between the rows.
