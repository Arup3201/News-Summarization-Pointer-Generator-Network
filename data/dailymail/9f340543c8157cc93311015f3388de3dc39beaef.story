Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Kim Kallstrom will leave Arsenal at the end of the season when his loan deal expires.

The Swede arrived on loan from Spartak Moscow in January but has made just four appearances for the Gunners, one of those being the 1-0 win over West Brom on Sunday.

But the Arsenal manager confirmed that Kallstrom will not be staying at the Emirates beyond the end of his current loan deal.

Wenger said: â€˜He is on loan, so he belongs to Moscow and will go back to Moscow.â€™

Kallstrom has had an indifferent time, impressing in a win over West Ham but spending much of his spell in north London injured.

Indeed, when he signed for Arsenal he could not play straight away because of a back problem.

Kallstrom, 31, has made 108 appearances for his country Sweden and scored 16 goals.
