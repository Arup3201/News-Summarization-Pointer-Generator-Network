Evelyn Davey was forced to wait on the wet pavement with passers-by for two hours when she fell in the street 

A great-grandmother was left in agony on a rain-soaked pavement after suffering a fall because emergency services were too busy to come to her aid.

Despite being called only moments after Evelyn Davey slipped and broke her arm, paramedics failed to get to the pensioner for two hours.

The 89-year-old’s anguished cries were heard by members of the public who wrapped her in blankets while holding umbrellas over her.

But the crowd of helpers was unable to administer any first aid to Mrs Davey due to the amount of pain she was in so they were forced to wait for an ambulance.

When North East Ambulance Service finally arrived at the scene in Ormesby, North Yorkshire, her legs had gone numb.

The service blamed the delay on ‘high demand’ but the passers-by who came to Mrs Davey’s help said they were shocked at her treatment. 

‘As time went on she was getting colder and colder and we were getting more worried,’ said Barbara Leyshon, secretary of a social club near where Mrs Davey fell.

 ‘I can’t believe how long she had to stay like that.’ 

CCTV of the incident shows the frail pensioner sitting on the sodden pavement as passers-by rush to her aid. 

Frightened that moving her would cause further injury, Mrs Davey was given blankets to keep herself warm as she waited for help.    

Mrs Davey's son-in-law, Ray Porter, was horrified when he and his wife arrived at hospital an hour after learning the pensioner had fallen to find that she still hadn't been collected.  

'We went straight to the hospital but when we arrived at 1.45pm, they knew nothing about it and did not know where Evelyn was. 

'We just assumed that she would have been taken there by that time.

The pensioner crashed onto the curb, hurting her left arm. After the fall, she was in too much pain to move

'After a while we got sick of waiting so I rang the club and they told me that she was still outside so we drove there and saw two ambulances outside.'

'We can’t believe it and will definitely be putting in a letter of complaint.' 

A spokesman for North East Ambulance Service, who last week came under fire when a 15-year-old boy waited two hours for paramedics after breaking his leg, blamed the long delay on high demand. 

Evelyn Davey, 89, was walking along the damp pavement when she lost her footing and fell onto her side 

Passers-by and club members rushed out to wait with Mrs Davey who was not collected for two hours 

'We were called a 12.38pm to reports of a woman who had suffered as fall, sustaining a non-life threatening injury to her shoulder.

'At the time we were handling a high volume of emergencies.

'A crew became available to attend at 2.40pm and the patient was taken to James Cook University Hospital.' 

Mrs Davey is still recovering in hospital.
