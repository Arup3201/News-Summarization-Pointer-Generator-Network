Former Liverpool players including Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso are poised to return to Anfield for a special charity match at the end of this month.

Steven Gerrard has thrown his support behind plans to stage a game during the international break on Sunday, March 29 which would feature team-mates from his 17-year career.

John Arne Riise and Luis Garcia have confirmed they will take part while Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher is also due to be involved.

Proceeds from the game would benefit the local community with the Liverpool FC Foundation likely to be the main beneficiary if it goes ahead. A full house at Anfield could generate in excess of £500,000.

Torres, Reina and Alonso are among those who have been invited to play, although their involvement depends on international call-ups and also permission from their club sides.

Luis Suarez is unlikely to be there as Uruguay face Morocco in a friendly in Agadir on Saturday, March 28. Javier Mascherano has the same problem with Argentina scheduled to face El Salvador and Ecuador.

Current England internationals such as Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling are also likely to be with Roy Hodgson's side who face Lithuania at Wembley on Friday, March 27 before flying to Italy for a friendly on Tuesday, March 31.
