Stocking up on baby accessories before a birth can be time-consuming, expensive and sometimes stressful, so it is always best to plan well ahead.

And for Australians who can plan their baby's birth with forensic precision, help is at hand... in the unlikely form of furniture giant IKEA.

The Swedish homeware emporium is offering the nation's most efficient parents-to-be a free cot, just so long as their baby arrives nine months to the day from Valentine's Day.

It will gift a $99 Sniglar cradle to any family able to prove their newborn entered the world on November 14 later this year.

Proof of birth required: The special promotion was advertised in Australian newspapers yesterday next to a cut-out coupon and a picture of the cradle beside the words: 'FREE for babies born nine months from today'

The special promotion was advertised in Australian newspapers yesterday next to a cut-out coupon and a picture of the cradle beside the words: 'FREE for babies born nine months from today.

Parents will have to keep the coupon safe until November and present it to IKEA alongside a 'proof of birth' in order to claim their baby prize.

The ad goes on to declare a limit of 'one cot per baby', adding firmly: 'Delivery is not included.'

With This Allen Key I Thee Wed: It was not the only Valentine's Day publicity stunt implemented by IKEA Australia this year as the firm's Sydney store hosted an elaborate ceremony yesterday

DIY Bridesmaids: Every element of the special day featured IKEA products handpicked by the happy couple, including crockery, lighting, dining furniture, decorations, glassware '

This was not the only Valentine's Day publicity stunt implemented by IKEA Australia this year.

Yesterday a couple were married in an elaborate ceremony in the country's Sydney store before sitting down to meatballs at the reception.

In an Australian first, romantic 
flat-packers Chad Martin and Lynne Klanbida walked down the aisle at 
IKEA Tempe after winning the wedding of their dreams, which saw over 500
entries from homeware lovers across Australia.

Love in the aisles: 'Our visits to IKEA over the years have actually brought the two of us closer!'

Lynne said: 'We wanted to get married in IKEA for a very simple reason - we adore IKEA.

'It felt right to be able to show our
commitment to one another by getting married somewhere we both love and
to show the world that romance can be alive anywhere, even in the 
aisles of IKEA. Our visits to IKEA over the years have actually brought 
the two of us closer!'
