James McGee was unable to keep his New York fairy tale going at the US Open.

The Irishman achieved his dream of competing in the main draw at a grand slam thanks to a tremendous run through qualifying at Flushing Meadows.

McGee, ranked 194, has spent his whole career until now fighting to make a living on the lowest rungs of the professional game.

Positive start: McGee, playing in his first ever Grand Slam, won the first set against Aleksandr Nedovyesov

Opportunity: McGee was in the main draw at Flushing Meadows after winning three qualifying matches

Big cheque: The Irishman, ranked 194, pocketed $35,000 at the US Open despite the first-round loss

A first-round clash against Kazakh Aleksandr Nedovyesov, also ranked outside the top 100, appeared to offer the opportunity for further heroics and McGee made a great start.

The 27-year-old's family and friends had flown out from Ireland to watch him and he broke serve in the opening game before going on to take the first set.

But Nedovyesov fought back to win the second and third sets and move a break ahead in the fourth.

Eventual winner: Kazakh Aleksandr Nedovyesov, ranked 107, beat McGee in four sets on Monday

Best result: Nedovyesov had never qualified for the main draw at the US Open and is now into round two

McGee recovered that and forced a tie-break but it was his opponent who came out on top in a 4-6 6-2 6-1 7-6 (7/3) victory.

Nevertheless, McGee leaves New York with his head held high and his wallet weighed down by a cheque for more than 35,000 US dollars.
