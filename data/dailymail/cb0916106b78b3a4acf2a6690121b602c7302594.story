The owner of an Arlington, Texas strip-club shut down by
city officials after allegations of prostitution and drug trafficking has been
arrested for hiring hit-men to kill the local mayor.

FBI agents apprehended 34-year-old Ryan Walker Grant after
he allegedly contacted an intermediary secretly working with the bureau and promised
to pay $10,000 each for the murder of Mayor Robert Cluck and Dallas attorney Tom
Brandt.

Reportedly furious that Cluck and prosecutor Brandt
were blocking his attempts to re-open his Flashdancer Cabaret club, it is alleged that Grant, went to the go-between with the intention of having the pair killed.

Informing the intermediary that he wanted Mexican nationals
to commit the crimes and then return across the border, the strip-club boss had
already had two phone conversations discussing the
alleged crimes.

Meeting the person known as 'Individual A' at his home last
Monday, Grant checked to see if he was carrying a wire before he confirmed the
contract killings.

Instead a sworn affidavit from the FBI middle-man provided
the evidence needed for a SWAT style raid on Grant at his up-market Kennedale
home last Monday.

Targeted: Mayor Robert Cluck of Arlington was allegedly the subject of a contract killing and had a $10,000 price tag on his head

The unidentified intermediary’s affidavit said that upon his
final meeting with Grant he handed him photos and contact information for the
people he wanted killed by the Mexican hit-men he thought he was hiring.

Insistent on using a go-between, the affidavit quoted Grant
as having given the killing of Mayor Cluck and Brandt a lot of thought.

‘I can't just call up my dude and say go hit them, this is too high-profile,’ said Grant in federal documents.

The contract killing was apparently Grant’s way of resolving a dispute between himself and Arlington officials over the closure of his Flashdancer Cabaret club on 520 N. Watson Road.

Both Cluck and Brandt had roles in the stalling of issuing a new license for the club which Grant agreed to close temporarily last year after 25 drug violations and 15 alcohol related violations had been logged since May 2008.

‘They just jacked me for a year of business and they're trying to jack me indefinitely, when we had a deal, and they just reneged on it,’ Grant said, according to the affidavit.

Claiming that he was set to lose up to $800,000 a year with the closure of the club, Grant is being held by U.S. marshals and scheduled to appear at a detention hearing at 2:30 p.m on Friday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cureton.

Officials attached to the case argue that Grant should remain in federal custody as he is a flight risk and because of the level of intended violence in the case.

Bone of Contention: Flashdancer Cabaret club which has not had its licensed renewed and has been closed for year

One of Arlington’s last businesses connected with the sex trade, Flashdancer Cabaret club was closed after a deal between the city and the state attorney general's office.

City officials named the popular club as rife with drugs, prostitution, aggravated assaults and other criminal activity.

Faced with a trial unless he closed last year, Grant was said to be furious that Arlington Police Chief Theron Bowman planned to revoke Flashdancer's license to operate as an adult business after Grant was accused of filing misleading paper work to the city and condoning sexual acts on the premises.

One of the alleged contract ‘hits’, Tom Brandt used the testimony of three Arlington undercover vice-squad members and video clips to build his case.

The original license Grant held expired on February 6 and despite the re-application Arlington Deputy Chief Lauretta Hill has still not ruled on the revocation following the drug, alcohol and sex charges.

One clip being used in the case to remove Grant’s license shows Grant himself having sex in the office as a manager sits a few feet away and three other video’s show dancers rubbing themselves provocatively in front of customers.

However, Mr Grant’s father Ron has refuted all charges brought against his son.

‘Good lord no,’ answered Ron as to whether he believed his son would have sanctioned two contract killings.

The centre of controversy: Arlington city officials had claimed that offences related to drugs, alcohol and prostitution had all taken place at the Flashdancer club

‘That is because as far as you can say he was looking forward to re-opening.

‘No, he certainly didn’t have any animosity, well, he wasn’t happy about it but he certainly didn’t voice any desire to harm anyone about it that’s for sure.’
