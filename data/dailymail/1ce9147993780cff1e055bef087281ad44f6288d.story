Neymar has once again endeared himself to the Brazilian public after his heartwarming gesture in training on Sunday.

Ahead of Brazil's World Cup opener against Croatia on June 12, a young fan ran on to meet his heroes as they attempt to win the tournament for a record sixth time.

The youngster's dream appeared to be dashed when security took him away, before Barcelona star Neymar jogged over telling them to stop.

The 22-year-old then proceeded to enjoy a light kick-about with the child before making his day even better by including him in a selfie with team-mates Marcelo, Luis Gustavo, Willian, David Luiz and captain Thiago Silva.

It's not the first time that the forward has shown a personal touch towards his fans.

Following Brazil's 5-0 friendly win at South Africa in March, a young Bafana Bafana supporter ran onto the pitch to meet Neymar and his illustrious team-mates.

After being initially stopped by security, Neymar urged the boy back onto the pitch where he posed for pictures with world-renowned Barcelona forward Neymar before being hoisted up by the Brazilians in a heartwarming display.Â
