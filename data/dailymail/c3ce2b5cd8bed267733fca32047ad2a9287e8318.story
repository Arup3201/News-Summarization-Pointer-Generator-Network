Justice Secretary Chris Grayling accused Labour and the Lib Dems of wanting to 'clobber the rich'

A Tory Cabinet minister has launched an attack on Labour and his Liberal Democrat colleagues, claiming they want to penalise the nation's 'wealth creators'.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling hit out at Labour as he warned against the 'politics of envy' and efforts to 'clobber the rich'.

Mr Grayling said protecting the interests of job creators would be a Tory 'red line' in any future government.

Yesterday, Ed Miliband declared he was bringing back socialism as he unveiled a raft of left-wing policies including an increase in wages for the lowest paid and forcing schools to stay open for longer.

Mr Grayling said Labour wanted to squeeze the rich to pay for a larger welfare state.

In an article in the Sunday Telegraph timed to coincide with the start of the Labour Party conference today, Mr Grayling said: 'The politics of 
envy is back. What do Labour want to do? They want to penalise the 
wealth creators. Higher taxes for the rich.

'To pay for what Labour really wants - a bigger and bigger welfare state.'

The CBI and Institute of Directors criticised Labour's manifesto pledges, insisting that 'growth must come first'.

Labour shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves indicated people earning £60,000 a year might not feel 'particularly rich' and should not be targeted by tax increases.

She insisted Labour had 'no plans or desire' to increase taxes for people in that income bracket, but instead the focus would be on the 'privileged few' at the very top of the income scale.

The Liberal Democrats have made a levy on properties worth more than £2 million a flagship policy and at the party's conference a briefing to MPs suggested people with an income of £50,000 could be in line for tax hikes.

Aides to Nick Clegg strenuously denied that there was any plan to 'clobber' people on £50,000, insisting that the party was focused on taxing wealth rather than income.

Mr Grayling's comments will be seen as a further distancing in policy between the Conservatives and their Coalition partners, whose party conference was held last week, as the Tories seek an outright victory at the General Election.

'One of the big themes of last week's conference was higher taxes,' Mr Grayling said. 'They want to penalise the wealth creators too. Both say it's a red line for any future government.'

But in a message aimed at rallying support ahead of his party's conference in Manchester later this month Mr Grayling said: 'Conservatives want to support wealth creators and job creators. That's a red line for us.'
