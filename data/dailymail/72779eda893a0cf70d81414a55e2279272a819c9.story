Louis van Gaal is ‘a democratic, empathetic human being’. He has a ‘strong personality’ as well as a ‘strong philosophy’ and he believes he can ‘live up to all the expectations’.

And with that unrevealing self-portrait, one of the most significant men in British sport introduced himself to his public.

In the week of a compelling Open golf championship and a crucial Lord’s Test match, the introduction of the latest manager of Manchester United won an extraordinary share of attention.

This owes much to the nation’s ongoing obsession with football but still more to a curious public fascination with events at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal was playing politics when he described United as ‘the biggest club in the world’. But the claim was not entirely laughable, hence the importance of his new post.

United’s recent activities on the field have been wholly underwhelming. Having won the Premier League title with an ailing team a year ago, they saw that team fall apart last season, to the extent that they were flattered by finishing seventh.

Even a manager of 23 years’ experience, a man who has won everything that European club football has to offer, would be hard-pressed to fashion anything remotely formidable from the prevailing mediocrity. But then, we remember their extraordinary resources.

Last week, United concluded a 10-year, £75million-per-year kit deal with adidas. Already in place is a seven-year, £51m-per-year Chevrolet sponsorship, plus a trifling £17m-per-year deal with AON for, of all things, their training kit.

These are merely the highlights, for they are following all manner of lucrative avenues. The fact is, they are wading through oceans of bank-notes, enjoying the kind of resources which no British club have ever experienced.

Some will consider this kind of affluence to be mildly obscene and they may have a point. But since wealth ultimately dictates results, sooner or later United will get things right, and the consequences will be dramatic.

Will Van Gaal be the man to deliver the required results? Clearly, nobody knows; equally clearly, it does not matter. For the fact is that Manchester United have ceased to be the football club that we all knew and many loved.

Instead, they are a corporation who regard football as their ‘core business’ but who have a whole stream of alternative  activities, all producing profits for the Glazer family of Palm Beach, Florida.

In this corporation, Van Gaal effectively serves as chief executive (football). If his division produces results, all well and good. If those results should falter — and we are talking months rather than seasons — then he will be replaced.

His last two jobs, with Bayern Munich and the Holland national team, each lasted for two years. Although he has signed a three-year contract with United, it seems highly unlikely that he will see it through to the end.

For scrutiny will be intense, the pressures will be unrelenting and his principal employers — none of whom could ever be mistaken for a ‘football person’ — will be intolerant of anything save overwhelming success.

But Van Gaal is 62. He understands how the executive game is played and we may be sure that his contract will insulate him from the perils of premature redundancy. Even so, he will not be at Old Trafford for the long term.

He will not be given time to identify and cultivate young talent and he would not expect such indulgence. Instead, he will be asked to supply titles and trophies to order. And should he fail, then he will be treated like any other executive who misses his sales targets.

Such is the way in which modern corporations are run. Just 14 months have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson departed the manager’s office and already the memories are sepia-tinted.

Which is not to say that he will not do an efficient job, however brief his tenure. An untalented man could not have won titles in Holland, Spain and Germany, nor could he have handled his country’s World Cup efforts with such energy and flair.

He will upset a good many players and staff, he will fall out with referees and opposing managers on a regular basis and when the axe falls, he will doubtless blame the media.

But while he is there, he will know where his loyalty lies. Not to the 75,731 who fill the stadium every other week; cheering and singing and creating that raucous atmosphere which television finds so appealing. Not to the legions of disenfranchised United fans, remotely following every pass and tackle. Certainly not to any romantic notion of the men who built the club; from Busby, Best and the Babes, through to Giggs and Rooney.

No, Louis van Gaal must serve a more demanding constituency, one composed of adidas, Chevrolet, AON and that folksy, down-home family from Palm Beach, Florida. In short, he must place himself at the mercy of the balance sheet, as befits a chief executive (football).

By that test, the young Ferguson would have lasted about six months. We must hope that United’s latest ‘democratic, empathetic human being’ stays around for a little longer.

Germans were a class apart

However much some of us wanted to see Lionel Messi lift the World Cup, the trophy ultimately came to rest in the most deserving hands.

Germany’s power and class set them apart from their challengers. Yet only in the week following the final did we learn the true extent of that class.

There was the training centre they built in the fishing village of Santo Andre in Bahia state, their constructive contributions to the local economy and the efforts they made to socialise with the local people.

Then there was their Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil, who had decided to devote a slice of his World Cup bonus to paying the hospital bills of 11 Brazilian children. When Germany won the Cup, he expanded that number to 23.

Of course, Ozil and his colleagues can afford such gestures but that is scarcely the point. This was a World Cup held in the spiritual home of the game and Germany had recognised the need to honour the occasion by respecting their hosts. It was a considerable performance by a remarkable football nation.

Tenacious Tiger battles on

If you wanted to follow Tiger Woods’s progress at The Open, then you had to search a long way down the field. 

The false promise of an opening 69 was followed by the cruel reality of a 77, then a 73 to put him three over.

He made the cut by a single shot. Somebody congratulated him and he had the grace to appear embarrassed. 

At such times, we inevitably recall how it used to be, when his touch was impeccable and his game was governed by a fierce rage for perfection.

Tenacious: Tiger Woods is battling on at the Open despite a disappointing week

Even those elders who remember Hogan and revered Palmer, Nicklaus and the gods of the game had seen nothing quite like him.

In his days of glory, the majors were reduced to a struggle for second place. The winner was predestined, the trophy was spoken for.

At 38, he must be aware that such days will never return. But he battles on, searching for the spark, with a tenacity which does him great credit.

As an intensely proud man, Tiger Woods will neither welcome nor value our sympathy. So he must settle for our unbounded admiration.

PS

A drowsy Lord’s afternoon. England are grafting diligently in the heat and Sir Ian Botham is gossiping with David Lloyd, aka ‘Bumble’, about the dogs they have owned.

‘That one you had,’ says Botham, ‘the one who used to bite my ankles.’ ‘Bertie,’ says Bumble. ‘Yeah, Bertie,’ says Botham. ‘What happened to him?’ ‘He’s on the mantelpiece, wi’ me Dad,’ says Bumble.

Truly, there are times when Sky’s admirable cricket coverage seems to have been scripted by Alan Bennett.
