Vets in Ukraine are struggling to identify a 'mutant' animal shot by hunters in a remote area of the former Soviet republic.  

Locals say it is a mystery 'Chupacabra' -  allegedly sighted a few times in recent years - that preys on rabbits, goats and house animals.

Grey in colour and with ‘fangs’ and a longish neck, it has shorter front legs, slightly resembling a kangaroo, while also showing a likeness to a dog and a fox, say those who have seen it. 

Mystery: The discovery of the strange animal in Ukraine has baffled experts

There were claims that it could be a 
'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it 
maybe a hybrid originating from a Soviet plant conducting tests on 
animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development.  

‘A creature we were not supposed to see has escaped from a secret defence lab,’ said one comment.

‘The
 animal doesn't look like a fox or a wolf, or a raccoon,’  Mikhail 
Ilchenko, deputy head of the district veterinary service in 
Mikhailovskoe, told Komsomolskaya Pravda, Ukraine.

‘It
 cannot even be a marten.  I have never seen such animal before. But, 
judging by the fangs, I can definitely say that it is a predator.’

Speculation: The animal could be the mythical 'Chupacabra' - which is Spanish for goat sucker - is a legendary cryptid rumoured to inhabit parts of North and South America

Local vets took the skinny, short-haired creature to the Zoological Museum of Zaporozhye National University.

‘There is something common with a fox, and a dog,’ said director Alexander Korotya. 

Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock.

The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood.

Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America.

Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in Canóvanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed.

Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas.

‘But
 I cannot identify what kind of animal it is. For example, its canine 
teeth are similar similar to a fox, but smaller in size - like a marten.
  

‘Yet a marten has a 
different type of skull. If to compare with an otter's head, then the 
ears are too small. It has a wide nose and a stretched muzzle.

‘My opinion is that its most likely a hybrid animal or a mutant.’

Reports of such a creature - but with varying descriptions - have appeared in the Ukrainian media in recent years. 

One lurid and unconfirmed version is 
that it sucked blood from chickens and rabbits and domestic animals 
which it killed  in remote villages.  

It
 has been described as orange or grey in colour, with front shorter than
 hind legs, and with an ability to jump resembling a kangaroo.

Dogs are reported to have been frightened of it, according to villagers.
