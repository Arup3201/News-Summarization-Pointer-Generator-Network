The public are being urged to cancel planned visits to the Tower of London this weekend to see the magnificent poppy display as the site is becoming too overcrowded.

Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, who manage the exhibition, are asking visitors to consider coming the following weekend, when half-term has ended. 

The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation will be complete in just 11 days - and has been a phenomenal success attracting around four million visitors from around the world.

Crowds: Thousands of people turned out to catch a glimpse of the installation this week - mostly due to the half-term school holidays

Contrast: The Tower of London, first built in the 11th century, is surrounded by a sea of scarlet poppies in the shadow of the Shard - which became Europe's tallest building when it was completed in 2012

And as the display nears completion and congestion around the site gets worse, Transport for London (TfL) has closed Tower Hill, the nearest Tube station.

The closure is likely to cause severe congestion with thousands of people flooding through two Tube stations instead of three.

Earlier in the week some visitors described how the poppy memorial was so busy at the beginning of the half-term holiday that there were queues of around one hour just to get in and out of the nearest Tube stations. 

Others said the area was horribly congested with crowds desperately scrambling to get a look at the sea of flowers. 

Alert: Historic Royal Palaces, who manage the exhibition, posted this Tweet earlier - urging people to postpone planned weekend visits

Meticulous: Around 8,000 volunteers have been working on the powerful exhibition at the tower over the last four months

TfL admits 'large numbers of people' are expected over the weekend but claim engineering works were planned before the exhibition was known about.

TfL's decision to continue with their planned engineering works has been met with criticism on Twitter with one user calling the move 'crazy'.

A spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces said: 'We are really overwhelmed by the public response and are experiencing huge amounts of visitors.

On November 12 the same army of 8,000 volunteers who began planting them on July 17 will begin to uproot each bloom individually, before sending it off to be washed and posted on to its new owner

'Our advice to people is that if you want to come and get a really good view of the poppies this weekend, the best time would be before 10am or after 6pm. 

'The poppies are floodlit at night and look really beautiful. But we're encouraging as many people as possible to come next weekend when half-term is over.' 

As a result of the closure of Tower Hill, travelers are being advised to use Tube stations at London Bridge or Aldgate and TfL say their ambassadors will be on duty help with directions.

Most of the moat surrounding the Tower of London is now obscured by the exhibition's ceramic poppies - each one marking the death of a Commonwealth soldier during the First World War.  

Busy: Up to four million people from around the world have now visited the exhibition at the Tower of London

Art: Created by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, with setting by stage designer Tom Piper, the poppies also mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War in 1914

Restricted: The moat is not open during the installation and people are advised to view the poppies from above on Tower Hill

Charity: The project will help support six service charities in the UK including Cobseo, Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help for Heroes, The Royal British Legion and SSAFA

On Remembrance Day, November 11, the last of the 888,246 poppies, each one sold for £25, will be be planted. 

The very next day, the same army of 8,000 volunteers who began planting them on July 17 will begin to uproot each bloom individually, before sending it off to be washed and posted on to its new owner. 

The installation, he brainchild of ceramic artist Paul Cummins,  is expected to raise around £11.2million for military charities including Help for Heroes and Combat Stress.

Warning: With thousands expected to flock to the site this weekend, Tfl have closed Tower Hill, the nearest Tube Station, for engineering works - visitors are being advised to use Tube stations at London Bridge or Aldgate

Labour of love: Volunteers are busy putting the final touches to the installation while thousands of people watch from the moat path

Visitor numbers to the Tower have vastly increased since work on the poignant memorial began in July. A Tower of London spokesman today said the attraction is 'extremely busy' and confirmed visitor numbers have increased greatly compared to the same period last year. 

The scarlet moat also appears to have helped entice visitors into the Tower itself, with reports of queues of up to two hours to see the famous Crown Jewels display.

The feature, which has seen potters in Cummins' Derbyshire studio work around the clock making poppies for the piece, was visited by the Queen two weeks ago and by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August.

Each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in Derby

Each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in Derby, making each poppy unique.

Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns. They are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals.

The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position.

The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing.

Ceramic artist Paul Cummins, who came up with the idea, has had a team working on the project since January.

He said: 'I was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from Derby. I approached the Tower as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate.

'The installation is transient, I found this poignant and reflective of human life, like those who lost their lives during First World War. I wanted to find a fitting way to remember them'.

He came up with the idea of creating a 'sea' of poppies two years and was delighted when the Tower of London decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer Tom Piper.

The artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large-scale installations for the Duke of Devonshire's Chatsworth House, Derby Royal Hospital, Althorp Estate and Blenheim Palace.
