Paramedic Richard Playford has been found guilty of misconduct after swearing at a patient last May

A paramedic has been found guilty of misconduct after he told a patient to 'shut the f**k up' before leaving him in the back of an ambulance.

Richard Playford, 64, launched the tirade of abuse at a 25-year-old man who had dialled 999 complaining of crippling stomach pains.

He then stormed out of the ambulance and was later found a mile away by shocked colleagues, a disciplinary hearing has heard.

Playford, who worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service for 30 years, has now been found guilty of misconduct. 

He quit the ambulance service shortly after the complaint was made against him in May last year.

But, despite the finding, Playford has been allowed to continue working in his new job at a private ambulance firm because a watchdog found he does not pose a risk to patients.

During a hearing at the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) in London, the paramedic said he was diabetic and was feeling unwell during the incident in May last year.

A panel of experts decided the paramedic's behaviour towards the man, called Patient A at the hearing, was 'inexplicable' and did amount to misconduct.

In a written ruling, the HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee said: 'By his own account, Mr Playford became very frustrated with Patient A and told him to "shut the f**k up".

'Mr Playford left the ambulance, leaving (another paramedic) to deal with and treat Patient A.

'His behaviour fell well below the standards of behaviour expected of a registered paramedic and amounts to misconduct.

'His decision to walk away was irresponsible and put Patient A at risk of potential harm. His medical condition is not regarded as either an excuse for, or a cause of, his misconduct.'

Sophie Lister, presenting the case for the HCPC, said Playford and fellow paramedic Raza Ahmed responded to a 999 call from the man, who was complaining of stomach pains on May 5 last year.

She said the row erupted when the patient stopped answering Playford's questions and said he 'did not like his tone and attitude'.

She added: 'Mr Playford said words to the effect of "That is it, I have had enough, I'm off" and exited the vehicle closing the door.' 

After he was tracked down by colleagues, he eventually returned to the ambulance and apologised for his behaviour.

The patient made a formal complaint when he reached the hospital and also alleged that Playford attempted to physically remove him from the ambulance during the incident.

The paramedic always denied this, insisting he was removing a blood pressure monitor, and the panel found the patient's claims were not proved.

It was also alleged that Playford took the keys to the ambulance's drug safe when he walked off, meaning the patient could not be given further pain relief.

The panel also found that this claim could not be proved as no one was sure where the keys were at the time.

Playford, who has type II diabetes, said his blood sugar was low on the day of the row and he had a headache.

He said he has been assaulted and abused by people he was trying to help in the past but had never retaliated. 

The panel accepted that the low blood sugar was a contributing factor to his 'loss of control' but was no excuse for his actions.

The hearing was told that, since resigning last year, he has begun working for a private ambulance firm and now works transferring patients to and from hospital and assists at sporting events.

Despite the finding of misconduct, he was allowed to remain a registered paramedic after the panel decided he was not a significant risk to patients in his new role.

The ruling stated: 'The Panel considers that Mr Playford has demonstrated insight into his misconduct. He has taken appropriate steps to ensure, so far as it is possible to do so, that the misconduct will not be repeated.'

It added: 'He is better able to control his blood sugar levels since his current employer permits him to take food and drink with him on duty and the intensity of his workload is reduced meaning that he is less often required to work for long periods without a break.'

After the hearing, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service can confirm that Paramedic Richard Playford was employed by the Trust when the incident occurred.

'Mr Playford resigned from his role with the Trust shortly after the incident and that resignation was accepted with immediate effect.

'Mr Playford hasn't been an employee of the Trust since late May 2013.

'The Trust always expects the highest level of care and professionalism from its staff and unfortunately that was not the case on this occasion.'
