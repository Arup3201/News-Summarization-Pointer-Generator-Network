A former U.S. soldier who shot dead an Iraqi prisoner after forcing him to strip naked during an unauthorized interrogation has been released from prison on parole.

After serving five years for the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur, former U.S. Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna emerged from the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth to the cheers of his family on Friday.

His relatives, who never gave up hope of his early release, drew him into a group prayer and held him tight.

'This is such a surreal feeling,' Behenna, dressed in an orange hoodie and gray sweat pants, told The Oklahoman.

'The only thing I’ve seen for the past five years is concrete, a little bit of grass, fence and razor wire.

'So this morning when they took me to see my family and all the people I truly care about, it’s a day I won’t forget.'

Behenna's mother, Vicki Behenna, said her 30-year-old son will return to Edmond, Oklahoma to work on cattle ranch and take classes at Oklahoma State University.

The ex-soldier had served five years of a 15-year sentence for his 2009 conviction on a charge of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone when he was released on Friday.

On May 16, 2008, just a few weeks after an improvised bomb attack killed two members of Behenna’s seven-man platoon in Iraq, Behenna killed known al-Qaida operative Ali Mansur while questioning him.

There was no dispute that Behenna was
 supposed to take the Iraqi prisoner home.

Instead took him to a 
secluded railroad culvert, stripped him naked and shot him twice after 
interrogating him at gunpoint about an April 2008 roadside bombing that 
killed two men under Behenna's command.

Behenna
 said he acted in self-defense when the man reached for Behenna's 
handgun.

The Army argued he could not claim self-defense because he was 
conducting an unauthorized interrogation at gunpoint.

Behenna's
 family had fought to overturn the conviction, but the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Armed Forces and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 
decision.

Behenna drew support from Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and the state's congressional delegation following his conviction.

'I
 am glad this long ordeal has finally come to an end for Michael Behenna
 and his family. Michael went to Iraq to serve his nation and to defend 
liberty both here and abroad,' Fallin said in a 
statement, following news of his parole.

'Instead, he found himself mourning the 
loss of his friends from the inside of a cell.'

The Army Clemency and Parole Board denied Behenna's request for clemency but granted him parole, Col. David Patterson said.

He said the decision was based on factors 'including a strong parole plan with family and community support'.

'believe the Army acted appropriately and compassionately in offering him parole,' Vicki Behenna said.

Sen. Jim Inhofe and Reps. James Lankford, Tom Cole, Frank Lucas, Markwayne Mullen and Jim Bridenstine, all Republicans, also issued a joint statement praising the decision to parole Behenna.

This was Behenna's first opportunity for parole.
