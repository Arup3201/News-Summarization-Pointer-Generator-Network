FA Chairman Greg Dyke has ruled out England bidding for a future World Cup while Sepp Blatter remains as FIFA President.

Instead, English football's governing body will focus on hosting UEFA tournaments - with Wembley bidding to host the Euro 2020 semi finals and final.

Dyke gave evidence to the Culture Media and Sport (CMS) select committee on Tuesday regarding the bidding process for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which has been plagued by allegations of corruption and bribery.

European focus: Dyke said the FA will instead go for UEFA tournaments due to the FIFA relationship issues

And the FA Chairman says there is no chance of a English World Cup while Blatter - who is expected to run for a fifth term in 2015 - remains in football's top job.

'We've already taken the decision that we will not bid for FIFA tournaments - our decision is we will concentrate in the years ahead on bidding for UEFA tournaments. We wouldn’t win (a future World Cup bid),' Dyke said.

'I don't think we should walk out of FIFA because within a week everyone has forgotten you.'

No-no: Greg Dyke ruled out any chance of The FA bidding for another World Cup under Sepp Blatter

Stop sign: The presence of Blatter will stop England bidding to host a World Cup, Dyke said

And Dyke believes that if Blatter does re-run, as he has announced his intention to, that he will win, despite opposition from The FA.

'Quite a lot of the European FAs made it very clear they didn't support him but I'm afraid from the rest of the world there's overwhelming support.

'If he runs again he'll win but I think it's unlikely we at the FA would vote for him.'

Good job: Dyke praised Roy Hodgson's work in Brazil despite England's early exit from the group

And Dyke, who has now been in the job for 12 months, praised England manager Roy Hodgson's work - despite the national team 
finishing bottom of their World Cup

Dyke 
reiterated his support for Hodgson but said the FA will look in 
September at making more fundamental changes to the English set-up.

'I thought Roy Hodgson did quite a good job (at the World Cup) - I've got a lot of time for him,' Dyke said.

'One of the
 big problems English football has is the average Premier League manager
 lasts 12 months if you take Arsene Wenger out.

Taking the applause: England's early exit didn't seem to bother Dyke as he gave evidence

'Their 
ability to look long-term therefore is going to be quite limited - in 
England your first job as a manager is to sort out your contract when 
you go in and the second is to sort out your contract when you leave.

'Our view is Roy has a four-year contract and he will continue that contract.

'Some 
progress was made. But what we are going to look at is are there more 
fundamental changes we need to make? We'll look at that in September.

'I think Hodgson is quite good. I have a lot of time for him.'

When asked whether Hodgson been subject to a performance review Dyke said: 'He's been on holiday.'
