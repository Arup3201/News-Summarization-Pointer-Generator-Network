Ashutosh Maharaj, seen here on a billboard in Punjab, has been in deep freeze for six weeks

An Indian guru declared dead six 
weeks ago has been put into a deep freezer by his followers - who are 
convinced he will come back to life.

Ashutosh
 Maharaj, the leader of the Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan (Divine Light 
Awakening Mission), is in a state of samadhi - the deepest form of 
meditation, according to his believers, and is sending them messages.

Mission spokesman Swami Vishalanand said followers were
 now waiting for him to end his meditation and expect him to step out of the freezer in the town of Nurmahal, in the state of Punjab, northern India. Until then they would perform their own 
meditation and spiritual sessions.

'Mahara-ji (a Hindi term of respect) is 
still sending messages through followers in their meditative stage to 
protect his body until he returns,' Mr Vishalanand said.

The decision to place MaharajÂ in a freezer was challenged in court by a man claiming to be his former driver, who alleged several followers were not releasing the body because they wanted a share of the guru's properties.

But the court rejected the man's claim after receiving information from authorities confirming his death, reportedly from a heart attack.

'The court rejected his pleas after the Punjab government said that the man is clinically dead and that it is up to his followers to decide what they want to do with the body,' Reeta Kohli, additional advocate general of Punjab state, said.

Senior district police officer Gurinder Singh Dhillon said police 'cannot interfere' now that the court has made its ruling.

Maharaj's website, which says the 
mission was founded in 1983 and has spiritual centres around the world, 
has thanked its followers for standing by the mission while the guru is 
'meditating'.

Mr Vishalanand said scores of spiritual leaders throughout history have traveled to the Himalayas for months of samadhi in freezing temperatures - before returning to life.

Another spokesman, who heads a nearby village where many of Maharaj's followers are living, said: 'When we close our eyes, we can talk to the Maharaj, who has assured us he will come back.'

Spiritual leaders have reportedly survived in the Himalayas for months, despite freezer-like temperatures
