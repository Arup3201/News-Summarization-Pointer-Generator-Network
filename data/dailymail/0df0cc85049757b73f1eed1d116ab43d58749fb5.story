An 18-year-old boy had a narrow escape after a post speared the driver's side of his windshield when he ran off the road while driving and using his cell phone.

Dale L McCauley was driving erratically on Saturday afternoon when he tried to pull a U-turn at high speed on a two-lane highway and smashed through a fence.

The incident took place in Bremerton, Washington State. Moments before the crash, witnesses told police that the young man had been talking on his cell phone and texting, his vehicle weaving across both lanes.

Washington State Patrol Trooper Russ Winger said the driver was lucky to be alive. He told MailOnline: 'If that post had struck him in the head or chest, it could have killed him.'

The teenager, who was driving a black Dodge SUV, was given a ticket for negligent driving which carries a fine of $550.

The teenager suffered only minor cuts and bruises to the face. He was checked out at the local hospital and later released.

No other vehicles were involved in the crash and McCauley had no passengers. No drugs or alcohol were involved in the incident, police said.
