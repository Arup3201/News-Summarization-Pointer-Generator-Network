Skiing a marathon isn’t easy. But knowing a handsome banker is waiting for you at the finish line can certainly spur a girl on.

Pippa Middleton celebrated her achievement with a very public kiss for new boyfriend Nico Jackson in St Moritz.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, 29, completed the gruelling Engadin Skimarathon in 2 hours 48 min, managing 233rd place out of 494 skiers in her class.

Afterwards she declared: ‘I’m not tired at all’.

Mr Jackson, 35, who finished eight minutes ahead of his girlfriend, waited to meet her, with both their families.

The public show of affection, combined with their families’ seal of approval, is the biggest signal yet that Pippa has finally found lasting love after dating a string of aristocratic men.

Even before the race the couple were spotted kissing as they waited in a ski lift queue. 

Away from the slopes, they enjoyed some window-shopping at Cartier.

The sports-mad pair met in a London nightclub last year and are said to have been dating ever since.

As
well as the Middletons, Mr Jackson’s parents, Ulrike and Martyn 
Jackson, who run a ski and sportswear shop in Folkestone, Kent, 
accompanied them to St Moritz last week.

Grammar School-educated Mr Jackson grew up in his parents’ redbrick terraced house.

After graduating from London’s Kingston University, he made his fortune as a stockbroker and works for Deutsche Bank.

‘He is tall, good-looking and has the most amazing blue eyes,’ a source told Hello! magazine.

‘He is incredibly charismatic and stands out from the crowd. He is a really good catch. Everyone is after him.’

Last month they were pictured walking hand-in-hand along a beach in Mustique while on holiday with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the Middleton family.
