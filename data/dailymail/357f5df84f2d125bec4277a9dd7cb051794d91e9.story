The family of a flight MH17 crash victim has condemned Sky News reporter Colin Brazier who was filmed live on air rifling through victims’ possessions – branding the footage 'sick.'

In a live broadcast, which has so 
far sparked 110 Ofcom complaints, the presenter was shown 
picking items – including a set of keys and a toothbrush – out of the 
open luggage before saying: ‘We really shouldn’t be doing this, I 
suppose.’

Speaking from the family home in Leicester, Richard Mayne’s older brother Thomas, 24, branded it 'sick' adding: 'I think it's totally out of order. It's not on.'

This evening Prime Minister David Cameron also condemned the reporter's actions branding it 'completely inappropriate'.

The Leeds University student was one of ten Britons to die when the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in Ukraine on Thursday.

Apology: Sky News reporter Colin Brazier apologised after rifling through a case at the scene of the crash

Mr Mayne said: 'It’s sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy.

'It's
 really hard for us at the moment. The magnitude of it all and the way 
it happened. You don't think this sort of stuff happens to you.

'We
 just want Richard to come home now, so we can say goodbye properly. We 
want to lay him in peace, see him one last time and give him a good send
 off.

'On behalf of our family, I totally denounce the practice of Sky reporters looking through the victims’ possessions.

'I
 really hope Richard's stuff isn't part of that but it's really not on. 
For all the families involved, they really should not be doing it.

'My mum and dad have had so much to cope with over the past few days as it is. They're sick of it.'

The
 report has so far sparked 110 complaints with television watchdog 
Ofcom, amid growing anger over the desecration of the crash site and 
allegations of looting by pro-Russian rebels.

Twitter users criticised Brazier yesterday and again today after he was back on television reporting - despite the backlash.

One 
Twitter user asked 'Why is Colin Brazier still on my telly?'

This afternoon Mr Cameron told the Commons: 'Having watched 
some of this absolutely harrowing coverage, there are moments when it's 
quite clear that people are leafing through personal belongings and 
suitcases in a way that's just completely inappropriate.

'That has mostly been the separatists
 that have been doing that but there have been occasions I think when 
mistakes have been made by members of the press.

'I think people have to understand 
that this is effectively a murder scene but also a scene where there are
 people's loved ones who they are desperately worried about and want to 
know whether they will be able to be brought home and people should 
behave in an appropriate way.'

Sky News reporter Colin Brazier was reporting from Donetsk this morning despite a row breaking out over footage of him sifting through personal belongings among the wreckage of Flight MH17

The report has so far sparked 110 complaints with television watchdog Ofcom, amid growing anger over the desecration of the crash site and allegations of looting by pro-Russian rebels

Brazier's actions has also sparked a furious response on social media - with one Twitter user asking 'Why is Colin Brazier still on my telly?', while others appeared to defend the veteran reporter

'Inappropriate': Viewers blasted the broadcast as Brazier lifted up items one by one including keys and a flask

Live on air: The reporter, currently based in eastern Ukraine, censored himself saying 'we shouldn't do this'

Sky News received complaints from viewers as Twitter users urging people to complain to Ofcom

Meanwhile BBC radio presenter Shelagh Fogarty 
said: ‘Sky!! Get your reporter to STOP rummaging thru the belongings at 
#mH17 crash site. “We shouldn’t really be doing this” NO S**T Sherlock 
!! Those items are essentially sacred things now for the relatives. Just
 appalling.’

Media professor Joe Watson called it a ‘horrible moment for journalism’.

A
 post by Joey Blower added: ‘Colin Brazier has interfered with a crime 
scene in the most distasteful manner. It must be investigated fully.’

Ofcom said there had been 110 complaints, relating to coverage on Sky News on 20 July from 12pm and throughout the day.

A spokesman added: 'These are being assessed. A decision has not been made yet as to whether there will be an investigation.'

Sky
 News has refused to say whether disciplinary action would be taken 
against the veteran reporter, or whether there are any plans for him to 
return.

In a statement they added: ‘Today whilst presenting from the site of 
the MH17 air crash, Colin Brazier reflected on the human tragedy of the 
event and showed audiences the content of one of the victims’ bags. 
Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on 
air.

‘Both Colin and Sky 
News apologise profusely for any offence caused.’ Brazier later gave a 
moving account of coming across scores of human remains at the site.

He
 said: ‘I’ve been walking around, coming across body parts all the time,
 many of them charred beyond recognition. Men, women and children, 
indeterminate frankly, you can’t tell. Very often you are looking at 
charred spines, that’s all that’s left.

‘It is a truly macabre, horrific situation. There is a degree of anarchy and lawlessness.’

Several
 witnesses have reported seeing armed separatists rifling through 
possessions at the crash site and pocketing valuables, including 
electronic equipment.

Ukraine
 has also accused members of pro-Russian militia of stealing credit 
cards and has warned families of those who died to cancel their loved 
ones’ accounts.

Anton Gerashchenko, a government official in Kiev, said:
 ‘I have received information that terrorist death-hunters were 
collecting not only cash and jewellery of the dead passengers but also 
credit cards. My humble request to the relatives of the victims is to 
freeze their credit cards, so that they won’t lose their assets to 
terrorists.’

The crash scene
 was still not sealed off properly yesterday. Reporters continued to 
traipse over fields, while local residents wandered around like 
tourists.

Emotional: Families have issued pleas to officials on the site to return their loved ones' personal effects

Recovery: Identifiable bodies have been placed in refrigerated trains but belongings remain strewn about

Political: After three days of negotiations, Russia has agreed to hand over the black box and bodies

Some respectfully left flowers beside the broken suitcases and smashed computers that littered the landscape.

Many of the piles of possessions seen on Saturday, looted by officials on both sides of the conflict, had been moved again.

Among
 the small mementos of lives snuffed out were biographies of former 
football managers Kevin Keegan, Ron Atkinson and Brian Clough, laying 
beside a main road. There was speculation they could have belonged to 
the Newcastle United fans John Adler, 63 and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were 
killed in the disaster.

Elsewhere
 in the fields of wildflowers and rippling corn, sitting incongruously 
among aeroplane parts and electrical innards, were heartbreaking little 
pieces of evidence of the child victims aboard Flight MH17.

 girl’s ‘Secret Diary’ could be seen next to a tiny silver bracelet 
glinting in the sun and a packet of unopened Haribo sweets.
