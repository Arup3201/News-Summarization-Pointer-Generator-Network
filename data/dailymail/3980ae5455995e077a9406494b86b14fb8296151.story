Royal Air Force jets were deployed from Scotland to intercept Russian military 'Bear' aircraft that were flying too close to the airspace it guards.

Aircraft based at RAF Lossiemouth, based in Moray, were sent to identify the aircraft - Tu-95 Russian Bear H bombers - that were spotted in international airspace.

It was the first time a Quick Reaction Alert had occurred since the base took on the role of defending the UK’s Northern airspace.

The interception, which involved two Typhoon jets pictured, was the first time a Quick Reaction Alert had occurred since the Lossiemouth, Scotland, base had taken on the role of defending the UK's Northern airspace

RAF Lossiemouth’s Station Commander, Group Captain Mark Chappell, said the 'first successful launch' was what all the 'hard work' by the base had been for.

He said: 'The relocation of two Typhoon squadrons was a significant challenge, one that was met by our whole team.

'The many months of preparation and infrastructure improvements have made us absolutely ready for this launch, and shows we are in the best position to provide the service to the United Kingdom that the Royal Air Force was primarily created for - that is, the protection of our airspace.'

Royal Air Force Lossiemouth began a new era in its history on the 1st of September when it assumed the provision of what the RAF calls the ‘Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North’ task for the United Kingdom. The role is carried out by crews from 6 Squadron. 

The pilot involved in the mission called it a 'flawless scramble and execution' and said it was a milestone moment for RAF Lossiemouth

The pilot of the first launch, who has not been named, said 'it was an honour' to be part of the first alert, something he called a 'milestone in the history of RAF Lossiemouth'.

He added: 'The fact that we had a flawless scramble and intercept of two Russian Bears was a testament to the hard work and commitment of all personnel involved.

'A very proud moment, not just for the pilots who did the intercept but the engineering crews who did a fantastic job, as well as many other station personnel involved in this constant commitment.'

In June two Typhoon jets were scrambled into action to head off four separate groups of Russian aircraft that were flying near the Baltic.

The jets were deployed to ensure the Russian planes didn't enter the airspace of  Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia.

The Ministry of Defence said the aircraft appeared to be carrying out  a 'routine training' exercise in international airspace and were later escorted out of the area. 

That incident followed another where four Typhoons were sent to the Siauliai air base in Lithuania in May to support a Polish-led Nato force which was operating in the region.

That mission was a gesture by Nato following the Ukraine crisis.
