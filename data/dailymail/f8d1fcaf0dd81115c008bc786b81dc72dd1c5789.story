A pair of beguiling puppy-dog eyes is hard to resist.

But next time you think about sharing food with your pet, fight the temptation.

Some 85 per cent of pet owners feed their cat or dog human food, a study of 3,000 people by retailer Pets at Home found.

A third of families admit giving their pets fruit. But raisins or grape contain toxins that can cause kidney failure in both cats and dogs. In some cases, small dogs have died after eating as few as four grapes

Nearly two-thirds gave them cheese, which both dogs and cats struggle to process, while a third fed pets fruit.

But both dogs and cats can struggle to process dairy and the high salt content is also harmful.

Grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in pets, and in some cases small dogs have died after as few as four grapes.

One in 20 owners said they feed their four-legged friend chocolate. The treat contains theobromine, a chemical like caffeine, which can kill pets even in small doses.

The amount of the chemical in a bar 
varies depends on the type, with greater amount in dark chocolate, which
 has higher cocoa content.

Ten per cent admitted giving pets tea or coffee – but the caffeine can lead to heart palpitations and fits due to the caffeine content.

The most popular human food given as a snack is cheese, with nearly two-thirds of owners admitting to feeding it regularly to their pets. But both dogs and cats can struggle to process dairy and the high salt content is also harmful

Don't share your dinner with your dog

The survey of more than 3,000 pet owners was carried out by Pets at Home.

Commenting
 on the findings, Maeve Moorcroft, who is head of pets at the firm, 
warned that owners could be killing their cat or dog with kindness.

‘We’ve
 all been there, those big beautiful eyes can be hard to resist as we’re
 eating and it’s so easy to just share a little of your food. However, 
giving in to the longing and loving looks of our pets can actually 
really harm them,’ she said.

‘Their digestive system is extremely different from ours and they often have reactions to the food we eat. It’s best to stick to pet food and a diet recommended by an expert.’

The research also found more than a quarter of people give their pets biscuits, which could lead to obesity and a shortened lifespan.

Other foods given to pets included bread, roast dinners and crisps - all of which have no health benefit to pets and can cause digestive problems.

Almost half of dog owners admitted to giving their own food to their pet every day, whereas 56 per cent of cat owners did so at least once a month.

More than two-thirds of people gave shared their own meal with their pet, while 39 per cent of owners said their pets just help themselves to their meals.
