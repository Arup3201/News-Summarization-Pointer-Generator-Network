Jailed uncle: Drunk Clarence W. Hairston, of Pennsylvania, was arrested after allowing his eight-year-old nephew to sit on his lap and steer his car

An extremely drunk driver was arrested clutching a can of beer behind the wheel of his car while his eight-year-old nephew sat on his lap to steer.

Clarence W. Hairston, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, told police he was doing nothing wrong and 'was only letting the kids go for a drive' after the shocking incident on Saturday.

The 58-year-old caught the attention of officers after they noticed his blue Chevy Impala blocking traffic as it stopped in the middle of the street outside his home.

As they approached the vehicle, it began to make a series of 'stop and go' movements before narrowly avoiding a collision with a parked car, CBS Philly reports.

When police eventually reached the car, officers were stunned to find Hairston in the driver's seat with his eight-year-old nephew sitting on his lap.

Police say Hairston was operating the gas and brake pedals while drinking a can Bud Ice can.

Meanwhile, his nephew was manning the steering wheel, with another nephew, aged nine, sitting in the back of the car. 

When Hairston got out, he was said to be unsteady on his feet and have blood-shot eyes and slurred speech while also smelling strongly of alcohol.

After claiming to have done nothing wrong, he then suggested he was also a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, telling officers 'it's not right to jam up another cop'. 

It is believed Hairston was supposed to be babysitting his nephews, who were both returned to their mother unharmed.

Upper Darby Police Superintendent, Michael Chitwood, said: 'I would have rather seen the kid take the car and drive away. 

'Not only could he have endangered those two children in the car who apparently were his nephews but he could have endangered an entire community.' 

A woman who calls herself Hairston's fiancée has disputed the police's version of events, claiming he would never have put his nephews in danger. 

He is now facing a long list of charges that include driving under the influence, endangering the welfare of a child, recklessly endangering another person and permitting unauthorized person to drive and public drunkenness.

He remains behind bars with a $15,000 cash bail.
