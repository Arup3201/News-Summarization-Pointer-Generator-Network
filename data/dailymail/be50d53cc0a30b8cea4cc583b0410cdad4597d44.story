They've been employing a recent display of frugality, in keeping with the scale of the economic crisis facing Spain.

And it seems the Spanish royal family's new austere stance isn't about to change - even for the most important event in the past 40 years. 

Although plans have not yet been announced, it appears that the imminent coronation of Prince Felipe could also be a 
rather modest affair.

Crown Prince Felipe of Spain and Princess Letizia of Spain visited a students' residence in Madrid earlier today, as news emerged of the low-key scale of the king-in-waiting's plans for an austere coronation

The event, which is understood to be taking place on June 19, will be a secular event and will instead
feature just a simple proclamation, as well as a military procession, in front of 
Spanish politicians.

Palace and government spokesmen have already said
 no foreign dignitaries will be invited to the ceremony, largely 
due to the late notice given to plan the event.

Even Prince Felipe’s father, King Juan Carlos, has signalled he does not intend to be at the ceremony to see his son take over his throne.

But
 fervent royalists have attacked the plans, saying a low-key affair 
would waste a rare opportunity to showcase Spain on the global stage.

Monarchist
 newspaper ABC said the austerity policy threatened to tarnish the 
handover, claiming in an editorial: 'Unless we see a sudden change in 
strategy that could save the celebration, Spain looks set to miss out on
 an historic opportunity to project its image abroad.'

Political 
leaders are also said to be trying to persuade the royal family to 
change its mind about the foreign dignitaries, although observers say it
 has probably been left too late.

But a palace spokesman said there would not be room in parliament for an extended guest list, saying: 'We aren’t going to make people come just to leave them outside.'

It
 is believed the steps are being taken at the request of Prince 
Felipe, who wants a smaller celebration than that of his father King 
Juan Carlos, who was crowned four decades ago after the death of 
dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975.

It is the third time in as many days that the heir to the throne and his glamorous wife have been pictured at public events, showing they are ready for the coronation, which is due to take place next week

It seems the king-in-waiting has made the
 request out of awareness of the economic crisis devastating the 
country, as well as weekend 
republican protests in several parts of the country.

But despite the lack of ceremony around the occasion, it is expected that the new king and his wife Letizia will present themselves to the public from the balcony of the 
official Royal Palace in Madrid after the event.

King Juan Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia did the same after the coronation in 1975.

It is thought the couple will then embark on a royal tour of foreign nations, beginning with Spain's neighbours Morocco, Portugal and France.

When Juan Carlos was sworn in a king, pictured above, it was a much larger affair than what is expected from the imminent coronation of Crown Prince Felipe, pictured third from right as a young boy. The event included a mass after the coronation which is not expected to be held this time around

But despite the planned low-key nature
 of the event, the king-in-waiting and his wife have been putting in 
several public appearances over the past few days to prove they are 
ready for the statesmanship that awaits them.

Princess

 Letizia of Spain has oozed class at 
three different events in as many days, including a visit to student 
residences today in Madrid, Spain.

The princess and her husband also joined
 the royal family at a lavish gala dinner on Tuesday, as part of celebrations to 
welcome the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to Spain.

After that, they 'dressed down' to receive members of the Patronage of the Prince of Asturias Foundation at the Royal Palace in Madrid.

King Juan Carlos of Spain, who has been on the throne for nearly 40 years, announced last week that he was abdicating

She had
 already spent the afternoon networking, at a reception hosted by King 
Juan Carlos for the arriving president on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, in Madrid.

The events, although arranged to welcome the Mexican president to Spain, were a chance for Princess Letizia to publicly show her support for her husband.

King Juan Carlos of Spain announced last week that he planned to end his four-decade reign in favour of his 46-year-old son.

And earlier today, the Spanish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of urgent government legislation allowing King Juan Carlos to abdicate and hand over his duties to Crown Prince Felipe.

The shock decision to end his 39-year reign came days after it was
 claimed Carlos told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not
 want his son to ‘wither’ and ‘grow old waiting for the throne like 
Prince Charles’.

In a 
televised address, the 76-year-old said he 
wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger 
generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm.

According
 to reports in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time 
was right to pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young 
man.

‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household.

Prince Felipe and his wife Princess Letizia were seen at a reception for the Mexican president as well as a royal gala dinner earlier this week as they prepare for their new roles as state heads of the country

The private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year.

However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for political reasons.

The monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory.

In 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless.

Prince Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne.

He became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952.
