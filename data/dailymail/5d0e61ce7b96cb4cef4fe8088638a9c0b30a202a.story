The driver of a 130ft-tall cherry picker was killed today after he was thrown from the cab onto a motorway when the machine suddenly toppled over.

The cherry picker was being used at a depot yard situated next to the M25 this morning when the machine tumbled onto the hard shoulder of the anti-clockwise carriageway, throwing its operator onto the road.

The motorway was closed to allow 
an air ambulance to land and paramedics to attend to the injured man, who worked at the Kimberley Access depot in Iver, Buckinghamshire, but he was pronounced dead at the 
scene.

Incident: A cherry picker being used in a depot situated next to the M25 collapsed on to the hard shoulder, throwing its driver on to the motorway at 9.20am this morning

Tragedy: The man, who is believed to have been thrown from the cab of the crane, died at the scene

Smash: The cherry picker is said to be 130ft tall and fully extended when it toppled over on to the motorway at around 9.20am this morning

Investigation: A Health and Safety Executive investigation has been launched into why the machine apparently malfunctioned

A  worker at a neighbouring business 
said: 'We understand that it was a new machine so there must have been 
something mechanically wrong with it.

'The cherry picker was 130ft tall and it was up in the air when it has appeared to have toppled over onto its side.

'It
 has gone through part of their yard, part of our yard, across a service
 road where a lorry was parked, over a fence and into the motorway.

'The area is cordoned off and the road is closed.'

The
 hard shoulder and the inside lane of the motorway remained closed for 
several hours following the incident shortly after rush hour at 9.20am 
this morning.

Long tailbacks of up to two hours were 
being experienced by motorists in both directions of the M25 between 
junctions 16 and 15, near Heathrow airport.

On Twitter Stuart Dent said: 'Passed a 
corpse on the M25 not long ago. Poor bloke was in a huge cherry picker 
which had collapsed, chucking him onto the motorway.'

A police and Health and Safety investigation was launched into why the machine suddenly malfunctioned.

A policewoman looks at where the crane has ripped through the fence ringing the depot: Police were today in the process of contacting the as yet unnamed man's family

A spokesman for Kimberley Access confirmed that an accident had taken place but declined to comment further.

The
 company, which has depots across the country, has been trading since 
1994 and states that they 'specialise in nationwide access platform hire
 as we believe that access platforms are the safest way to work at 
height' on its website.

Today a spokesman for Thames Valley 
Police said the machine's driver was pronounced dead at the scene 
adjacent to the yard in Palmer's Moor Lane, Iver, Buckinghamshire.

He was not struck by any of the cars travelling on the motorway at the time of the incident.

The
 police spokesman said: 'We got called to reports of a cherry picker 
which had been working at a depot next to the motorway had fallen onto 
the hard shoulder.

'The man who was believed to have been on the cherry picker had gone over with it.

'A police investigation and a member of the Health and Safety Executive investigation are both under way.'

Pinned: The cherry picker fell across a lorry parked up at the side of the access road beside the depot

A spokesman for the Highways Agency add: 'The incident involved a crane - in a yard next to the M25 - which fell on to the hard shoulder of the motorway this morning.

'Once any necessary investigations at the site are complete, the crane will then need to be removed from the hard shoulder before the road can safely be re-opened to road users.'

Police were in the process of contacting the unidentified man's family.

His body was being taken to a hospital where a post mortem examination would be performed in the next few days.

An inquest would then be opened and adjourned until a future date.
