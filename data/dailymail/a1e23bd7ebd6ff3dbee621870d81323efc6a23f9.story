Two white police officers who were fired for slamming a black woman's head into a counter in custody will not face criminal charges - after a grand jury decided to clear them. 

Ricky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham were caught on camera in June 2013 brutally manhandling Keyarika 'Shea' Diggles, 25, in Jasper County, Texas, after she had been arrested for an unpaid traffic ticket.

They are seen coming at her from behind, bashed her forehead on the desktop and then dragging her off to a dark 'detox' cell with her handcuffs on.

Ricky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham were caught on camera in June 2013 slamming the head of Keyarika 'Shea' Diggles, 25, into a counter in Jasper County, Texas. They have been cleared of criminal charges

Diggles was on the phone to her mother when she was manhandled by the officers. She had only been arrested and taken to custody for an unpaid parking ticket 

The pair were sacked from the force following the incident but almost 18 months later, they have both avoided an indictment.

The revelation follows the decisions not to charge the police officers involved in the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner. 

News that they would not be indicted sparked protests against police brutality around the country. 

Cade Bernson told My Fox Houston the decision was appalling.

'I think it sends a terrible message to the public,' he said. 'It sends a terrible message to minorities and women that the law doesn't seem to apply equally to civilians as it does to police officers.'

The victim was on the phone to her mother, asking for $100 to cover an unpaid fine, when one of the officers cut off the call.

Diggles then starts to remonstrate with Grissom, Officer Cunningham comes from behind her and attempts to handcuff her, but not before he pushes her forward and slams her head onto the countertop. 

Grissom and Cunningham were fired from their jobs following the incident 18 months ago, but a grand jury has decided not to indict them 

The two men then wrestle Diggles to the floor before dragging her by her ankles into a jail cell. At one point Officer Cunningham yanks Diggles' shoe off her foot - causing him to loose his balance and fall onto the floor unceremoniously. 

Initially, Diggles was charged with resisting arrest but that was dropped on the Monday following the ordeal according to Bernsen.

Diggles settled a civil rights lawsuit against the city and the officers last December for $75,000. And less than a month after the incident, Jasper’s city council voted to fire Cunningham and Grissom. 

Both Cunningham and Grissom have refused to comment on the matter.

Their firing came 15-years since another hate crime in Jasper, which is a town of 8,000 people two hours northeast of Houston.

After Diggles fell to the ground, the pair dragged her to a 'detox' cell while she was wearing her handcuffs

In 1998, James Byrd Jr. was tied to the back of a pickup truck by three white men and dragged for miles until he was decapitated.

There followed clashes between the New Black Panthers and the Ku Klux Klan.

In 2012, the majority white Jasper City Council fired the town's first black police chief after 16-months.

A call by the station to Jasper County District Attorney was not returned.
