The father of a 7/7 terror attack victim whose phone was hacked by the News of the World accused Labour yesterday of being ‘steamrollered’ into shackling the Press.

Graham Foulkes, whose son David, 22, was killed by a bomb at Edgware Road tube station in 2005, accused Hacked Off of hijacking the phone-hacking scandal for its own reasons and said the group is ‘not representative’ of the victims.

Mr Foulkes was told by police in 2011 that his voicemails and those of his son were accessed on the day of the attack by a private investigator working for the now defunct Sunday tabloid.

Hacking victims: David Foulkes, right, who was killed in the 7/7 bombings in 2005, had his voicemails hacked on the day he died but his father Graham Foulkes, left, says Hacked Off is 'not representative' of victims

He and his wife decided not to sue News International for compensation. He insists the wrongdoing was already covered by the criminal law.

Mr Foulkes, from Oldham, said: ‘The fact is, phone hacking and bribery of officials is in itself a criminal offence. It is being dealt with in the criminal courts. Any law that says it’s against the law to break the law is just a nonsense.’ 

Labour leader Ed Miliband was ‘shameless’ in allowing Hacked Off, the celebrity campaign group fronted by Hugh Grant, to be involved in the late-night deal struck between the parties last week on Press regulation following Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry, he said.

‘They are a pressure group. They are not representative. Hacked Off became a major force and have swamped the media with their version of events and what they think should happen.

‘Hacked Off seem to have cosied up to the Labour Party to such an extent that we can’t distinguish between them. The parties have used Leveson as a cosh to beat each other with.

‘What concerns me greatly is that this crucial issue of freedom of the Press is being steamrollered through. It’s happening because of the political pressure rather than a desire to do the right thing.’

While he had initially welcomed the Leveson Inquiry, thinking it would help ordinary people, he said he thought the judge had ‘lost his way’ once celebrities became involved.

Mr Foulkes said he had emailed Culture Secretary Maria Miller to say that Hugh Grant’s experience did not reflect that of ordinary people caught up in the scandal. He asked to meet her but was told she was not available.

The imprisonment of former Liberal 
Democrat MP Chris Huhne and the MPs’ expenses scandal were examples of 
how the Press could hold politicians to account, Mr Foulkes said.

‘I’m really concerned that Hacked Off have created a head of steam with quite a high emotional content and the parties have got suckered into this.

'It would be a dark day when politicians are allowed to interfere with the freedom of the Press.’

When he gave evidence to the inquiry last year, he expressed his fears at the Government having a ‘knee-jerk reaction’ and imposing ‘overly restrictive codes of practice on solid, important journalism’.

Shameless: Labour leader Ed Miliband allowed Hacked Off, fronted by actor Hugh Grant, into the late night deal between political parties on press regulation

He said: ‘We’ve seen many examples where journalists have brought terrorists, murderers and criminals to justice where the police have failed.’

Mr Foulkes told how for six and a half days after the 7/7 attack he and his family had tried to phone his son, who would have been 30 yesterday.

‘If they [the News of the World] were listening to those phone calls that’s absolutely disgusting’, he said. ‘They broke the law, and when the law is broken there should be punishment. I don’t want to accept a cheque from News International.’

Hacked Off said most of its members were not celebrities.
