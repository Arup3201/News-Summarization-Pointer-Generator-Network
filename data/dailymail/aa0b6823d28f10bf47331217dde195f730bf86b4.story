Menace: Shermya Pyatt, 19, was jailed for 22 months for headbutting and robbing a 14-year-old boy of his bicycle

A teenaged mugging victim helped get his  female attacker jailed after he tracked her down through Facebook.

Shermya Pyatt, 19, headbutted the 14-year-old boy before stealing his bike in the robbery.

But her victim turned detective and with the help of his friends found Pyatt on Facebook after hearing her accomplice yell her distinctive name.

He passed on her details to police and she was jailed last week for 22 months.

The
judge praised the boys and said they were ‘seriously smart’ to use the 
social networking site to identify her, before passing the information 
on to the police.

Leicester
Crown Court heard the mugging happened when Pyatt, and an unknown man, 
approached the boy and his friend.

The unidentified accomplice grabbed the youngster and knocked him off his mountain bike.

Pyatt, from Leicester, then headbutted the young boy before she fled with the mountain bike at 8.20pm on September 17 last year.

She was branded a ‘violent bully’ as she was caged.

Judge Simon Hammond said: 'This defendant is a street bully. There’s a nasty, violent streak in her.

'People are entitled to go about their lives without people robbing them.

'The bike was probably the victim’s most treasured possession. He never got it back.'

Threat: Shermya Pyatt, 19, was tracked down thanks to the detective work of her victim, 14, who overheard her unusual name being shouted by an accomplice during the attack

Pyatt, who also admitted failing to answer her bail, was arrested nearly two months ago and has been in custody since the attack.

Lynsey Knott, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant got on the bike and the victim took hold of the handlebars, trying to stop her.

'She head-butted him on his nose and left cheek area, causing him to let go and she rode away.

'The complainant was in immediate pain and it really hurt him.'

Thug life: Shermya Pyatt, 19, was branded a 'violent street bully' by a judge at Leicester Crown Court

Clue: The 14-year-old victim heard an accomplice call his attacker's distinctive name after being set upon in this car park near Tudor Road and Kate Street in Leicester

The court heard she had received a reprimand and two police warnings for three assaults in 2006.

In March, 2010, she was prosecuted for possessing an imitation firearm, a BB gun, in Highcross shopping centre in Leicester and in July, 2010, committed a shoplifting offence.

Sally Bamford, mitigating, said she had shown remorse for her actions.

'There are positive aspects to her character and she comes from a good supportive background,’ she said.

'Her mother is in court to support her.

'The offence must have been extremely unpleasant for the victim, but fortunately there was no lasting injury.'
