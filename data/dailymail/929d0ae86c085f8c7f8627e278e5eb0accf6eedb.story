An actor who appeared in classic gangster films such as 'The Godfather Part II' and 'Goodfellas' sued a local deli in El Cajon, California, accusing them of stealing his name and likeness to promote an Italian-style sandwich.

Frank Sivero, 62, who played the characters of Genco Abbandando in 'The Godfather Part II' and Frankie Carbone in 'Goodfellas', sued the deli and its owners in Los Angeles Superior Court last week.

The dispute centers on the deli's use of his likeness in promotional materials, as well as the 'Frankie Carbone' sandwich the deli sold.

According to Sivero, he visited the deli in early March of last year, and agreed to take pictures with patrons after his meal. A few months later, Sivero claimed that he was tipped off that the deli posted his pic on their website, as well as their Facebook and Yelp pages.  This in addition to naming a sandwich after him.

In the complaint, Sivero sued Deli Belly, as well as the owners Robert E. Bahri and Vinson N. Gaggo. Sivero alleged that he never gave the partners permission to use his likeness in their ads, and that he was never paid for it.

According to the complaint, 'Plaintiff has developed and cultivated [his] rights to create 
universal recognition and value. Defendants have, without any right, 
title, or authorization, misappropriated and infringed on plaintiff's 
rights for the aforementioned commercial purposes.'

Sivero is seeking an injunction on the deli using his name and likeness, in addition to compensatory and punitive damages.

The owners of Deli Belly did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

Deli Belly's menu lists the Frankie Carbone, renamed the 'Frankie' on their website as of Sunday morning, consisting of  'Genoa salami, mortadella, hot cappy, deluxe ham & provolone cheese, 
lettuce tomato, onions, banana peppers, mayo & topped with Italian 
dressing on a sub roll.'

No pictures with Sivero could be spotted on any of their websites as of Sunday morning.

The deli is highly rated on Yelp, sporting 4.5 stars out of five with 48 reviews. One review, dated October 1, 2013, called the Frankie Carbone 'by far one of the top 3 Italian subs I've ever had!'

In the movie 'Goodfellas', Sivero's character was involved with a large robbery of the JFK Airport in New York. He is killed off by Robert De Niro's character James Conway, and they find his body inside of a meat locker, where he is so frozen it takes him 'three days to thaw out for the autopsy.'
