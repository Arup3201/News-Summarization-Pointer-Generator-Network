Federal authorities are investigating several threats made against the family of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who has been lauded as both a hero and a traitor since he was released by the Taliban in Afghanistan in a controversial prisoner swap that freed five suspected terrorists who were being held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Officials won't describe the nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made.

Bergdahl's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed.

Threats: Federal authorities have confirmed that threats have been made against Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani following their son's controversial release

Moment of release: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was shown struggling to adjust his eyes to the light at the moment he was released in a video released by a Taliban website. Former colleagues accused him of being a deserter

'We are working jointly with our state and local 
partners and taking each threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William 
Facer told CNN in an e-mail on Saturday.

The threats come in the wake of controversy 
coming from the families of soldiers who were killed while supposedly 
looking for Bergdahl, who is said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by Taliban forces in 2009.

The family also was the center of controversy after Bob Bergdahl thanked Allah during the White House announcement about Bergdahl having been freed.

Critics of Bob Bergdahl say the Taliban was 'thrilled' when he 'claimed the White House for Islam' by thanking Allah in his press conference with President Obama, it has been claimed.

The father of the freed
 soldier - who former colleagues claim was a deserter - said he was 
speaking Arabic and Pashto because his son's English was poor after five
 years in captivity.

But 
commentators accused him of giving the Taliban a priceless propaganda 
tool, with one saying extremist sources in Pakistan were delighted.

Mr Bergdahl spoke at the White House after 28-year-old Bowe - the only American prisoner of war in Afghanistan - was freed in exchange for five Afghan detainees held by the U.S.

Introduced by the President in the rose garden, he spoke mostly English with some Arabic and Pashto.

'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said.

'I'm your father Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same.

'To
 everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American 
government and international governments around the world, thank you so 
much.'

The Arabic phrase bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the Koran and means 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful'.

Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news network TheBlaze, said her Taliban sources were 'thrilled' at the phrase being used.

Swap: Sgt Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to U.S. special forces in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees

Emotional: Bob and Jani Bergdahl wept as they spoke of their love for their son in another press conference

Accusations: Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for TheBlaze, said the Taliban was thrilled

She told TV commentator Glenn Beck, who founded TheBlaze: 'He definitely was, in a way, consecrating the area.

'He was reaching out. It's an Islamic phrase... And when I contacted my sources in Pakistan who have direct links with the Taliban, they were actually thrilled, the Taliban was actually thrilled that the father did this.'

She added: 'This is incredible, he's gone way way beyond just a father reaching out to his son.

Divisive: Bob Bergdahl said he studied Arabic to understand his son's captors

'He’s actually putting so many lives in danger, and he’s giving a propaganda tool to Mullah Omar, who is the leader of the Taliban who the U.S. has been looking for for years.'

Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech.

After his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar.

He said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language.

'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.'

Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child?

'Bob and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, I'm sure.'

Yesterday a public homecoming parade for Bergdahl featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King was abruptly cancelled in his tiny hometown of Hailey, Idaho.

The official reason given was a concern for public safety - but MailOnline learned that a row erupted between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and former US Army Platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in the town.

In
 an email to Mayor Haemmerle, who wanted to hold the celebration, Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the 
community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe 
Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so.

Political firestorm: Senator John McCain - who was a POW for more than five years in North Vietnam - speaks to reporters yesterday. President Obama has been accused of putting a price on an American life

'It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held.

‘It would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to, in any way, heap undeserved adulation on Bergdahl, or to adopt the sickly hue of ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions.’

He added: ‘Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause. For now, the only appropriate response is silence.'

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel phoned Bergdahl's family yesterday to update them on his condition.

In the 10-minute call Hagel wished the family well and told them the Defense Department will continue to support the soldier's medical care, along with the process known as reintegration.

An official said Bob and Jani Bergdahl expressed their gratitude.

Earlier Wednesday, Hagel told reporters that the rush to judgment about Bergdahl is 'unfair' to his family.

Footage: A video on the Voice Of Jihad Website was confirmed to show Sgt Bergdahl on the day he was freed

Released: Since he was taken back by the U.S., Bergdahl has been in debriefing with military psychologists

To freedom: The soldier was shown in the video being patted down by his own colleagues before boarding

The POW's exchange for five Guantanamo detainees has provoked a storm of controversy.

Many accused President Obama of negotiating with terrorists and allowing a clear price to be set on an American life.

And
 while the soldier has been hidden from public view, being debriefed by 
military psychologists, many of his former colleagues have accused him 
directly of desertion.

Some claim six servicemen died in the search for the POW, and a Facebook group called Bowe Bergdahl is NOT a hero! has attracted more than 13,000 members.

Its description reads: 'Bowe Bergdahl has been made out to be a hero, deserving of praise.

'However, the media and government have lied to the public and covered up the facts.

'I and many of my former battle buddies have first hand knowledge of what took place on that hill in Afghanistan.

'We are here. We will be heard. Bergdahl will be held accountable for his actions.'
