England seamer Stuart Broad believes Kevin Pietersen's sacking last year was 'unnecessary' and the maverick batsman should have been dropped for a lengthy run of poor form rather than for misbehaviour.

Broad also appeared to set himself apart from the England management by saying the situation could have been handled differently.

Pietersen's international career was brought to a juddering halt by the ECB last February in the fallout of the Ashes whitewash defeat.

But Broad thinks Pietersen's indifferent form when he averaged under 35 in his final 12 Tests meant he could have just been dropped.

'It just became a bit of a media uproar. The whole sacking, it just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player in the history of the game just gets dropped for poor form,' Broad said in an interview on Radio 5 Live.

'His form was pretty poor over 18 months, every other player just gets dropped. Obviously Kevin's very disappointed . . . it could've been handled very differently, I think, by everyone.'

Pietersen's name continues to linger around the England team — despite him criticising team-mates, including Broad, and the ECB in his controversial autobiography — and the 34-year-old himself remains determined to resume his international career.

Yet Broad thinks that is unlikely due to Pietersen focusing solely on the Twenty20 format in the last 12 months, as well as the emergence of players such as Joe Root and Gary Ballance.

'He's not played any red-ball cricket for a year so I don't think a return in Test matches is very likely and he's not set the world alight in white-ball format either,' Broad added.

'The three Test matches we won in the summer against India were probably the strongest performances I've played in the 74 Tests I've played, and they were without Kevin Pietersen

'The guys who have come in — Joe Root, Gary Ballance — have been the shining lights of the England team.

'When you lose a great player, younger guys come in and perform, so actually if Kevin Pietersen was still in the side would Joe Root have taken the responsibility on this summer and averaged 99? Probably not, but he became the shining light of the England batting line-up.'

Stuart Broad was left red-faced on Saturday night after appearing to lose a bet to England team-mate Alex Hales and was forced to go to the cinema dressed in his full training kit.
