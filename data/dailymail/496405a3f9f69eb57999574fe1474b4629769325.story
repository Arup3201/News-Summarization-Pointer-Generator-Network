Pieter Schelte Hareema, a Dutch officer in the Waffen SS during the Second World War, who has had the world's largest ship named after him 

The arrival of the world's largest ship in Europe has provoked outrage after it was revealed it was named after a SS Nazi war criminal.

The Pieter Schelte, which is so big it can lift oil rigs out of the water, is docked in Rotterdam after being constructed at the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea.

It arrived in Holland just three weeks before the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and just days before four Jews were killed in a kosher supermarket during the Paris terror attacks.

But as Holocaust Memorial Day nears, anger has erupted after it was revealed Pieter Schelte Heerema was a Dutch officer in the Waffen SS. 

The vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jonathan Arkush told the Observer: 'Naming such a ship after an SS officer who was convicted of war crimes is an insult to the millions who suffered and died at the hands of the Nazis. 

'We urge the ship's owners to reconsider and rename the ship after someone more appropriate.'

The ship's arrival in Rotterdam has been trumpeted by energy company Royal Dutch Shell, which in a press release by Allseas confirms it will be one of the vessel's first clients. 

John Donovan, a former Shell contractor who has wrote a book on the company's relations to the Third Reich also told the newspaper: 'This public homage by Edward Heerema as the wealthy son of a Nazi war criminal is an affront to the relatives of tens of millions of souls who perished at the hands of Nazi Germany.'

Schelte was the father of Dutchman Edward Heerema, the owner of company Allseas, who commissioned the building of the ship. 

He was an officer in the Waffen SS during the Second World War, when he acted as a director for the Dutch East Company.

It is thought he was responsible for recruiting Dutch men to be put into forced labour in Nazi-occupied territories in Eastern Europe.

However, he is reported to have left the SS in 1944 as he lost sympathy with the Nazis and joined a resistance party, fleeing to Switzerland.

He was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for war crimes after the war but was released early and went to Venezuela  where he set up a engineering company.

He married his wife in The Hague during the war and was pictured wearing his SS uniform, with the ceremony attended by other high-ranking SS figures.

He was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for war crimes but was released early and went to Venezuela, where he set up a engineering company.

His namesake ship measures a staggering 1,253ft (382 metres) long and 407ft (124 metres) wide, making it almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall and wider than the height of Big Ben.

It cost £1.9 billion ($3.1 billion) to build and is powered by 11.2 megawatt engines connected to 13 Rolls Royce 5.5 megawatt thrusters.

Topsides - the upper section of oil rigs - weighing up to 48,000 tons can be lifted by the behemoth, while it will also be able to lift jackets - the legs - of rigs weighing up to 25,000 tonnes.

The ship can then transport both the top and bottom sections of the oil rig simultaneously and take it back to port.

It can even raise and lower itself in the water by 82ft (25 metres) in order to cope with the huge weight demands of moving an oil rig.

It can reach speeds of 14 knots (16.1 mph or 25.9 km/h) and has space for a crew of 571 people.

It will also be the world's largest pipelaying ship and will be used to construct infrastructure under the sea.
