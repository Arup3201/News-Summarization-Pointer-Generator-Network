'We are talking closely with the detention centre to figure out exactly how the escape transpired, said Ann Mathieu, a spokesperson for Sûreté du Québec.

'The priority number one is to find the helicopter.'

NBC reports that police are looking for a green helicopter with red and white markings that landed at the prison.

Quebec City, said Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said that she didn't know if it landed in a prison yard or outside a building nearby.

A lone pilot was believed to be in the helicopter when it arrived at the prison.

The Barrier Examiner reports that Pormeleau is the alleged leader of a narcotics network dismantled in 2010 in an operation called Project Crayfish.

Lefebvre and Denis are also allegedly part of the same network.

The escapees face charges of conspiracy and drug trafficking to name a few. 

A trial is scheduled to start in September and a pre-trial conference should begin on June 17.

All three inmates await a murder charge in connection with the death of Johnny Coutu in 2009.

This is the second time in jsut a little over a year that a helicopter was involved in a prison break.

In March of Last year at St-Jerome prison, a helicopter pilot was forced to release two prisoners at gunpoint.

The two suspects and escapees who hijacked the helicopter were caught just a few hours later.
