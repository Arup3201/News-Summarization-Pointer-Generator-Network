Talking shopping carts, free movie tickets and supermarket cooking classes are just a few of the latest recommendations the government is proposing to trim America's waistband.

The new proposals were detailed in an 80-page report released this month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is focused on the 42million Americans receiving food stamps.

However, it's uncertain if grocery stores will take up these new programs as First Lady Michele Obama is already coming under criticism for her health school lunches.

The new recommendations are designed to reward healthy eating and change supermarket layouts and programs to highlight more nutritional foods.

Talking carts: The USDA recently released a report this month which recommends grocery stores adopt new talking grocery carts that let shoppers know when they've purchased enough healthy foods. Above, healthy eating champion Michelle Obama pushing a cart at target in 2011

'Most Americans, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, do not purchase enough whole grains, dark green and orange vegetables, and legumes, and purchase too many items with excess calories from fats and added sugars,' the report said.

'At the same time, the food retail environment is saturated with food marketing messages, including health and nutrition claims and information, advertisements, and promotions for many unhealthy food items,' it added.

THE USDA first recommends that SNAP shoppers be rewarded for their healthy food choices with movie tickets or discounts.

SNAP shoppers will be helped meeting their healthy food quote with high-tech shopping carts.

These so-called 'MyCarts' Will be color-coded and physically divided by differently healthy food groups and notify when the shopper has enough to qualify for a reward.

'You achieved a MyCart healthy shopping basket!' it will say.

However, it's uncertain how willing grocery store chains would be to invest $30,000 into the carts per store.

Washington's Free Beacon used chain Safeway as example, which would have to spend $40.04million to install the carts in all of its 1,335 stores.

Other recommendations detailed in the report cooking classes held in grocery stores and employees who would act as 'ambassadors' to explain the different rewards programs.

'In this role, floor staff has the ability to re-direct consumer purchase towards more healthful choices by explaining the incentive or the nutrition labeling system,' the report said.

The USDA hopes to implement these programs in order to 'change the choice architecture of the food retail environment'.

It's uncertain how willing grocery stores would be to implement all of these programs into their stores, as first lady Michelle Obama is already receiving a lot of flak for her healthy school lunch program.

The first lady went on the offensive Friday as she hosted the Kids State Dinner at the White House today.

While congratulating the kid winners of a nationwide healthy recipe contest, Mrs Obama said their meals show that nutritious food has a place in school lunchrooms.

Mrs. Obama was alluding to a dispute she's currently in with the School Nutrition Association over new federal standards to make school lunches more nutritious.

The group says the rules are too strict. It wants Congress to relax them and a bill pending in the Republican-controlled House would do just that.

The first lady and the nation's agriculture secretary say many schools are meeting the standards and oppose softening the rules.

Mrs. Obama commented Friday at a White House 'state dinner' for the 54 winners of that national recipe contest.

Mrs Obama defended her health school lunches at the event, saying the winning recipes show that healthy lunches do have a place in school
