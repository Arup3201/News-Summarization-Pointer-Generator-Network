Isis today overran a cluster of predominantly Christian villages in Iraq alongside the country's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, sending tens of thousands of civilians and Kurdish fighters fleeing from the area.

Militants were seen pulling down church crosses and burning manuscripts during violence that has alarmed the Baghdad government and regional powers.

The mainly Christian town of Tilkaif, as well as Al Kwair, were overrun by militants, according to witnesses, and residents of Iraq's biggest Christian town, Qaraqosh, fled before the arrival of the Islamist fighters.

This advance brings Isis to the very edge of the Iraqi Kurdish territory and its regional capital, Irbil.

France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France was 'very deeply concerned by the ... seizure of Qaraqoush, Iraq's biggest Christian village, and by the intolerable abuses committed.'

He asked that the international community mobilizes itself against the threat and brings help.

The Isishas already seized large chunks of northern and western Iraq in a blitz offensive in June, including Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul. The onslaught has pushed Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops.

The al-Qaida-breakaway group since has imposed a self-styled caliphate in territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, imposing its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Iraqi government forces and allied Sunni tribal militiamen have been struggling to dislodge the Isis militants with little apparent progress.

Bishop Joseph Tomas, who is based in the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk, said the Isis pushed into Qaraqoush and four surrounding hamlets - Tilkaif, Bartella, Karamless and Alqosh - on Wednesday was in control of them on Thursday.

Kurdish peshmerga units, which had protected the area, fled along with civilians, Tomas said. Other priests contacted by The Associated Press, confirmed the information.

The raid started late Wednesday, and by 10 p.m., most Kurdish fighters had pulled out, said Father Gabriel, a resident of Alqosh.

The Christians and members of other minority groups ran for their lives, with tens of thousands heading to Kurdish northern Iraq, he added.

'All Christian villages are now empty,' said Bishop Tomas.

When Mosul fell into the militant hands, the Isis gave members of the many ethnic and religious minorities an ultimatum to convert, pay a tax or leave. Those who did not obey risked death.

The peshmerga units had initially managed to stall the militant advances, but their defense waned in recent weeks as the Isis group intensified efforts to expand its territory.

On Monday, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi air force to provide aerial support to the peshmerga, in a rare show of cooperation between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government that underscored the serious nature of this crisis.

In Batella, one of the hamlets overrun overnight, Kurdish fighters and local Christian security guards went knocking on people's doors, urging them to leave, said Um Fadi, who only gave her knickname, fearing for her own safety.

A government employee who fled from Mosul with her family for refuge in Batella more than two weeks ago, Um Fadi said she was in despair. 'Our situation is miserable,' she told the AP by phone on Thursday. 'We do not know what to do or where to go.'

The head of the Kurdish regional government, Nechirvan Barzani, urged Iraqi Kurds 'not to panic but to remain calm,' stay where they are and continue their 'normal work and life.'

Last week, the Isis also seized the northwestern town of Sinjar, forcing tens of thousands of people from the ancient Yazidi minority to flee into the mountains and the Kurdish region.

Pope Francis has called for world governments to take measures to protect Christians driven from their villages in northern Iraq and provide them with humanitarian aid.

In a statement, Francis appealed to the international community to 'put an end to the humanitarian drama underway, adopt measures to protect those who are threatened by violence and assure them necessary aid, especially urgent for those who are homeless and depend on the solidarity of others.'
