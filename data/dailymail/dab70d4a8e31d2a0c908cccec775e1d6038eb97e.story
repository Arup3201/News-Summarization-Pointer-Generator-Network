NHS England bosses insist that safeguards have been put in place to keep personal data safe, despite concerns from doctors and nurses

Health officials are to go ahead with a controversial plan to harvest the personal data of millions of NHS patients despite widespread concerns.

A pilot scheme involving 265 GP surgeries and 1.7million patients will see confidential medical information put on a giant computer database, it emerged last night.

The data, which includes childhood illnesses as well as recent conditions, will be uploaded unless a patient specifically opts out.

The highly controversial project was meant to begin last spring but officials were forced to postpone it following opposition from senior GPs and privacy campaigners.

Bosses at NHS England insist that over the past six months they have ‘listened carefully’ to the concerns of doctors and patients, and put in place safeguards to prevent data falling into the wrong hands.

But experts say the safeguards remain unclear and point out that the NHS has an abysmal reputation for losing patients’ medical data.

NHS England, backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, insists the data is hugely valuable and will identify poor care and possibly help find new cures.

Critics warn it could fall into the hands of hackers – or insurance firms who will use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain conditions.

There have been repeated complaints that information about how to opt out has been unclear. 

Despite this, the pilot schemes will launch in six Clinical Commissioning Groups local GP-led organisations – spanning West Hampshire, Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire, Leeds and Somerset. They will cover up to 265 surgeries and, given an average practice size of 6,500, nearly 1.7million patients.

Unless patients specifically opt out in writing or by word of mouth to their GP, their data will be uploaded automatically.

The information will include a patient’s date of birth, NHS number and postcode – but not their name.

However, experts say it would be very easy for hackers or private organisations to identify patients from the information stored.

Mr Hunt has promised that the data would not be shared with insurance firms for purely commercial reasons. But campaigners pointed out that a number of insurers also carry out research and analysis, so could use this to obtain information which could be used it to drive up premiums.

Over the next few weeks doctors in the pilot areas will contact patients by text, email or letter alerting them to the Care.data scheme and advising how they opt out. 

NHS England does not yet know when the full project will begin but it is likely to be within months. Last February – a month before the scheme was due to get under way – it called a temporary halt following fierce opposition from doctors and patients. 

Critics have warned that patients' data could fall into the hands of insurance companies, who will use it to drive up premiums, or could be accessed by hackers

Both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs said patients had not been given enough information as to how they could opt out.

A number of GPs were so opposed they automatically withdrew the thousands of patients on their books – and in so doing risking their surgeries being shut down.

They included Dr Gordon Gancz, from Oxford, who received a threatening letter from NHS England informing him his actions were in breach of his contract

Mr Hunt said in March that the database would be invaluable for identifying poor care and finding new treatments. ‘This is so important scientifically and this is going to save so many lives that it’s really important that we carry the public with us,’ he said.

But the NHS has an appalling reputation for mislaying data. Figures show there have been 2.1million breaches since 2011. These include computers containing medical records mistakenly being sold on eBay by hospital trusts and files being dumped in recycling bins.

Last night Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘If you have a mental health condition – for example depression – there is the potential for this to become public knowledge. 

'It could be hugely damaging for your reputation. Supposing you are a woman who had an abortion – if that got out it could destroy your career or relationship.’

Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential said: ‘The basis of the programme is unchanged – identifiable medical information will be extracted from the GP record of every man, woman and child in England. 

'This this data will be centralised and made available in various forms to an open-ended array of organisations and companies for ill-defined purposes.

‘It’s all very well to make promises, but patients must be able to trust those promises are true. NHS England cannot fudge what it says to doctors and patients, or it risks another crisis of confidence. We look forward to reading what NHS England are actually proposing.’

Tim Kelsey, NHS England national director for patients and information, said: ‘There are huge benefits to be had from this programme and this is our opportunity to make sure we get it absolutely right.

‘This is another step on the way to creating a more substantial picture of our nation’s health so we can improve care for patients.’
