Egypt's toppled president shouted angrily at a judge today as he appeared in court on charges of breaking out of prison in 2011.

Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted by the army in July, went on trial at a makeshift courtroom in a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo.

Dressed in a white prison uniform, he paced back and forth in a glass-encased metal cage, before shouting at the judge: 'Who are you? Tell me!'

The former Islamist president then told judges that he remains Egypt's legitimate leader, according to a state television reporter inside the courtroom.

He also expressed anger at being in a cage, raising his hands in the 
air and yelling in 
apparent disbelief: 'Do you know where I am?' - to which, judge Shabaan el-Shami responded: 'I am the head of Egypt's criminal court'. 

Morsi was among 22 defendants to go on trial at the academy, which is situated to the east of the capital. Others include members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, such as his supreme guide, Mohamed Badie.

The case is rooted in the escape of more than 20,000 inmates from 
Egyptian prisons
 during the early days of the 18-day uprising against  dictator Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders escaped two days after they were detained
 three years ago as Mubarak's security forces tried to undercut the 
planned protests.

At the time, authorities also cut off Internet 
access and mobile phone networks, crippling communication among the 
protesters and with the outside world.

Case: Dressed in a white prison uniform, Morsi stood in a metal cage with members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie. His appearance comes amid a wave of violent attacks on security officials

In aired edited footage of today's trial, defendants could be seen chanting that the case was 'invalid'.

They are also alleged to have turned their back to the court to protest
 their prosecution, according to the state television journalist.

Meanwhile,
 a prosecutor told the court that Morsi and the Brotherhood's acts 'were
 committed with the terrorist aim of terrifying the public and
 spreading chaos'.

He added that they had plotted with foreign 
groups to 'undermine the Egyptian state and its institutions.'

The trial coincided with the third 
anniversary of one of the most violent days of that revolution that 
plunged the country into prolonged turmoil, and that eventually led to 
the virtual collapse of the police and their withdrawal from the 
streets.

It is second time 
Morsi has appeared in court since the coup. At his first appearance in 
November, Morsi wore a trim, dark suit and appeared far less agitated, 
though he interrupted the judge and gave long speeches, declaring 
forcefully that he was 'the president of the republic'.

At
 the time, he had emerged from a four months detention in an undisclosed
 location, appearing in public for the first time since his ouster.

This time round, Morsi is being tried with a  total of 130 others -
 including dozens of members of the Brotherhood, the Islamist 
Palestinian movement Hamas and Lebanon's Shiite militant group 
Hezbollah.

The rest of the defendants are being tried in absentia.

Prosecutors say Morsi was freed from prison illegally during the 
2011 revolution, with help 
from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

They claim some of the defendants helped 
thousands to escape during the jailbreak - with others accused of 
murdering police officers.

The trial comes amid a wave of violent attacks on Egyptian security officials.

British 
holidaymakers have been told to stay indoors in Cairo after 80 
people died during a weekend of street protests and clashes.

Security teams said they were forced to fire live rounds on Brotherhood supporters as they tried to set up
 a sit-in in Cairo on Saturday.

A
 staggering 23 people died in the incident - 22 from bullet wounds - 
while five soldiers were also killed when their army helicopter crashed 
following a missile attack.

Meanwhile,
 on Friday, six people died in bombings that the Al-Qaeda-inspired group
 Ansar beit al-Maqdis claimed to have carried out. 

And in the latest in the string of attacks on officials, gunmen on a motorbike shot dead a police general in a west 
Cairo neighbourhood today.

General Mohamed Saeed was leaving his 
home when the criminals opened fire at him - shooting him in the 
head and the chest before fleeing, security officials said.

Candidate: The Islamist leader's trial also follows the Eyptian military's backing of army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah Sisi to run for the presidency. Above, an Egyptian woman holds a poster of al-Sisi

Gen Seed, the head of interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim's 'technical department', later died in hospital.

Morsi's appearance in court today is part of a relentless government crackdown on 
the ex-president and his Islamist supporters that has seen 1,400 people killed 
since he was deposed, according to Amnesty International.

Most of those killed have been pro-Morsi demonstrators in street clashes with police and the former president's opponents.

Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, is already on trial for
 inciting the killings of opposition activists during his presidency.

He also faces charges of espionage involving Hamas, with that trial due to
 open on February 16, and for insulting the judiciary, for which a date 
has yet to be set.

Although some of these charges carry the death penalty, the
 charges against Morsi in the current case carry a life sentence.

His trial comes a day after the Eyptian military's backing of 
army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for presidency.

Wildly
 popular for overthrowing Morsi, Sisi is now expected to resign as army 
chief and put himself forward as a candidate in the election scheduled 
to be held by mid-April.

A victory for the 59-year-old Sisi would continue a tradition of Egyptian presidents drawn from the armed forces.

To
 his supporters, Sisi is the best option for ending three years of 
instability following the 2011 uprising that ended the presidency of 
Hosni Mubarak, another former military officer.

On Saturday, 
thousands poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square to back Sisi's candidacy, 
after he said he required 'public demand' to stand in the election.

Today's trial has been adjourned until February 22.
