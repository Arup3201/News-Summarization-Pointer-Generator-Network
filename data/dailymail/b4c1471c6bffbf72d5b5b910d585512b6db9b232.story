Britain cannot afford to continue consigning millions of over-55s to the ‘scrapheap’, Iain Duncan Smith will say today.

The Work and Pensions Secretary will urge bosses to do more to keep older workers, saying there is no such thing as a fixed retirement age.

He will insist it is not in individuals’ interests to retire early, as an average earner ending work at 65 instead of 55 boosts their pension pot by 60 per cent and receives an extra £200,000 in income.

Over the next decade, the increase in over-50s is set to be five times greater than the fall in workforce, Mr Duncan Smith is expected to say.

‘Retirement age should be when someone chooses to retire,’ he will add. ‘What’s more, employers cannot afford to see their workforce decline. Far from throwing people on the scrapheap, we need people to help fill the demand for jobs and keep our economy growing.’

‘We must keep pace with Britain’s changing demographic, doing more to help people stay in work longer … through the right to request flexible working … or through championing new support to help people retrain and change career in later life.’

Government figures show one in four women and one in six men of state pension age have not worked since they were 55. Despite a rising number of older employees, ministers believe the number of older people out of work is a waste of talent and a missed economic opportunity.

The Government is planning measures to help older jobseekers, such as specialist support in job centres.

Mr Duncan Smith will also hail the flat-rate state pension, which is expected to be worth around £160 a week, from April 2016.

In the biggest shake-up since the state pension was introduced, the Government plans to link future pension age changes to life expectancy, so people spend only a third of their adult lives in retirement.
