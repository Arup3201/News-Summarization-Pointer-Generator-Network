A burglar has been caught red-handed after accidentally filming a break-in on his mobile phone.

Emmanuel Jerome, 23, from Newsome, thought he had switched on a torch on his iPhone during the night-time burglary.

Instead, he mistakenly recorded the raid on its camera device.

Mr Jerome, who was found guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary last month, was sentenced to 44 weeks in prison this week.

Judge John Potter was told that Mr Jerome still protested his innocence.

Mr Jerome was arrested after trying to break in to three other properties. Police then found video clips of a house in Marsh in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, which was targeted by a gang of burglars while the owners were on holiday. Property worth tens of thousands of pounds was taken.

Judge Potter told Mr Jerome: 'Significantly, in my view, camera footage of the invasion of that property was captured on your mobile phone.

'You, in my judgement, were an important member of the team that attacked that property on those occasions.'

Another member of the gang, Levi Castledine, of Oakes, is in prison following an earlier hearing.

Martin Sharpe, acting for Mr Jerome, said that although his client had previous convictions for burglary when he was a teenager, he had not committed similar offences for more than five years.

Mr Sharpe said Mr Jerome was married and that his wife was expecting their first child.

Judge Potter said that some of the burgled properties had been occupied at the time of the break-ins and property including cars, mobile phones and jewellery had been stolen.

He branded the burglaries "acts of selfishness".
