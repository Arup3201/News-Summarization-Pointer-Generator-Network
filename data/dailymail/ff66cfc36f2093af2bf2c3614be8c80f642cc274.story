The United States stormed to four Olympic gold medals in the space of 45 minutes - a sensational sequence of results which puts Team USA firmly back on-top of the London 2012 medal table.

Allyson Felix began the gold rush for the U.S. as she finally took gold in the 200 metres and was followed 16 minutes later by Aries Merritt who triumphed in the men's 110 metres hurdles.

Brittney Reese then bagged victory in the women's long jump 19 minutes after and a fabulous three-quarters of an hour was topped by the third consecutive Olympic beach volleyball gold medal for Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh-Jennings.

The victories for the American athletes helped the USA to top the medal table with 81 medals to China's 77.

Allyson Felix finally won an individual Olympic gold medal, gliding home with her seemingly effortless stride to take the 200-meters title and end Veronica Campbell-Brown’s stranglehold on the event.

Aries Merritt added to the perfect sprint night for the United States, dominating the 110-meter hurdles final ahead of compatriot Jason Richardson.

Behind them, Cuba’s Dayron Robles, the 2008 champion, was smashing a hurdle in frustration after he pulled up lame with a right hamstring injury halfway through the race.

In the heats, China’s Liu Xiang, the 2004 champion, also pulled out injured.

And making for a golden half-hour for the United States, Brittney Reese added the long jump title soon afterward to complete a triple for the Americans.

All of a sudden, the United States shot to the top of the gold medal standings in track and field with five titles, two more than Russia and Britain.

It could have been even better for the U.S. team, but world champion Lashinda Demus lost the 400 hurdles final by .07 seconds to Russia’s Natalya Antyukh.

In the biggest final of the night, loaded with gold medalists, Felix was quickest around the curve and, once she had her smooth, elegant stride going, none of the power racers could come close.

'I mean, finally. It’s been a long time coming,' said Felix, reflecting on two losses to Veronica Campbell-Brown.

'To twice lose to the same person, it’s been tough. But it’s all paying off.'

Misty May-Treanor danced on the sand and then off it, taking a victory lap around the court before leaving Horse Guards Parade with Kerri Walsh Jennings as the first three-time gold medalists in Olympic beach volleyball history.

Extending their Olympic winning streak to 21 consecutive games, Walsh Jennings and May-Treanor beat fellow Americans Jennifer Kessy and April Ross 21-16, 21-16.

The two-time defending champions fell to their knees and hugged as Ross' final serve went long on set point, then took the celebration to the stands.

May-Treanor then began doing a funky dance to rival the scantily clad cheerleaders who entertain the sold-out crowds and the Olympics' iconic venue during timeouts.

The winners then hugged their family and friends in the stands - but not May-Treanor's husband, Matt, a Los Angeles Dodgers catcher who was watching on a computer from the team's clubhouse - and high-fived just about everyone holding an American flag.

Even Ross and Kessy, who won a silver medal in their Olympic debut, have called their fellow Americans legends.

But they were hoping to supplant them as the top team in the United States by depriving them of another Olympic gold medal.

Instead, the Athens, Beijing and now London gold medalists remained unbeaten through three Olympiads, losing just one of 43 sets.

It was the Olympic farewell for May-Treanor, who has said she would like to have children.
