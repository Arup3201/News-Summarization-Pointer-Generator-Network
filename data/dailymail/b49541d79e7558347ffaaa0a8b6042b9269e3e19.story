Australia captain Michael Clarke has been ruled out of the rest of his side's triangular one-day series after suffering a recurrence of his hamstring injury in the shock defeat to Zimbabwe on Sunday.

The 33-year-old will return home to Sydney in order to have the problem assessed and it is likely his captaincy duties will be handed on to George Bailey, who took charge of Australia in their opening two matches of the series in Clarke's absence.

Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley said: 'Michael...will not be able to take any further part in the tri-series.

'Michael will return to Sydney on Tuesday to undergo scans and further assessment to determine the full extent of the injury.'

Clarke missed his side's matches against Zimbabwe and South Africa due to the problem with his hamstring and, playing in his first professional match since March, aggravated it while batting on Sunday.

He was forced to retire hurt on 68 and although he re-emerged for the closing stages of his side's innings, the injury is clearly a worry for Australia with the World Cup on home soil only a few months away.

The problem only compounds a frustrating day for the tourists, who suffered their first defeat to minnows Zimbabwe in 31 years after a three-wicket loss in Harare.
