Visitors to Disneyland Paris are being robbed of the chance to see their favourite cartoon characters because of on-going strike action over a sexual harassment case.

Staff who dress up as characters including Mickey, Donald Duck and Goofy are withdrawing from ‘Meet and Greet’ events.

They are furious that a senior colleague who was accused of harassing women had been allowed back to work because of ‘lack of evidence’.

There is also widespread anger at low wages, with strikes also being organised as part of a union campaign to get pay increases.

It all means that those visiting the theme park outside the French capital, including thousands of Britons, are left disappointed.

‘It’s worst for the very young children who aren’t that interested in the rides,’ said Louise Scott, a mother-of-four from Welwyn, Hertfordshire.

‘They dream of meeting their cartoon heroes, and want to be pictured with them, but there just aren’t any around.’

This week alone there have been cancellations of the Magic on Parade event, ‘Meet and Greet’ sessions in Cafe Mickey, the Cowboy Cookout Barbeque, and a number of other hugely popular events.

All of the characters come from the entertainment department at Disneyland, where an insider said: ‘We are all hugely professional, but have every right to go on strike if we believe that someone who should not be here is working alongside us. We also object to low pay.’

The Disney board in Paris argued that there was not enough evidence to incriminate the alleged sexual harassment offender.

It also denies that staff have the right to ‘opt out’ of their duties, and has pledged to impose harsh financial penalties on strikers.

Those caught up in the industrial action last month included hundreds of British families who experienced strike action in March.

‘It’s bizarre that Disneyland characters are going on strike,’ said Eileen Holmes, a 32-year-old mum from south London who was in Paris with her two young children.

‘You expect to see French lorry drivers and fishermen on strike, but not cartoon characters!’

David Charpentier, of the FO trade union, said: ‘It’s unfortunate, but we have to defend our rights as wage earnings.

We have offered a compromise to management, and it’s up to them to respond.’ Daniel Dreux, Disneyland’s human resources manager, said a ‘general increase of 1.5 per cent’ was on the table, and appealed for ‘realism and common sense’ from strikers.
