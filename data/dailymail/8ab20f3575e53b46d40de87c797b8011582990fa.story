A cemetery in Stafford has become the first in Britain to turn to so-called 'ready-made' plastic graves after it ran out of room to bury to dead.

Eccleshall Road Cemetery was forced to turn away  funerals after it used up all of the suitable land allotted for burials.

It is problem that has being felt around the country, with warnings earlier this year of a national shortage in grave space.

But an experimental new scheme that could now be used in cemeteries all over Britain has seen pre-dug graves  constructed out of plastic.

Workers install ready-made graves in Stafford after a cemetery ran out of room for more burials

The local council hopes the new system will stop graves subsiding in land previously thought too sandy

The move came after the cemetery ran out of the space to dig new graves and nearby land was considered too sandy to house long-lasting burial places.

The local council has now installed large plastic walls to create plots where coffins can be placed without the risk of subsidence.

New graves are made by digging a plot much larger than the standard burial with room for 12 bodies.

A giant frame is then put in place with walls installed on the frame to create individual plots measuring 9ft by 4ft.

The plot is then refilled, leaving one space unfilled ready for the next burial.

If more plots can be added on to the frame if required at a later date without disturbing those already resting.

The first plot was used for the burial of a man last Friday.

The area dug up was later covered, leaving pre-made graves, one of which has already been used

It is thought the scheme, which uses plastic frames like those pictured, may now be used around the country

While the installation does increase the cost of digging the graves, the council insists it saves money in the long term and increases the amount of available space threefold.

A spokesperson for Stafford Borough Council said they believed they were the first in the country to experiment with the new grave system.

The burial system could be rolled out to help extend the life of the other cemeteries, the spokesperson said. 

Local councillor Frank Finlay said: 'This gives the chance for those who would like their loved ones to be buried in this cemetery - something they may not have thought possible.'

In May this year, MPs warned that growing pressures on land for development and farming has left many local councils struggling to find space for burial sites.

Other cemeteries have built concrete chambers but this is the first time cheaper plastic has been used

The only land left was considered unsuitable because it was too sandy

It is hoped the new idea will open up more areas for burials and graves
