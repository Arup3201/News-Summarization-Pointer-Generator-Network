An investigation has been launched after £2million of taxpayers' cash was wasted on Beatles' memorabilia that was worth just £300,000.

A publicly funded travel firm in Liverpool handed over the huge sum for a pair of John Lennon's glasses and George Harrison's first guitar, plus nine other items in 2008.

Despite concerns over the valuation at the time, the board of Merseytravel agreed to the payment as part of a deal to buy the city's Beatles' Story museum from a group of London-based investors for £8million.

The collection, bought by publicly-funded Mersey-travel in 2008, includes these wire glasses worn by John Lennon during the recording of Imagine and the guitar George Harrison learned to play on

But - following an internal audit - it has since emerged that the memorabilia was, in fact, worth £1.7million less.

The
wire-rimmed glasses , which were apparently worn by Lennon when he 
wrote his most famous song, Imagine, in 1970, were valued as being worth
£1million alone.

Harrison's guitar, a brown six-string acoustic, which he learned to play on, was priced at £500,000.

Other
items in the Fab Four cache of memorabilia included studio notes 
written by their producer George Martin, believed to relate to the 
recording of 1965's In My Life, from the Rubber Soul album.

It
is understood lawyers instructed at the time of the sale had warned of a
potential 'conflict of interest' because the valuation had been made by
a business partner of the person who wanted to sell the memorabilia.

However,
such information was not passed on to councillors sitting on the board 
of Merseytravel and instead staff told the lawyers to proceed with the 
purchase.

Official documents state that 'both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance'.

Former
Beatles Story managing director Jerry Goldman said: 'There did not seem
to be any discomfort from the Merseytravel lawyers at the time.'

This guitar and the spectacles alone were said to be worth £1.5million but the whole collection has now be revalued at just £300,000

Auditors
for Merseytravel have since recommended 'a full investigation into the 
Beatles memorabilia valuation' and advised the authority to take 
'appropriate action.'

Merseytravel
chairman Cllr Liam Robinson said: 'We will look to take action if we 
establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time 
and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the 
original negotiation.

'From 
initial enquiries it does appear that elements of due process were not 
followed. This could not happen now. Our new governance and scrutiny 
processes would not allow it.

'It is a reflection of where Merseytravel was and not where it is now.'

Cllr
Robinson added: 'It is important to note that The Beatles Story is 
unaffected by this revaluation. It remains a profitable, first-class 
visitor attraction. It has had a bumper summer with visitor numbers up 8
per cent on last year.'

Merseytravel
is publicly funded via grants from central Government, the five local 
authorities in Merseyside and European funding.

The
Beatles Story opened in Liverpool's Albert Dock in 1990 and regularly 
attracts 300,000 visitors from all over the world each year.
