Australian NRL player Alex McKinnon who was injured in a tackle last week has been informed by doctors that he is a quadriplegic and may never walk again.

The 22-year-old Newcastle Knights forward had his neck fractured in a three-man tackle during a match against the Melbourne storm on March 24.

He has been in a medically induced coma and underwent an operation to fuse his C4 and C5 verterbrae, as well as having a bone graft from his hip to support his neck.

McKinnon was brought out of the coma on Sunday, and on Monday night doctors at The Alfred Hospital gave McKinnon and his family the devastating news that the young man will likely remain a quadriplegic, Nine News reported.

The Knights forward is now conscious and talking to his family, but remains in a critical condition with limited feeling in his left arm.

Newcastle Knights legend Matthew Johns told The Daily Telegraph about the devastation caused by the news in the rugby league community.

‘Everyone in sport, not just rugby league, are in total shock,’ he said.

‘It was always a chance it was going to be this type of terrible news but everyone was praying that it wouldn’t be. Then you get the news come through of this young boy, who is so universally liked and respected in rugby league, may not walk again.’

There have been a flood of tributes to the young player on social media, including one from Australian Test cricket captain Michael Clarke.

‘Devastating news about Alex McKinnon. Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this time,’ he tweeted.
