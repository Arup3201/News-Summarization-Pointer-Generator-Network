James Arthur Ray, pictured during his trial, said yesterday he wishes he could trade places with three people killed in sweat lodge at a retreat he led

A self-help author who led an Arizona sweat lodge that left three people dead said he wishes he could trade places with the victims.

James Arthur Ray was convicted on three counts of negligent homicide and served 20 months in prison until his release in July this year.

In his first interview since being freed he said he haunted by what happened.

The deaths occurred in 2009 after dozens of people traveled to a scenic retreat outside Sedona, Arizona, for his five-day 'Spiritual Warrior' event in which participants endured fasts and sleep-deprivation.

Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee died in the sweat lodge, which consisted of trees covered with tarpaulins and blankets over hot coals 

Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, slipped into a coma and died after more than a week in the hospital.

Eighteen others were injured suffering from ailments including burns, dehydration, breathing problems, kidney failure, or elevated body temperature.

Ray told CNN's Piers Morgan yesterday: 'If I could trade places with any of the three, James Kirby or Liz, I would do it.'

Ray made millions from his self-help business and as a motivational speaker and appeared on Larry King Live.

He says he has lost his fortune but insists 'hurting' people he had tried to help is more difficult.

He told CNN: 'It's just the antithesis of anything that I had ever stood for or wanted. And so that anguish has continued every single day since that moment.'

A further 18 people were injured in the sweat lodge that can be seen on the bottom left of this shot of the Angel Valley Retreat Center, near Sedona, Arizona

Participants paid more than $9,000 each to attend the retreat and the sweat lodge was planned as the highlight.

Ray acknowledged he was responsible for the deaths, but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded at the sweat lodge.

He and his attorneys maintained that he wasn't aware people were dying or in distress, or he would have stopped the ceremony.

Survivors said people were vomiting and lying unconscious on the ground.

The families of victims have spoken openly against Ray ever rebuilding his self-help business.

Ms Neuman's daughter Andrea Puckett previously said: ''Ideally, we don't want [Ray] doing anything in the industry anymore.

'I don't think he has the right to work with people. If he does move forward with that, I hope people become aware of what he did and he changes the way that he handles his seminars and his teachings.'

He has said he will not conduct a sweat lodge again but since his release has set up another self-help blog.

The self-described 'thought leader' wrote: 'The last four years of my life have been the most painful and difficult of my entire existence; and yet they’ve also been an incredible and amazing adventure.

'Sometimes you must experience something completely ugly to find the beautiful.'
