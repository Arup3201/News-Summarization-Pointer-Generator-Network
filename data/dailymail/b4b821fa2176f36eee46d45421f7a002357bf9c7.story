The planned documentary by the Oprah Winfrey Network on Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, has been postponed.

Erik Logan, president of the network, said Friday that the postponement was made after meetings with the St. Louis Rams.

'After careful consideration and discussion with the St. Louis Rams, "The Untitled Michael Sam Project" has been postponed, allowing Michael the best opportunity to achieve his dream of making the team,' Logan said in a statement.

In training: St Louis Rams rookie defensive Michael Sam during the NFL rookie camp Friday

From the football field to Hollywood: Michael Sam, the first openly-gay man to be drafted into the NFL, will be the star of his own reality TV show, Oprah Winfrey announced Wednesday

Cameras are rolling: The show has reportedly already started filming and crews were in the room when Sam got the call that he had been drafted and kissed his boyfriend in celebration

From the people that brought you 'Lindsay': The documentary series is being filmed by the same crew that followed Lindsay Lohan for her OWN reality show

The first openly gay football player to be selected in the draft was to be the focus of a new multi-part documentary series to air on Oprah's OWN network, produced by the same crew that filmed Lindsay Lohan's reality show.

'We are honored that Michael is trusting us with his private journey in this moment that has not only made history but will shape it forever,' Oprah Winfrey said in a statement.

'It's clear that we, along with the world, recognize the important opportunity that Michael now has in this moment. We will continue to support him in his journey to earn a spot playing for the Rams.'

As a seventh-round draft pick, Sam will face hefty challenges just to make the Rams. Being the subject of a TV documentary could have been a major distraction for the defensive end from Missouri.

Spotlight: Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano celebrated his drafting in Las Vegas this weekend. He has since flown to St Louis to begin training. It's unclear how much access the crews will be granted by the NFL or Rams

Hard road ahead: During his time at the University of Missouri, Sam was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year, but will likely have to train for a different position if he wants to make the Rams 53-man roster

'This (postponement) will allow for 
Michael to have a total focus on football, and will ensure no 
distractions to his teammates,' added Sam's agent, Cameron Weiss. 
'Everybody involved remains committed to this project and understands 
its historical importance as well as its positive message.'

The
 announcement that Sam was to participate in the show was somewhat 
surprising to some, since Sam said at a press conference that he just 
wants to focus on training.

When asked what it felt like to the the first openly gay draftee, Sam said simply: 'I guess it's great.'

'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added.

Shooting
 had reportedly already begun on the project, but it's uncertain how 
much access the NFL and Rams would grant production crews now that Sam 
is in training.

Sam was 
named SEC Defensive Player of the Year during his time at the University
 of Missouri, but is considered too small to be a defensive end in the 
league at six-foot-two and 261 pounds.

Most likely, he'll have to focus on learning a new position if he wants to make the team for the season.
