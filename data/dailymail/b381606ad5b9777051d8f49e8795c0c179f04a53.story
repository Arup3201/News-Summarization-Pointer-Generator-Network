Cosmetic surgery is soaring in China as women over thirty compete with younger talent in the workplace

There has been a surge in cosmetic surgery among Chinese working women due to employers placing undue emphasis on youth, according to a new report.

Daily Beast contributor Joanna Chiu has reported a boom in cosmetic procedures in the country, in particular among working women on the cusp of turning thirty who fear they may be overlooked in favour of 20-something colleagues.

Women feel job insecurity and anxiety more acutely than men, according to anthropologist Wen Hua.

And it appears their fears may well be grounded in reality: ageism and sexism appear to be endemic in the job market.

In 2003, a
 review of the country's job adverts revealed that over 90 per cent of 
job postings were only open to applicants under 30, while unmarried 
females over the age of 27 are labelled as 'leftover' women by the 
government.

Hua, the author of Buyings Beauty: Cosmetic Surgery in China, says that beauty is often viewed as the key to success in the workplace.

She said: 'The dramatic economic, cultural and political changes in China have produced immense anxiety experienced by women, which stimulates the belief that beauty is capital.

'Cosmetic surgery has become a form of consumer choice; it reflects in microcosm the transition of China from communism to consumerism with its own Chinese characteristics.'

But Hua goes on to explain that discrimination against older women doesn't discourage them from aiming high.

The results of a 2011 study by the Centre for World-Life Policy showed that 76 per cent of women aspire to top jobs, whereas only 52 per cent of women in the United States do the same.

And Xinhua News Agency found that these Chinese women fund a $2.5 billion a year industry, which is growing at a staggering 20 per cent per year.

After the U.S. and Brazil, China is ranked the third largest market for cosmetic surgery in the world.
