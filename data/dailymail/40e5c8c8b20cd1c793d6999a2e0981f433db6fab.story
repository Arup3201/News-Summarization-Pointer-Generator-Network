Curiosity is said to have killed the cat – and it nearly spelled the end for this puppy too.

Instead of simply snoozing on the sofa, seven-week-old Milo’s inquisitive nature got the better of him and he decided to investigate underneath it.

But to his owner’s horror, the tiny Staffordshire bull terrier cross became trapped in the reclining settee’s frame.

Jessica Marsden, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, whose puppy Milo got trapped in her sofa and needed the fire brigade to rescue him

Sofa shock: Milo the Staffordhsire bull terrier-cross got trapped in owner Jessica Marsden's settee

Miss Marsden said: 'It was like a scene from a horror movie. I was sitting on the stairs crying my eyes out. I couldn't look at him suffering'

Tearaway: Miss Marsden said: 'Milo's proved himself to be a bit of a handful so I've got my eye on him. He's even sleeping with me as I'm so worried he's going to get in trouble during the night'

He struggled to breathe, stuck between the metal bars, but owner Jessica Marsden could not move the sofa without injuring him.

Milo was eventually freed by firemen in a 30-minute rescue operation.

Miss Marsden, 17, had had the puppy 
for only a week before his mischievous streak got him in trouble. The 
hair and beauty apprentice said: ‘I thought he was going to die. I was 
looking at his little face, and he sounded in so much pain. It was 
heartbreaking.

Close call: Since the ordeal, Miss Marsden has taken delivery of a new 'dog-proof' sofa, and is keeping a closer eye on Milo

‘He was turning blue, and I thought I 
was losing him right in front of my eyes.’ Miss Marsden and her friends 
had been playing with Milo when he disappeared behind the sofa and did 
not come back out.

‘I started to worry when I heard a little cry coming from inside,’ she said.

‘We lifted up the back of the seat and could see his little head was trapped.’

After their attempts to move the puppy and the sofa failed, they called 999.

Around ten firemen arrived at the 
house in Huddersfield and used lifting gear and cutting equipment – more
commonly used to pull car crash victims from damaged vehicles – to free
the dog.

Hacksaws were used to cut the metal bars from beneath the sofa and painstakingly release the terrified puppy.

Miss Marsden said she could not bear 
to watch, adding: ‘I was sitting on the stairs crying my eyes out. I 
couldn’t look at him suffering.

‘I’ve not had him long, and I took him
in after his mother refused to feed him, so I weaned him on porridge, 
which I had to feed him by hand. I love him so much and I couldn’t bear 
to see him like that.’

The fire crew’s watch commander,  
Graham Calcraft, said he held Milo’s head while colleagues cut through 
the metal bars. ‘It was a delicate operation and I think at first his 
owner thought the dog had been impaled on the metal, but that wasn’t the
case,’ he said.

Miss Marsden said she is now keeping a very close watch on her pet, who has proved to be ‘a bit of a handful’.
