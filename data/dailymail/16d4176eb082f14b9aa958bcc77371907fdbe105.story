In the line of duty: Constable Dan Pascoe, 27, tackled a car thief

This is Police Constable Dan Pascoe - the hero policeman who was thrown through the air after a collision with a stolen car - before getting up to chase down the criminal on foot.

The officer had stopped his car on an M25 slip road in Surrey to block the blue BMW, but was sent flying through the air seconds later.

Constable Pascoe, 27, had got out the vehicle seconds before motorist Lee Adamson ploughed into his patrol car, throwing the policeman off his feet on to the Tarmac.

But undeterred, the brave constable 
sprang to his feet and chased down the criminal, who had abandoned the 
smashed blue stolen BMW and attempted to run away.

Pc
 Pascoe even managed to apprehend Adamson, 29, by sprinting after the 
criminal and Tasering him within seconds of the dramatic crash.

The
 extraordinary incident earlier this month was captured on camera by a 
second squad car parked metres behind Pc Pascoe's vehicle.

Adamson was today began a 23-month jail term after the crash on July 3.

He
 admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of an 
accident, driving while disqualified, driving without insurance and 
resisting arrest, and was jailed at Guildford Crown Court.

Surrey
 Police revealed that Pc Pascoe managed to chase down Adamson and stun 
him with an electronic Taser before himself collapsing.

The car thief was arrested by other officers soon after while Pc Pascoe amazingly suffered just minor injuries.

Offender: Lee Adamson, from Hayes, Middlesex, was jailed for 23 months after the extraordinary incident

Police pursued Adamson at speeds of up to 90mph before the crash, the court heard.

Adamson, who had 25 convictions for 53 offences, was on licence after being released from jail in March at the time of the crash.

Inspector Chris Colley, head of Surrey Police's Roads Policing Unit, said: 'I would like to praise the officers involved in this incident for the bravery and professionalism they demonstrated to react so quickly and make an arrest in such exceptional circumstances.

'The officers, particularly Pc Pascoe, had to react extremely quickly and despite the shock and possible injuries they may have sustained during the collision, they were determined not to let the suspect get away.

'Thankfully Pc Pascoe sustained only minor injuries as a result of the collision but it's clear that the extremely dangerous manner in which the stolen vehicle was being driven could easily have resulted in a tragic outcome.

'Adamson rammed the police vehicle at high speed and it is only good fortune that prevented an officer or a member of the public from being seriously injured or killed.

'I'm very proud of the actions of the officers involved in this incident and I'm sure the public will be heartened by the courage and desire they showed to go above and beyond to keep the people of Surrey safe.'
