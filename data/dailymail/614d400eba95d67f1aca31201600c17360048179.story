Tim Sherwood has reminded the football world his Premier League win percentage at Tottenham Hotspur is still superior to Mauricio Pochettino's ahead of his first match as Aston Villa manager.

The 46-year-old credited his Argentine successor for continuing to blood academy graduates, but said Harry Kane would not have been such a scoring success this campaign had Sherwood allowed the 21-year-old to go out on loan in January 2014.

The new Villa manager believes Christian Benteke can similarly improve under his watch, beginning with Saturday's visit of Stoke.

Mauricio Pochettino                  52%

Tim Sherwood                         59%

Andre Villas-Boas                     53.7%

Harry Redknapp                       49.3%

Juane Ramos                            28.57%

The match is Sherwood's first as a manager since Spurs beat Villa on the final day of last season to see him leave White Hart Lane with a 59 per cent top-flight win rate and his side sixth. Pochettino has guided Spurs to the same position with a 52 per cent win rate.

'The risk of failure at Tottenham was us dropping out of the Europa League slots,' said Sherwood. 'I don¹t think anyone¹s managed to better my win record, not even this guy Pochettino - and everyone¹s talking about how well he¹s done.

'I think he has done a really good job there, but mine¹s still up there to be shot at. He¹s inherited a good bunch of young players who were developed by myself.

'He¹s willing to play them as well, there¹s a lot of big stars there, he could have discarded (Ryan) Mason and (Nabil) Bentaleb but he¹s not done that so fair play to him. I respect him for that.

'You have to believe in those kids. If I hadn¹t resisted the club wanting to loan Harry Kane out last January, he wouldn¹t be the Harry Kane he is now.' On his Villa striker, Sherwood said: 'I don¹t think Christian thinks he¹s cracked it yet. He can go on and on, he looks like he has a real good desire to want to listen and improve.

'I know he was a beast up there and can bully people. I think he¹s a real good lad - he speaks better English than me as well!' 

Villa are 18th in the table without a win in 10 league games. 'I just need to do what I can do here,' said Sherwood. 'I know I¹m good enough to do the job, and I want that to sound confident, not arrogant. I just believe in my ability.'
