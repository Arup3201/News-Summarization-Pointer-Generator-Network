Surrey captain Graeme Smith will not be returning to the Oval next season due to his continued battle with injury.

The former South Africa skipper played just three first-class games for the county last season due to an ankle injury and was ruled out for the rest of this campaign after fracturing his knee in May, subsequently undergoing surgery to resolve the problem.

And now doctors have advised that Smith will not be able to 'fulfil the 
day-to-day duties of a full county season', with both parties agreeing 
to end his three-year stay a year early.

On his way out: Graeme Smith will no longer be plying his trade at the Oval

In action: Smith strikes the ball during a match between Surrey and Sussex in April 2013

'I thoroughly enjoyed the privilege of captaining Surrey but due to my injuries in 2013 and 2014 I have been unable to fulfil my role in achieving the goals that both Surrey and I set out to accomplish when I first arrived,' Smith told www.kiaoval.com.

'I would like to thank Surrey for the way they have looked after me. They have made me feel very welcome and it is very apparent that the current cricket management and personnel in the dressing room are already well on their way to achieving these goals.

'I will continue to follow the club's progress over the coming years.'

No return: Smith will leave the Oval after spending three years at the club

Smith played eight championship games in total for Surrey, scoring 383 runs including an innings of 103 against Gloucestershire at the Oval this year.

Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart said: 'On behalf of the club, and particularly the dressing room, I would like to thank Graeme for the impact he has had in the time that he was with us over the last two years.

'As a person and leader his qualities have helped lay the foundations for the progress that we all want for the club.'We wish Graeme the very best in the next stage of his career and he will always be welcomed at the Kia Oval.'
