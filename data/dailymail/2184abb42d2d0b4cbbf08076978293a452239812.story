Frankie Dettori was  described as ‘upset’ at losing the mount of Criquette Head-Maarek’s Prix De L’Arc de Triomphe favourite Treve.

But Harry Herbert, racing manager to the filly’s owner Qatari Sheik Joaan Al Thani, said the decision would not cause a fracture in Dettori’s job as No 1 jockey to the Sheik’s Al Shaqab racing empire.

Dettori will be replaced on Treve, firstly in Sunday’s Group One Prix Vermeille at Longchamp, by veteran French rider Thierry Jarnet at the request of the filly’s trainer Criquette Head-Maarek.

Blow: Frankie Dettori has lost the mount of Treve ahead of Group One Prix Vermeille

Jarnet rode Treve in her first three races last season and was back on board for her 2013 Arc win after Dettori broke his ankle.

Dettori won last year’s Vermeille on Treve and has also ridden her in two races this year, both of which ended in defeat with the most recent of which being her third in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot when she pulled muscles.

Harry Herbert, racing manager to Al Shaqab racing, said: ‘Of course Frankie is upset but he is an amazing team player. He understands Criquette’s reasons.

‘There is nothing more to read into this other than it is a trainer’s request.

‘It is all tiny percentages at this level and Criquette, seeing how well Jarnet gets on with Treve, particularly in the mornings, feels it is an advantage which should be taken.

‘We are all big Frankie fans but the Sheik felt that if Criquette felt that strongly it was her decision.’

Dettori will now be at The Curragh on Sunday where he will ride Richard Hannon-trained Al Shaqab filly Osaila in the Moyglare Stud Stakes.

On Tuesday he is at Chantilly to ride the Sheik’s £5.25million filly Al Namah.

The Dettori blow comes on the same weekend that back in 2012 saw him overlooked for the ride on Godolphin St Leger winner Encke.

That which prompted a spiral of events that saw him end his long association with Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation.
