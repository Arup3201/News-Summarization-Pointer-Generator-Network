From an unspeakable tragedy, a new beginning has come for Rachel and Heidi McFarland.

The Iowa couple lost their adopted son Gabriel last year in a horrific turn of events, just weeks after his birth mother decided she wanted him back.

But this week, as Gabriel's father, Drew Weehler-Smith, 18, received a 50-year prison sentence for murdering the little boy, the pair have revealed they are the proud parents to a baby daughter - and are expecting a second child any day now.

Precious: The women were contacted by a mom-to-be who had heard their story and was looking for adoptive parents to take custody of her newborn daughter

New home: Little London appears pretty with her parents, Rachel and Heidi McFarland

The women were able to adopt their baby, London, after being contacted by a mom-to-be who was touched by their story and had been searching for adoptive parents. 

Before the adoption process started however, the two decided to try and have a baby on their own.

Heidi McFarland is now eight months pregnant.

The two are expecting another little girl, who they intend to call Vienna, The Des Moines Register reported. 

The news follows an emotional week for the two, following the sentencing of Drew Weehler-Smith. 

Four-month-old Gabriel King McFarland was found unresponsive on April 22, 2014, by his mother after she left the baby in the care of his father at their Des Moines home.

The boy later passed away, with an autopsy showing Gabriel of an abusive head trauma, which authorities say he suffered at the hands of his dad, who was 17 at the time.

They believe Weehler-Smith shook the boy. 

The 
tragedy came just a month after the teen mother, Markeya Atkins, changed
 her mind about giving him up for adoption and took him back from the 
women who had brought him up as their own.

Loss: Four-month-old Gabriel McFarland died on 
April 22 last year after he suffered an abusive head trauma while in the care of 
his teenage father. Gabriel's mother had just taken him back from  
adoption

Sentenced: On Wednesday Drew Weehler-Smith, 18, received a 50-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty in January to second-degree murder in the death of his son, Gabriel, last year

Prison: Weehler-Smith's adoptive parents believe his inexperience with children contributed to the death of his son. He has also struggled with addiction

Grief: Heidi and Rachel McFarland in court in Des Moines this week for the sentencing of Drew Weehler-Smith

Gabriel's mother, Markeya Atkins, 
had left him in the care of his father so she could run errands around 7.25pm on April 22, police said. 

About 25 
minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone 
charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the 
mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith.

Atkins asked her friend to return to the 
apartment but when she did, she saw the father driving away without
 the baby.

She
 notified the mother, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not 
breathing in a glider chair.

'Someone left my 
friend's baby that they were baby-sitting by themselves, and the baby's 
blue,' the friend can be heard saying on the 911 calls, with Atkins crying in the background: 'He just left him here.'

Atkins'
 friend performed CPR before emergency medical personel took over. But the boy was pronounced dead at hospital.

Weehler-Smith, a junior at Des Moines Roosevelt High 
School, was initially charged with neglect of a dependent person but the charge was upgraded to murder.

He was tried as a adult, and plead guilty to second-degree murder.

On Wednesday morning, he was sentenced to 50 years prison, the maximum sentence.

Rachel McFarland told The Des Moines Register after the sentencing that she will probably never be able to forgive Weehler-Smith, but she believes his adoptive parents, who are also lesbians, have not been given enough credit for being amazing people.

'They are really wonderful women,' Rachel said. 

'They've lost their son; they've lost their grandson. Our families have been through hell.'

Tragic: Rachel and Heidi McFarland, pictured, cared for Gabriel from birth until one month before his death

Loving moms: The McFarlands said they only heard about Gabriel's death on the news

Rachel and Heidi McFarland adopted the boy and cared for him from birth until he was a few months old - when Atkins changed her mind, as is allowed under Iowa law, according to WhoTV.

The
 couple said they were devastated when they learned that the infant they
 had considered their own had died - while watching the news.

'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register . 

'We brought him home from the hospital. I cut his umbilical cord.'

Scene: According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment, pictured, in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road in Des Moines while she went to the library and to run errands

In Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional 
31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby.

While devastated, the McFarlands are determined not to let the failed adoption and Gabriel's death ruin their lives.

'We're just left to put the pieces back together,' Rachel said.
