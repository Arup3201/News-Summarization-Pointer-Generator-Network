You could be forgiven for thinking it was just a normal back garden with its well-kept lawn and trimmed hedgerows.

But one buyer has clearly seen some added potential in this tiny courtyard plot in central London after they paid out a staggering £84,000 - even though it has no planning permission.

The land, in Chelsea, is just 0.05 acres in size but after its sale is now worth the equivalent of £1.68 million per acre.

This courtyard garden with no planning permission has been sold in Chelsea for a staggering £84,000 having been put on the market for just £28,000

It was only expected to sell for around £28,000 - but ended up selling for three times this figure to a foreign buyer.

The new owner will now have to sit on their £84,000 investment as it can’t be built on.

For the same price they could have bought themselves a Grade II-listed one-bedroom flat in Wellington, Somerset.

The sale has netted the land’s owner a quick profit of £31,000, after they bought it eight months ago for £53,000.

Chris Coleman-Smith, head of auctions at Savills, said: 'Little bits of London, such as this, are in scarce supply and people want to get their hands on their own little piece of Chelsea.

'City environments can easily change and so this could be a very long term investment bought with grandchildren and inheritance in mind.

Despite being just 0.05 acres, the tiny courtyard garden is in a prime location in Chelsea, close to Sloane Square, Knightsbridge and Kings Road

'Who knows what it might be possible to do with it in 20 years time.'

The patch of land is in a residential area close to upmarket shopping areas such as knightsbridge and Kings Road as well as Hyde Park and Sloane Square.

Access into and out of the quaint courtyard garden is through two gates and is surrounded by buildings.

Property valuation site Zoopla estimates the average property price in the area surrounding the garden, is £2,180,840

The sale follows the £700,000 paid for a row of disused garages in Fulham.

The six garages, in Parsons Green, London were sold in April for ten times their value, after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer.

The garages, which each had a rental potential of £65 a month, were also sold without planning permission for development.

But that did not deter interest, with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded 'a first'.

The anonymous buyer, who is understood to be a developer, secured the garages for £700,000 - four times the average English house price, and one-and-a-half times the value of a typical London property.
