Croatia star Luka Modric could miss the entirety of Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign after being forced off the pitch in the 27th minute of his country's 1-1 draw with Italy on Sunday.

The 29-year-old midfielder appeared to injure his groin during a sprint and signalled to the bench that he could not play on in the feisty Euro 2016 qualifier in Milan.

Modric received medial attention on the pitch but had to be helped down the tunnel after being replaced by Inter Milan youngster Mateo Kovacic.

Dec 6 - Real Madrid vs Celta Vigo 

Dec 9 - Real Madrid vs Ludogorets (Champions League) 

Dec 16 - Real Madrid vs Cruz Azul or Western Sydney Wanderers (Club World Cup)

Dec 20 - Club World Cup final 

Spanish radio station El Partido de las 12 claim that the former Tottenham man may miss up to five weeks, which could see him ruled out until January given La Liga's winter break.

Modric looks certain to miss Real Madrid's game against Eibar on Sunday, while Carlo Ancelotti's side also have games against Basle and Ludogorets in the Champions League over the next month.

The Italian will hope to have his midfielder back in action by the time he takes Real to Morocco for the Club World Cup in December.

The Champions League holders will face either Cruz Azul or Western Sydney Wanderers in a semi-final on December 16 ahead of a potential final four days later.

If Modric's injury is as serious as feared he would miss the trip to Africa as well as league fixtures against Malaga, Celta Vigo and Almeria.

Fortunately for Croatia boss Niko Kovac, Modric's absence did not prevent his side earning a hard-fought point at the San Siro.

Ivan Perisic cancelled out Antonio Candreva's opener shortly after the Italy midfielder had given Antonio Conte's side the lead in the 11th minute.

The game had to be stopped temporarily after 75 minutes when flares and fireworks were thrown onto the pitch by visiting supporters.

Speaking after the game, Modric said: 'It's always the same and I do not understand why they do it. It's a shame to have fans like that.

'I do not know why they continue to behave like this. It's madness.'
