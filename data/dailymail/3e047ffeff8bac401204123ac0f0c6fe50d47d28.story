New leads: Scotland Yard detectives could travel to Portugal in the coming days to follow up on new leads in the case of missing Madeleine McCann (pictured)

Detectives searching for Madeleine McCann could fly to the Portuguese holiday resort where the youngster went missing within days to follow up on new leads.

Metropolitan Police officers could potentially interview suspects, search properties and even make arrests in the Algarve where Madeleine disappeared while on a family holiday in 2007.

The Crown Prosecution Service has written a Letter of Request to Portuguese judges this week asking for permission to work in the country to gather evidence alongside local police.

According to the Daily Mirror, the letter included the names of some of the suspects that police wish to speak to regarding the case and an outline of a number of offences being investigated.

Madeleine went missing from an apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant.

The shambolic Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a Home Office-funded review in 2011 – known as Operation Grange – following the intervention of David Cameron.

The Met said earlier this month that it was preparing to swoop on 38 suspects 'scattered across Europe' after announcing a full criminal investigation.

Among them are a dozen British nationals who were visiting or living in the Algarve at the time the then three-year-old went missing.

Investigators said that they have no prime suspects but said that they had found no evidence that the youngster had been murdered.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the inquiry, said: ‘We continue to believe that there is a possibility that Madeleine is alive.'

New hope: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann welcomed the Met's announcement that it had new leads earlier this month

The Met's announcement came toward the end of a two year £5million review of the case which officers said has created a 'unique picture' of what happened in the Algarve.

Mr Redwood said the painstaking review has brought together all the information about Madeleine for the first time.

He said: ‘That has given us the ability to see this case with fresh eyes, and through that bring out new – genuinely new – lines of inquiry.

‘I’m hopeful that when we pursue those lines of inquiry, we will be able to bring some sort of resolution.

'Whether we will be able to solve it is a different issue, but I hope we will be able to have the ability to move the investigation on.

'I believe that this is an important moment for Madeleine. It is a great opportunity which we intend to exploit to the full.’

A Met Police spokesman refused to comment on when detectives will be sent to Portugal as part of the investigation and the CPS was unavailable for comment.

Prime Minister David Cameron had ordered the review of the case back in 2011.
