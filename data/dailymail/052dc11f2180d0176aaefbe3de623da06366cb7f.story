Frozen merchandise continues to dominate the wish lists of young children, and industry experts have predicted that it will remain hot through the holidays.

Two toys based on the wildly popular Disney film appear on Adventure Publishing Group’s Toy Insider Hot 20 list, which was released yesterday. In fact, Frozen is the only entertainment property with more than one item on the list.

'It’s going to be a Frozen Christmas, ice cold,' said Laurie Schacht, president of Adventure Publishing, to Bloomberg News.

Hot seller: Snow Glow Elsa was one of two Frozen-inspired items to appear on Adventure Publishing Group’s Toy Insider Hot 20 list, which predicts what will top children's holiday wish lists 

'The appeal is so broad, and it’s such a wonderful story that parents are happy to put merchandise like this in their kids’ hands. 

'Disney is on the pulse of the American heartbeat these days,' she added.

One of the items on Toy Insider's list is the  Snow Glow Elsa doll, which features a dress that lights up.

The doll, which retails for $39.97 at Wal-Mart and at $34.99 at Toys R Us, also plays Let It Go, the hit song from the movie.

Let it go: The Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox, a small karaoke machine that features the film's soundtrack, also made the list

Fit for a queen: Elsa, the animated film's heroine, has remained a hit with children since Frozen's release in November 2013

The other Frozen item on the list is the Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox, a small karaoke machine that features the film's soundtrack and costs about $35.

It's not only small children who are snapping up Frozen-themed products.

Disney Consumer Products and bridal designer Alfred Angelo just announced plans to release a wedding dress inspired by the movie's heroine, Elsa, the Snow Queen of Arendelle, this January.

Since its release in November 2013, Frozen has become the highest-grossing animated film ever.

Last week, Disney announced that it had started construction on a Frozen attraction, which will replace the Maelstrom at Epcot's Norway Pavilion, at The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.
