Former Olympic BMX cyclist Kyle ‘Butter’ Bennett has been killed in a car accident in eastern Texas. He was 33.

Highly regarded for his smooth-riding technique which earned him the nickname ‘Butter’, Bennett also had a reputation amongst BMX fans as a role model for younger riders.

A three-time national and world champion, Bennett captained the U.S.'s first Olympic team when the sport made its debut at Beijing in 2008. He had recently been inducted into the BMX Hall of Fame.

The single-vehicle crash happened early Sunday in Conroe, Texas, north of Houston. Bennett was traveling at high speed, when he lost control of his 2006 Toyota Tundra pickup truck and drove off the roadway. His vehicle flipped and rolled through a ditch and crashed into the wrought-iron gate of a private residence.

Bennett was cut from the wreckage but pronounced dead at the scene. Officials said he was not wearing a seat belt.

Bennett was returning home from practice when the accident occurred, he had been preparing to return to competition at 33 - an advanced age for a top-flight BMX rider.

USA Cycling CEO Steve Johnson described Bennett as a pioneer of the sport.

‘Kyle was a pioneer in Olympic BMX and an inspiration to those of us that knew him. He will be sorely missed, and we offer our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones,' he said.

Bennett began riding at age seven, qualified for his first national championship aged nine and turned professional after graduating from high school.

Speaking ahead of the sport debuting at the 2008 Olympics, Bennett told the Houston Chronicle: 'People don't know what BMX is. They think of tricks, but we don't do that. We're racers. It will be huge to show the world what we do.'

Unfortunately Bennett got injured in his quarter-final heat. He managed to race with a reset dislocated 
shoulder two days later in the semi-final, but finished sixth and so didn't qualify for the medal round.

He is survived by his fiance and a young daughter Kylie, aged four.
