The controversial sweetener aspartame has effectively been cleared as safe to eat by Government experts following human feeding trials.

Human guinea pigs were fed cereal snack bars, some of which contained the artificial sweetener, by a team of researchers at Hull York Medical School.

The study recruited 50 people who had reported reactions after consuming aspartame in the past, such as headaches and nausea.

Safe: Food Standards Agency announced that as a result of the British research, the Committee on Toxicity(CoT) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener

There was also a control group of another 50 others who have eaten aspartame in food and fizzy drink over many years without any ill-effects.

However, the investigation found no evidence of harm in either those who reported past sensitivity to aspartame or the control group.

Significantly, this was a so-called double-blind trial where neither the trial participants or the researchers knew which of the bars was being eaten.

Yesterday, the Food Standards Agency announced that as a result of the British research, the Committee on Toxicity(CoT) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener.

The FSA said: ‘The expert committee concluded that 'the results presented did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public'.’

The government watchdog has not released the full details of the research because they remain confidential until they have been published in a peer reviewed journal.

And despite concluding there is no reason to protect consumers, the FSA said the committee had not carried out an overall safety evaluation of aspartame

A separate safety evaluation is being conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is due to be published this month. The FSA said it will send the results of the British trial to EFSA, so they can be taken into account.

The conclusions of the experts on the CoT are unlikely to satisfy the many critics of aspartame, who include Erik Millstone, Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex.

He insists there is good quality independent research projects that have identified potential problems, ranging from premature births in women who enjoy diet drinks, to cancer.

Prof Millstone, of the university’s Science and Technology Policy Research unit, believes that EFSA’s evaluation is biased in favour of aspartame.

Fizzy drinks: An EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby

He claims the EFSA panel set up to carry out the safety assessment is dominated by experts linked to manufacturers or regulators that have previously supported aspartame.

The professor pointed to several 
studies that raise real questions about the safety of aspartame and 
justify the need for further research.

An
EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans 
of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater 
risk of having a premature baby,.

It
is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - 
assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal. The research 
found this low risk was increased by 38per cent if the woman was 
drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day.

The
statistics, gathered by academics in Denmark, showed that a woman who 
routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as 
much as 78per cent. This meant that if the risk of a premature birth was
normally one in a 100, it increased to 1.78 in 100.

The
professor also highlighted work by the independent Ramazzini Foundation
in Italy, which has published research suggesting aspartame caused 
several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current 
acceptable daily intake for humans.

The concern about artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, relates to the fact that they contain methanol.

Methanol
is a nerve toxin, which can be metabolised in the body to form formic 
acid, which is another nerve toxin, as well as formaldehyde, which is 
the chemical used to preserve dead bodies.

All
of these research studies have formed part of the EFSA review. A paper 
detailing the review’s draft conclusions found they did not identify a 
health risk.
