An unusual row has broken out in Thailand after a Buddhist monk was pictured fondling a topless worshipper's breasts.

The image was posted on Facebook last week and has since been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people - many of whom were angry at the celibate monk breaking a key vow.

But the woman in the photo has now come forward to say she was born a man, and therefore believes the monk is completely innocent.

Furore: The image of a monk fondling a worshipper's breasts in Thailand was seen by hundreds of thousands of people online - and prompted a debate over whether transgender people count as women in Buddhism

She was interviewed by Thailand's Morning News, where she was quoted as saying she had undergone hormone therapy which enlarged her breasts.

She had not undergone gender reassignment surgery or received breast implants.

A person born in a woman's body would never have been able to get so close to a monk in Buddhist culture and would never dream of doing so, she told the news channel.

According to her account the monk, from a temple in Cambodia, had led a blessing ceremony at her family home in Bangkok which involved writing messages on the bodies of the faithful.

The men reportedly had the messages inscribed on their chests, while the women had the same symbols written on their foreheads.

Because the worshipper considered it acceptable to present her gender as male, she was happy to join the rest of the men for the ritual.

But that was not enough for many commenters online - who insisted the ritual was inappropriate no matter what the gender of the worshipper. 

Identified only as Thanradaporn, the worshipper said she felt guilty about the reaction the photo had, saying: 'I feel that I've damaged the monk’s reputation'.

Different culture: Thailand has a tradition of kathoeys, also known as ladyboys - the definition of which varies hugely. Kathoeys are often considered a 'third gender' and are due to receive legal protection (file photo)

The monk was reportedly from a temple in Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province, where he and others follow a strict doctrine in which they avoid all contact with women.

Monks swear a vow of celibacy in order to learn more about themselves and come closer to enlightenment.

Ideas about gender have historically been more fluid than other countries in Thailand, where there is a long tradition of kathoeys, also known as ladyboys.

The broad term can describe effeminate men, those who dress as women, those who define themselves as women or those who have undergone a sex change.

Kathoeys are also seen by many as a third gender, not simple enough to class simply as 'male' or 'female'.

Despite being popular in cabaret shows kathoeys have very few legal rights, and Thai politicians proposed earlier this year to recognise people with alternative sexualities legally for the first time.

If approved it is thought the draft constitution will ban discrimination on the basis of gender and sexuality - putting Thailand ahead of more than 30 U.S. states and much of the rest of the world.
