The son of a North Korean aide linked to Kim Jong-un's executed uncle is believed to be on the run in France after evading abduction by agents of the communist regime.

According to diplomatic sources, the man - identified only by his surname Han - has escaped detection amid fears he may be forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed.

The architecture student has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason in December 2013.

He disappeared last month while studying at Paris' prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette and speculation was rife as to whether the student had been captured or was hiding out in France.

But now a diplomatic source has revealed that despite attempts to force Han to return to North Korea, the student has evaded capture as is 'somewhere in France', The Telegraph reported.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea's biggest news agency which broke the story, told the newspaper: 'Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

'If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.'

Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer.

The student had been enrolled at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government.

The disappearance comes amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in the wake of the Sony Entertainment hacking scandal and the release of The Interview, a film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un. 

As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations.

However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities.

Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup.

According to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea)

In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'. 

Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out.

There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks.

However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle.
