This time 12 months ago Heather Watson arrived in Australia off the back of a season wrecked by glandular fever and needing to qualify for a place in the opening grand slam of 2014.

She flew into town on Saturday as one of the early form horses of the WTA Tour, armed with her second career title of the main circuit and a career-high world ranking.

The 22-year-old Guernsey right-hander will be confirmed on Monday at No 38 — one above her career best — courtesy of a 6-3, 6-4 victory over American Madison Brengle in the final of the Hobart International on Saturday.

That means a rise of more than 80 places in the past year as, in the prolonged absence of the injured Laura Robson, she remains in a league of her own as far as Britain’s women are concerned.

By adding to the Osaka event she claimed in late 2012, she becomes the first British female to win two events on the main circuit since Anne Hobbs in 1985. Watson undoubtedly benefited from the prior week of top-class competition representing Great Britain with Andy Murray in the Hopman Cup mixed team event.

‘It was a great week in Perth. I really enjoyed it. Being there as Andy’s team-mate definitely gave me a boost of confidence,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’m using everything to play good, positive tennis and I’m coming out with good results.

‘I like to have a title to my name, so I’m very pleased to get that today.’

Watson needed much of her customary pluck to overcome qualifier Brengle and collect the £28,000 winner’s cheque and 280 ranking points.

She faced 12 break points in the first two games and went behind before settling down to master the Tasmanian wind better than her opponent.

While Brengle, ranked 84, was not the most terrifying prospect in a WTA final at this level, the Channel Islander had earned her passage with an eye-catching thrashing earlier in the event of a more celebrated American, Sloane Stephens.

It is a reminder that her chief virtues of baseline aggression, outstanding athleticism and a strong temperament can carry her considerably higher than her present mark.

The Hobart win should lift Watson to a career-high ranking of 38 as she heads to Melbourne

After a somewhat deflating final third of last season when she struggled to string wins together, Watson should be able to push her ranking further, having already banked some decent points early on.

Her opponent in the first round in Melbourne will be the 67th-ranked Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, whose main career distinction has been her disproportionate expertise at Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-finals in 2010.

‘I didn’t look at who I was going to play in Melbourne until I was done in Hobart because I wanted Hobart to be my main focus until I was done,’ said Watson.

‘I’ve played Pironkova now three times. We always have really good, competitive, long matches. It won’t be easy.’

In the long run it would doubtless help Watson, who spent her teenage years in Florida after realising that Guernsey was too remote to seriously hone her tennis skills, if Robson can get back to resume their British rivalry.

Celebrating her 21st birthday next week, this event marks a year since Robson last played on the tour before succumbing to a wrist injury that ultimately required an operation.

While she is back training hard in Florida, caution continues to be the watchword with the former junior Wimbledon champion.
