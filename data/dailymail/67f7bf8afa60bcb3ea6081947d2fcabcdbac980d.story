A 'Bugatti' which lay forgotten in a dilapidated garage for nine years has been sold for £270,000 - nearly three times the amount it had been expected to fetch.

The car had been abandoned in a garage in Worcestershire, unused and unloved, covered with bags of rubbish and become blocked in by trees and
other debris.

It had been owned by engineer Alan Riley who bought the car in 1987 and was convinced it was a real 
Grand Prix-winning Bugatti Type 51 worth up to £2million.

He believed the car was the Bugatti that won the 1931 Casablanca Grand Prix, driven by Count Stanislas Czaykowski.

But when he died earlier this year after a long illness the UK’s leading Bugatti expert David Sewell was brought in to establish the car's true provenance.

He determined it is almost certainly a very skilfully executed replica, although it may contain parts of the Czaykowski car.

It was probably made in the early 1980s by a character called 
Keith Butti of Upminster who has since become notorious for making a 
number of very convincing replica Bugattis using a mixture of genuine 
and reproduction parts.

James Dennison of Brightwells Auctioneers said: 'It sold to an English couple. They were very pleased - I think they’re going to go racing in it. But it will need some rebuilding first.

'The lower estimate was £100,000 so we’re absolutely delighted with the price. There was lots of interest on the phones and in the room. It exceeded expectations.

'Prices for classic cars have been going up fairly steadily over the last five years. Anything very rare or with good history seems to keep on going up in value.

'I would say it’s an investment opportunity - if they can add some more original parts to the car they could increase its value even more.'
