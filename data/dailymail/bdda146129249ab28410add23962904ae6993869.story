An Australian policeman is a part of a crew that have successfully rowed across the Indian Ocean to break two world records and raise money for MS Australia.

They started as a crew of seven, but after 57 days six people, including Victorian Tim Spiteri, completed the continent-to-continent expedition, which is the fastest and longest rowboat crossing of the Indian Ocean.

'There were pirates, hurricanes, our boat was hit by a 15-metre blue whale, we encountered countless tiger sharks - there is nothing else the ocean could have possibly thrown at us but I actually never wanted it to end. 

'I wouldn't change a single one of the challenges we faced' says Mr Spiteri, speaking to Daily Mail Australia from their Seychelles. 

The crew pop champagne as part of their excited celebrations as they reach the shore of Seychelles, successfully completing their record breaking expedition across the Indian Ocean.

The crew included Tim Spiteri, Leven Brown, Cameron Bellamy, James Douglas-Hamilton, Heather Rees-Gaunt and Fiann Paul.

Dr Shane Usher, a 39-year-old Chemical Engineer from Melbourne, was forced to drop out halfway through the trip when he suffered serious burns after scalding himself with hot water. 

Dr Usher was on hand to welcome the crew in at Seychelles. 

'The arrival was a big event with a lot of champagne! There was a lot of happiness and relief after such a long voyage. They came off the boat with a bit of a staggered walk but are all doing very well,' Dr Usher tells Daily Mail Australia from Seychelles. 

Australian policeman Tim Spiteri on the morning his expedition departed from Geraldton, Western Australian. 57 days later, his crew had successfully rowed to Seychelles.

Mr Spiteri agrees that the crew are struggling to get their bearings on dry land.

'We were walking down the street the other day and one of the crew fell into a pothole! After 57 days at see, you think you're walking straight but you haven't quite got a grip on how your body works.'

The exhausted crew are looking forward to 'a dry bed that doesn't move,' according to Mr Spiteri. 

The team have lost a lot of weight during their expedition.

'The problem was that we faced hurricanes, with wild waves. It looks like we faced over 65 knot winds at times. Such extreme winds aren't characteristic of ocean rowing and it took the team a while to manage to keep their food down', explains Dr Usher.

The crew worked tirelessly, taking only two hour rests before picking up the oars again. 

'We rowed for two hours on and two hours off 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the entire journey. You lose track of time, the physicality of it all is so painful,' said Mr Spiteri

But the mental struggle was one of the biggest that the crew had to battle with during the trip.

'It was the most torturous, treacherous, wonderful, brilliant, life-changing experience,' explains Mr Spiteri.

The challenge was only made harder after the automatic steering system failed, and Mr Spiteri and the crew's skipper, Leven Brown, were both forced to manually navigate the boat.

'We knew it would hurt, but the physicality of having to stand still to navigate was excruciating. In the military, standing still for that period of time is used as discipline!

'It required 100 per cent concentration and it was really difficult to try and maintain course through the rain and cloud that completely obscured our vision.'

The Aurora at sea, with the Australian flag at the back of the boat used as a crucial tool to help steer and navigate - vital after the automatic steering system broke down and Tim Spiteri and Leven Brown were required to manually steer for the rest of the journey.

Mr Brown, who now holds five Guiness World Records for ocean rowing, says the mental challenge is more arduous than the physicality of rowing. 

'It's intensely physical but the relentless routine and the sheer scale of the obstacle that you have to overcome is the hardest. You have to constantly be at the top of your game.

However, Mr Brown says the team must remain level-headed at all times - even when the crew came face to face with pirates.

'There's far too much to do, you don't have time for nerves on the ocean. It's later when you look back on the brush with storms and pirates that you sit down and have a deep sigh!' said Mr Brown.

'A boat with no markings or fishing equipment came alongside us, which indicates that you're dealing with pirates. They asked us to stop but there was no way we were giving up that easily. We were 200 miles away from our destination.

'We just had to bluff. We had no equipment on board but we said we were a Royal Levy Q boat waiting for Royal Navy and would open fire. They high-tailed it out of there, it was absolutely amazing!

Mr Brown says the inability to control your environment is a liberating experience. 

'I row oceans because I have never experienced the same sense of freedom and adventure on land as I did in those moments on the boat.'

'There are sharks all around you, Blues Whales... It's a beautiful environment. The ocean is one of the last great wildernesses. 

'We saw a couple of Great Whites from our tiny little boat. You have a primal reaction: fight or flight.'

A 15-metre whale came too-close for comfort, causing damage to the team's boat.

'It was as if the whale deliberately collided with the boat, it seemed to be scratching a skin irritation,' said Mr Spiteri.

'A huge whale and little boat... It was potentially expedition ending!'

Another obstacle the crew had to overcome was losing the sixth member of their team, Mr Usher.

'A big cargo ship with medical facilities came and picked me up. The ship actually banged into the rowing boat while they were taking me on board. It took eight days to travel back to Australia and I was confined to my room for seven of those days, to avoid reinfecting my burns,' Mr Usher said.

Mr Spiteri is ecstatic about the crew's achievement. 

'It was honestly the most epic adventure anyone could go on. It was a pioneering first world attempt and I still can't get my head around the fact that we did it! It surpassed every one of my expectations.'

Tim Spiteri has so far raised more than $30 thousand for MS Australia, a cause close to his heart as his mother struggles with the condition.

'Mum was out on a boat with the other family members and met us when we reached Seychelles. To see her face at the end was unbelievable, the emotion and relief on her face. We had minimal contact with anyone during the trip so I think her heart was in her mouth the entire time we were at sea.'

Mr Spiteri found he gained insight about life with Multiple Sclerosis, a debilitating disease of the Central Nervous System.

'I was surprised that there was some synergy between my experience on the row with the kinds of struggles I've seen my Mum face with MS.

'With MS you want to do things but it doesn't work that way. Your brain won't cooperate with your brain which makes it really difficult to do the things you want to. I'm able to empathise with that struggle more now after the physical struggle of the row. 

'We faced hurricanes with winds that kept pushing us South as we tried to row North. We were prevented from doing what we wanted for a myriad of reasons. But you push through every obstacle and something you change your goals but just have to keep going. 

'It's a little like the brave people with MS that still manage to live and achieve with their symptoms everyday.'

Mr Spiteri found the physical and mental challenge to be a humbling and profound experience.

'I learnt so much about myself and about people - about what you can achieve as a group of people in arduous circumstances when you need to.

'I'm really going to miss my time being on a very small boat in a very big ocean where I didn't have any control, just the small ability to work with I have, fighting all the way. 

'It changes your philosophy about life. It makes your realise the importance of letting go. So many obstacles pop up along the way that want to take you out and knock you over, but all you can do is just do one stroke after the other and eventually you'll get there. And hopefully it's a paradise like Seychelles'
