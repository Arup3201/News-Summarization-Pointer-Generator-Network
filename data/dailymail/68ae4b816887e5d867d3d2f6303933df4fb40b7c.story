Mitt Romney’s relatives in Mexico are reportedly living in terror of being targeted by notorious cartels if he keeps up his anti-drug stance.

He has around 35 relatives in a Mormon colony controlled by Sinaloa Cartel drug lord Joaquin Guzman Lora, reported the National Enquirer.

The Republican presidential candidate’s 
great-grandfather Miles Park Romney fled to Mexico in 1885 to escape 
anti-polygamy laws in the U.S.

‘These relatives of Mitt lived quietly until now, working hard as farmers and cattle ranchers,’ a political source told the National Enquirer.

‘Although one was kidnapped, he survived and no-one has been killed,’ the source added. ‘But now they’ve been put in the spotlight.’

Mitt Romney's cousin Meredith Romney, 70, was kidnapped two years ago and held in a cave for three days until his family paid a ransom fee.

'I just figured my time was up,’ Meredith Romney said at the time. ‘I later found out they’d kidnapped 18 people and killed 14 of them.'

Threat: Sinaloa Cartel drug lord Joaquin Guzman Lora, 54, worth around $1billion, is the world's most wanted man and is known as 'El Chapo', or 'shorty'

Mitt Romney’s political advisers are reportedly concerned that he will soon have ‘blood on his hands’ if any of his relatives in Mexico are killed.

His comments on improving anti-drugs messages to young people will ‘infuriate’ Lora, a Mexican police source told the National Enquirer.

Lora, 54, worth around $1billion, is the world's most wanted man, reported Forbes. He is known as 'El Chapo', or 'shorty', for his 5'5" height.

His Sinaloa Cartel is behind around one quarter of the illegal drugs trafficked from Mexico to the U.S. and they deal primarily with cocaine.

‘I’m hoping we don’t have any 
negative outcome but it could be a problem,’ Mitt Romney’s cousin Miles 
Romney told the National Enquirer.

Mr Park Romney, who had five wives, fled 
to the Chihuahua desert in 1885 to escape U.S. Marshals after the 1882 
crackdown on polygamists.

He set up shop in Mexico with other Mormon settlers. Mitt Romney’s father George was born in Mexico before moving back to the U.S. as a child.

Relative: Karen Romney watches for a rain storm in Colonia Juarez, Mexico, last summer. Mitt Romney's family migrated there over 100 years ago

Michael Romney, one of Mitt Romney's 
cousins, told the Washington Post last summer that his 
great-grandfather's wives 'lived like sisters’.

'Despite emigrating, my great-grandfather never lost his love of country'

Today, however, the Mormons of northern Mexico no longer practice polygamy, and the Mormon church officially banned the practice in 1890.

In his 2004 book Turnaround, Mitt Romney wrote: 'Despite emigrating, my great-grandfather never lost his love of country.'

The Romney family can be traced as far back to 17th century Great Britain, when William Romney served as Lord Mayor of London.
