David Petraeus was shocked to hear his mistress had been sending harassing emails to a female friend and asked her to stop before the situation blew up into a sex scandal that cost him his job.

Petraeus told friends he was stunned when he found out that his biographer Paula Broadwell - with whom he was carrying on a lurid sexual affair - was suspected of sending anonymous, threatening emails to a friend who she saw as a rival for the ex-CIA boss' affections.

A source close to Petraeus said Monday that FBI investigators informed him that Broadwell sent anonymous emails to Jill Kelley, a family friend of the general from his time at Central Command in Tampa, Florida, warning her to stay away from him. 

Request: Gen Petraeus, pictured with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell, asked her to stop when he found out she was sending threatening emails to family friend Jill Kelley

When Kelley told Petraeus that Broadwell was behind the emails, the four-star general told his biographer to knock it off, The Washington Post reported.

The associate spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations with Petraeus. The CIA director resigned on Friday after confessing to and apologizing for the affair.

Broadwell reportedly sent the emails from dummy accounts she had set up to Mrs Kelley, FoxNews.com reported.

Spooked by the bullying in her inbox, Mrs Kelley notified the FBI.

Victim: Jill Kelley, a family friend of Gen Petraeus, went to the FBI after she received the threatening emails

Mistress: Paula Broadwell's close contact with Gen Petraeus raised red flags among his advisers

A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.'

The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and felt she was in a 'lovers triangle.'

What followed was an intense FBI probe in which Broadwell and Petraeus - both married with two children - admitted to investigators that they had engaged in on-the-side sexual trysts.

A senior federal law enforcement official told NBC News that the probe concluded on November 2, just four days before the presidential election.

The network reported that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wasn't notified of the investigation until Election Day.

Indiscreet: Aides have said Paula Broadwell posted Facebook postings about her adventures in Afghanistan that crossed the line into potentially leaking sensitive operational details

Insensitive: Paula Broadwell traveled frequently to interview Petraeus during his time in Afghanistan but sources said her immodest attire made her stick out like a sore thumb in the conservative culture

The emails were not the first time Broadwell had raised red flags while behind a computer.

Advisers to Petraeus had become suspicious Broadwell due to her playful Facebook status updates they claim disclosed sensitive details about military operations in Afghanistan.

She became a cause of concern back in 2009 when those in Petraeus' inner circle saw her lighthearted postings on Facebook.

Former Petraeus aides told the Washington Post that Broadwell's behavior at the time seemed odd and her closeness to the 
notoriously straight-laced family man was not without controversy.

Skeptical: Those close to Petraeus were shocked the military chief placed so much confidence in Paula Broadwell since they say she lacked the credibility and credentials of a biographer

Security no-no: Petraeus passed on an unofficial photograph to Broadwell of him meeting with actress Angelina Jolie at the CIA, breaking with agency protocol

Without
any specific examples of her Facebook postings, aides said they were 
stunned that Broadwell was so free to describe her daily movements in 
Afghanistan on the networking site, so her friends back home could 
chronicle her adventures.

Another social media no-no occurred 
when Broadwell posted a picture to her Facebook page of Petraeus with 
actress Angelina Jolie, that had been captured at his 7th floor office 
at CIA headquarters, where only the official agency photographer is 
allowed.

It is 
believed he had given the picture to Broadwell but the break with 
protocol was uncharacteristic for someone in his position.

Intimidation: Broadwell was found to have sent harassing emails to Jill Kelley, a family friend of Petraeus

Wife and mother: Paula Broadwell, pictured with her husband Scott, who is a surgeon, is a mother of two young sons

Inconceivable: Aides have said even though they found Broadwell's behavior strange, they wouldn't have guessed that Petraeus, a well-known family man (pictured with his wife Holly), would have an affair
