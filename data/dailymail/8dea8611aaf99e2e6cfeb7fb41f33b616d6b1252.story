A teenager was killed and her friend seriously injured when a drunk driver slammed into the side of their car after running a stop sign.

Brittany Sailors, 16, died at the scene after attempting to make a left turn on Sunday evening around 9.30pm and another car collided with her vehicle.

Lacey Gowens, 16, who was in the passenger seat, was taken to hospital in Graystone, Georgia where she remained in a serious condition but with non-life threatening injuries. Neither girl was wearing her seatbelt when the accident happened.Â

Friends of the 16-year-old girls heard the crash and ran to pull them from the wreckage of the 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante.

'Me and another guy broke off the two back doors to try to get them,' friend Josh Kennedy told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The teenager's father Mike Kennedy also tried to help free the young women and described the scene as 'traumatizing'.
