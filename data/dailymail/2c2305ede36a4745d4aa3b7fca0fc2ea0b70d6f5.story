The HMAS Success is leading the mission to find wreckage from Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and deliver closure to the families of the doomed passengers, but experts warn the recovery operation is complicated and may be beyond the Australian warship's means.

The Success was dispatched to locate two objects spotted by an RAAF Orion aircraft, a mission made even more crucial by the announcement from Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that MH370 crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people on board.

The search was further complicated by adverse weather conditions Tuesday, but clearer conditions today paved the way for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to resume the hunt for debris. The Success has yet to locate objects seen from the air.

The 218 crew on board the HMAS Success have been tasked with trying to locate wreckage from the doomed airliner MH370, after several air crews and satellites spotted large objects in the Indian Ocean. The airliner was ruled to have crashed within the southern search zone, killing everyone on board

The vessel, which measures 515 feet (157 metres) in length and carries a crew of 218, is capable to some extent of recovering debris from the ocean.

But defence expert John Blaxland from the Australian National University told News Corp the recovery mission may require intervention from the more heavily US Navy.

'It's not something weâ€™re good at,' he said.

'It's something we need the US Navy for. [But the mission is] at the limit of anyone's capability.'

Captain Allison Norris, the commander of the HMAS Success, say morale is good and that her crew understand the enormity of the task at hand

Success commanding officer, Captain Allison Norris, however stands confident her crew will make best use of the Australian Navy's largest vessel to help provide the grieving families 'the answers they deserve'.

'HMAS Success ship's company are entirely focused on the mission at hand,' Captain Norris said this week.

'Morale is good and they are focused on the tasking we've been assigned to search for and locate any debris.

'The ship's company are acutely aware that there are families... and we see it as our role to do whatever we can to provide them the answers that they deserve.'

An impressive and powerful vessel weighing 18,000 tonnes, the Success was built in 1986 and is capable of reaching speeds of 20 knots, with a range of almost 30,000 square kilometres (8600 nautical miles).

Success's responsibility in the search mission took on new meaning as data from private British satellite company, using a wave phenomenon to interpret seven satellite pings from MH370, led Malaysian authorities to conclude the Boeing 777-200 met its end in the southern Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Razak delivered the chilling news at a press conference in Malaysia, after the families of the passengers on board were notified via text message that authorities had no choice but to conclude the plane 'is lost'.
