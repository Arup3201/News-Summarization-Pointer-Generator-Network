August is proving a very busy month for the family of former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, whose daughter Elizabeth tied the knot on Sunday and who is expected to give birth to her first child later this month.

At eight and half months pregnant, 26-year-old Elizabeth looked positively glowing as she wed her boyfriend and the father of her unborn son, Eduardo Hernandez in Washington D.C. on Sunday evening.

Elizabeth, the self-confessed ‘trouble maker’ in the Mormon family of seven children, certainly seemed to living up to that reputation with her non-traditional approach to starting a family.

Not long to go: Libby Huntsman, who is expecting her first child later this month, poses on her wedding day with older sister Abby

Older sister Abby, 28, who has been mentioned as a possible new anchor on The View, was happy to share several photos of the Huntsman clan’s big day on Instagram.

Along with a photo of the happy couple kissing, the blushing bride was also pictured with flowers in her hair and her large baby bump fully on display.

Other photos posted online over the last day or so showed the Huntsman clan happily posing together.

The former ambassador to China and his wife Mary Kaye have seven children. Elizabeth (also known as Libby) has two older sisters, Mary Anne (Mame) and Abigail (Abby) plus two younger brothers Jon and William and two adopted sisters, Gracie who was born in China in 1999 and Asha who was born in India in 2006.

This is the family’s second wedding. Abby also married outside of the Mormon Church when she got wed her college sweetheart, Jeffrey Livington, in an Episcopal ceremony in 2010.

Libby's wedding was originally supposed to be in March but got pushed back to this weekend. With the happy couple expecting a baby boy in August 28, it means the two big events have unusually fallen in the same calendar month.

The weekend’s wedding comes two months after the couple’s baby shower.

Back when Jon Huntsman was battling it out to become the Republican nominee for the 2012 Presidential Election, the three eldest daughters had joined their father on the campaign trail.

In November 2011, the girls and their father sat down with Fox News host Sean Hannity for a cosy family interview in which they revealed that Elizabeth was the ‘trouble maker’ of the family.

The University of Pennsylvania student told the Fox host that she had aspirations to appear on Saturday Night Live - either in front of or behind the cameras.

The budding comedian had then revealed how that she had embarrassed her father during one of the televised debates when she had tweeted that just because Mitt Romney had watched Panda Express didn’t mean he had foreign policy experience.

Nowadays, Libby's Twitter handle describes her a 'self-proclaimed failed comedian who sometimes engages in the occasional political banter.'

Her father's 2012 presidential run wasn't the first time she had embarrassed him. Her father revealed during the Fox interview that his troublesome daughter had even dated the son of his Democratic rival Scott Matheson when he was Utah Governor.

‘Why did I become a diplomat? It's the only way to get through this family. Are you kidding!’ he joked.

‘I think the fact that my dad is still alive, raising her is one reason he will be the best president of this country,’ said Abby, who is now a conservative anchor on MSNBC's The Cycle and is also currently in the running to join The View.

Despite being a Republican, she appeared in a 2013 campaign in support of gay marriage and producers on the TV show are hopeful she could help increase its appeal with a younger demographic.
