Amir Khan has revealed he would relish a fight against Kell Brook in the UK, following the latter's IBF welterweight world title triumph on Saturday night.

Unbeaten fighter Brook beat deposed champion Shawn Porter by a majority decision in Los Angeles - with the judges scoring the bout 117-111 and 116-112 in his favour while the other official classed it as a draw on 114-114 points apiece.

The Sheffield boxer's success in America has led to speculation that a domestic super-fight with Khan could next be on the cards for the pair.

Let's get ready to rumble: Khan (centre) and Brook haven't seen eye-to-eye in the past

The duo have publicly revealed in the past that they don't seen eye-to-eye and the opportunity to fight Brook is something Khan would look forward to in Britain.

'I think it definitely can happen, we'll just leave it to the teams now to negotiate and talk about what's going to happen,' Khan told BBC Radio 5 Live when asked if he would fight Brook.

'I'm contracted to Golden Boy Promotions and Al Haymon, who's my advisor, so I'm just going to let them takeover and if the fight can happen - let's make it.

'I'm up for it and it's definitely a fight the British crowd would want to see.

'Having the fight in the UK would be amazing. I'd like it somewhere such as Wembley Stadium which I think would be a quick sell out.

'It's a fight that would have the UK fans excited, it's something they've been talking about for a long time and I always said Kell would have to prove himself first before he can fight me.

'Now he's done that by beating Porter and winning a world title, but then you can't disrespect me because I've been on the world title stage for a long time and he has to remember that.

'He's an all-around good fighter, but the way to beat Kell is to be in control, push him back, make him think and hit the angles.

Weaknesses: Khan believes Brook's (left) body is a weak spot of the Sheffield fighter

'I think he has a weak body as well, at times he got caught with a shot and he was hurt. He's a big puncher but by making him move you can catch him then and he can't sit on his punches.

After his victory against Porter, Brook said Khan 'can get in the queue' as the 28-year-old lines up mega fights against the ilk of Floyd Mayweather.

The pound-for-pound king Mayweather has long been a potential opponent of Khan's and the Bolton boxer believes Brook has to get past him first before dreaming at a shot against the 37-year-old.

'If he thinks about what he's said, I've been in eight world title fights winning two world titles as well unifying world titles. This is only his first world title so he's got a long way to go yet before he can get past me,' Khan added.

'I've had one fight at this weight division and now we're at the same weight - our fight can happen.

'Kell has to have a couple of more big fights before he can think about that.

'He's only just got his one world title and I'm sure he'll want to defend it a few times before having a super-fight with the likes of myself, Mayweather or [Manny] Pacquiao.

'Time will tell but I'm sure we'll discuss a bout.'
