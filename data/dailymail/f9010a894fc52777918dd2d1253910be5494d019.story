Since the car radio was born 85 years ago there's been one golden rule - the driver picks the music.

Now that could finally be about to change, thanks to technology which reportedly splits the family saloon into four 'personal sound zones' with no need for headphones.

It works by having an array of speakers - in headrests and the car roof, for example - which direct a different set of sound waves towards each 'corner' of the car.

Pioneering: The rule of 'my car, my music' could finally be over - thanks to a set of headphones which can reportedly split the family saloon into four 'personal sound zones' each with noise-cancelling technology

Noise-cancelling systems, which are already common in personal headphones, then monitor unwanted background noise in each corner and add 'inverse' sound waves to cancel it out.

Such technology has been a long-held dream of audio engineers across the world, and a more primitive prototype was unveiled by British researcher Dr Jordan Cheer in 2013.

Dr Cheer, of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at the University of Southampton, said his system provided two 'listening zones' - one for the front seats and one for the back.

But the latest system is said to promise four zones - a major coup if so for its designer Harman, a U.S. audio firm which provides stereos to names including Audi, BMW, Fiat, Ferrari and Ford.

Details of the new system are scant but it features today in the Sunday Times, where it is claimed Harman will unveil it this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The effect, researchers claim, will be a car where each passenger listens to their own choice of music but can still hold a conversation over the din.

The background noise could be cut by 20 decibels,  equal to reducing a normal voice in conversation to a whisper.

According to the Sunday Times report, the system could go into production in as little as a year - though it is so far unclear what it would cost.

Phil Eyler, Harman's general manager of global automotive audio, told the newspaper: 'Today, when a navigation prompt comes on, it interrupts the music for everyone.

'Now only the driver will hear "Turn left in 100ft". The music doesn't stop for other passengers'.

Based in Detroit, Michigan - the down-on-its-luck former heart of the U.S. car industry - Harman employs more than 16,000 people and made sales of £3.65billion last year.

Its revelation could help stop arguments over music, cited by an AA survey as the eight-biggest cause of in-car fights after driving too fast and not knowing the route.

Getting it in your current car might be a bit tricky, though - since the most advanced hi-fi systems can already cost upwards of £10,000.

Dr Cheer presented his previous theory to a 2013 conference in Montreal, Canada.

He said at the time it 'would allow, for example, the driver to listen to a navigation system while the rear passengers watched a film'.

He added: 'Personal audio systems have previously been implemented in mobile devices and monitors, for example, however, the investigation of the effects of an enclosure on the generation of personal listening zones has been limited.'
