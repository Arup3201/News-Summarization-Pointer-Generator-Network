With the help of NSW Coroner Derrick Hand, who presided over the original report into Hutchence's death, Dr Shepherd was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found.

Dr Shepherd has previously looked at the high profile deaths of Michael Jackson, Anna Nicole Smith and Whitney Houston as part of his television series.

'Deciding at the end of a complex case like this which is the most important factor is very difficult. Here we’ve got drug use, drug abuse and also hanging – which one is the most important in determining the cause of death?' he said of Hutchence's death.

The events leading up to Hutchence's death are charted in the episode using toxicology reports not previously seen before. 

While there were no traces of heroin in his blood stream, Mr Hand said it didn't mean that Hutchence wasn't using heroin.

The autopsy report showed Hutchence had a severe burn on two of his fingers, which was almost down to the bone. Dr Shepherd said this was common in heroin addicts who fall into a deep anaesthetised state and may not notice a cigarette burning through their skin.

His death was reported by the NSW Coroner to be the result of suicide. The moment he was found in his hotel door with a belt around his neck has been reenacted for the episode

Dr Shepherd said the toxicology report showed there was a mixture of cocaine, alcohol and the anti-depressant Prozac in his blood when he died.

The episode revealed that Hutchence had started taking the prescription anti-depressant after suffering a blow to head in a fight with a taxi driver in 1993.

The incident, which occurred while he was dating girlfriend at the time Helena Christensen, led him to lose all sense of smell and taste.

Dr Shepherd said his use of Prozac was erratic and led to increased use of other drugs in the years prior to his death.

'There are so many twists and turns in the medical evidence, putting them all in the correct order and reaching a final conclusion can be very difficult,' Dr Shepherd said.

His death was reported by the NSW Coroner to be the result of suicide after he was found hanging on the back of his hotel door with a belt around his neck.

But his girlfriend Paula Yates publicly insisted Hutchence had died accidentally during a sex game gone wrong - a fact examined by Dr Shepherd in his episode.

'In my experience, sadly, it’s not that unusual for happy people to commit suicide without leaving any note and without giving any explanation. In that sense Michael Hutchence death is not unique,' he said.

'He lived the rock n roll lifestyle for approximately 20 years but in the end it was the mundane pressures of ordinary life that proved too much for him to handle.'

Autopsy: The Last Hours of Michael Hutchence aired on Channel 5 in the UK in July.

The episode will premiere in Australia on Channel 7 on Sunday, September 14.
