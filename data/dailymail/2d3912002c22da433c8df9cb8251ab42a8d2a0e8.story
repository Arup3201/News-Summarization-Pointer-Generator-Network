Surrounded by mobiles ringing, emails pinging, screens flickering and worries about work, it is impossible to get enough sleep these days. Or so we tend to believe.

In reality, we’re actually getting more shut-eye than we were 30 years ago, a study has claimed.

Research has revealed the proportion of adults managing at least nine hours of sleep a night has risen sharply since the early 1980s.

New research suggests we get more sleep than we did 30 years ago

One in four now gets a full nine hours on most nights, compared with fewer than one in six in 1983.

Meanwhile, the numbers getting by on six hours or fewer has fallen to just 10 per cent, down from 15 per cent three decades ago.

The University of Sydney research calls into question the notion that our 24-hour society has disrupted conventional sleeping patterns.

Nick Glozier, professor of psychological medicine at the university, said: ‘In the UK, short sleep has been less common in every survey since 1983, but long sleep has been more common. This turns the concept of an increasingly sleep-deprived society on its head.’

Instead, researchers believe the perception that we are all sleeping less stems from the fact that populations in developed countries are ageing and actually need less rest.

Sleep deprivation has emerged as a major concern in recent years. In 2010, a team of British and Italian researchers found that regularly getting fewer than six hours a night could increase the risk of premature death by 12 per cent.

Sleep deprivation has become a major health concern in recent years

Last year, University of Pennsylvania scientists reported that two hours of missed slumber is enough to stop the brain from laying down and storing memories – and simply dropping from eight hours of sleep to six could make the difference.

And a Japanese study found men who snooze for an average of nine hours a night may be half as likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly because lack of sleep may trigger inflammation in blood vessels.

But the latest research casts doubt on how many of us are actually affected by sleep deprivation. It pooled data from surveys carried out down the years in the UK as well as Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Holland, Norway, Sweden and the US.

‘We found strong evidence that long sleep durations have become more common in adults in the majority of countries examined,’ the researchers said. ‘But the prevalence of short sleep duration has shown no consistent increase over the last three decades.’

However, they warned that sleeping too long can also be harmful. Previous studies have indicated lying in bed for more than eight or nine hours every night could signal mental health problems, conditions such as diabetes or even the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
