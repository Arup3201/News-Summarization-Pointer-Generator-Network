Gill Barlow says her daughter Jasmin is in desperate need of specialist care after anorexia caused her weight to fall to 6st and destroyed one of her kidneys

A mother says she is in a 'race against the clock' to save her anorexic daughter's life - but fears the NHS will not give her the help she needs.

Gill Barlow, says her daughter Jasmin is in desperate need of specialist care after the illness destroyed one of her kidneys and left her weighing just six stone.

Despite the devastating effect on her health, she claims mental health officials 
have so far failed to arrange appropriate care for her, which has 
resulted in repeated emergency admissions to general wards.

'Every day, Jasmine wakes up and asks herself "will I die today",' she said.

'She needs far more help from the NHS or she will die. They’re not giving her the care she needs and this has been going on about two years.

'She’s had about 25 emergency admissions in that time and we’re just going round in circles.

'I feel like I’m racing against the clock to get her the right treatment.'

Ms Barlow wants her daughter to be in an eating disorder unit with the right specialists giving her the attention she needs.

'We’ve been told she will definitely need dialysis and a kidney transplant but she’ll need to be in a better physical state before that happens - and she can’t do that without more help,' she added.

Jasmin, 26, who lives with her mother in Blackburn, Lancashire, has been under the care of the East Lancashire Eating Disorder Service, but this does not cater for patients with acute problems.

Ms Barlow added: 'The eating disorder service just isn’t equipped to deal with cases as complex as Jasmin’s, who is also bipolar and has type two bulimia.

'I think they are starting to realise that she needs proper 24-hour care and they’re now trying to get her into the Priory Hospital in Preston, a specialist unit, but we’re still waiting.

'I’ve heard people say that she should just eat but it’s a mental illness and it’s not that simple.'

Despite weighing a healthy 10st before she was diagnosed five years ago, Jasmine’s health has rapidly deteriorated and, at 5ft 5in tall, she now weighs 6st.

With a body mass index (BMI) of just 14, which is well below the recommended minimum of 18.5, her condition has become so severe that her stomach automatically repels food.

Her mother says she has had to fight untill she was 'blue in the face' for the NHS to provide a peg-feed, which can be inserted through her stomach.

But
 when Jasmin’s mental state deteriorates, she stops using the feed, 
which results in her being rushed to hospital with renal failure, due to
 dehydration and low potassium levels.

Jasmin said: 'I wake up every day in tears and every morning I ask myself "will I die today?"

Jasmin has been admitted to hospital several times and, at times, has to be fed through a tube in her stomach

Ms Barlow said: 'I feel like I'm racing against the clock to get her the right treatment'

'I desperately want help but the hospital doesn't know what to do with me.

'They don’t seem to understand my illness and I feel like they think I’m being selfish and choosing not to eat.

'But it’s not a choice - it’s a mental illness. There’s so much ignorance surrounding anorexia and bulimia and that makes it so much harder to recover. I want nothing more than to get better but I feel so alone.

'Anorexia is a physical illness as well as a mental one and the mental health ward only offers me therapy.

'I need to be in a proper eating disorder unit that specialises in treating people with the illness. If they don’t address the problem soon I will die.'

Jasmin said: 'I wake up every day in tears and every morning I ask myself "will I die today?"'

Blackburn
 with Darwen Clinical Commissioning Group said the Eating Disorder 
Service will be a priority in its commissioning plans for 2015/16.

In a statement provided to MailOnline, Shelley French, Eating Disorder Team Manager at Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'The Trust’s Eating Disorder service provides assessment and treatment interventions within the community, for people presenting with a primary eating disorder.

'The team works closely with other organisation including the Hospitals Trust to support service users who may require secondary care services.

'We are unable to discuss details relating to an individual’s care due to confidentiality reasons.'
