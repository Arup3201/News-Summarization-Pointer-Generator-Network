For Richard Sherman, the fall out and vile racist abuse the Seattle Seahawk lineman faced is by far not the hardest challenge he has had to overcome.

Sherman, the hottest name in American sport right now after he secured the Seahawks' place in the Super Bowl with a sensational last minute interception, has had to fend off claims he is unsporting after he went on an aggressive tirade in a post-match interview.

But to those who know him and where he is from, he personifies the 'American Dream' come true.

Reformed: Kevin Sherman told MailOnline how he would show his children the scars from being shot twice in the chest when he was a gangster. He is now a garbage man and spoke to MailOnline about his family's story

Against the odds: Richard as a child. His father says his upbringing has given him the passion to succeed that was so misunderstood by football fans shocked at his rant after the game on Sunday

What has been lost in the sound and bluster of the last few days is how Sherman, 25, has achieved fame and fortune against all the odds.

He was brought up in the city of Compton, south of Los Angeles, notorious for its gangs such as the Bloods and the Crips.

His
 best friend – and high school football teammate - was killed in a 
shooting and his elder brother Branton, 28, went to jail for drug 
dealing.

Even his father was once a gang member before turning his life around after being shot twice in the chest.

All this experience was turned to Sherman’s advantage making him even more determined to succeed, his family said.

'My son is misunderstood,' said his father Kevin Sherman, 49, a refuge collector, in an interview with the MailOnline.

Proud and supportive: Beverley and Kevin Sherman brushed off any criticism of their son Richard after his brash rant on live television on Sunday night

Drive: Mr Sherman told MailOnline: 'Richard was very upset but he used what happened as motivation. He used it to make himself the best man that he could ever be'

'He plays football at a high intensity but off the field you could not meet a better person. He is a well-spoken and upstanding citizen who takes real pride in himself. He just has the kind of passion you need to make it from where he is from.'

That passion, so evident in his post-match interview with Erin Andrews, drove him not only making it as a footballer on the verge of a Super Bowl but also to graduate from Stanford, one of America’s most prestigious universities.

Sitting in his home in Compton, Mr Sherman said that he and his wife Beverly, 50, were determined Richard, Branton and their daughter Krystina, 22, a hairdresser, would not make the same mistakes as him.

He often showed them the scars from two gunshot wounds he received as teenager as a deterrent to keep them out of trouble.

'I made sure that my children did not go down the path that I went down,' he said. 'This is a rough area and it was even rougher then.  I ran with the wrong people.

'I went to jail for anti-social behavior. I was playing truant. One day I was sitting on a porch with some gang members when another gang tried to kill them.

Bonus: to his family, Sherman, pictured winning the match for Seattle at the play off game on Sunday, getting to the Super Bowl is 'the icing on the cake'. His father said: 'Getting him to college was my first job'

'I was shot twice and had bullets lodged just above my heart. I was very lucky but it was a wake up call. It got my attention.

'I realised that I had to get my act together. I got married and my wife Beverly was instrumental in keeping me out of trouble.

'I knew I was meant to stay here to see my boys and I made sure that my life got better. I used to show them my bullet wounds to show them what happens when you get in with the wrong crowd and not doing what I was supposed to do.'

He said that Richard was motivated from the very start and had a brilliant mind that meant he finished second in his class with a 4.2 grade point average.

'He did advance classes to get this higher percentage', he said. 'He chose Stanford over better football colleges because he wanted a great education.

'He got his degree and he is a couple of classes off his masters. When you look at the statistics and where he is from that is amazing.

'To me getting him to college was me doing my job. Getting to the Super Bowl is the icing on the cake.

'It
 really doesn’t matter if he wins because he has achieved so much 
already. Never in my wildest dreams would I think I would be sitting 
here right now.

'It is 
amazing what my boys have done. This is what you work your entire life 
for. I am very, very proud of him. I am overwhelmed by his success.'

Kevin,
 who coached his sons every night after work, said there were setbacks –
 not least the shooting to death of his best friend Marcus Peters, 19, 
in 2007.

But typically Richard used it to motivate himself.

Pride: The Sherman family home, still in Compton, is a shrine to Richard's achievements in the last few years

Decent: Richard's brother told MailOnline that 'everybody who comes from Compton is not always a gangbanger. There is a lot of good in Compton. There is a lot of good in the inner city'. Pictured, family home

'Marcus was not so lucky,' Kevin said. 'He and Richard were best friends. They ran together for many, many years. He was the nicest kid you would ever want to meet.  

'Richard was very upset but he used what happened as motivation. He used it to make himself the best man that he could ever be.'

Richard’s brother Branton, who was also a college footballer, said that he saved him from a life of crime.

'Richard is just the perfect little brother,' said Branton who is now the player's business manager and runs a sports marketing company.

'Richard was always on the straight 
and narrow. He would always stay out of trouble. He followed what I did 
but he learned from my mistakes.

'When
 he was at Stanford I got into drug dealing and ended up in jail.  My 
little brother came down and said: "I don’t support the street stuff.  
Come up with me to Seattle and we are going to work hard and make things
 happen".'

He agreed 
that his brother had a 'chip on his shoulder' but said that was only 
because people were prejudiced against his background.

'He
 represents the American Dream,' he said. 'He is an awesome person. He 
is a great guy who is just passionate about what he does. '

Not thugs: Branton, left, said: 'People have this image of where we are from, that we are all thugs, that we are all black people going off the Richter scale. But it is not true.' Richard, right, is pictured with his parents and sister Krystina

Richard himself reacted angrily to the racism he faced on Twitter in particular in the wake of his interview. He at first sent out a message that 'racism is alive and well in America'.

Then in a CNN interview he said: 'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world.

'I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way,' Sherman said. 'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.'

Branton added: 'People have this image of where we are from, that we are all thugs, that we are all black people going off the Richter scale. But it is not true. Richard is as far from that as you can get.'

He said that he and his brother run a charity called Blanket Coverage to help children in the inner city and regularly visit schools and colleges in the area to help others become a success.

Kevin and Richard's mother, Beverley, a senior clerk for California Children's Services, said they hoped his success would change the view of inner city children.

Confused: Richard, in an interview with CNN, said he was saddened by the racial slurs he faced after the game

'I would love for Richard to change the perceptions of kids from the inner city, kids that come from bad neighborhoods,' Kevin said.

'I want people to know that there are kids doing the right thing. Everybody who comes from Compton is not always a gangbanger.

'There is a lot of good in Compton. There is a lot of good in the inner city.'
