Shannon McDonnell has returned to Wests Tigers after three years in England.

The full-back had spells with Hull KR, Hull FC and then St Helens in 2014, missing their Grand Final win over Wigan with a broken jaw.

The injury did not stop the 27-year-old making his Ireland debut in the season-ending European Championship, though.

McDonnell started his career at Wests before going to the Newcastle Knights, and has been given a trial contract ahead of the forthcoming NRL season.
