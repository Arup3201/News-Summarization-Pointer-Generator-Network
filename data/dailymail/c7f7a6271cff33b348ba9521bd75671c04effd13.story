This is the incredible footage of the latest wonder-dog to send social media into meltdown - by riding on horseback.

The three-year-old pooch was filmed performing the amazing balancing act in  Russia - using its front paws to lean on its owner, while its back paws bounce up and down on the horse's back.

The brown mongrel has become an internet hit while also taking on celebrity status in its native region - the Republic of Bashkortostan in the south of the country. 

Barking mad! The incredible video captured Graf the dog riding a horse with his owner in Russia

The dog's proud owner, Aidar Vagin, 28, said: 'It's bizarre, but Graf loves few things more than riding on the back of our horse. 

'We had been out in the fields one day rounding up stray cows that had wandered off from the herd and at the end of it he was very tired.

'In the past, I would get on the horse and he would trot alongside us as we went home.

'But on this particular day when I climbed onto the horse he jumped up behind me and rested his paws on my shoulder and barked, as if to say 'Ok, let's go'.

The farmer added: 'The horse didn't seem to mind and nor did I so we set off and now he does it all the time.'

Local Marya Kharitonova, 24, said: 'It is so cute to see him.

'He stands on the horse's back with his front paws on Aidar's shoulders and seems to be loving it. People wave and take photos and he barks in response.'

Some fans have even asked to buy Graf off his owner.

Aidar said: 'I've had quite a few offers from other farmers and even shops who want to buy him but he's not for sale.

'He's a good dog, a good worker and my best friend. No amount of money is worth that.'
