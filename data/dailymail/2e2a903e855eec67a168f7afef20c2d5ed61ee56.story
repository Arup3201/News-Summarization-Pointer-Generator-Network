At 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds, Brandon Bass can shoot hoops when it matters most... he's in in top physical condition – but one thing he can’t do is swim.

It’s the one thing his 6-year-old son, Brandon Bass Jr., can beat his daddy at.

Now, Mr Bass climbed into the shallow end with 10 children from the Boys & Girls Club of Boston to take their first swimming lesson.

In the water: Boston Celtics' Brandon Bass Learning How to Swim at Age 28

Soaring: Brandon Bass #30 of the Boston Celtics may well float through the air in this defensive shot, but when it comes to floating through the water... he's not quite as confident, just yet

Late starter: Bass is learning along with ten children from the Boys & Girls Club of Boston

He has vowed to continue taking lessons until he is confident enough to swim on his own

‘My son’s the first one in the family to learn how to swim,’ says Mr Bass, who is now in his third season with the Celtics.

‘If you threw me out in the ocean, I would drown.’

‘I’m nervous, because I don’t know how to float,’ he told  the Boston Globe,  ‘I can’t tread water.’

It's hoped that Mr Bass's desire to learn swimming well into adulthood will encourage more young and old people to learn the ability.

Growing in confidence: The player has a house in Florida set on a lake so he believes being able to swim will be a great benefit

Growing up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, there was no place for him to learn to swim.

But he says, he recalls an incident when a neighbour his age drowned – the memory stayed with him.

His two children, Brandon Jr. and 20-month-old Bella, have already taken swimming lessons and it is them which provide the motivation for him to learn at this time.

Also, Bass bought a house with a pool on a lake in Orlando, where the family spends the off-season.

 He also bought a Jet Ski, which he and his son use together.

‘I can tell he’s having the time of his life, and he doesn’t have a worry in the world,’ says Bass. ‘But I’m a little worried.’

He feels that as the man of the house he needs to learn to swim. He says he beleives other parents should learn, too, and encourage their children.

‘Even if you don’t want to swim,’ he says, ‘it’s important to learn in case you need to.’
