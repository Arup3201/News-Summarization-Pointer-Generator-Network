Tragic loss: Henry Miller died aged only 19

A British teenager who died after taking a hallucinogenic drug in a tribal ritual during a gap year in Colombia was encouraged to try it by his hostel.

Henry Miller, 19, from Bristol, took Yage – which induces vivid hallucinations – while taking part in a tribal ritual in remote rainforest.

His body was later found dumped on a dirt track.

His grieving family said the teenager, who was due to go to university in September, suffered a reaction to the plant infusion after the hostel he was staying at recommended the drink.

The Casa del Rio hostel in Mocoa in the Putumayo region promoted the drug on the ‘things to do’ section of its website. Yage is said to create hallucinations more extreme than those caused by LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms.

The website entry read: ‘Experience Yage, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate’.

However, yesterday the reference was deleted from the hostel’s website. Owner Felipe Geomare told The Mail on Sunday Henry checked out of the hostel before he died.

Mr Geomare said: ‘I have nothing to do with the ritual or the indigenous community in which it’s taken. Many tourists want to become part of the ritual and ask to take Yage and so I help them organise it but it’s not my fault.’

Henry’s parents Elizabeth and David, both 52, paid tribute to their ‘adventurous, polite and very much loved’ son in a statement yesterday.

Colombian police are now investigating the death, and the people who supplied the drug.
