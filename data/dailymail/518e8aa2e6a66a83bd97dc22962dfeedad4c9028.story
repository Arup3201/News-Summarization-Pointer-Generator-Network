A Michigan jail inmate just a month away from release faces even more time behind bars after his girlfriend was caught trying to smuggle heroin to him in a Folgers coffee can.

Christopher Obermiller, who was doing time for having sex with a 14-year-old girl, claims he never asked girlfriend Tara Shupback to bring him smack, only coffee.

She did it to 'screw him' after he began exchanging letters with another woman, he told police.

'She probably thought I needed heroin
 because she knew I used to be a heroin addict,' said Obermiller, 24, according to court documents.

He has been in Bay County Jail since May after he was arrested for violating his probation from a 2012 conviction for criminal sexual conduct.

Shupback claims Obermiller had begged her to smuggle drugs for him, according to the Bay City Times. She told investigators he once asked her to try putting the narcotic Suboxone in her letters to him.

'He's been bugging me the whole time he's been in jail,' Shupback, 22, told police.

She was busted Monday when she dropped off a plastic can of Folgers for Obermiller containing a hypodermic needle and a small plastic package with heroin.

Jail employees noticed the can was no longer vacuum-sealed and had glue around the rim, Captain Troy Stewart told MailOnline.

Even if the can did contain coffee, family members are not allowed to bring food in for inmates. Coffee and other treats must be purchased directly from the jail, the captain added.

Obermiller pleaded guilty in 2011 to a felony charge for having sex with a 14-year-old girl he met online. At the time, his attorney claimed the girl had told Obermiller she was 16, which is the age of consent in Michigan.

He was sentenced to three years probation in 2012. He was sent to Bay County Jail in May for violating the conditions of his release, according to Troy.

Obermiller faces up to 10 more years in prison on the drug charge.
