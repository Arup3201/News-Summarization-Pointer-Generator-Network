Celebrated contemporary artist Jeff Koons is not making any friends with his new neighbors.

The 59-year-old has caused a major uproar in a quiet street on New York's Upper East Side, after controversial construction plans to build of the city's biggests homes received the green light.

Most expensive living artist: Jeff Koons is controversially building one of New York's biggest homes

Koons - who is renowned for his pop culture sculptures and has an estimated net worth of $100 million - bought two separate brownstones on E. 67th St in 2009.

After years of toing and froing with the Department of Buildings to gut and merge the houses to create a mega-mansion - with a combined interior square footage of 21,726 - with the plans have now been approved and contruction has already started, Page Six reported.

The rennovations will bring down the square footage to 19, 325 and is estimated to cost $4.85 million.

Original plans drawn up by architect Richard Olcott of Ennead Architects filed in 2010 featured a pool, gym and maids quarters.

However they were rejected.

The new plans were approved last year and were drawn up by Peter Pennoyer, who worked on the Warhol Factory.

A permit for the full rennovation was issued on April 9, much to the chagrin of local residents.

'They’re always blocking the street with no regard for the neighbors,' one told The New York Post.

'It's reckless.

'At first we rolled our eyes.

'Now we're practically ready to organize neighborhood protests.'

A local renter suggested the rennovations came as a result of Koons' own influence.

'It must be nice to not only be an artist but to be your own Medici,' the renter told The Post.

Koons bought one of the buildings, at No. 13 E. 67th St, from the estate of Barbara Rockefeller.

He was not yet spoken of the renovations.

Koons holds the record for getting the highest price for a work by any living artist.

His Balloon Dog (Orange) - a 10-foot-tall stainless-steel structure - went for $58.4 million last year.

Last year, Koons became the most expensive living artist, when his Balloon Dog (Orange) - a 10 feet tall stainless steel sculpture - sold for $58.4 million at auction

Paintings and sculptures of American sculptor and painter Jeff Koons are exhibited in Whitney Museum in New York, United States on 25 June, 2014

The price of Koons' pieces are excepted to boom following his Whitney exhibition, which is a retrospective look at his career

His prices are expected to spike further following an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which is now showing.

Jeff Koons: A Retrospective is the most comprehensive exhibition of the artist's work — and the Whitney's final show at its Madison Avenue location before moving downtown to a Renzo Piano-designed building in 2015.

The display is believed to be worth close to $1 billion.
