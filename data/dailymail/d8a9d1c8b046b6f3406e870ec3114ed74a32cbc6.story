After fleeing a city tower block in search of the good life, Matthew Lepley and Jules Smith spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land in a bid to build Britain’s greenest home.

Armed with an axe and hand tools, they pieced together scrap metal, tyres and wooden crates until a one-bedroom cabin – complete with compost toilet – rose out of the muddy field they had bought.

Now the couple have been served with an enforcement notice to tear it all down – because it was against their eco-friendly beliefs to apply for planning permission.

Planning row: Officials from Torridge District Council have now said that the home must be torn down

(In)convenience: The couple have an outdoor compost toilet

They argue that the process would have wasted too much paper and energy.

Mr Lepley, 34, said: ‘We wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature.

‘The
 process was a lot slower but it was extremely satisfying. We wanted to 
reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. We took the decision to 
build without planning permission because the council’s procedure is not
 environmentally  friendly enough and it goes against our personal 
principles.’

Five years 
ago, Mr Lepley and 54-year-old partner Miss Smith left jobs as carers 
and moved out of the tower block in Wood Green, north London, where they
 were living.

They bought a 
20-acre field in Beaworthy, Devon, put aside £20,000 for construction 
costs, and set about scouring farmland and scrap yards for unwanted 
materials which they could use to build their home.

Heating: Mr Lepley stokes with wood-burning stove to keep the house warm

Happy scrubbing: The couple's bathroom gets heated water from a wood-fired tank

At one with nature: The couple keeps ducks, which provide eggs, and also have sheep for wool and a vegetable plot

They
 built foundations out of tractor tyres filled with gravel and used 
haulage pallets and railway sleepers to construct the walls and roof.  

Today the house is made up of just one bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom.

Water is drawn out of the ground via a bore hole and they use an outdoor compost toilet.

And
 just like Barbara and Tom from BBC sitcom The Good Life they grown 
their own fruit and veg and rear animals – ducks for their eggs and 
sheep for their wool.

Because
 they have no electricity, they keep their food cool in an underground 
‘fridge’ – a compartment dug two and a half feet deep.  

The couple say their neighbours were initially supportive of their ambition to live self-sufficiently.

They
 were relying on locals not alerting the council to their project so 
they would be given automatic planning permission after four years. But 
two years into the build, the couple say locals changed their tune when 
they revealed plans to run an eco-friendly retreat and host green 
workshops in their field.

Order: Torridge District Council in Devon have told the couple they must tear the house down

Handiwork: Mr Lepley and Ms Smith decided against using power tools for the whole of the five-year construction period

Resourceful: The wood to make the house was partly sourced from old lorry crates

A neighbour gathered ten signatures and submitted the petition to Torridge District Council.

Mr
 Lepley and Miss Smith appealed against the first enforcement notice 
three years ago and are now in the process of appealing against the 
second one. Mr Lepley, who earns a living selling homemade produce and 
doing part-time care work, said: ‘What we’ve done isn’t illegal.

‘We’ve
 had a lot of drama with the neighbours. Some have been really 
supportive while others have gone against us and started a petition.

‘The
 idea of the conservation project was to provide retreat accommodation 
and run courses and workshops on sustainable living.  The house and 
surrounding land enables us to be totally self-sufficient. This life is 
not for everyone but we love it. We would be devastated if we had to 
knock down.’

A council 
spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Torridge District Council has served an 
enforcement notice that they remove the structure.

‘However, as it has now gone to appeal, we have to wait for the inspector’s decision before we can take any further action.’
