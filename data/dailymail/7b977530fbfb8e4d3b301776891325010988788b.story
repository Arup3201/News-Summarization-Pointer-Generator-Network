Roger Federer let out a huge roar after winning his first Shanghai Masters title with a straight sets victory over unseeded Gilles Simon in China yesterday.

The Swiss world No 3 beat the Frenchman 7-6, 7-6 but was quick to appreciate how fortunate he was to reach the final after saving five match points in his second-round clash with Leonardo Mayer.

‘I got very, very lucky,’ said Federer, referring to his escape against Mayer in which he made 57 unforced errors. ‘I know what a privilege it is to be here today.’

Federer leads the tour this season in match wins (61), wins against players in the top 10 (13) and final appearances (nine) and today he will leap Rafael Nadal to become world No 2 for the first time in more than a year.

‘The biggest concern was to be healthy this year,’ Federer said after winning his fourth title of the season.

‘That’s something I’m just so pleased about, to see that the hard work I put in last year is paying off. Not only is it paying off, but I’m feeling good, I’m waking up normal. I’m not half broken like I was last year.

‘I’m enjoying myself on the tennis court. I’m playing the way I was hoping I could play again.’

Federer (right) didn’t play the cleanest match yesterday, though, even with the roof on the stadium closed due to the extremely windy conditions.

The 17-time major winner finished with 36 unforced errors to 21 winners, but he was the more aggressive player, constantly attacking the net behind crisp approach shots and forcing Simon to try to pass.

‘He still has the same strengths, this fantastic serve and this huge forehand,’ Simon said. ‘Now I know him, so I’m not scared any more when I have to play him. But it’s still so hard to beat him.’

World No 29 Simon was attempting to become the lowest-ranked player to win a Masters title since world No 50 Tomas Berdych captured the Paris title in 2005.

American twins Bob and Mike Bryan became the first pair to win all nine ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments after taking the men’s doubles title.

The 35-year-olds defeated French Open champions Julien Benneteau and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-2, 7-6 for their 101st career title in their 152nd final.

The Masters 1000 events are the top ranking tournaments on the ATP Tour outside of the grand slams and the Bryans now boast 31 victories after multiple wins in Indian Wells, Paris, Rome, Monte Carlo, Miami, Toronto, Madrid and Cincinnati.

They also won the now-defunct Hamburg Masters in 2007.
