Boris Johnson today revealed his 'sympathy' for Prince Andrew over US court claims he had sex with an under-age girl.

The London Mayor hailed the Duke of York for doing a 'huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country'.

It follows four days of torrid headlines for the prince after the allegations emerged in court papers on Friday.

Andrew has been accused of abusing a girl 'procured' for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.

The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. 

She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein.

Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations in three statements. 

Today, Mr Johnson expressed his support for the Prince. Speaking on LBC radio, he said: 'Prince Andrew, let’s be very clear, is a guy who does a huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country and people, they go on and on about air miles and so on – actually, I’ve seen that guy get out there and sell this country, try and help British firms to get business around the world. 

'He does a huge amount of good and a huge amount of hard work. So if you ask me whether I have sympathy for him, of course I do.' 

He added that the prince is a 'familiar and welcome figure in governments and countries around the world, because he helps to open doors'. 

Mr Johnson went on: 'We may think it's bizarre, but somebody who is the second son of the Queen is felt, in many parts of the world, to be an interesting and significant figure, and they want to receive him cordially. 

'And people who come with him are...they want to hear what business suggestions they have. And so I think that, you know, people should respect that side of his work.' 

David Cameron, meanwhile, failed to offer his public support to the Prince over the allegations. 

In an interview by the radio station LBC for Heart FM Wales, the Prime Minister said: ‘I’m not going to make any comment on it. Obviously, the Prince has made his own views very, very clear, and I think I’ll leave it at that.’

Andrew, who spent last week holidaying in a chalet in Verbier the chalet, flew back to the UK by private jet on Sunday afternoon with Eugenie. 

Sources say there are no immediate plans for him to travel to Norfolk, where the Queen is in residence until early February, although it was indicated they had spoken by phone.

Sarah Ferguson has launched an extraordinary defence of her former husband Prince Andrew, describing him as 'the greatest man there is'.  

The Duchess of York has kept a low profile at the luxury Swiss ski chalet where she has been holidaying with Andrew and their younger daughter Eugenie.

Sarah Ferguson has come out in defence of her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, insisting: 'He is the greatest man there is.' The Duchess of York has stayed on at the ski resort where she and the Duke were staying with family and friends when the sex scandal broke last week

But she emerged from the £22,000-a-week chalet and went for a mountain walk dressed in black sportswear.

Choosing her words carefully, she declined to comment directly on the scandal engulfing her former husband.

Asked by the Daily Mail if she was sticking by the Duke, she replied: ‘The York family is a tight unit. We’ve always been a tight unit.

‘He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married him. He is a great man, the best man in the world.’ 

It is understood that the prince has been fashioning a battle plan with his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, a former banker who has been trying to rebuild his public image as an unofficial champion for British business. 

Royal lawyers Harbottle and Lewis have also been on speed-dial and have written to the British media reminding them of Andrew’s categorical denials of the allegations against him.

Privately, aides continue to insist it is ‘business as usual’ for the prince, whose next public appearance is likely to be at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21. It is believed that he will also host a reception there in his personal capacity on behalf of business leaders, as he has done in previous years.

A source said: ‘The duke is nothing if not resilient and will not go to ground.’
