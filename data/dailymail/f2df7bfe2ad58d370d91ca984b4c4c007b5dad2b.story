Six years after his daughter was adopted without his knowledge or consent, Robert Manzanares is getting to spend spring break with her.

Mr Manzanares has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she born, but despite a Utah court dismissing the adoption two years ago, the case is still not over.

When the case went back to a Colorado court however, the judge ruled that Mr Manzanares should share custody with his daughter's adoptive parents.

Legal fight: Robert Manzanares is pushing for full custody of his daughter after her adoption was dismissed but a judge ruled she should remain with the couple she was given to

'Basically, I've got out-of-state father visitation,' he told Mail Online. 'I was hoping for sole custody. It was a little shocking that they ruled for joint.

'The danger is they're ignoring my constitutional rights to my daughter,' he added. 'It's like what they are saying is if a case is in court long enough, the child will probably stay in the new home.

'One of the problems, through all this 
fraud and lies is they are given primary care and no attention is paid to
 how she got [to be with the adopted family]. It has tainted her relationship with me, her father.'

The court in Colorado who ruled for joint custody stated that Kaia's adoptive family were her 'psychological parents' because theirs is the only home she has known.

The process in which Kaia came to be given away despite Mr Manzanares' requests for custody before she was born, led Utah to dismiss the adoption because of fraud.

The ruling means that Mr Manzanares has been forced to appeal the decision, leaving him and his daughter in a legal limbo that keeps them apart.

Currently he has shared parental rights, meaning he is involved with decisions about her life and education, but Kaia remains living with her adoptive family.

The confusing case and Mr Manzanares fight for the right to bring up his daughter, began when his partner told him she was pregnant and that she wanted to give the baby away.

Even after they separated during her pregnancy, Mr Manzanares tried to remain as involved as possible and helped financially.

Questions: Robert Manzanares says as his daughter, Kaia, gets older it gets harder to explain why she isn't living with her father

But, on the same day he filed a paternity petition in a Colorado court, his ex-girlfriend was signing adoption papers for their daughter in Utah.

He only discovered his baby had been born prematurely when a friend called to say his ex-girlfriend had returned to work and was no longer pregnant.

On the advice of her Bishop, his ex had been told if she let the little girl be adopted by a Mormon family she would be accepted back into the church.

Kaia was adopted by the woman's brother - a situation that makes the custody battle even more confusing for the child.

'It's very hard on her and had to try to explain who her real family is. We tell her we all love her and want to be part of her life,' Mr Manzanares, who is not Mormon, said.

'It gets harder and harder as she gets smarter and smarter. It will be hard on her to read the public records.'

He added that the details of the protracted custody battle are all easily available, meaning that as his daughter grows up she will easily be able to find them.

What will also be hard for her to come to terms with is that her biological mother, who she knows as an aunt, had another child after Kaia was born, and decided to keep that baby.

For Mr Manzanares however, all that matters is spending as much time as possible with Kaia, and working to get full custody of her.

The latest - and hopefully final - appeal has been filed, and supporters of the family are able to make donations to a Go Fund Me page to help towards the legal costs.

He is also suing the state of Utah and his ex-girlfriend and her family for allowing the adoption to go ahead despite him making it clear that he wanted to raise his own daughter.
