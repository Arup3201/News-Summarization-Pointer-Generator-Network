Sauvignon Blanc - the white wine that smells of gooseberries - is Britain's favourite plonk, according to new research.

It pipped Chardonnay, our second most popular, in the first 'Grape Britain' wine map, based on the tastes of more than 400,000 drinkers.

The study of sales data at Laithwaite's Wine also revealed more Champagne bottles are popped in the well heeled City of London and Westminster than anywhere else.

And residents of the seaside resort town of Bournemouth, known for its high number of pensioners, like to paint the town red with a glass or two of Merlot and Malbec.

Meanwhile, Liverpudlians like to add a bit of sparkle to their lives with the city uncovered as the capital of Prosecco, while Cabernet Sauvignon flies off the shelves in Slough.

Glasses of Champagne are sunk in the well heeled City of London and Westminster than anywhere else

The analysis of more than a hundred grape varieties and wine regions found Sauvignon Blanc, made from green grapes, came out on top as the most popular wine in almost every British town, city and county. 

Only Berkshire bucks the trend, drinking more of our second favourite grape, Chardonnay.

But the dominance of the two big hitters paints just half the picture because in the last year Laithwaite's, the UK's largest home delivery wine merchant, has sold wines made from more than 40 different single grape varieties.

A closer look at the figures reveals our wine tastes are far more varied and diverse. The researchers found Glasgow has the greatest penchant for spicy red Grenache, with the highest proportion of bottles sold here. 

Trendy Hammersmith and Fulham is keeping Beaujolais Nouveau fashionable, and Rosé is most at home in Ramsgate.

When it comes to sparkling, Liverpool came out on top as the city with the highest percentage of Prosecco drinkers, while unsurprisingly, Champagne flutes are filling up most frequently in the City of London and Westminster.

Laithwaite's buyer Beth Willard said: 'It is great to be able to draw up the first 'Grape Britain' wine map. 

'What it shows is that, while Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay have a huge nationwide appeal, we are actually a nation of wine connoisseurs, with our own unique tastes

'We have seen a slight shift in the nation's palate over the last few years to wines made from lesser known varieties and from less mainstream regions.

'Wines from Romania and Hungary are becoming more popular than traditional favourites like Italian Pinot Grigio. Sauvignon Blanc's dominance at the top of that list might soon be challenged.'
