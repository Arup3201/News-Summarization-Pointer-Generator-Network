The Queen's beloved corgis are fed a luxury diet of fillet steak and chicken breast cooked by a chef, a new book claims.

The carefully prepared meals are then delivered by a footman and covered with gravy which is poured by the monarch herself. 

Royal biographer Brian Hoey claims that the dogs eat at 5pm sharp every day at Buckingham Palace, in his book Pets by Royal Appointment.

They do not eat until the Queen herself has given the royal command for them to begin their meals, the Sunday Times reports.

The dogs never eat tinned food and have even been given homeopathic remedies when they are ill, he said.

The Queen's love of corgis was said to have been sparked on her eighteenth birthday, when she was given a Pembroke corgi named Susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred.

Some were mated with dachshunds - most notably Pipkin, who belonged to Princess Margaret - to create ‘dorgis’.

The puppy was given to the Queen on her 18th birthday by King George VI, and her gravestone calls her 'the faithful companion of the Queen', an epitaph which is also used on the headstones of two of her descendants, Sugar and Heather.

Susan was said to be so beloved by the Queen that she went on honeymoon with her and Prince Philip in 1947.

At present, The Queen owns two corgis, Willow and Holly, and two dorgis, Candy and Vulcan, which travel with her to her various residences.

The most recent death in the Queen's menagerie is that of 13-year-old Monty, who starred with Her Majesty in the James Bond sketch for the Olympics opening ceremony.

However, he was laid to rest at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where he died. 

When at Buckingham Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a special boot room near the royal apartments, where they wander freely. 

At Balmoral, the young Elizabeth would take the Corgis out onto the moor to help find grouse.

However, although the corgis were expert at locating the shot birds in the heather, they had difficulty retrieving them. So she would watch them wind the game and then rush over to retrieve the grouse herself.

The Queen thinks of the names for all the puppies at the kennels. One of her current labradors, Gryffindor, is from a litter named after Harry Potter characters.

Mr Hoey has said The Queen has a very hands on approach in all aspects of her dogs' lives. As a child she and Princess Margaret would feed their pet corgi by hand from a bowl, he said.

She has also apparently joked that when breeding the dogs with dachshunds she gives them a hand by 'putting them on a brick' as they are shorter in the leg.

The Royal family is well known for their love of dogs, but Mr Hoey said the Duke of Edinburgh 'loathes' corgis 'because they yap too much'. He and Prince Edward prefer labradors, and Prince Andrew is fond of Norfolk terriers.

The writer also lists a few of the more unusual anImals gifted to the family by other world leaders, including an elephant from Cameroon and a baby crocodile from Gambia.

But Hoey said: 'Royals have long had an aversion to cats. They have no affection for cats.'
