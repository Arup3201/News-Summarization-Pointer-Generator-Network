The chief executives of Blackberry maker Research In Motion have both stepped down as the once-iconic firm struggles to survive in an increasingly competitive market.

Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis announced last night that they have quit their roles as co-CEOs and co-chairmen at the Canadian company.

The development comes a month after RIM delayed the release of new phones deemed critical to the firm's future until late this year.

Its PlayBook tablet, RIM's answer
to the Apple iPad, failed to gain consumer support, forcing the company
to deeply discount it to move the devices off store shelves.

RIM has  has lost tens of billions in market value, from a high of $70billion a few years ago to a current market value of $8.9billion.

It has been a rapid turnaround - just
three years ago, the firm landed the number one spot on Fortune 
magazine's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.

Research in Motion’s first BlackBerry handsets appeared in 1999, and were only available to business users.

Starting as two-way pagers, the handsets rapidly added 'push email' - email which arrived as it was sent.

This service was nearly unique - other early smartphones tended to only collect email when users pressed a button to do so.

BlackBerry became popular with business IT departments because email was secure and easily manageable remotely.

The first handsets had black-and-white screens and offered few extras, but the 'always-on' email became an instant hit with business people and BlackBerrys fast became a cult status symbol. 

Later BlackBerry handsets were more consumer-focused, with the company’s secure – and free – messenger service BBM becoming a hit with teenagers.

Consumer handsets included the slim BlackBerry Pearl and an ill-fated touchscreen, Storm – and included Pay-as-you-Go handsets.

In 2009, America’s Fortune magazine named RIM as the fastest-growing company on Earth.

But the firm’s handsets failed to keep up with the app-heavy approach of rivals iOS and Android, and market share slumped as more versatile iPhone and Android handsets became consumer favourites.

BlackBerry’s attempt to enter the tablet market, the Playbook, was crippled by poor design – the tablet required a BlackBerry phone paired via Bluetooth to access email – and was sold at a discount. 

New BlackBerry handsets such as the Torch felt dated next to Apple and Google devices and a promised new operating system hit delays, with hi-tech new touchscreens promised, but never delivered.

Balsillie and Lazaridis have been replaced by Thorsten Heins, a chief operating officer who joined RIM four years ago from Siemens AG.

RIM turned the email smartphone into a ubiquitous device that many could not live without.

But users have moved on to flashier 
touch-screen phones such as Apple's iPhone and various competing models 
that run Google's Android software.

Many shareholders and analysts have said a change or sale of the company has been needed, but the sudden departure of the two founders was not expected despite their promises that they would examine the co-CEO and co-chairmen structure.

Mr Balsillie and Mr Lazaridis have long been celebrated as Canadian heroes, even appearing in the country's citizenship guide for new immigrants as models of success.

They headed the Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM together since its inception in 1984.

In a statement, Mr Lazaridis said: 'There comes a time in the growth of every successful company when the founders recognise the need to pass the baton to new leadership.

'Jim and I went to the board and told them that we thought that time was now.'

Mr Lazaridis will take on a new role as vice chairman of RIM's board and chairman of the board's new innovation committee, while Mr Balsillie remains a member of the board.

Both remain two of RIM's biggest shareholders.

Mr Balsillie said: 'I agree this is the right time to pass the baton to new leadership, and I have complete confidence in Thorsten, the management team and the company.

'I remain a significant shareholder and a director and, of course, they will have my full support.'

Analysts have said RIM's future depends on its much-delayed new software platform as RIM has tried and failed to reinvigorate the BlackBerry.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in late 2010 that RIM would have a hard time catching up to Apple because it has been forced to move beyond its area of strength and into unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company.

Mr Heins, 54, said his predecessor took RIM in the right direction and that he is committed to the new software.

He said: 'We are more confident than ever that was the right path.

'It is Mike and Jim's continued unwillingness to sacrifice long-term value for short-term gain which has made RIM the great company that it is today.

'I share that philosophy and am very excited about the company's future.'

Barbara Stymiest, a former chief operating officer of the Royal Bank of Canada who has been a member of RIM's board since 2007, has named chair of the board of directors.

RIM also announced that Prem Watsa, the chief executive of Fairfax Financial Holdings, is a new board member. Mr Watsa has become a significant shareholder.

Mr Lazaridis said he was so confident in the future direction of the company that he intends to purchase an additional $50million of the company's shares on the open market.

RIM was worth more than $70billion a few years ago but now has a market value of $8.9billion.

The company still has 75million active subscribers, but many analysts believe RIM will lose market share internationally as it has in the U.S.

Market researcher NPD Group said RIM's market share of smartphones in the U.S. declined from 44 per cent in 2009 to 10 per cent in 2011.

Mr Balsillie acknowledged in December that the last few quarters have been among the most challenging times in the company's history.
