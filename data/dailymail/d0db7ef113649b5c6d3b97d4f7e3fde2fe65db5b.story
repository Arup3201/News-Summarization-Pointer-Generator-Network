The US Presbyterian Church  has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate.

The church, which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest Presbyterian denomination, made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change.

Its revised constitution will now read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' as opposed to just a man and woman previously.

'Finally, the church in its constitutional documents fully recognizes that the love of gays and lesbian couples is worth celebrating in the faith community,' Rev. Brian D. Ellison, executive director of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which advocates gay inclusion in the church, told the New York Times. 

'There is still disagreement, and I don’t mean to minimize that, but I think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together.'

The new language, which was approved by the church's General Assembly last year, had  to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies.

A grouping of congregations in the state of New Jersey became the 86th body to do just that Tuesday.

The decision is likely to drive a further wedge between Presbyterian USA members, who have taken opposite sides on the issue.

The church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues.

That being said, the fact that some many members who were against same-sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church.

At last year's Presbyterian General Assembly, the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed.

'These decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others,' Gradye Parsons, stated clerk of the General Assembly, said at the time.

The Presbyterians' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the Roman Catholic church, the biggest single denomination among Americans, and fundamentalist Evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage.

In 2011, the Presbyterian Church USA voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy.

The constitution's new wording will take effect on June 21.
