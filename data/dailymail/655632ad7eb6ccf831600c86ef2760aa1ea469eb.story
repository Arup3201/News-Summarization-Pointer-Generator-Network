A disturbing video has shown the debilitating effect a drug known as ‘liquid fantasy’ had on three tradies after they decided to sample it with a few beers after work.

Moans and groans come from one of the men who is seen lying in the foetal position on the wooden floor in his high-vis top and boots, kicking his leg on the floor, in footage due to be shown on Channel 10’s Gold Coast Cops.

Another man is restrained by police after he turned violent and lashed out at staff in the pub, having taken the GHB drug which is often used in date rape cases.

At least four officers are seen trying to pin him down as ambulance staff look on during the incident that happened at a busy Surfers Paradise venue in August.

‘GHB affects people differently and the other two males we were talking to were fine and then five minutes later it hit them,’ said one of the Queensland Police officers in the show.

‘It definitely messes with their mind, it does weird things to their head, and they go in and out of consciousness or different degrees of violence. It just changes a person.’

Paramedics and police were quickly on the seen after one of the men turned violent

When mixed with alcohol the depressant effects of both substances are increased, which may lead to respiratory problems.

In the video on officer can be heard asking the man on the floor in the recovery position: ‘Are you still with us buddy?’

The officer reveals: ‘He reckons he took three pills, straight up.’

Meanwhile, just metres away - where another man is on the floor - an ambulance worker says: ‘This guy has to go to hospital; he’s had more than just fantasy.’

The tradie is then seen being stretchered into an ambulance.

One of the knocked out tradies was handcuffed as a precautionary measure, while another was restrained.

Police later charged one of the men with disorderly conduct in a licensed venue, the Courier Mail reports.

Liquid fantasy is another name for GHB, a colourless, odourless, bitter or salty liquid, that is known for being used in date rape cases. It is an anaesthetic-type drug that renders the victim physically incapacitated. It is usually swallowed but is also sometimes injected

It’s depressant drug that slows down the messages travelling between the brain and body. Effects last for around three to four hours and can include feelings of euphoria, increased sex drive, lowered inhibitions, memory lapses, drowsiness, clumsiness, dizziness or headache, lowered temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, tremors, nausea, diarrhoea and urinary incontinence.

It’s very easy to take an overdose - especially when used with alcohol - and when that happens symptoms also include hallucinations, seizures, blackouts and death.

GHB is typically consumed by the capful or teaspoonful at a cost of $5 to $10 per dose.
