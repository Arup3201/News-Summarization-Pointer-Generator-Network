A mystery man guaranteed a Merry Christmas for dozens of poor families after he walked into a shop and spent more than $1000 paying off total strangers' layaway items.

The layaway department at the Missoula Kmart was full of items that were unlikely to be given as presents this year, because their would-be buyers were late with their payments.

That's until the generous Secret Santa dropped in on Tuesday afternoon and anonymously paid down the balance on dozens of gifts.

Brenda Warren, a worker at the Missoula Kmart's layaway department, told KPAX News: 'He walked in and wanted to pay on some lay-aways and I asked him, "which ones?"

'He said some that weren't going to have Christmas and were late on their payment.

'I'm like, "really?" [I thought] maybe [he'd] just pay off one or two, but then he ended up paying the whole list, so it was just amazing.'

To her delight, Ms Warren then had the task of calling all the customers whose presents were waiting in the shop.

She told KPAX that most were excited, some shocked, and one man incredulous to the point that he actually hung up the phone on her.

It is just the latest in a spate of copycat Secret Santas to have struck across the U.S. as economic problems risk making this Christmas on of the least cheerful in a generation.

Shops in Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska and 
California have all reported random acts of kindness from individuals 
coming in to pay off the balance on layaway items.

Mary Chapin, who had her $180 layaway ticket paid off in Michigan, told Deseret News yesterday that the anonymous donation had 'restored her faith in people'.

The money bought toys for her 12-year-old son.

Missoula Kmart's mystery man told Ms Warren he was visiting from Michigan, where had made a similar stop at the Kmart there.

He doesn't have any family, he said, and playing Santa makes his Christmas.
