The best thing about the 19 wickets Moeen Ali has picked up in four Tests against India is the speed with which he has improved.

No newcomer to Test cricket already has the perfect game, otherwise they’d have been picked years ago. It’s why we need to give a bit more leeway to the likes of Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan. Of course there’s a gap between them and the experienced new-ball pairing of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. That’s how it works!

But what is so exciting about Moeen is that he has taken on board some of the criticisms of the way he was bowling in the first half of the summer, and now looks much more settled at Test level.

Much-improved: Moeen Ali wheels away in celebration after taking the wicker of India captain MS Dhoni

A lot has been made of the chat he had with Ian Bell during a practice session before the third Test at the Ageas Bowl — and rightly so. Bell basically told him he felt Moeen was bowling in Test matches like he was in the nets, mixing up his variations and not finding a consistent pace. He suggested Moeen bowl a little more quickly out in the middle, and that seems to have made a lot of difference.

We saw on Saturday in Manchester, for example, that Mooen is now harder to get down the pitch to because the ball is arriving that little bit earlier; when MS Dhoni tried to hit him over the top, he ended up dragging one to midwicket. Moeen’s gone from bowling around 50mph at the start of the season to over 55mph. It’s been a crucial change of gear.

But it’s one thing to listen to a piece of advice — it’s another to implement it successfully. It shows the lad has a great capacity to learn and improve, as well as all the elements you need to be a good off-spinner; he spins the ball, he gets drift and he can beat the bat on both sides.

And he’s eradicating the one bad ball an over that we saw in his first couple of games. That said, let’s not go over the top. Yes, Moeen has shed the part-time tag. But he’s still not the next Graeme Swann. I would still prefer to see him as a batsman who bowls, and I hope this doesn’t make English cricket lazy as they try to produce more spin bowlers.

There are still problems out there. The moment a county pitch turns, the pitch inspectors perk up, whereas if a team are skittled on a greentop, no-one bats an eyelid. We need more spinning pitches and maybe more cricket needs to be played at outgrounds, which have traditionally turned more than pitches at county HQs.

What Moeen has done is buy English cricket breathing space, but it would still be great to unearth a Test-class left-arm spinner now the Monty Panesar era seems to have come and gone.

As for the way India have played Moeen, they’ve been abysmal. I was amazed to see some stats the other day about their batsmen’s record over the past couple of years against off-spin; only Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin had decent stats.

This is supposed to be a country that produces wonderful players of slow bowling, but one of the theories I’ve heard while doing commentary with the Indian broadcasters is that these big-name stars spend all their time being bombed by opposition fast bowlers and no time at all playing spinners back home in domestic four-day cricket.

It seems weird to be sitting here and lecturing Indian batsmen on how to play an English ‘offie’, but it looks as if they’ve resorted to hit or block, with nothing in between.

Taking things on board: Ian Bell gave Ali advice before the third Test and the impact has been remarkable

They should sit down and watch some videos of how Rahul Dravid played Swann in 2011.

He would go right forward or right back, and use his hands and feet to combat the turn and manoeuvre both the ball and the field.

I also think they play a pre-DRS brand of cricket, with the bat close to the pad. As Cheteshwar Pujara found out on Saturday, umpires are now giving those out on the front foot — even if he was a touch unlucky.

But hats off to Moeen. He has learned quickly and forced errors out of them. Watching his progress has been one of the joys of the summer.

As a result he looks much more settled playing at Test level for England

Before the third Test, Ian Bell took him aside and told him to be more consistent with his deliveries and pace rather than mixing things up
