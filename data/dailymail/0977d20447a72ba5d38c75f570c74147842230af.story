Naked calenders are usually the preserve of glamorous models in alluring poses.

And while this calender by NHS staff may be suggestive, it certainly isn't full of your typical racy shots.

But what they lack in rock-hard abs and brooding gazes, the male staff from Wansbeck General Hospital more than compensate with cheeky smiles - and lots of hilarious poses.

Hats off to you! Scores of male colleagues from Wansbeck General Hospital stripped off to encourage men to check themselves each month

Cheeky! Mr February dons nothing but a hat, a wristband and a cheeky pose for this month

Mind the gap: These cheeky staff are all smiles as they urge men to check their testicles for signs of change

Squeaky clean: The staff are trying to raise awareness about testicular cancer, which is often a taboo subject

The colleagues from the hospital in Ashington, Northumberland, bared all for the naked charity calendar to raise awareness of testicular cancer.

They used medical equipment - along with cowboy hats and industrial floor cleaners - to strategically cover their private parts.  

Reception and domestic staff, healthcare assistants, senior nurses, doctors and A&E consultants, all posed for pictures used in the calendar.

We can see everything! Testicular cancer is one of the most curable and early diagnosis can mean a cure rate of 98 per cent

Phil Stamp, a consultant in accident and emergency at Wansbeck General Hospital, said: 'Testicular cancer commonly affects young blokes and it can be particularly embarrassing for people to talk about it.

'The calendar is a fun way of raising awareness of the condition.

'If young blokes just happen to glance at the calendar and check themselves then it is worth doing it as early diagnosis of the condition saves lives.'

Craig Leathard, charge nurse at Wansbeck General Hospital, who lives in Ashington, has been the driving force behind the calendar campaign.

Grin and bare it: Reception and domestic staff, healthcare assistants, senior nurses, doctors and A&E consultants, all posed for pictures

The naked A&E charity calendar will be sold in Hospital Volunteer Shops at Wansbeck, North Tyneside and Hexham general hospitals

Close shave: The eye-popping calender can be bought with a minimum donation of £5 which will go towards male cancer charity Orchid and the hospital charity Bright Northumbria to help fund research and care for cancer patients

Now that's a gift for the senses! These men donned Santa hats - and not much else - to celebrate the end of the year

He said: 'There is already widespread awareness amongst women about breast cancer and we wanted to do something to put testicular cancer on the map too – for men it’s just as important for us to check our balls as it is for women to check their breasts.

'If you find a lump or swelling, or notice any change at all downstairs – whether or not it’s painful – then the very best thing you can do is get it checked out by your GP.

'Please don’t ignore it - testicular cancer is one of the most curable and as men we need to stop being so macho and make sure we check ourselves every month.'

Staff wanted to do something to put testicular cancer on the map too - and decided upon a cheeky calender

Testicular cancer is one of the most curable and early diagnosis can mean a cure rate of 98 per cent. 

Even cases of more advanced testicular cancer, where the cancer has spread outside the testicles to nearby tissue, have an 80 per cent chance of being cured.

It is often a taboo subject among those it most commonly affects – young men between 15 and 45 years old.

Testicular cancer is relatively uncommon, accounting for just 1 per cent of all cancers that occur in men.

Each year in the UK around 2,090 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer, according to Cancer Research UK.

The most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in the testicles. Other symptoms can include a dull ache in the scrotum (the sac of skin that hangs underneath the penis and contains the testicles) or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.

Builder Stephen Halliburton, from Blyth, Northumberland, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in December 2009 at the age of 45.

He went along to his GP after being prompted by an awareness campaign and discovering a lump in his testicles.

He was immediately diagnosed and within five days had an operation to remove the lump.

The father-of-two, who now has the all clear, said: 'I think it’s fantastic what the A&E staff are doing. If it wasn’t for an awareness campaign, I would never have checked myself and who knows where I would be now if I hadn’t.'

MP for Wansbeck, Ian Lavery is also supporting the calendar campaign.

He said: 'I think it is fantastic that so many staff from the Wansbeck A&E team have got behind the campaign to raise awareness of testicular cancer and get across a really important message for men across the North East.'

The naked A&E charity calendar will be sold in Hospital Volunteer Shops at Wansbeck, North Tyneside and Hexham general hospitals, for a minimum donation of £5 which will go towards male cancer charity Orchid and the hospital charity Bright Northumbria to help fund research and care for cancer patients.
