A freak accident left a college student unable to walk or speak after he fell out of bed and hit his head.

Clark Jacobs, 20, was asleep on January 10 when he plunged from his bed at college, hit the floor and fractured his skull, his relatives have told local media. 

Jacobs' family relayed the Georgia Tech student's ordeal in an interview with WSB-TV.

The college student's mother Mariellen Jacobs told WSB-TV 'We treated him [at home] for less than a day and decided to take him to the hospital because with stiff neck, we were afraid it might be meningitis.

'They did a CT scan and we realized he had fractured skull. He ended up having a fractured skull and a blood clot. 

'Unfortunately it led to a bleed in his brain and [doctors] had to do emergency surgery to save his life.'

She told the television station her son landed on linoleum. 

Clark Jacobs now cannot walk nor speak, WSB-TV reported. 

Ron Jacobs told WSB-TV that his son 'just climbed back into bed while sleeping.' 

The ABC affiliate station reported that Jacobs' fraternity house, where the accident took place, set up loft beds shortly before the fall - and now there are guardrails.

WSB-TV reported that Jacobs planned to work as a mechanical engineer. 

A GoFundMe page meant to raise funds for his treatment is now online, the television station pointed out.

On the fundraising page, his uncle Mike Jacobs wrote 'Clark’s recovery has been nothing short of remarkable – beating the medical odds again and again through a heartbreaking rolling coaster of emotions. 

His mom calls him "Superman," after his namesake, Clark Kent. He remains in a minimally conscious state and has a long road ahead of him, and his family will be by his side every step of the way as he fights his way back.'

The page is seeking $200,000 in donations.

'You deserve to know how your donation will be used,' Mike Jacobs wrote. 

'Your donation will go towards paying for the substantial uncovered long-term care costs associated with home nursing care for a minimally conscious patient. 

Clark’s parents will donate all excess donations to the nationally recognized Shepherd Center in Atlanta, where the amazing staff has been working with Clark on his road to recovery.'
