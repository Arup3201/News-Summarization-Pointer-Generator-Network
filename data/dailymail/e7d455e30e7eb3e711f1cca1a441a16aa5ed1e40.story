Sally Bercow made headlines in 2011 when she said that her husband John had become more attractive since becoming Speaker of the House of Commons.

Now he has offered his opinion on her claims - insisting that he is 'certainly not' a sex symbol.

Dismissing her comments as a joke, he spoke of her 'very good' sense of humour.

Sex symbol? Speaker John Bercow insists that he is not a sex symbol, despite his wife's claims that he had become more attractive. Dismissing the comments, he said simply that she has 'a very good sense of humour'

Making headlines: In 2011, Sally Bercow, pictured with her husband, spoke of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster. Mr Bercow said that they are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage

He told The Times Magazine: 'I have most 
certainly not become a sex symbol. She [his wife] does have a very good 
sense of humour.'

In 2011 Mrs Bercow sent ripples around Westminster when she appeared in a newspaper wearing nothing but a bedsheet.

She also spoke at the time of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster.

Mr Bercow said that they are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage, which has made headlines on a number of occasions.

He said: 'Sally and I have our own approach to marriage and we are perfectly comfortable in our own skin,' he said.

'And, in the politest possible way, I think I would say: if other people disapprove of it or think it should be otherwise, that's their problem, not ours.'

Rising above it: Mr Bercow, 51, who is 5ft 6in tall, said he was 'never bothered about being short' and said that those who comment on his height are being 'intellectually substandard and schoolboyish'

Mr Bercow, 51, who is 5ft 6in tall, said he was 'never bothered about being short'.

'Whereas nobody these days would regard it as acceptable to criticise someone on grounds of race or creed or disability or sexual orientation, somehow it seems to be acceptable to comment on someone's height, or lack of it.

'Does it affect me, personally? Not at all. It's just low grade, intellectually substandard and schoolboyish.'

In February Mrs Bercow, 44, said she 'can't wait' for her husband to quit his role as speaker so her private life will no longer be under the spotlight.
