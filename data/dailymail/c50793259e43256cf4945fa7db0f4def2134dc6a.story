A grandfather of seven spent three years thinking he could die at any time - after being wrongly diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

Hospital porter Roger Mollison, 66, of Dundee, was warned he had just nine months to live after tests appeared to show he had developed lethal mesothelioma, caused by exposure to asbestos.

He gave up his job and began chemotherapy in the hope of surviving. And in the following months he tried to make the most of the time he had left by spending it with his children and grandchildren.

One of his biggest fears was not living long enough to see his son get married. But he survived to attend the ceremony, and to see two new grandchildren and two great-grandchildren born.

Then, in March - almost three years after the original diagnosis at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee - he found his ‘cancer’ of the lungs was actually another non-life-threatening, asbestos-related condition.

Mr Mollison, who is also a father of two, said: ‘I've spent almost three years fearing I'd die any time and my family have suffered horribly. I prepared to not be around for much longer.

‘And [I] went through the awful feelings that go with that. Then I was shocked to the core when they told me the original lab results were wrong and I'm still trying to come to terms with it.

‘It is wonderful to know that I am not dying but I have lost all confidence in doctors and don't know if I ever will regain it.’

Mr Mollison began suffering breathing problems several years ago. He was admitted to Ninewells before being referred to a specialist who performed a biopsy.

Suspected mesothelioma was diagnosed - with exposure to asbestos in a previous job as an insulation engineer cited as a probable reason.

Mr Mollison believed he was to become one of the 2,000 UK men whose lives are claimed by the disease each year. Victims are normally expected to live between six and 18 months.

He was even visited by palliative care nurses who advised on how best to spend what time he had left. He agreed to undergo chemotherapy, and stunned staff in the oncology ward with his progress.

Almost all people who undergo chemotherapy experience side effects. Some are as follows:

Other possible side effects include bruising, bleeding, mucositis, loss of appetite, dry skin, memory and sleep problems, sexual issues, diarrhoea, constipation and depression

Mr Mollison said they labelled him ‘their best patient’ after discovering he was regularly going cycling in between treatment sessions.

The correct diagnosis only emerged after Mr Mollison instructed his lawyers, Digby Brown, to prepare a claim for compensation against the insurers of his former employers.

They sent him for fresh tests after becoming suspicious about the length of time he had lived since the diagnosis. The second opinion confirmed Mr Mollison was ‘unlikely to have mesothelioma’.

He said: ‘When I turned up for treatment staff at the oncology ward kept telling me I was their best patient.

‘My disease had not progressed to the end stage they expected and the truth only emerged when my lawyer questioned the diagnosis.’

His family say the ordeal of being told their husband, father and grandfather had only months to live has had a ‘horrendous’ impact.

His wife Liz said: ‘We are hugely relieved Roger is not desperately ill but devastated about what we all went through. Surely these hospital tests should always be checked and rechecked.’

His solicitor Euan Love, of Digby 
Brown, said: ‘The original pathologist said Mr Mollinson had 
mesothelioma which is caused by asbestos. But our independent 
pathologist's opinion says it is unlikely he does.

‘He
 has other asbestos related conditions not immediately life-threatening.
 It has been extremely traumatic for him and indeed his family.

‘We are discussing ways to resolve his case and obtain compensation for the asbestos-related conditions he does have and for what he has had to endure since his original diagnosis.’

Mr Mollison admits he is bitter about having to give up his hospital job after working there for six years.

He said: ‘I loved my job and would have stayed on much longer. However, the terminal diagnosis made me give it up because I had so little time left to spend it with my family.

‘My daughter, Lynsey, and son Neil, were heartbroken and struggled to accept that I was dying.

‘We now have to tell people that I no longer have this death sentence and everyone is just as stunned as us. It is a huge struggle to take it all but we have to move forward and cope.’

He has been supported throughout by Asbestos Action Tayside charity.

An NHS Tayside spokesman said: ‘Due to patient confidentiality, we cannot comment on individual cases. We would encourage Mr Mollison to contact us so we can look into his concerns further for him.’
