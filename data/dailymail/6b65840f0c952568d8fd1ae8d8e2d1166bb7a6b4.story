It is the racy publishing phenomenon that became the fastest selling 
paperback the UK has ever seen. Thanks to the Fifty Shades Of Grey effect, everything from sex toys to Christian Grey suit and tie ranges have been released by companies keen to cash in
on the torrid romance of protagonists Anastasia Steele and Christian 
Grey.

And now, with the Fifty Shades effect still rumbling on, one enterprising dominatrix has leapt on the bandwagon.

Georgina Wilde has transformed her so-called dominatrix's dungeon into a replica of Christian Grey's Red Room Of Pain - just as featured in the erotic trilogy - and she is renting it out to couples craving an edgier sexual experience at £263 a time.

Cashing in: One dominatrix is cashing in on the ever-booming Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon and has transformed her playroom into a Christian Grey style abode

Located in a Georgian townhouse just minutes from Oxford Circus and Regent’s Park, Georgina Wilde’s playroom comes fully equipped with a plethora of BDSM equipment and props.

With everything from floggers and 
paddles, to whipping benches and suspension devices, the space is 
designed to encourage couples to fulfil their most kinky fantasies.

Speaking
about her new business venture, Georgina said: 'BDSM has been around 
far longer than Fifty Shades Of Grey but the book has certainly 
mainstreamed the fetish industry.

'I’ve
had my dungeon for years as a rent by the hour studio, but the success 
of the book has put me on the radar of a whole new clientele and we’ve 
adapted the space accordingly.

'We’ve added a luxurious bed, overnight amenities and walls are even painted a deep shade of red like those in Christian Grey’s infamous playroom.

'It’s only been available on Wimdu.co.uk for a short time, but already the requests are pouring through from new customers and first timers. 

'The book has inspired people to get more adventurous in the bedroom and is removing the taboos which are normally associated with those who practise kink – it’s great for business.'

Wimdu CEO Arne Blackwenn added: 'Fifty Shades of Grey has taken the entire world by 
storm. We aim to provide our customers with 
properties that reflect all tastes.

'Wimdu.co.uk
is all about providing interesting, quality accommodation that offers 
an experience you wouldn’t receive in a regular hotel and our erotic 
getaways are no exception.'

Demand: The room, available on Wimdu.co.uk, has already seen a surge of interest by couples craving edgier sex
