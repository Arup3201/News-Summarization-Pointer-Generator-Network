Love is blind: Ceri Shipman went to extreme lengths to try and free her rapist boyfriend

The girlfriend of a convicted rapist tried to clear his name by framing two of his victims with fake Facebook profiles.

Ceri Shipman, 25, set up bogus accounts and used them to send messages supposedly from the women saying they had made up the allegations.

She acted after her boyfriend Jason Savage was jailed indefinitely for a string of violent rapes, being branded 'cold, calculating and sadistic' by a judge.

In an attempt to clear him, Shipman used the fake profiles to send herself messages from the women which 'admitted' to lying about the rapes.

One read: 'Maybe I did make up the rape but he broke my heart.'

Another said: 'You should have met up with us, lied and got comp.'

Believing the profiles were genuine, detectives arrested the two victims and questioned them at a police station for 13 hours.

The women had already endured the ordeal of giving evidence at the trial of Savage, 29, before he was jailed in 2010.

The victims were on police bail for four months as officers investigated Shipman's false claims, made six months after her boyfriend was sentenced.

She had accessed their real Facebook accounts and copied pictures and profiles into the fake ones to make them appear genuine.

Other messages read: 'Glad I met up with all them, we had a right good chat before court and look where it got him.'

Another read: 'Maybe we did lie but nothing you can do about it.' Shipman, of Hull, replied, posting: 'See what I mean, you lied and you just admitted it, how can you live with yourself?'

She told Humberside Police that the victims had made up the allegations and directed them to the social networking site.

But the cruel lies were eventually exposed and Shipman has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

At Hull Crown Court, Judge Michael Mettyear told the mother of one that she will be jailed after an adjournment for  probation reports.

He told her: 'You should be aware this is a very serious  matter and expect and plan for a custodial sentence.' When police seized her computer, they found images of the victims on it.

Savage was described as one of Britain's 'most dangerous' domestic violence offenders when he was jailed three years ago.

As he was led down into the cells, the former boxer and scaffolder told his victims he would 'hunt them down and kill them'.

Hull Crown Court heard Savage repeatedly beat his girlfriends and raped three other victims over a nine-year period.

The control freak dated several women at once.

He stabbed one of his girlfriends and made her clean up her own blood, telling her he would kill her if she did not.

The court heard he poured  boiling water over another when she was six months' pregnant with his child, scarring her for life.

Two weeks before she gave birth, Savage attacked her again, stamping on her face when she told him she was leaving him.

He was convicted of three counts of 
rape, three counts of causing grievous bodily harm to two of his 
victims, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and 
indecent assault.

Shipman will be sentenced next month.
