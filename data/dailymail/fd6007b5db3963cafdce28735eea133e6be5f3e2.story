A British university is to abandon experiments on baboons in Africa after an undercover investigation exposed ‘terrible suffering and cruelty’.

Harrowing pictures revealed by the Mail showed the intelligent and sociable monkeys peering out of their bare wire cages, babies clinging to each other for comfort and adults having pieces of their brain removed on the operating table. 

One particularly distressing image showed a newly-caught baby baboon suckling its mother as she was given an identification tattoo at the primate research centre in Kenya.

Experiments on baboons and other primates caught in the wild are banned in the UK due to concerns about the suffering involved in trapping and transporting them. 

But an investigation British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection revealed that Newcastle University scientists were flying thousands of miles to Kenya to do work on baboons captured on the African plains. 

The lead researcher, Professor Stuart Baker, made an impassioned defence of his quest to find vital new treatments for stroke patients. 

He also denied bypassing British law, saying the welfare concerns behind the ban did not apply to his work in Africa because the baboons are not endangered, are caught humanely and are only transported a short distance. 

Newcastle University has announced it is to pull the research in Kenya almost three weeks after the images came to light

He said that one of his reasons for going
 to the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi was to improve animal 
welfare standards and conditions had improved greatly during his time 
there. 

The use of bare, single cages is being phased out and large split-level compounds with tree ‘climbing frames’ are being built. 

But now, almost three weeks after the images came to light, the university has announced it is to pull the research in Kenya.

Joanna Lumley was one of 22,000 people to sign a petition against the experiments

All other overseas projects will be reviewed.

It is unclear what the U-turn will mean for the Professor Baker’s work on stroke. 

Professor Chris Brink, the vice-chancellor, said the baboon project began before the latest guidelines on overseas animal research were published.

He added that Newcastle University is ‘committed to excellent standards of animal welfare’ and to reducing the use of animals in research. 

The climbdown follows growing public support of the BUAV’s campaign for the taxpayer-funded experiments to be scrapped.

Two petitions attracted more than 22,000 experiments, Parliamentary questions were tabled and celebrities including actress Joanna Lumley, comedian Ricky Gervais and wildlife presenter Chris Packham joined the call for the work to be stopped. 

The BUAV said that concern from other Newcastle University researchers may also have played a role in the project being pulled. 

Sarah Kite, the charity’s director of special projects, said: ‘We welcome this move by Newcastle University to stop this controversial research in Kenya.   

‘The BUAV investigation has caused a public outcry; people have been shocked and repulsed by our findings and it is only right that the University should respond in this way.

  ‘It makes a mockery of UK law if researchers can use public funds to go overseas to carry out horrific research on wild-caught primates that would not be allowed in the UK.’
