Despite attempts from the Government to crack down on the industry, street monkey shows remain a popular form of entertainment in Indonesia.

The performances- known locally as 'topeng monyet'- involve the monkeys wearing little jumpsuits and mimicking human activities like riding bicycles or walking on stilts.

Animal rights groups have long campaigned for a ban on the shows, which they claim are cruel and exploitative.

The shows are also believed to be a health risk as the monkeys have been known to carry diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis and the bacterial disease, leptospirosis.

The performances involve macaques being dressed in human attire and imitating human activities activities like riding motorbikes

The governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, ordered all roadside monkey performances in Jakarta to be banned in Jakarta last year, but they remain popular in other parts of the country

The governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, ordered all roadside monkey performances in Jakarta to be banned last year.

The city government announced it would buy back all monkeys used as street buskers for  $90AUD and shelter them at a preserve at Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo. 

They also arranged for caretakers of the monkeys to be provided vocational training to help find new jobs.

Outside of Jakarta, the performances remain a popular activity, and for some, even a means of livelihood.

Yuli Seperi is photographer based in Bintan, Riau, Suamtera, Indonesia. He documents local street monkey performances. 

'Performing monkeys on the streets has been a regular in various regions of Indonesia. It's entertaining for the audience,' he said.

Seperi said he sympathises with the animal rights groups who campaign against the shows.

'Performing like this does seem cruel and exploitative. But I think some people have grown to rely on the shows to earn their living expenses. These are people who have little means of earning an income.'

Yelki said performing monkeys can generate Rp 50,000 or US $5AUD each performance. 

With about six performances being standard in a day, one monkey can earn around $30AUD a day.

He said he was not aware of the health risks associated with the shows.

'In my opinion, this show will not cause illness to the audience. I have never heard about this.'

Jakarta Animal Aid Network said Indonesian animal rights groups are striving for a national ban on the shows

Femke den Haas is the founder of the Jakarta Animal Aid Network.

She told Daily Mail 'The training conditions are very long and extremely painful for the monkeys; they are starved, hang upside down, arms tied,' she said.

'There "monkey villages' are suburbs where they used to keep tens of monkeys inside dark boxes, chained.

'The monkeys were owned by one boss who would rent them out to people having to pay him for using the monkeys. All monkeys in these 'monkey villages' in jakarta have been confiscated.

'While they have only been banned in Jakarta so far, we strive for an international ban on these shows.'
