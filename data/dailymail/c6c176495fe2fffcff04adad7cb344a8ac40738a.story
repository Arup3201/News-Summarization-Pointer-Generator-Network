With tears in his eyes as he holds roses in his left hand, Petro Mischtschuk poignantly stands on the grounds of a Second World War concentration camp where more than 50,000 people lost their lives.

The 87-year-old Ukrainian survivor of the appalling Buchenwald yesterday laid flowers at a ceremony marking the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the camp outside Weimar, eastern Germany.

Jews, non-Jewish Poles and Slovenes, religious and political prisoners, Roma and Sinti, Jehovah's Witnesses, criminals, homosexuals, and prisoners of war died in the camp between 1937 and 1945.

Survivor: Former detainee Wiktor Karpus, from Kiev, lays down a white rose at the memorial site for the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar in central Germany yesterday

Roses laid: More than 50.000 prisoners - Jews, non-Jewish Poles and Slovenes, religious and political prisoners, Roma and Sinti, Jehovah's Witnesses, criminals, homosexuals, and prisoners of war - died there

Remembrance: A red carnation on the gate of the memorial site for Buchenwald concentration camp

Some 21,000 prisoners were freed by 
U.S. forces in April 1945 - but 28,000 were evacuated by the Germans in 
the days prior to the liberation, a third of whom died from exhaustion 
or being shot.

Around 
250,000 people from across Europe were kept in Buchenwald from when it 
opened in July 1937 until the liberation on April 11 in 1945, according 
to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

It
was one of the largest concentration camps in Germany, although women 
were not taken there until late 1943. It was surrounded by an 
electrified barbed-wire fence, watchtowers and sentries.

Most
of the early inmates were political prisoners, but following the 
Kristallnacht attacks in 1938 almost 10,000 Jews were sent to Buchenwald
and subjected to astonishingly cruel treatment.

Medical experiments were carried out on inmates from 1941 - some of which involved testing the effectiveness of vaccines and attempting to ‘cure’ homosexuality through hormonal transplants.

There were 112,000 prisoners there by February 1945 and it became an important source of forced labour for the Nazis, who opened a rail siding connected to enable the movement of war supplies.

The SS shot prisoners in the stables and hanged others in the crematorium. Shocking scenes were witnessed by U.S. forces when they entered the camp in April, finding starving survivors and corpses.

It is thought the SS killed at least 56,000 male prisoners at Buchenwald, 11,000 of whom were Jews.
