A Death Row prisoner's choice of final meal can show how guilty or innocent they feel, a study has shown.

Researchers in the United States found that those who believe they have been 'hard done by' eat less food, or even avoid the meal altogether.

Those who have accepted guilt, meanwhile, ask for a third more calories in their meal on average.

Researchers have found that a Death Row prisoner's choice of last meal could indicate how guilty they feel

The researchers proved their hypothesis – that those who felt innocent would eat less – correct after analysing the final meals of 247 prisoners between 2002 and 2006.

They found that those who denied guilt were 2.7 times more likely to decline a meal than those who had admitted their crimes.

They also showed that prisoners who had accepted guilt, either by apologising or confessing, asked for 34 per cent more calories of food – and were more likely to request a brand name or comfort foods.

While there are many factors that could contribute to prisoners' choices, it is thought that the final meals could tell researchers something about the degree of guilt, and could also be applied to anti-obesity research.

Kevin Kniffin, of Cornell University, said: ‘The growing macabre fascination with "last meals" offers a window into one's true consumption desires when one's value of the future is discounted close to zero.

‘But in contrast to popular anecdotes and individual case studies, we created an empirical catalog of actual last meals - the final food requests of 247 individuals executed in the United States during a recent five-year period.'

He added: ‘Our content analyses reveal three key findings: [Firstly], the average last meal is calorically rich (2756 calories) and proportionally averages 2.5 times the daily recommended servings of protein and fat.

‘[Secondly], the most frequent requests are also calorie dense: meat (83.9 per cent), fried food (67.9 per cent), desserts (66.3 per cent), and soft drinks (60 per cent), and [thirdly] 39.9% requested branded foods or beverages.

‘Given that some people who are warned about the ill effects of obesity might counter-intuitively engage in unhealthy overconsumption, the findings also suggest further study relating to the artificial use of mortality salience in campaigns against obesity.’

Final meal requests in Florida range from salami sandwiches to Jack Daniel's whiskey

A Death Row prisoner's choice of last meal fascinates like few other requests and has been the subject of a number of research projects in recent years.

Last year, artist Julie Green completed a 13-year project painting more than 500 Death Row final meals on to plates.

They included everything from cigarettes to pizza and tubs of ice cream. The most commonly ordered meals were fast food from KFC and McDonald’s.

Meanwhile, in October, the Orlando Sentinel explored the final meal choices of the Death Row inmates of Florida.

Before Panhandle Killer Arthur Rutherford was put to death in 2006, he requested some foods true to his southern locale. A deep fried feast of fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection. Rutherford washed it down with sweet tea.

Clarence Hill, an attempted bank robber and police officer killer, asked for tacos. So did Angel Nieves Diaz, who murdered the owner of a Miami strip club while he and accomplices robbed it.

Oba Chandler, who raped and murdered an Ohio woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989, asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

John Spenkelink got a special treat at his 1979 execution. Not only was he the first in Florida to be put to death following the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the death penalty, but he also got to split a flask of Jack Daniel's whiskey with the prison superintendent.

Aileen Wuornos’ seven-man killing spree was immortalised in the 2003 film Monster, but her life came to an end the year before. She declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death.

Taking the opposite route was Allen Lee Davis, who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters. He chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer.
