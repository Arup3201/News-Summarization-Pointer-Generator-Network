More than 80 residents of a Cambodian village have tested positive for HIV/Aids in an outbreak thought to have been caused by contaminated needles, it was revealed last night.

Hundreds of panicked residents in the Sangkae area of Battambang province in the country's west have flocked to a health centre for testing since news of the mass infection emerged last week.

Some 72 - including 14 children – of the 556 people tested had results that were positive for HIV/Aids. The total number of people infected in the village of Roka now stands at 82.

Teng Kunthy, secretary general of the National Aids Authority based in Phnom Penh, told Agence France-Presse: ‘Of 556 people tested, 72 of them came back positive for HIV/AIDS.

‘This is a higher rate than usual... It may be caused by the use of the same tools such as needles. This is our preliminary conclusion... we are working to collect more evidence.’

A further ten people were found to be infected with the virus yesterday when more villagers arrived at the health centre, also in Battambang, it was reported.

Hei Sik, a local HIV/Aids programme director, told AFP: ‘According to villagers, they suspected the infection may have been caused by injections from private local medics.

‘This is a surprisingly high rate, the highest that I have ever seen. Some of them are women aged in their seventies and eighties.’

Cambodia has been widely hailed for its efforts in tackling HIV/AIDS, although there are estimated to be more than 73,000 people living with the disease in the country.

The National Aids Authority says the rate of HIV infection among people aged 15 to 49 in Cambodia has declined from 0.6 per cent in 2013 to 0.4 per cent in 2014.

HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It attacks the immune system and weakens the ability to fight infections and disease.

It is most commonly caught through unprotected sex, but can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment.

Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the final stage of HIV, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections.
