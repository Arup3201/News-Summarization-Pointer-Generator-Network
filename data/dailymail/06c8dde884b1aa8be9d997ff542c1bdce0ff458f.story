This year is set to see a battle between two of the biggest entertainment behemoths in history as shoot 'em ups Call of Duty and Halo release sequels within a week of one another this November.

The last Call of Duty grossed $1 billion faster than any entertainment 
product in history, beating James Cameron's Avatar to the record by 24 hours.

Halo 3 was the biggest entertainment launch of all time when it launched in 2007. The series has sold 40 million so far.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 has a 'near future' sci fi setting where an army of 'drones' has been turned against the West

Halo 4: The relaunch of the Halo franchise will be done by a new studio, 343 studios, but will feature the same robot-suited hero, Master Chief

Call of Duty: Black Ops abandons the realistic historical settings of previous Call of Duty games for a new near-future plot

Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 also features a massively enhanced graphics engine - and more multiplayer modes. The developers also promise more zombies

Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will release on November 13 - just seven days after Halo 4.

Analysts and critics are divided over which way the battle will swing. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is a radical departure for the series - abandoning the gritty realism and historical settings for a near-future look.

Gamers have had mixed feelings about the first trailer - but many hope that it could rejuvenate the franchise.

Although Modern Warfare 3 was commercially successful, it was less well received by critics - who claimed the franchise was becoming tired.

'Black Ops 2, thankfully, shows a way forward for the Call of Duty brand as it appears to be something genuinely new,' says Pat Garratt, editor of game news site VG247.

'There was talk about stagnation after Modern Warfare 3, largely because it was assumed the next game would be entirely predictable. That Activision has surprised everyone by moving into true sci-fi territory is fantastic news for both fans and the games business in general.'

The new Call of Duty features a sci-fi setting far more similar to the Halo games - which also revolved around an attack on cities on Earth

'Hands down, this is the most ambitious Call of Duty ever,' said Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing. 'We are bringing disruptive innovation to the franchise and we are doing it on several fronts. We're pushing the boundaries technologically, graphically, and from a narrative and gameplay perspective.'

Gamers will also be reassured to know that there will be more zombies than ever before

Mark Lamia, Studio Head for Treyarch, said, 'Running in the multiplayer engine for the first time, Zombies gives players a bigger and more diverse set of gameplay experiences, as well as entirely new ways to wage war with the undead.'
