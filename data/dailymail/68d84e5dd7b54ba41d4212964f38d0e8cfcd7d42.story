A coalition row over the tax rate for high earners erupted today as Lib Dem Danny Alexander insisting it will be cut to 40p ‘over my dead body’.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election.

But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson said the current 45p rate was not reasonable, and warned the Lib Dems about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘the dead body of Danny Alexander’.

The future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £150,000 has become a major political battleground.

In the last weeks of the Labour government then-Chancellor Alistair Darling increased it from 40p to 50p.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne then cut it to 45p in 2012, claiming the measure had raised ‘next to nothing’ for the Treasury.

Ed Balls has vowed to return it to 50p if Labour wins the next election, but Tories are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p.

However Mr Alexander, the second most senior Lib Dem in the government, refused to yield to the Conservative demands.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said the Lib Dems should not make hollow threats that they cannot keep

‘I think it is right at 45 per cent. I wouldn't go to cutting below 45 per cent,’ he told the Daily Mirror.

‘I would say that would happen over my dead body.’

At Prime Minister’s Questions last week David Cameron refused to rule out a further cut, insisting only that his priority for expensive tax cuts were those on low and middle incomes.

Asked about the Tories’ ambiguity, Mr Alexander said: ‘You'll have to ask them why they answer those questions in those ways.

‘If you ask me would I cut the top rate below 45p the answer is “no”. In this Parliament we will not allow that to happen.’

However, the Conservatives have refused to rule out promising a further cut, believing it will help to attract investors and entrepreneurs to the UK.

Mr Johnson warned the Lib Dems against threats about blocking a cut which might be difficult tostand by.

‘The last thing I want to see is pointless sacrifice from the Liberal Democrats, let alone the dead body of Danny Alexander,’ the London mayor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘Who can say what will happen to Danny Alexander? Stranger things have happened at sea.

‘I don’t think it is reasonable always to keep UK tax rates higher than those of competitor countries.

‘UK income tax is now higher than the average in the EU; that never used to be the case, I don’t see why that should be the case for the long term and I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t bring it down.’

He said he could not ‘believe’ that the Tories will go into the next election in 2015 promising to keep tax rates higher than other countries.

However Labour attacked Mr Alexander for supporting the cut from 50p to 45p.

Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Danny Alexander seems to have forgotten that just 10 months ago he cut the top rate of tax for the top 1 per cent of earners.

'And that was after saying anybody who wanted to do this was living in "cloud cuckoo land".

'Labour will reverse this tax cut for millionaires as we balance the books in the next Parliament in a fairer way. It tells you everything you need to know about David Cameron and George Osborne that they haven't ruled out cutting the top rate of tax again.'
