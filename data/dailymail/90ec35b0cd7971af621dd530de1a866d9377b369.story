An Indiana man has miraculously survived being struck by an Amtrak train going at 110 miles per hour with just scratches and fractured bones.

Darryle Jacob See, 22, was walking in Michiana along the U.S. 12 east of Michigan City on Friday when the accident occurred.

See, who was able to sit up and speak to police following the accident, says he doesn't recall the accident.

Survivor: Darryle See's survival after being hit by a train is being hailed as nothing short of a miracle

Traveling at speed: The Chicago-bound Amtrak train was traveling at 110 miles per hour when it hit Darryle See

According to See's grandmother, Helen Hugley, he left the family's Shady Oak trailer park home to go for a walk along the Michiana shoreline about 11:30am.

It appears that See, who had headphones on, walked into the middle of the train tracks and into the course of a Chicago-bound AMTRAK train traveling at 110 miles per hour.

NBC reports that  conductors sounded the horn several times before employing the emergency brakes.

But it was too late. Train officials said the train was traveling at 110 mph at the time of the accident.

Grateful: See's grandmother Helen Hugley is ecstatic that her grandson survived the horrific accident with minor injuries

Impact: See was wearing just a t-shirt, shorts and sneakers, one of which fell off when he was hit by the train

See was struck by the train and the impact sent him flying 20 feet onto the other side of the tracks.

Police and ambulance workers who arrived on the scene said See was alert and talking to police following the terrifying impact.

LaPorte County Police Major John Boyd told NBC he's amazed anyone could survive being hit by a train traveling at such speeds.

'The conductor said it was a straight-on hit,' Boyd said.

'It was absolutely amazing,' he said of See's survival. 'I’ve seen a number of people get hit by trains and it’s never a good thing.'

Nightmare: To the horror of conductors, See didn't move off the tracks after they sounded the train's horn

Hugley said See underwent surgery today at Memorial Hospital in South Bend hospital to repair cracked vertebrae. He reportedly has 'one or two' fractures to his pelvis.

Boyd told NWI that the angled front of the locomotive could have deflected some of the force of the impact.

'He says he doesn't remember anything until he woke up on the other side of the tracks,' said Hugley

'I would definitely call it a miracle. I couldn’t believe it when they told us he was alive and talking,' she told NBC.

Following his successful neck surgery today, See is expected to make a full recovery.
