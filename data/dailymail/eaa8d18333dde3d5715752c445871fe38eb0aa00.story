Globe-trotting Oscar the dog has flown over the Grand Canyon in a helicopter and crossed the Golden Gate bridge in the latest stage of his world tour.

After visiting more than 30 countries and stopping at iconic landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China during his great journey three years ago, the plucky pup was ready to take to the skies again.

Oscar, who travels with his owner Joanne Lefson, has now braved a hot air balloon flight, helicopter ride and more plane trips as he ticks more destinations off his list, including Germany, Brussels and the Netherlands.

Ms Lefson, who is half-British, rescued Oscar from a South African kennel eight years ago - just a day before he was due to be put down.

The
pair began their epic journey across five continents in 2009 in a bid 
to help millions of dogs without a home, visiting more than 20,000 dog 
shelters on the way.

The
ten-year-old canine has also recently revisited some of his favourite 
spots including Nevada, France and India, meaning he has now travelled 
more than 150,000 kilometres - twice the circumference of the earth.

Ms Lefson,
who uses money made from the sale of her home to fund trips, said she 
would not stop travelling and raising awareness until every dog had a 
home.

She said: 'Travel remains in our 
bloodstream as does the case for dog adoption. An estimated half a 
billion dogs on the planet are homeless.

'When they're adopted, we'll unbuckle our seat belts and put our paws up.

'Oscar
loved the helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon he seemed a little 
disappointed there weren't any crocs in the Canyon but anxiously watched
at every turn for the odd animal to visually chase.

'During
the balloon ride he barked his brains out. There must be something 
about all that fire in the sky that makes him barking mad.

Kennel kid: If Ms Lefson had not adopted Oscar from the shelter, he might not have had a loving owner - or the chance to visit so many far-flung spots

'Perhaps his most impressive achievement is that he has endured several flights lasting 16 hours and more and hasn't even lifted a leg.

'It's a miracle he's still even alive though. If I hadn't gone to the kennel that fateful day Oscar would have had one more day left and would have been put down.

'When I discovered what a wonderful dog Oscar was it broke my heart to think how many Oscars are still out there and simply just don't get that second chance.

'I want to change perceptions of shelter dogs being old, abused and disturbed animals. Nothing could be further from the truth.'
