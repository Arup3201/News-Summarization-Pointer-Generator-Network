A brave bridegroom who danced for the first time on his wedding night despite losing both his legs has won a starring part on Strictly Come Dancing.

Nathan Stephens, 25, amazed show organisers with his YouTube dance on his wedding night after losing both legs in a train accident when he was just nine.

And now they have given him a starring role with professional Iveta Lukosiute in a Strictly special to be shown on the BBC for Sport Relief.

Paralympian Nathan Stephens, 25 who learned to dance for his wedding to Charlene Beard has won a starring role in Sports Relief's 'Strictly Come Dancing'

Nathan stunned his wedding guests last year by dancing for the first time, with his new bride, Charlene Beard

Nathan said: 'I was nervous saying yes to Strictly because just three minutes dancing at the wedding left me in excruciating pain.

'But it is all for such a good cause.

'We never even asked anyone to film our wedding video and now the world has seen it and I’m dancing on TV!'

Nathan made headlines last year after promising bride Charlene Beard, 26, they would have the traditional first dance together at their wedding reception.

Paralympic athlete Nathan and his bride Charlene secretly practised their dance routine for eight months in their living room.

Only Charlene was in on the surprise when Nathan wheeled himself out of the reception - and went to a cupboard where a pair of prosthetic legs had been hidden away from guests.

Moments later there were gaps of astonishment then cheers and applause as Nathan and Charlene took to the floor

And there wasn’t a dry eye in the house as the pair didn’t put a foot wrong during their three-minute routine - described as good enough for Strictly Come Dancing.

Now the javelin thrower will star in the real thing after his wedding video went viral and made headlines around the world.

Nathan had owned a pair of prosthetic legs for years before dancing at his wedding but never wore them as they caused him agony.

He has prepared for the gruelling dance training by visiting a prosthetic engineer who padded his prosthetic legs with silicone and attached straps to stop them rubbing.

He and the other four other Paralympians then spent a week practicing their Salsa routines in the studio for seven hours every day.

Nathan, who is partnered with Strictly professional Iveta Lukosiute, said: 'My right leg took a bit of battering because it was holding my weight.

'On my crutches, all the weight is on my shoulders so I wasn’t used to it.

Nathan, pictured fishing as a boy, says he is planning to keep up the dance lessons now Strictly is over

'After the first night, I got back to the hotel and took off my legs and I had a huge blister.

'But my left leg was fine and it was worth the pain!

'Put four athletes in a room together and they’re going to want to beat each other.'

Nathan, who is originally from Kenfig Hill near Bridgend, is planning to keep up the dance lessons.

Paralympian Nathan, who is now focused on training for the Rio Paralympics in 2016, wore specially adapted prosthetics for his appearance in Strictly

He said: 'Halfway through the week, I said I was going to throw my legs on a bonfire but I stuck with it and I’m so glad I did.

'It got quite emotional for all of us, and I think we all realised just how much more we can do if we push ourselves.

'I’m going to start doing more things on two legs now.

'I now know I can break down mental barriers and I have a new mentality and outlook on life.'

Nathan is now preparing to dedicate his time to training for the Rio Paralympics in 2016.

He will be dancing on Strictly for Sport Relief on March 21 on BBC One.
