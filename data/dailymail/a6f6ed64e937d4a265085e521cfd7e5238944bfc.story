Gender divide: TV presenter Prof Alice Roberts argues pink Lego reinforces sexists attitudes which see boys perform better at science

Pink Lego for girls helps reinforce gender attitudes that see boys performing better in science, a BBC television presenter and scientist has claimed.

Professor Alice Roberts, the popular presenter on the 'Coast' series and 'Prehistoric Autopsy', hit out at the sexism that deters women from pursuing the subject.

Since girls are better represented in maths and science in most other countries around the world, the reason why they lag behind in Britain must be 'something cultural' rather than 'an innate biological thing', she told an education conference.

She said: 'The gender divide seems to be getting worse to me.

'Lego has always been a good toy which teaches children about engineering. But Lego is now producing a range which it is says is for girls, which is completely pink and is about creating cakes.

'I think the problem is happening at a very young age, when the idea is instilled that there is a big difference between girls and boys, rather than at age 15.'

She added: 'What I found outrageous was the suggestion that using shopping and pink to get girls interested in science would work. It goes back to a 1950s idea of what women should be like.

'The key is to make these subjects less gender specific than more so.'

She was speaking in front of teachers and school leaders at the Education Innovation event in Manchester.

Criticism: Professor Roberts has attacked Lego for making product ranges which are targeted at girls

She pointed to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which showed Britain was one of only three countries where teenage girls did worse than boys in maths and science.

The married TV scientist, who is a Professor at Birmingham University and has a young daughter, said: 'It is definitely difficult for women to progress in scientific careers.

''One of the problems is childcare. If you have a career break, it has an amazingly bad effect on people's career.

'If you look at the men and women starting science degrees at university the numbers are about equal, but when you get to professor level, only 15 per cent are women.''

Prof Roberts, 39, added: 'The fact that girls are doing better in other parts of the world, suggest it is not an innate biological thing. There must be something cultural going on.'

Prof Roberts is set to appear on screens later this year in the BBC documentary Ice Age.

Lego said its 'Friends' range was developed following requests from parents and girls for more realistic and detailed sets with brighter colours and role-playing opportunities.

A spokesman said: 'We've always had Lego bricks that are pink and we've got a wide variety of different sets.

'We don't say “this is for girls”. It's up to the child or the parent to make the choice.'
