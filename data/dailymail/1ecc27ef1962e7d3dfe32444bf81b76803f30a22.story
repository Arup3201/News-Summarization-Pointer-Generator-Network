It's the hardest part of selling a house: getting those all-important pictures right.

And this adorable 86-year-old grandmother has set the bar.

In a bid to show just how homely her Florida abode is, Yolie Ball photobombed every shot in a delightful pink t-shirt and a winning smile.

The results have made her something of an online sensation with 12,000 favorites on Twitter.

Surprise! Yolie Ball had some fun with the real estate photos for her Davenport, Florida, home

In one of the four photographs of the property in Davenport, Mrs Ball is seen peeking out from behind a door.

Another has the mother-of-three, grandmother-of-three, perched casually in a chair with a cup of tea.

For would-be buyers that like to read, Mrs Ball demonstrates that too.

And the blue and white kitchen is brought to life in the fourth photo with her cheeky grin and casual lean on the table top.

The photographs are testament to the 12 happy years she and husband Don, 82, have spent in the home, which is located in a 55+ neighborhood.

The four photos have yet to be put on the listing but became an internet sensation on Twitter

Twelve blissful years: Mr and Mrs Ball have lived in Davenport since 2003, where Mr Ball, 82, works at Epcot

Near to Disneyworld, it has been a convenient spot for Mr Ball, who has been the captain of a boat at Epcot theme park for 10 years.

Bringing his career to a close on March 31 this year, Mr Ball and his newly-famous wife, who sells home-knitted scarves, are hoping to move closer to their daughter in Tennessee.

Their 15-year-old granddaughter Makenzie Ball, who posted the pictures on Twitter, is now trending in Canada and Miami after the pictures became an instant success.

She told DailyMail.com: 'It is so cute! She did not expect this at all.

Happy: The couple have a great sense of humor, their granddaughter told DailyMail.com

Moving on: They are leaving the sunny state to be closer to family in Tennessee

Parents: They have three children and three grandchildren, who are scattered across Tennessee and Virginia

Captain Don Ball: On March 31, Mr Ball will have served 10 years as captain of a boat at Disneyworld's Epcot

'My aunt offered to take the pictures, I think they were just fooling around and then my grandma decided to get in all of them. 

'I don't think my grandparents really understand what all the Twitter lingo means but when I told them "12,000 favorites and 6,000 retweets" they just laughed really hard.

'I read my grandma, Yolie, some of the replies and it made her really happy!'

She later added: 'My grandma is actually crying!'

The home will be listed soon on American Mobile Home Sales Of Florida with the address 308 Maui Ave.
