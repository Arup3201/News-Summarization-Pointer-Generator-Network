Arrest: Verna McClain has been charged with capital murder in the killing of 28-year-old Kala Marie Golden, after she shot her and stole her baby

The nurse charged with murdering a young mother and abducting her three-day-old infant recently suffered a miscarriage and wanted to pass of the stolen baby as her own.

Verna Deann McClain, 30, told police she planned to tell her fiance that she had given birth and that little Keegan Schachardt was their child.

McClain had reportedly told relatives she wanted to adopt a baby after her miscarriage.

Authorities say McClain, a mother of three, didn't know Kayla Marie Golden, 28, but targeted her Tuesday afternoon in the parking lot of a pediatrician's office in Spring, Texas, because she was carrying a baby with her.

As Ms Golden tried to put Keegan in her pickup truck, McClain started a fight with her and then shot her several times.

Police say she grabbed the infant and put him in her blue Lexus, even as his dying mother screamed 'My baby! My baby!'

When Ms Golden tried to reach into McClain's car to take back her child, McClain hit her with the luxury sedan and then sped away,

McClain faces capital murder charges in the killing after police tracked her car to at an apartment complex about a mile from the site of the abduction.

Keegan was found safe in an adjacent county with McClain's sister, Corina Jackson.

Speaking on Good Morning America, 
district 
attorney Brett Ligon admitted it was 'unusual' to find the child and 
suspect so quickly after a murder, and credited the county's 
authorities.

Once seized, McClain admitted to 
shooting the young mother and taking the baby to her home in Harris 
County, ABC reported. She had picked Golden at random and did not know 
her.

An affidavit from the Montgomery 
County police adds that the suspect's sister, Corina Jackson, said 
McClain, whose children are 16, 10 and six, had said she was about to 
adopt a baby.

After the shooting, McClain told her sister she gave birth to the baby.

Ligon said authorities 'believe this
 was an intentional act on her part, not that Ms Golden was targeted 
specifically, but that this was part of a plan to kidnap a child'.

He added: 'She's
 given a full statement to the 
detectives with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department. We did 
charge her in the early hours of this morning with capital murder.'

Search: Officers enter an apartment where they found a woman speaking to the suspect on the phone

Closing in: Officers had tracked the blue Lexus used as a getaway car back to the apartment

The suspect's estranged husband, Theo McClain from San Diego, California, said: 'I don't understand that, her taking a child. That doesn't make sense.'

The couple had two children and 
raised another from a previous relationship of his. He added: 'We have 
three kids. And then to shoot somebody? I've never known her to hurt 
anybody.'

McClain
 has no previous criminal record and has been a licensed vocational 
nurse registered in California since 2008. She is being held in the 
Montgomery County Jail without bond.

Montgomery County police said another person of interest is being questioned.

Ms Golden was walking to her pick-up truck after a check-up with little 
Keegan, when a woman in a Lexus parked in the adjacent spot starting 
fighting with her, police said.

Sheriff's Lt Dan Norris said the woman pulled out a pistol and repeatedly shot Ms Golden at close range. Witnesses reported hearing up to seven shots.

Support: The baby's father, Keith Schuchardt, is comforted by friends and family outside his home

Grief: Mr Schuchardt said how much he loved Golden and how they'd been excited about their future

A witness said a man in the car then 
picked up the infant and put him in the Lexus. Ms Golden tried to reach 
into the car and take him back as the car sped away, but the driver ran 
her down.

The shooting happened just after 2pm 
outside the Northwoods Pediatric Centre in Spring, 20 
miles north of Houston, Texas. Keegan was wearing a green-and-white outfit reading 'handsome'.

Joshua
 Jesson said he was in the clinic with his girlfriend when he heard 
gunshots.

He said he saw the Lexus next to the pick-up truck, then later 
looked back and saw the car was gone and a woman lying in the spot where
 the Lexus had been parked.

'I thought she just passed out. Then somebody ran in here and said, "Somebody got shot,"' he said.

Police surrounded the parking lot 
with crime-scene tape. The clinic is in an area thick with strip malls. 
Golden's red truck sat next to yellow markers where spent ammunition 
cartridges were found.

Caught: McClain (pictured right with her sister Yoki) has three children and is a registered nurse

Proud: Golden with Mr Schuchardt, who had announced the birth of their son on Facebook on Saturday

It was not immediately clear how 
authorities had been led to the apartment block in Houston, where officers were seen 
wielding guns and riot shields.

Ms Golden's husband, Keith Schuchardt, took to Facebook on Saturday to report
 the birth of his son: 'baby keegan is here. born 4/14/12 6 lbs 15 oz, 
20 inches long.' he wrote. 'Looks like me lol.'

He arrived with Keegan's grandmother 
Linda Golden and other family members at Conroe Police Department last 
night to be reunited with the infant.

But the Houston Chronicle reports that police want to carry out a series of investigations on family members before he is released.

Linda
 Golden said: 'My daughter was brutally murdered protecting her baby. I 
think the baby should be given back to us. We've had enough today. We 
would just like our baby back.'

She added of her daughter: 'She died trying to save her baby.'

Friends and relatives have expressed their shock at the senseless crime. Friend Jennifer Hartis told KPRC: 'She never did anything wrong. She's just a mom doing her best to take care of her kids.

'Keegan is only three days old. He's needs to know his mom and he can't do that now.'

Henry Schuchardt, Keegan's paternal father, told the affiliate he was searching for answers. 'I wished I knew, I wished I knew,' he said. 'I don't know how they could do this?'

The baby's father Keith Schuchardt added to KHOU on Tuesday: 'She was sweet, lovable. I loved her, and she loved me. Everything was going fine until today.'

When asked by reporters what he would tell his wife now, Schuchardt, who had been married to Golden for three years, said: I wish you were here with me to get me through this.'
