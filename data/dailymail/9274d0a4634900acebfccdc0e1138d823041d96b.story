Rhys Webb intends to 'give it my best shot' in the battle for Wales scrum-half starting duty against Australia next month.

Ospreys half-back Webb is viewed in many quarters as favourite to wear the number nine shirt ahead of 87 times-capped British and Irish Lion Mike Phillips.

While Phillips has had to content himself with a regular bench role for French club Racing Metro this season, Webb has been at the hub of Ospreys' impressive Guinness PRO12 form.

The league leaders have been guided superbly by Webb and fly-half Dan Biggar, suggesting they could take their domestic partnership into the Test match arena on November 8.

'He (Phillips) is obviously a world-class nine,' Webb, 25, said.

'He has had so many caps for Wales, he is a British Lion, so he is number one.

'I am happy enough enough to come in, give it my best shot and leave it up to the coaches then.

'There is plenty to work on. I know I have to pick my game up nother notch.

'I am just looking forward to getting down to the hard work on the training pitch with the squad.

'It is nice to be fully fit for a change! I've had a good run of games and got my confidence up. I am just really enjoying my rugby at the moment.'

Webb, who has won six caps, gained Wales coach Warren Gatland's vote for two games in last season's RBS 6 Nations Championship, starting against France and England before suffering an injury at Twickenham.

But he now appears on course to reclaim a shirt that Phillips has largely made his own, particularly during Gatland's coaching reign that began more than six years ago.

'I am really enjoying it,' said Webb, of his prolific partnership with Biggar. 'It's good to have someone like Dan outside me.

'We've known each other for a long time now, and we know each other inside and out. Playing together week in, week out is obviously good for the (Ospreys) squad and the team.

'I know when he wants the ball and when he wants to kick, and I know when to take the pressure off him if I can see there is too much pressure on him.

'I think with the Ospreys this season I have taken that ownership and taken the pressure off him a bit.

'There is a sense of excitement in the Wales camp.

'The World Cup is a long way off, but it all starts against Australia next week, so hopefully we can have a good training week leading up to that.

'I think a lot of the boys will be frustrated with the South Africa game just gone (Wales lost 31-30 in Nelspruit in June), and really have a point to prove as well.'
