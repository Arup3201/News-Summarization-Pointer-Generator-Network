Luis Suarez is being protected by armed soldiers at the Uruguay team hotel after he controversially bit Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday.

Security around the striker has been stepped up, with military police surrounding the Serhs Hotel in Natal where the Uruguay team are staying.

Truckloads of soldiers sat outside the hotel, while more armed guards patrolled the area as pressure grows on FIFA to ban the controversial forward.

Uruguay qualified from Group D thanks to a Diego Godin goal, but the result was overshadowed by Suarez's bite on Chiellini.

FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings against the Liverpool striker, and given Uruguay until 9pm on Wednesday to respond.

If Suarez is found guilty he could be banned for up to two years, although the longest ban in World Cup history is eight games.

Suarez was banned for seven games for biting Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 2010, and received a further 10-game ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013.

Uruguay are due to fly back to their Sao Paolo base on Wednesday before traveling to Rio to face Colombia in the last 16 next Monday.
