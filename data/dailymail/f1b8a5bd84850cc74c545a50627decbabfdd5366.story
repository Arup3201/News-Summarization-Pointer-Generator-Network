Many of us have taken a tumble after drinking one too many but its likely these revellers were left with a more sore head than most.

From an 'endless' fall down an escalator at Leeds to a man tumbling onto the tracks when he tried to kick a pigeon in Edinburgh, Network Rail has released CCTV of some of the most dangerous antics across its stations.

In one terrifying clip, a drunken passenger can be seen leaning against a moving train as it pulls into Manchester Piccadilly Station before falling underneath a carriage on to the rails.

The man luckily missed the train wheels and survived the fall.

See the CCTV below...

Ongoing fall: A male passenger can be seen repeatedly rolling down an escalator, which is travelling upwards, in Leeds as a woman tries to walk down to reach him

Help at hand: Apparently completely unable to pick himself up, a crowd gathers at the bottom of the escalator at Leeds station to help him up

Network Rail (NR) has released the shocking footage as part of a new safety campaign to make passengers aware of the dangers of travelling after a heavy night of drinking.

It comes after more than 1,600 people have been hurt in slips, trips and falls at the 17 stations run by NR in the last year - with many of the incidents occurring after bouts of evening drinking.Â 

Falls by passengers have been most prevalent at Leeds station and at the London stations of Paddington and Liverpool Street.

Incidents in the last year have included one death, 51 bone fractures, 19 dislocations, five concussions and dozens of bruises, cuts and abrasions as people have fallen on steps and escalators, over luggage and even off platforms between trains.

Run up: A young man wearing a kilt can be seen running towards a pigeon as he prepares to kick it at Edinburgh Waverley station shortly after 10pm

Dangerous: But the pigeon flies away at the last moment - leaving the man teetering on the edge of the platform

On the rails: The man loses his balance and plunges on to the platform behind a stationary train. His friend decides to leave him and nonchalantly walks off

NR's network operations managing director Robin Gisby said: 'We do everything we can to make moving around our stations as easy and safe as possible but our teams deal with far too many people who have injured themselves where it appears alcohol has been a factor.'

British Transport Police Deputy Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: 'Somewhat inevitably, drinking alcohol can impair people's judgment and co-ordination.

'Encouraging passengers to be more aware of their surroundings, particularly when they have had a drink, and to be alert to the inherent dangers that exist in stations will, we hope, reduce avoidable slips and falls across the network.'

The safety campaign includes posters at the 17 stations and a video placed on YouTube and on screen in stations.

Wobbly: A young man unsteady on his feet in the background starts to lean against a moving train as it comes in to a platform at Manchester Piccadilly Station

Terrifying: The man in the background then stumbles - falling underneath the moving train

Lucky: The man completely disappears from view underneath the train which quickly comes to a halt. Incredibly, the mam survived the fall
