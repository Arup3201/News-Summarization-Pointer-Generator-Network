Marussia sporting director Graeme Lowdon is adamant the team has the funds to see out the season and are doing all they can to ensure they will be on the grid in 2015.

Speculation emerged over the course of the Singapore Grand Prix that due to financial difficulties the Banbury-based marque almost failed to make it onto the grid at the previous race in Italy.

That is a rumour Lowdon vehemently denies, and whilst conceding times are hard, they are nowhere near as black a picture as being painted by some.

Speaking to Press Association Sport, Lowdon said: 'We have an obligation to trade correctly, and if you don't reasonably believe you can do that, you have to stop. As simple as that.

'Is it plain sailing, navigating a company through an industry that has the cost structure of Formula One? No.

'But if we didn't think we could be here, then we wouldn't be here.

'You don't want to give the wrong impression by glibly saying "yes, we're fine" because it's always a challenge operating businesses in this environment.

'I can say that, yes, we have the funds for this season. If we didn't, we shouldn't be here.'

Marussia have been linked to Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian fashion industry billionaire who is understood to have spoken with Sauber with regard to investment, only for talks to falter.

Lowdon declined to comment on Stroll, although at present it is understood no discussions have yet taken place with the team's majority shareholder Andrey Cheglakov.

As for 2015, and with gossip rife F1 could be reduced to eight teams fielding three cars as three teams face going to the wall over the winter, Lowdon maintains Marussia are working tooth and nail to be on the grid for the opening race in Melbourne in March.

'Nobody can state unequivocally they will be racing next season. Not a single person in this pit lane can do that,' said Lowdon.

'Look at Honda, Toyota and BMW who all pulled out at the drop of a hat. They were companies who had finances to be in this sport, but chose not to.

'If it makes sense then people will be there, as simple as that.

'The people involved in Formula One are not crazy. We see long-term value in what we are trying to do, what we are trying to build.

'Obviously there are plenty of easier things in the world to do, and there are certainly easier ways to make money, that's absolutely for sure.

'But we believe in the long-term value of Formula One. We've said this a number of times, the biggest asset Formula One has to be its fanbase.

'It's enormous, unique, and is incredibly valuable, so that itself is sufficient for a team like us to build for the long term.

'But that also means there can be difficult times along the way.'

Lowdon can at least confirm Marussia are currently in the process of building their car for 2015, claiming it is 'moving along at speed'.

Lowdon added: 'We're quite happy with the progress we're seeing.

'We're doing what any team could, would, should be doing at this stage. We're no different.

'The bottom line is: times are tough, but we're still here, still on the grid, still fighting, and at this stage we're doing everything to be on the grid in 2015.'
