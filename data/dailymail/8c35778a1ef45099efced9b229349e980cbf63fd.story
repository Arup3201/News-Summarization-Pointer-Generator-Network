Claim: Nigel Farage has been paid more than £60,000 in expenses for his constituency office

Nigel Farage was facing a probe into the UK Independence Party’s finances last night as the Electoral Commission announced that he has ‘questions to answer’ over the use of his British office.

Ukip supporters John and Julia Longhurst gave a building in West Sussex called ‘The Old Grain Store’ to Mr Farage rent-free 15 years ago.

But the only time the Euro MP has listed the donation was in June 2004 when a £1,100 donation was filed with the election watchdog as ‘non cash-premises’.

The Electoral Commission announced that it is writing to Mr Farage to ask him to explain why he did not register the office as a benefit in kind every year.

The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 clearly states that ‘the provision otherwise than on commercial terms of any property, services or facilities for the use or benefit of the party’ counts as a donation.

A spokesman for the Electoral Commission: ‘There are a lot of questions around this. We’re getting in touch with the party to seek clarification.

‘We would like more information because Mr Farage is a regulated donee and so is his constituency party. We need to see whether donations in kind were registered in the right way.’

Mr Farage also faced charges of hypocrisy yesterday as it emerged that he has claimed ‘general expenditure allowances’ from the European Parliament averaging £15,000 a year to pay for the same office – while denouncing EU largesse and MPs who abuse Westminster expenses.

While Mr Farage is not required by the EU to justify where the money has gone, he has voluntarily declared how much money has been spent on the office since 2009 – a sum totalling nearly £70,000.

Mr Farage said: ‘I’m not defending this system, I want it to end. But I get given, as does every other British MEP, £3,580 every month to spend in the UK and in my constituency as I see fit.

'We do not have to provide any receipts or any explanation for how that money is spent.’ 

Asked where the money goes, he said: ‘The electricity bill is more than £3,000 a year.’

Nigel Farage has previously boasted over the vast amounts of expenses he is able to claim from the European Parliament.

In 2009, after a decade as an MEP, he estimated that he had claimed £2million in expenses - a figure which would now stand at £3million if it continued at the same rate.  

He has come under fire for employing his wife Kirsten as a secretary, using £20,000 a year in public funds.  

And this month it emerged that he uses a private company to funnel the money he is paid for media appearances, which could halve his tax bill.  

Mr Farage has always defended his use of expenses, saying that he spends everything he claims on UKIP's campaign to pull Britain out of the EU.

The
 Ukip leader lost his temper when asked to explain why the cost was so 
high for a small office measuring just 625 sq ft. The average dual fuel 
bill for a 1,000 sq ft home is just £1,200.

Questioned
 on Sky News whether he was running in his office ‘a sauna’ or ‘Tracey 
Island’ – the headquarters in the TV children’s series Thunderbirds – Mr
 Farage attacked the interviewer Dermot Murngahan as an ‘establishment’ 
stooge and added: ‘We are  running machines, running banks of computers,
 running photocopiers.’

However
 a former member of Ukip has asked the European Parliament’s anti-fraud 
office OLAF to investigate Mr Farage’s use of allowances.

An
 OLAF spokesman said it had received a complaint, was considering 
whether it fell within its remit and whether there was sufficient 
evidence to launch an investigation.

One
 former Ukip member claimed last night that whistleblowers were 
silenced, ignored or forced out of the party after daring to question 
its use of EU allowances and donations.

He
 told The Times that Mr Farage had called a senior female official a 
‘stupid woman’ and told her to ‘shut up’ when she asked for an 
independent audit into party finances.

Another member was allegedly physically threatened.

A
 spokesman for the party said: ‘These historic allegations come from a 
few very unimpressive people that Ukip attracted years ago and who were 
gradually weeded out.’

Mr 
Farage could also be in hot water with Brussels officials after 
admitting in a television interview yesterday that he uses allowances to
 travel around the UK campaigning.

His
 robust defence of his use of allowances provoked fury from the Tories, 
who pointed out he has called for MPs who abused the Westminster 
expenses system to be jailed.

A
 senior Tory said: ‘That is the hypocrisy of the man. He says he hates 
the Brussels gravy train and then he boasts that he is riding it all the
 way.’
