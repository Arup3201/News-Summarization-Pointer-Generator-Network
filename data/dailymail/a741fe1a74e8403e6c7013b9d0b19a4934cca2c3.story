When my boyfriend shook me awake in the middle of the night, shouting inches from my face, it took me several minutes to work out why he was so livid.

Apparently, I had been making little noises in my sleep, and doing so deliberately just to annoy him.

Toxic relationship: Melissa Kite was emotionally abused by her ex-boyfriend for three years

It was something of a change to his behaviour earlier that evening, when he’d refused to speak so much as a word to me. I had no idea why, but then, there was often no perceptible trigger behind his terrifying mood swings.

Although there was always just one person at fault: me.

Often it would be just the way I looked at him. This could lead to being pushed into a chair and drilled, finger-wagging, for hours about my disrespect. Sometimes it was the things that I said which were ‘wrong’, leading him to explode with devastating insults.

This behaviour, which lasted throughout our three-year relationship, wasn’t just cruel and demeaning. It shattered my self-esteem. It could easily have destroyed my life.

So you might expect me to welcome the proposals unveiled yesterday to make emotional abuse illegal.

Home Secretary Theresa May wants to create a specific offence of domestic abuse that will mean men can be prosecuted not just for violence against their partners, but also for any psychological torment they inflict.

But, far from being enthused by the plans, they fill me with panic.

For while I agree with campaigners that emotional cruelty can be every bit as frightening and destructive as physical attacks, I think criminalising such behaviour could have devastating consequences for all involved.

I would certainly hate for my ex-boyfriend to have been prosecuted for what he did. Not just because of the terrible toll this would have taken on him — reputational damage, job loss, distress, and the inevitable rise in his anger — but also for the way it would have changed me.

I don’t think I would have been able to recover from the justice system intervening in my personal life. In the end, I recovered from the experience because I took control and left that destructive situation myself.

I first met my former boyfriend, a high-flying City boy, through friends eight years ago, when we were both in our mid-30s. He was smart, extremely charming and I fell for him instantly.

At first he seemed the model boyfriend; even when I noticed his wardrobe held identical sets of shoes, suits and ties arranged meticulously in colour order, I just thought him well organised. I never imagined how extreme such perfectionism could become.

The truth emerged on our first holiday, just weeks into our relationship, when he whisked me off to Provence.

One evening, out of the blue, he yelled at me for getting out of the car first and told me to ‘come back here’. When I went inside he ranted that I was never to walk ahead of him again — always alongside or behind.

Of course I packed my bags, disgusted, but he begged me to forgive him — so I did. This was to set the pattern for endless similar incidents that followed.

His control over me only grew: he made me line up my shoes, checked my text messages to make sure I wasn’t having an affair, and threw me out of his house one night because my mobile rang while we were in bed.

'Non-violent crime': Theresa May wants psychological torment to be classed as a crime

The many incidents of bullying, intimidation and brainwashing are too numerous to list, but he wanted to control every aspect of my life — right down to the clothes I wore — and flew into terrifying rages whenever I went against his will. It was a living hell having to walk on eggshells all the time and the stress changed me beyond recognition.

I went from being a confident, independent, feisty woman to someone who made myself small to please him and who, yes, eventually walked meekly alongside or behind, often in flat shoes. I lost over a stone, became incredibly nervous, and isolated myself from my family and friends because I couldn’t face the shame when they told me to leave him only for me to tell them I couldn’t.

Of course, I contemplated leaving, but I was convinced I was head over heels in love and would never be able to survive without him.

I also considered calling the police on occasion — usually after a particularly long and vicious verbal attack — but felt he had done nothing criminally wrong.

He never laid a finger on me, except to manhandle me into a chair to lecture me, and he once accidentally threw a phone at my head. He’d got into such a frenzy about me putting a Britney Spears CD on that he let the phone slip as he gesticulated, although he wasn’t sorry when it hit me.

Oh, and he once put his hands around my throat and mock throttled me because, he said, he wanted to demonstrate what he would do to anyone who ever threatened us.

But on the whole — and victim groups may disagree — I never felt he crossed the line into illegality. I felt that what was going on was a toxic mess partly of my own making. And that meant taking responsibility for the relationship, and ending it myself.

Not calling the police, although I was tempted at times, but empowering myself through leaving of my own volition. That is the essence of why I believe the police must not be dragged into emotional abuse: giving over control of your private life, effectively, to an institution takes you even further out of the driving seat.

38 per cent of domestic abuse victims are men, according to the ManKind initiative chairty

Women need to take back control not give it away again.

Of course, this is desperately hard. Time and again I tried to leave my ex, then agreed to take him back — and I was extremely lucky we never managed to get married.

But eventually, I did tell him that I would not put up with his nonsense any more. Then I put the phone down and ignored the torrent of calls and voicemails demanding that we talk.

By standing by my decision, my self-esteem grew back. If the police had been involved, I do not believe I would have felt so strong or proud of my ability to help myself. Admittedly I had counselling, which gave me the confidence to deal with the break-up.

It is here that I believe institutions can help, by increasing the support available to women in difficult relationships. If I had simply had him arrested for ‘emotional abuse’, I would have learned nothing and walked straight into the arms of another man with the same personality traits.

Back in the driving seat: Melissa says those who suffer should take personal responsibility

And there are many, many more men out there who behave this way. Proponents of these new proposals might think a law change would stop them, but it would do the opposite. It would alienate these men further, given that such behaviour already stems from the emasculation they feel. I’ve often wondered if my ex felt threatened by my career and independence, which is why he set out to diminish and control me.

Bringing in laws that govern what men can and can’t say to their wives and girlfriends in their own homes will only further aggravate the feeling that they have no power.

On an individual level, too, prosecuting a man will bring him life-long problems that will only make his relationship with the opposite sex even worse.

I shudder to think how a jail sentence would have impacted upon my ex. With the loss of job and dignity, I fear it would have pushed him over the edge into goodness knows what behaviour.

Add to that the fact that it is impossible to define what constitutes ‘emotional abuse’, and there is far too big a grey area here. Such a law would be wide open to being exploited by women who want to punish their partners.

Surely it could lead to terrible miscarriages of justice if, in the heat of a row, a woman — or man — could pick up the phone in spite and involve the police.

I believe we have the legislation right already, with domestic abuse referring to physical violence and usually prosecuted under charges such as assault or battery. Extreme, threatening and intimidating behaviour can be covered by stalking and harassment laws.

Those who suffer, what Theresa May calls ‘non-violent harm’ would be better to take personal responsibility for their situation rather than seek help from the State.

Not only for their own good, but because this new offence would only create more victims.
