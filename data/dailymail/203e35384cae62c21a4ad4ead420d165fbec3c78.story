Manchester City midfielder Scott Sinclair has had plenty of time for off-field activities this season, and indulged in some underwear shopping with his girlfriend Helen Flanagan on Wednesday.

The former England Under 21 international, who has made just two fleeting appearances for City this year, was pictured walking hand-in-hand with his partner during a shopping trip at Manchester's Trafford Centre.

Sinclair's last appearance came in the final 15 minutes of City's 7-0 drubbing of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup in September, but the 25-year-old has failed to make his mark in Manuel Pellegrini's multi-million pound squad.

The midfielder, who enjoyed a loan spell with West Brom at the back end of last season, looked in high spirits as he visited underwear shop Boux Avenue and department store Selfridge's with his actress and model partner Flanagan.

Sinclair has struggled at the Etihad since his £6.2 million deadline day move from Swansea in 2012, with reports stating that Pellegrini will offload the player if the right amount is offered.

It is believed Sinclair, who has played for 11 clubs in his 10-year career, is currently on upwards of £40,000 a week - so he can certainly afford to splash the cash on his soap star girlfriend.
