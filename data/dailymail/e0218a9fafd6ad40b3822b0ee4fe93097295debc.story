A solicitor who was shot in the head at his firm's offices in Devizes has died of his injuries with his family by his side.

James Ward, 58, was shot by property developer Michael Chudleigh with a sawn-off shotgun on Monday July 2.

Mr Ward, who is the principal solicitor 
of the Morris, Goddard & Ward firm, suffered life-threatening head injuries and was airlifted 
to Frenchay Hospital near Bristol.

James Ward has died almost three weeks after being shot in the head by property developer Michael Chudleigh

Wiltshire Police said that Mr Ward died yesterday after almost three weeks in hospital. His wife Nicola, 55, and their three children had maintained a bedside vigil.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Saunders said: 'Our thoughts are with Jim’s family and friends at this time.

'Jim was a popular and well-respected man. At the time of his death, his family were with him and they have asked that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.

'I will now be working with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that the criminal charges faced by the man already charged with attempted murder properly reflect this change in the circumstances of the case.'

Chudleigh, 62, was initially charged with the attempted murder of Mr Ward.

Police said a post-mortem examination will take place later.

Accused: Chudleigh, shown at his former home in 2007, was charged with attempted murder. Police say they will work with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure the charges against him are updated in the wake of Mr Ward's death

A dishevelled-looking Chudleigh appeared to have two black eyes when he appeared at Salisbury Magistrates’ Court on July 4.

In addition to attempted murder, Chudleigh was also charged with three other offences against Daphne Courtney, a woman at the solicitor’s office.

They were possessing a sawn-off shotgun with intent to cause fear of violence, carrying a firearm with criminal intent to commit an indictable offence, namely murder, and making threats to kill.

The charges are alleged to have happened in the offices of Morris, Goddard & Ward in the Wiltshire market town of Devizes.

Chudleigh, of no fixed address, was arrested by armed police shortly after the incident at his former home in the nearby village of Rowde.

Chairman of the bench Antony Ebel remanded Chudleigh in custody to appear at Winchester Crown Court on July 18.

He said: ‘These are indictable only offences and will be transferred to Winchester Crown Court.

‘With regard to bail, we are going to remand you into custody.’
