A British student training to be a safari guide in South Africa died less than an hour after being bitten by a black mamba snake.

Nathan Layton, 28, did not realise he had been bitten while helping to capture the reptile at the college where he and his girlfriend were studying.

But within an hour, he complained of blurred vision, collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Couple: Nathan Layton and his girlfriend Laura Woolley. He was killed after a deadly snake was discovered in a corridor at the wildlife college where he and his girlfriend had embarked on a year long course

Mr Layton and his girlfriend Laura Woolley had left the UK in January 2008 to go on the year long course at the South African Wildlife College in Hoedspriut, pictured, in South Africa

The black mamba had been found near a
 classroom at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit and 
put in a plastic box by a staff member using a catcher stick.

Shortly afterwards, however, it 
escaped as Mr Layton and an instructor transferred it to a glass jar so 
it could be shown around the college. It was while helping to recapture 
it that Mr Layton was bitten.

Instructor Nellie De Kock said in a 
statement to an inquest in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, yesterday that after
 helping to put the snake in the jar, Mr Layton went to a class.

He then approached her to ask if a 
bite from a black mamba would bleed and she told him ‘no’. When she 
asked if he had been bitten, he was not sure and showed her his right 
index finger.

She said she asked him if he was 
aware of any tingling in his lips, arms and toes and he replied that he 
wasn’t. ‘He said he did feel the snake brush against him,’ said Miss De 
Kock.  ‘Thirty minutes into the lecture Nathan turned around and said 
“my vision’s going blurry”.

‘I realised immediately that he had been bitten and it took just a few seconds after that for him to collapse.’

Attempts to help him with CPR failed, and he died with his girlfriend Laura Woolley at his side.

Miss Woolley told the inquest Mr 
Layton feared he had been bitten, but Miss De Kock ‘had told him there 
was no visible bite mark so he was fine’.

She said no black mamba anti-venom 
was kept at the college and that the nearest supply was an hour away, 
but if her boyfriend had been given some, he might have survived.

‘Action should have been taken but because we were new we listened to our trainer,’ she added.

The couple left the UK in January 
2008 to go on a year-long course at the college and Mr Layton, of Wing, 
Buckinghamshire, died on March 4.

Coroner David Morris said the inquest had been delayed because South African authorities had not provided him with information.

Recording a narrative verdict, he said Mr Layton ‘died from the effects of a black mamba snake bite’.
