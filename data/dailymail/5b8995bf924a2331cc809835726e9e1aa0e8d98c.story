A teenage girl's weight dropped to just six stone after careless name-calling caused her to be gripped by anorexia.

In the space of a year, Deanna Carter, 17, lost four stone and three dress sizes after she was called 'thunder thighs'.

The student, from Gloucester, has since recovered, gaining weight and is now a healthy nine stone.

She is now keen for others to learn from her ordeal.

Deanna Carter, 17, dropped to six stone, left and right, and was just weeks from death after a family member called her 'thunder thighs', in what she describes as a 'daft little joke'

The comment resonated with Deanna, pictured before anorexia took hold, and she feel into a deep depression

'One of my family members called me "thunder thighs", she said. 'When they said it, they were just being silly - it was a daft little joke.'

Despite being innocent, throw away comments, they resonated with Deanna.

They provoked a deep depression, and manifested as voices in her head.

She said: 'It was a psychological problem for sure. It was every minute of every day. I went into a depression. I couldn't be bothered with life any more.'

The teenager became addicted to pro-anorexia websites, scouring them everyday.

She said: 'I was addicted. It was my Facebook.'  

Soon after, she began forcing herself to be sick, to speed her weight loss.

She said: 'It was something that I discovered one day. I did it every time I ate. It seemed like a natural way to get rid of it.'

By the time she dropped below seven stone, she began to experience heart palpitations.

At this point the joking had stopped and her family were becoming concerned, but Deanna remained in denial about her worsening health.

She said: 'I was so fearful, I thought I was big when I wasn't. I was in denial, I thought it was normal. I would have rather died than become fat.'

At her lowest weight, the teenager weighed just six stone and wore size four clothing.

She added: 'It was a psychological problem, for sure. It was every minute of every day. I went into a depression. I couldn't be bothered with life any more'

Under the insistence of her mother, Tracey, Deanna was eventually admitted to the Gloucester Royal Hospital before being moved to the Cotswold Recovery Spa, where doctors told her that if she continued to starve she would be dead in weeks.

Deanna's family, including her five siblings, rallied around her to encourage her to get better.

She said: 'If I bring up my weight now, my brothers  tell me to not be stupid. Many people tell me that they didn't think I was fat before all this.'

The teenager catalogued her year from hell in her diary entitled titled: 'An Unexpected Illness' which shows how the seemingly harmless jibes caused her life to snowball out of control.

Her condition resulted in her missing her first year of sixth form, but she has since returned to study business and drama and has ambitions of being an actress.

Her mother Ms Carter, 42, said: 'I'm relieved that Deanna was able to get the support she needed. She's still on the mend, but the support worker and therapists have been absolutely brilliant.

'I'm happy that we're not in the place we were last year. It was very difficult for all of us.'
