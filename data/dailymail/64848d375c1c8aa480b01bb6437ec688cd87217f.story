A walrus trainer, likened to rapper Kayne West for being 'outspoken', has promised to fight a Canadian theme park which has served him with a $1.5million lawsuit claiming he tried to steal one of the park's beloved animals.

Philip Demers today said he would fight his corner after being accused of the audacious plot to sneak in and take the hefty tusked animal from his former employers at Marineland Canada.

The lawsuit filed on Tuesday accuses the 'walrus whisperer' of becoming bitter after his idea for a reality TV show which placed him at center stage and likened him to West, was turned down by the attraction.

Close bond: Philip Demers is facing a lawsuit from his previous employers at theme park Marineland Canada. They claim he plotted to kidnap Smooshi the Walrus, pictured with him

Torn apart: Philip Demers left Marineland last year claiming he disagreed with the conditions for animals. The lawsuit claims Demers is bitter because the park refused to let him become a reality star

It claims that he was plotting to take female walrus, Smooshi, who was weighed at 365kg five years ago.

Since her 2004 arrival at the Niagara Falls park which boasts of rollercoaster rides amid beluga whales, killer whales and dolphin shows she followed Demers around and allowed him to pet her.

She was so enchanted with her trainer she quickly made the loved-up pair the park's star attraction.

The lawsuit claims the theft of Smooshi was agreed between Demers and others on October 7 last year.

It states they planned to 'unlawfully gain 
entry into Marineland at a time known only to them...in 
order to steal Smooshi the Walrus.'

Demers has denied the claims and counter-alleges that Marineland are trying to shift focus from his allegations that they don't care for their animals properly.

The trainer, whose relationship with Smooshi won him fame and numerous TV appearances, resigned his post in August after 12 years at the park.

The 34-year-old, who appeared on the likes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, has since blogged about the park claiming it is a 'house of horrors' with 'negligent use of chlorine' in the animal's water.

He is also calling for a change in animal protection laws throughout the country.

'The notion that I’m 
‘plotting’ to steal Smooshi is absurd,' he told the Canada Star today. 'I also doubt my second
floor apartment would hold a walrus.'

Walruses are found in coastal waters in the arctic areas of Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Greenland

Adult males can grow up to 12 feet long and can weigh more than 1,500kg

Females like Smooshi can grow up to 3 meters and weigh up to 1,200kg

The tusked, whiskered creatures dig in the sand for food but also tend to eat seals

Smooshi arrived at Marineland in 2004 from Russia at 18 months old

'I look forward to defending myself,' he added. 

He also told ABC News of his sadness at being apart from Smooshi, who he bonded with or 'imprinted on' when he helped care for her at the animal park when she arrived from Russia aged only 18 months. 

'Smooshi [the walrus] and I share an 
anomaly of a relationship which continues to inspire me, and I do dream 
of a day when we can be reunited,' he told the broadcaster.

'Her well being was
historically dependent on my being a part of her life, and it saddens 
me that she can't see me anymore. I miss her and all the animals a great
deal.'

Marineland deny the claims made by Demers.

In a statement on their website from owner and Marineland President, John Holer, they say animal safety is of their utmost concern.

'Marineland staff members and I 
consider each Marineland animal resident a member of the family. I will 
spare no expense when it comes to the health and well-being of animals 
in my care,' it states.

In November 2012 an inspection of the 
park by Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) reportedly 
revealed no problems with the conditions.

The park's lawsuit was filed at St Catharine's courthouse in Ontario, Canada.

It includes charges of trespassing and intimidation, alleging that Demers unlawfully entered Marineland property and intimidated its employees.

In happier times Demers told the Canada Star of his love of Smooshi. 

'She is completely subordinate. I can grab her head and wrestle with her 
and sit on her back. With any other walrus, you'd be in big trouble,' he said. 'She's the cutest thing on the planet.'

'If I leave, I'll take her with me,' he then joked.
