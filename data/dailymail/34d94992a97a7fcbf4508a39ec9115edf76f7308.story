An alleged terrorist who is accused of killing four people outside a Jewish museum may hold the key to identifying ‘Jihadi John’, the Briton who beheaded two American hostages and is threatening to kill British captive David Haines.

Security sources last night confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche had been questioned about the Briton, who appeared in two horrific beheading videos, after it emerged the Frenchman himself tortured Western hostages in Syria.

A former French hostage said that Nemmouche was guarding the same prison which kept Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and where 'Jihadi John' also worked along with three other British terrorists, who were nicknamed ‘the Beatles’.

Security sources last night confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche had been questioned about the Briton, who appeared in two horrific beheading videos, after it emerged the Frenchman himself tortured Western hostages in Syria 

Mr Foley and Mr Sotloff were killed by Jihadi John in two videos released by the terror group Islamic State (IS). In the second, he threatened to kill Mr Haines, 44.

A British security source has said that information gleaned from Nemmouche by French and Belgian intelligence agents about Jihadi John and other British captors has been passed to MI5 and the FBI, who are frantically trying to identify the terrorist.

Nemmouche, 29, will stand trial on Thursday for the murders of an Israeli couple, a Frenchwoman and a Belgian, who were killed after he allegedly sprayed bullets at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May. The French-Algerian spent a year in Syria fighting jihad for IS before returning to Europe to launch the attack in Brussels.

He was guarding an IS prison in Aleppo where most Western hostages were kept.

French journalist Nicolas Henin was one of those inside. He told his magazine, Le Point, this weekend that one of the captors was Nemmouche, who was particularly fond of torturing prisoners.

‘When Nemmouche wasn’t singing, he was torturing people,’ said Mr Henin, 39. ‘Every night, blows would start raining down in the room where I myself had been interrogated. The torture went on all night long.’

Mr Henin, who along with three other French journalists – Pierre Torres, Didier Francois and Edouard Elias – was released in April after a year in captivity, said he was also abused.

‘He looked at his hands, cracked his fingers like a boxer and adjusted his gloves,’ said Mr Henin, adding that Nemmouche used to ask him, ‘You see these motorbike gloves? I bought them to hit you. Only for you. Do you like them?’

All four have identified Nemmouche – who comes from the Roubaix area and spent at least a year in Syria as an IS militant – as one of the captors.

Marie-Laure Ingouf, a lawyer for Mr Henin, said: ‘All the hostages confirm it. They all lived with him for several months.’

Nicolas Henin described how James Foley had endured tougher treatment from captors because of his U.S. citizenship, but always behaved with courage and dignity
