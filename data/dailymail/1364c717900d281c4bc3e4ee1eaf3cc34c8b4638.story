This is the hilarious moment a squirrel was spotted wearing a plastic horse head.

Looking for a tasty peanut, the squirrel buried its face into a feeder in the shape of a horse's head.

But the animal did not know that he was being caught on camera by Florida photographer Jim Zielinski, 43, who had posed up the shot in his back garden.

The pictures were taken by Florida photographer Jim Zielinski who planned to take the perfect picture by suspending the feeder from a string and hiding a peanut inside

This is the hilarious moment a squirrel tucked his head into a feeder - shaped like a horse's head to munch on a peanut hidden inside it

Mr Zielinski, from Florida, went to great lengths to capture the perfect shot by making holes in the horse head feeder before suspending it from the branches of a tree in his back garden in the Sunshine State.

But what started out as a fun project has now become an internet sensation with Jim's pictures racking up over 1.5 million views online.

He said: 'As soon as I saw the feeder online I knew I had get some photos, I started setting it up pretty much immediately after it arrived.

'We currently have about seven squirrels living near our house, I knew it wouldn't be long before one arrived because there are usually a few waiting for us to come out and toss a few peanuts.

'The branch I tied it to was right above where we feed the squirrels by hand so they are used to eating there.'

Mr Zielinski quickly thought of how he could suspend the feeder from a branch and capture the hilarious scene.

He said: 'I decided to put a hole in the back of the horse head and tie another line to hold it straight, by doing that I managed to suspend it in the air.

The feeder looks up towards the horse's head which he knows has a tasty peanut hidden inside. Florida photographer Jim Zielinski said that the squirrels are used to being fed from this spot

'Initially, I thought of it as a gimmick and once it arrived I saw it as a challenge.'

But although the photographer had taken up the challenge of getting the animal to eat from the horse head he did not think he would be able to capture the moment on camera.

He said: 'I nearly fell in the pool laughing when I saw I got the shots because I honestly wasn't even sure they would ever actually go for it.

'As soon as I checked the camera I lost it, I ran into the house yelling to my fianc√© 'I got the shot! He actually ate from the feeder'.

'I was completely surprised and very excited to see the image on so many of the websites I check regularly, last time I checked it had over 1.5 million views.'
