The helicopter crashed about 18 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach on January 8

A remotely operated vehicle was used in the search for his body, during an operation that covered 500sq miles.Â 

The cockpit was spotted on Monday but rough weather conditions delayed the recovery operation until the following day.

A salvage vessel will now be used to hoist the wreckage out of about 70ft of seawater.

The cause of the crash is under investigation, but the first sign of a problem appears to have come at about 10.45am, when the crew radioed in a distress call.

The Sea Dragon is an unarmed two-pilot helicopter that uses a crew of up to six for operations such as towing heavy pieces of equipment.
