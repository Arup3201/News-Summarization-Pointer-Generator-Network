An Ohio man claims to have been detained and interrogated by Department of Homeland Security officers for three hours at the weekend, accused of being part of a major film piracy ring, after wearing his Google Glass headpiece to the movies.

The man, who wrote a detailed account of the incident to tech website Gadgeteer, said he was at the AMC cinemas in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday night with his wife when the incident occurred.

He was wearing Google Glasses - a 'wearable computer' shaped like eye wear that layers digital information over the real world - which he had his prescription lenses fitted into.

About one hour into a showing of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, the man said some 'federal service' agents snatched the glasses from his face and asked him to leave the theater.

Google Glasses are 'wearable computers' that were only recently released to a select market. They layer information over real life seen like a computer screen on one eye

The man said between five to 10 police were waiting outside for him and accused him of illegally taping the movie.

He told them it was a 'misunderstanding' and that the glasses - which cost him a total $2100 and are capable of being used to record video - were turned off.

The man and his wife were taken to a management office inside Easton Mall and interviewed separately.

'I kept telling them that Glass has a USB port and not only did I allow them, I actually insist they connect to it and see that there was nothing but personal photos with my wife and my dog on it,' the man wrote to Gadgeteer.

'I also insisted they look at my phone too and clear things out, but they wanted to talk first.

'They wanted to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I’m making, how many computers I have at home, why am I recording the movie, who am I going to give the recording to, why don’t I just give up the guy up the chain, ’cause they are not interested in me.

The incident occurred at this AMC Theatre in Columbus, Ohio, where the man involved in the incident says he goes every week with his wife

'Over and over and over again.'

The man that 'after a long time' someone came into the office with a laptop and USB cable and searched through the photos on his glasses, which were all of his wife and dog.

'I asked why didn’t they just take those five minutes at the beginning of the interrogation and they just left the room,' he wrote.

'A guy who claimed his name is Bob Hope (he gave me his business card) came in the room, and said he was with the Movie Association and they have problems with piracy at that specific theater and that specific movie.

'He gave me two free movie passes “so I can see the movie again”.'

The man said he and his wife were allowed to leave at about 11.27pm.

The movie started at 7.45pm.

In a statement, the DHS confirmed the incident, but maintained the interview was brief.

Staff at the Columbus AMC Theater are thought to have reported the man to police are suspected his Google Glasses were a special camera that he was using to pirate the movie he was seeing

'On Jan. 18, special agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and local authorities briefly interviewed a man suspected of using an electronic recording device to record a film at an AMC theater in Columbus,' the statement said.

'The man, who voluntarily answered questions, confirmed to authorities that the suspected recording device was also a pair of prescription eye glasses in which the recording function had been inactive. No further action was taken.'

AMC cinema also confirmed the incident.

'Movie theft is something we take very seriously, and our theater managers contact the Motion Picture Association of America anytime it’s suspected that someone may be illegally recording content on screen,' they said in a statement.

'While we’re huge fans of technology and innovation, wearing a device that has the capability to record video is not appropriate at the movie theater.

While this is a standard pair of Google Glass, the man involved in this instance had his prescription lenses fitted into the new technology so he could wear them all the time

'At AMC Easton 30 last weekend, a guest was questioned for possible movie theft after he was identified wearing a recording device during a film.

'The presence of this recording device prompted an investigation by the MPAA, which was on site.

'The MPAA then contacted Homeland Security, which oversees movie theft. The investigation determined the guest was not recording content.'
