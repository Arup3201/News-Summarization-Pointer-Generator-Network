Thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients are being illegally restrained by staff in hospitals and care homes, according to the care watchdog.

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) warns that carers and nursing staff are ignoring laws which state they must seek approval before depriving patients of their liberty.

Figures from the watchdog show that there is a backlog of nearly 20,000 cases waiting to be approved – and in the meantime staff may well be restraining patients anyway.

Under a law introduced in 2009, staff who want to lock patients in rooms, use sedatives or be otherwise physically forceful must apply for a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard.

They commonly are used for dementia patients to prevent them wandering off or hurting themselves.

Care home staff go to local councils and hospital employees to the NHS trust but almost half of applications are turned down as they are deemed unnecessary.

But the CQC says there has been a such a rise in applications that there is now a worrying backlog awaiting approval.

There were nearly 53,000 applications in the first six months of 2014/15, a seven-fold rise compared to the numbers submitted for the entire year of 2013/14.

Figures from the watchdog also show that there 19,429 applications awaiting approval with local councils and NHS bodies, up from 359 for the same period last year.

The CQC is concerned that staff are just using restraining measures anyway – illegally – while they wait for the paperwork to be completed.

David Behan, its chief executive said: ‘While we recognise the pressure local authorities are under, this represents a worryingly high number of people being deprived of their liberty without external scrutiny and authorisation.’

‘It is essential that all professionals looking after people who are unable to give consent deliver best practice in order to protect their rights.’

The huge rise in applications to councils followed two court rulings this year which stated individuals could be deprived of their liberty in foster care and sheltered housing.

Initially, staff had assumed the law only applied to hospitals and care homes – and particularly dementia patients.

George McNamara, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘However the backlog of unresolved requests is unacceptable, with nearly 20,000 outstanding applications at the end of September 2014.

‘This raises serious questions and leaves the worrying potential of a person being unlawfully deprived of their liberty simply because the paperwork is yet to be completed.

‘Depriving anyone of their liberty has to be a last resort, but when necessary it is essential it is closely monitored, legal and always with the best interests of the person in mind.’

In an annual report investigating the use of these orders, the CQC also uncovered harrowing cases of residents being illegally locked up in care homes.

One woman with Huntingdon’s disease – a progressive brain condition – was kept in a home for more than a year even though her husband had only wanted her to stay for two weeks.

Carers had decided it was in her ‘best interests’ to remain but delayed applying for a DOLS order for several months.

The family appealed via the Court of Protection where a judge ruled her human rights had been breached and awarded her £27,000 in compensation.

In another example, the CQC said staff at a care home were ‘routinely’ being too physically forceful with three patients when washing and dressing them including one who was given a sedative.

Staff had not bothered to apply for a safeguard order or even consider whether it was in patients’ best interests.
