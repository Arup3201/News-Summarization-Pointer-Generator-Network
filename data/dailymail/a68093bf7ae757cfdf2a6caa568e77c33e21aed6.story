Hackers have attacked the French Euromillions website, branding it 'the devil's work' and replacing lottery-related information with verses from the Koran.

A group, which called itself 'Morrocanghost', infiltrated the site on Sunday morning, forcing French operators La Francaise des Jeux (FDJ) to close it down.

In a series of messages, in both French and Arabic, the hackers urged users to give up drinking and gambling because they are tools used by the Devil to 'sow hatred between yourselves and turn you away from God and prayer'.

'Oh you believers. Wine, games of chance, statues all augur impurity and are the work of the devil,' read another.

FDJ said none of its other games were affected in the breach and that no personal data was compromised.

The Euromillions homepage was unavailable last night and is currently redirecting visitors to the FDJ page. The Arabic warnings have been removed.

However, Twitter user MorrocanGhosts posted a message yesterday in Arabic 
which read: 'After hours ... will penetrate the global gambling sites ..
(O ye who believe alcohol and gambling ...'

France has a population of 65 million, including an estimated four 
million Muslims, the largest Islamic population in western Europe.
