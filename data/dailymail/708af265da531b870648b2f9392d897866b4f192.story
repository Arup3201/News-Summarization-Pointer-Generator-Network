Prince Harry became the most senior member of the Royal Family to tweet this morning.

The fourth in line to the throne took to the 'twittersphere' to launch ticket sales for the Invictus Games, of which he is president.

Harry's tweet read @InvictusLondon: Hope everyone will get behind #invictusgames. Great opportunity to support and thank the men and women who have given so much. Harry

The prince quit his role as an Apache helicopter pilot, following a frontline role in Afghanistan, in  order to launch the inspirational Paralympic-style event  for injured servicemen and women.

On message: Prince Harry became the most senior member of the Royal Family to tweet when he sent this message launching ticket sales for the Invictus Games

Confirmation: A follow up Tweet from the Invictus account revealed that Prince Harry, pictured at the ticket launch, had been behind the message

Inspired by the US Warrior Games, The Invictus Games, which will be 
held in London this September, will involve more than 300 military 
personnel - some of whom have lost multiple limbs or their sight - from 
around the world.

Buckingham
 Palace has its own twitter feed @BritishMonarchy as does Prince Charles
 with @ClarenceHouse but neither he nor the Queen have ever tweeted personally.

Both
 accounts, which have 659,000 and 382,000 followers respectively, 
provide news, and diary updates, as well as videos and photographs of 
royal visits and events.

Prince
 Andrew does tweet - occasionally - on his own twitter feed @TheDukeOfYork signing his 
personal messages with his initials AY.

He
 sent his last personal message on April 30 following a visit to Boyle 
Heights in LA where he and rapper Will.I.Am met with young people living
 in the district.

The 
prince wrote: 'Spent time with some fantastic young people from 
#BOYLEheights in LA thanks for your inspiration and the leadership of 
@iamwill AY,' and also re-tweeted messages about the visit from the 
musician to his 44,000 followers.

His daughter, Princess Beatrice,
 also tweets from time to time from her @yorkiebea account, which has 12,000 followers.

Competitors
 from 13 nations - including Afghanistan, Italy and New Zealand - will 
compete in eight adaptive sports including athletics, archery, 
wheelchair basketball, cycling, rugby, swimming and volleyball.

Events will be staged in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park with track and field events at Lee Valley Athletics Centre.

In an impassioned speech at the top of 
the BT Tower in Central London, Harry said the games were a chance to 
support those who has suffered life changing injuries for whom sport 
plays such a important part in their rehabilitation.

He
 said: 'For many of those who have suffered life changing injuries, 
sport plays a hugely important part in their recovery  and life beyond 
as you have heard.

'This is particularly true for those men and women injured in the service of their country.

'By the nature of their profession these men and women are often very active and undoubtedly highly competitive.

'The Invictus Games this September will give these inspirational people
 the opportunity to showcase their talent and in doing so, prove that 
anything is really possible.'

He
 added: 'The Games do not stand in isolation but are part of a broader 
legacy; there are many fantastic organisations supporting those leaving 
the Armed Forces, whether injured or not. But we want to encourage many 
more to support where they can.

'I hope many other businesses will follow BT and Jaguar Landrover's 
lead in recognising the fantastic contribution that these men and women 
can make to their organisations.

'The four days of inspirational sport in September will allow us to 
highlight and applaud the character of these service men and women in 
the iconic Olympic Venues here in London watched by the best supporters 
in the world but this is just the start.

'I hope everyone will show their admiration by snapping up tickets when
 they go on sale tomorrow morning and cheering from the side lines.'

Joker: Harry joked 'This is why I joined the army, I can't type fast' as he composed his message on an iPad

Taking to Twitter: Invited to take hold of an iPad and send his first tweet, the prince looked nervous

Invited
 by Sir Michael Rake, chairman of BT, who are among those sponsoring the
 games, to take hold of an iPad and send his first tweet, the prince 
looked nervous.

'This is why I joined the army, I can't type fast,' he joked, as he looked at his crib sheet. 'Just keeping talking.'

He then managed to send his tweet with an exaggerated 'phew', and later joked Mayor of London Boris Johnson, an enthusiastic Twitter user, would be 'thrilled' to see him taking to the site.

Showcase: Harry said that the games would give 'inspirational people the opportunity to showcase their talent and in doing so, prove that anything is really possible'

Sir Keith Mills, chairman of the 
Invictus Games, admitted that Prince Harry is 'not the biggest fan of 
social media, such as Twitter.''

I had a board meeting of the Royal 
Foundation [of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry]  
earlier this week and when I told them he was going to publicly send a 
tweet they couldn't believe it. He really doesn't like it at all. But 
the fact that he has done this is a real indication of the importance of
 the Games to him.

Legacy: Harry said he hoped the Games would encourage organisations to support those leaving the Armed Forces

Competitive: Harry hopes the event will appeal to those who 'by the nature of their profession' are often very active and 'undoubtedly highly competitive'

Comrades: Prince Harry with former soldier Daniel Whittingham, who wore a special Invictus Games shirt for the ticket launch

'When he roped me in to help organise
 them he told me that he wanted to be involved in every aspect of their 
organisation - and so he has. Rolling up his shirt sleeves, attending 
every meeting. This is something he is incredibly passionate about.

'And how could you not be?'

One
 of the hopeful competitors is Daniel ‘Baz’ Whittingham from the Royal 
Logistics Corps, who was seriously injured in 2009 whilst serving in 
Afghanistan when the vehicle he was travelling in hit an improvised 
explosive device.

Participants: Prince Harry plays seated volleyball at the launch of the Invictus Games at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park's Copper Box in March

Support: Harry said the games were a chance to support those who has suffered life changing injuries for whom sport plays such a important part in their rehabilitation

Venue: Events will be staged in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (pictured) with track and field events at Lee Valley Athletics Centre

His 
injuries included two shattered legs, and after 18 months of treatment 
he had an elected amputation on his left leg below the knee.

Mr
 Whittingham said: “During rehab, sport plays a key part in every 
soldier’s recovery. Put them in a wheelchair, on a sitting volleyball 
court or in a pool and you will see a fire rekindled in their eyes.

'I’m really excited about potentially 
being a part of the Invictus Games and prove I am unconquered by my 
injury. And to do this alongside men and women that have all fought 
together, suffered together and are now competing together is a great 
honour.'

Some 40,000 tickets for the Invictus Games will go on sale tomorrow from 9am at www.invictusgames.org.

Tickets cost £12.85 per person per session including booking fee and postage.
