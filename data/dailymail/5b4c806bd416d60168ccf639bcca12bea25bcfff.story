The Queen was dragged into an extraordinary constitutional row last night as the Governor-General and Prime Minister of a tiny Pacific island nation tried to sack one another.

The Prime Minister of Tuvalu, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured last year, has despatched a letter to the Queen asking her to support his attempts to remove the Governor-General from office.

As the nation’s flag, with the British emblem in the corner, fluttered over the Parliament building, Governor-General Iakoba Italeli and Prime Minister Willy Telavi, fired angry words at one another as each demanded that the other step down.

The tit-for-tat row erupted in the capital, Funafuti, after Mr Telavi refused to allow parliament to debate a no-confidence motion in his government, which has ruled since late 2010.

Monarch: The Queen is still the head of state in Tuvalu

The Governor-General ordered the Prime Minister to remove himself from office, but Mr Telavi was hearing nothing of it.

Instead he fired off a letter to Buckingham Palace, informing the Queen that it was his intention to dismiss the Governor-General.

‘It’s is a very complex and confusing constitutional crisis that we’re facing,’ said a spokesperson for the Governor-General who officiates over one of the last outposts of the Commonwealth.

He said the Queen, who remains Tuvalu’s head of state despite the country of 10,000 gaining independence from Britain in 1978, had not yet given any indication whether she accepts the dismissal of the Governor-General.

‘Until we hear whether the Prime Minister’s attempt to remove him has been confirmed by Her Majesty he remains in office,’ said the spokesman.

Throwing a political spanner into the works is opposition leader Mr Enele Sopoaga, who told Radio New Zealand International that he was standing in as caretaker Prime Minister and he intended to oversee a no-confidence vote in Mr Telavi’s government.

The 15-seat parliament is expected to
meet next Tuesday and decide who should be the new Prime Minister - and
if that happens it is likely the Queen will be excused from being drawn
into the row.

Mr Telavi 
tells the world in his website that Tuvalu, lying about half way between
Australia and Hawaii, is an ‘undiscovered paradise’ with a unique and 
intact Polynesian culture.

He describes its white beaches and 
turquoise, crystal-clear waters and the natural friendliness of the 
people and their relaxed way of life.

The
Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the islands only once, in 
1982, when they were carried around in a ceremonial litter.

Princess
Margaret arrived there in 1978, but her visit was cut short when she 
fell ill with viral pneumonia and had to be flown to Australia to 
recuperate.

When 
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Tuvalu in September last year 
they danced the night away with flower garlands on their heads and 
traditional grass skirts on their hips.
