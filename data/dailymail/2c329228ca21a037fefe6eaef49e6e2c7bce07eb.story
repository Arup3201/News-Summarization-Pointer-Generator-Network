Looking back, George Ford gave a telling clue about the precocious talent and mental strength that England hope to harness on Saturday, when he scored eight tries in a junior rugby league match – at the age of nine.

He was playing against older boys. That didn’t faze him. He was playing against bigger boys. That didn’t faze him either. Such a scenario would become the norm in his fast-track rise to the heights. But back then, he also had to deal with good-natured banter from members of Wigan’s famous Farrell clan, which he duly made a mockery of.

George’s brother, Sale fly-half Joe Ford, recalled their formative years in both codes and told Sportsmail: ‘The biggest game that stands out for me was when George played for Saddleworth Rangers against Wigan St Pat’s, which is the team Owen Farrell used to play for. They are the biggest rugby league amateur club and George was in an age-group above himself.

‘At the time, my dad was coaching Oldham and Andy Farrell’s twin brothers played for Oldham. They were giving George a lot of stick before the game, saying that they were going to get smashed. The next day he scored eight tries.’

The prodigious playmaker who will wear England’s No 10 shirt for the first time on Saturday, against Samoa at Twickenham, grew up in a rugby household, but league was the code of choice. He and Joe would watch their father, Mike, play for Castleford Tigers and then act as player-coach at Oldham. From the age of four, George and his older brother would come along to training, watch the team in action and try to emulate them.

Keith Brennan was an Oldham player at the time and he went on to coach George at Waterhead RLFC. He said: ‘George and Joe used to come to training with Mike and you would see the pair of them with a rugby ball in their hands constantly. They were always practising their passing and kicking. For however long we were training, they would be doing exactly the same with the ball.’

Over the years that followed, the chosen practice location would be Churchill playing fields, up on the hills of Saddleworth, just outside Oldham. That is where Mike would take them to hone their kicking. When he was away, their mum, Sally-Ann, drove them there to train and train.

As a youngster, Ford took inspiration from rugby league star Paul 'Scully' Sculthorpe (centre)

It helped that there was inspiration at close quarters. Paul Sculthorpe, ‘Scully’, was our next-door neighbour and he treated us really well, like sons,’ said Joe. ‘He was always out the front, throwing balls around with us. He was George’s favourite player.

‘George and I always played a lot of one-on-one, so there was always a bit of competition. George always had a Saints shirt on with ‘Scully’ on the back. He never took that off. I was more mixed; I went round the houses a bit, but George was always loyal to Scully!’

When Mike’s coaching career took him from Oldham to a role with Ireland in union, his sons relished the opportunity for some informal tuition from Test players. As a surreal twist, years later George finds himself forming a half-back partnership at Bath with one of the players – Peter Stringer – who made him and his brother feel so welcome on their visit.

‘We went into Ireland camp with my dad,’ said Joe. ‘We spent a week with him, which was good. We got to work on our kicking with Ronan O’Gara and David Humphreys, which was great. It was just before the 2003 World Cup and we spent a week with them in Limerick. Peter Stringer was in camp then and he took us out for an ice cream!’

At school, George made a profound impression with his dedication and work ethic, in the class room as well as on the rugby pitch. Aside from a spell down in Hertfordshire – at the same school as Owen Farrell – while Mike was coaching at Saracens, most of his education took place at Rishworth School near Halifax.

The head of sport, Andrew Thomas, recalls how he quickly made his mark. ‘He came to us as a rugby league lad,’ he said. ‘He was a phenomenal player, but I don’t think he had played rugby union at that stage. He had obviously watched it and he knew about it, but all his skills were from league.

‘My first memory of George playing rugby union was a game on our pitches here; on the junior, Under 12-sized pitch. We were playing Woodhouse Grove, who are a decent rugby school. I was refereeing and it was the first time I had seen George play.

‘Their No 8 picked the ball up off the back of a scrum and someone had obviously taught him to run straight at the 10, to see what they were made of. So he ran straight at George and George just nicked the ball off him. He didn’t even bother tackling him, he just nicked the ball, ran to the other end and scored. No-one could believe what happened. I just stood there and thought, “Wow”.’

Ford made senior debut off the bench at Twickenham as a replacement for Farrell against Wales in the Six Nations.

The gifted tyro possessed all the technical attributes required, but what struck Thomas was the mind-set he had, which set him apart. ‘George was a role model here,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t just in his rugby. He had a full timetable but his work was always first in.

‘He was a grafter and well organised – all with a view to the rugby. From a very young age, he was exceptionally driven, knew what he wanted to do and appreciated the sacrifices that had to be made. At 13 and 14, he knew what he would have to give up and how to get the best out of himself.

‘It was clear that he would make it, not so much because of his skills-set, but because of his personality. More than anyone I’ve come into contact with, not just in an educational sphere but in all walks of life, there was no doubt he would succeed because he was so driven.’

That drive would ultimately propel George Ford into professional rugby union, where he became the youngest debutant in the history of the sport in this country – aged 16 years and 237 days – and was voted the IRB’s world Young Player of the Year in 2011. It also led to him switching from Leicester to Bath, in the belief that he was ready to play week after week, and run the show.

Brennan saw that trait in him too, when he was at Waterhead. ‘The thing with George is that he always stood out,’ he said. ‘He was a year below the other lads, but he was still the stand-out player. It wasn’t always because of the way he played rugby, it was also about the way he approached the game; his attitude. That’s probably the most impressive thing about him.

‘From a young age, everyone could see that George had a special talent, from the way he came across and the way he did things over and over again until he was good at them. He always seemed to be destined for great things. He will cope with it on Saturday, without a doubt. This is what he has always wanted to do. It’s like this was destined to be.’

Joe Ford has similarly strong conviction that his brother can handle the magnitude of what awaits him. ‘There are a lot of good 10s around but, speaking to him, he is quite determined to take this chance and keep the shirt,’ he said.’ The kind of character he is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he did it.’
