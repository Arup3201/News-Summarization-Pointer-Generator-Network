A pub landlady died in 'fantastically rare' circumstances after toppling over in her high heels on a night out, an inquest heard.

Tragic Sian Thomas, 38, tumbled in a nightclub after catching one of her white leather heels in the hem of her dress during a friend's leaving party.

She suffered bruising to her knee which developed into an embolism and she died two days later from a blood clot on the brain, an inquest at Worcestershire Coroners Court was told.

'Dreadfully tragic': Sian Thomas developed a fatal blood clot after falling over in her high heels on a night out on June 6

Miss Thomas, a landlady at the Berkeley Arms in Spetchley, Worcestershire, was 'in agony' the day after the fall, but managed to joke about the incident.

She told pals on Facebook about her 'good night' at Mode nightclub in Worcester on June 6.

She wrote: 'Had a good night for jenny's leaving party but slipped over in my heels and been to A AND E and i have bruised the bone on my knee !!! in agony, cant walk :(...'

A friend replied: 'hi sianey well that was silly wasnt it'.

Just hours after posting the comments, Miss Thomas was taken ill at her partner Rob McCairn's house and was rushed to Worcestershire Royal Hospital at 10am.

She tragically died the next afternoon, on June 8, after developing an embolism as a result of her fall.

A pathology report revealed she had developed deep vein thrombosis in her left leg from not being able to move it.

This led to a blood clot which went into her lungs and passed through a hole in her heart, before entering her brain.

Consultant Rosemary Johnson, who treated Miss Thomas, told the inquest such clots would normally be filtered out in the lungs, but the hole had enabled it to pass through.

She described the circumstances as 'fantastically rare', saying she had never seen it occur in her 15 years as an A&E consultant.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams said the incident was 'dreadfully tragic'.

Fast decline: Miss Thomas was rushed to Worcestershire Royal Hospital (above) on June 7, just hours after joking about her fall. She died the next day.

Miss Thomas's mother, Alice - supported by several members of her family - said her daughter was dedicated to her job, friends and family.

She told the hearing: 'She was the best. She was kind, caring and supportive. She had an excellent character - not a flaw.

'I accept these things happen. She was a good girl and it's a great loss.'
