Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, raged today during the first session of the commission looking into the violence that has torn their community apart.

They sat through three hours of talks before exploding and telling the panel: 'You do not reflect the community we live in!'

They shouted: 'Where were you when South Florissant was burning?’ and told the white commissioners they would never understand.

Community affair: Dozens of angry, frustrated people attended the first Ferguson Commission meeting held at the Ferguson Community Center Monday 

Emotions running high: Members of the audience sat through the first three hours of the six-hour meeting before verbally attacking the panel 

Post mortem: The commission has been set up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to examine the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting

A Post-It note put on the wall read: 'Start by calling the killing of Michael Brown what it was: a lynching. It was done to intimidate and “keep blacks in their place.”’

The six-hour meeting took place at the Ferguson Community Center, a short distance away from West Florissant Avenue, which was looted and burned last week after a grand jury announced it would not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Wilson, who is white, shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, on August 9, sparking more than a week of protest and rioting.

The entire episode sparked a national conversation on race and the militarized police response.

The job of the Ferguson Commission is to pick up the pieces and understand what has gone wrong.

But the dozens of residents who turned up grew increasingly frustrated as the panel took three hours to introduce themselves and offer well-meaning platitudes about what they were doing.

Some have expressed concern that the commission would turn into the governor's mouthpiece, while others addressed the violence and looting in Ferguson

They saw a huge gap between the intellectual talk before them and the pain they felt in their hearts.

One man said: ‘We sat for hours and listened to your resumes; we sat for hours and listened to your pedigree. 

'We don’t care. Did you mention the shot brother when talking about your resume?’

Another man shouted: ‘You want us to trust you. We don’t know you!’

Others said: 'Have you even been in Ferguson?' and: ‘This commission is a bunch of bullcrap'.

The meeting had been opened with a prayer and a call by co-chairman Rev Starsky Wilson told 'hold us accountable'.

Co-chair Rich McClure said that he wanted to have a 'truthful conversation,' even if it meant hard questions.

He said: 'We know that solutions can be found, and we can't expect others to change if we remain the same.'

But as the mood soured, an angry female resident said: ‘We’ve been sitting here since you guys started.

Out of touch: Some African-Americans in the audience accused the white panelists of being unable to understand their pain

Spreading the word: Community activists in the crowd used the meeting to spread the word about an initiative to help rebuild a local antique shop called Hidden Treasures that has been damaged by looters

Not impressed: Community members lashed at at the panelists for spending the first three hours of the event making introductions and presenting their credentials

'We are honored you all have credentials but you do not reflect the community we live in!'

Rev Wilson came out from behind his chair to calm them down, but they would not be silenced.

He was told by an emotional mother: 'Don’t waste our time with the same innuendo and the same rhetoric.

'You’re killing our babies. Fix it!’

One black woman addressed the white members of the commission and said: ‘You have not experienced our pain.’

Another Post-It note read: 'Mike Brown was wrong for stealing. Darren Wilson was wrong for being judge, jury and executioner.’

The anger shows the uphill battle that the commission faces, and how it has to first prove it is not just a mouthpiece for Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, who set it up.

In his opening remarks lawyer Gabriel Gore said he wanted to be 'part of the process of bring down the divisions that have existed in our community for a long time'.

Catalyst: Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, on August 9, sparking months of protest and rioting, which reached a fever pitch after last week's grand jury decision not to charge the cop 

Rage from coast to coast: Demonstrators protest against the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown during a rally at the Department of Justice in Washington Monday

Walkout: Student activists take part in the nationwide 'Hands up, walk out' protest at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri December 1

Movement: Protesters across the US have walked off their jobs or away from classes in support of the Ferguson protesters. Monday's walkouts stretched from New York to San Francisco, and included Chicago and Washington DC

Rev Traci Blacmon, a registered nurse who is pastor of the Christ at the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, said: 'I'm from Birmingham, Alabama. I'm a child of the Sixties.

'The issues I see that have arisen are the issues that I have been dealing with my entire life'.

She added that in Birmingham reform did not go deep enough and she was on the commission to have tough conversations and 'sit in discomfort until real change comes'.

She said: 'I'm here because it's personal. I'm here because I have two black sons. I'm here because I have a black daughter... Ferguson is everywhere.’

Fourteen of the sixteen commissioners were present and the other two were in Washington meeting President Barack Obama.

They were protest leader Rasheen Aldridge, who at age 20 is the youngest member of the panel, and Teach For America St Louis Director Brittany Packnett.

When he announced the commission, Governor Nixon said it was to look at the 'social and economic conditions' that led to the unrest over the past three months.

The commission has been given a $100,000 grant from the Missouri Development Finance Board but could need as much as $1million to finish the job.

Among the issues it is expected to look at are housing policies that have divided whites and blacks.

The excessive use of traffic tickets on black residents to generate revenue for the City of Ferguson will also likely be examined.
