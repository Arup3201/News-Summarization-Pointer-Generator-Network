A former Sunday school teacher who was convicted of racially abusing a family of travellers has managed to clear her name after nearly a year of fighting in the courts.

José Hampson, a grandmother of three who runs a toyshop, was fined £1,380 for allegedly launching a foul-mouthed race rant after scraping her car on a gatepost.

But she has now been vindicated after a court ruled that she was innocent and wiped her record clean.

Vindicated: José Hampson has been cleared of racially abusing a family of travellers

The former school governor, who had never been in trouble with the law, said she was 'absolutely sickened' by her initial conviction, adding that the experience was '11 months of hell'.

Mrs Hampson, 78, was convicted of racially aggravated harassment in August last year after Michael Linfoot, who lived on a traveller site near her home, alleged that she had called him and his family 'dirty f****** gypos'.

On Friday, she had the conviction overturned at Preston Crown Court, and will not have to pay any of the fines and court costs which were previously imposed on her.

Mrs Hampson has run Hampson's Toymaster in Chorley, Lancashire with her family for more than six decades, and is considered a pillar of the community.

Speaking after the hearing, the 
pensioner said: 'I was absolutely sickened to be convicted over 
something that was nothing more than a pack of lies and it is a great 
relief to clear my name.

'I
 was made to feel guilty of something I didn't do even though I always 
knew I was innocent. When I was convicted I couldn't believe it, and 
since then life has been dreadful. It has been 11 months of hell.

'I
 could not believe an innocent person could be found guilty in a British
 court of law and the whole thing has been incredibly stressful.

'My
 good character was destroyed and shopkeepers and the business community
 turned their back on me. My son now owns the shop and business and 
sales were affected. I could not allow this to happen.'

During the original
 trial, Mrs Hampson told the court she was returning home from the 
toyshop in April last year when she found the lane to her house partly 
blocked by a van which she had previously seen parked on an illegal 
traveller site.

She 
scraped her car trying to squeeze past it, so she decided to reverse 
back down the lane and turn around in the site's entrance.

She
 told the court Mr Linfoot came running over, shouting, 'What the 
f****** hell are you doing on my land?', but that she replied: 'You're 
not supposed to be on this land, it's green belt.'

Mr
 Linfoot claimed she then told him: 'Look at my f****** wheel' and 'I'm 
f****** sick of you lot, you're illegal, you should all f*** off you 
dirty f****** gypos.'

Despite her denials, Mrs Hampson was convicted and ordered to pay a £690 fine, £620 costs and a £69 victim surcharge.

She said: 'My faith in the British justice system has been really shaken. I should never have been convicted in the first place but now I'm just so happy I can finally put it behind me.

'I was so nervous on the way to court and I very nearly turned my car around but I knew I had to see it through. I want to forget about everything that's happened and move on with my life.

'Throughout it all, my family have stood by me and the support I have had has been amazing. I have had 11 months of worry and shame, but what was most important to me is that justice was done and I was vindicated.'

Crucially, testimonials from local people to Mrs Hampson’s impeccable character were read at the appeal, whereas she was denied the opportunity at her original trial.

Last night Mr Linfoot said he was disappointed by the outcome.

‘The judge said we were credible witnesses, he also said someone was lying,’ he said.

‘We continue to have faith in the police and if we believe we are victims of racial abuse we will call them again.

‘We are extremely disappointed in how the Crown Prosecution Service handled the case and we are considering a complaint.’
