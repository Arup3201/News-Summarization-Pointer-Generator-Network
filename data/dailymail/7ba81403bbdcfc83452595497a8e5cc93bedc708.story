These breathtaking pictures show how millions of pilgrims are arriving in Mecca for Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which starts tomorrow, as Saudi authorities warned they will stop any disruptive protests over the conflict in Syria.

The Grand Mosque, the focal point of the Islamic faith, was already teeming with joyful pilgrims at dawn yesterday, wearing the simple white folds of cloth prescribed for haj, many of them having slept on the white marble paving outside.

‘I feel proud to be here because it's a visual message that Muslims are united. People speaking in all kind of languages pray to the one God,’ said Fahmi Mohammed al-Nemr, 52, from Egypt.

Big event: Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as they pray inside and outside the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The annual pilgrimage draws three million visitors each year

Haj must be performed at least once in
 their lifetime by all Muslims capable of making the expensive, 
difficult journey, a duty that applies equally to Sunni and Shi'ite 
Muslims at a time of tension between Islam's main sects.

Saudi leaders have emphasised it is a strictly religious occasion and they are prepared to deal with any troublemaking.

‘If
 anything happens it will be brought under control,’ Interior Minister 
Prince Ahmed said on Saturday after attending a Mecca march-past where 
troops paraded water cannon, teargas launchers and even truck-mounted 
machine guns.

Authorities 
are keenly aware of past episodes of violence at haj, such as in 1979, 
when attackers seized the Grand Mosque, beginning a two-week siege that 
left hundreds dead.

Despite
 Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, locking horns with regional rival 
Iran, which is mostly Shi'ite, over the conflict in Syria and other 
disputes, the minister played down the risks of politically motivated 
disruption.

‘I don't think there will be any 
repercussion on the security of the pilgrimage as a result of what is 
unfortunately happening in Syria and elsewhere,’ Prince Ahmed said.

Saudi
 Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has backed rebels fighting Syrian 
President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, at a time of already tense 
relations between Riyadh and Tehran.

Assad
 and Iranian leaders have both accused Turkey and Gulf Arab countries of
 arming the rebels, while Riyadh has accused Tehran of stirring unrest 
in Bahrain and instigating protests among Shi'ite Muslims in Saudi 
Arabia.

Iran has denied 
those charges and both sides have said they are keen to avoid trouble 
during haj, mindful of 1987 clashes between Iranian pilgrims and Saudi 
security forces that led to hundreds of deaths.

In
 the years since, Saudi authorities have tolerated small protests by 
Iranians in their part of the massive camp where most pilgrims stay. 
Prince Ahmed said Tehran had assured Riyadh that Iranian pilgrims would 
cause no disruption this year.

Beginning: Wednesday is the first official day of the pilgrimage, with Muslims following a set form of rites laid out by the Prophet, and it culminates on Friday

However, Egyptian cleric Yusuf 
al-Qaradawi last week called on Muslims to ostracise Iran and Russia 
during haj over their backing of Assad, stoking an already tense 
atmosphere.

In his Friday 
sermon the imam of Mecca's Grand Mosque, Saleh bin Abdullah Hamid, also 
railed against the violence in Syria, calling on God to ‘be against the 
forces of oppressors’ there.

Pilgrims said they were praying for an end to the fighting.

‘I
 pray for the Syrian Muslims to be saved from the oppression they are 
being subjected to,’ said Abdullah Abdulrahman Mohammed, 69, from Iraqi 
Kurdistan, a father of 12 who had just performed Friday prayers.

Last
 year nearly 3million pilgrims performed the haj, with roughly a third 
from inside the conservative kingdom. The Saudi authorities said there 
have so far been 1.7million arrivals from abroad and about 200,000 from
 inside Saudi Arabia.

Mecca's
 merchants, famed across the Arab world, are already doing a thriving 
trade as pilgrims stock up on souvenirs such as prayer beads and mats, 
Korans, dates, gold and zamzam water, pumped from a holy well.

Together as one: The extraordinary gathering was said by some of the faith to be a visual message that Muslims are united

‘The first time I saw the Kaaba I cried with joy. I prayed for myself and all Muslims,’ said Nafisa Rangrez, 36, from Gujarat in India, who had waited five years for a haj visa.

All Muslims must face towards the Kaaba, the huge black cube at the centre of the Grand Mosque, five times a day for prayer, making a visit to the sanctuary a powerful experience. Pilgrims must circle it seven times when they arrive in Mecca.

Tomorrow is the first official day of the pilgrimage, with Muslims following a set form of rites laid out by the Prophet and culminating on Friday with the Feast of the Sacrifice, Eid al-Adha, a holiday across the Islamic world.

‘I would love to live here for the rest of my life. There's no such place in the entire world. This is a blessed country,’ said Ziad Adam, 23, a theology student from Kenya.

Saudi Arabia's king is formally titled Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the ruling family has long based its claims to reign on its guardianship of Islam's birthplace.

Over the past decade it has spent billions of dollars expanding the Grand Mosque and building new infrastructure to avert the stampedes and tent fires that marred past pilgrimages with hundreds of deaths. The last deadly stampede was in 2006, when 360 people were crushed to death.
