Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

Reports in Germany and Spain suggest that long-term Manchester United target Toni Kroos is on the verge of joining Real Madrid.

Respected German paper Bild, report that talks between Bayern Munich and Real are at an advanced stage and that the Spanish giants have offered the midfielder a contract worth £4million (5m euros) a year before tax.

Back off! Carlo Ancelotti has said keeper Iker Casillas is happy at Real while Barcelona close in on Ivan Rakitic

In Spain, El Confidencial, have extra detail on the move and claim that Real are just waiting to hear back from the 24-year-old's agent Volker Struth.

The news will be a blow to Manchester United who have long been linked with the midfielder and it was only a few days ago that El Confidencial reported that Louis van Gaal had personally called Kroos to convince him to come to Old Trafford.

Elsewhere in Spain, AS splash with quotes from Real boss Carlo Ancelotti saying that Arsenal target Iker Casillas is happy to stay at the Bernabeu.

Arsene Wenger wanted to sign the keeper to bolster his options at the back after Lukas Fabianski signed for Swansea. But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.'

Italian job: Ciro Immobile could start against England on Saturda after his hat-trick last week

Reunion: Ancelotti wants to bring Verratti to Real

Sport and Mundo Deportivo, meanwhile, both lead with the news that Barcelona are closing in on Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic.

In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport suggest that Real want Paris Saint Germain midfielder Marco Verratti, who Ancelotti signed during his spell with the French champions.

They also ask the question: (Ciro) Immobile or (Mario) Balotelli? After Immobile's hat-trick last week, coach Cesare Prandelli has a dilemma who to start up front. But the daily paper suggest Balotelli is still in pole position and that Prandelli doesn't see them playing together.   

Corriere dello Sport boldly declare that Italian fans want Immobile to start up top but Prandelli will go with Balotelli for Saturday's opening World Cup game against England.

Tuttosport take a slightly different angle and ask why Torino and Juventus decided to sell Immobile - who signed for Bourssia Dortmund earlier this month in a £15.6m deal.

They also carry quotes from former Juventus and Crystal Palace star Attilio Lombardo saying: '(Didier) Drogba and (Carlos) Tevez, what a partnership.' Could the Italian giants be lining up a move for the former Chelsea striker?

L’Equipe say Newcastle have offered French striker Bafetimbi Gomis a four-year deal worth £290,000 (€370,000) a year in wages, plus a £2m (€2.5m) performance bonus plan.

Gomis' has confirmed he will leave Lyon when his contract expires this summer and QPR, say the French paper, are also interested. Gomis, however, they claim is interested in move to Turkey with Fenerbahce and Galatasaray both interested.
