A British woman was been forced to move home from Australia after discovering she was recorded as a male on her birth registry - and now claims she is technically locked in an 'illegal gay’ marriage.

Mother-of-five Kim Walmsley, 49, says her world has been turned upside down after it came to light the registrar wrongly recorded her as a male when she was born in February 1965.

Mrs Walmsley says when she first noticed the mistake more than a decade ago when she applied for a full-time Australian visa she 'laughed it off' and thought it would be put right straight away - but after years living in the UK unable to move back she has turned to the Prime Minister for help.

Error: Kim Walmsley, 49, disocvered in 2003 that she had been registered as male at birth

Documentation: The details were later amended, but institutions including the Australian immigration office have told her the entry is legally binding - meaning she could not extend her visa

But she was then told the information could not be altered because it is a legal document - which she claims has made her 23-year marriage to husband Jack, 49, invalid.

The family, who were living their dream life in Australia, have since been forced to move back to the UK after Mrs Walmsley was unable to renew her passport due to the error.

Mrs Walmsley says the cost of the move and the paperwork trying to fight it has cost £150,000 - and the only person left who can help is David Cameron.

She said: 'The whole thing is absolutely disgusting. I’ve lived nearly 40 years not realising I was actually registered as a boy and then all of a sudden my whole life fell apart.

'It means my marriage is a complete farce because technically it’s illegal. We had a big white wedding in a church and spent a fortune and it was all for nothing.

'Invalid': A vicar at the church where Mrs Walmsley married told her that the birth certificate error means her wedding is not valid

'In the eyes of the law we were technically two men marrying and that was against the law at the time'.

Following her birth her parents were given a birth certificate correctly stating she was a girl - but it had been wrongly recorded in the register’s office records that she was a male.

Mrs Walmsley found out in September 2003 when she ordered a copy of her birth certificate so she could apply for a permanent Australian visa.

Although the General Registry Office accepted it was an error they said it was against the law to change it and there was nothing they could do.

Mrs Walmsley said: 'Since I found out I have tried everything I can possibly think of to get it changed but it’s like banging your head against a brick wall.

'As far as I know I’m the only person this has happened to and I feel like people don’t understand and nobody wants to help.

'We are a Christian family and it’s a massive problem to me that my marriage is illegal.

Marriage: According to church experts, the marriage recorded in the above certificate is not valid due to the error

'I want to marry Jack again as husband and wife but how can I when I’m still classed as a boy? It’s a disgrace. It’s clearly an error but due to statuary rules they won’t change it.'

The couple contacted five different solicitors and spent money on legal fees as well as the cost of moving back to the UK - around £150,000 in total.

They were told that their marriage in August 1991 was illegal and they never should have been allowed to wed.

A letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury in June last year apparently confirmed that the marriage was invalid in the eyes of the Church.

Mrs Walmsley, lives in Liverpool with her husband and their five children Jack, 26, Harry, 24, Jimmy, 23, Charlie, 21, and nineteen-year-old Melissa.

She says when the situation become known locally the family have even been the victims of homophobic abuse because of the 'gay marriage'.

She said: 'They’d picked up on what was going on and had told other kids at school that their parents were two men, even though I’m quite clearly a woman.

'There was a period of about two weeks when our home was vandalised and the word "queers" was painted all over the garage and the garden wall.

'Silly string was sprayed everywhere too and we were so scared we had to put up security cameras.

'We washed the paint off and the cameras stopped them doing it again but we were incredibly embarrassed by the whole thing.

'We live in a small community and we felt really intimidated. I’m worried about the stigma this is giving my kids and I don’t want people thinking I’ve had a sex change.

'Some people might think the kids are adopted and that I’m trying to hide the fact I’m a man.

'My death certificate will say I’m a boy too and so when I’m dead and buried, my family down the line will think there was this huge scandal.'

The family, who moved to Australia on a four-year visa in 2004, were forced to move back to the UK a year later after living their dream life in the Gold Coast.

Mrs Walmsley said: 'It has always been our dream to move there for as long as I can remember. We finally emigrated on a temporary visa and planned to extend it permanently after that.

'I’d found out the year before we went about the issue with my birth certificate but I didn’t think for a million years it would have any impact on my passport.

'Then, when I saw my passport was due to run out in 2006, I started looking into it. The rules said it is a criminal offence if your circumstances change and you fail to notify the passport office.

'I was terrified of what would happen but I knew I had to tell them. When I explained they said they couldn’t issue me a new one unless I managed to correct the mistake on my birth resigtrar.

'I felt sick with worry and I knew I had to come home to sort it. I thought if I didn’t, I’d end up stranded in Australia or worse, I’d get arrested.'

The pair, who had set up a successful magazine business in just three months, were forced to pack their bags and return to the UK after just under a year living down under.

Mrs Walmsley said: 'It hit us all really hard when we had to come home. At first I thought maybe I’d get it sorted but that didn’t happen and our temporary visa soon ran out.

'I feel like I’ve been a prisoner in my own country for ten years and I want nothing more than to enjoy a family holiday with my kids.

'We used to love going away together and I feel like this issue has not only affected me but it has deprived my children too.

'I’m not getting any younger and my time is running out. This has to stop.'

Mr Walmsley said: 'This has really battered us. We are at breaking point and I don’t know what to do.

It’s made a mockery of the whole system and yet a lot of people don’t seem to understand the seriousness of it. Our life in Australia was unbelievable and we’ve lost all that.

'We are a very strong family and I know we can get through anything but this has been difficult for all of us.'

Kim’s local MP Bill Esterson has taken on her case and has written to David Cameron asking for her birth entry to be corrected.
