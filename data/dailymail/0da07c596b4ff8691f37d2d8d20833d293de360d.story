A bronze statue of David Cameron riding a bicycle was sold for around £25,000 at a Tory fundraising party, it emerged today.

Conservative party donor Nathan Steinberg  bought the bizarre ornament at the United & Cecil Club's gala dinner in London – where Chancellor George Osborne was the guest of honour.

The statue, which portrays Mr Cameron on his bike as leader of opposition, was given to the party several years ago by its sculptor Margarita Hernandez.

Guests at last night's lavish do dined on Mediterranean vegetable terrine, chicken with goose fat potatoes and a lemon tart with ice cream with French wine and Champagne to drink.

One guest at the event revealed she had ordered Prosecco but was told she could only have Champagne.

Nara Hodge, who lives in David Cameron's Oxfordshire constituency, sent a Twitter message: 'Serves me right. Next time I'll know what to ask for!'

The United & Cecil Club has donated more than £400,000 to the Conservative Party since the last election.

Wealthy Tory supporters can give up to £7,500 without disclosing their identity as long as it is donated through a private members club like the United and Cecil.

Since the last election, private clubs have given all political parties more than £5.5million.

Mr Steinberg would not say how much money the gala dinner raised for the party. He said: 'It is a members' club. I cannot breach the confidence of our members. If you or anyone wants to join, they can apply.'

In ticket sales alone the evening raised at least £90,000, while adding at least another £40,000 through an auction, a source told the Guardian. Guests paid £250 a head to attend.

Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said the Tories had to compete with Labour's union backers. He said: 'We can't go to Len McCluskey for another million. This is how we do it.'

But Labour's Jon Ashworth called for David Cameron to reveal exactly who was funding the Tories.

The shadow Cabinet Office minister said: 'Yet again top Tories are dining with big money backers.

'The Tories' general election campaign is being bankrolled by a shadowy elite through this secretive group. The Tories want to buy the election by giving privileged access to a privileged few.

'Since the last election, the Tories have been given millions by unincorporated associations, organisations which don't have to declare where all their money comes from.

'We now need to know who is behind United and Cecil Club and the contact they have had with senior conservatives.

'David Cameron stands only for a privileged few. Is it any wonder when his most senior colleagues spend so much of their time time currying favour with vested interests?'

A Tory spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.'
