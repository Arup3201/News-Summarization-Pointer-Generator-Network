Former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, 59, allegedly went on a expletive-laden rant at his intelligence chief during a 2007 crisis meeting

The arch-federalist who David Cameron wants to block from a top EU job was accused of a 'dead drunk' expletive-laden outburst against his intelligence chief.

Jean-Claude Juncker - frontrunner to be the next European Commission President - allegedly made the rant during a meeting about a scandal which rocked his term as Prime Minister of Luxembourg.

The claims emerged in a 14-page missive which was written in German by a former intelligence agent and leaked to the media in Luxembourg.

The document, the content of which has not been verified, claimed Mr Juncker called the meeting in 2007 with Marco Mille, the head of the intelligence service in Luxembourg.

Both Juncker and Mille were battling headlines at the time over alleged illegal wiretaps by the Luxembourg security services.

Though Mr Juncker denied wrongdoing, his junior coalition partners withdrew their support with critics saying he had to take political responsibility.

Mr Juncker called fresh elections - before handing in his resignation last summer.

Leaked to the Luxembourg news magazine Paperjam, the document says: 'Towards evening we arrived at his office.

'It smelled of stale tobacco and an alarming scent of alcohol was in the air. Half staggering, he stepped out from behind his cluttered desk.

'Juncker was dead drunk, ordered himself two espresso and asked us to take a seat at the table.

'Without introductory words he began to insult Mille: "I f*** around where, whom, and when I want, do you understand me?

'"You could f***, but you cannot really do it, your German correctness... it forbids you."

'For about five minutes Juncker continued his massive offensive against Mille.'

It adds: 'After Juncker had drunk the two expresso... he went to the window several times to get some fresh air. He gradually calmed down.'

The account bore the name of André Kemmer, a former agent with Luxembourg's security services.

It was leaked to Paperjam in December and resurfaced today in The Times, which spoke to the intelligence service's former head of operations Franck Schneider.

Mr Schneider stood by the account, saying: 'The meeting took place exactly as Kemmer described it in the document.

Mr Cameron has privately said Mr Juncker 'cannot solve the problems of the next five years'

'It was unreal. He was very aggressive, very vulgar. I cannot say whether he was sloshed or stressed-out but he was not in his normal state.'

When the document was leaked, Luxembourg's media quoted the author as saying he had never intended it to be published.

Instead it was the first draft of a book which was meant to be a personal note of what happened, he said.

Mr Juncker, meanwhile, was quoted by Der Spiegel as denying the document's contents and said it being leaked to the media was a 'destabilising manoeuvre' to try and unseat him.

A spokesman for Mr Juncker told MailOnline: 'Mr Juncker's office will not engage on these issues.'

Mr Mille and Mr Schneider did not respond to requests for comment by MailOnline.

A founding father of the Euro who is proud to be called a federalist, Mr Juncker is the worst nightmare of Westminster's Eurosceptics.

The former Luxembourg prime minister’s bid for the top Brussels job has been strongly criticised by David Cameron, who said Britain could quit the EU if Mr Juncker was to succeed.

Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’.

He said Europe could not stick ‘its head in the sand’ and ignore the growing tide of Euroscepticism.

Mr Juncker, meanwhile, has fought back. He reportedly told a closed meeting of the European People’s Party in the parliament in Brussels this week: ‘It is wrong if we give in to the British.

'I will not be forced to get on my knees before the British. What bothers me is the gathering British press campaign.'
