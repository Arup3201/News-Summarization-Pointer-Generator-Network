From rows over a washing line to eating dodgy food, some of the more unusual ways the Victorians died have been uncovered in a series of notebooks found in a coroners' files.

A series of handwritten manuscripts, compiled by Thomas Taylor, County Coroner for Yorkshire from 1852 to 1900, spill the details on the ways more than 17,000 people met their demise.

Among the more curious cases is the wealthy Eliza Coulson, whose cause of death was recorded as being from eating bad beef and dubious dumplings in 1868. 

Coroners' notes: A series of manuscripts, written by Thomas Taylor, County Coroner for Yorkshire from 1852 to 1900, have revealed some of the more unusual ways thousands of people met their demise

Inquest: The notebooks record details of hearings into sudden, accidential and mysterious deaths

Manuscripts: Jennie Kiff, research archivist at the West Yorkshire Archive Service, based in Wakefield, works her way through some of the coroners' notes

Sarah Hughes meanwhile died from natural causes 'accelerated by fright occasioned by riotous proceedings of a mob'.

From mining disasters to natural causes, the notebooks, property of West Yorkshire Archive Service, record details of the inquests into sudden deaths, accidental demises and mysterious ends.

But not all the deaths recorded in the notebooks were natural or accidental.

Sarah Ann Koyton died suddenly in 1889 from 'excitement and passion' after a row with a neighbour over a washing line. 

In 1864 the verdict at the inquest on
 19-year-old Keziah Booth suggested foul play after Keziah’s deathbed 
statement, written up in the notebook, accused her lover, William Dawson
 of poisoning her as she was 'in the family way'.

Eye-witness accounts and details of people’s lives are recorded in the 
notebooks, providing a fascinating insight into life and death in 19th 
century Yorkshire.

Lifestyle: The manuscripts offer a glimpse into life in Victorian Yorkshire. Pictured is a street in Bradford in the late 19th century

Notebook: One of the cases describes someone's thoughts after eating suet and subsequently dying of food poisoning, as 'It's not fit to use'

Assets: The files, which provide eye-witness accounts along with personal details of people's lives, are hoped to become a useful tool for researchers and historians

Records: The notebooks, property of West Yorkshire Archive Service (pictured), record details of the inquests into sudden deaths, accidental demises and mysterious ends

Conditions: A number of washing lines can be seen across this Bradford street in the late 19th century

The alphabetical list of names is hoped to become a useful asset for researchers and historians.

Graham Hebblethwaite, chief officer of West Yorkshire Joint Services, which oversees the work of the Archive Service, said: 'Finding out about these inquests can help us understand our family history on a much more personal level.

'Our new Ask the Experts service can help to find out a lot more about these events and the lives of your families.'

Councillor Val Slater, chairman of the archive, archaeology and trading standards committee, said: 'These notebooks make fascinating reading. They are like opening a window into another world.'
