Google's 'on-body detection'  users the phone's accelerometer to know when it's being moved and will only lock when placed on a flat surface

Google has already experimented with unlocking phones  using  faces, but for some this just isn't immediate enough.

A number of Android owners have spotted a new feature that keeps the phone constantly unlocked as long as it's in a person's hand, resting on their leg or even just sitting in a pocket.

The 'on-body detection' feature uses the phone's built-in accelerometer to know when it's being handled or moved, and will only lock the screen when placed on a flat surface.

On-body detection was first spotted by  fan site Android Police in the Smart Lock menu of a Nexus 4 running Android Lollipop.

But there have since been numerous reports of the phone appearing on other Lollipop devices, and not just Google's own Nexus range. 

It appears to be linked to the most recent version of Play Services -  a tool used to update Google's built-in apps. 

The on-body detection menu explained: 'The feature uses your device's accelerometer to detect whether your device is still being carried on the body.

'If your device detects that it's no longer being held, your device won't stay unlocked.'

The phone has to be unlocked the first time it is picked up in the morning but once unlocked it will stay open until it is put on a table or similar.

But as Google added, if the user unlocks their device and hands it to someone else the phone or tablet stays unlocked as long as the other person continues to carry it.

It is also unclear how active the screen will be in a pocket.

Google may shut down services but keep the screen unlocked, to avoid opening apps or accidentally calling people, known colloquially as 'butt dialling.'

Google offers passwords and PINs to secure its phone, and more recently added Face Unlock (pictured) to phones  running Android Ice Cream Sandwich and above. It recognises a person’s face and can establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph

These services may then be enabled once the phone detects it is in a person's hand. 

It is also not clear what impact having the screen constantly unlocked will have on battery life.

MailOnline has contacted Google for more information.

A combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you, not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you.

The cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions.

These security features are opt-in, meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and PINs to unlock devices and features if they so desire.

On-body detection is the latest feature hoping to remove the need to enter security details regularly.

Last week Microsoft said devices running its Windows 10 software, which launches later this year, can be unlocked by looking at them, or using a fingerprint reader. 

Apple made the fingerprint reader, or Touch ID, mainstream on its iPhone 5S and Samsung added a reader on its Galaxy S5. 

Microsoft's version is called Windows Hello, it will be part of Windows 10 when it launches later this year.
