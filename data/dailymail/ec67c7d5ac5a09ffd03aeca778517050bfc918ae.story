Investment banker Timothy Brooks stole nearly £600,000 from wealthy clients to fund his gambling

An investment banker who stole nearly £600,000 from wealthy clients to fund his gambling habit has been jailed for two years.

Timothy Brooks, 42, who was employed at the Mayfair Private Banking Service division of Lloyds TSB Banking Group, plundered money from the private banking accounts of customers over a six-year period.

The married father-of-three pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to 17 counts of fraud, with withdrawals totalling £573,736 diverted to bank accounts he set up in the names of his children.

He revealed that he had deliberately 
chosen customers with the biggest portfolios who were least likely to 
notice thousands going missing.

The
 money was stolen in 57 separate transactions - but went unnoticed until
 a processing error led to one of the payments being looked at more 
closely last July.

The 
matter was reported to police last summer after Brooks’ colleagues at 
the Manchester private banking division discovered he had transferred 
money from the accounts of 17 customers since September 2007. Officers 
from Greater Manchester Police’s economic crime unit went on to search 
Brooks’ home in Prestwich.

Mark
 Ford, defending Brooks in court, said that at the time of the thefts 
Brooks was in the 'vice-like' grip of a gambling addiction.

Huge sums were spent on casino tables and online sports betting with companies including Grosvenor Casinos.

The charges relate to 17 separate accounts, including portfolios held by married couples.

One of the victims had befriended Brooks at social events held by the bank, and two others died before the case got to court.

Brooks began working for the bank in 1990, and was earning £34,000 as an assistant to a customer relationship manager at the time of his arrest.

Charlotte Crangle, prosecuting, told the court that Brooks passed off the payments as account charges, copying colleagues' electronic signatures to make them look as if they had been signed off.

The customer who suffered the highest loss had £94,988 stolen between May 2010 and April last year, with payments of up to £15,000 taken in consecutive months.

Brooks was also 'robbing Peter to pay Paul', Miss Crangle said, transferring money between customer accounts to disguise his theft.

Miss Crangle told court that customers - who have been reimbursed by the bank - felt 'shock and annoyance' at what had gone on.

Mr Ford said Brooks was 'deeply sorry' for his crime, but argued the sentence should reflect that no individuals had 'borne the loss'.

Describing how a man known as 'kind, decent and fundamentally honest', came to be in this 'dreadful position', Mr Ford said he had a severe addiction, which 'exerts a vice-like grip and feeds on itself, destroying everything'.

Miss Recorder Goode, sentencing, told Brooks his crimes were a 'gross breach of trust', adding: 'It's tragic to see a man such as yourself before the court.'

Following sentencing, detective constable Beth Colbourne said: ‘Brooks completely abused his position and the trust that was placed upon him by both his employers and his clients to steal more than half a million pounds from the accounts of his customers.

‘However, Brooks’ deceit was uncovered by his colleagues and the police were brought in to investigate him and today he has rightly been put behind bars.’

She added: ‘Brooks thought he could get away with his illegal activities, but he was wrong. Let this serve as a warning that any fraudulent activity will always be uncovered in the end, and you will be made to pay for your actions, ruining not only your life and causing distress to all those that you have stolen from, but devastating the lives of your family too.’

Susan Taylor, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: ‘Timothy Brooks held a position of trust at Lloyds Bank. He was responsible for managing millions of pounds of investors’ money.

‘However, over a six-year period he abused the trust of the bank and the investors by re-directing funds into the bank accounts of his children, which he then used to fund his gambling habits.

‘We are pleased that Brooks has now taken responsibility for his dishonest actions. This case is an example to others who think that committing fraud to gain large amounts of money is an easy option; they are not above the law and will be brought before the courts.’
