BBC Sport’s desire to use commentators across TV and radio led to Alan Green’s highly surprising Match of the Day debut at West Bromwich on Saturday.

The 62-year-old Green has long been annoyed about MotD showing no interest in using him while other ‘inferior’ BBC radio voices have been given their opportunities.

Green vented his upset in his autobiography in 2000, calling the BBC behaviour towards him ‘infantile’, adding: ‘There’s no point in false modesty. I know that I’m a good commentator. I don’t believe there is a good reason why I couldn’t make the move to television. Nor do I believe there’s any good reason why I shouldn’t have made that move, particularly since I’ve seen rather ordinary broadcasters move across. They know who they are and you should too.

‘Television is clearly happy to do without me. The feeling is mutual.’

But 14 years on the Beeb management say ‘the past is the past’ and intend to give Green further games on Match of the Day despite the mixed reaction on Twitter to his first commentary, a 2-0 win for Everton at The Hawthorns. Green has also been doing reports for BBC’s Final Score.

A BBC spokesperson said: ‘We have a wealth of top-class commentators available to us across both TV and radio. MotD commentators have been used on 5 Live regularly in recent years while Alan Green and others have featured in our TV football programming and will continue to do so.’

Kevin Pietersen could be in trouble if his autobiography conflicts with his confidentiality contract with the ECB

The battle between the ECB and Kevin Pietersen over the outcast cricketer’s upcoming autobiography has begun after his agents Mission announced the book publicity tour. This starts at the Monastery in Manchester on October 7 — two days before publication — when a copy of the book is included in the £22 ticket price for ‘An evening with Kevin Pietersen’. 

The schedule alerted the ECB, who have not been shown the book and it is understood they have sent letters to Little, Brown reminding them of Pietersen’s confidentiality contract and asking to see the book in advance of it going on sale. Maddie Mogford, legal director of Little, Brown, declined to comment.

Supermarket tycoon Colin Graves bankrolls county cricket champions Yorkshire

Supermarket tycoon Colin Graves, who bankrolls county champions Yorkshire, is responsible for another sporting sponsorship that brought great results. Graves backed Andy Murray at the start of his career, with the Cost-cutter funding ensuring 2013 Wimbledon champion Murray could go to the Sanchez-Casal tennis academy in Barcelona.

The FA’s delegation in Geneva for Friday’s UEFA decision on the venues for Euro 2020 has unlikely past and present Ministers of Sport in the party. Helen Grant is representing the Government while London Mayor Boris Johnson is sending his commissioner for sport Kate Hoey, who was minister during the Blair Government. 

Hoey is far more steeped in football. But on the day she was appointed in 1999, Manchester United pulled out of the FA Cup to play in the World Club Championship and obnoxious control freak Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief, ordered her not to say anything about United’s controversial move. Wembley is the overwhelming favourite ahead of Munich to stage the Euro 2020 final.

Graves, who founded Costcutter, also backed tennis star Andy Murray during the early years of his career

Sky Sports made a big noise about their extensive 3D coverage at the 2010 and 2012 Ryder Cups. But the doomed format appears to have been kicked into the long grass with a substantial multi-million pound loss. There are no Premier League matches yet scheduled to be shown in 3D this season while Sky have moved on to testing 4K — ultra high definition — at next week’s Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

FA chairman Greg Dyke’s reform of work permit regulations for footballers from non-EU countries proposes the scrapping of appeals, reducing permitted countries to those ranked in FIFA’s top 50 and stopping loan deals involving permit players. Surely Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, often the FA’s biggest obstacle, cannot object to these measures.
