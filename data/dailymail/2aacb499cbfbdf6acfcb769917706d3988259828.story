Neil Warnock has backed Brendan Rodgers to succeed Roy Hodgson as the next England manager, but doesn't believe the Liverpool boss will be leaving his post any time soon.

In an interview with Talksport, Warnock spoke about England's World Cup failure, and how they can go forward from it. But he also doesn't believe that Hodgson will leave the job 'in a million years.'

When called upon to name who he thought should be England's next manager, the former Leeds and QPR boss felt that the FA need look no further than Merseyside.

Next in line? Brendan Rodgers should be the next England manager, according to Neil Warnock

Possibility: Everton boss Roberto Martinez could also take the helm

Contender: Hull boss Steve Bruce could also be a possibility

He said: 'I think if you look at Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and Roberto Martinez at Everton. They wont leave, but [the FA should] give somebody like that a five-year contract and say "go with the kids".

'He (Rodgers) changed Liverpool around. He went in there and knew how they wanted to play straight away, got Andy Carroll out and got them playing.

'And on the international scene it's got to be like that.

'His major 
problem is if Luis Suarez is now swallowed up by Real Madrid or 
Barcelona, because if he is, Liverpool will not be anywhere near the same
 team.

'Like with Gareth Bale, when they want somebody they go out and 
get them. If I was Brendan I'd be more concerned than I was last 
summer.'

Warnock also believes that Rodgers will be 'delighted' if his captain Steven Gerrard calls time on his international career.

'The temptation will be to break the (England cap) record, but he has done the right thing to sleep on it.

'He's
 had a hell of bad a season at the end with the mistake against Chelsea,
 emotionally he's never recovered from that, and you could tell from his
 play at the World Cup.'

Warnock 
also mentioned Steve Bruce as a possible contender for the England job, 
following his successes with Hull over the past couple of seasons.

'He
 has taken Tom Huddlestone and made him into a player, the kind of 
player you need at the World Cup, even though I'm not a fan of his.'

Pointing the way: Warnock believes England should look to youth in both playing and management roles

And when pressed about current incumbent Hodgson's position with the national side, Warnock added: 'I don't think Roy will (leave) in a million years. Because he's not going to get another chance like this.

'If they lose to Costa Rica I dont think they'll blame him. I'd be surprised if he doesn't play Barkley, Wilshere and Shaw, so if he does lose it will just be a case of "I wanted to give the kids a game".

'I don't think (defeat) will change anything. I just don't think (Greg) Dyke should have come out after two games and say something he didn't need to say.

'I think he just wanted to support him, to lose both games it's terrible.

'He's trying to be clever, but it didn't warrant that, he could leave it until after (the World Cup), but there's got to be some sort of inquest into the situation.'
