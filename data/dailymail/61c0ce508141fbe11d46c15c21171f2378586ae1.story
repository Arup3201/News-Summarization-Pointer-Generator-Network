A so-called super slimmer who lost half her body weight has managed to keep it off for 12 years - by carrying a constant reminder that she once looked like Mr Blobby.

Lisa Rennison carries about her person a photograph of herself when she looked like the big pink puppet, and calls the photo her 'thinspiration'.

Lisa, 40, was inspired to lose the weight after an encounter with a too-tight pair of trousers in an Marks & Spencer changing room left her crying tears of shame.

Overweight as a child, a lifetime of unhealthy eating had seen her weight soar to 12st, which at 5ft 2in put Lisa in the dangerously overweight category.

Weight loss: Lisa Rennison, 40, was obese all her life - but after losing six stone 12 years ago, has managed to keep the weight off thanks to a photo of herself at her biggest, right, where she says she looked like Mr Blobby

With the painful reminder of the M&S changing room in the back of her mind, in just six months Lisa managed to drop to a healthy 7st, dropping from a size 18 to a size 6.

Lisa lost the weight through simple exercise and a strict diet - but feared she would start slipping back into her bad old ways.

So she took a photo of herself at her biggest and has carried it with her ever since, putting it on her desk at work to stop her indulging in cakes at the office.

Lisa, a customer service manager from Peterborough, Cambs., says her 'thinspiration' has worked so well she is now training to become a fitness instructor.

She said: 'I remember I was in Marks & Spencer's trying on a pair of trousers and I just looked in the mirror and broke down.

Lifelong struggle: Lisa,

centre, says she was always 'chubby' and school bullies dubbed her 'fat 
a***'

'I was trying on a size 18 pair on in the store and I was just horrified by my size.

'I remember crying in the mirror, I had never felt so low or insecure about the way I looked. I was at my lowest.

'A couple of days later I took a photograph of myself and this is the picture I carry around with me.

'It was such a horrible and difficult time and whenever I look at the photograph it makes me put down the treats and sweets and reminds me of just how terrible I felt.

'I turned 40 this year and people often say I look younger now than I did in my twenties - I feel much younger.'

Baby weight: Lisa, pictured aged 25 with her son Ben, says her struggles really began after the birth of her first child, when she saw her weight soar to 12st

Always a chubby child, Lisa was 
called 'fat a***' by bullies at school. But it was after the birth of 
her son Ben, now 15, that her weight really spiralled out of control.

She dieted by cutting out bread and 
chocolate and lost a stone in a month and followed it by stopping greasy
takeaways and fast food.

The mother-of-one added: 'I didn't use Slimming World, or Weight Watchers or muscle in on any fad diets. I literally stopped eating the rubbish.

'I stopped eating the chocolate and the cakes. I looked at my portion sizes and got rid of the takeaway meals.

'Ultimately I used to eat like a pig and I'm only a small frame so for as long as I could remember I had always been a curvy and big.

'My new diet wasn't anything special; it was just a common sense diet.

'I lost a stone in six weeks through healthy eating and that set the ball rolling. In six months I was down to a size 12.'

After losing the pounds she joined a gym in 2010 where sessions five times a week transformed her into a toned size six.

She added: 'Looking back at the photograph reminds me of all the bad feelings I had. It's what I like to call thinspiration.

'When I celebrated my 30th birthday I was a healthy size eight and that was a big moment for me.

'Around eight years ago I started cycling, I joined the gym. Fitness was key to getting rid of the rest of the weight to get me down to how I am now.

'I never want to go back to looking like I did before this is why I remind myself daily - I remind myself how much I've achieved and how much happier I am within myself.'

Reminder: After a lifetime of unhealthy eating the mother-of-one lost six stone - and is now determined never to put it back on. She says the photo helps stop her nibbling on unhealthy foods

Thinspiration: Slender Lisa now carries the photo with her at all times to remind her to keep away from sweet food and takeaways
