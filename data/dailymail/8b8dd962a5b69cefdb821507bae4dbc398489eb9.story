Car giant General Motors have been forced to pull an advert after its jingle - which claimed that Chinese people sing 'ching-ching, chop suey' - was accused of being racist.

In a humiliating u-turn, the company has removed the advert from worldwide markets after it referred to China as 'the land of Fu Manchu'.

The advert was promoting the Chevrolet Trax SUV, and had been aired in Canada since the beginning of April.

The advert for the Chevrolet Trax SUV disappeared from Canadian TV screens about a week ago, and was replaced with a new ad without lyrics

It had been posted to Chevrolet’s European website too - but has now disappeared from Canadian TV screens and replaced with an edited version without the offensive lyrics.

A company spokesman blamed 'negative feedback' in response to the lyrics

A spokesman told the South China Morning Post: 'Once the issue was called to our attention, GM immediately removed the offensive content from the commercial'

'As the goal of advertising is to engage an audience and draw their attention to a featured product and it is never our intention to offend the audience, we made a decision to edit the advertisement.'

The video with the lyrics have now been erased from websites across the internet.

The TV advert, called 'After Midnight', features the song Booty Swing by Austrian musician Parov Stelar.

The lyrics on the offending advertisement say: 'Now, in the land of Fu Manchu, The girls all now do the Suzie-Q, Clap their hands in the centre of the floor, Saying "ching-ching, chop suey, swing some more".'

The Trax is in the process of being launched in various markets worldwide, excluding America.

It is already on sale in South Korea and will soon be made available in Europe and Canada.

Last month the car manufacturer announced plans to launch 17 new or updated models in China, the Economic Times reported.

China is the world's largest car consumer, and GM is keen to begin capitalising on the country's luxury auto market.
