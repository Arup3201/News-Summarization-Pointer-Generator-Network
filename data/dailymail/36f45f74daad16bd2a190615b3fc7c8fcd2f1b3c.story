It brought traffic to a standstill in Newcastle, saw 500
revelers being thrown out of a club in Cardiff and it has has rocked Premier
League grounds up and down the country.

And it's not only the stadiums of Anfield and the Etihad
that have been unable to control themselves on hearing the opening bars of
bass...

Even Joe Hart admits even he gets carried away and enjoys
joining in with Manchester City's cult 'Yaya-Kolo Toure' chant.

Drivers in Newcastle were left bemused when traffic was
stopped for 10 minutes by a group of students breaking out Yaya's version of
the song (although in truth there is little between them).

Scroll down to watch the Joe Hart interview with Umbro in full...

Going ga ga for Yaya: Joe Hart admits he loves the cult Toure chant and ties to join in if he can

Brothers in arms: Yaya (left) and Kolo (right) Toure are two of football's best loved siblings

Eyes on the prize: Hart hopes to help Manchester City to Capital One Cup glory at Wembley this weekend

Over 500 revellers in a Cardiff nightclub also erupted in
unison after being asked to leave the venue - alternating the chant between
both the brothers' names.

Yaya and Kolo Toure boast two syllable names tailor-made for
the now infamous terrace chant to the tune of 2 Unlimited's smash hit No Limit,
which may lack lyrical imagination but is guaranteed to get all and sundry
singing along - including the England No 1.

Speaking to two young interviewers in a special video for
boot makers Umbro, Hart was asked about his favourite song from the City
supporters.

And he admitted the Toure song is head and shoulders above
the rest.

'I like it when they do the Yaya and Kolo one, with the
hands,' he said.

'I try and join in if I can.'

On the spot: Hart was grilled by two young Manchester City supporters

The England goalkeeper is preparing for back-to-back games
at Wembley with Sunday's Capital One Cup Final against Sunderland before
Wednesday's international friendly with Denmark.

Hart, 26, is hoping City will win the first of four
potential trophies this season at the weekend with Manuel Pellegrini's side
gunning for glory in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.

Although success in Europe appears unlikely this year
following last week's 2-0 defeat by Barcelona, Hart is in an upbeat mood ahead of
City first crack at a quadruple.

Heads, you lose: Ben Watson's goal saw Wigan sink City in the FA Cup Final at Wembley last season and Hart is hoping to avoid a similar upset against Sunderland

Up four it: City are chasnig an unprecedented quadruple this season, although their chances in the Champions League look slim after Barcelona's 2-0 first leg win last week

Despite the pressure that comes with the expectations,
Hart refuses to be overwhelmed heading into the business end of the season
that will culminate at the World Cup in Brazil this summer.

'I don’t really get nervous during a game,' he said.

'I think with the build-up we have now, we’ve had some big
games recently with a lot of build-up, the whole country’s been talking about
it so you can’t help but get a feeling.'

City famously beat Manchester United to the title in 2012
when Sergio Aguero scored a 96th minute winner against QPR at the Etihad.

Hart to Hart: The England keeper handed over a signed shirt to Hollywood film star Kevin Hart after his visit to City's training ground on Wednesday

Should it go down to the wire again this year, Hart insists
he's ready to grab the glory himself.

He told the young fans: 'I'd love to have a run outfield...
but I'm not quite as fit as the others are.

'I could have a five minute burst and cause a bit of
trouble!'

The last time City tried that, David James failed to create any impact when Stuart Pearce threw the towering goalkeeper up front with minutes to go in their end of season 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough in 2005, where they narrowly missed out on Europe as a result.

But perhaps we might see a late cameo from Hart this Sunday if the Capital
One Cup Final delivers a dramatic climax...

Happy days: Hart admits he would love a five minute run on field... especially if it could help City emulate their dramatic 2012 final day of the season Premier League title triumph
