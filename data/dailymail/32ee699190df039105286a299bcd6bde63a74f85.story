If you're planning on flying somewhere for Thanksgiving, expect planes and airports to be even busier than usual this year.

Airports could be much more crowded this year as more people fly to their destination to spend time with their family.

U.S. airlines expect to carry 24.6 million passengers over the 12 days surrounding Thanksgiving, up 1.5 percent from last year.

Busy: Travelers move through the security line on Thanksgiving at the Denver International Airport, there are predictions that there could be widespread disruption this year too

Holiday: Travelers make their way through the Salt Lake City international Airport - U.S. airlines expect to carry 24.6 million passengers over the 12 days surrounding Thanksgiving

And the worst day to travel could be on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, which falls on November 30, with 2.6 million people flying on U.S. airlines.

The forecast comes from Airlines for America, a trade group representing the biggest U.S. carriers.

It looked at data for Friday, November 21 to Tuesday, December 2 and found that there could be more problems this year compared with prior Thanksgiving.

John Heimlich, the group's chief economist, said that rising personal incomes and job growth are helping boost demand for travel.

However, last year, the airlines' Thanksgiving travel forecast turned out to be too high by about 3 percent. Heimlich blamed bad weather for causing widespread flight cancelations.

Last year, a winter storm caused Thanksgiving travel chaos  in Texas.

Road block: Air travel is expected to be bad, but it may not be any better for those who drive 

More than 300 flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport - one of the busiest hubs in the nation - were canceled as a dangerous mix of freezing rain and sleet threatened north Texas.  

However, even if airlines meet this year's forecast, Thanksgiving travel would still be about 6 per cent lower than it was before the recession that began in 2008.

The airlines are doing well financially by limiting the supply of new seats and raising fares.

In the first nine months of this year, the nine biggest U.S. airlines reported earnings of $6.8 billion, up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

Yet  airfares rose 4.7 percent this summer from the same months last summer, after adjusting for inflation.
