The NHS has written a song to teach children not to go to A&E unless it is a real emergency.

Schools are being urged to teach the lyrics as part of a campaign fronted by a knitted monkey to ease the pressure on casualty departments.

One million more people visited A&E last year compared to 3 years ago, and officials claim that if one child from every school wen to their GP instead they it would save £1.4million.

The toy Monkey is being used by the NHS to educated children about what it is like to go to hospital, and the alternatives when it is not a real emergency

A kit has been sent to every primary school in England to help teach children about the structure of the health service.

The NHS hopes youngsters will succeed where politicians and doctors have failed, and persuade their parents to consider alternatives to rushing to A&E.

It follows successful campaigns on recycling and road safety, where adults came under pressure to change their behaviour after being nagged by their children.

The ‘Monkey Wellbeing’ has been produced for the NHS by primary school teacher Helen Sadler.

It includes puppets, DVDs, posters, stories, stickers and a song to educate children about different NHS services.

Children who remember the difference between a walk-in centre and a pharmacy are given an NHS Explorer badge.

A series of slides presents different health scenarios and asks children to consider whether they would need to go to A&E

It is claimed that if one child from every primary school does not go to A&E as a result of the packs, it would save the NHS £1.4million

An evaluation of the packs produced earlier this year shows that the song in particular has proved a hit with pupils.

The lyrics include: ‘When Monkey’s feeling poorly or gets an injury / He doesn’t have to swing straight to A and E / There are lots of friendly people in the NHS / So here’s a Monkey song to help you choose what’s best.’

There are also slides which show the Monkey with different ailments, and the children have to decide where best to seek treatment.

It includes having a headache, being bullied, feeling sick and having a crayon stuck up his nose.

Organisers of the scheme claim : ‘If the pack can prevent one child from each of the 19,088 Primary Schools in England from visiting an Emergency Department unnecessarily then the NHS could save £1.4 million.’

Reducing the number of people who turn up at A&E with non-emergencies has become a major political issue.

David Cameron and Ed Miliband have repeatedly clashed in the Commons on waiting times to be seen.

The Prime Minister said last week: ‘Of course more people are going to A and E departments in our country—over a million more people—but we are meeting our targets,and waiting times are down by a half.’

However, patient groups are unimpressed by the attempt to use children to cojole their parents into using different NHS services.

Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, told The Times: 'Don’t try to put children in charge of when it is necessary to use public services like A&E.'

When Monkey’s feeling poorly or gets an injury, He doesn’t have to swing straight to A and E

There are lots of friendly people in the NHS, So here’s a Monkey song to help you choose what’s best

CHORUS

Try a.... Grown up, pharmacist, helpline, GP, School Nurse, ChildLine, out of hours surgery

On-line, walk in, 999, A&E, Monkey, here to help you through

Monkey, knows just what to do, Monkey, always there for you Monkey

 

If you’ve got the sniffles or a little scrape, Don’t go bananas and don’t go ape

Talk to a grown-up or your school nurse, They’ll help you out so it doesn’t get worse 

If you’re monkey puzzled and still feel unwell, You can give the helpline a little bell

They’ll listen hard to what you have to say, Or look online at NHS.uk

CHORUS 

 

Monkey sometimes goes to see the jungle GP, He knows little Monkey and his family

But out of office hours, if Monkey’s sick up in his tree, Go to the walk in centre or out of hours GP

If someone has an accident or is really really sick, Don’t monkey around - you need to act quick

If you need an ambulance, move quick call 999, Or go to A&E and you’ll be seen on time!

CHORUS

 

Monkey tries to stay healthy, he eats his 5 a day, 

His paws are clean, he’s really keen to keep the germs away

He like swinging in the trees, oh it’s great to run and play, 

An apple - or banana – help to keep the Doc away

 

So be happy and be active and you’ll stay very well, 

But sometimes we’re all poorly and we feel unwell

There are lots of friendly people in the NHS, 

But staying fit and healthy is what everyone likes best!
