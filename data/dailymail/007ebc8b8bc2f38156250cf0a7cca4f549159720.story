Newspaper bosses last night announced plans to mount an extraordinary legal challenge to plans to impose on the Press a Royal Charter written by politicians.

They are to argue that the Government’s handling of a rival Royal Charter proposed by the newspaper and magazine industry was unlawful.

Industry bodies – through the Press Standards Board of Finance, which funds the existing regulatory system – are to apply to the High Court for judicial review.

They will argue a decision by the Privy Council, a secretive body of ministers which advises the Queen, to reject an industry-backed charter in favour of one agreed behind closed doors by the three main political parties, should be quashed.

Earlier this month, politicians agreed the detail of their own charter designed to oversee newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards.

An alternative proposal put forward by the Press, which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million for wrongdoing, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected.

Planning minister Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the Government has handled the issue

It is thought to be the first time the Queen has been asked to sign a Royal Charter imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry.

One close ally of the Prime Minister, planning minister Nick Boles, suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the Government has handled the issue.

The Spectator magazine has already 
announced it will refuse to take part in regulation overseen by the 
politicians’ charter and take its chances in the courts.

The
Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse 
to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages and 
punitive costs in libel and privacy cases.

However,
senior figures including Lord Lester, an eminent QC who is the 
architect of reforms to the libel laws, have suggested that would 
violate article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which 
protects freedom of expression.

This week, an international coalition of free speech groups warned that the ‘repressive’ plans to regulate Britain’s 300-year-old free press will undermine the country’s international standing and the reputation of the Queen.

The warning was signed by the World Press Freedom Committee, the International Press Institute and the Commonwealth Press Union among others.

Lord Black of Brentwood, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, said: ‘The decision by the Government and the Privy Council on this matter has enormous ramifications for free speech both here in the UK, and – because of our leadership role in the Commonwealth and developing world – across the globe.

‘The Government and the Privy Council 
should have applied the most rigorous standards of consultation and 
examination of the Royal Charter proposed by the industry, which would 
have enshrined tough regulatory standards at the same time as protecting
Press freedom.

‘They singularly failed to do so, and that is why – as the issues at stake are so extraordinarily high – we are having to take this course of action.’ 

The Mayor of London Boris Johnson backed the move by the newspapers. He told the Mail: ‘The state has no business trying to regulate the content of newspapers. In America they wouldn’t dream of doing it, so why do it here?

‘A free press is the bedrock of democracy and any Royal Charter needs to be fully and properly consulted on – anything less risks  outcomes that threaten those freedoms.’

The industry will argue that despite repeated requests, the Privy Council refused to discuss what criteria they used to judge its charter until after it had decided to reject it.

It claims that the application was not dealt with fairly, that the press had a right to be consulted which the Government and the Privy Council failed to do, and that the procedures deployed were ‘irrational’.

In a separate announcement, industry representatives announced a final set of plans to set up a new Independent Press Standards Organisation.

Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry group which has drawn up the plans and executive director of Trinity Mirror plc, said after nine months of work and consultation a ‘tough, independent and effective regulator’ was in sight.
