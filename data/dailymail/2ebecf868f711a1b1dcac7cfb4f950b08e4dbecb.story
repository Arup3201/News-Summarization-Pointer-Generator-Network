Tommy Caldwell's free climb up the sheer face of El Capitan in California makes him one of the world's bravest men.

He's now revealed that his courage and drive in life partly comes from a terrifying kidnap ordeal at the hands of murderous Islamists, which only ended when he pushed one of his captors off a cliff.

Caldwell has told how after this 'pain and suffering paled in comparison'.

Tommy Caldwell's free climb up the sheer face of El Capitan in California makes him one of the world's bravest men - and he's now revealed that his drive partly comes from a terrifying kidnap ordeal 

The horrifying drama took place in 2000 while he was attempting to scale a sheer face in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan with three other climbers, including his then-girlfriend, Beth Rodden.

While they were resting in a tent attached half-way up the rock-face, four terrorists from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group linked to Al Qaeda, began spraying them with bullets.

Fearing that they were just seconds from being killed, they abseiled down to the ground.

Six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place, with little food or water.

Kyrgyz army helicopters hunted the terrorists, who told the group, which included climbers Jason Smith and John Dickey, that they would be shot if they didn't hide from them.

Eventually, the group saw a chance to escape when just one terrorist was left in charge of them.

They knew that they could die in the sub-zero temperatures and that drastic action had to be taken.

Caldwell described how he grabbed the terrorist's gun as they crossed a narrow ridge and shoved him off.

Their captor bounced off a ledge below and disappeared into the darkness.

Caldwell was immediately wracked with guilt.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'I totally panicked. I thought I was an evil person. I said to Beth, 'How can you love me after I did something like this?'

'I was, like, "What is inside me that allowed me to do this?". And I was basically curled up in a ball. I had totally broken down. And they were trying to comfort me. They were saying how I'd just saved their lives. It was helping, but I still couldn't believe that I had just done that.'

The experience, however, changed his perspective on life permanently.

He added: 'I was pretty sure I was going to die. I'm so glad to be alive. I have to embrace every day of my life. After than incident, any pain and suffering paled in comparison.' 

And his anguish over his attack on the guard subsided when he learned that he'd survived the fall. 

Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, both from the US, completed the ascent of El Capitan, one of California's most iconic features, on Wednesday. It was a feat deemed impossible by many.

They called their 19-day taming of the sheer 900-meter (2,950-feet) rock face in Yosemite National Park a 'spiritual experience.'

The two made the journey up the previously untraversed Dawn Wall, a sheer granite rock face on the massive formation considered one of the most difficult free climbs in the world.

'It felt like a very spiritual experience the whole time, even now it feels a bit surreal to me,' Caldwell told reporters following the climb. 

Jorgeson added: 'When you would grab that last hole you could literally feel all of the hope, desire and stress drop off of you.' 

Free climbing involves climbing with only the hands and feet. The only ropes are fixed from below as a safety precaution.

The two had trained for years and planned their climb months in advance, carefully studying their route up the Dawn Wall.

During the journey Caldwell and Jorgeson slept in small tents affixed to the rock face and climbed up the ropes to where they had left off for a new day of climbing.

'I think that the camaraderie that we had was crucial,' Caldwell said.

As the two neared the end of their journey, they attracted international attention for the incredible feat.

El Capitan rises more than 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor. The first climber reached its summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top

Dozens of news outlets covered the finale of the climb when Jorgeson and Caldwell were greeted by friends and sprayed with champagne.

US President Barack Obama tweeted words of congratulations with a photo of himself in front of a painting of the notable rock face.

'You remind us that anything is possible,' Obama wrote. 

The critical moment for Jorgeson came at the beginning of the month about half way up the free climb.

Their climbing was divided into sections or 'pitches' between which their safety ropes were strung.

On pitch 15, Jorgeson reached an impasse.

The taller climber needed to reach out with his full armspan, and hold with just two fingers of one hand to pull himself to the next hold and finish the pitch.

But his fingers, worn down after days of climbing in the cold winter nights, were cracked and cut and he couldn't reach the hold the slighter Caldwell had already completed.

Giving up crossed Jorgeson's mind, and he considered telling Caldwell to continue ahead without him.

'The idea of topping out without Kevin was something I didn't want to think about,' Caldwell told reporters.

Fortunately, the weather stayed cold and dry, best for climbing because of the friction, and Caldwell said they would stay as long as they needed until Jorgeson could make the spread-eagle move.

Jorgeson had the film crew following him splice together all his failures on pitch 15. He studied his mistakes, corrected his technique and made the difficult grab.

'Everything really had to come together for that to work out,' he said reflecting on the moment.

'You are just hanging there in silence and relief and joy and it's like the coolest feeling.'
