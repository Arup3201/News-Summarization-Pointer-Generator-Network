Watching your weight does not include eating large bowls of pasta. But if you thought such things were off the menu, you might want to think again.

Makers of the spiralizer — a new kitchen gadget that is taking America by storm — claim you can create nutritious, very low-calorie, low-carb ‘pasta’, ‘noodles’ and ‘rice’ from everyday fruit and vegetables, in less time than it takes to peel a spud.

According to U.S. food bloggers, this magic machine can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘spaghetti’ in a flash. Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘rice’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati.

Kitchen magic: The spiralizer turns fruit and vegetables into noodles  in less time than it takes to peel a spud

So, of course, I was keen to try it, not least because with two children — Stanley, 12, and Florence, seven — I’m always looking for ways to add fruit and vegetables to their diet without any dinner-table histrionics.

It seems that spiralizing still has some way to go before it catches on here, however. My local cookware shops in Surrey, and even the Lakeland website, drew a blank. I eventually found one — a Spiralite, by Spiralz — online, for £25 on Amazon, including free delivery.

Three days later the lightweight, dishwasher-proof machine arrived, with three confusing-looking interchangeable blades. But six simple step-by-step instructions later, I was ready to crank the handle.

To begin, I pressed the legs of the machine down firmly on a flat surface to allow the suction cups on to hold it in position.

Next, I had to choose what to spiralize. Firm fruit and vegetables work best, which means that berries, citrus fruits and avocados are out. Carrot, sweet potato and pear are all good choices but courgette is a favourite, as it creates such delicious ‘pasta’.

Oodles of noodles: Mandy's first attempt was courgette spaghetti

Simply impale your vegetable between the spiked disc and the slicing blade — pushing it forward with one hand while turning the handle at the back of the machine with the other — and you’ll be quickly rewarded with a neat tumble of veggie ‘spaghetti’. No chopping or coring is required.

My first recipe attempt, then, was courgette spaghetti, a favourite on websites because of its low calorie content — a 125g portion of raw courgette spaghetti contains 21 calories and less than 4g of carbohydrate, compared with 346 calories and 64g of carbohydrate for normal spaghetti.

One large peeled courgette, put through the spiralizer, makes enough for one person. After blanching the spirals for a minute or two in boiling water — you can salt them if you wish — I drained them and plopped on a generous dollop of our family’s home-made bolognese sauce.

My children were nodding eagerly until, roughly five minutes after serving, their meals began to bleed. Courgettes, it seems, have an exceptionally high water content of roughly 95 per cent, and once they were sitting on a plate that moisture was released, turning dinner into more of a bolognese soup.

Undeterred, my next challenge was a spiralized ‘noodle’ stir-fry — one large carrot, a medium courgette and half an onion per person, spiralized and stir-fried with four beaten eggs and a splash of soy sauce to make four 150-calorie meals.

Although hungry, the children were now sceptical. But Florence was first to pronounce it a success: ‘Mum, this is gor-geous,’ she cooed, before they both cleared their plates.

Just like the real thing? Dieticians says that carbs should not be competely cut from our diets

The next day I was practically aglow with ideas. I began with breakfast: ribbons of pear with a blob of Greek yoghurt, a sprinkle of walnuts and a dash of honey — around 170 calories in total.

For lunch I tried something lighter — a raw salad of half a beetroot with a large raw carrot, half a courgette and half a cucumber ‘noodles’. In just under 15 minutes I had whizzed them through the blade, leaving the two beetroot until last as — be wary — they spatter slightly. I splashed on some balsamic dressing and it tasted fresh and zingy — and all with just 140 calories.

Florence and Stanley now demanded spiralized suppers. Their favourite treat is curly fries, so I tried to make them with sweet potato.

Leaving the potatoes unpeeled for extra fibre, one medium potato made enough for one person. I splashed the freshly made coils with olive oil and baked them in a hot oven for about 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the finer edges of the springs burnt too quickly while the coiled parts remained underdone. Another disaster.

Next I found the recipe for sweet potato ‘rice’, which requires chopping the spiralized potatoes in a food processor until they resemble rice grains.

I fried a few cloves of chopped garlic and half an onion before adding my sweet potato rice and poaching it in chicken stock for two minutes.

A quick sieve and I had an orange-coloured ‘risotto’. It tasted delicious.

Best of all, it contained only 107 calories and 25g of carbohydrates per portion (compared with 183 calories and 37.5g carbs in basmati).

But is it really prudent to remove significant amounts of carbs from a family’s diet?

Dietitian Vanessa Hattersley says: ‘It’s definitely not a good idea to eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely, as they are a food group that provides us with a range of important nutrients.

‘That said, many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta, rice, bread and potatoes when they are on offer. A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein, a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables, so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet.’

There is very little room in the back of my cupboards for yet another faddy gadget to gather dust. But I think this little gizmo may just have earned a permanent place on my kitchen counter.
