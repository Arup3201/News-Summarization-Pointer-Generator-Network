Bravo hit Southern Charm has introduced a new cast member this season, after quietly firing original cast member Jenna King at the end of Season One.

Landon Clements is introduced in Season Two, which began airing last week, as an old friend of Shep’s who has moved back to Charleston in the wake of her divorce from an unnamed British man who she lived with  in Los Angeles.

And Dailymail.com can reveal that not only is her ex-husband James Maby also the ex-husband of Clueless actress Stacey Dash, he was also once the star of a reality show.

Landon, 33, was born Ansley Landon Clements in Georgia. After going to the College of Charleston (during which time she met Southern Charm castmate Shep Rose) she moved to Telluride, Colorado to ski and met James Maby when she was 24.

Landon claims she was swept off her feet by a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ After they met, they got married in Charleston and then she moved with him to Los Angeles. She never names him on the show or on the Bravo website, but she shared a few photos on the series' second episode

The pair were together for seven years, she told Southern Charm cameras, while photos showed snippets of their glamorous time together. 

But she said it was also terribly lonely, so lonely that she left him and California behind.

‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the [Hollywood] Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels. When I moved out of the house I pretty much just walked away from all of it…. 

'On the inside I was so alone, so I packed up and left. Sometimes you just have to save yourself,' she told the camera as she choked back tears.

No more bling: ‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the  Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels,' Landon said on Southern Charm. She shared this photo of an impressive looking engagement ring, right

Maby's first wife Stacey Dash, seen left in 1995's Clueless, had a sizable looking diamond ring herself in 2005, at right, which was around the time she married to Maby after giving birth to their daughter

Maby, 43, is an Etonian who claims to speak five languages and was married to Stacey Dash from 2005 to 2006. 

The pair share a daughter Lola, 11, together. He is the CEO of Sports Logistics, an international firm which does sport branding and billboards and travels a lot for his job.

From Landon’s bio on the Bravo website it would seem there isn't a lot of love lost between the pair, as she branded him in part an 'international man of not much mystery.' 

An excerpt reads:

‘During this time she met a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ The international man of not much mystery swept her off her feet and they married in Charleston. The demands of their careers compounded with the duties for his actress ex-wife and young daughter became too much for the pair and they separated.’

The bio never names him or Dash. 

But then she choked up while telling the cameras about her live with James Maby. Despite the sunny Los Angeles weather, Landon says her life was incredibly lonely 

Maby's life in Los Angeles also includes daughter Lola, 11, whom he had with ex-wife Stacey Dash. One time Clueless star Dash, who has been married three times, also has son Austin, 23, pictured at right with his mom and sister

After Landon and James pair split in 2013, Landon spent the winter in Aspen and arrived back in Charleston to ‘reclaim her life’ in 2014 – coincidentally just in time to join the Bravo show which filmed last summer.

But Landon doesn't just have friends on reality shows already. Lke Shep, she has an ex-husband with plenty of experience himself, and she no doubt knew more than most what she would be getting into by joining the Bravo hit.

Her ex-husband James Maby was a repeat winner on the largely forgotten British reality show Lost, which aired for just one season the fall of 2001.

On Lost two strangers were paired together, given almost no money and just three days' rations, and were parachuted while blind folded into an unknown destination - including Azerbaijan and Mali.

All they knew was their final destination, and they had to find there way to it.

On the show Maby and his teammate, an until-the-show stranger named Harriet Bulwer-Long, were dropped alongside two other teams in an unknown destination with little food or money. Here they take their blindfolds off upon being left in Newfoundland

He worked his posh accent and knowledge of languages to his advantage. His team also had the benefit of his family apartment on Fifth Avenue, where they stayed one night while passing through New York with no money, seen right. That apartment was sold in 2004, before he met Landon

One episode saw James negotiating the price of his camel ride to Timbuktu, seen here, before complaining that the saddle hurt his privates

Maby was also rampant flirt and a charmer during his time on the show, smiling when the women here answered that he was

He won multiple times, and celebrated each time with the classic champagne pop and crowd spray upon reaching Trafalgar Square

Each race contained three teams, and each team had a cameraman in tow. On all but the season finale the teams were competing to be first back to London's Trafalgar Square.

They had to beg and borrow and talk their way into freebies - including plane tickets - to survive.

Maby, who skis and claims to speak five languages, thrived. 

The first team back to Trafalgar Square won, and got to go on the adventure again. Maby won multiple rounds and featured prominently throughout the season.

Cameras followed as he and show partner Harriet Bulwer-Long traversed on camel back to Timbuktu, found his way out of Newfoundland, and borrowed money off old school friends in New York where his father conveniently had an apartment on Fifth Avenue. 

As a repeat winner he had a large amount of screen time, but he receded from the spotlight when the show went off the air.

No doubt he would have good advice for his ex on how to win over viewers on reality television if the pair still speak.

But it's unclear if they are on speaking terms, and Maby appears to have bounced right back from his second divorce and into a new relationship. 

As of August 2013 his Facebook status has been ‘in a relationship’ with Kam Heskin, 41, a sometime actress and publicist for jewelry companies.

 Maby seems to have moved on from Landon with no problem. In August 2013 Kam Heskin proclaimed them 'in a relationship' when she posted these two photos
