This is the moment a musically-talented dog unleashes his vocal skills to the world.

A video uploaded by YouTube user RighInTwo shows Coyote the canine singing in near-perfect pitch to a saxophone accompaniment.

As the song Basie's Blues by American jazz saxophonist Jim Snidero sounds, the animal tunefully howls along.

In a bid to hit the right notes, he tilts his head back with his ears pinned back and nose in the air.

Apparently the pet is singing in B flat and one viewer who watched him says he also hits a D flat and D natural.

The performance appears to take place in a music room, with Coyote coolly lying down by a dismantled drum kit.   

Someone in the background is heard giggling away as they watch the novel performance take place. 

It is not known where the crooning dog resides or who his owner is.
