The water system on a Scottish island has shut down and a branch of Tesco has completely run out of ice thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge. 

Demand for water escalated on Colonsay when the charity craze took off on the Inner Hebridean island, which has a population of around 135.

Meanwhile a branch of Tesco in Simonside, South Shields, admitted running out of ice with fundraisers rushing to buy bags of it to take part in the challenge.

The Tesco in Simonside, South Shields (pictured) ran out of ice on Saturday amid a rush of fundraising 

In Colonsay, the water system stops automatically as part of moves to cut wastage on the eight mile-long isle and needs to be turned back on afterwards.

David Johnston, from the Colonsay Brewery told The Sun that water engineers had to come out five times over the weekend.

The 60-year-old told the newspaper: 'The challenge spread round the island like wildfire. It hit a peak on Sunday evening. 

'The water system must have thought there was a burst main.'

Engineers were called out five times on one weekend after the water system shut off with large numbers of islanders taking on the Ice Bucket Challenge (file picture of someone taking on the charity challenge)

A spokesman for Scottish Water said water had been shut off during the weekend but added that residents were still able to use stored supplies on the island.

Staff at a Tesco in Simonside, South Shields, admitted selling out of ice on Saturday.  

Daniel Smith, duty manager of Tesco, said: 'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well.

'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on.

'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too.

'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.'

The Ice Bucket Challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go.

In Britain, people take part in the challenge to support the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 

The craze has gone viral on social media websites in the last two months.
