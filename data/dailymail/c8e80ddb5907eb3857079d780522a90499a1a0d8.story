James DeGale almost knocked Marco Antonio Periban through the ropes - then branded Carl Froch a coward for not fighting him.

DeGale risked his status as mandatory challenger to Froch's IBF title by taking on the tough Mexican, a previous world title challenger.

But he needed just six minutes and 30 seconds to stop the visitor, landing a heavy left hook that left Periban sprawled on the canvas.

DeGale said: 'He's never been stopped, Sakio Bika couldn't stop him and I was only getting warmed up. That left hand is my shot at the moment. I hit him and he was stumbling around, he wasn’t in a position to carry on.

'I'll come out and watch George Groves but don't worry about him, I am the mandatory for the IBF title - I want to make history.

'I like Carl but it feels like he doesn't want to fight me, I respect him but I think he's being a bit of a coward not fighting me - fight me or vacate the title.'

Froch responded: 'It was a great performance by James, he was landing a lot of big shots and switching and he did the job with what was in front of him.

'Boxing is a business, I have a promoter and if the fight makes financial sense, it will happen. I want to fight in Las Vegas and if anyone has the right to pick and choose where they fight, it's me.'

DeGale has long been frustrated in his efforts to secure a fight at the highest level as he bids to become the first Olympic champion from Britain to win a professional world title.

Froch has until New Year's Eve to decide whether to face his younger rival or relinquish his title.

DeGale is likely to get a title shot in 2015 regardless of whether Froch vacates his title or not

Either way, DeGale should finally get his chance early next year. Victory in that fight could also set him up for a mouthwatering rematch with long-time rival Groves.

The pair have been bitter enemies since their amateur days and Groves outpointed DeGale in 2011. They also clashed backstage on Friday after weighing in for their respective fights.

Periban, meanwhile, was a pound over the limit after his second attempt to make weight and was much the bigger man in the ring.

The 30 year old lost his challenge for Sakio Bika's WBC belt last year and was without a win in his last three contests.

And he was on the back foot from the first bell as DeGale dominated the exchanges with the cleaner, crisper work.

Then, in the third round, a left hook sent Periban to the deck and referee Howard Foster immediately waved it off despite the floored man's protests.
