A Florida woman gave birth to an astonishingly large baby on Friday.

Nicia McNelley birthed Isiah Lawrence Johnson at UF Health Shands Hospital at 11:23 a.m. He weighed 14 pounds 7.6 ounces and measured 22.5 inches.

Gainesville.com reports that this is one of the largest babies ever born at UF Shands Hospital. This is the third child for Nicia and she says she wont be having another baby anytime soon. Quinta Johnson is the baby's father but the pair are not married.

'It seems like it took them forever to get him out,' said McNelley, 30, from the labor and delivery unit at Shands on Friday.

The birth was a cesarean section 7 days 
before the child was due was due on Dec.27. An early due date is 
somewhat of a blessing as Isiah will be able to celebrate his first 
Christmas in Keystone Heights with his family this year.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that shortly after Isiah was delivered, he began breastfeeding when all of a sudden he turned blue and started shaking.

Isiah was rushed over to NICU and given an IV and oxygen to help bring his blood sugar up. His mother didn't even get to hold her son until two days after he was born.

Just in time for Christmas: Isiah was a cesarian section born seven days before he was due on December 27

Her facebook page read, 'All i can do is sit here and cry. I hate [that] my son is away from me. I see moms here who have their babies in their rooms and it upsets me,' McNelley wrote on her Facebook page.

Nicia was reunited with her big bundle of joy on Sunday and his condition is improving.

His mother told the Orlando Sentinel that he may be diabetic later in life, but for now he's been taken off of oxygen.

'He’s been our strong boy in holding on and fighting. I really didn’t think he would do this well but he’s proven me wrong, he’s made me a proud momma for sure.'

The Mail Online spoke with a hospital representative who said that while Nicia and her baby were supposed to be released today, they will be released tomorrow just in time for Christmas

14 pounds is certainly a lot of weight for a baby, but nothing tops the Guinness World Record's biggest birth of 22 pounds 8 oz. in South Africa. Christina Samane gave birth to the large child with Weaver's Syndrome, a disease that causes excessive growth in children due to genetic abnormalities.

Evidencebasedbirth.com reports that having an abnormally large baby may be linked to a mother's high blood sugar if not a genetic disorder. Around 1 in 10 women in the U.S. will have  a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds.

Nicia McNelley is a 'proud momma' and is looking forward to taking her son home tomorrow
