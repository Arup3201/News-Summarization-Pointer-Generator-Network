Fans of box office hit Gone Girl will be delighted to hear author Gillian Flynn has said she is open to making a sequel of the psychological thriller.

Flynn, who wrote the book and then produced the screenplay, says she would only revisit the plot if Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were happy to reprise their roles. 

Flynn, who was nominated for best screenplay for the film, told the New York Daily News: 'There could be a sequel at some point if everyone is game to get the gang back together, it could be really fun a few years from now.

'We could pick it up and see what those crazy Dunnes are up to a few years down the road and if they got on — not well I don't think.

'I would have to have the exact same people to do it — I would want Rosamund, Ben and Fincher to do it.'

The 43-year-old also admitted that it was Ben Affleck's choice to show as much as he did in the shower scene at the end of the film as she did not specify it in her screenplay.

'I was all for the cinema realite. He was a total method actor and in playing a man who got in the shower, he played a man who got in the shower.

'I didn't know exactly how they would film it. I think the screenplay says they get in the shower so I cannot take credit for that.'

The film had four nominations at the Golden Globes - and became director David Fincher’s highest-grossing film in the U.S  - it took $365,322,000 at the box office worldwide. 

The author behind the psychological thriller of the summer, Gone Girl, has said her book about a marriage turning sour was inspired by her own successful marriage, and that her lawyer husband was, in fact, her 'muse'.

The pop culture journalist-turned-horror author, said Gone Girl is so intensely creepy ('my goal is to make spouses look askance at each other') thanks entirely to partner Brett Nolan giving her licence to write anything she liked.

Speaking to Oliver Burkeman in the Guardian, Flynn, said she wrote the book - which has now sold millions of copies worldwide - when the couple, who have a young son, were very newly married

She said: 'The funny thing, I guess is that my husband ended up being the muse of a book about the worst marriage in the world, because if he hadn't consistently said, 'Don't censor yourself, don't worry about me' - if he'd been anxious and worried about it - then it would never have gotten written.'

Gone Girl - which follows Flynn's first books Sharp Objects (2007) and Dark Places (2010) - tells the story of a marriage gone horribly wrong, and questions whether you can ever truly know the person with whom you share your life.

Set in Missouri, on the fifth wedding anniversary of 'perfect' couple Nick and Amy Dunne, the novel begins when Nick comes home to find his beautiful, trust-fund wife missing from their home amid and evidence of a struggle.

Enter the police, the media, and Amy's overbearing parents - along with some revealing entries from the missing woman's diary - and Nick finds he must defend himself against accusations.

Fynn, who grew up obsessed with horror films as a child in Kansas ('I watched Psycho a million times') and trained as a crime reporter, says people who have read her books expect her to be a sociopath, but that mystery writers actually tend to be the 'sanest and nicest people'.

The former pop culture writer, who was fired from her job at Entertainment Weekly in 2009 due to budget cuts, added: 'It seems like the darker the books are, the nicer the person is. People say it's the romance writers you've got to watch out for.' 

While Gone Girl has been accused of misogyny (female characters in her writing are seldom very palatable), Flynn insists she is a feminist... just one who is wants to push against the idea that women are intrinsically loving and kind.

She is 'weary of spunky heroines'. She wants to make her ladies ugly.

She said: 'In literature they can be bad - trampy, vampy, bitchy types - but there's still a big pushback against the idea that women can be just pragmatically evil, bad and selfish.'
