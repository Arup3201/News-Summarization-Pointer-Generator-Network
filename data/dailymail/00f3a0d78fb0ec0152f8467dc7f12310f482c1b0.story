A US embassy official in South Africa was allegedly stabbed to death by a 29-year-old woman in the early hours of yesterday morning.

The embassy today confirmed the death of Christopher 'Norm' Bates, information management officer at the Johannesburg consulate.

The 41-year-old was found with knife wounds to his upper body at a flat in Johannesburg, after the pair reportedly arrived there by car at 3am.

Shock: The US Consulate in Sandton, Johannesburg, close to the flat where the murdered American was found

A guard said he went to investigate after hearing a woman's scream and found the stabbed man and the woman holding a knife.

Mr Bates, who had worked for the state for 11 years, died at the suburban flat before police arrived and a South African woman was arrested.

She is due to appear at Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court tomorrow, according to Gauteng police's Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini.

Mr Bates's cousin Jackie Pinkney, who lives on the East Coast, said: 'This is very devastating for the family. His brother lives with him there and will be bringing his body home this week.

'He was a one-of-a-kind man.'

Police seized a knife believed to be the murder weapon.

Lt Col Dlamini said he could not elaborate on the type of knife used in the fatal stabbing.

Aghast: The IT worker was found by a guard who heard screaming in the early hours of the morning

'We don’t know the reason for the 
murder,' he said. 'When [the guard] went to investigate he saw that [the
woman] had a knife in her hand.

'I do not know how many times he was stabbed. That will be revealed after a post-mortem.'

US embassy spokesman Jack Hillmeyer confirmed the death of the American Consulates IT department employee.

'He worked at our US consulate in Johannesburg,' he said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
