A Colombian artist is suing Dolce & Gabbana after claiming they stole her idea when they created what was billed as the world's swankiest headphones.

Colombian artist Adriana Duque, 46, said she was shocked when she spotted pictures of the Dolce & Gabbana headphones being advertised on the side of a taxi.

The headphones had caused a sensation when they were unveiled during the fashion house's recent autumn/winter 2015 show during Milan Fashion Week.

Adriana Duque says her 2011 photographs (one of which is pictured above) featuring jewel-encrusted headphones were the inspiration for Dolce & Gabbana's catwalk pieces

They are being sold for around £4,600, with the company saying they wanted to take music to the next level.

The headphones worn by the models are made of leather and are fully covered in the brand’s signature jewellery, embellished with materials like pearls, gold chains, Swarovski crystals and velvet across the earpieces and bridge.

The headphones were supposed to be just for the catwalk, but were so popular they are now available after the Dolce & Gabbana collaborated with Tech brand Frends.

Frends confirmed that two of the original catwalk versions have officially landed on American online retailer Moda Operandi and are ready to pre-order for expected delivery between July and October.

Since Frends was founded in 2006 by a young group of pro-snowboarders, the brand's minimalist designs have become a favourite in the fashion world.

Now by collaborating with the king of bling, the company has taken it's fashion designs to a whole new level.

But the artist, from the Colombian capital Bogota, claims that the designs are clearly based on a series of photographs entitled 'Icons' and 'Icons II' that she had taken, where kids and women are pictured wearing headphones made with precious stones.

She said: 'I looked at the designs that were on display on the catwalk and realised they were uncannily similar to my own from the pictures I took in 2011.'

According to the artist’s lawyer, in an interview with the newspaper El Tiempo, the work of Duque inspired Dolce & Gabanna, and the firm is  guilty of copyright theft.

Duque said: 'It is one thing to be inspired by the work of others, but it is another thing to simply copy someone else's work and then not to admit it because this is plagiarism and cannot be accepted.'

Dolce and Gabbana declined to comment about the issue.

It is has been a busy week for the fashion brand after one of its designers, Domenico Dolce, attracted worldwide criticism after saying babies born through IVF were 'synthetic'.
