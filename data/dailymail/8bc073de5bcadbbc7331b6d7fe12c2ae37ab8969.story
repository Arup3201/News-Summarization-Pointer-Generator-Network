A mum-of-two who lost her iPhone in a British pub was stunned when it turned up 6,000 miles away - in China.

Clare Kerrigan had given up hope of finding her missing iPhone 5c after it disappeared in a pub in Coventry, West Midlands, in August.

But the 38-year-old received an email from Apple on Monday saying the phone had been traced to a nursery in China.

Clare Kerrigan was shocked to discover her missing iPhone 5c has been traced to a city in China

The message informed her the iPhone was in the city of Shenzhen in the Guangdong region - 5,975 miles away from her home in Coventry.

Ms Kerrigan said when her phone had first gone missing she used the Find My iPhone app, but it could not locate the phone as it was switched off.

She bought a new phone and forgot about the incident until she received the email from Apple on Monday saying it had been located.

Incredibly, using the Find My iPhone app Ms Kerrigan is now able to see where it goes and even if the new owner is playing music. It was first located at the Futiancun Kindergarten in the south of the city.

Ms Kerrigan  believes her iPhone was shipped to Asia to be sold on the black market.

The mum-of-two, who lives with her daughter Elizabeth, six, and three-year-old son Michael, said:'I had a night out with friends and we got several taxis and ended up at The Cedars pub in Coundon and walked down the road.

'I either left it on the wall of the pub or in a taxi. It was a 5C so it was a bit slippy. I had only had it a couple of weeks so it didn't have many photos or much stuff on it.

'I came home and fell into bed and the next day I had a look around the house and realised it was gone.

'I phoned the pub and taxi companies and local polie and they all drew a blank.

'I spoke to O2 and got it cancelled and on the Find My iPhone app it was switched off so I couldn't see it.

'Then I got a new handset and I didn't really think about it again until Monday night when an email popped up saying it had been found.

'When it came up with Shenzhen in China I couldn't believe it.' 

Apple informed Ms Kerrigan on Monday that the iPhone is in Shenzhen- 5,975 miles away from Coventry

The tracking app has since shown the iPhone moving around the city but Ms Kerrigan said she was reassured by Apple that it could not be reactivated.

She added: 'I spoke to Apple and the man said somebody has probably bought it online but the handset is useless because it is locked.

'He put my mind at rest and said there is no way it can be reactivated because I was worried about my personal details on there if it was.

Stolen phones are often shipped to China or Africa because Apple's high-tech software makes it almost impossible to reactivate a stolen handset in the UK

Using the Find my iPhone app Ms Kerrigan can press a button and make the phone bleep in China 

Smartphones are so expensive in Asia the black market is flourishing - with hundreds of stolen British gadgets shipped overseas in suitcases and fruit containers

'He seemed to think that it couldn't be unlocked so someone in China has my phone but can't use it.

'He laughed and said if it was him he would just watch it.

'It hasn't moved too far since Monday. If I press a button on the app then I can make the phone make a noise in China which is funny.'

'Now I've got another phone popping up 6,000 miles away. I can't believe it.  

'There's not much the police can do over here to get it back so I've got to accept its in the hands of the Chinese now.

Shenzhen is a major city in the south of Southern China’s Guangdong Province, situated immediately north of Hong Kong

'Visiting China might be on my bucket list but it's certainly not somewhere I've ever been to.'
