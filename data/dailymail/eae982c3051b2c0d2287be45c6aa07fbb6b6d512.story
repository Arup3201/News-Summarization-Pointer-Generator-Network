A businessman who crashed a 199mph Ferrari 458 Spider into a tree just four minutes into a test drive died instantly.

Keith Poynton, 59, lost control when took a corner too fast in the £200,000 supercar, coming off the road and smashing into a tree, an inquest heard.

There was 'no question' that he was breaking the 60mph speed limit at the time of the crash, a forensic collision investigator said, blaming driver error for the tragedy.

Mr Poynton's son Tom, 25, suffered serious leg fractures in the accident in Linton, Derbyshire, last April.

Tom, a cricket player for Derbyshire, had taken the car for a spin himself just moments before the crash.

The Ferrari was owned by Derbyshire County Cricket Club chairman Chris Grant, who had bought the car on the day of the accident.

PC Ian Phillips told Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner's Court yesterday that 'regardless of his experience', Mr Poynton would not have been able to 'sufficiently' reduce his speed before the crash on the evening of April 4.

The police officer said: 'In my view, the collision occurred as a result of an error on the part of the driver, who had driven the vehicle for no longer than four minutes and, regardless of his experience, he was unable to reduce his speed sufficiently for the bend.'

He added that it was not possible to estimate the speed of the car on impact, but the damage suggested it was travelling fast. The car boasts a 0-62mph acceleration time of less than 3.4 seconds.

The maximum speed at which the bend could be safely negotiated is 44mph, the officer added, but there was 'no question' the driver had been exceeding the 60mph speed limit.

Tom Poynton told the inquest: 'To find out the average speed has shocked me a little. I didn't expect it to be that high.

'I would never question that my dad would put me in danger.'

Mr Poynton, of Rosliston, south Derbyshire, was a director of Briggs of Burton, engineers to the brewing and distilling industries. 

Witness Alex Wilson saw the car travelling on Caldwell Road, and again when it came up behind him before the crash on the bend.

Detective Constable Darren Parkin told the inquest: 'He looked in his mirror and saw a flash of red.

'He saw the car pass very quickly, before hearing a crumpling sound.'

The front of the car was destroyed by the impact.

Assistant coroner Louise Pinder concluded that Mr Poynton's death was caused by the crash.

She said: 'He must have been travelling in excess of the maximum for that bend.

'There is simply no other explanation available as to why the vehicle could not negotiate the bend safely. He was, of course, aware that Tom was travelling alongside him, and that demonstrates to me that he made an error of judgement.'

A spokesman for the cricket club said the family now hoped to put the inquest behind them.
