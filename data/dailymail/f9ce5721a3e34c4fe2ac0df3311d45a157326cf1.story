The world's biggest collection of Jaguar model cars is being sold off by an ex-football club chairman who has spent a lifetime collecting them.

Ken Chapman, former boss of Swindon Town, built up a collection of more than 1,000 models of his favourite car but now has nowhere to keep them.

Mr Chapman, who lives in Lincolnshire, is moving to a smaller house and has decided it is time to let other collectors enjoy them.

In the 1950s a Dinky Toy craze hit the UK with childrern and adults wanting replicas of their favourite cars.

Most of the models were in a scale of approximately 1:48 (but ranged from 1:8 to 1:2000*), which blended in with O scale railway sets.

Larger models (Dinky Super Toys) were not scaled down, and started to come with more action features.

In 1954, the Dinky line was reorganized: cars were sold in individual boxes and a separate line of models were made abroad. Both English and French Dinky Toys were exported to the United States.

As a result of stiff competition and a change in the way children played English Dinky started to experience problems in the 1970s before closing and later becoming part of Matchbox International.

The collection covers contemporary to tinplate manufacturers including Dinky, Corgi, Matchbox, Autoart and some of the more unusual like Tekno, Solido, Nicky and Norevover.

They range in size and value, with some valued at £20 and the more expensive ones at several hundred pounds.

The 12 boxes of cars are being sold by John Morgan of Sheffield Auction Gallery on March 15.

They include rare 1950s models by Indian firm Nicky which bought the old Dinky toy moulds in the Sixties.

Said Mr Morgan: 'It's impossible to give an accurate estimate of what the collection will make but some of the cars are extremely rare.

'The Nicky cars are are quite poor quality compared to the Dinkys but because of their rarity they are worth more.

'The collection is extremely eclectic and in amassing such such a huge collection Mr Chapman has managed to come by some real gems prized by toy connoisseurs.'

'Mr Chapman's particular favourite is a model XK120.

'I have seen large collections of toy cars before but never such a massive collection of one single marque. We have high hopes for it at the auction.'
