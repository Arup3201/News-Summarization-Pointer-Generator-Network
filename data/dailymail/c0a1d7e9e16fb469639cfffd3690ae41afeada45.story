Intense: Diana Becirovic dumped Al Pacino, pictured on the Late Show with David Letterman, because she found his personality 'tiresome'

He may have built a career playing 
mobsters in movies such as The Godfather trilogy and Scarface but Al 
Pacino was once dumped by a lover for being too boring.

Serbian model Diana Becirovic said that she found the actor’s intense personality and ‘paranoia’ tiresome.

Miss Becirovic, dated Pacino during the making of The Godfather in 1972, when he was playing mobster Michael Corleone in the Francis Ford Coppolla film and aged in his early 30s.

'He was always so tense and paranoid,' she told a Serbian newspaper.

'I always thought my role was to make a man feel like a man and his role should be to make me feel like a woman.

'But I never felt that way with Al. It was boring.'

The former Playboy model had more choice words for the Oscar winning 72-year-old, who is currently filming a biopic of music producer Phil Spector for US cable network HBO.

'He started to give me orders and I didn’t want to listen to that,' she said.

'For example, if we were out he used to say, "Let’s go straight home." And I’d say, "You can go by yourself if you want".'

Miss Becirovic said that she finally dumped the star when she became tired of his “strong ego.”

“It’s a pity. Many fans see him like the Godfather, strong and heroic.

‘But I saw him as tense and worried all the time because of his strong ego”, she explained.
