Many rich motorists want to own a supercar simply as a status symbol - and few will ever get the chance to use one to its full potential.

But a Bugatti Veyron driver has achieved seven runs at astonishing speeds of up to 225mph on Arizona’s Interstate 8 public highway.

An amazing video shows the $1.7million vehicle - named ‘car of the decade’ by BBC’s Top Gear in 2010 - driven into the U.S. from Mexico.

Supercar: A Bugatti Veyron driver has achieved seven runs at astonishing speeds of up to 225mph on Arizona's Interstate 8 public highway

On course: The 26-gallon car was kept in its 'handling mode' rather than 'top speed mode' because of the uneven surface of the public road

The ‘Bugatti Veryon (sic) High Speed Runs x7’ video, which has attracted more than 60,000 YouTube views, explained how the feat was performed.

The car, which has a 26-gallon tank, was kept in its ‘handling’ rather than ‘top speed’ mode because of the public road's uneven surface, it said.

And because of its impressive fuel efficiency the car could be driven down to the Mexico border and back into southern Arizona without refuelling.

A police officer stopped the car in Arizona but there was no trouble because it was being driven within the limit at the time, the video said.

Caught on camera: It's unclear whether the driver had official permission to perform the high-speed runs on the straight roads in Arizona

Outstanding: The seven-gear transmission vehicle has a total of 1,001 horsepower and a torque of up to 1,250 Newton meters

It’s unclear whether the driver had 
official permission to perform the high-speed runs on the straight 
roads, which made for perfect conditions.

The car didn’t even reach its top speed of 253mph but the road was certainly not designed for a speed of 225mph, reported Business Insider.

The seven-gear transmission vehicle has a total of 1,001 horsepower and a torque of up to 1,250 Newton metres, according to the Bugatti website.

The Veyron - which can do 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds - can get to speeds that would literally lift it up, but it was designed to avoid this.
