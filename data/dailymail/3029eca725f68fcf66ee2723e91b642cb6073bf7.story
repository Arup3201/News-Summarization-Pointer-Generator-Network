A bride who was so upset about the way she looked in her wedding day photographs has now lost half her bodyweight as a result.

Vicky Jennings, 27, had to buy herself a size 20 dress for her wedding to partner Dom.

She attended regular fittings, every six to eight weeks, to ensure the dress would be perfect for the special day.

Slimming down: Vicky Jennings was shocked into losing weight after setting sight on her wedding photographs - she has now lost half of her body weight 

But just days before her wedding, the dress had to be let out a further two inches, leaving Vicky feeling extremely self-concious on her big day. 

She then looked at wedding photographs and decided enough was enough and set about getting fit.

Vicky, from Newton Abbott, Devon, joined a local Slimming World group and lost half a stone in the first week.

The image that spurred her on: Vicky had to have her dream wedding dress let out by 2in a few days before her wedding and then she looked at the photographs and decided enough was enough and set about getting fit

As she was: Vicky, pictured at her heaviest of 16st, has now slimmed down to 8st thanks to a healthy diet and exercise

Happy, at last: Vicky says losing the weight has changed her life completely and she can have fun with her children finally 

Now, one year on, Vicky has dropped from 16st to 8st - meaning she has lost more than half her body weight.

Speaking about the motivation she needed to lose the weight, she said: 'It was the week before my wedding, I went for a final dress fitting. There were about six to eight weeks between all of the fittings and up until that point it had fit fine.

'On the final fitting the zip just wouldn't do up, I had to have it taken out an inch either side, so two inches in total.

'The dress was a size 20, which annoyed me anyway - I did not believe that I was that size at all.

'When they had to let the dress out it was absolutely horrifying. I was mortified. It was the last thing I needed.

'At first I started scoffing to make myself feel better but then I put my foot down and decided it was time to lose weight.'

What a difference a year can make! Now, one year on, Vicky, pictured with her wedding dress, has dropped from 16st to 8st - meaning she has lost more than half her body weight

New lease on life: Speaking about the effects her diet has had on her life, Vicky said: 'My confidence has just rocketed since I lost the weight - it's unbelievable. I've got my life back'

Vicky piled on the weight eating up to five take-aways a week and drank up to five cans of cola a day.

She said: 'I was never really big as a child or anything. The weight piled on as I was with my now-husband.

'We just felt so comfortable that neither of us really thought about what we were eating - we didn't really care.

'The problem was that we didn't really cook at home. It just got to the point where we would rely on frozen meals and take-aways.

'We'd probably have five take-aways a week. My favourite were doner kebabs. I'd have one a week.

'I also lived on full-fat coke. I'd have four or five cans of it a day. I just didn't realise how bad for you it was.'

Changing figure: After looking at her wedding pictures she decided enough was enough and joined her local Slimming World, where she learned how to cook healthy, fat-free meals. Thanks to this, she has managed to shed half of her body weight

After looking at her wedding pictures she decided enough was enough and joined her local Slimming World, where she learned how to cook healthy, fat-free meals.

She now cooks with her husband and two children creating family favourites, such as pizza, but in a healthy way.

She added: 'My life has changed dramatically, I think even just doing the everyday things. I didn't realise how restricted my life had been beforehand.

'I used to hate going to the beach because I would always wear long sleeved T-shirts. Now I can go to the beach with the kids and we can all have a fantastic time.

'I also used to refuse to walk anywhere, I would get my husband to drop me off at the entrance to places before he'd go and park the car. I didn't even realise I was doing it. But now I walk everywhere and the kids join in with me - it's great.

'My confidence has just rocketed since I lost the weight - it's unbelievable. I've got my life back.'
