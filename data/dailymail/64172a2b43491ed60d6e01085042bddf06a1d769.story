It was a scandal that shocked Britain... unsuspecting diners tucking into their steaks were actually eating horse meat.

Except this time, the year was 1948.

Footage re-released by newsreel company British Pathe shows how the black market trade in such meat was rife after the war.

In clipped tones, the narrator says at one point: 'Young horses in the prime of their life, prize-winners... even mares with foals are all MEAT to such [black] marketeers.'

Two million Britons were feared to be eating the animal without knowing it, due to a racket that saw at least 750,000 horses slaughtered before it was eventually stamped out.

Unbeknown: Two million Brits were feared to be eating horse without knowing it, due to a racket that saw at least 750,000 horses slaughtered before it was eventually stamped out

Suspect: Newsreel company British Pathe has re-released historical footage that exposed a previous black market trade that involved horse meat being passed off to unsuspecting diners on a massive scale

It was legal to buy horse meat from butchers in 1948, but the price was strictly controlled – which led to gangs passing it off as other meat in order to cash in.

The British Pathe archive film has been posted onto YouTube and on the British Pathe website.

The narrator speaks over footage of horses being led to market and horse meat being taken into butcher’s shops. 

Full circle: The horse meat scandal engulfing Britain is a mirror image of a similar crisis that occurred in the UK food chain in 1948

Viewers are told: 'Public feeling grows against this sinister trade. The country demands action against a traffic so alien to the British people.'

Earlier in the clip, the newsreader outlined the scale of the problem and warned that veal from foals was also being sold.

He said: 'Horse meat is rapidly becoming part of Britain’s diet. Three million people buy it every week, but less than half that number know it.

'Only one in three buys from the butcher who sells at the controlled price of a shilling a pound.

For sale: Earlier in the clip, the newsreader outlined the scale of the problem and warned that veal from foals was also being sold

'It is estimated that three quarters of the horse meat sold goes to the backstreet restaurants, where the customers are offered black market steaks – or even veal - the flesh of foals.'

Viewers were then warned that the gangs involved were operating nationwide.

The narrator continued: 'To supply 
this sordid market, agents scour the country, they are present at every 
horse fair to buy meat on the hoof, viewing the animals with a butcher’s
eye.

'Eight out of ten horses sold these days (in 1948) are said to reach the slaughterhouses.

The narrator said 'Horsemeat is rapidly becoming part of Britain's diet. Three million people buy it every week, but less than half that number know it'

Debate: The archive clip has caused a large amount of debate online, in the light of recent discoveries of horse DNA in meat products sold in British supermarkets

'Young horses in the prime of life, even mares with their foals, are all meat to such marketeers. In a little over three years a quarter of a million horses have been killed.'

The archive clip has caused a large amount of debate online, in the light of recent discoveries of horse DNA in meat products sold in British supermarkets.

A spokesperson for British Pathe said: 'The British Pathe news report from 1948 just shows how the horse meat scandal is no new phenomenon.

Back in the ‘40s horses were slaughtered and then sold to backstreet restaurants where the meat was passed off as veal or steak.

'It was a huge trade.'

One YouTube user said: 'The very thought of eating any more meat is beginning to make me sick.'
