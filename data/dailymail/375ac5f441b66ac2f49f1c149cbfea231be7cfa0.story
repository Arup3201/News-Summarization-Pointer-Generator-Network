North Carolina officer Josh Lefevers shot and killed James Allen, 74, just before midnight on Sunday morning

A North Carolina officer shot dead a 74-year-old man whose concerned family had called the police and asked to check on him.

Officer Josh Lefevers arrived at the home of James Allen just before midnight on Sunday morning and announced he was entering the residence when Allen approached him with a handgun and refused to put it down, police said.

Lefevers then shot and killed him. 

The officer first went to Allen's home around 10pm after relatives called the Gastonia police for a welfare check but there was no answer at the door, according to the Gaston Gazette. 

Officials called nearby hospitals but could not locate Allen. 

Neighbors said they hadn't seen him since Friday, and his car was parked at home.

Allen had just recently undergone a medical procedure and his family was concerned for his well-being. 

Police then called the local emergency services and fire department to assist with what they believed was a possible death inside the house.

After another knock went unanswered the fire department helped Lefevers enter through the back door of Allen's home.

Gastonia Police Chief Robert Helton said officers were concerned Allen was inside and 'in need of emergency assistance.'  

Lefevers announced he was entering the house and then saw Allen pointing the gun at him, Helton said. 

Lefevers was hired by the department in 2012 and serves on the patrol division.  

Lefevers first knocked on Allen's door (pictured) at 10pm but there was no answer. Police then contacted the fire department to help them enter the house because they feared Allen might need 'emergency assistance'
