The chain, whose headquarters are in Eastleigh, Hampshire, is also anticipating it will need 'extra stock' to deal with the demand. 

The memo said: 'We stock many of the products featured in this notable scene and then used later in the film. 

The memo (above) was circulated to the DIY store's entire 20,887 workforce at 359 stores and was entitled: 'Staff Briefing – Preparation for Fifty Shades of Grey Customer Queries' 

'When the book was released in 2012 DIY and hardware stores in the UK and US reported increased demand of certain products and queries from customers as they tried to recreate their own 'Fifty Shades' experiences.

'We need to be prepared for the same effect when the film is released this month.'

'Nevertheless, all staff should read this briefing notice to prepare for potentially sensitive customer enquiries and managers need to be aware of the implications that the film may have on stock levels.'  

The chain is expecting a rise in demand from customers for rope (pictured) which is used in the erotic film 

The firm also believes it could sell out of duct tape (pictured) due to the film's release on February 14

The memo warned managers to 'anticipate the need for extra stock' of items such as cable wires (pictured)

The eagerly-anticipated movie, which was written as a book in 2011, follows the relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and businessman Christian Grey.

Grey introduces her to the world of bondage and dominant sexual role play. 

Preview footage of the film depicts a notable scene from the book where Grey visits a hardware store to purchase rope, cable ties and tape.

The wealthy young businessman, played by Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan, 32, buys the products to fulfill his sexual pursuits and meets the graduate, played by Dakota Johnson, 25.   

Following the film release of Fifty Shades of Grey, B&Q employees may encounter increased customer product queries relating to rope, cable ties and masking or duck tape. Store Managers should anticipate the need for extra stock and store staff should read the following brief to prepare them to handle potentially sensitive customer questions.

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

On Saturday 14th February 2015 popular erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey will be released as a film and is expected to do well in the Box Office. Written by E.L. James, the story follows the relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young, successful business man, Christian Grey, who introduces her to the world of bondage and dominant/submissive sexual role play.

Preview footage depicts a notable scene from the book where Christian Grey visits a hardware store to purchase rope, cable ties and tape. Rather than bought for home improvement purposes, these products are intended to fulfil Mr Grey's unconventional sexual pursuits.
