Sir Dave Brailsford has risked the wrath of British cycling fans by setting himself the astonishing target of delivering a first FRENCH Tour de France winner in 30 years.

After masterminding Great Britain’s Olympic cycling success, Brailsford created a ‘British’ pro team at Team Sky with the sole intention of delivering a first British Tour winner. It was central to his mission statement at the launch of Team Sky in February 2009.

But in an interview with the French sports daily L’Equipe, Brailsford said: ‘We have won the Tour with a British rider, but when are we going to see a French rider win the Tour? That would be enormous.’

Favouring the French: Brailsford says a French Tour winner 'needs to happen'

Asked if a French winner would be his next objective, he replied: ‘Yes, I would like to win with a French rider.

‘I think it needs to happen. For the Tour, for France, for the French, for the sport, having a French winner would be massive.

‘I think about it often. France deserves a French winner.’

It was only a few months ago that Brailsford stepped down as performance director of British cycling, having concluded it was proving too much to combine the role with his job as team principal at Sky.

But there is no doubt that Team Sky has benefitted from the relationship that continues with British cycling – and vice versa of course - and the desire to deliver a French champion could be unpalatable to many of those involved.

Particularly when there is such a sharing of resources that has even extended to their headquarters in Manchester.

Brailsford is now looking to establish a permanent HQ in Nice for the pro team. But there is £30million of public money invested in the British team building towards the Rio Olympics in 2016 and that will be supporting some of Sky’s riders.

When Sky announced their plans to launch a pro cycling team in February 2009, they celebrated ‘the creation of a professional British road cycling team’ to be ‘managed by Great Britain Olympic performance director Dave Brailsford CBE’.

The statement added: ‘Team Sky will build on the principles that make British riders a consistent success on the track and will support Sky’s work as Principal Partner of British Cycling, fuelling the sport from grass roots to elite level.

‘Team Sky will aim to create the first British winner of the Tour de France, within five years.’

In the statement Brailsford said: ‘This will be an epic story; building a British team to take on the best in professional cycling, and win.’ It added that ‘Team Sky will have a core of British riders’.

Brailsford has delivered, with Chris Froome following Sir Bradley Wiggins in becoming the second British winner of the Tour in two years last time round. Froome is the favourite to win again this year to establish an era of dominance for Sky.

Not since Bernard Hinault in 1985 have the French had a winner of their race.

A fluent French speaker, Brailsford may be guilty of nothing more than trying to please his audience the day before the Tour rolls into France, but with Wiggins and Pete Kennaugh among those omitted from Sky’s nine-man Tour team, there are only two Britons riding in Froome and Geraint Thomas.

Many of Team Sky’s rivals select riders predominantly from their country of origin. FDJ has nine French riders, Europcar eight Frenchmen, Belkin seven Dutchmen and Movistar seven Spaniards.

In fairness to Brailsford, he has long insisted riders would not be selected based on their passports. From a total squad of 28 at Sky, there are in fact nine British riders.
