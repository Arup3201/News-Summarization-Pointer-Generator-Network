A ride at Lunar Park has left residents of the surrounding areas outraged, prompting some to make submissions to North Sydney Council to have the ride removed.

The Hair Raiser, a 37-metre tall ride opened in late 2013 without council approval, has infuriated neighbours due to its height and resulting noise pollution.

Neighbours have claimed the ride beams into their apartments and prompts loud screams that are depriving them of sleep, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Operators, who argue that thrilling rides have been pivotal to the Luna Park experience since the 1980's, are currently seeking planning approval for the ride.

In an application, they have claimed the ride did not have any 'significant adverse impacts' and was helping the park remain in operation.

Hair Raiser allows patrons to be elevated to the top of the tower, witnessing sweeping views of the harbour, before plunging at more than 80km/h.

It was revealed last year that the operators never obtained the required approvals to erect the ride.

North Sydney Council have claimed the ride is 'visually offensive' and unsuitable for its location.

A number of scathing submissions to the council have been made by locals. In one, the neighbour writes:

'We object to this ride as it is operating without DA approval. We object to its position and the flashing lights which can operate 24 hours a day as this causes noise pollution and loss of amenity to adjacent residents.'

Another wrote it was 'an ugly monstrosity' akin to a permanent crane on the skyline.

Luna Park was forced to close in 1996 due to financial burdens, including the closure of some rides due to noise complaints. It was reopened in 2004.

It is now on the state heritage register.
