A parkour expert has created an internet sensation with his film of incredibly acrobatic free-runners dressed in Star Wars costumes.

The video was shot by Ronnie Shalvis, from Utah in America and has already had more than 800,000 views online.

The 22-year-old free-runner turned to filmmaking after a back injury stopped him from doing the sport, a mixture of acrobatics and athletics.

Aerodynamic acrobatics: A video of free-runners performing parkour in the desert dressed in Star Wars costumes has become an internet sensation

Parkour uses urban and natural settings and obstacles such as balconies and high buildings. It has become a huge hit after appearing in action films such as James Bond movie Casino Royale and The Bourne movies.

The James Bond parkour chase sequence in Casino Royale is billed as one of the most ambitious in the history of the action series.

The Star Wars video sees two 
free-runners wearing Jedi costumes leaping and tumbling across a desert 
much like Luke Skywalker's home planet Tataouine.

The
 video follows the free-runners across the barren landscape until 
finally, facing each other, we see a flash of the familiar lightsabers.

According to Mr Shalvis this is a glimpse of what is to come.

He said: ‘If the Star Wars video does really well then we will be doing a sequel including an epic lightsaber battle.’

Based in and around South Jordan, Utah, 
the production crew have taken advantage of local beauty spots but Mr 
Shalvis said he would ultimately like to travel with his work and 
produce videos of this extreme sport in extreme locations.

The director said: ‘I have always wanted
 to travel the world to some of the craziest places you can think of and
 then I would use parkour in my films to explore the cities, ruins or 
jungles of wherever it may be.’

Despite the dangers of free-running, there have been no serious injuries in the making of his videos apart from the occasional cuts and bruises.

The director has covered all bases in the sci-fi genre as another one of his videos sees 'zombies' overrun an abandoned building.

The film was set in an abandoned mining 
area in Utah and see a group of free-runners take on zombie 
characteristics as they leap around the building site.

Mr Shalvis hopes this film grows in popularity too and said: ‘It brings to light a new idea of zombies that are as capable as athletes, and that's what a lot of people point out when they watch is how much scarier these types of zombies would be in real life.’

He has been free-running for eight years and a professional stuntman for two, so works with friends and colleagues to make these videos.

Parkour was founded by David Belle in France in the early 1990s and featured in Luc Besson film District B13.
