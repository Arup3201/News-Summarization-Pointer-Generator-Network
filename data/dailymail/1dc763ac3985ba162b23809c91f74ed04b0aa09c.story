The thought of putting on weight fills most A-listers with dread - but that hasn't stopped Spanish artist David Lopera, 20, from digitally fattening them up.

He then sells the altered images to men who like larger ladies - and is happy to take commissions that focus on a specific celebrity.

Among the famous women fattened up at the request of the men he describes as 'chubby chasers' are Rita Ora, Iggy Azaelea, Kim Kardashian and even Frozen's Princess Elsa.

And business certainly seems to be booming, with Mr Lopera, who comes from Menorca, revealing that he has been inundated with requests.

'Men are always writing to me asking if I can make their celebrities crushes look a bit fatter,' he explains.

'Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Kardashian are some of the most popular requests I get.'

Mr Lopera, who is in a relationship with a 'plump' woman himself, says that he, like his clients, thinks the famous faces look better with extra weight.

'These women look much better when they're overweight,' he says. 'I prefer Elsa [of Frozen fame] when she's a fat princess - that's a real woman right there.'

Now the 20-year-old is hoping to become internationally famous for his Photoshop work, all while showing the world that flab is better than abs.

'Look at my pictures and you will see that big is beautiful,' says Mr Lopera, who says plump is always more attractive than stick thin.

'For example, Mila Kunis is much sexier with chunky thighs and a bulging belly that hangs around her waist.'

A computer technician by day, Mr Lopera has been amusing himself with Photoshop art since his school days.

But he only began making money from his hobby after his altered image of an obese Katy Perry went viral after being published on Deviantart last year.

'I love Katy Perry but she would look much more sexy with a few extra pounds,' says Mr Lopera.

'So for my own pleasure, I manipulated her first album cover to make her look a bit chubby.

'I uploaded it online and soon, men were messaging me with requests to Photoshop other stars to look flabby.'

In less than a year, Mr Lopera has received over 200 requests from men across the world, all of whom like to fantasise about celebrities with a bit of podge.

Each work takes around two days - with four to six hours spent on each in total - to complete.

'Usually each manipulation takes a few days but there have been times when I've spent a whole week on just one,' he explains.

Part of the reason for the lengthy production time is that clients have very specific ideas about how they want the final result to look.

'I know my clients want their fat celebs to look as realistic as possible,' he explains. 'Some even have an idea of how much they want them to weigh. I don't stop until they look perfectly plump.

'When I get requests to make Disney characters - like Elsa and Ariel - look fat, I have to make a digital drawing on a pen tablet. That can take a long time too.'

Now Mr Lopera says he hopes to turn his part-time job into a full-time career. 'I would love to dedicate my life to this. 

'The big women are beautiful but there are many people today who don't agree with that. However when they see my gorgeous, fat celebrities, I think they might realise how wrong they are.'
