Dr Spencer appeared at a news conference on Tuesday morning where he described his time spent working for five weeks in Guinea, at the heart of the Ebola outbreak. 

He said: 'During this time,​ I cried as I held children who were not strong enough to survive the virus. 

'But,​ I also experienced immense joy when patients I treated were cured and invited me into their family as a brother upon discharge.'

After thanking the teams of medical staff who cared for him along with his friends and family, Dr Spencer said: 'While my case has garnered international attention, it is important to remember​ that my infection represents but a fraction of the more than 13,000 reported cases to date in West Africa - the center of the outbreak, where families are being torn apart and communities destroyed.'

Spencer, who traveled to West Africa with Doctors WithoutBorders, was joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio, cityofficials and Bellevue staff. 

Dr Craig Spencer leaves hospital on Tuesday with an army of doctors and health officials along with the New York mayor and his wife. The doctor was the last known person in the U.S. to have contracted Ebola while working in West Africa

Spencer's diagnosis followed trips on the subway to eat out
and go bowling with friends in Brooklyn, provoking public alarm about the
possible spread of the virus in the city.

Dr Craig Spencer initially told officers that he had isolated himself in his Harlem apartment after returning from Guinea, where he had been treating people for the illness.

It was only when cops checked his MetroCard and bank statement that they realized he had been roaming the city for nearly a week, visiting a sandwich shop, taking an Uber cab, and going bowling.

Officers rang Dr Spencer and confronted him with the evidence leading him to confess that he had been out and about, according to the New York Post.

During his time holed up in Bellevue, Dr Spencer has been playing the banjo and practicing yoga, it emerged last week. 

The doctor was also reportedly keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room.

Another source told the New York Post he has been playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff.

Neighbors who have not seen Spencer since he was
hospitalized three weeks ago said they were happy to hear he may
be headed home soon.

'I'm glad to hear he's well enough for that to happen,' one
woman told NY1 television.

'The building's been through a lot and I'm sure they have
been through more,' she said, referring to Spencer's fiancée,
who was quarantined in the apartment until recently. 

Dr Spencer's condition was upgraded from serious to stable after he received a blood transfusion from fellow US Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol, a missionary who contracted the disease in Liberia.

The method was also used to treat Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, Dr Nancy Writebol and Dr Rick Sacra.

Dr Spencer will now be happily reunited with his fiancée, Morgan Dixon, at their Harlem home.

Ebola has killed more than 4,950 people since it broke out
in West Africa earlier this year, according to the World Health
Organization.

The bulk of the cases and deaths have come in
Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea 

In North Carolina, health officials said on Monday a
missionary, Dr. John Fankhauser, 52, of Ventura, California, was
deemed to be at 'some risk' for developing the disease after
returning from Liberia and had been placed under a 21-day
quarantine.

There has been only one Ebola death in the United States -
Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted the disease in his native
Liberia and died in Dallas, where he had gone to visit.

In Maine, nurse Kaci Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in
West Africa and publicly fought quarantine orders in New Jersey
and Maine after returning to the United States last month,
planned to move from her Fort Kent home after her quarantine
expired on Monday, according to local media.

On Sunday, CBS said that '60 Minutes' reporter Lara Logan
and her colleagues had quarantined themselves in a hotel in
South Africa after producing a report on an Ebola clinic in
Liberia.

Medical experts say Ebola can be transmitted only through
the bodily fluid of a person who is exhibiting symptoms.
