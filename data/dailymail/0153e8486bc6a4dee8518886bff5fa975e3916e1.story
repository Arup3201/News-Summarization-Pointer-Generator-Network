Imagine every time a plane completed a flight, the entire aircraft was scrapped and another built for the next journey.

That's the problem facing modern space travel. Each time a rocket is launched almost the entire structure is thrown away, often at the cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.

California-based SpaceX are hoping to change this with its Falcon 9 Reusable (F9R) rocket, which is seen taking off and landing in the same spot in this video.

Above can be seen the landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 Reusable rocket. The rocket 'hopped' to a height of 3,280ft (1km) before beginning its descent. It is the first time SpaceX has used stabilising 'grid fins' - the mesh-like struts at the bottom-  to stabilise the descent of the rocket

In the clip, released yesterday by SpaceX, the firm performs a test flight of its reusable rocket at its development facility in McGregor, Texas.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wants to help establish a colony of up to
 80,000 people on the planet, but admitted he’d like to start small, 
with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there.  

He ultimately plans to use a reusable 
rocket, fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane, to reach the red planet by 2026.

It would need to be much heavier than 
SpaceX’s current rockets, including the Falcon Heavy that is currently 
in development and is expected to launch by the end of this year.

'I'm hopeful that the first people could be taken to Mars in 10 to 12 years, I think it's certainly possible for that to occur,' he told CNBC.

'But the thing that matters long term is to have a self-sustaining city on Mars, to make life multi-planetary.'

However, he is taking no unnecessary risks. He famously once said: 'I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact.'

The rocket flies to 3,280ft (1km), remaining stable the entire time, before coming back to land on the ground.

The test follows the successful completion of the Grasshopper program last year, which saw SpaceX gradually increase the ceiling to which its reusable rockets jump.

While for now the technology is only capable of these brief hops, it will eventually be used on fully-fledged launches.

This will enable SpaceX to launch satellites into orbit and then bring most of the rocket that launched them there back to Earth.

This would be a level of reusablility not seen since the Space Shuttle, when Nasa used to recover the two side boosters called Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) from the ocean - in addition to the shuttle orbiters themselves being reusable.

But SpaceX’s plan would land the rocket straight back on the pad it took off from and it could be ready for another launch very rapidly.

In the latest experiments, SpaceX tested a set of steerable fins for the first time, called grid fins. These are seen as the mesh-like fins towards the bottom of the rocket in the video.

Falcon
 9 topped with SpaceX fairing is 224.4 feet (68.4 meters) tall and 12 
feet in diameter (the fairing is 17 feet in diameter).

Its
 nine first-stage Merlin engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust 
at sea level, rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as Falcon 9 climbs 
out of the Earth’s atmosphere.

Falcon
 9 is named after the Millennium Falcon starship in the Star Wars movies. The 
number 9 refers to the nine Merlin engines that power Falcon 9’s first 
stage; one Merlin vacuum engine powers the second stage.

They deploy approximately one minute and 15 seconds into the flight and provide control of the rocket to fly it back to ground.

The next steps for the rocket will be to launch to higher altitudes, proving the rocket can successfully land in more flight-like circumstances.

And, ultimately, the final goal is to use it on a real launch and bring a rocket back to the ground - so far the technology has only been used by SpaceX to bring a rocket to a controlled landing in the ocean after launching to space.

In an interview with CNBC, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk outlined the ultimate plans for SpaceX with regards to reusable rockets.

'What we hope to achieve and can perhaps encourage industry to do is to have full reusability with rocketry,' he said.

'It's never been done. You can imagine in any mode of transport if there was not reusability, like aircraft or cars, that there could be very little use of that.'

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has grand plans for his space agency. With help from Nasa he has grown the company significantly in a decade. It is now capable of taking cargo to the ISS with its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket and, beginning possibly in the next few years, the company will take humans into space

Private spaceflight company SpaceX successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets in September 2013 (pictured). The 22-story rocket soared off a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Station with 60 per cent stronger engines than its predecessor

He went on to state that it would be 'revolutionary' to ultimately be able to recover a rocket booster and then fly it.

'Now we have been trying to do that for 12 years and haven't yet succeeded, but I feel as though we are finally close to achieving it.'

He added the firm hopes to recover a booster later this year with a view to re-flying it in 2015.

'This would really mark a significant change in the technology of rocketry,' he said.

Space X is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. Pictured is the Falcon 9 rocket, which will be adapted to use this reusable technology and land back on a launch pad in the future

This technology will eventually be used for fully-fledged launches, which would allow SpaceX to use rockets on multiple occasions
