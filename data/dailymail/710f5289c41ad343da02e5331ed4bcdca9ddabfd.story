Video has surfaced of a violent brawl at last week’s Stereosonic festival in Sydney, which saw one man knocked unconscious amid a flurry of punches from a group of men.

The footage shows about 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit of the stage at the Sydney Showgrounds.

Security guards in high visibility shirts can be seen failing to stop the wild brawl, while surrounding punters barely bat an eyelid at the man who is lying unconscious, continuing to dance around him.

Richard Calugay, who watched the fight first hand, told Daily Mail Australia it started with pushing.

‘Someone pushed me in the back and the whole crowd started backing up. One of the guys king hit the guy in a blue shorts and knocked him out, and then it was on’ he said.

‘The guy was knocked out cold. I saw him get carried away by his mates, and we left the stage at that point, but I heard the fight kept on going afterwards.’

Mr Calugay said security were simply outnumbered at the event.

‘I think the security were reluctant to get involved because of the size of the guys and the amount of people around. They were outnumbered and didn’t think it was worth the risk.’

Stereosonic is an annual music festival with events in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. This year saw more than 81,000 revellers attend the Sydney festival

Mr Calugay said he believes the type and the number of festival-goers set the scene for a brawl.

‘I think Stereosonic is a very alpha-male festival. There are a lot of big guys in there, and when you mix that with a crowd of that size, you have a recipe for violence.’

He said he saw other fights throughout the day that weren’t filmed.

The clip has received hundreds of thousands of views since being uploaded. 

NSW police said they were disappointed with the large number of revellers found in possession of prohibited drugs at the music festival on the weekend.

There were 196 people found in possession of prohibited drugs at the festival, including MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, GHB and Ketamine.

Stereosonic is an annual festival that takes place in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. More that 81,000 revellers attended the festival in Sydney this year.
