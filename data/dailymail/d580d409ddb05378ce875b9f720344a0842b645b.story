Vice President Joe Biden will today admit that he was bored during Barack Obama's delivery of the State of the Union address in an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show centered on plugging Obamacare legislation. 

Biden, who also wished his host a happy 57th birthday in the pre-filmed segment, said he had to feign interest on camera in the pivotal presidential address.

He compared his actions during Obama's speech to Congress last week to those of a loyal wife who must 'pretend to be interested' while her husband waxes lyrical.

The real reason: Biden then revealed he was actually on the show to lecture the audience about Obamacare, and give a detailed rundown of how they can sign up

Biden made the revelation while explaining an anecdote from his wife Jill, who said she gets the precise feeling of having heard it all before when she listens to him speak.

He told DeGeneres: 'You know I sit back there and I listen and I help write the ideas in the speech and I know it all... I got to pay attention.

'And she [Jill Biden] said, welcome to the club. And I said what do you mean? She said, welcome to the Good Wife’s Club.

'She said, how many times have I sat and listened to you make a speech and pretend to be interested?'

On the subject of his wife, DeGeneres took the opportunity to press him on their Valentine's Day plans. But the Vice President only said he had 'a lot' in store for her, and declined to elaborate. 

After the tease, Biden used most of his remaining screentime to tell those watching to get on board with the Obama administration's flagship health reforms.

Making no secret of his intention, Biden said he wanted to use the TV spot to reach Ellen's audience of mothers and young people to encourage them to get state-mandated health insurance.

DeGeneres then gave him permission to talk through each sign-up method in turn, and said she would help spread the word via her website.

Biden admitted that the chance to plug Obamacare was the real reason he made the trip to DeGeneres's Los Angeles studios - but did also bring a gift for his host, albeit of a political kind.

Presenting her with a White House-branded bathrobe, he suggested she could wear it next year when Obama makes another State of the Union address.

He said: 'You talked about watching the State of The Union and watching me stand up.

Now next year when you watch it I want you to be able to be comfortable. I brought you a bathrobe with the White House Seal on it. A gift to Ellen from Joe, so you’re comfortable.'
