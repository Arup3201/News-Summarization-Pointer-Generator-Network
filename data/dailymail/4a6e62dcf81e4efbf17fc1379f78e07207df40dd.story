Microsoft hopes to banish the password from mobile phones and computer with the next version of Windows.

Instead of remembering a complex password, users will simply need to look at their phone or use a fingerprint reader.

Called Windows Hello, it will be part of Windows 10 when it launches later this year.

Windows 10 will not require a password - users can opt to instead use facial recognition to log into their phone or computer

A combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you, not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you.

The cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions.

These security features are opt-in, meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and PINs to unlock devices and features if they so desire.

'When we started building Windows 10, the team spent a lot of time and energy thinking about how to make computing more personal,' said Joe Belfiore of Microsoft.

'We want your devices to recognize you, to understand what you're saying… we want the experience to go wherever you do and we want you to feel a great sense of TRUST as you go. 

Called Windows Hello, the new system introduces support for biometric authentication – using your face, iris, or fingerprint to unlock your devices – with technology that is much safer than traditional passwords. 

'You- uniquely you- plus your device are the keys to your Windows experience, apps, data and even websites and services – not a random assortment of letters and numbers that are easily forgotten, hacked, or written down and pinned to a bulletin board,' Belfiore said. 

The firm is also confident the system cannot be fooled - and has even tested users holding up pictures of others.

New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'.

Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store.

Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. 

Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised.

'Not only is Windows Hello more convenient than typing a password—it's more secure! 

'Our system enables you to authenticate applications, enterprise content, and even certain online experiences without a password being stored on your device or in a network server at all.' 

The firm also hit out at current password systems.

 'Today, passwords are the primary method most of us use to protect our personal information, but they are inconvenient and insecure. 

Individual documents can also be locked using the technology

'They are easily hackable and even when complex they are not effective, but most of us want something easy to remember, so we either choose a simple password or end up noting it down somewhere making it less secure.

'You may have seen recent press coverage about a single group collecting 1.2 billion user names and passwords from websites they hacked. 

'This creates lousy odds in the hacker roulette for all of us – there are only about 2 billion people online today!' 

Windows 10 will include a new Xbox app to allow users to easily share with friends, and is extremely similar to the firm's Xbox One console system.

The company also revealed that Windows 10 devices shipping this autumn will have built-in Windows Hello features, and devices that already have fingerprint readers will also support the technology.

'OEM systems incorporating Intel's RealSense 3D Camera (F200) will support the facial and iris unlock features of Windows Hello, including automatic sign-in to Windows, and support to unlock Passport without the need for a PIN,' the company said.

These security features are opt-in, meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and PINs to unlock devices and features if they so desire.
