As the original cockney pop stars they fill their lyrics with rhyming slang and sing in their East End accents.

So if anyone was a fan of EastEnders you would think it would be the veteran singing duo Chas & Dave.

Instead, the pair have accused the BBC soap of being ‘totally unrealistic’, and say the world they grew up in has now vanished for good.

Dave Peacock, 69, who was brought up in Enfield, said: ‘EastEnders completely misses the sense of humour in the East End that was fostered in the Blitz.

‘The BBC think the East End has got to be gloomy, but it doesn’t at all. East Enders are cheerful. They’ve only got the accents, but not the spirit of the people. It isn’t true to the area in the slightest.

‘I think Englishness has probably changed since we started. London has certainly changed. The old Londoners don’t seem to be around like they were anymore. They have died out. Everything changes.

‘I do get disappointed by some things in our country, but other things are great.’

Chas & Dave’s major breakthrough was with the track Gertcha in 1979, which peaked at number 20 in the charts. They have gone on to make nine best-selling albums and continue to tour around the UK.

Other well-known hits sung in their unique ‘rockney’ style include Rabbit and Ain’t No Pleasing You.

Last month they were given the Icon Award at the annual Nordoff Robbins Silver Clef music awards.

Chas, whose real name is Charles Hodges, said the secret to the band’s success was their early decision to sing in their own accents.

He said: ‘We simply became ourselves. Singing in the way that we speak about things we know about. Some people assumed we couldn’t be real cockneys and we must be putting it on because it was such an unusual thing to do.

‘Before that I did Jerry Lee Lewis take offs in an American accent.’

The 70-year-old grew up in Edmonton, north London, but his family is also from the East End. He said: ‘The whole place has changed beyond recognition. Everything changes, but you shouldn’t keep harping on about the past.

‘We have never set out to stand up for one particular view of Britain. We just try to be ourselves and play the music we like.’
