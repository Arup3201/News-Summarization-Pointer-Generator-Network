President Obama's top campaign advisers declared on Sunday that Republican Mitt Romney was in 'deep trouble' and had no chance of winning the election on Tuesday, citing President Bill Clinton's help as a key factor.

'As many ups and downs as it has been in this journey -  two days away from winning re-election with Clinton on the plane - we'd far rather be us than them,' Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on board Air Force One Sunday, as the president and Clinton sat huddled together in another section of the plane.

The 42nd and 44th U.S. presidents are scheduled to campaign together in Florida, Ohio and Colorado before Obama's final day of campaigning on Monday in Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa, when Clinton will hold four events in Pennsylvania.

The appearance came on the same day as vice president Joe Biden predicted a big Election Day win for the president.

'I think we’re going to win. I don’t think it will be close in the electoral college, I think we're going to win clearly,' he said during an interview with Chris Matthews.

'And I think you're going to see, I think we're going to win this state, Ohio. I've been in here 23, 24 days, something like that.

'I think we're going to win Iowa, we're going to win Wisconsin, we're going to win Nevada, we're going to win New Hampshire. I think we've got an even change of winning Wirginia and Florida so it could be a big win. and it also could be close. But I think the firewall here of Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, I think it's going to hold firm.'

Top Obama adviser David Axelrod echoed his confidence, and insisted that the Romney campaign is running 
scared.

'They understand that they're in deep
trouble,' Axelrod said on 'Fox News Sunday.' 'They've tried to expand 
the map because they know in states like Ohio… they're behind and 
they're not catching up at this point.'

Axelrod was referring to the Romney 
campaign's late push to win Pennsylvania, a state that typically votes 
Democratic but that Republicans think they can swing to their advantage 
on Tuesday. The state carries 20 electoral votes, two more than the 
prized battleground state of Ohio.

Reaching out: Obama makes a point to shake hands with one special young supporter

Feeling the love: He appears giddy at one event in Cincinnati, Ohio on Sunday

A Chicago Tribune poll released 
Sunday provided evidence that Republicans' strategy may be working: It 
showed Romney and Obama tied at 47 per cent support among the state's 
likely voters.

With two days until the election, 
national polls show Obama and Romney running neck and neck as they 
sprint to the finish line with jam-packed campaign schedules taking them
to nearly every swing state from now until Election Day. 

But Axelrod said he's not concerned.

He argued that Romney's late trips to
Florida and Virginia are signs that Republicans haven't locked up 
states where they should be performing well.

'They understand that the 
traditional, or the battleground, states that we've been focusing are 
not working out for them,' Axelrod said. 'Now they're looking for 
somewhere, desperately looking for somewhere.'

Tireless: Former President Bill Clinton has appeared with Obama countless times but now is being used at separate campaign events like one in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Sunday

Traveling man: He also made an appearance in North Carolina on Sunday, hitting key markets

While both candidates' campaigns are 
outwardly maintaining confidence that they will be victorious once all 
the votes are tallied, advisers on both sides say they are concerned 
about projections of a painstakingly close race.

Axelrod said it may even take until 
Wednesday morning to determine the winner of the election, because the 
race could be so close.

'I think that some of these races are
very close, and so it could extend past midnight into the morning,' he 
said. 'I don't think by this time of the morning, we'll still be 
wondering who the president is.'

Clinton, who maintains the highest 
approval rating of any former president, has been one of Obama's biggest
assets in the final days before the election.

Clinton joined Obama in 
the highly contested state of Virginia on Saturday at a rally that 
attracted more than 24,000 supporters.

Celebrity support: Stevie Wonder performed at an Ohio rally for Obama on Sunday

Clinton, Obama and former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine took the stage in Virginia clad in matching black jackets as Election Day forecasters declared that Obama was taking the lead among early voters in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio.

'As you see, I have given my voice in
the service of my president,' Clinton told the crowd.

A confident Obama heaped praise on the popular former president.

'He has been traveling all across the
country for this campaign,' Obama said. 'He's been laying out the stakes so well that
our team basically calls him the "Secretary of Explaining Stuff."'

'He was a great president; he has been a great friend,' he added.

President Barack Obama is counting on former President Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen, top surrogates for his campaign, to carry his message.

But he also has enlisted an army of A-list performers and public figures -- from Lady Gaga to Billie Jean King, from Jay-Z to Crosby, Stills and Nash - to promote his re-election.

The Obama campaign provided a who's-who of 181 actors, musicians, authors, athletes, mayors, Congress members, and more that fit any and all demographic groups in the president's target zone.

All are being deployed to carry his message to television and radio in the waning days of a nip-and-tuck campaign.

On Saturday, Stevie Wonder played an unannounced concert for voters waiting in line to vote early in Cleveland.

Songwriter John Legend, actor Laurence Fishburne, and congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis from Georgia were among those who went to Ohio to lead a 'Souls to the Polls' effort with local churches.

The list includes some of Hollywood's big names - Samuel L. Jackson, Anne Hathaway, and Scarlett Johansson - who were talking to Top 40 radio stations.

Jackson and comedian Chris Rock were on stations with primarily African American audiences urging voters to go to the polls Tuesday.

Danny DeVito and members of the FX sitcom 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' have canvassed neighborhoods in Wisconsin, made phone calls and visited colleges in the state.
