Greenpeace activists have been forced to apologise after damaging an ancient Peruvian monument during a publicity stunt.

Activists from Greenpeace placed a banner next to a figure of a hummingbird, carved more than 1,500 years ago, in a bid to highlight the case for action at the UN climate summit in Lima.

The Peruvian government said it would press criminal charges against Greenpeace activists who left footprints close to the carvings.

Oops: Activists from Greenpeace placed a banner next to a figure of a hummingbird, carved more than 1,500 years ago, but came under fire for damaging the monument from Peruvian authorities

Greenpeace said in a statement that they are deeply concerned about any ‘moral offence’

‘It’s a true slap in the face at everything Peruvians consider sacred,’ said Luis Jaime Castillo, the country’s deputy culture minister.

Mr Castillo added: ‘They are absolutely fragile. They are black rocks on a white background. You walk there and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years.

‘And the line that they have destroyed is the most visible and most recognised of all.’

The government is asking for the identities of those involved and threatening prosecution and six years in prison for the offenders.

The ancient depictions of animals, including a monkey and a hummingbird are etched into the arid plain of Southern Peru, a UN world heritage site.

They are believed to have had ritual functions related to astronomy.

Visits to the site are closely supervised - ministers and presidents have to seek special permission and special footwear to tread on the fragile ground.

Twenty Greenpeace activists from seven countries unfurled a protest banner very close to the lines, reading ‘Time for Change! The Future is Renewable.’

Tina Loeffelbein, spokeswoman for Greenpeace, said the activists had been careful not to cause damage.

Greenpeace said in a statement that they are deeply concerned about any ‘moral offence’.

Dr Henry Carhuatocto, representing the group, said: ‘The peaceful protest by Greenpeace in the area of the Nazca lines was to demonstrate the impacts of climate change and honour the historical legacy of this town who learned to live with the environment without affecting it.’
