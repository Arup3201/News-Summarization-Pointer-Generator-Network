Diane Sawyer is in the final stages of securing an exclusive interview with Bruce Jenner during which the Olympic gold medalist turned reality star will discuss his intentions to transition to live as a woman, according to reports.

Rumors about Jenner's desire to come out as transgender have intensified in recent months after he started making dramatic changes to his appearance including having his Adam's apple shaved, growing his hair long and wearing nail polish.

The speculation intensified over the weekend when People magazine quoting a 'Jenner insider' as confirming that the rumors are true.

'Bruce is transitioning to a woman,' the family insider confirmed.

'He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he's doing. He's in such a great space. That's why it's the perfect time to do something like this.'

Jenner hasn't officially confirmed the speculation, but BuzzFeed reports that Sawyer and ABC News are close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision.

Bruce made the formal announcement to his large family last month which was filmed for a docu-series recording his journey from man to woman to be broadcast later this year.

The reality show will air on E!, the NBC Universal cable channel that has broadcast Kardashian-based reality shows since 2007.

The exclusive with 65-year-old Jenner would be a huge coup for ABC since E!'s corporate sibling NBC News would have seemed the more obvious choice.

Not landing the Jenner interview has caused much strife in the news division, reports Buzzfeed.

The former Olympic gold medalist has been pictured in recent months with manicured nails, smooth legs, longer locks and what appeared to be fuller lips.

People's source revealed that the Kardashian-Jenner family has been allowed time to get used to the idea, and that they're slowly accepting his decision.

'He's being very smart about and also respectful about his transition,' the insider said. 'Instead of completely shocking everyone, his changes have been subtle, and his family has had the chance to slowly get used to his new looks and life.'

'He has come out to those closest to him... He's been through a dark period and is coming out on the other side,' added the insider.

The transgender rumours began in 2013 shortly after he separated from his third wife Kris Jenner and moved into a Malibu beach bachelor pad

The transgender rumors began in 2013 shortly after he separated from his third wife Kris Jenner and moved into a Malibu beach bachelor pad.

Stepdaughter Kim hinted at Bruce's transition last month when she told Entertainment Tonight: 'I think everyone goes through things in life, and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' 

Bruce has six children from his three marriages - daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, with Kris Jenner; sons Brandon, 33 and Brody, 31, with ex-wife Linda Thompson; and daughter Cassandra, 34, and son Burt, 36, with ex-wife Chrystie Crownover.

And he has four stepchildren from his marriage to Kris: Kourtney, 35, Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Rob, 27.
