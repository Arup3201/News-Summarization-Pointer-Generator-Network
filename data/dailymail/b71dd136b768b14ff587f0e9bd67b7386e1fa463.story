A group of Texas gun activists have taken to confronting officers on the streets, armed with video cameras - and assault rifles.

The 'Cop Block' videos that they shoot and post online are meant to hold police accountable and combat police brutality. The activists say they're well within their rights to do it while openly carrying rifles, shotguns and antique pistols. 

The activists in the Dallas suburbs carry police radios so they can track the movements of police and film officers making arrests and conducting traffic stops. They also try to find police drunk driving checkpoints and speed traps and warn drivers about the officers up ahead.

Cardova was arrested last week after he pulled up to film a traffic stop while carrying a black powder revolver on his hip - which he says is legal under Texas law

Kory Watkins, a Texas gun activist, has already made a name for himself by carrying an AK-47 in public - as is legal under state law

One video shows a 'Cop Block' activist being arrested after arriving at a crime scene with a camera wearing a black powder handgun on his belt. He hurls insults at the officers as he tells them that the weapon is legal to carry openly in the state of Texas.

'What crime have I committed?' the activist, Jacob Cordova shouts at cops who are handcuffing him.

'You're carrying a firearm,' an officer responds.

'It's not a firearm, it's a pre-1899 black powder pistol (which is legal to openly carry under Texas law),' Cordova says.

The officer replies: 'We'll figure it out.'

Cordova shouts back: 'You better f***ing figure it out, ya douchebags!' 

He then proceeds to call one of the officers 'a little c**k s***er.' 

Videos posted on Kory Watkins' YouTube page show several confrontations with officers when they showed up at traffic stops and filmed the police while armed

 

Watkins, seen here talking to a police officer while armed, is one of several Texas libertarians who have seized on police brutality civil rights issues 

Among the activities that the group undertakes is warning drivers about speed traps and DUI checkpoints - while armed, of course

'The police department in Arlington is out of control and keeps wrongfully arresting people for doing things that are well within their rights. It’s wasting taxpayer money and it’s violating the rights of the people,' the group's leader, Kory Watkins, an Olive Garden bartender, told the Daily Beast. 

The activists, who often identify themselves as Ron Paul libertarians or members of the Tea Party, say they've picked up the mantle of civil rights activists protesting alleged police brutality against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York. 

They've even taken up the mantra of shouting 'hands up, don't shoot' and 'I can't breathe.'

Cops say the activists have, at times, been a threat to officers who are just going about their jobs.

Several members of the group have been arrested for various charges - disturbing the peace, and police fear that their interactions are becoming increasingly hostile.

Jacob Cordova, the 27-year-old Air Force veteran who was caught on video being arrested for carrying an antique handgun, pulled up to a police traffic stop and pulled up his vest to show them that he was armed, police say. 

'When you see somebody being aggressive, interfering with a stop, and armed with a deadly weapon, the officer can’t just ignore that,' Arlington police Sergeant Jeffrey Houston told the Daily Beast. 

Cordova denies that he did anything illegal.
