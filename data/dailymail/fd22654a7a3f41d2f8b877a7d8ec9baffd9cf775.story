What do all these classic film scenes have in common? They all involve weapons. Or at least they did.

A new internet craze has seen movie fans trying to doctor film history by replacing guns with something altogether more positive - a thumbs up pose.

The images suggest that some of Hollywood's most recognisable characters, from Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry to Jamie Foxx's Django, should have swapped their weapons for something more encouraging.

Peace: Terminator adopts a pose more often seen in Arnold Scwarzenegger's election campaigning

But despite the message of pacifism encouraged by the posts, film buffs will be left scratching their heads as they are forced to look upon the scenes in a completely different way.

In one picture, ultra cop John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, is seen bracing himself for a testosterone-fuelled exchange.

But the gun-toting policeman's semiautomatic has been erased, instead showing him giving an enthusiastic double thumbs up.

Elsewhere, a collection of film hard men, such as James Bond and Arnold Scwarzenegger's Terminator, have also been stripped of their customary guns.

Even Rambo, Sylvester Stallone's ultimate tough guy and Batman, have adopted the universal sign.

The posts were gathered on the blog Thumbs & Ammo, having been doctored by internet users.

The blog's tagline informs users that 'real tough guys don't need guns, they just need a positive, can-do attitude'.
