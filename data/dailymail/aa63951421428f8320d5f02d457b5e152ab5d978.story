William Hague said Ed Miliband’s decision to vote down plans for strikes against Syria had ‘not helped perceptions of the West being ready to defend itself’

Labour's decision to block military action against Syria last year has ‘emboldened’ the West’s enemies, William Hague warned yesterday.

The former foreign secretary said Ed Miliband’s decision to vote down plans for retaliatory strikes against Syria had ‘not helped perceptions of the West being ready to defend itself’.

Mr Hague suggested Labour was now in danger of repeating the same error by demanding a United Nations Security Council resolution on tackling Islamic State (Isil) in Syria before contemplating action in the country.

He said it was completely unrealistic to demand a UN resolution given Russia’s public opposition and said it would be dangerous to get ‘hung up’ on the issue. 

Mr Hague suggested ministers will now try to build the case for action in Syria before asking MPs to vote on the issue. 

‘There isn’t yet a political consensus on taking action, but we haven’t excluded that,’ he said.

MPs have so far only been asked to sanction bombing against Isil forces in Iraq, partly because of Labour’s caution over Syria. 

But a string of ministers yesterday suggested the Government could return to the issue of military action in Syria very soon.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Sky News: ‘Isil is based in Syria, it has been attacking Iraq from Syria, and it needs to be defeated in Syria as well as Iraq.

‘We have not taken a decision on that yet. It is something we are going to review. We will see how that campaign goes, but in the end Isil do have to be defeated in Syria.’

David Cameron said he had ‘a lot of sympathy’ for the argument that Britain needs to be involved in Syria as well as Iraq, but said he had been constrained by the need to get a political ‘consensus’ at Westminster.

The Prime Minister dismissed the need for British ground troops, saying: ‘We’re not trying to defeat Isil from the air alone.

‘We believe you do need troops on the ground, but they should be Iraqi troops, they should be Kurdish troops.’ And he dismissed calls to work with Syria tyrant Bashar al-Assad, saying he was ‘part of the problem, not the solution’.

Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker stressed that Labour supported the US-led air strikes in Syria, even though the party had set a series of further conditions before British action there could be considered.

Mr Coaker said a ‘much more cautious’ approach was needed in Syria and said Labour would not ‘give a blank cheque to the Government’.

He said it was ‘important’ to seek a UN resolution, adding: ‘We need to understand that it’s complex in Syria, it’s difficult in Syria. What is the outcome that we want to achieve?’
