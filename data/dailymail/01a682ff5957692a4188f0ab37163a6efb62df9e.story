North Korea says it's ready for a 'full scale nuclear war' and called South Korea's president a 'crafty prostitute' with president Obama as her 'powerful pimp.'

The North Korean insults come after President Obama visited  South Korea and its president Park Geun-hye for two days in which both leaders asked that North Korea not proceed with its nuclear program.

The Committee for Peaceful Reunification of Korea CPRK)  said, 'Park Geun-hye's recent behavior with Obama was like a mean immature girl begging gangsters to beat up someone she does not like. Or a crafty prostitute eagerly trying to frame someone by giving her body to a powerful pimp.'

The Korean Newws Agency (KCNA) said the official English translation of North Korea's description of Park was as a 'capricious whore.'

North Korea called Obama 'master' and Park Guen-hye his 'puppet' and said that Park would pay a 'dear price,' reports The Guardian.

Satellite imagery has shown an increase in activity at North Korea's nuclear test site and Park warned that Pyongang was ready to execute another atomic test.

Both Obama and Park threatened North Korea with harsher rules and economic sanctions on the already poor country.

They encouraged China to speak against it's ally's nuclear threats.

The CPRK called the both Park and Obama's statements 'intolerable insults' against their leadership.

'In particular, Park Geun-Hye continued to viciously take issue with our dignity, system and nuclear programmes,' it said.

They said her remarks were as though she were 'froth(ing) at the mouth.'

'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the US and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,'  said the KCNA translation.

The CPRK claimed that Obama should have 'postponed or shelved his trip' following the ferry full of schoolchildren that sank in South Korea.

The CPRK said that Obama was 'utterly indifferent to the sorrow' felt by South Korea after the ferry incident.

'The latest visit by Obama only reaffirmed our long-held belief that might, not words, are the only option to deal with the old enemy US and strengthened our resolve and determination to stick with our policy to fight a full-scale nuclear war,' they said.

Pyongang is North Korea rejected South Korea's proposal to absorb the North into the South

'Park Geun-hye will pay a dear price for abandoning the opportunity we earlier gave and choosing a path of anti-unification and anti-peace and a path to confrontation and war,' they continued.

They also likened Park to a 'comfort woman,' a term used to describe women who were sexually enslaved by Japanese soldiers during World War II.

The comments will be a controversial topic in South Korea as it's still a touchy subject regarding their relationship with Tokyo.

North Korea has been known to criticize South Korean leaders including Park's predecessor Lee Myung-Bak.

The attacks on Park have been even more offensive and sexual in nature since she is the first female president in Seoul.

Park has expressed her wish to build a trusting relationship with Pyongang but she says she will also remain strong if she faces provocation.

Pyongang rejected her proposal to prepare for unification and to attempt to absorb North Korea into South Korea.

'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the US and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,' the KCNA translation said of Parks allied relations with the United States.
