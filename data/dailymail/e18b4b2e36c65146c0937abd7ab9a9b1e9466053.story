A warning for those planning to spend Saturday night on January 31 outside a Barclays Premier League club in the hope of inadvertently getting on SkySports: don’t bother.

The window actually closes on Monday February 2 at 11pm, having belatedly opened on January 3, and what do we have to show with it being a week old? Bupkis.

Well, that may be a fib. We have Steven Gerrard for one, joining LA Galaxy after May, and Wilfried Bony’s impending £30million deal as another.

Yet there remains a few that should be looking for the exit door themselves. West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino, Newcastle United’s Moussa Sissoko and West Ham’s Winston Reid are among those, and here’s why they ought to leave.

Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion

Interested clubs: Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur

Price: £20m

Super stat: West Brom would be joint-bottom of the Premier League without Berahino's goals

West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been linked with a move away from The Hawthorns

Berahino did not look too pleased at scoring four goals past Gateshead in the FA Cup 

2,723 - percentage increase in wages since 2013 if he accepts £24,000 a week

4 - points directly earned via his eight Premier League goals

4 - goals against Gateshead during 7-0 FA Cup win

187 - minutes-per-goal ratio

20 - West Brom’s only player to have played in every Premier League game 

Four goals against Gateshead and not so much as a smirk. Magic of the FA Cup...

Berahino’s dismantling of the Conference club was overshadowed by the 21-year-old’s refusal to celebrate, to smile, to show a smidgen of happiness for doing the job he is paid £12,000 per week to do.

Sportsmail’s Ian Ladyman last week coined the phrase ‘to do a Berahino’, which involves scoring, whether during a five-a-side match or on the playground, and sulking. It may catch on at The Hawthorns if the England Under-21 international doesn’t leave.

His poker face could be interpreted as a cry for help; a come and get me for potential suitors, those being Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.

But £20m? Was that plucked from thin air by West Brom, or created by agents after their 10 per cent? Neither.

New Baggies manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Berahino 

Berahino’s significance is outlined by the fact West Brom would be joint-bottom of the Premier League without him; his eight goals, one every 187 minutes on average, have directly contributed four points.

He is the only player to have featured in every Premier League game (20) for West Brom, and was named in Roy Hodgson’s England squad for the first time in November, too.

Against West Ham on New Year’s Day, before his four goals against Gateshead, he scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw and held a 100 per cent pass succession.

Perhaps the £12,000 is where the problem lies. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace wants to double it, meaning his wages would have increased by 2,723 per cent since December 2013, when he was on £850 per week.

Yet he seems unsatisfied. He’s turned up late for three matches this season, the latest against Manchester City on Boxing Day, and had to pay fines for his tardiness. Time to go, Berahino.

Moussa Sissoko, Newcastle United

Interested clubs: Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain

Price: £20m

Super stat: Sissoko is the Premier League’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph 

Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is the fastest player in the Premier League

35.3 - Sissoko’s kph clocked speed (the fastest in the Premier League)

101 - dribbles attempted, the seventh most in the Premier League

22 - chances created for Newcastle with two goals and one assist

967 - minutes played against PSG in Ligue 1 with Toulouse

The Mike Ashley model. Buy cheap, then sell for profit. It works for Sports Direct, but not for Newcastle United.

In Sissoko the owner has another piece of merchandise he can staple a £20m price tag to and put on the shelves for the January sales.

Ashley has a knack for selling his most valuable player. Andy Carroll (£35m) being one, Yohan Cabaye (£23m) another, arguably Demba Ba (£7.5m) and Mathieu Debuchy (£10m), too.

Right on cue are serious concerns about another MVP being sold. Alan Pardew, in one of his final acts as manager, admitted Newcastle would be ‘vulnerable’ if a big club came knocking.

There have been reports Newcastle issued a ‘hands off’ warning to Paris Saint-Germain. In fact the club told them they’d have to pay handsomely. There’s a difference.

‘I have ambition,’ Sissoko previously said. ‘My goal is to play at the best clubs, playing the Champions League, win trophies, but today I am a Magpie and I am very happy.’

That was in December. Come January Newcastle are 10th, out of the FA Cup and Capital One Cup, without a manager, and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge are next.

So, what would Sissoko leave behind? The 25-year-old has been named the Premier League’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph against Leicester City, beating Raheem Sterling (35) and Alexis Sanchez (34.6), among others.

He has attempted 101 dribbles, placing him seventh in the top 10, two goals, one assist, and has created 22 chances.

If Sissoko feels he can bring all this to European football, then that lies away from St James’ Park. 

The 25-year-old has been linked with a move to Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain

Winston Reid, West Ham

Interested clubs: Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham

Price: £4m

Super stat: Reid has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186) 

West Ham may choose to cash in on Winston Reid or risk losing him for free at the end of the season

75 - per cent of winning tackles

186 - clearances (the third-most in the Premier League)

115 - headed clearances

22 - clean sheets with Reid involved out of 29

It’s a timing thing. Let Reid leave now, get £4m. Let him leave in the summer, get nothing.

His contract expires on June 30 and, because he is stalling negotiations, Reid will be free to go where he pleases in less than six months. If West Ham are to make money, it’s time to sell.

They’re looking less likely to steal a Champions League place, having taken one point from nine against West Brom, Arsenal and Chelsea. Next up, Swansea City at the Liberty.

Arsene Wenger, so keen on Reid, has sent scouts to every West Ham game since November to watch the New Zealand captain.

The 26-year-old wouldn’t dominate headlines, nor break the bank with the £60,000-per-week wages he is supposedly demanding, but can give defensive cover for Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is said to be keen on bringing the New Zealand captain to the Emirates 

Sam Allardyce seems resigned to losing him, too. A one-liner or two from Big Sam:

Reid wins 75 per cent of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186). Of those, 115 were headed clearances. He has featured in 22 of West Ham’s 29 clean sheets over the past three seasons, is based in London, and has been since 2010.

• ‘There is no future for Winston Reid at West Ham at the moment. His contract finishes on June 30. He hasn’t said he’s going to sign or that he’s not going to sign.'

• ‘If he is not going to sign a contract [at West Ham], I find it highly unlikely if it is not already verbally done [elsewhere].’ 

Allardyce could and should cash in for something, rather than lose him for nothing.

AS FOR A LOAN DEAL...

Joel Campbell, Arsenal

Interested clubs: Real Sociedad, Villarreal

Price: Loan

Super stat: Campbell has made four league appearances for Arsenal, but 85 on loan for others

Arsenal striker Joel Campbell's proposed move to Real Sociedad could benefit all parties 

Lorient in 2011. Real Betis in 2012. Olympiacos in 2013. Now Real Sociedad?

How often can Wenger promise to make use of Campbell, only to give the 22-year-old a bit-part role to play? David Moyes can remedy that.

He wants Sociedad to become the fourth city to welcome Campbell from where he goes wasted. Moyes, after all, can offer time on the pitch; a luxury yet to be afforded in north London, despite Wenger’s assurances.

'I’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in Spain,’ said Moyes. ‘If there’s one market I know best at the moment then it’s the British market.'

Costa Rica international Campbell has failed to hold down a regular first team role at Arsenal

No prizes for who the man that recently thwarted Barcelona was referring to. Campbell, while open to signing a new contract with Arsenal, fancies the move, too.

Four Premier League appearances, 39 minutes total, zero goals, zero shots on or off target, two chances created. The love affair at Arsenal continues.

And so to the underdog story of the summer. The 2014 World Cup allowed Costa Rica, led by a seemingly unknown forward, to reach their first quarter-final in history.

It got Campbell noticed but Wenger has no time for sentimentality. Campbell’s next destination should be Sociedad, where he is likely to get more than a minute or two, here or there, every so often.
