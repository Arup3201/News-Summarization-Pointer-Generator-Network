She is one of the world's most iconic boats which for almost 40 years travelled the world's seas.

But following retirement in 2008, the much-loved Queen Elizabeth 2, known as the QE2, is now under threat of being broken up and sold for scrap.

However, an ambitious multi-million pound scheme has now emerged to save the boat by permanently moving it to London and opening it as a plush hotel on the River Thames.

The vessel is currently based in Dubai and its owners are said to be in talks with China about stripping it for scrap metal. But it is hoped that this can be prevented by moving the ship to London and transforming it into a luxury hotel.

Base: She would be stationed at Carlsberg Wharf, opposite the O2 Arena, in London

She would be stationed at Carlsberg 
Wharf - opposite the O2 Arena, and near the Emirates Cable Car, Excel 
Conference Centre, and Canary Wharf.

If
approved, the ambitious multi-million pound scheme would save the 
retired ship from the threat of being broken up and sold for scrap.

The Mayor of London's office have been informed of the plans and Government ministers have been urged to back them.

Shipping expert Martin Cox, who runs the website Maritime Matters, said a reception building and walkway would be built on the riverside.

Position: The boat would be located on the opposite side of this bank

Arrival: The Queen Elizabeth 2 is escorted by the UAE coast guard as she arrives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates following her retirement in 2008

And the five star development could even house a decommissioned Concorde aeroplane.

He
said: 'Recent correspondence with the Mayor of London's office and 
other related UK sources illuminated a fully realised vision for QE2's 
next era on the River Thames.

'Phase
One would see the whole area of Carlsberg Wharf demolished, replacing 
it with parking, a reception building and a walkway to the ship.

'Phase Two would include the construction of additional commercial visitor attraction buildings, and possibly incorporate the supersonic Concorde plane.

'Of the original passenger accommodation, it is intended to use the 330 first class cabins and 250 of the larger tourist cabins for the hotel.'

The QE2 spent 39 years carrying passengers around the world in luxury after she was launched by cruise firm Cunard in 1969.

She left her home port of Southampton for the last time in November 2008, sailing to Dubai.She was due to open as an international tourist attraction but development stalled as the global recession took hold and she has not moved since.

The ship's Dubai owners are now said to be in talks with China about stripping it for scrap metal.

Former owner Cunard has cast doubt on the reports - but fans of the legendary liner fear for her future.

Almost 1,000 people have already signed an official e-petition urging the Government to support the 'QE2 London' project.

It would be an expensive operation because the QE2 is unlikely to be able to make the voyage from Dubai under her own power after a long lay-up.

QE2 would be loaded with enough ballast to sit on the tidal river bed and open as a five-star hotel with tours for the public.

The QE2 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of Southampton and New York.

Operated by Cunard, she began an almost 40 year career in 1969 and served as the flagship of the line until succeeded by RMS Queen Mary 2 in 2004.

During her years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and was known as being the height of glamour.

Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and also captured the imagination of those less affluent,who were blocked by stairways and elevators from entering first-class spaces even for a peek.

Passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top-name show-biz stars entertained.

In May 1982 she even took part in the Falklands War, carrying 3000 troops and 650 volunteer crews.

This involved her being refitted with three helicopter pads, dormitories and fuel pipes to allow for refuelling at sea.

Incredibly, more than 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage to transport the members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade.

The vessel returned to the UK in June 1982 and was greeted in Southampton by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.
