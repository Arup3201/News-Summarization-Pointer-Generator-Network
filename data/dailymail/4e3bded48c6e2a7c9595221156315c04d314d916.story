The discovery of King Richard III’s remains in a car park may have been out of this world, but a new exhibition has been accused of making him look as if he comes from another planet.

Experts are outraged that organisers at the Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester have painted a copy of the King’s armour white, saying it makes him look like a Star Wars stormtrooper.

Members of the team who helped trace the skeleton have also branded an image of Richard lying in his grave as ‘grotesque’, saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead.

Annette Carson said she and the Looking for Richard Project team were ‘saddened and profoundly disappointed by the exhibition’ at the £4m Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester, which opened at the weekend.

Ms Carson, author of ‘Richard III: The Maligned King’, wrote: ‘Other grotesque exhibits include the white-painted depiction of the king’s armour resembling a stormtrooper from Star Wars, despite representatives of the council and university having attended the presentation by Dr Tobias Capwell in March 2013 where he described his armour and illustrated its actual probable appearance.

‘As an example of the organisers’ taste in these matters, it was only by strenuous insistence that we removed the planned visual which was to greet visitors: the central throne was to be drenched in a sickening pool of blood which dropped down to form words written in blood on the floor below.’

Academics say that staff at the new Richard III Visitor Centre were given a presentation on how the armour would probably have looked, but chose to ignore that advice

Annette Carson, who is part of the team who helped track down the remains, says that alongside the armour there were plans for a blood-soaked throne in the exhibit, but it was removed after her team insisted

She said about the imagery of the dead body: ‘We know this will be devastating not only to those who had trusted that the discovery of Richard’s remains would be conducted with dignity, but indeed to all civilised visitors who believe in the concept of respect for the dead.’

Ms Carson said the exhibition sidelined the efforts of the team which found the remains ‘despite years of research and ground-breaking discoveries’.

It also ‘misses out crucial details about original commissioning, funding and work’.

The attraction allows visitors to see below their feet to the spot where the king was found by archaeologists in 2012.

Miss Carson has also objected to a projection of Richard's body as it would have appeared in his grave, branding it 'grotesque' and saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead

The exhibit also features a 3D printed model of Richard III's skeleton which shows his infamous curved spine and evidence of the wound that killed him at the Battle of Bosworth

Since Richard's body was discovered buried underneath a car park in September 2012, his remains and legacy have proved highly controversial.

Arguments immediately broke out over where he would be reburied, with his descendants claiming his body should be laid to rest in York Minster, in accordance with his own wishes.

However High Court judges have now ruled that his skeleton should remain in Leicester, where it was taken by soldiers loyal to victorious Henry VII.

The skeleton is due to be sealed in a locked tomb at Leicester Cathedral next year. 

In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken in a city council car park using ground-penetrating radar on the site once occupied by Greyfriars church.

The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III.

The skeleton of the last of the Plantagenet kings was identified by DNA analysis after researchers traced his living descendants. 

Richard III was discovered in 2012 beneath a car park

Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. 

During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared.

Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

Supporters of the new king took Richard's body to Leicester where it was buried without pomp or ceremony in the churchyard of Greyfriars.

The exact location of the skeleton was lost to the ages until a team from Leicester University, using ground-penetrating radar, discovered it beneath a council car park.

The remains were dug out in September 2012, and in February the following year were confirmed to be Richard after DNA analysis.

Next year the skeleton will be taken to Leicester Cathedral where it will be locked away in a sealed tomb.
