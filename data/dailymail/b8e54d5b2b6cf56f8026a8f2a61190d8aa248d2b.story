Arsenal are giving serious consideration to a £6million move for Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy.

Arsene Wenger wants a new keeper to push current No.1 Wojciech Szczesny all the way next season. 

The Gunners have been alerted to Ruddy's potential availability ahead of next season and Sportsmail understands there is a strong willingness from the Emirates Stadium to pursue a move for the England international.

Premier League return? Arsenal are interested in Norwich keeper John Ruddy who is available for £6m

Target: Cardiff City stopper David Marshall is an alternative as Arsene Wenger eyes a new No 2

Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy has 
also been identified as a possible candidate to replace outgoing second 
choice keeper Lukasz Fabianski.

But Ruddy's extensive top-flight experience puts him ahead of McCarthy.

Cardiff
 keeper David Marshall has also been watched, but his £15million price 
tag could prove a stumbling block towards a potential move to the north 
London.
