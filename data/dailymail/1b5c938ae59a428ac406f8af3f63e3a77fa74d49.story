A mystery shopper has boasted on social media about putting stickers on halal products in his local Woolworths that claim they are 'possibly funding terrorism'.

The man posted two pictures of the sticker underneath bottles of tomato sauce and chocolate eggs inside a Woolworths in Beerwah, in Queensland's Glasshouse Mountains region.

With the photos, he wrote on the Boycott Halal in Australia page on Facebook: 'Doing our bit to help boycott halal certification.

A mystery shopper boasted about the labels, which read 'This product is halal certified (possibly funding terrorism',  on an anti-halal Facebook page

'Just spent about an hour placing these notes at our local Woolworths. Marked about 100 products. Funny how most of them were on special.'

The stickers read: 'This product is halal certified (possibly funding terrorism).' 

It was brought to the attention of the supermarket giant by Boycott Halal in Australia? No Way, according to the Sunshine Coast Daily

According to the pro-halal Facebook group's page, the stickers have been removed and the store manager now has the name of the person who placed them on the shelf.

This comes after claims from Kiralee Smith started up a campaign aiming to uncover the truth about Islam and major food companies

The post on Boycott Halal in Australia has since been removed. 

Beerwah Police said they had not been contacted about the incident.

This comes after claims from an Australian housewife who believes she discovered 'deception and corruption' within the food industry and started up a campaign aiming to uncover the truth about the relationship between Islam and some of Australia's major food companies.

Kirralie Smith was concerned Australians were unknowingly funding Islamic bodies every time they do the grocery shopping.

She wants full disclosure from food companies so Aussie shoppers can make informed decisions about whether to buy from companies who are allegedly giving funds to Islamic organisations.

Ms Smith, who is the director and founder of ‘Halal Choices', has made a shopping guide to inform shoppers about which companies are 'Halal Certified', which means their foods are appropriate for Muslims to consume.

She also called for an investigation of these Australian organisations, alleging that the international counterparts of the Islamic bodies were found using the proceeds to fund terrorism. 

Woolworths has been contacted by Daily Mail Australia in relation to this matter.

But a spokesman for the supermarket told APN Woolworths wanted to give customers value for money as well as a extensive range of products to choose from when shopping.

'No Woolworths own brand product, be it Homebrand, Select, Gold or Macro is Halal certified and we pay no Halal certification fees as a result,' the spokesman said.
