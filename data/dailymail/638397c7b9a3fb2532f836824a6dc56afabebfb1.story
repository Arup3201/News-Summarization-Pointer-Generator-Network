It seemed the perfect act of revenge - a jilted lover cruelly tattooed a picture of flies over excrement on his ex-girlfriend's back and the photo swept the internet.

But MailOnline can reveal all is not quite as it seems with the story of 'Rossie Brovent's poo tattoo'.

The resident of Dayton, Ohio, was reportedly suing her ex-boyfriend and tattoo artist Ryan Fitzjerald for $100,000 over the drawing which she eventually found out was of flies over a pile of excrement.

Tall story? This photograph of a woman with a pile of excrement tattooed on her back was claimed to be Rossie Brovent of Ohio - but it is sourced from a Polish website

He was said to be angry at her for 
cheating on him with a friend and plied her with alcohol before she 
signed a consent form agreeing a design ‘at the artist's discretion’. 
She wanted an image of Narnia.

But the story itself - originally reported on the VeryWeirdNews website and later followed up by British newspaper The Sun, U.S. website Metro and others across the world - has been thrown into doubt.

The picture of the ‘tattoo’ appeared on the Ugliest Tattoos blog, part of the Fail Blog group of websites, as far back as December 2009, MailOnline can reveal.

It was sourced from Polish social network website Nasza-klasa, which translates as ‘our class’, and the caption on the photo lists the month in Polish as January, without a year, and the name of ‘Ania’.

A court official at Dayton Municipal Court, where the lawsuit would most likely have been filed, told MailOnline they had no record of either Ms Brovent or Mr Fitzjerald in their records system.

Is it real? The story itself - which was originally reported on VeryWeirdNews and later followed up by newspapers and website across the world - has been thrown into doubt

A search of that court's database and of those of the surrounding civil courts by MailOnline also threw up no matches for either the defendant or plaintiff.

In addition the Smoking Gun website reported that a spokesman for Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, which covers the Dayton area, said he did not know about the reported lawsuit.

'I was passed out for most of the time, and woke up to this horrible image on my back'

What Rossie Brovent is quoted as saying

In the VeryWeirdNews article from November 21, Ms Brovent is quoted. But no contact address, email or phone number is listed for the website.

‘He tricked me by drinking a bottle of cheap wine with me and doing tequila shots before I signed it and got the tattoo,' she is quoted as saying.

‘Actually I was passed out for most of the time, and woke up to this horrible image on my back.’

The photo has gone viral since it was picked up by the mainstream media, but it now appears the image has been floating around blogs for years and there is no civil lawsuit as has been reported.
