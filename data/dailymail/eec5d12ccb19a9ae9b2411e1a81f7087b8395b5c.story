Katie Holmes and daughter Suri Cruise were involved in a minor car collision in New York City last night, it has been claimed.

Pictures were circulated of a black Mercedes sedan - believed to belong to Ms Holmes - after it had been hit by a sanitation truck on Monday evening.

It was reported that earlier the car had picked the pair from 
Manhattan's Chelsea Piers,  where six-year-old Suri takes gymnastics

Pacific Coast News and 
X17Online, who captured pictures at the scene, reported that Katie and Suri were involved 
in the collision.

Wrecked: A Mercedes S550, believed to have been 
chauffeuring Katie Holmes and daughter Suri, was struck by a sanitation 
truck in New York City Monday evening, according to reports

However, no one was reported hurt in the incident.

Police arrived to the scene and documented the damage on the S550, which sustained a large dent and several scratches to the rear driver side panel.

It appeared the Volvo dump truck - 
from Classic Santitation Recycling New York Corp - had backed into the luxury vehicle.

Katie and Suri were not seen at the 
scene of the accident. It was unclear if the actress and her daughter 
were in the vehicle when the incident occurred.

However, drivers of the Mercedes and sanitation truck were seen talking to authorities.

Police were unable to confirm a report of the accident when contacted by MailOnline. 

A spokesman for Classic Sanitation Recycling New York Corp, based in Clifton, New Jersey, was not available for comment.

Katie, 33, earlier in the day was 
pictured with Suri in the area, after bringing her to one of the many 
athletics classes held at Chelsea Piers.

Holding Suri's hand, the pair were 
trailed by the Dawson's Creek star's security detail as they made their 
way through the garage. 

The actress has been seen daily 
taking Suri around town to see friends, shop and take gymnastics classes 
at Chelsea Piers since Katie last month announced her shock divorce from
husband Tom Cruise.

The actors, who married in Italy in 
2006, settled their divorce proceedings last week after speedy 
negotiations between their teams of lawyers. 

Katie is thought to have won primary custody of Suri, who will remain with her in New York where they currently reside. But Tom has been unable to see their daughter as he has been at work completing filming on his new movie Oblivion.

Katie meanwhile is believed to have enrolled 
Suri at the prestigious Convent of the Sacred Heart School, an Upper 
East Side all-girls Catholic school, where she is expected to attend 
classes in the fall.

Their little girl: Katie is believed to have won sole custody of Suri in their divorce settlement

The school has an impressive list of alumnae, including Caroline Kennedy, actress Jordana 
Brewster, Lady Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, and Paris and Nicky 
Hilton.

Although the actress is reported to have 
sole custody of Suri as part of the settlement agreement, Tom is said to
have substantial visitation rights.

Sources have told TMZ Tom will pay 'more than $10 million' in child support for Suri until she is 18.

Speaking about their split, the 
former couple released a joint statement affirming their commitment to 
their daughter: 'We are committed to working together as parents to 
accomplish what is in our daughter Suri's best interests.

'We want to keep matters affecting 
our family private and express our respect for each other's commitment 
to each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as 
parents,' it read.

Meanwhile, it has been claimed that Suri has been keeping in touch with her father Tom Cruise via video chat.

The actor recently wrapped filming on
Oblivion in California, and is expected to see his 
daughter 'very soon', according to his lawyer, Bert Fields.

The 50-year-old actor also has two children from his marriage to Nicole Kidman - Isabella, 19, and 17-year-old Connor - who was seen boarding an airplane with his dad - presumably for New York - at the weekend.
