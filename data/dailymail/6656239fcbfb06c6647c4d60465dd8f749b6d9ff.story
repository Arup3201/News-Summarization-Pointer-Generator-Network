If Emmanuel Adebayor is right and Tottenham’s poor little players are scared to play at White Hart Lane, then Daniel Levy needs to get them up the M1 to Milton Keynes as soon as possible.

Adebayor’s comments are laughable and epitomise one of the biggest problems at Tottenham Hotspur.

Players join Spurs for an easy ride, a quiet life. It’s been happening for years.

Tottenham supporters will tell you with joy in their heart about some of the greats who they’ve seen wear the shirt. It’s not a criticism of them, but Spurs fans have been far too easily pleased over the years. They should demand more.

When Jurgen Klinsmann scored a few and showed everyone his hilarious diving celebration he became a legend.

Gareth Bale was brilliant, and so was Luka Modric.

Gazza, Waddle, Hoddle and Ardiles. Class acts.

Gary Lineker – what a finisher! How about David Ginola? And Teddy Sheringham?

Some great players, but not one league title at Tottenham for any of them.

And yet they’re all regarded as Spurs greats.

Players know that they don’t have to do too much to become a club legend at White Hart Lane. Some of them don’t even have to win any sort of trophy.

And so when Tottenham fans display their frustration at the ineptitude of the current team – they’ve lost four of their last five home games in the Premier League – Adebayor starts crying.

He claims to be speaking on behalf of the players so we are left to assume that all the players are upset about it, the poor lambs.

Adebayor is a player who didn’t even start on Sunday because he was so useless in the previous game, and when he was due to come on as a substitute he wasn’t ready.

And yet he is upset that the fans are expressing their unhappiness.

Spurs haven’t won the league title for well more than 50 years.

They’re meant to be a cup team but haven’t won the FA Cup for more than 20 years.

They have had one season in the Champions League.

The support of the fans has been brilliant in that time, but the side effect is that players and board members have all realised they only have to do the bare minimum, and they’ll either be seen as heroes or the manager will be sacked.

There is no accountability at Spurs.

There is, however, a culture and history of underachieving. And a habit of getting some crucial decisions badly wrong.

Tottenham supporters have had to live in the shadow of Arsenal for too long. Even now when the Gunners are as bad as they’ve been under Arsene Wenger, Spurs are still some way behind. That must hurt Spurs fans, and I feel for them.

But it’s up to the Tottenham faithful to mobilise themselves and ask serious questions.

The fans are the true owners of the club: Lewis, Pochettino, Baldini, Levy, Adebayor and all the rest will come and go. Generations of fans will be there for ever.

Now is the time for Spurs fans to ask what the club identity really is and in which direction it is going.

They need to stop at nothing to find out what the ultimate goal of the club is, and how they plan to get there. Or are Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy happy to just stay in the Premier League and pretend to challenge?

Get some answers Spurs fans. Otherwise you’ll end up in Milton Keynes questioning your status as a big club.

Booing the players is short term and ineffective. Adebayor’s empty tears are just a distraction from the real issues at this underachieving club. Massive issues.
