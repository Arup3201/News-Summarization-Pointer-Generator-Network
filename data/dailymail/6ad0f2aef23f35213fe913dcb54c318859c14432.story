A 300-foot cellphone tower in West Virginia collapsed Saturday and minutes later a smaller tower fell, killing two contractors and a firefighter, authorities said.

The contractors Kyle Kirkpatrick, 32, from Hulbert Oklahoma and Terry Lee Richard, Jr, from Bokoshe, Oklahoma were tethered to the larger tower when it collapsed in Clarksburg, killing them, State Police Corporal Mark Waggamon said.

Nutter Fort Fire Department firefighter 28-year-old Michael Dale Garrett, of Clarksburg, was killed when he was walking from his vehicle to the scene.

Two other contractors working on the larger tower were hurt and taken to a hospital. Waggamon described their injuries as serious but not life-threatening.

Waggamon said three of the workers were more than 60 feet up on the tower. One of those workers was killed along with a co-worker who was about 20 feet up when the tower toppled.

Two other workers at the site were not injured.

Waggamon said the weight of the collapsed tower put stress on guide wires to the smaller tower.

The crew was doing maintenance to strengthen the tower's support when the accident occurred, Waggamon said. He said the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration will investigate.

The towers are owned by SBA 
Communications, which hired workers from S&S Communications to 
remove the tall tower's diagonal supports and replace them with new 
ones.

'We
 are deeply saddened by the loss of life and the injuries to the other 
individuals and our prayers and concern go out to the families 
involved,' SBA Communications said in a statement to Metro News.

'SBA Communications is cooperating fully with any type of investigation being conducted by governmental agencies. We realize the sensitivity surrounding such an unexpected event and have mobilized our team to be on the scene to assist with any information needed.'

Steven Thompson, a member of the Summit Park Volunteer Fire Department, said about three dozen people from eight fire departments in the area responded.

Thompson said rescue personnel had to use four-wheel-drive and all-terrain vehicles because snow had made a mess of the gravel road leading to the site, which was on a ridge about 200 feet above a main road. He said the first crews still arrived 10 to 15 minutes after the call.
