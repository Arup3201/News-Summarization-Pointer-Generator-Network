Iraq has seen its fair share of violence in recent years - but the rape and murder of two young girls has provoked a fresh wave of shock and revulsion across the country.

The children, aged four and five, were kidnapped, 
repeatedly sexually assaulted and then bludgeoned to death in two separate incidents 
near the southern city of Basra.

The brutal crimes have struck a nerve, even in a nation that has seen a horrific amount of bloodshed during the past decade.

Killer: Akram al-Mayahi, has been convicted of raping and killing four-year-old Banin Haider in the town of Zubair, near Basra in Iraq

Horror: Four-year old Banin Haider (left) and Abeer Ali, 5 (right), were raped and murdered in separate incidents during a two-month period

Despite a conviction in one case, a 
handful of arrests in the other and beefed up police patrols in the 
city, families in Basra remain on edge following the murders of four-year-old Banin Haider and five-year-old Abeer Ali during a two-month period.

Many parents in and around the 
city will not let their children go to school alone or even play outside because of fears for their safety.

Others are making plans to 
leave Basra altogether, saying they have lost confidence in the security
forces' ability to keep children safe.

'These inhuman crimes make me think of
the safety of my children,' said Hazim Sharif, 38, a government 
employee and father of four. 'I do not trust the security forces any 
more. I have to protect my family by myself.'

To many in Iraq, the murders mark a 
new, more menacing type of violence than the country has previously 
encountered â€” at least in public.

Crime: A member of Zubair city council inspects a destroyed checkpoint building formerly belonging to the Iraqi army, where four-year old Banin Haider was raped and murdered

Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, is 
considerably safer than Baghdad, and the recent attacks are seen as a 
particularly dark spot on an otherwise relatively quiet and stable 
province.

The city of about 1 million and its surrounding province, 
which goes by the same name, is Iraq's main oil industry hub.

The region
is generally poorer and shabbier than the capital, but it is slowly 
beginning to flourish as international companies move in, attracted by 
the region's lucrative oil fields.

Banin was kidnapped on August 16 in Zubair,
a rundown town just outside the city of Basra. Her family, from the 
nearby province of Dhi Qar, had come to town to visit relatives.

Police later found her body in a 
derelict area with her hands and legs bound. She was raped multiple 
times, and her head was smashed by what was believed to be a large 
brick, according to authorities.

Fearful: Hazim Sharif escorts his daughters to school in Basra following the murders. Many parents in the area are now worried for their children's safety. (Neither Mr Sharif or his family have any connection with the crimes)

An off-duty soldier assigned to a 
nearby army base, Akram al-Mayahi, was arrested in connection with 
Banin's murder.

He was found guilty on October 22 and sentenced to death 
for abusing and killing the girl, said judge Jassim al-Moussawi, the 
spokesman for the Basra Federal Appeals Court.

Banin's family wants al-Mayahi to be 
executed publically at the scene of the crime as a deterrent, according to reports. The sentence has yet to be carried out.

The other young girl, Abeer, also came
from Dhi Qar province, a relatively poor part of Iraq that many 
residents travel from in search of work, often for weeks at a time.

She 
was abducted on October 11 while her family attended a wedding not far from 
the scene of Banin's murder.

Her body was found 12 hours later bearing similar signs of trauma to the previous victim, 
though Abeer was also strangled with a shoelace, officials said.

Industry: Many Iraqis travel to the oil-rich Basra area from other parts of the country to work in the lucrative oil industry

Authorities later determined that the 
suspected kidnapper phoned nine friends and invited them to take part in
the rape.

So far, eight people have been arrested and have confessed to the crime. 
The case has yet to go to trial because the investigation is still under
way.

Authorities believe the soldier convicted in Banin's killing is 
not connected to Abeer's murder.

'I cannot rest or sleep while these 
criminals are still eating, drinking and sleeping in prison. They should
be executed immediately,' said Abeer's father, Ali Abid, a 30-year-old 
construction worker and father of four other daughters.

'Iraq has become
like a jungle where monsters maul the bodies of the poor people.' Reports of the two cases have sent a wave of fear through the streets of Basra.

In an attempt to calm public opinion, security forces have started deploying more police patrols, particularly near schools.

Some officials blame a rise in drug 
use for the crimes, although many Basra residents see the focus on 
drugs as misplaced. They instead criticize Iraq's government and 
security forces for failing to provide adequate security.
