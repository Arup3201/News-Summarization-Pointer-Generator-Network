The Department of Defense is giving serious consideration to a move that would ban smoking on all military bases, and on naval ships around the world.

'I think we owe it to our people to review the military's tobacco sales policy,' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told surprised reporters during a Monday briefing.

The decision would stand in sharp contrast to iconic images of World War II doughboys and sailors at sea with cigarettes in their mouths, and Marines smoking celebratory cigars after successful missions.

Thinking about it: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will consider a broad effort to ban the sale of tobacco on military bases and naval vessels

Smoking has been a permitted pleasure, albeit an unhealthy one, for servicemen and women for as long as there has been a U.S. military, but that's set to change as Senate Democrats make a political move

Five U.S. senators, all Democrats, are urging Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to take the idea seriously and make naval stations and ships the first step in a larger military-wide change.

But at least one member of Congress, a Marine Corps veteran, is pushing back, calling it a 'personal decision' of fighting men and women.

'We urge you to do everything in your capacity to address this issue for our military men and women,' the five lawmakers wrote to Mabus on Monday, 'including moving forward with the proposal to stop the sale of tobacco aboard all naval bases and ships.'

The letter was signed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jack Reed of Rhode Island.

Citing a 2009 Defense Department report that estimated a $1.9 billion smoking-related cost in health expenses and lost productivity, they said the initiative would 'renew emphasis on the health of our dedicated sailors and Marines as well as provide for increased combat readiness.'

Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who joined the U.S. Marine Corps after the 9/11 terror attacks and served tours in Iraq in Afghanistan, objected.

'Overall, removing tobacco sales is perceived more as a political decision, intended to make a point, than it is a decision that supports our sailors and Marines – regardless of personal feelings on the individual and legal use of tobacco products,' he wrote to Mabus.

In its quest to maximize military readiness, Hunter said in his letter, 'the Navy should wo

rry less about intruding on the personal decision-making of these same sailors and Marines.'

Smoking rates have declined among active duty military personnel in recent years, due in part to an existing safety-related tobacco ban on submarines, and the Pentagon's provision of smoking-cessation services for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who want to kick the habit.

But in 2011, social scientists at the University of California San Francisco found that more than 30 percent of U.S. troops are smokers, compared to 20 percent of American civilians.

Naval bases ended a program in 2012 that offered cigarette discounts to on-base personnel. Navy base commissaries also no longer sell tobacco.

But the Post Exchanges run by the military – the famed 'Px's – derive 4.5 per cent of all their  sales from tobacco. In the Army and Air Force, that figure is 6 per cent.

Overall, the Pentagon reaps a $100 million windfall every year from tobacco profits, money that funds recreation programs on military bases and family support programs.

A March 14 Pentagon called for '[s]tructural reforms in how and where we allow tobacco purchases to be made, as well as the need to consider tobacco-free installations,' saying they were 'matters that require our near-term attention.

The memo came from Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jessica Wright, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Jonathan Woodson.

'The prominence of tobacco products in retail outlets and permission for smoking breaks while on duty sustain the perception that we are not serious about reducing the use of tobacco,' they wrote.

Any decision about forbidding tobacco sales on military bases and ships would have to be made at the highest levels of the Pentagon.

Technically possible, but difficult: Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines could still smoke, but they'll have to find another ay to buy cigarettes and cigars

Mabus told the paper last week that 'we demand that sailors and Marines be incredibly fit. We know tobacco hurts that fitness. We know the cost of health care far exceeds any profits we could possibly make selling that.'

He wrote in a 2012 memo that '[t]obacco use is the most avoidable public health hazard in the Navy and Marine Corps.'

That followed a 2009 Pentagon statement, issued early in the Obama administration, saying for the first time that it 'supports a smoke-free military and believes it is achievable.'

Representatives of Philip Morris International, a major cigarette producer, and a spokesman for the Cigar Rights of America lobby group, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
