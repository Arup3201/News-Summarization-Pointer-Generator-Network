He might be playing the most fantasised-about romantic hero created in recent years but there's plenty more to British star Jamie Dornan than whips and chains.

The 32-year-old former model plays the BDSM-loving billionaire with a high-flying business and penchant for canes and floggers in the much talked-about film version of Fifty Shades of Grey.

His character seduces literature student Anastasia Steele in the steamy story - but Dornan, who hails from County Down in Northern Ireland, has been getting women hot under the collar since his days as a a Calvin Klein model.

Nevertheless, his sexy role in Fifty Shades of Grey is set to catapult the model, actor and musician to dizzying heights of fame, but he's equally fond of gritty TV dramas.

He has been putting in a wonderfully creepy performance in BBC2 thriller The Fall since 2013, as gimlet-eyed serial killer Paul Spector alongside Gillian Anderson.

Along with his turn in The Fall and the film version of EL James' popular book, Dornan has been hitting TV screens in Channel 4's lush period drama, New Worlds.

Next, comes the role of Dr. Allan Pascal in an upcoming film The 9th Life of Louis Drax, a supernatural thriller which is based on a book of the same name.

Despite his acting success, Dornan's main focus is on his biggest role of all - that of father to his 15-month old daughter Dulcie with his actress turned singer wife Amelia Warner, also 32, whom he married in 2013.

In the years before Warner came onto the scene, the hunk spent much of his time splashed across billboards modelling for Calvin Klein alongside both Kate Moss and Eva Mendes, and starred in campaigns for Dior, Aquascutum and Armani among others.

He also spent a few years in an off-on relationship with Keira Knightley from 2003. The stunning couple were often pictured together at A-list parties and relaxing off duty.

When not squiring Knightly, Dornan attempted to forge a musical career, performing in the folk band Sons of Jim, until 2008, which supported Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall on tour.

Since acting success struck, his look has changed from baggy jeans and spiked hair to sophisticated gent, although he has always been incredibly handsome and able to pull off any style. As a result, in 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men.

In recent years Dornan has rarely seen without a beard, which adds to his manly, grown-up appeal. Speaking about his facial fuzz, he said: 'I feel uncomfortable without it. I find myself moving differently. I don’t like myself without a beard.'

Jamie's biggest television role so far was as the psychopathic Paul Spector, the murderer trying to escape detection in The Fall on BBC1

In  The Fall, which recently ended its second season, Jamie played the controlling father and husband playing cat and mouse with the police
