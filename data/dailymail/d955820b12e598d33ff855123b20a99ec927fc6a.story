Anger: Nazier Din was given a police caution even though he was the victim of a crime carried out by a vandal on his business

A
 businessman whose office was vandalised was arrested and hauled through
 the courts after he put up a poster branding the prime suspect a ‘dirty
 pervert drug dealing grass’.

Nazier Din, 44, was infuriated when police told him no one would be prosecuted for smashing his office window with a brick.

The name of the suspected culprit was handed to police but they said they could not press charges because of a lack of evidence.

So
 company director Mr Din put a large sign over the boarded-up window, 
which expressed his view of the suspect without naming him.

He
 was astonished when police said the suspect had complained  about the 
sign and warned him he could face arrest for public order offences for 
causing ‘distress and alarm’. 

So then he taped over the word ‘pervert’ and added a disclaimer apologising for any distress to  the public. 

But
 police were not satisfied and Mr Din was arrested and later charged 
with using threatening, abusive or insulting words – behaviour likely to
 cause harassment, alarm and distress. 

The
 father of two then faced two months of legal wrangling over the case in
 the courts  – and a £1,000 legal bill – before finally agreeing to  a 
police caution.

Last
 night Mr Din, from Bury, Greater Manchester, who has run a successful 
accident management and car hire firm for 12 years, condemned police and
 courts for failing to side with victims of crime.

He said he was appalled that the vandal, who caused £2,500 worth of damage, will face no punishment. 

And
 he claimed he put up the sign only after he had been repeatedly goaded 
by the individual he suspected of committing the crime in the first 
place.

He said: ‘I was treated like a common criminal and yet I was supposed to be the victim of crime. ‘Why did I have to go through the courts for two months? There was no name on the sign, so how could it cause any distress?

‘One complaint was made about the sign by a named person and two were anonymous.

'The
 first complaint made was by the man who I believe broke the window.  My
 solicitor asked the police why he wasn’t arrested when he made his 
complaint yet they said they couldn’t prove anything as he had made no 
admissions. 

‘What I can’t understand is why anyone would be angry about that sign unless they knew it was referring to them.

'Offensive': The person suspected of vandalising Mr Din's office subsequently complained to police after he put up this sign over the broken window

‘I never intended to offend anyone – if anything this was a joke at the expense of the vandal, and he wasn’t even named.

‘But I was arrested at my home in front of my wife by three detectives. It seems totally over the top.’ 

He
 added: ‘First and foremost, I would like to apologise if we caused any 
offence – because it was never our intention to do this.

'We wanted people to know that I was a victim of a crime and that the office had not shut down. 

‘We are hard-working people and I wouldn’t wish this on anybody. 

‘What I really want is for the vandal to be arrested for the criminal damage. I just want justice to be done.’ 

A
 spokesman for the Crown  Prosecution Service said that the evidence was
 thoroughly reviewed by a senior prosecutor and discussed with Greater 
Manchester Police before Mr Din was handed  a caution.
