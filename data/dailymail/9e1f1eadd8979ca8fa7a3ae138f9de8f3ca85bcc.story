A woman who was told she was too fat to have a baby has spoken of her joy after she lost 12 stone - and gave birth to triplets.

Kelly Hoyles, 36, endured 13 years of heartache after trying unsuccessfully to become pregnant since she married in 2000.

She tipped the scales at 29 stone but ignored warnings she was too obese to conceive. 

The healthcare support worker continued 
to try for a baby with husband Colin, 42, even though her size meant she
was not producing eggs.

Kelly Hoyles spent 12 years trying to conceive due to the fact she weighed 29 stone. After shedding 12 stone following gastric band surgery, she gave birth to triplets Freddie, Bella & Jack (l-r)

Mrs Hoyles says she was in denial about her weight and ignored medical warnings she was too obese to conceive

Mrs Hoyles eventually admitted she needed help and went to her doctor to ask for a gastric band in January 2008.

She underwent the operation on the NHS in November that year and shed an incredible 12 stone over the next three-and-a-half years.

A doctor gave her tablets to stimulate her ovaries last May and Mrs Hoyles was stunned when she became pregnant two months later in July.

The couple were then told they were having triplets at her eight-week scan.

After an uncomplicated pregnancy, 
Kelly gave birth to Freddie, Jack and Bella seven-and-a-half weeks early
on February 26 this year at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Freddie weighed 4lb 3oz, Jack weighed 4lb 4oz and Bella weighed 3lb 6oz.

Mrs Hoyles said: 'We had been trying for a baby since we got married in 2000. But I was so obese, I was nearly 29 stone at my biggest in 2003.

'I just ignored doctors who said I was too fat, I thought there was bigger people out there having babies.

'Then I hit my 30s and realised it probably was my weight. I had been in denial.

'I had the gastric band operation in November 2008 and I went back to the hospital in January last year and said I've lost all this weight.

'Everything came back clear except I wasn't ovulating, so I went on Clomid tablets which stimulate your ovaries.

'And two months later I fell pregnant. When I found out, I didn't believe it. I thought it was my body playing tricks on me.

'I did three tests and they all came back positive but I still couldn't believe it until my eight-week scan.

'It wasn't until I saw the pictures on the screen that I believed it. But then the sonographer turned around and said 'you're having triplets'. I can't repeat what I said. I was just in shock.'

The multiple births meant that Mrs Hoyles, from Boston, Lincolnshire, had to wait before she could properly meet her three new babies.

A doctor gave Mrs Hoyles tablets to stimulate her ovaries last May. The couple were delighted when they discovered they were having triplets Freddie, Jack and Bella at the eight-week scan

A lack of cots at the neo-natal unit in Nottingham meant one baby was whisked off to Sheffield while the other two were sent to Derby.

Mr Hoyles, who works as a night manager for a food supplier, spent time visiting the trio while his wife recovered.

Mrs Hoyles was eventually reunited with her babies when they were five-days-old and the family were allowed to go home exactly two weeks later. She added: 'It was quite traumatic for the first night. 

'I was taken into intensive care and lost two litres of blood. I had to have an emergency Caesarean as I got an infection.

'As they arrived early, there were not enough cots spare at the neo-natal unit to take them, so they were shipped off.

With the triplets now home, the couple now get through a staggering 140 nappies and 168 bottles of milk a week

'I met Bella and Jack for a matter of minutes before they were rushed away. I didn't get to meet Freddie for five days.

'The babies were home at just 19-days-old because they were doing so well.

'They are completely healthy, they are growing really well.

'It's still a bit surreal. I'm still shocked now. Sometimes I look at them and think I can't believe it.'Sometimes it feels like a mad house but they are a lot of fun.'

The triplets are now keeping the couple busy - with Kelly and Colin getting through a staggering 140 nappies a week.

They also use 24 bottles of milk each day, amounting to 168 bottles a week.
