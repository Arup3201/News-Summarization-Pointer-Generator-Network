Southampton have begun their rebuild under new manager Ronald Koeman by completing the signing of Dusan Tadic in a deal that could be worth up to £10.3million.

The Saints saw off reported late interest from Everton to complete the deal for the Serbian midfielder.

Tadic, 25, moves to St Mary’s from Dutch club FC Twente and his arrival at St Mary’s on a four-year contract is a huge boost to the south coast club following recent departures of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw, and strong interest from Liverpool in central defender Dejan Lovren.

Tadic said: 'It is a really nice feeling, this is a really nice club of which I have heard a lot of good things about. I have already seen the beautiful training centre and there are lots of nice people that work here including the coaches, so I am really happy to be here.'

Attacking midfielder Tadic, 25, scored some 16 times in 33 league games last season for Twente, as the Dutch side finished third behind Ajax and Feyenoord.

Tadic is confident he has joined a club going places under Koeman, who impressed while in charge of Feyenoord in the Eredivisie.

'I watched a lot of the games last season and saw that the club plays really nice football which will suit me because I like to play in the same way,' he added.

'The manager obviously knows me from the Dutch league so when he called me and told me his plan it was an easy decision to make.

'I know the manager well because he is one of the biggest Dutch legends in football, everyone knows him.

'He is a really good coach and you can always expect his teams to play well because he is leading them and because he is so good tactically. I am really excited to start playing for the club.'

Koeman made Tadic one of his leading targets shortly after succeeding Mauricio Pochettino as Saints manager.

He will be a natural replacement for left-sided Lallana who joined Liverpool in a £25million deal shortly after England’s exit from the World Cup.

Tadic has played in Holland since 2010 after starting his  career in his native Serbia.

He played for Groningen before signing for Twente, who finished third in the Dutch league and Tadic’s reputation soared as a player who can create as well as score goals.
