Kate McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine was abducted in Portugal in 2007, has spoken about being the target of internet abuse for taking part in the Virgin London Marathon this Sunday.

Speaking on ITV's Daybreak this morning, McCann, 45, who has been training to run in aid of the charity Missing People, an organisation which offers a lifeline of support when someone disappears, said she believes more needs to be done to tackle online trolls.

Under a link on Facebook about McCann 
doing the Marathon someone wrote: 'Well I am going to, Anyone got a Gun?
 BBBangggggg? (sic)'. Police are looking in to who made the threat.

She told Daybreak: 'We have obviously had a lot of abuse over the last six years, so in some ways it's nothing new. I think we tend to get a little bit blasé, which is wrong because you shouldn't do because it's bad.'

McCann continued: 'It is internet abuse and we both feel really strongly that more should be done about internet abuse. People wouldn't get away with behaving like that in the street and yet they feel like they can hide behind a computer at home.'

Kate, speaking on Daybreak this morning, said she and her husband Gerry feel strongly that something should be done to prevent people being targeted by internet abuse

McCann, who also has eight-year-old twins Amelie and Sean with her husband Gerry,  continued: 'We do have children. Even sometimes when I do think they're cowards and I'm not even going to go there, then I think about my children and I think it's not right that they should come across stuff like that as well.'

Speaking to presenters Lorraine Kelly and John Stapleton, the mother-of-three revealed she plans to go ahead with the marathon, despite some recent knock-backs to her health. She explained: 'It's been quite a slog and I think anybody who attempts a marathon knows there's a lot of training involved.

'And it's gone well really until the last five weeks. I've got a couple of problems, I've had a recurrent Achilles tendon problems... and I’ve also got a problem with the joint in my left foot.'
