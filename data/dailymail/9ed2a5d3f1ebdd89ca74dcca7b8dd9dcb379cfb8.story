Harriet Harman pulled out of  a keynote speech yesterday as the controversy raged over her alleged links to a paedophile group.

The Labour deputy leader had been expected to make the closing speech at a special party conference called to approve Ed Miliband’s bid to reforge the party’s relationship with the trade unions.

She sat on the conference platform but failed to speak and Mr Miliband ended up addressing the packed event twice.

Silent partner: Harriet Harman next to Ed Miliband at the conference yesterday

The conference overwhelmingly backed Mr Miliband’s plans for a new ‘one member, one vote’ party leadership election system and an end to union members being automatically ‘affiliated’ to Labour.

Miss Harman’s silence took the gloss off Labour’s announcement last night that ex-Foreign Secretary David Owen, who famously turned his back on the party in 1981 to form the SDP, was once more backing Labour after yesterday’s move.

Lord Owen praised Mr Miliband for a ‘brave and bold reform’ and said he had made a donation of more than £7,500 to the party, although he stopped short of rejoining.

The rule change came amid mounting pressure on Miss Harman, former legal officer for the National Council For Civil Liberties, to apologise over its connections with a vile group that campaigned to legalise sex with children.

A senior civil servant who worked under former Labour  Home Secretary Merlyn Rees is  at the centre of an investigation  into whether Government  money was used to fund the Paedophile Information  Exchange group.Clifford Hindley was assistant secretary in charge of the Home Office’s Voluntary Services  Unit which, it is alleged,  funnelled tens of thousands of pounds to the PIE.

A Mail on Sunday investigation has uncovered that lifelong bachelor Hindley, a former Methodist minister who died in 2006, is the focus of a Home  Office inquiry over claims that large sums were given to the group in grants.

After leaving the Home Office, Hindley wrote a paper arguing that the age of consent for homosexuals should be lowered in line with heterosexuals and another on homosexuality in classical Athens, looking at relationships between men and under-age boys.

The shocking allegations were first revealed by this paper last year, as Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill, launched an urgent investigation.

That investigation is now  believed to be considering claims that tens of thousands of pounds  of taxpayers’ money could have been channelled by Hindley and the VSU to the PIE, mostly while Merlyn Rees was Home Secretary between 1976 and 1979.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the allegations  and the permanent secretary has commissioned a thorough, independent investigation.’

Miss Harman, who worked for  the NCCL
 from 1978 to 1982, has expressed ‘regret’ over its links  to the 
Paedophile Information Exchange but refused to apologise.

She arrived at the Labour 
conference at London’s Excel Centre with husband and fellow Labour MP  
Jack Dromey.

He also faces questions over his role in the civil rights 
group, to which the Paedophile Information Exchange was affiliated from 
1975 to 1983.

Miss Harman, who sat next to Mr Miliband, had been expected to round up the debate with a traditional rousing speech.

Her place was taken by Labour MP Jon Ashworth while Mr Miliband’s second speech closed the event.

Last night, a spokeswoman for Miss Harman said her participation had never been set in stone.

She said: ‘It was never fixed.’

The programme change came  as many Labour MPs continue to express private anger over Miss Harman’s handling of the NCCL row.

She has insisted she ‘never had anything to do with PIE’ and that she is the victim of a ‘politically motivated smear campaign’.

But she was left isolated when former Labour government colleague Patricia Hewitt, who was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974 to 1983, last week admitted  it had been ‘naive and wrong’ in its dealings with PIE.

Mr Dromey, an NCCL executive committee member in the 1970s, has denied claims he did not do enough to try to expel the paedophile group and insists he challenged PIE at the council’s 1976 conference.

Mr Miliband has made reforming the party’s trade union links a litmus test of his leadership, even though he won the 2010 contest largely thanks to union support.

The changes, sparked by the alleged rigging of a party candidate selection by the Unite union in Falkirk, mean the next Labour leader will be elected by a one member, one vote system, rather than through the electoral college in which unions have a third of the vote.

And instead of being automatically affiliated to Labour, union members will in future be invited to opt in as a party supporter for £3.

Delegates backed the plans, with 86 per cent voting in favour.

Len McCluskey, boss of the giant Unite union, expressed defiance saying the changes would not mean the end of union influence over Labour. ‘This is our party and we are going nowhere,’ he said.

Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges writes Miliband hoped the conference would be his 'Clause 4 moment'

Ed Miliband had hoped yesterday’s Labour special conference would prove to be his Clause 4 moment. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out like that. He gave quite a good speech about getting people to re-engage with the political process. There was some decent mocking of Cameron’s attempt to rebrand himself leader of ‘the Worker’s Party’.

But although he managed to put a brave face on it, yesterday was the day Labour’s leader marched his troops to the top of the hill and then marched them swiftly back down again. Or, more accurately, it was the day he marched his troops to the top of the hill and then allowed Unite leader Len McCluskey to march them back down to the ExCeL centre in London’s Docklands.

In the ExCeL’s Platinum Suite 2 there was a sense of being at a rather low-key motivational conference. Or a slightly more upbeat humanist wedding. Somewhere on the road to Docklands, Ed has managed to lose his way. And it’s worth remembering where the journey began. In the aftermath of the Falkirk scandal – where Unite was found to have attempted to rig the candidate selection for the safe Labour seat – an enraged Miliband threw down the gauntlet to the unions.

They had been practising what he called: ‘A politics that was closed.  A politics of the machine. A politics that is rightly hated.’

Turning his fire directly on Unite’s leader, he ratcheted up the rhetoric: ‘Instead of defending what happened in Falkirk, [Len] McCluskey should be facing up to his responsibilities. He should not be defending the machine politics involving bad practice and malpractice that went on there, he should be facing up to it.’

Then Miliband set out his terms. The union’s financial stranglehold on his party would finally have to be broken. Trade union members would have to make a conscious decision to sign up directly to Labour, by-passing the general secretaries. And he would bring an end to the days when those general secretaries could spend limitless sums endorsing the leadership campaigns of their favoured candidates.

This was all combative, indeed, historic stuff. But rather than drive forward with his reforms – as Blair, Smith and Kinnock did – Miliband has engaged in a series of subtle, and not so subtle, tactical retreats.The funding proposals will not now be implemented until 2018 or 2019. In other words, never.

The requirement to ask individual trade union members to ‘opt in’ to membership of the party has been placed in the hands of an ‘Implementation Group’ that will not report until some point towards the end of the year. And the spending cap on elections has been shelved all together.

Somewhere on the road to Docklands, Ed managed to lose his way - writes Dan Hodges, who attended the special conference

Even the commitment to introducing one member, one vote to leadership elections – the one significant move for which Miliband does deserve credit – is not all that it seems.

By abolishing the rights of his MPs to influence those elections, and knocking down the electoral college wall between ‘ordinary’ Labour party members and trade unionists, he has in effect increased the size of the votes in the control of the unions from 33 per cent to around 60 per cent.

All of which is why, when it came to the crunch, McCluskey raised the card containing his union’s mighty block vote and gave Miliband’s ‘reform’ plans a fair wind. Tellingly, Labour’s leader made no mention in either of his speeches to the events in Falkirk that had precipitated this special conference.

But, in an equally telling intervention, McCluskey did. ‘My union has done nothing wrong,’ he declared to loud cheers. Before pointedly adding: ‘This is our party and we are going nowhere.’

And he’s right. They’re not. Nor, for that matter, is Ed Miliband.

Yesterday was billed as the most historic constitutional turning point for Labour in almost a century. But it wasn’t. The fact is that as the Falkirk crisis swirled around him, Miliband panicked, and made a series of commitments he was unable to deliver.

Everything since then has been an exercise in helping him extricate himself from the hook he’d clumsily impaled himself on.
