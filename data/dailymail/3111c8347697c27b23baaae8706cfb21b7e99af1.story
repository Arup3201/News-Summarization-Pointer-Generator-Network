Two lovers who beat a woman with a riding whip when they caught her trying to steal a wristwatch during a threesome have been locked up.

Aaron Samuels, 27, and Brooke Reid, 22, continued to pleasure each other as they took turns to torture the terrified 21-year-old victim during a two-hour ordeal.

Samuels had organised the romp on Facebook and invited mother-of-one Reid and the victim to his house in Barking, Essex.

But things turned ugly when the victim became jealous of the attention Reid and Samuels were paying each other, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Violence flared when Samuels - a youth worker with Barking and Dagenham Council - caught her trying to steal his watch.

He slapped her repeatedly around the face before forcing her against a CD rack, sending discs tumbling to the floor.

When she failed to replace them in the correct slots he slapped her again and held a baseball bat aloft over his trembling victim before Reid grabbed a screwdriver and threatened to stab her.

She then kicked and punched the woman before biting her on her face.

Samuels grabbed the whip and forced the victim to pull her jeans down before beating her on her back and buttocks.

Reid whipped her on her forearms before forcing vodka down her throat.

The woman eventually escaped and was found in a distressed state by a passer-by, who called the police.

She suffered two black eyes, numerous injuries to her face and bruising, as well as red marks on her back, buttocks and forearms.

In a victim impact statement, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she became depressed and lost her job as a result of the assault.

She struggles to sleep and has become distrustful of people outside her family.

At the time of the attack, on July 14 last year, Reid was subject to a one-year suspended sentence for unlawful wounding after she hurled a glass bottle in a woman's face at a nightclub on March 11 last year.

Samuels was jailed for 14 months while Reid received two years with an additional nine months for breaching the suspended sentence.

Sentencing, Judge Jacqueline Beech said: 'This was a joint enterprise and a nasty and demeaning attack.'

Addressing Reid, she added: 'It is clear you have a tendency towards violent behaviour towards young women and a propensity to cause harm to others.'

Samuels wept in the dock throughout the hearing while Reid laughed as the details of the attack were read out.

Edward Boateng-Addo, for Samuels, said the offences were out of character and his conviction has had a 'substantial impact' on his family, including his mother whom he was caring for.

He added: 'He was an impressive member of society, for two years worked as an intervention worker dedicated to helping youths and gained employment in that field.

'For a man who had such potential and support from his family, friends and colleagues, it can only be described as tragic how his life has turned out to date.'

Rishy Panesar, for Reid, said his client was attending anger management counselling.

Reid, of Chafford Hundred, Grays, Essex, admitted causing actual bodily harm and common assault but denied sexual assault.

Samuels, of Barking, Essex, denied causing actual bodily harm and sexual assault.

They were convicted after a trial in March.

Both were also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for ten years.
