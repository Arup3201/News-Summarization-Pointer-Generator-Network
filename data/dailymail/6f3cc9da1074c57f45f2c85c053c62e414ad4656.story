Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said being bored was an important skill for children to learn

Children must learn to be bored and entertain themselves, says Education Secretary Nicky Morgan in a warning to parents not to plan activities around the clock.

The mother-of-one said parents have to 'grapple' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games consoles, insisting turning off gadgets forces them to play with traditional toys like Lego and cars.

And she warned parents not to do homework themselves, stressing it does not help their children and good teachers will be catch them out.

Mrs Morgan married husband Jonathan in 2000 and they have a seven-year-old son, Alex. She balances her job in charge of schools across England with family life. 

Many parents trying to plan extra-curricular activities to keep children occupied for every waking moment, but Mrs Morgan said is important to let children be bored.

She told House magazine: 'I do think that, speaking as a mum, when my son says "I’m bored", I say "Well, just go away and find something to do, you’ve got lots of toys, lots of things there". 

'And then suddenly I will find that my son is busy, has dragged something out, he’s amusing himself, and I think that there is an element of not needing every moment in the day to be filled. 

'I think it’s an important skill to be learned. If we say to him "just go and do something", it’s amazing how much the Lego will come out, or Playmobil, whatever it might be, and actually it’s lovely then to see him, he’s busy building things, Hot Wheels tracks.'

However, while her parents' generation just had to coax youngsters away from watching television, today children have many more hi-tech distractions.

On one occasion Alex woke early one morning wanting to play on his tablet. 'Alex woke us up at half past five. And as a result he lost gadget time for the rest of the day. 

'He was deeply unimpressed by that. We had a little negotiation about whether "gadget time" meant "TV and screen time".'

She went on: 'Because of the growth of tablets and everything else and the fact that children are using them younger - which is many ways a good thing, they are great learning tools – I think it’s all kinds of new challenges. 

'I guess our parents had ‘TV time’, we had the same kind of issue, but I do think it’s one of those things to grapple with.'

Mr Morgan said parents have to 'grapple' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games console

Last year a study suggested that almost a quarter of parents complete homework with no input from their child.

But Mrs Morgan said it was counter-productive and does little to help their children in the long run. 

'I think it’s about parental supervision and support and engagement. You know it’s not them. I would trust teachers to make sure they were asking for projects that work, that children are going to be doing. 

'They will make it clear to parents that you’re not helping necessarily if you’re doing an awful lot of it.' 

Despite being in charge of the nation's teachers, she confessed to being uneasy about talking to them.

'I do think as a parent sometimes you want to know what’s going on in the classroom but don’t necessarily know how to ask. I still get nervous talking to teachers and it reminds you of being at school yourself. And seeing what your child is doing is really, really important.'

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said she would like to send her son to a secondary state school when he is older

Mrs Morgan said she would 'very much like' to send her son to a state secondary school when he is older.

The Loughborough MP, who was educated at the private Surbiton High School, indicated that she would follow her predecessor Michael Gove and Prime Minister David Cameron in sending her child to a state secondary.

In the wide-ranging interview,  she also stressed the importance of teaching British values of tolerance and free speech to youngsters in the wake of the terror atrocities in Paris.

The Tory minister said the attacks by Islamic extremists in the French capital were an example of what happens 'when people don't appear to respect some of those values'.

She said the attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in the French capital had shown the need to teach youngsters about the importance of "core values".

'One of the other things we are asking of schools is the whole teaching of British values. This applies to all schools, it's about these core values.

'We've seen what can happen last week when people don't appear to respect some of those values, things like tolerance and mutual respect.

In the light of recent events ... It's very, very important.

'I know this is being discussed in governing boards up and down the country. Many schools do this without necessarily badging it as such.

And others are having to think 'how do we bring this in?'

She said citizenship and social education classes were "very important' and added 'we must have core common values, that builds us as a country'.

Mrs Morgan said: "These British values have been defined in various strategies, by the Home Office, and we are asking schools to think about how they promote them. Ofsted will be looking at them when they visit schools.

'It's about that shared history or heritage which I think makes us really strong as a country. We have freedom of speech and liberty in this country, we may not have had a revolution in the same way they perhaps had in France but I do think there are things that are precious and if we don't guard them and if we don't appreciate them ... Sometimes we think it's not very British to talk about them - but I think it's now clear that we do need to talk about them.'
