They are two of Britain’s most acclaimed comedy writers, between them responsible for  The Young Ones, Blackadder and Four Weddings And A Funeral.

But there is one BBC sitcom so bizarre, and deemed such a dud, that it has been airbrushed from the CVs of Ben Elton and Richard Curtis – and never screened in the 30 years since it was made.

The pair wrote a show in  which Margaret Thatcher was a space alien who had been recalled to Mars – then replaced as  Prime Minister by Suggs from  the pop group Madness, with his bandmates as the Cabinet.

The show called 'Madness' featuring the band was never commissioned by BBC 2 and the pilot show was never broadcast

A clip from the show, called simply Madness, will be seen for the first time tonight as part of BBC2’s 50th birthday celebrations. Described as a ‘dummy run which didn’t make it out of the starting blocks’, the show was never commissioned as a series.

Jokes in the 1984 episode – in which the seat of power has been transplanted to a room above a cafe – include one musician telling Suggs: ‘Prime Minister, I don’t want to scare you – but boo!’

In another scene Suggs discovers that he has carried saxophonist Lee Thompson all the way from Kentish Town in North London to Downing Street in his saxophone case. An unrepentant Thompson tells Suggs, ‘You ought to be glad I don’t play the piano’, and Suggs turns directly to the camera and says: ‘Good point!’

The clips are included in a documentary called The Comedy Vaults: BBC2’s Hidden Treasure, which celebrates trial shows ‘made for little money and usually not for public consumption’.

Other clips include scenes from Miranda Hart’s Joke Shop from 2008, which became the hugely successful Miranda, and the now forgotten Guess Who’s Coming  To Dinner, in which Anne Robinson asked celebrities for their ideal dinner party guests. In the pilot, Ricky Gervais tells the Weakest Link host ‘not to try any of your fascist prostitute stuff’.

Another of the shows which had never been broadcast featured Alan Bennett

The documentary also includes a recently discovered performance from Alan Bennett in his 1966 series On The Margin. The playwright, who turned 80 on Friday, plays a businessman who signs off a telegram to his wife with ‘Norwich’, which he explains is code for ‘Nickers off, ready when I come home’. Until the clip was found, it had been assumed the entire series of On The Margin had been wiped by the BBC.

Tonight’s documentary, which airs at 9pm, also includes footage of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in their stage show Behind The Fridge, which has not been shown on British TV for 45 years, and the pilot episode of QI from 2002.

Elton and Curtis were unavailable to comment on Madness last night.
