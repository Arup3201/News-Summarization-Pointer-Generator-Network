A science teacher has been sacked after she pretended she had cancer and even swabbed colleagues for DNA to see if they could save her life by donating tissue.

Samantha Scrine, 26, today admitted falsely claiming she was dying from  stomach cancer but says she should not be struck off because 'stress' made her believe her bogus illness existed.

A Cardiff tribunal heard she was an 'attention seeker' who for eight months convinced colleagues she was dying.

Tribunal: Samantha Scrine, 26, was sacked for lying about having cancer but has asked not to be struck off because 'stress' made her believe it was true. A Cardiff tribunal heard she was an 'attention seeker'

She also gave them a funeral wish list including songs for the service, a presentation on her life and a credit card to pay for things after she died.

Miss Scrine - who was in good physical health - even asked her colleagues to be donors and took DNA swabs from her workmates pretending she needed to find out if their bone marrow matched.

She then forged documents from the local hospital thanking her teaching them for providing the DNA samples.

Miss Scrine claimed she was undergoing radiotherapy and was too ill to teach and her school then arranged for cover at a cost of £5,500.

Her deceit was only revealed when concerned colleagues approached her family who said she was not ill. 

Presenting officer Louise Price told the tribunal today: 'She told the school she had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer.

'She said she had found a lump in her stomach but there was no treatment due to its location and she wasn't sure how much time she had to live.

'Miss Scrine said she had arranged radiotherapy for outside class time but she started to miss school due to illness.

Fantasy: Miss Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months and even encouraged them to take DNA swabs

'She claimed
 the cancer had spread to her hip and texted fellow teachers asking for a
 DNA samples to be taken to see if they were a match.

'She
 took swabs from a number of teachers and members of their family. Some 
of them received a letter from the hospital thanking them for their 
swabs.'

Miss
 Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in 
Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months.

Battle: The school want her struck off but she denies being dishonest because she had 'medical anxiety'

She
 invented stories about her fellow hospital patients, claiming she had 
befriended a 10-year-old girl who had later died of cancer.

A General Teaching Council for Wales hearing was told how she backed up her story by sending thousands of text messages pretending to be her own mother.

The school eventually spoke to her actual family - who confirmed she did not have cancer but was suffering from depression.

In June last year, she was sacked for 'gross misconduct of an unusual and serious nature'.

The hearing in Cardiff was told how teachers at the school claim they will never trust each other again.

In a statement one unnamed colleague said they couldn't believe they had been taken in by her 'attention seeking lies'.

Miss Scrine claimed she had 'medical anxiety' brought on by stress and genuinely believe she was dying.

She claimed she would go to hospital waiting rooms and take pain medication to cope with her symptoms.

She admits making false statements, obtaining DNA swabs under false pretences and falsifying documents from Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.

She accepts that this constitutes unacceptable professional conduct. She denies acting dishonestly - but could be struck off by the disciplinary panel.

The case continues.
