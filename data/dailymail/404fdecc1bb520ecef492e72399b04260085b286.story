Family: Tia Sharp's mother Natalie and grandmother Christine Bicknell arriving at the Old Bailey today

The man accused of murdering schoolgirl Tia Sharp claimed her death was an accident and insisted ‘I’m not like Ian Huntley’, a court heard yesterday.

Stuart Hazell told prison officers after his arrest that ‘nothing sexual’ had happened between him and 12-year-old Tia.

Prosecutors allege he smothered Tia and took pictures of her naked body before hiding her in the attic of the house he shared with the youngster’s grandmother, Christine Bicknell, in Croydon, South London.

They claim Hazell, 37, was obsessed with paedophile websites and in the weeks before her death repeatedly filmed Tia as she slept – and on one occasion as she rubbed cream on her legs while in her underwear.

But following his arrest last August, Hazell protested to Belmarsh prison officer Warren Fegan that he was not like notorious Soham killer Huntley, who was jailed for 40 years for killing Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

Mr Fegan told the Old Bailey: ‘He was saying, “I’m not like Ian Huntley, it was nothing sexual, I’m not a nonce”.

‘He was saying that the Press were trying to make it look like it was sexual but it wasn’t.

‘He said it was an accident, that she’d fallen down the stairs and broken her neck.

‘He said he didn’t know what to do so he picked her up and took her upstairs and laid her on the bed.

He said he thought she’d get better. He didn’t know what to do so he wrapped her up in a sheet and put her in the loft.’

The prison officer said Hazell asked him how hard it would be to get a not guilty verdict for murder but guilty for manslaughter.

He added that when window cleaner Hazell was assessed at the prison he was deemed to be at ‘extreme’ risk of harming himself. ‘He really wanted to kill himself. He was saying he was sorry and he felt guilty. He wanted to be dead. He wanted away from everything.’

Mr Fegan said that in another conversation two days later, Hazell told him that he ‘wished he could turn back the clock’.

‘He said, “I deserve everything I get – 25 to 30 years, I don’t care”.

‘He said he couldn’t get the images of Tia out of his head once the police had shown him.

'I remember asking how he was feeling and I remember him putting his face in his hands and saying “guilty”.’

Tia’s decomposed body was discovered wrapped in a sheet and bin liners in Hazell’s loft a week after she was reported missing in August last year.

But Hazell told another prison officer, Paul Leahy, that he believed his neighbours had killed Tia and moved her body into his attic through interlinked lofts in the terrace houses.

He accused the police of ‘fitting him up’ and said at least six other people had seen Tia alive after him, jurors were told.

Hazell is said to have told Mr Leahy:
‘In my opinion, police need to look at all the neighbours. That’s what 
the Press don’t tell you, that all six or eight houses have joined lofts
which are linked together.
‘Police have searched my house four times and not found anything with dogs and from specialist search teams.

‘In my opinion someone moved her into my loft.

‘If you saw my loft you would see it’s impossible for me to get up there. I’m a big bloke.

‘I told police about a couple a few 
doors down, a bloke and a woman. I think they are Somalis. They were 
shouting and throwing plates at each other, it’s them the police should 
look at.’ He said that this couple were the ‘real bacons’ – prison slang
for paedophiles, the court heard.

He also told the prison officer that 
Tia had been hassled by paedophiles on her phone and said if he had 
killed her he would  have ‘done a runner to Scotland or Germany’.

The court heard that Hazell also told
Mr Leahy: ‘I have a real problem with my anger and when people say 
wrong things to me, I can flip.  I just feel like hurting everyone.’

The Old Bailey heard that the day after Tia disappeared, Hazell cooked dinner for her and set it aside even though he knew she was already dead.

He told Ms Bicknell that she had left the house at midday, and when they sat down to eat at 6pm he saved food for her.

'I put some chips in a separate pot for Tia,' Hazell told police after his arrest. 'I didn't want to do them at the same time and burn them because she always moans.

'We had dinner around 6ish and I put Tia's pizza in the oven so I could just throw the chips in the deep fat fryer when she got in.'

A statement from senior prison officer Gerald King, which was read out in court, recounted a conversation he had with Hazell.

'He stated that he wanted to end it and take his life,' the statement said. 'He didn't want to be seen as an Ian Huntley.

'He
added that it was an accident, that he had been playing with her at the
top of the stairs as they always did. She fell down the stairs and 
broke her neck.

'He 
wished he could turn back time. He then laid her on the bed for a while,
then wrapped her in a blanket and put her in the roof.'

Hazell expressed regret at not coming clean about the accident and even joined in with family conversations threatening to take revenge against her killer, according to Mr King.

'He wished that he had explained the accident to his partner but he didn't want to ruin the relationship,' the officer said.

Later, junior prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward and Detective Constable Darrell Ayaydin read a transcript of a police witness interview Hazell gave on August 5.

In the interview the 37-year-old described meeting Tia in Croydon, the pair spending the evening together before she went to bed, and then her leaving to go to Croydon on her own the following morning.

Hazell told police the 12-year-old wanted to buy some sandals, but as he 'hated' shopping, he had given her some money and let her go alone.

He also claimed that she mentioned going to meet a boy and spent the night before messaging someone, but 'kicked himself' for not paying attention to the person's name.

The court heard Tia probably died as a result of 'suffocation or chest compression'.

And, it was alleged that after murdering Tia, Hazell took a photograph of the 12-year-old’s naked body.

Experts were unable to give a definite cause of death as the 12-year-old’s body was so badly decomposed.

But pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl said: 'Considering the negative findings and taking this case as a whole as it has been presented to me, it seems a form of suffocation or chest compression would appear to be the most likely cause of death.

'It is one I cannot make for sure because of the condition of the body.'

The Old Bailey heard Tia was dressed in a pink and white Little Miss Giggles pyjama set when her body was found a week after she went missing last August.

Sobs could be heard from the public gallery as a picture of the 12-year-old's body flashed up on video screens in the courtroom and some family members had to leave.

Dr Fegan-Earl told jurors he was unable to find any evidence a brutal attack had taken place but he said: 'It cannot be completely excluded.'

Nor could he say if Tia, who was 4ft 11 and weighed 49kgs - nearly eight stone - had definitely been sexually assaulted.

He added: 'She was dressed at the time in white and pink pyjama bottoms and a vest which had Little Miss Giggles on.'

Mr Fegan-Earl said there were no injuries on her body to suggest she died as a result of a fall, as Hazell claims.

She had no broken bones, obvious bruising or bleeding, he said.

The court heard the doctor ‘did not find any positive pathological sign of injury.’

But he said if Tia had been suffocated subtle signs of compression to the chest, neck or face could have disappeared post-mortem.

Jurors heard there were traces of amphetamine in Tia’s body but the pathologist was certain this was due to natural processes after death and not that she had been drugged.

The court was again shown a sickening image of a girl believed to be Tia lying naked on a bed, which was recovered on a memory stick allegedly belonging to Hazell.

Mr Fegan-Earl said: 'When I saw this photo there were changes in the body that suggest to me that the individual is dead.

'There is certainly the possibility that this picture is Tia Sharp.'

The pathologist added the body showed signs it had been lying for a period of time on its back and had been moved into that position.

He identified ‘blood pooling’ in the thighs which he suggested showed the body had been lying face-up for a while after dying.

Hazell, of New Addington, Croydon, denies murdering the schoolgirl between August 2 and 10 last year.

The trial continues.
