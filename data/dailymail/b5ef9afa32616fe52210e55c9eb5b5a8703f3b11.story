Spain coach Vicente del Bosque insists Diego Costa will not be risked if they have any doubts about the Chelsea striker's fitness after calling him up for next week's European Championship qualifiers.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho would have preferred to see Costa rested for the matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg so the in-form forward could receive treatment on his hamstring.

Costa has been in prolific goalscoring form since his £32million summer move to Stamford Bridge but Mourinho revealed last week that the former Atletico Madrid man was barely training for fear of exacerbating his hamstring problems.

However, Costa said on Wednesday he had no intention of skipping Spain duty and on Friday he was included in Del Bosque's 23-man squad.

Del Bosque, though, says he will not take any risks with the 25-year-old, just like he would not with any other player.

He told a press conference: 'When we call up someone it's because we believe he's fit to play. He's been playing in all the (Chelsea) games and if he comes and isn't in condition to play, we won't force him, as has always been the case with all our players.

'We always take into account the physical state of the players. We don't force anybody, we've never obliged anybody to play.

'The medical team will decide on these things.' 

Costa has been in sparkling form for Chelsea in the Premier League so far this season

As well as Costa, Del Bosque has recalled Gerard Pique and included uncapped duo Rodrigo Moreno and Juan Bernat in his squad.

Barca defender Pique has been drafted back in after missing the opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia.

Del Bosque said of Pique: 'If he had been fit for the previous squad he would have come. I think it is more important that we have faith in him and he always been committed to the team.'

'We always look only at the sporting side of things. He has been with us for a long time. We will have a look at his condition and he will be useful for the team.

'We think he has been playing enough and he has recovered from his back problem. He is a useful player for us.'

The Spain coach also highlighted the versatility of the two new comers, forward Rodrigo, who is on loan at Valencia from Benfica, and Bayern Munich wing-back Juan Bernat.

He said: 'They have both been playing very well and have been in the Under-21s.

'Because of Bernat's qualities we think he can play either at the back or in a more advanced position on the left. Rodrigo has also played on the right wing or as a second striker at Valencia.

'Both should be national team players for years to come.'

Two-time reigning European champions Spain, who beat Macedonia 5-1 in their first competitive match since their miserable World Cup defence this summer, go to Slovakia on October 9 and then travel to Luxembourg three days later.

Del Bosque added: 'We need to be very careful because now it's very difficult to beat any team.

'Slovakia have already won in Ukraine and Luxembourg are not the same as years ago, when you could expect to thrash them. We have to take care as they could cause problems.'
