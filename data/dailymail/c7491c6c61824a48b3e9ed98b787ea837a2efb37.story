The Tories have surged into a four-point lead as Labour’s woes with business hit home with voters, a poll showed last night.

Support for the Conservatives rose by six points during the past month following Ed Miliband’s high-profile clashes with business leaders, the ICM poll for the Guardian found.

It put the Conservatives on 36 per cent – just a point down from their 2010 general election result – Labour on 32 and the Liberal Democrats on 10.

Conservative gains: David Cameron’s party has jumped six points to 36 per cent - just one point short of what he achieved at the 2010 General Election 

The Tories’ showing is their highest since May 2012 and will cause alarm at Labour high command. The poll, conducted from February 13-15, put support for Ukip down by two points to 9 per cent. 

It suggests that voters who have flirted with Ukip are beginning to return to the Tory fold ahead of the general election. Support for the Greens also fell by two points.

Last night Labour faced fresh controversy over the economy after shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said British businesses should learn from their counterparts in France. 

Unemployment in France is almost double the rate in the UK, and economic growth was just 0.4 per cent last year compared to 2.6 per cent here.

But Mr Umunna insisted the French model had lessons to offer, particularly on productivity, which is higher than in the UK.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘People will be alarmed that Labour’s vision for the economy is that we should be more like France – in plain English that means mass unemployment, excessive borrowing and economic failure.

‘Why would we want to go back to where we were five short years ago with Labour?’

Only last week, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned that a weak Labour government was likely to damage investor confidence and economic growth.

The giant investment bank told clients that a Labour victory could ‘trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth. In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.’

Two other surveys gave Labour a narrow lead. One commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft put Mr Miliband’s party unchanged on 31 per cent, regaining their lead over the Tory Party which dropped four points to 30. 

A Populus poll had Labour down one point on 33 per cent, keeping a lead over the Tories, who were unchanged on 31.

Mr Miliband launched Labour’s economic strategy with a pledge that all school leavers with the required grades will be offered an apprenticeship. 

He said all firms winning major government contracts would have to provide apprenticeships, and confirmed Labour would cancel a planned cut in corporation tax to fund a cut in business rates.
