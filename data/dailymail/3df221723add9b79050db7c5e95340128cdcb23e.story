The Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers are threatening to leave their hometowns and share stadium outside Los Angeles  if both teams fail to get new stadium deals.

The division rivals announced their $1.7billion plan in a joint statement Thursday night, adding another layer of complexity to a possible NFL return to the region.

The plan creates the odd prospect of the teams suddenly sharing a home field, and of Los Angeles having two NFL teams after going two decades with none.

The Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders both played their last games in the city in 1994 - then moved to St. Louis and Oakland, respectively.

And it takes the muddled issue of the NFL's return to Southern California and makes it downright messy, with at least three viable stadium plans in the works.

St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke is part of a joint venture to build an 80,000-seat stadium at the site of the former Hollywood Park horse track just 10 miles from Carson in Inglewood. 

And a plan remains alive for an NFL facility in downtown Los Angeles. That stadium known as Farmers Field, until recently the leading candidate for the NFL's return to the area, now becomes a long shot with multiple competitors and no clear team attached. 

The proposed shared stadium for the Chargers and Raiders would be in Carson, 15 miles south of downtown LA and home to the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team.

The site of the proposed stadium - Carson Marketplace - is part of an old municipal landfill that the NFL has looked into buying at least three times, according to LA Times.

The teams' statement says both have tried and failed for years to find stadium solutions in Oakland and San Diego, and without new agreements in those cities their hands will be forced.

'We are pursuing this stadium option in Carson for one straightforward reason,' the statement says. 'If we cannot find a permanent solution in our home markets, we have no alternative but to preserve other options to guarantee the future economic viability of our franchises.'  

Earlier this month, the NFL sent a memo warning teams that the league itself will be behind any decision to move to Southern California, and established a committee of owners to review the options. 

The Chargers and Raiders statement says they will respect and adhere to the guidelines the league laid out.

Both teams said they plan to work in good faith through 2015 to find new agreements to stay in their current homes.

The Chargers' talks with San Diego City Hall to replace the nearly 50-year-old Qualcomm Stadium have grown increasingly contentious.

If plans to move continue, all NFL teams looking into stadiums in Los Angeles are targeting 2016 for relocation. The only two NFL teams to share a stadium currently are the Jets and the Giants, who play in East Rutherford, New Jersey

Mayor Kevin Faulconer appointed an advisory group earlier this month to recommend a site and financing plan for a new stadium that can go on the November 2016 ballot. 

But Chargers' attorney Mark Fabiani told the group that there may not be a publicly acceptable solution to the problem and warned them against using the team for political advantage.

The Raiders are in the final year of their lease at the even older Oakland Coliseum. 

The rundown stadium had sewage and electrical problems in the past year and is now the only stadium in the United States used as the home for both an NFL and Major League Baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. 

The team wants to build a new stadium at the site but talks with the city have shown little progress.

Though Los Angeles does not have a team now, it has been home to the Chargers, Raiders and Rams in the last 60 years.

The Chargers played their inaugural first season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961. The Rams moved from Southern California to St. Louis after the 1994 season. 

After that same season, the Raiders returned to Oakland, where they had played from 1960, their first year a team, to 1981. 

The Rams's stadium struggle in St. Louis has made progress with a burgeoning plan for a 64,000-seat stadium there on the city's north riverfront.

'Our focus is 100 percent committed to keeping the Rams here in their home of St. Louis and ensuring that we remain an NFL city for generations to come,' said former Anheuser-Busch president Dave Peacock, who is heading effort to keep the Rams in St. Louis. 'We are very encouraged and thrilled with the progress we've made.'

The only two NFL teams to share a stadium currently are the Jets and the Giants, who play in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
