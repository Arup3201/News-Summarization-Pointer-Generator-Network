It seems Real Madrid are getting as much preparation in as humanly possible ahead of the club's Champions League final clash against rivals Atletico.

Star man Cristiano Ronaldo was filmed with the rest of his team-mates limbering up on the rooftop of what appears to be their Lisbon hotel on Saturday.

The entire squad appeared to take part in the warm-up as Carlo Ancelotti's men ensure they do everything right ahead of the showdown against Diego Simeone's La Liga winners.

Portugal international Ronaldo is expected to be fit for the clash as Madrid look to claim their 10th European Cup triumph.

The former Manchester United frontman has not played since May 7 when he was withdrawn 
through injury during Real's 1-1 draw with Valladolid.

Ronaldo had been expected to face Espanyol for his side's final La Liga
 game of the season last 
weekend, but was removed from the squad as a precaution after feeling 
discomfort during the warm-up. However, the 29-year-old trained with his
 team-mates on Friday and manager Carlo Ancelotti revealed there were no
 concerns about Ronaldo's fitness.

Despite
 Ronaldo's progress, the Real boss admitted the 
fitness of defender Pepe - who was pictured receiving treatment during 
Friday's training session - and French striker Karim Benzema will have to be assessed after the pair only managed to train for one day during the last week.

Los
 Blancos have not won Europe's elite competition for 12 years, beating 
surprise package Bayer Leverkuesen in the 2002 final 2-1 courtesy of a 
Raul opener and Zinedine Zidane's iconic volley.
