Fifty Shades of Grey is set to feature more sex on screen than the 100 raunchiest films released in 2014 put together, making it the most erotic mainstream movie in a decade.

The film, which premieres on Valentine's Day features a dozen sex scenes, which make up 20 minutes of its total 100-minute running time.

This follows an interview with actor Jamie Dornan, who plays main man Christian Grey, where he says he 'does not believe it is pornographic or even erotic.'

'Not even erotic': Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson star as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in the upcoming filmatisation of Fifty Shades of Grey, claimed to be the 'raunchiest' film in a decade

The 'raunchiest of the decade' accolade has been awarded Fifty Shades after website Mr Skin, which ranks films by amount of sex scenes, released the data seen by the Sunday Times.  

Fifty Shades Of Grey, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Dornan as the BDSM-loving  Christian Grey, is one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year, and its trailer has already been viewed more than 45 million times on YouTube.

But Mrs Taylor-Johnson, 47, said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for.

'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said.

'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.

'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' Mrs Taylor-Johnson, who is married to British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: 

'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' 

Asked if he felt he had lived up to E L James's fantasies, Dornan, 32, told the Sunday Times Culture supplement: 'Nobody can walk in and embody what she wants. It doesn't exist. 

'But I hope I'm the closest thing. I hope I'm a good enough actor, and it's passable.'

The father-of-one also said that although the film is sexual, he does not believe it is pornographic or even erotic.

'I just wouldn't use the word 'erotic' - it brings up different ideas for me. I just think we tried to make a good picture, you know?'

The series of three Grey books written by James, 51, from London,  has reportedly sold over 100 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 52 languages.
