The iconic Christmas trucks come and go in the blink of an eye in Coca-Cola's new advert, as the company gears up for its much anticipated festive season commercial.

The annual 'Holidays are Coming' advert, which will debut tomorrow night during the X Factor, has been preempted by another Christmas-themed Coca-Cola commercial in which strangers, family and friends are seen carrying out simple acts of kindness.

But those hoping for a decent glimpse at the beloved Christmas trucks are out of luck.

The minimal screen time given to them in the commercial - called 'Give a Little Happiness' - means if you look away, you'll miss them.

Set to the song 'Make Someone Happy' by Jimmy Durante, the trucks are seen passing by a man and his daughter towards the end of the clip.

Coca-Cola is saving its best until last in the advert, with many of the much loved motifs of its popular 'Holidays are Coming' advert noticeably absent.

It comes after a recent survey showed Coca-Cola's advert is the nation's number one indicator that the festive season has begun.

A study by thinkmoney.co.uk showed 20 per cent of Britons think the appearance of the advert marks the start of Christmas.

This was trailed by John Lewis' Christmas commercial, which 5 per cent of us consider the beginning of our countdown.

Bobby Brittain, from Coca-Cola, said the company had a 'long standing legacy' of spreading festive cheer and its Christmas campaigns marked the beginning of the unofficial countdown.

Dates have also been released for the truck's 45-stop tour across Britain. Starting on November 28, it will traverse Britain's north before making its way down the country to finish at Wembley, London, on December 23.
