Ride-sharing company Lyft is getting a facelift in the form of a haircut.

The San Francisco-based firm has ditched its iconic 3ft-wide fluffy pink mustaches.

Instead, the easy-to-spot decoration adorning the front grilles of Lyft cars has been replaced with a 5in-long plastic replica which goes on the dashboard.

The new mascots light up so customers can differentiate Lyft vehicles at night.

Sleeker look: Lyft co-founder John Zimmer displays his company's new mascot - a 5in-long plastic replica of the original fluffy mustache which goes on the dashboard 

About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday.

Commenting on the haircut, a representative for Lyft said: 'The new glowstache marks an exciting moment for Lyft as we embark on the next chapter of our growth.

'We’ll begin rolling the glowstache out to Lyft drivers across the country in the coming weeks.'

Lyft is one of several companies that allow customers to use a smartphone app to book and pay for rides in a private car.

It currently operates in more than 50 U.S. cities. 

The big pink mustaches were introduced as part of Lyft's launch effort in 2012.

However, the symbol stuck around longer than expected because it continued to create hype.

More importantly, Lyft president John Zimmer said the gimmick made people smile.

However, recently it was decided a makeover was needed.

Jesse McMillin, the company’s new creative director, told Wired.com: 'A lot of times you’d see people driving around and [the fluffy pink mustache] was cockeyed, or matted, or windblown.'

Lyft phased out the original mustaches a few months back in place of the sleeker glowstaches.

Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations.

The app matches them with the nearest driver.

Drivers attach  pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers.

Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers.

Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer

Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.
