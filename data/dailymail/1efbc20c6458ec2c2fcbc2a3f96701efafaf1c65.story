A mother who sexually abused her own six and eight-year-old daughters with a boyfriend has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by a judge who declared her 'the vilest b**** that I have ever met'.

Amanda Arellano, 29, pleaded guilty to rape and aggravated child molestation on Thursday in Bibb County Superior Court, Georgia. 

Among the horrific abuse she committed with 30-year-old boyfriend Daniel Kelly Copeland, the mother admitted to holding one of her girls down so her partner could rape the child.

Amanda Arellano, 29, was jailed for 30 years in Georgia on Thursday for the rape of her own daughters, aged six and eight. Her boyfriend was previously sentenced for the sex attacks. The judge said this week there was 'a special place in hell' for people like Arellano

Daniel Kelly Copeland, 30, was sentenced to 25 years in 2012 for raping two girls 

The sexual abuse took place on the little girls three years ago when the couple decided to bring the children 'into their sexual behaviors as a couple', The Telegraph reported. 

Details of the case left many in the courtroom in tears as they heard details of how the sisters were forced to take part in sex acts with the couple and photographs were taken of the sordid acts.

The children were also forced to watch the pedophiles have sex. 

'This is how men show you they love you,' Arellano reportedly told one of the girls.  

The vile abuse took place between September 1, 2011, and January 18, 2012. 

The crimes took place at the couple's home in Macon, Georgia along another home and an abandoned trailer. 

Arellano was due to stand trial next week but she pleaded guilty with prosecutors agreeing to the plea to spare the children the torment of testifying about the abuse. 

Copeland was jailed for 25 years for child rape in 2012 after his father called the police when his son admitted to abusing the girls.  

The mother will spend 30 years in jail and was registered for life as a sex offender. 

She whispered apologies to the court on Thursday to which Judge Howard Simms reportedly responded: 'Ms. Arellano, I don’t know that I have ever said a curse word from this bench but you may be the vilest b**** that I have ever met.'

He added that 'hell had a special place' for those who committed crimes like Arellano.

It's not the judge's first brush with controversy. He was caught drink-driving in October 2012 and entered rehab but did not resign from the bench.

He was reprimanded by the officers who stopped him in Bibb County but was not charged.

He told 13WMAZ: 'It has been hard and a difficult process but also the most rewarding year of my life. I've reconnected with a family I ignored and got a lot more involved in the things that I do, and my life from day to day.'

Simms ran for re-election to the Macon Judicial Circuit, Georgia. He won without opposition in May this year.
