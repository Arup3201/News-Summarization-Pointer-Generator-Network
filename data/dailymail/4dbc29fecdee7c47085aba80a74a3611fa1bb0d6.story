Britain has ‘left intensive care’ and its economic recovery means the Government can start to return the taxpayer-owned banks to the private sector, the Chancellor declared last night.

A sell-off of Lloyds could begin within months, while Royal Bank of Scotland may be split into two before shares are offered, almost certainly after the next election.

George Osborne announced an urgent review of proposals to divide RBS into a ‘good bank’ which can lend more to homebuyers and small firms, and a ‘bad bank’ to isolate its toxic assets.

In his annual Mansion House speech in 
London last night, he said ‘nothing better signals Britain’s move from 
rescue to recovery than the fact we can start to plan for our exit from 
government share ownership of our biggest banks’.

Gordon Brown pumped £45.5billion of 
taxpayers’ money into RBS and £20.5billion into Lloyds as they neared 
collapse in 2008 and 2009, leaving the state owning about 80 per cent of
RBS and 40 per cent of Lloyds. The sell-off will be the biggest 
privatisation ever seen in Britain.

Mr Osborne made clear for the first 
time that the Government believes the economy has at last turned the 
corner after five years of misery.

The Bank of England should not raise interest rates too quickly, because it could trigger ‘great damage’ to families and businesses, the outgoing governor said last night.

In his final speech before retiring next week, Sir Mervyn King (right) warned against ‘a rapid return’ to higher rates.

Despite 23 years at the Bank, he admits leaving ‘much unfinished business’, such as a broken banking system and a fragile economy.

Base rate was cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 – the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694.

Rates have not risen since, rescuing millions of families from disaster by slashing mortgage bills.

In his Mansion House speech, Sir Mervyn, who will be made a life peer when he retires, warned: ‘A rapid return to higher interest rates would do great damage to the balance sheets of highly indebted households, companies and, especially, financial institutions.’

There has been fierce debate at the 
top of the Government over to what extent ministers should go public 
with their increasing optimism.

However, he confirmed what Treasury 
officials have believed for months – that while there are still risks 
ahead, he believes the economy has at last returned to solid if 
unspectacular growth.

He said: ‘No recovery from such a deep and 
damaging global recession is going to be straightforward.

‘But equally, the economic news here 
in Britain has been better in recent months. The economy is growing. 
Record numbers are in work. Surveys of confidence and future activity 
are stronger. Let me say tonight: the British economy is healing.  

‘But while Britain has left intensive 
care, we still need to secure the recovery – and make sure we continue 
to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place.’

Senior Tories believe the  
privatisation of the banks will be a moment of huge political 
significance as ‘payback time’ from the sector. It could rekindle the 
excitement of the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign, in which five million people 
bought shares in British Gas.

The Chancellor did not set out a timetable, but said the Government is ‘actively considering options for share sales’.

The first tranche is likely to be 
offered to institutional investors and could take place by the end of 
this year.

election.

Share sales in RBS are some way off, 
the Chancellor indicated, and will almost certainly not take place 
before 2015.

In the run-up, Mr Osborne suggested he wanted RBS to focus 
aggressively on its core UK business – lending to individuals and small 
firms.

He announced a review to conclude by 
autumn the option of carving up RBS – and said any bad bank could not 
involve a further injection of public cash.
