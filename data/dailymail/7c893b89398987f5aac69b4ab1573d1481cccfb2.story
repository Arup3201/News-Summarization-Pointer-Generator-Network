Jimmy Savile was given the keys to a private hospital block where he would regularly take teenage girls, a former porter has claimed.

Former Leeds  General Infirmary porter Terry Pratt claims late Jim'll Fix It star was handed a key to the nurses' accommodation building at the hospital  'by a lad on the front desk' several times a month during the late 1980s.

The ex-worker told the BBC that Savile would arrive with the girls in the early hours of the morning and then leave before dawn.

Fresh revelations: Former hospital porter Terry Pratt claims Jimmy Savile was given the keys to nurses' accommodation at Leeds General Infirmary where he would take teenage girls in the middle of the night

Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the television and radio star's activities, and he is now believed to have been of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims.

Mr Pratt said he became suspicious when Savile began arriving in the middle of the night with different girls who seemed 'star-struck' and were 'not streetwise'.

He told the BBC: 'He would go up and see the lad on the desk [and he would say] "Here's the key Jim, make sure I get it back".

'He'd take the key and the two of them would look through the doorway... he would walk out and the two women would follow him towards the nurses' home.'

'He was going into a property he had no right to go into. He wasn't a doctor and he wasn't a nurse.'

He added that the celebrity, who was a volunteer and fundraiser for the hospital, would make several late-night visits a month where he would ask for the key to the accommodation block, spend a few hours there and then leave at 5am.

Mr Pratt said he became suspicious when 
Savile began arriving in the middle of the night with different girls 
who seemed 'star-struck' and were 'not streetwise'. 'You'd see their eyes watching him - everything he did,' he said.

But nobody questioned the late presenter's behaviour at the time, he 
said, adding: 'We looked at him as a sort of film star, a cult figure.'

But Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it believed Mr Pratt was wrong because he was not working at Leeds General Infirmary at the time referred to.

It said: 'We are concerned to hear the allegations which have been made by Mr Pratt and have been quoted widely in the media.

'We have investigated his claims today with other staff who were around at Leeds General Infirmary at the time and we believe he is mistaken in his comments.

'Mr Pratt appears to have been talking about a period in the 1980s before he started work at the hospital in 1990 and not from first-hand knowledge.

'The assurance we have been given is that the porters did not have a key to unlock the nurses' home. The building had a warden on duty 24 hours a day and we understand access was very strictly controlled to protect the staff living there.

'The accusations against Savile are serious and naturally are of great concern. The police are continuing their national investigation and anyone with evidence should speak to them.'

It comes as a close friend of Jimmy Savile today said 
he feels guilty for failing to notice the abuse as police investigate 300 potential victims who may have
fallen prey to Savile.

DJ 
Dave Eager, who worked with Savile in the 1960s, wore a ‘Jimmy’s eager 
helper’ jumper and ‘Jim fixed it for me’ badge to Savile’s funeral last 
year.

But the 64-year-old  
has confessed that he blames himself for failing to notice any of the 
alleged abuse during their 40-year friendship.

Mr Eager told The Sun that he knew nothing of the abuse allegedly done by Savile.

He said: ‘I just don’t recognise this so you end up blaming yourself. 

‘I just don’t know what’s going on. I feel I should be punished. I’m very distressed about the whole thing.’

Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry as part of the investigation while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse.

It is also looking at the decision-making process that saw a Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities shelved.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said 'heads will need to roll' at the BBC if it is discovered that abuse was ignored.

'Serious questions need to be asked 
and if after we find out what's happened, it's clear that people have 
turned a blind eye or, worse still, connived with it, then of course 
they're going to have to be held to account and - if that turns out to 
be the case - heads will need to roll of course,' he told ITV's The 
Agenda.

Earlier this week it emerged that Savile was barred from any involvement with the BBC's Children In Need charity.

Sir Roger Jones, a former chairman of
the charity, said he had been uncomfortable about allowing Savile to 
have any association with their work.

Although he had 'no evidence' that 
Savile was up to anything, he said he behaved strangely, adding: 'I 
think we all recognised he was a pretty creepy sort of character.'

Britain's most senior police officer 
said if allegations about Jimmy Savile had been linked while he was 
alive, they would have exposed 'a pattern of behaviour'.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
Bernard Hogan-Howe said police and other organisations had not connected
a number of separate claims made about Savile's allegedly predatory 
actions.
