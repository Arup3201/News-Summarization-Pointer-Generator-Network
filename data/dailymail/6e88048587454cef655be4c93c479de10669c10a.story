Manchester City raised eyebrows when they paid £28million for Swansea's Ivorian front man Wilfried Bony.

While the 26-year-old's quality is not in doubt, his transfer fee is high considering he is unlikely to be available until February, and even then will probably be fourth choice.

But Manchester City fan Colin Ashmore of www.90min.com believes Bony could be just the player to help the club retain their Premier League crown.

Wilfried Bony, 26, joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal, he will wear the No 14 shirt

They say that £28m is a lot of money for a fourth-choice striker, but I think Wilfried Bony deserves a bit more credit than that. No player scored more goals than him during the last calendar year and the Ivory Coast forward is not some flash-in-the-pan striker; he’s managed to find the net wherever he’s been and his goalscoring record proves that.

You can argue there’s a fair bit of wilderness between the Czech league and Europe’s elite competition, where the striker is heading if Manuel Pellegrini can successfully mastermind a win over Barcelona in the Champions League – but either way Bony scores goals because he’s smart. Whether he make the step up to Champions League football so quickly and how City overcome Barcelona remains to be seen, but on paper City fans should have no reason to doubt his quality.

Bony is quick, strong and powerful. Yet, somewhat unfairly, his best qualities are often overlooked. His first touch is exceptional - I suppose it has to be when leading the line for someone of Swansea’s ilk - whether it’s with his head, chest or his preferred route; into feet, contrary to popular belief.

His movement is also first-class; perhaps the reason he scores as many as he does and why Gylfi Sigurdsson has more league assists this season than he managed in two years at Tottenham.

And keep an eye on his finishing; while the power is there if he needs it, he’s equally capable of selling a goalkeeper with his eyes and tucking one neatly inside his far corner.

As far as I’m concerned, he’s an ox with a strong grasp of ballet.

Already though, there are doubts over the Ivorian’s future at the Etihad Stadium, both long and short-term.For starters, due to international commitments, we are unlikely to see him until mid-February at the earliest - even his unveiling took place under the beaming West African sun!

Let’s assume the The Elephants reach the final of this year’s African Cup of Nations, then perhaps we could pencil in a potential debut in the FA Cup fifth round - somewhere around Valentine’s Day. That’s also envisaging the Blues beat Middlesbrough in a week and a bit’s time.

The striker leaves Swansea for £25million and will earn £100,000-a-week in wages  

You’d hope that Sergio Aguero will be banging them in again by then, with Edin Dzeko back too in all likelihood. Bony will already be playing catch-up.

But even if we don’t see too much of him before the season’s out, there’s no need to panic. Dzeko himself was a January addition and scored only two goals from eight league starts in his first-half season.

The Bosnian scored 14 the year after, 14 after that and 16 last term - all from a maximum of 23 starts (2013/14) - and I’ve no doubts that Bony will deliver too, whether it’s now or a year or so down the line.

Consider that City paid around £23m for Stevan Jovetic - a second striker whose highest ever league goals tally is 14 - then £28m for Bony doesn’t seem quite so steep.

The Ivorian needn't worry about his future at the club. Jovetic, on the other hand, I’m not so sure about. In my eyes it could prove to be a very shrewd signing by Pellegrini, especially with the games coming think and fast between now and the end of the season. Bony could well prove the difference in the title race.
