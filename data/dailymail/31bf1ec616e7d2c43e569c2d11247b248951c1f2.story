England are less than 12 months away from a home World Cup but have just lost four Tests on the trot to New Zealand and one to South Africa.

The game with Australia on Saturday week is now ‘must-win’. But do the southern-hemisphere nations agree that England are in crisis? NIK SIMON asked three legends…

It’s not time to press the panic button just yet but there was not a lot of creativity in England’s play at the weekend. 

That played into South Africa’s hands because they’re a physical side that love people running straight at them.

Owen Farrell hasn’t played a lot of rugby this season and it’s not an easy task to find your feet against New Zealand and the Springboks. Maybe he wasn’t quite ready.

I think there’s an option to have George Ford come in at No 10, with Owen at 12. It gives you more options with kicking and also two ball-players that can stand either side of the ruck. 

Defensively Owen is very strong at inside centre and he’s used to playing alongside Brad Barritt, who has been at 13. 

Maybe it’s time for Ben Youngs to have a go at scrum half against Samoa and show us what he’s got, but the most important thing is getting a win over Australia.

The Saracens fly half could be moved to inside centre, but seems unlikely to start the next game at 10

SEAN FITZPATRICK (92-cap former All Blacks skipper)

England are going through a building phase but they will be disappointed with the performance against South Africa.

They should be a bit harder on themselves but, in the context of where they were three years ago, they have made huge strides. 

As fans here we want England to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win. 

Injuries have not helped their cause and South Africa at Twickenham is a game they would have targeted as a win.

The fact that southern-hemisphere players are being contracted to their union also certainly helps, especially in the autumn. 

It makes them almost like a club team. That’s where the northern hemisphere are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere. Perhaps the RFU should look to buy out the clubs.

George Ford, who came on in both games, could start for England in the next fixture against Samoa

THINUS DELPORT (Former South Africa and Gloucester full back)

The guys all looked very nervous at Twickenham and England must learn to handle the pressure and expectation that will come over the next 12 months.

South Africa had less possession and territory in the first half but capitalised on ill-discipline and unforced errors — a lot of that is down to pressure and in particular the decision-making at 9, 10 and 12.

Unfortunately pressure is building on the England set-up from all angles.

How they handle that will be crucial to their chances of winning the World Cup. 

They can go out for a beer, but if they get caught out by the media and then the result doesn’t go their way, then it becomes the wrong thing to do. 

But it can swing both ways and England have to find that balance between focus and relaxation very quickly.

England could call on Ben Youngs to help break the malaise in the half-back positions
