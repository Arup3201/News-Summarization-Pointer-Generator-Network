A one-room former harbour master's hut is set to become one of Britain’s most expensive beach huts if it sells for the eye-watering asking price of £250,000.

The hut at Rozel Bay Quay, Jersey, boasts views across the harbour of the fishing port and as far as France.

Retired carpenter Carl Mesny, 59, is selling the hut on an informal tender basis after it was bought from his father Hedley back in the 1950s.

Mr Mesny from Pontac, Jersey, said: ‘I think it's the best beach hut in Jersey, if not Britain.

‘From the balcony you can see all across the harbour and even France. It's beautiful.

‘I think it's a lovely spot and we have definitely had some good memories here.

‘I used to stay here with the family when we were kids but we haven't been using it lately.

‘We want others to enjoy it as much as we did.’

The
tiny beach hut, which has a kitchenette, long living room, bedroom and 
fully fitted bathroom, has recently undergone a substantial 
redevelopment.

On the market for the first time in 60 years: Retired carpenter Carl Mesny, 59, is selling the hut on an informal tender basis after it was bought from his father Hedley back in the 1950s

Thompson Estates, who is promoting the sale, said: ‘This characterful property has a long living room with views across the entire Rozel harbour and the bay beyond. 

‘The kitchenette offers ample space and could accommodate a small dining table. 

‘There is a utility area and a fully fitted bathroom. 

‘An amazing opportunity to acquire this highly unusual property.’

Beach huts are increasingly commanding bigger and better price-tags, here in Britain and abroad.

A shack with uninterrupted views of Whitsand Bay, Cornwall bought by investor Adam Wooler for £6,500 is earning him £100,000 a year after a renonvation.

Holiday getaway: Mr Mesny's family have used the hut as a holiday house. He said: 'We want others to enjoy it as much as we did'

Perched on the edge of a 300ft cliff, the chalet, with triple-glazed windows and heated floors, Mr Wooler now rents out the chalet as a holiday retreat for between £1,500 and £2,900 a week.

With an occupancy rate of 80 per cent, the annual return should be around £100,000.

Nestled in the middle of the Hawaii countryside, a cosy red wooden hut is on sale for an eye-watering $2.5million (£1.64million).

The property is described a 'slice of paradise' with vistas onto the pacific and the Laupahoehoe countryside.

At only 484 square feet, the dimensions may be a little cosy, but the price tag may be helped by the 20-acres of lush Hawaiian countryside that come with it. 

With a price tag which equates to $5,165 per square foot, the property's international agent, Sotheby's, describes the tiny home as an 'exclusive hideaway'.

'Whales, dolphins, and turtles play just off shore providing occupants with endless entertainment,' its entry reads. 

A six-foot wide hut went on sale for £245,000 (around $400,000) in South Devon in November.
