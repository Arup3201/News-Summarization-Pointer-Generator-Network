A third athlete on the American Olympic delegation has revealed that he is gay.

Figure skater Brian Boitano announced that he is homosexual in a statement released today in response to his inclusion on the presidential delegation to Sochi, where Russia’s anti-gay propaganda laws will be in effect.

‘I am many things: a son, a brother and uncle, an athlete, a cook, an author and being gay is just one part of who I am,’ the 1988 Olympic gold medalist wrote.

Back on the ice: Brian Boitano, seen here at an event on December 11, won a gold medal in the 1988 Calgary games and today he came out as gay

‘First and foremost I am an American athlete and I am proud to live in a country that encourages diversity, openness and tolerance. I hope we can remain focused on the Olympic spirit which celebrates achievement in sport by peoples of all nations.’

In addition to his gold medal from the Calgary Olympics in 1988, he also came in sixth place in the 1994 games and is a two time World Champion.

He had never addressed his personal life before today, but felt compelled to do so in light of the Sochi Games.

‘It has been my experience from competing around the world and in Russia that Olympic athletes can come together in friendship, peace and mutual respect regardless of their individual country’s practices,’ he wrote.

Then and now: Boitano's career high was the gold medal win in 1988 (left) but also won two World Championships and a sixth place distinction in the 1994 games

Boitano will be one of three openly gay athletes who will be traveling to Russia as part of the delegation, which President Obama is sending in his place as neither he nor Michelle or Vice President Joe Biden will be attending.

This is the first time since 2000 that the U.S. will not send a president, former president, first lady or vice president to the Games.

France and Germany are among the other countries who will not send their presidents to Sochi for the Games.

The other two openly gay athletes who will be a part of the American delegation are tennis star Billie Jean King, who President Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, and hockey player Caitlin Cahow.

Ms King, who said she was ‘deeply honored’ to be included, will be attending the opening ceremonies while Ms Cahow will attend the closing ceremony.

Open: Hockey player Caitlin Cahow is also a lesbian and will be attending the Sochi games

'I am equally proud to stand with the members of the LGBT community in support of all athletes who will be competing in Sochi and I hope these Olympic Games will indeed be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people,' said King..

Russia has come under fierce criticism for passing national laws banning 'gay propaganda.'

Though the White House did not specifically address the Russian laws in making its announcement, spokesman Shin Inouye said the delegation 'represents the diversity that is the United States'' and that Obama 'knows they will showcase to the world the best of America - diversity, determination and teamwork.'

The White House said Obama's schedule will not permit him to attend the Games.

Earlier this fall, skier Bode Miller was one of the few American athletes to speak out against the Russian law, calling it 'absolutely embarrassing'.
