A woman escaped losing her leg by inches after she toppled onto the tracks in front of a moving train.

Had the train moved just a foot more the woman, who is in her 20s, would probably have lost her leg in the incident at Birmingham New Street station and could have been killed. 

She was found laid on her back between the tracks and the wall of the platform, with her left leg bent up behind her. 

Police and paramedics rushed to the scene after a woman fell on the tracks in front of an oncoming train 

Commuters screamed when they realised what had happened and there were later cheers when she was lifted clear from the tracks by paramedics, with no serious injuries after falling at about 6pm yesterday. 

Paramedics said if the train had rolled even 30 inches further the woman, who has not been identified, could have been very seriously hurt and possibly lost her leg.

Ben Bryce, 34, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, said: 'It was absolutely horrific. All I saw was a crowd of people gathering near the front of the train screaming.

'At first someone said the woman had been on roller blades and had lost control but I think she was actually just standing waiting for a train and lost her footing.

'It's an absolute miracle she wasn't more seriously hurt or even killed. When she was lifted clear of the train by the paramedics there was a huge cheer from people watching.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'Ambulance staff managed to get her out of the position and assessed her condition at the scene.

The woman, in her 20s, was laid flat on her back between the train and platform and escaped serious injury

'Astonishingly, she appeared to have no injury from her close shave with the train but was taken to City Hospital for further assessment.

'It is clear that, had the train gone even another foot further forwards, then we could have been looking at a totally different situation, with the potential for very serious injuries.

'She has been more than lucky.'

Suggestions that the woman had been on roller skates were dismissed after a woman who had been on the platform said they had been hers and she had put them down when she went to help the stricken commuter. 

Commuters screamed when they realised the woman fell onto the tracks and cheered when she was freed

The woman fell onto the tracks at about 6pm, as the 5.31pm Walsall to Wolverhampton train arrived at the platform. She was found with her left leg was bent back with her thigh against her body and her calf against the train. 

Paramedics found she was not seriously injured but she was taken to Birmingham City Hospital for further checks.  

London Midland is investigating the incident in conjunction with Network Rail.
