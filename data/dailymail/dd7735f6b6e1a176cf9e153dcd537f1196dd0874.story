A nine-year-old Brooklynite is fed up with street fashion and wants people to start covering their assets.

Amor 'Lilman' Arteaga and his father, Juan, penned a catchy rap titled 'Pull Ya Pants Up' to vent their frustration at the sagging back-sides they are subjected to seeing on the streets of their neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

The father-son duo even got Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz to add his voice to their pleas, with the local politician appearing in their YouTube video and declaring every day 'Pull Ya Pants Up' day in the New York City borough.

In a nearly four minute YouTube music video, reminiscent of Willow Smith's 'Whip Your Hair' single, the rising star jumps around Brooklyn pointing out fashion offenders displaying their derrieres and voicing his annoyance at seeing pants improperly secured.

'I'm tired of seeing all these dirty underwears when I am walking down the street. Pull 'em up!' he shouts.

'Think that you swaggin' cause your pants saggin' -  Pull ya pants up. Pull ya pants up,' he adds, as he shows his disgust as men with lowered shorts stroll by.

Arteaga, who is a fourth grade student 
at PS 92 school in Brooklyn, told the New York Daily
News he thinks 'it's disrespectful showing your butt off.'

Not a good look: Nine-year-old rapper Amor 'Lilman' goes after the fashion offenders in his music video

'I’m always seeing boys, girls, rappers, singers - everyone is sagging out.'

The young songster says he was inspired to pen a tune with a 'pull your pants up' theme because when he was a seven-year-old kid, he got in trouble with his father when he pants were sagging low one day when he ran around on the playground.

So the father-son duo joined forces to pen the catchy tune and they spent most of the summer coming up with the music video.

The inspiration to incorporate  Marty Markowitz came from a family friend, who urged Juan to bring his talented son to meet the local politician.

They did meet and Mr Markowitz invited Amor to perform at the Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series earlier this year, when he debuted his song 'Pull Ya Pants Up.' 

Juan Arteaga, 37, said he is really happy that his son's talent is being appreciated.

'I am so proud. I couldn't do what he is doing when I was that age,' his father said.

Though Amor is still young, he has his heart set on performing and making it big.

He wants to see his song get some radio play and dreams about seeing the rap music video appear on BET's '106 & Park' countdown show.

The youngster also says he wants to keep the message of his music positive.

'Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a star. I didn't want to go through all this nonsense of cursing. I wanted to be positive with my raps,' he told the News.

For his next project, he has his eye on gun violence. 

'There’s too many shootings. Even little people like me are getting killed. I see a lot of different things on the news. We gotta stop the killings,' he said.
