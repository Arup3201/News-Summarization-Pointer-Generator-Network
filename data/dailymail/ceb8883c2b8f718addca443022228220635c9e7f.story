Experts have said shrapnel-covered damage on the front of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is consistent with a missile hit. 

Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally, it has been reported.

Reed Foster, a defense analyst, told the New York Times that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile.

According to Mr Foster, the SA-11 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel. 

An SA-11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target.

After it has been detonated the warhead shatters creating a shrapnel cloud which hits the plane causing critical damage to the aircraft. 

The photographs show that the holes are about the same size which also supports the claim the plane was hit by shrapnel.

According to analysts, the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high-velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads

More evidence is now mounting up which backs Ukraine's claim that the aircraft carrying 298 people was shot down by mistake by pro-Russian separatists and Russian military personel with an SA-11 missile launched from a Buk-M1. 

Justin Bronk, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times: 'The size of the shrapnel holes in consistent with what one might expect to see from an SA-11 hit. 

'However it is difficult to assess the total blast pattern with such a small fragment of fuselage.

Douglas Barrie, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, also said the damage caused was consistent with the kind of damage you would expect from the detonation of a warhead. 

An Australian air force plane and refrigerated trucks have now arrived in Holland to wait for the MH17 victims but it is now feared only 200 bodies have been recovered.

There were 298 people on board the doomed aircraft.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also says there are still human remains lying on the crash site.

Jain Tuinder, a Dutch official leading the investigation, said just 200 bodies had arrived in Kharkiv today adding: 'We will not leave until every remain has left this country so we will have to go on and bargain again with the people over there.’  

It has also emerged that the cockpit is believed to have been sawn in half while under the control of Russian-backed separatists.
