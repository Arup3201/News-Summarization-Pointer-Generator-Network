Criticised: Leading doctors say shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (pictured) was 'misguided' when he demanded a moratorium on new NHS contracts being signed with private companies

Leading doctors say Labour would put patients ‘at great risk’ through its plans to restrict the number of private firms running NHS services.

In a letter to the Daily Mail, the senior medics say services could worsen if the Health Service is not able to make use of the best providers.

They say shadow health secretary Andy Burnham was ‘misguided’ this week when he demanded a moratorium on new contracts being signed with charities and private companies.

Mr Burnham said the Government’s ‘privatisation’ agenda was ‘indefensible’.

He called for all pending NHS contracts with the private sector to be put on hold until the next election – except where there would otherwise be a threat to the provision of services.

But critics accused him of hypocrisy, pointing out that Mr Burnham’s term as Health Secretary saw a big increase in the use of private firms to provide services, run treatment centres and build hospitals.

Now he has come under attack from senior doctors, including Dr Michael Dixon, president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, the body which represents GPs in charge of NHS budgets.

Several GPs who chair local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have added their names to the letter, which is published on Mail Online.

They wrote: ‘As doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our patients, we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this week by Andy Burnham. They would put patients and services at great risk.’

The doctors said it was ‘absolutely untrue’ to suggest there was any kind of privatisation agenda within CCGs – or that they are forced to contract out for every service.

They say the amount of NHS care commissioned from the private sector is in fact less than 6 per cent.

‘Local GPs groups must retain the freedom to make use of innovation, experience and investment from all sectors to improve patient care,’ they said.

Last night a Labour spokesman said: ‘NHS spending on private firms broke the £10billion barrier last year – much higher than 6 per cent.’

'As doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our 
patients, we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this 
week by the Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham. They would put 
patients and services at great risk.
 
'GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), now responsible for 
commissioning local health services, are improving population health and
 also living within their budgets by embracing localism and partnership 
working.

'It is absolutely untrue to suggest there is any kind of 
‘privatisation’ agenda within CCGs or that we are forced to contract out
 for every service. The amount of NHS care commissioned from the private
 sector is today less than 6%, having grown slowly but steadily for ten 
years.
 
'Local GPs groups must retain the freedom to make use of innovation, 
experience and investment from all sectors to improve patient care. As 
both the previous Labour government and the current coalition have made 
clear, we must move on from the old debates about 'public versus 
private' and provider whatever is best for patients.

'To argue that 
charities or private companies should be allowed a role in bringing down
 waiting lists but not in supporting improved patient care is misguided.
 
'It should also be noted that guidance issued in March 2010 by Andy 
Burnham when he was Health Secretary also makes clear that a 'preferred 
provider' policy which favours state-owned organisations is illegal 
under European law.

'This week’s announcement will cause confusion for 
CCGs at a time when politicians should be supporting and trusting the 
hard work of local GP-led commissioning groups.
