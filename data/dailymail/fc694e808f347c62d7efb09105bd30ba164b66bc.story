Police investigating the historic murders of a Playboy bunny and a London schoolgirl have launched a fresh appeal for information on the 40th anniversary of their deaths.

Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of March 18, 1975.

Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was brutally attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends.

She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later.

Both murders were linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. 

Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer.

Miss Stratford, worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966.

She was 22 when she was raped and killed in her home. 

Her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. 

Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body.

She was found with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back.

She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March.

She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. 

A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. 

Later that year, on September 3, Lynne Weedon was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. 

She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. 

A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later.

The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered.

Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead

Lynne's mother Margaret Weedon has now made an impassioned plea for information as the anniversary of her daughter's death approaches.

She said: 'It has been 40 years since our beautiful young daughter Lynne was violently taken from us.

'1975 seems so long ago and it is. Forty years without her. We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her.

'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like - a true life sentence.' 

Mrs Weedon added: 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence.'

Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said the suspect for both murders is likely to be in his 60s or 70s.

He added: 'The man who carried out these murders is now of a different, older generation. I would imagine he must have reflected upon his actions every day over the past 40 years.

'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.'

Police believe the killer would have known of the Hounslow area - the alleyway and sub-station where Lynne was found were away from busy areas and meant her screams would have not been heard.

Mrs Weedon said: 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.'

Last week, former detective Colin Sutton pinned a third unsolved murder on the man who murdered Miss Stratford and Lynne. 

Mr Sutton, who solved the Levi Bellfield and Night Stalker cases, believes Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer.

He told the Sun: 'I have no doubt the same man committed all three.'

'I was quickly struck by the similarities with that of Eve Stratford.

'A woman killed in her own home by having her throat slit? That is rare enough today — in the 1970s it was almost unheard of.

'For this to have happened twice, with identical wounds, within a few miles of each other was just too much of a coincidence.'

He added: 'My gut feeling tells me he (the killer) is still out there some where and still nervous about a knock on his door.'  

Ms Farrow, a mother-of-two, was pregnant when she was stabbed to death at her home in Woodford, Essex, on January 19, 1979. 

When her daughters Sam, 11, and Justine, eight, returned from school at 3.30pm they found the door locked and looked through the letterbox where they saw their mother's body face down in the hall.

The blood-stained murder weapon, a serrated carving knife, was found in the kitchen. 

Witnesses described seeing a man lingering in the area, wearing a check lumber jacket and cowboy hat. But he was never traced.
