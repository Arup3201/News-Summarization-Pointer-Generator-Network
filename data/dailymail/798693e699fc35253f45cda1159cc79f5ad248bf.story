A mother who pretended to have cancer and even shaved her head to fool those who gave money to support her has been jailed.

Kimberlie Gustwiller, 39, was sentenced to nine months on Friday after pleading guilty to falsely collecting $9,000 from her generous community to pay off medical bills. 

Gustwiller, from Ohio, set up an online campaign last year called 'Support Kimmie' where she claimed to be suffering from Stage IV non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and posted numerous pictures of herself with a partially shaved head and dyed pink mohawk.

The mother-of-five can be seen with the hairstyle in her police mug shot after officers swooped in North Baltimore and arrested her on theft charges in September 2012.

Police soon realized that she did not have cancer when they received her medical records and had scammed local residents out of thousands of dollars.

Police Chief Allan Baer told northwestohio.com at the time: 'To be honest, this whole community was pretty much hoodwinked.'

Gustwiller, who appeared in court with a coiffed blonde hairstyle, told the judge last week that she had been an addict when she concocted the scam.

Judge Alan Mayberry said that he wished 
he could sentence her to a longer term as her fake cancer battle was an 
insult to those fighting the disease.

The town of North Baltimore, which only has around 4,000 residents, banded together to support the mother and her children, donating through the website and holding silent auctions and other events.

Gustwiller also told locals that she had already overcome a battle with ovarian cancer which was also a lie.

She was ordered to pay back close to $5,000 in donations she received along with her jail term.
