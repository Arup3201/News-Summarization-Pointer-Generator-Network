Bristol Crown Court was told cyclist Gareth Pitt (pictured) punched an off-duty policeman

A cyclist fractured a driver’s eye socket in a bout of road rage - not realising his victim was an off-duty policeman, a court heard.

Gareth Pitt, 53, punched Paul Wiltshire, who was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt at the time, as the pair argued on the pavement, it was said.

A jury heard how PC Wiltshire needed surgery to his fractured left eye socket, which gave him double vision for months after the incident.

Mr Pitt, of St Jude’s, Bristol, denies causing grievous bodily harm on May 20 last year at his trial at Bristol Crown Court, claiming he acted in self-defence.

The court heard the spat began when Pitt, who had been at his girlfriend’s house on a nearby road, went for an evening bike ride.

As he cycled down Ketch Road, Bristol, he saw a blue car performing a manoeuvre which blocked part of both lanes.

Mr Pitt, who believed the driving was 'poor and inconsiderate', then asked PC Wiltshire: 'What do you think you’re doing, you idiot?', admitting he swore in the process.

The pair exchanged words again further down the road and Pitt told the jury that after PC Wiltshire verbally abused him he swore and accused the officer of cutting him up.

Mr Pitt then pulled over on the busy main road and asked PC Wiltshire: 'Do you want some?', the jury heard.

The court was told how the officer, who is based in Southmead, a suburb of Bristol, then parked and approached Mr Pitt. However, PC Wiltshire denied provoking the cyclist.

Mr Pitt told the jury: 'I was scared. I just felt I had to say something.

'I was hoping to scare him off.'

He added: 'I don’t pretend it was a particularly brilliant strategy, but it was what I did.

'I felt my body space was definitely invaded. He started mocking me by saying in a silly voice, "do you want some then, do you want some?"

'It was an impulse gesture, it felt like a fight or flight response I suppose. I struck him because I thought he was going to hit me.'

He then alleged that after the punch PC Wiltshire kicked the bike - although the officer denies this.

PC Wiltshire told the court he was in 'excruciating pain' as he attempted to restrain Mr Pitt until he could be arrested.

He said: 'I couldn’t see out of my left eye at all. I had no idea what injuries he’d caused to me.'

Witness Christopher Samuel told the jury he had seen a man in a bicycle helmet suddenly 'flail his arms' at another man, who had put him in a 'bear hug'.

Nicholas Flook, a worker at nearby Avon Tyres, said: 'I saw the cyclist hit the gentleman in the side of the head with a clenched fist.'

Donna Hennessy said she saw PC Wiltshire cover his face as he tried to protect himself, but that he then got Mr Pitt in a tight headlock.

She added: 'I thought he was going to actually snap his neck, that’s how much force he was using.'

A verdict in the case is expected today.
