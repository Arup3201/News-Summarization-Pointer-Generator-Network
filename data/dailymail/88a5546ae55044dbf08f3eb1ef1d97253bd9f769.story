Nestled deep in the Western Australian bush is a species of tiny jumping spider that takes part in an elaborate and colourful dance. 

The dramatic-looking peacock spiders appear to be getting ready to attack, but this colourful display is designed to attract a mate.

It is similar to peacock birds, where the species of spider gets its nickname from, and the ritual is a rare sight to be caught on camera.

Peacock spiders can only be found in Australia, and 
this particular species - Maratus avibus - is only found at one 
location, near Cape Arid, Western Australia.

When a male peacock spider senses a 
female it begins the mating ritual by lifting its legs and flashing 
its stomach in a sequence that looks like a dance routine.

The
 females carefully study the colouring, vibrations and movements of the 
male to make sure the potential suitor is healthy and the correct 
species to mate with.

Once 
he has mated, he will repeat this dance with as many females as he can 
find and Maratus spiders can have multiple partners at one time. 

These images were captured by biologist Dr Jurgen 
Otto and friend David Knowles near Esperance, Western Australia.

The tiny 4.5mm spider is also known as the Maratus avibus.

The males' abdomen is made up of blue, red and green eye-catching
 flaps.

Dr Otto, 48, said: 'The reason they have such elaborate flaps or fans is simply to appear attractive to a female.

'Only the male possess these flaps and he displays them to the female during a brief courtship dance. It is similar to what happens with birds of paradise or peacocks.

'The
 males do not discriminate between the females of different species and 
will display their bright bodies to females that belong to other 
species.'

Dr Otto, from Sydney, Australia, did not even know the spider, pictured, existed before he discovered it in October: 'There are many unnamed species in this group, some of these are already known to a few scientists or photographers but they have not yet been named'

It was first thought the flaps, pictured, helped the spiders glide. They were initially nicknamed gliding spiders, but research ruled this out

'I am certain there are many others in existence that nobody has ever seen, but
 the design on the spider's abdomen looks like two birds facing each 
other - which made experts choose the name 'avibus', meaning 'birds.''

The tiny, colourful spiders all come 
from the Maratus genus of arachnids, and are members of the Salticidae 
family of jumping spiders.

It was first thought that the colourful stomach flaps were used to help the jumping Maratus spiders glide.

As a result, they were initially 
nicknamed gliding spiders.

However, research has ruled this out and the 
display is thought to be mainly for mating.
