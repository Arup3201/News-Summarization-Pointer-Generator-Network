The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday it was making contingency plans in case all 400,000 inhabitants of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani fled into Turkey to escape advancing Islamic State militants.

Some 138,000 Syrian Kurdish refugees have entered southern Turkey in an exodus that began last week, and two border crossing points remain open, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.

'We are preparing for the potential of the whole population fleeing into Turkey. Anything could happen and that population of Kobani is 400,000,' UNHCR chief spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told a news briefing in Geneva.

'We don't know if all of those people will flee, but we are preparing for that contingency,' she said.

The United States and Arab allies bombed Syria for the first time on Tuesday, killing dozens of Islamic State fighters and members of a separate al Qaeda-linked group, pursuing a campaign against militants into a war at the heart of the Middle East.

Army General Martin Dempsey said the raids in northern Syria - which employed Tomahawk missiles, B1 bombers, F16, F18 and F22 strike fighters and drones - will have successfully proved to the radical Islamists that even strongholds such as the city of Raqqa do not represent a 'safe haven'.

American air power was backed by 'participation or support' from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the UAE - a coalition of nations that has agreed to assist with the destruction of ISIS - with Britain not involved in the overnight strikes.

There was also a U.S. attack on a separate band of Islamist militants in Syria - the Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group, who were said to have been planning an 'imminent attack' on a Western target. 

On Monday, Syrian Kurds battled to defend the key border town of Kobani from an Islamic State advance as Kurdish youths from Turkey rushed to their aid.

A first airlift of supplies for up to 200,000 people is due to arrive at Adana airport from Amman, Jordan on Wednesday, to be followed by three more flights later in the week, Fleming said.

Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements

Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, told the briefing on Tuesday: 'Our biggest worry at the moment would be if Kobani itself, the town, fell.'

At least 105 villages around Kobani have been captured by Islamic State forces since Sept. 15, including at least 85 over the weekend, he said. The U.N. rights office had reports that an additional 100 villages had been abandoned or evacuated for fear of being captured, he said.

'We have received very alarming reports of deliberate killing of civilians, including women and children, the abduction of hundreds of Kurds by ISIL, and widespread looting and destruction of infrastructure and private property,' he said, using another name for the Sunni militant group.

 Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arab participation was essential for Obama as he looked to expand the American campaign of air strikes to Syria from Iraq, where the U.S. military has already carried out 190 strikes as of Monday.

Several Arab countries have offered to join the United States in air strikes against Islamic State targets, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sept. 14.

But the United States has so far refused to detail which nations have given private assurances to Washington that they would join in air strikes in Syria, part of a broader strategy against the Islamic State that includes training and arming moderate Syrian opposition fighters.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in television interviews over the weekend that other nations were willing to join air strikes in Syria. 

Vital allies: All the U.S. partners in the airstrikes against Syria are Middle Eastern nations. They are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Bahrain.

'I will make you a prediction,' Power said on ABC. 'We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.'

Several Arab states have powerful air forces, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, for example, has also already agreed to host U.S. training of Syrian opposition fighters.

But many Gulf Arab states have been reluctant to be seen aggressively joining the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, fearing in some cases reprisals by extremists or forces loyal to the Syrian government.

The White House last week declined to 'telegraph' when strikes might occur or what preconditions stood in the way.

Obama will give a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State.

The Kobani region, which has some 440 villages, is also host to between 200,000 and 400,000 Syrians displaced from other parts of the country including Raqqa, Aleppo and Homs, he said.

'So potentially the population movement could be much greater than it's been already even though it's been very large and very fast,' Colville said.

Turkish authorities are checking arriving Syrians to ensure they are not fighters, 'to maintain the civilian character of asylum', Fleming said. Young Syrian children are also being checked for measles and polio vaccinations, she said.

Fleming called for support for the government of Turkey and other neighbouring countries - Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Egypt - that are already hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees.

'If you want to put it into proportion, this 138,000 that just arrived in Turkey represents about the number that all of Europe has taken in in the three years of the Syria war,' she said.
