High street stalwart Jessops is on the verge of collapse.

The photography chain looks likely to become the first major retail failure of the New Year after appointing administrators today.

Branch closures are said to be ‘inevitable’ and the future appears grim for the 2,000 staff at the company’s 200 stores.

Camera specialist Jessops could soon be 2013's first major High street casualty

And customers who bought products in the run-up to Christmas will struggle to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods.

It appears that poor festive trading 
was the final nail in the coffin for a Britain’s only specialist 
nationwide camera retailer, a fixture on High Streets for almost 80 
years.

Jessops has struggled to cope with changes in technology, specifically the shift to digital technology.

Most smartphones now have powerful 
cameras built into them, which means families have no need of a separate
device.

And most people store and share their photographs digitally 
rather than paying to print them. PwC’s Rob Hunt said his firm was 
holding discussions with stakeholders to see if the business could be 
preserved.

He said: ‘Trading in the stores is hoped to continue, but is 
critically dependent on these ongoing discussions. However, it is 
inevitable that there will be store closures.’

Jessops was tonight offering its 
gift vouchers, despite administrators saying they would no longer be 
accepted. The gift cards – available in denominations between £20 and 
£500 – were on sale on the retailer’s website.

Administrator PwC said Jessops was not
in a position to honour the vouchers at present, and it would also not 
accept returned goods.

PwC said the company’s core market had
seen a ‘significant decline’ in 2012 and its position had 
‘deteriorated’ in the run-up to Christmas, as a result of reducing 
confidence in UK retail.

Forecasts for 2013 indicated the 
decline would continue, PwC added. It said extra funding was made 
available to the company, but Jessops did not generate the profits it 
had planned over Christmas.

Mr Hunt said discussions to raise 
additional financial support had been held between the directors, 
lenders and suppliers over the past few days. But the directors had 
appointed administrators in light of ‘irreconcilable differences’.

1935 - Jessops started trading when Frank Jessop opened his first store in Leicester selling 16mm cine films. The business expanded significantly when Frank’s son Alan Jessop came on board, and set about transforming it into a cut-price retailer of photographic equipment.

1970s - Jessops moves to a new 20,000 sq ft site on Leicester's Hinckley Road, which is later named as the largest photography store in the world by Guinness World Records.

1980 - A second store is opened on the Finchley Road in London. By the end of the decade the retailer had 50 stores.

1996 - Alan Jessop retires and firm is sold in a management buyout.

2001 - The 200th store opened in July. The retailer had expanded to cover Aberdeen to Penzance, as well as stores in Jersey, Guernsey and Ireland.

2002 - ABN AMRO acquired a controlling interest in the business.

2004 - The retailer was floated on the London Stock Exchange. 

2008 - Jessops' Hinckley Road premises in Leicester is closed.

2009 - Jessops narrowly avoided administration by securing a debt-for-equity swap with its lenders HSBC.

2012 - The retailer made losses of £5.2million, when it also lost both its chief executive Trevor Moore and chairman David Adams. 

The chain was launched in 1935 by Frank Jessop, who opened the first photography store in Leicester.

But the firm has had a rocky few 
years. It managed to avoid administration in 2009 after its bank wiped 
out its debts in return for a 47 per cent stake in the business.

A number of household names – Comet, 
Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, Clinton Cards, and JJB Sports – all 
went into administration in 2012 and the British Retail Consortium has 
warned the pattern could continue into 2013.

BRC Director general Helen Dickinson 
said: ‘If you look at the amount of money people have got in their 
pockets, that is expected to continue to be under pressure.’

Jessops looks likely to become one of
several household names that has fallen into administration in recent 
months as struggling families cut down on spending.

The number of High Street chains
going bust has increased by almost a
fifth in two years, figures released last week showed.

Some 194 stores and chains fell into
administration during 2012, compared
to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010,
according to data from Deloitte.

Everything must go: Last year saw the demise of La Senza, left, and Comet, right, among others, as consumers cut back on their spending in 2012

Last year saw the demise of Comet,
La Senza and Clinton Cards, with JJB
Sports, Blacks and Game also entering
administration.

But the number going under in the
run-up to Christmas dropped, with 37
chains folding in the final three months
of 2012, compared with 42 in the same
period in 2011.

Should
Jessops go fully into administration it will mark the first high profile 
retail collapse of 2013, with others certain to follow.

■ Online retailer Play.com is to shut down its retail business and become solely a marketplace for other retailers from March.

The Jersey-based company blamed the end of the Value Consignment Relief loophole which allowed items under £15 to be sold to the UK VAT free from the Channel Islands.
