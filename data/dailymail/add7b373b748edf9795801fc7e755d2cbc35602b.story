Brazilian ace Neymar believes Barcelona's wealth of attacking riches can help them win La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey this season.

Barcelona are currently top of the domestic pile as Luis Enrique's side continues to make the most of Real Madrid's recent slump in form under Carlo Ancelotti.

The two Spanish heavyweights go head-to-head in 'El Clasico' on March 22, and Neymar admits they will treat the match like a final as they strive to win the treble.

'We will give everything to win. I don't want to choose one title, I want to win all three.

'We try and hurt opposition defences, every day we understand each other more. They are great players.
