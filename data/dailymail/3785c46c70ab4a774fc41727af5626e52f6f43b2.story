They say opposites attract and one loved-up couple really are proof of that.

A recovering anorexic and a morbidly obese man are getting married - just months after meeting at an eating disorder clinic.

Lizzie Elsburg, 24, was just 6st 5lb when she was admitted to rehab for anorexia and bulimia, while Chris Glasgow, 28, was a 35st overeater.

Opposites attract: Former anorexic Lizzie Elsburg and fiance Chris Glasgow, who she met in an eating disorder clinic are set to wed

The couple, who met in August 2012 and bonded at counselling sessions for their very different eating problems, began dating in January this year, and became engaged in February.

Their whirlwind relationship shocked family and friends but now the couple are living near each other in Lizzie's hometown of Lorton, Virginia, and planning their future.

Lizzie, now a healthy nine stone, said: 'At first I was a bit afraid of Chris. I couldn't understand how anyone could let themselves get to that size.

'But after a while I got to know the person inside. I was able to see past his body issues, because I have body issues too.'

Weighing in: Lizzie Elsburg, 24, weighed just six and a half stone when she met 30 stone Chris Glasgow, 28, during therapy sessions at Pacific Shores Hospital in California

Where it all began: Lizzie Elsburg and fiance Chris Glasgow on the day they met at Pacific Shores Hospital in 2012 in California, they are now planning to get married

Chris, a junk food addict with low self-esteem, said: 'When I found out through a friend that Lizzie liked me, I was really shocked.

'I didn't think any girl would ever find me attractive, let alone one as beautiful as Lizzie. There's no way I would ever hit on a girl like her in the past because I would have thought she'd just laugh at me.'

During mealtimes at the clinic, Lizzie, who once ate 100 calories per day, had to piled her plate with food.

True love: The couple became engaged at a park near the clinic, Pacific Shores Hospital, in Oxnard, California, after Chris got down on one knee and proposed

Better together: Lizzie Elsburg, 24, weighed just six and a half stone when she met her fiance, they helped each other battle their eating disorders

Unexpected: 'I went to an eating disorder clinic to lose weight, and came out with the love of my life' says Lizzie

Meanwhile Chris, who binged on five takeaways per day, has so far lost 5st after he was was limited to muesli, salad, and a small side plate of food for dinner.

Lizzie admitted: 'It was a little weird at first. It felt like we should swap plates.

'But we recognised that we were both determined to beat our eating disorders - and that's what drew us together.'

'I barely got the question out when she excitedly said yes,' he said.

Skeptical: Lizzie says her friends found their relationship strange at first but now are very happy for the couple

Common goal: The pair recognised that they were both determined to beat their eating disorders - and that's what drew them together

'I went to an eating disorder clinic to lose weight, and came out with the love of my life.'

Now the couple are learning to cope with their eating disorders in the outside world and still receive weekly counselling sessions to deal with their emotional issues.

'I use food by cutting it out, he uses food by overdoing it, so it's the opposite but serves the same purpose,' said Lizzie.

Lizzie is helping Chris in his diet and exercise regime - and even set him an ultimatum in case he falls back into his old ways.

Different diets: Chris, who binged on five takeaways per day, was limited to muesli, salad, and a small side plate of food for dinner whereas Lizzie was encouraged to eat more

Big plans: The couple are planning to move in together soon, and have a medium-sized wedding next summer

'If he doesn't lose the weight then I won't marry him,' she revealed.

'If he went back to eating fast food and junk food the relationship wouldn't work from a health standpoint and from a point of physical attraction.'

Instead of being hurt, Chris is determined, and said: 'There's a lot on the line. But it makes me realise just how important it is to stay on track.'

Meanwhile, the couple are planning to move in together soon, and have a medium-sized wedding next summer, with rustic-themed colours of mint and navy.

Warning: Lizzie has warned Chris that if he doesn't lose weight, she won't marry him

Family support: Lizzie's mother was worried they rushed into their relationship but is now very happy for them

'A lot of my friends were surprised at first, but they're excited for me now,' said Lizzie.

'No-one has said anything negative about how we look together or anything,' she insisted.

Lizzie's mother Susan added: 'I really did want them to slow down and get to know each other.

'But they're doing well, so I'm happy for them.'Â
