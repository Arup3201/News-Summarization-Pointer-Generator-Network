Cancer survivor Joe Thompson has slammed Tranmere for not renewing his contract after battling back from the life-threatening disease.

The 25-year-old was diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s lymphoma last October, but was given the all-clear in June after completing a course of chemotherapy.

Thompson’s contract at Prenton Park expired this summer and he was full of anticipation of a fresh deal being offered and reviving his career.

However, the former Rochdale trainee claims he was astonished no one from the club contacted to negotiate a new contract.

'I’ve not spoken to any of the decision makers from Tranmere,' said Thompson. 'I’ve just spoken to one or two members of the coaching staff.

'The medical team from the club have been in touch with my doctors throughout my recovery process to check how I’m doing, but I’ve not had a call from the manager, the chief executive or anything like that.

'I’m disappointed that they have not contacted me or offered me anything. I thought morally, that something would have been done.

'Even a short-term deal for like three months or something, but it's football, and you have to move on.

'The Tranmere fans were brilliant, top class – they helped me massively through it all. They gave me loads of support and sent gifts to the club and got involved with my campaign.

'Together we raised over £20,000 for cancer research and I will never forget that they were there during my lowest moments.

'The club will probably say they paid me in full for a year, when I was of no use to them. But it still leaves a bad taste that I have not had a call from anyone. I feel sad but football and life moves on. I have no enemies at Tranmere, I made good friends there.'

Moving on: Thompson is looking forward to playing under Flitcroft at Bury

Thompson announced on his Twitter account over the weekend that he had signed for League Two rivals Bury after taking part in their pre-season training camp in the Canary Islands.

Shakers manager, Dave Flitcroft, was sufficiently impressed with his displays to offer the wide man a pay-as-you-play deal.

He added: 'I was in Tenerife for eight days with the guys doing pre-season training.

'It was tough; we were doing three sessions a day. But I felt good, the power is coming back.

'The Bury manager is my old assistant manager from Rochdale and knows me from there. He’s very ambitious, and wants to go for it and get promoted this year. He wants to play attacking football and I just thought "I want to be part of that".

'I can’t thank him and the chairman Stewart Day enough for giving me this opportunity to get my life back on track.

'The PFA have been a massive help during this ordeal - John Bramhall in particular. I can’t thank him enough. As has my agent Gary Lloyd, his support has been constant during this nightmare year. Tranmere did say they would speak to the PFA but they haven’t.

'There loss is Bury’s gain. Life moves on. I couldn’t sit on the sofa waiting for a call that might not have come. I had to do what’s best for me and my family.'

Tranmere, though, insists they have not been given the opportunity to discuss fresh terms with Thompson and that they have been nothing but supportive through the process, and hinted the delay in sorting a new contract is not their doing.

Speaking last week before their friendly with Everton, Rovers manager Rob Edwards said: 'I have spoken to the chief executive about the current situation with Joe.

'We are still waiting for the PFA to come back to us about a meeting we have requested that includes Joe, his agent and the PFA to talk about Joe’s future.

'Once we have the meeting we can move forward, but we want to do everything correctly and professionally.

'In the meantime we have offered Joe the opportunity to carry out his rehab with us.'
