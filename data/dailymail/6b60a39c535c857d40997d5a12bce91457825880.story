These are the shocking images of a knife-wielding raider attempting to stab a convenience store worker during a terrifying robbery.

The man entered the shop on Balham High Road at 1.45am on Wednesday February 18 before threatening the lone staff member.

The attacker jabbed his ten-inch knife at the man several times, forcing his 27-year-old victim to open the till. 

The raider, pictured, placed his hand on the counter as he threatened the staff member with a knife, possibly leaving behind vital forensic evidence which could help secure his eventual prosecution

He waved the weapon towards the shopkeeper's face, demanding he open the till (left and right)

The Metropolitan Police confirmed the victim suffered an injury to his right hand before opening the till. 

Once the till was open, the terrified shop worker retreated away from the knife man, who took several notes from the drawer. 

CCTV footage of the raid show the shop worker was lucky to escape serious injury. 

However, officers investigating the raid are hopeful the man can be caught due to the quality of the CCTV. 

The raider, who does not appear to be wearing gloves, may have left fingerprints at the scene of the crime. 

After grabbing the cash, the man ran out of the shop and turned right onto Balham High Road. He was last seen running along Oldridge Road, SW12.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the victim suffered an injury to his right hand before being forced to open the till 

Detective Constable Farmer, from Wandsworth CID, said: 'Fortunately the victim was not seriously injured and just received a slight injury to his hand. However, the robbery was a terrifying experience for him.

'Although the suspect had his face covered we have some very clear CCTV of the robbery and we are hoping someone will recognise him. 

'The suspect used a significant level of violence and on several occasions is seen to lunge the knife towards the victim's neck. We need help to identify him to bring him to justice as soon as possible.'

The raider is described as a black man in his early 20s and approximately 5ft 10 inches tall.
