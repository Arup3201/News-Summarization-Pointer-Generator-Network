Masked pickaxe-wielding bandits made off with an estimated $2 million in precious gems and gold from a mining museum in California during a brazen daytime robbery on Friday.

At least two men violently threatened workers and corralled visitors into a corner at Mariposa's Mining and Minerals Museum before attempting to snatch their prized Fricot Nugget that weighs nearly 14lbs.

Despite tripping an alarm that closed the doors to the famed crystalline goldâ€™s vaulted room the men were able to escape while taking with them several other valuable items from smashed cases, the California Highway Patrol said.

Under attack: California's Mining and Mineral Museum reported losing approximately $2 million in gold and other gems after two masked men stormed the display cases with pickaxes

Prized possession: The Fricot Nugget weighing 13.8 pounds is the largest remaining intact mass of crystalline gold dating back to the California gold rush but was nearly stolen on Friday

The news of the historic nugget's thwarted robbery attempt, the largest remaining intact mass of crystalline gold discovered in the Gold Rush era, was the sole good news for the museum that approximated losing millions in other gems with no suspects identified.

The two museum employees who were onsite during the crime were not injured, but they remained shaken from the experience, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, which operates the facility, said in a news release.

Officials have closed the museum while they repair display cases and other items damaged by the robbers. Meanwhile, the parks department was busy conducting an inventory of the stolen items.

The heist was more bad news for the beleaguered museum, which is home to more than 13,000 artefacts.

Crime scene: The California State Mining and Mineral Museum in Mariposa reported the men entering around 4pm while museum visitors were present

More hardships: The heist was more bad news for the beleaguered museum, home to more than 13,000 artefacts, as they were previously on a state list of facilities considered for closure to save money

It was previously on a state list of facilities being considered for closure to help save money by the end of July.

In a miraculous safe, on July 20th the Parks Department presented $54 million previously unreported to budget officials according to the Los Angeles Times, keeping them at least temporarily open.

Authorities said the unique pieces taken would be easily identified, which could make it difficult for the robbers to sell.

'It is uncommon for most citizens to possess such minerals,' the CHP said in a statement.

Despite this there's a fear the crooks would melt them down, entirely ruining their historical valuable.

'They probably would take them to an 
oxyacetylene torch and just melt it down into blobs of gold which would 
be an absolute travesty,' James Hutchings of the Roseville Rock Rollers 
told Fox40.

'It would be a matter of seconds to take a very large nugget and turn it into a nugget of melted gold,' he said.

It was the second heist this year of rare, valuable metals in Northern California.

In February, thieves made off with large chunks of gold that were on display in a Siskiyou County courthouse.

Investigators were trying to determine if there is a connection between the two heists.
