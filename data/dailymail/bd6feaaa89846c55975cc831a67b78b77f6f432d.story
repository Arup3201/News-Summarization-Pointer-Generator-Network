A grandfather is facing manslaughter charges after allegedly feeding his one-year-old grandson juice containing crushed morphine and Benadryl.

Gregg Busby, 59, told police that he gave Antonio Garcia-Lazarski the juice to ‘calm him down and make him feel better.’

When Antonio’s grandmother went to check on him later that night, the baby was unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene.

Arrested: Greg Busby, 59, was charged with manslaughter after giving his one-year-old grandson juice laced with morphine and Benadryl

Fatal dose: Antonio Garcia-Lazarski was already on medication for a chronic condition; he was pronounced dead at the scene

Busby, who has an extensive criminal record, was arraigned by video yesterday as a fourth-time offender.

He was looking after Antonio while his mother, Casey Lazarski, was out of town. 

Kent County Sheriff’s Dept Undersheriff Jon Hess told Grand Rapids Press that the boy’s father was ‘not in the picture.’

The infant had a hereditary disease, and was taking medication for chronic granulomatous.

The disease, which affects the heart and lungs, is an inherited disorder and occurs when immune cells are unable to kill certain harmful bacteria. 

Busby told police that he gave Antonio the medicine to calm him down – however, neither the morphine nor the Benadryl - an over-the-counter allergy medication - were part of Antonio’s pill regimen.

In fact, the morphine belonged to Antonio’s grandmother, who also lives at the mobile home in Gaines Township.

She has not been charged in her grandson’s death. Mr Hess said that it was unclear if the medicine was prescribed.

Mr Hess told wzzm13.com about the order of events: ‘The grandfather had taken some morphine and some Benadryl, crushed it, and put it in juice hoping to calm the one-year-old.

'The one-year-old subsequently died from that mixture.’

He added: ‘It’s hard for any of us to understand.’

According to wsbt.com, Busby was released from jail last October after serving a 20-year sentence for counterfeiting and check fraud.

He also tried to escape from prison in 1992.

Busby, whose first name is sometimes spelled with only one ‘G,’ was charged with manslaughter, and held on a $50,000 cash bond. His preliminary exam is scheduled for April 9.

Fatal combination: An autopsy revealed Antonio had both Benadryl, an allergy medication, and morphine  in his system

According to Russ Martin, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, Busby told authorities about the drugs only after Antonio’s autopsy results came back on March 6.

The medical examiner had found traces of both drugs in the boy’s system.

First responders arrived at Busby’s mobile home in February after they reported that little Antonio wasn’t breathing.

According to a police affidavit, Antonio was ‘cold to the touch’ when paramedics arrived. They found the boy’s grandmother, Dawn Lazarski, administering CPR.

Hess told mlive.com that it is ‘for the courts to decide’ whether or not Busby had malicious intent.

He added: ‘Any of us standing here would have to really, consciously think what the purpose was.’
