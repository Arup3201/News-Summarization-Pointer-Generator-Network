Honda is recalling more than 321,000 small SUVs and cars around the world over fears that the doors may not close properly and could even open while driving.

The car manufacturer said on Thursday that if the inside driver or passenger door handles are used at the same time as the power or manual door locks, the inner door latch may not work.

This means a door may not lock and could open while the car is in use.

The recall affects 166,600 CR-Vs and more than 6,200 ILXs in the U.S.

The recall affects 314,000 CR-V small 
SUVs from the 2012 model year and about 7,300 Acura ILX small luxury 
cars from the 2013 model year.

The company says that no accidents or injuries have been reported but federal law requires quick action when a potential safety issue is discovered - even if there have not been any problems reported by owners.

Honda says dealers will inspect the cars and fix them if needed. Owners should get letters from the company starting in mid-August.

The news came as a blow to Honda, just one day after the company announced it is ramping up production in the U.S. and expects to double its exports on vehicles made in America over the next few years.

The manufacturer currently plans to export about 100,000 units to markets in Europe, South America and Asia, this year.

Rick Schostek, senior vice president 
of Honda of America Manufacturing, said on Wednesday: 'That number will 
double in the next couple of years.'

He said that in 2011 Honda's operations in the U.S. exported 53,000 units outside North America.

Mr Schostek also announced that the 
company will invest $40m in an Indiana plant thus increasing annual 
production capacity by 50,000 units to produce a total of 250,000 cars.

Honda staged more recalls than any other carmaker in 2011.
