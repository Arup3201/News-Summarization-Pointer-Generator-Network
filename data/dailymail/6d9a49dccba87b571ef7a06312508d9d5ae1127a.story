A transgender woman has told of her joy after internet users paid for her to have a vagina.

Samantha Allen said she is used to receiving abuse online, so could not believe it when she raised the $8,000 needed for her surgery in less than 24 hours.

Ms Allen, a doctoral fellow in the Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Emory University, in Atlanta, raised the money through crowdfunding.

On The Daily Dot she wrote: ‘I’ve been called every anti-woman, anti-gay, and anti-transgender slur in the dictionary.

‘I’ve read three thousand word e-mails from anonymous readers who just want to let me know that I’m a disgrace to my community.

‘So if you had told me last year that I would one day be tearfully thanking the internet for supporting my gender transition, I would have laughed in your face.’

Ms Allen, who was born a man, wanted to have surgery to remove her penis and replace it with a vagina.

She discovered that the operation would cost about $20,000.

Her health insurance would cover part of the cost but she would need to pay the remaining $8,000.

Unable to afford this herself, she and her wife, Corey Burke, created an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign to pay for the gender reassignment surgery.

She explained that she saw having a penis as ‘a source of suffocating shame and self-loathing’ meaning she knew she had to have the surgery.

On her IndieGoGo page she added that she has been taking female hormones since November 2012 and that she has 'spent [her] entire life trying to correct the circumstances of [her] birth.

She wrote 
that she was born into a devout Mormon family and that when she left the
 Mormon church she was told by her father that her decision would have 
'eternal consequences'.

She took this to mean that he thought she would go to hell.

She went on to explain that she did not believe she would raise all of the money through crowdfunding but that she hoped it might make a dent in the total.

However, she couldn’t believe her eyes when she found that every time she refreshed the page the amount raised had increased by $500.

She says by the end of the first day, she had received almost $5,000 in donations and that she reached the target the next day.

She added it took her a little while to realise that her life was about to change forever thanks to the generosity of strangers.

Then, on April 23 this year she underwent surgery, explaining surgery isn't as complex as one might think - it simply involves ‘rearranging’ the tissue that's already there.

She explained that during the operation, the surgeon used the existing tissue to create the vagina as well as a clitoris.

Upon waking from surgery, the first thing she did was Tweet: ‘I have a vagina’, as she felt she should let the people who paid for it know.

And that after the operation, she felt a profound sense of calm wash over her and unlike anything else she had experience - for the first time in her life, she felt beautiful and loved her whole body.

She will now have to use a sex toy to maintain the shape of her new vagina until it has healed.

But, she concludes, the internet has now changed her life for the better.
