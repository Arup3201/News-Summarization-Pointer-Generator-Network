A father who killed his infant son more than a decade ago was found guilty on Tuesday of also murdering his 2-month-old daughter, whose decomposing remains were found in a trash bag at an Arkansas storage unit.

Jason Hann, 38, was convicted of first-degree murder and one count of assault on a child resulting in death, according to the Riverside County district attorney's office.

The Vermont man was living in Desert Hot Springs east of Los Angeles in 2001 when he became angry that his daughter, Montana, was crying. He struck her in the head and killed her, prosecutors said.

Hann and the girl's mother stuffed the body into a ‘blue Tupperware-type plastic container’ and moved away, keeping it in trailers and motorhomes for nine months as they moved from state to state living a ‘transient, gypsy-style life’ doing odd jobs, authorities said.

The couple eventually arrived in Arkansas and left the body in a trailer at a storage facility, authorities said. They intended to return, but they missed some rental payments and their property was sold, authorities said.

In February 2002, a man who bought the trailer found the girl's decomposed body wrapped in plastic bags, authorities said.

Hann and the girl's mother, Krissy Lynn Werntz of Indiana, were arrested two months later at a motel in Maine.

With them was a one-month old son, named Jason, who was found to have numerous broken ribs, bleeding under his skull and other internal injuries, according to the prosecution.

The state placed this child with foster parents, who eventually adopted him.

Witness Jennifer Bloom, an employee of Maine's Department of Human Services, testified she and a colleague were sent to check on the new baby's welfare, and Hann admitted to being involved with the deaths of his two previous children.

‘He said he was responsible for both deaths. He didn't provide a lot of detail. He said, “I fell and blacked out with the baby,”’ Bloom said.

She added Hann said he felt guilty about the death of his two previous children, and felt he had to keep moving to evade police.

The body of the couple's first child, who also was named Jason, was found similarly wrapped in trash bags inside a rubber container, in a storage locker in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. He was 6 weeks old when he died in 1999.

Authorities said Hann had trekked around with the boy's body for 18 months.

Hann was serving a 27- to 30-year prison sentence for that death when he was extradited to California in 2009 to be tried for Montana's death, and it took four years for the death-penalty case to make its way through the system and into opening arguments.

He pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in that case, and California jurors found the special allegation that he had previously committed murder.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The other option would be life without possibility of parole.

Werntz, 34, is awaiting trial on one count of murder. She was originally scheduled to be tried at the same time as Hann, but family medical problems have postponed her trial.
