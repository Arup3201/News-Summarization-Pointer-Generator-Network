For years this favela in Brazil was controlled by the brutal Third Command drugs gang who ran extortion rackets, imposed curfews, and kept the terrified population in line with violence.

Almost a quarter of the homes in the in Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia neighbourhood, built with whatever materials the poor residents could get their hands on,  still have no running water or electricity.

But for one night only 11 girls from this hillside shanty town in Rio de Janiero were able to forget the misery of their daily lives and become princesses at their very own debutante ball.

Eleven girls from one of Brazil's poorest favelas were treated to a debutante ball organised by local police and a team of volunteers

The girls were given makeovers and dressed up in gowns that were loaned to them from nearby shops to provide a fairytale evening

A team of volunteers was brought in to give the girls a full makeover, while ball gowns were loaned from local shops to make their night of magic complete.

The ball was held at an upmarket tennis club which lent its services for the occasion, while the girls were accompanied by officers from the local Police Protection Units.

Like most of Brazil's poorest neighbourhoods, Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia are bordered by some of the most expensive in the world.

Just a few streets from where these girls live, families will regularly spend up to $50,000 to give their daughters the perfect ball to mark their  15th birthday.

The girls often wear three dresses: one to greet guests in, one to waltz in, and another less restricting one to dance the night away in.

The debutante ball, which takes place on a girl's 15th birthday, has a strong tradition in Brazil, with many spending thousands on the event

This favela used to be run by a brutal drug cartel, with the police occasionally raiding their stongholds before retreating. Now a local force lives and works there 24/7, and helps to organise events such as this one

It is tradition for each party to have a theme, and some parents will hire event coordinators and designers to try and outshine the others.

In the favelas, the average family survives on just $30 a week, putting even a modest celebration well beyond their reach. 

The favela debutante ball was part of new efforts to regain control of the slums around Rio from drug gangs by building trust in the local police forces.

The Protection Units represent a new tactic in Brazil's fight against organised crime.

Previously, heavily armed officers would raid the city's poorest districts, battle with drug gangs, arrest as many of them as possible, then leave.

The ball is run by the Police Protection Unit who live and work in the favela 24 hours a day in order to reclaim the streets from the Third Command drug gang who used to operate there

Hundreds of homes in the Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia favelas are without power or running water, but for one night these girls were allowed to forget their daily lives and celebrate

Police forces help to put on the balls in order to rebuild trust in communities whose only contact with officers up until that point was during armed raids on violent drug gangs in their neighbourhoods

But for residents caught in the cross fire this bread mistrust, even hatred of the authorities, and meant they were unwilling to work with officers.

By contrast the protection units live and work in the favelas full time, replacing the drug gangs as everyday enforcers of law on the streets.

While it has not eliminated the problem of gangs completely, it means they cannot operate in the open, and drives down violence which had become an everyday occurrence here.

It also allows girls like these to enjoy one night away from all of their troubles and take part in the tradition of the debutante ball.

Dresses were loaned out to the girls from local shops, while volunteers helped to do their makeup and hair

While many Brazilian families will spend up to $50,000 on their daughter's 15th birthday ball, families in the slums live on $30 a week, putting even a modest party beyond their reach
