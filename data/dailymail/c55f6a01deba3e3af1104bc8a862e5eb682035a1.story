Police were accused of exaggerating falls in crime last night as official figures showed dramatic drops in burglary, car crime and vandalism.

The national crime survey showed overall crime fell by more than 8 per cent last year to a record low.

Police recorded crime figures showed a similar fall, of 7 per cent.

Strange: The line on this Government graph show the rate of crime according to the British Crime Survey, and the bar chart shows crimes recorded by police, which is much lower

But the Office for National Statistics said police figures may have exaggerated the fall in crime in recent years.

Officials said police were under ‘informal pressure’ to meet crime reduction targets and so may have downgraded some crimes so they were not reported. This could lead to a burglary being reported as criminal damage or low-level vandalism as anti-social behaviour, they said.

Police recorded 400,000 fewer offences over five years than those reported in Crime Survey for England and Wales, a survey of more than 40,000 households seen as more accurate because it is not linked to police figures.

Labour called for an inquiry into whether fewer crimes were being recorded as a result of cuts in police funding.

But the Association of Chief Police Officers insisted there were other reasons to explain the discrepancy.

Douglas Paxton, Deputy Chief Constable of Staffordshire, said officers may have been ‘over-zealous’ in how they recorded crime when new standards were brought in ten years ago. He added that more crimes were dealt with informally by neighbourhood policing teams.

Questions: Experts have said the police's recording of crimes may be lower than they should be - as low-level crime may be dropping off the system

The CSEW shows that crime has reached its lowest level since records began in 1981, despite sharp cuts to police funding.

In what will come as good news for Home Secretary Theresa May, the national crime survey found there were 8.9million crimes committed in the year to September 2012 – 820,000 fewer than a year earlier.

The Office for National Statistics said it expected crime to fall even further in future as yesterday’s numbers were the start of an ‘emerging downward trend’.

8.9 million incidents of crime, down 8%*

1.8 million incidents of vandalism, down 14%

653,000 incidents of burglary, down 11%

1.1 million vehicle-related thefts, down 11%

468,000 bicycle thefts,up 2%

1.4 million household thefts, up 5%

3.6 million household crimes, down 4%

551,000 thefts from the person, down 7%

1 million thefts of personal property, down  8%

1.9 million incidents of violence, down 12%

1.8 million personal theft, down 6%

*according to the British Crime Survey

It showed that burglary was down by 11 per cent, including an 18 per cent fall in break-ins in which the intruder entered the property. Theft from vehicles was down 11 per cent.

Overall, violent crime was down by 12 per cent – with the number having halved since 1995.

The murder rate fell 10 per cent to 551, its lowest since 1978.

Statisticians said the fall in house and car break-ins was linked to improvements in home security and car locking and alarm systems.

But so-called pickpocket thefts rose 6 per cent, due to thieves targeting expensive iPods and iPhones to sell on overseas.

Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne said: ‘Police reform is working. We have swept away central targets, reduced bureaucracy and these figures show forces are rising to the challenge of doing more with less.’

Forces are no longer judged on a Labour target for bringing offenders to justice which critics said encouraged the police to solve easy crimes to improve their clear-up rate.

John Flatley, of the ONS, said: ‘[With] some lower level crimes there is a judgment call to be made as to whether the incident attended to by the officer is actually a crime in law or a low level incident that would not get into the crime figures.

‘It’s possible in an era of targets to cut crime and pressure on officers to see a reduction in crime that their judgment will sway more to including that in the lower level category.’

There were 8.9m crimes in 12 months to September - the lowest ever according to the official British Crime Survey

@highlight

Nearly all crime is down apart from street theft, as criminals are targeting smartphones, iPods, iPads and bikes

@highlight

But separate crime figures recorded by police show an even bigger drop, which experts say shows that have 'overstated' improvement

Targets 'may have swayed officers into downgrading marginal incidents', ONS says
