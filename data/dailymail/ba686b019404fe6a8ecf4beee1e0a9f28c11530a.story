David Cameron today admits he is 'paid handsomely' as Prime Minister amid a row over whether he publish his tax returns before the election. 

The Prime Minister insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of releasing details of his earnings so voters can see if politicians paid the right tax.

But Chancellor George Osborne, who first floated the idea in the Cabinet, admitted at the weekend that there are 'no plans' for it to go ahead.

Mr Cameron and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the 2012 Budget to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.

Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off. 

Now, with four months until polling day, the plan has been thrown into doubt.

Mr Osborne told theSunday Times: 'There are genuine issues around taxpayer confidentiality and how it would work in practice.

'You see it as a feature of some American campaigns but I think there would be quite a lot of practical difficulties. There are no plans at this point. The income I receive is publicly declared.'

Speaking at an event in Ipswich today, Mr Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year said: 'On the issue of my tax returns, nothing has changed. I am very relaxed about publishing these things.

'There's no secret about my status. I am paid very handsomely as your Prime Minister and that's my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street and I rent that out and I get income from that.

'I don't have other sources of income. There will be no surprises in terms of my tax affairs.

'But I am very relaxed as I've always said - nothing has changed about that issue.' 

He declares income from renting out his former family home in Notting Hill where he lived with wife Samantha and their children before moving into Downing Street.

The register of MPs' interests does not include the amount he receives, but as a family it is almost certain to be more than £7,500, pushing Mr Cameron into the threshold for paying the top rate of tax.

Mr Osborne earns £134,565 as Chancellor and also declares shares in his family's wallpaper firm, Osborne And Little Ltd, which is said to be worth £4million.

When the idea of publishing tax returns was first floated, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he would be happy to do so 'if that's the way things are going', and Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, said he had 'no objection in principle'.

In April 2013 government ministers in France began releasing details of their financial records in the wake of a tax fraud scandal involving a close ally of President Francois Hollande.

Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'Politicians must keep their word if they are to be trusted, so having said they would publish their returns, those in the highest offices should do just that.'

Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'My view is that they should stick to what they said they would do.'
