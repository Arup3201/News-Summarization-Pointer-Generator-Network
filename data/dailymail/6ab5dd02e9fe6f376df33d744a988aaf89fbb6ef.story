It is likely to be the last time that the generation who served in the Second World War is able to gather in numbers.

And following mounting alarm that the 70th anniversary of VE Day risked being overlooked, David Cameron is to announce plans for three days of national commemoration.

Party leaders, senior Royals, veterans and organisations whose members played a part in the war effort will gather on May 8 at the Cenotaph in London.

Communities will be encouraged to put on street parties and other events over the two following days, culminating in a national service at Westminster Abbey and a parade.

Earlier this month, the Daily Mail highlighted concerns that the anniversary of the greatest victory in the country’s history risked being overshadowed by the general election, which takes place the day before. Dame Vera Lynn, 97, was among those who called on the Government to do more.

May 8 will mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day, the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany and the destruction of Hitler’s Third Reich.

The Prime Minister has appointed former Foreign Secretary, William Hague, now leader of the Commons, to oversee plans for the anniversary.

The commemorations will recognise all aspects of the war effort, including the home front.

Mr Cameron told the Mail: ‘VE Day is one of the most pivotal moments in our nation’s proud history.

‘After years of all-out war and the untold sacrifice of millions at both home and abroad this day marked the moment when the threat of Nazi brutality was finally lifted.

‘As a nation, it is vital that we remember the 70th anniversary of this historic day and I am delighted to announce that William Hague will play a key role in coordinating the final stages of those plans.’

The celebrations will start 24 hours after the general election, while some of the results are still being declared. The May 7 poll is widely expected to be close and could result in no clear winner.

For the 50th anniversary of VE Day in 1995 there were celebrations across the country, as people came together to thank the wartime generation. Hundreds of thousands of people assembled in London’s Hyde Park for concerts and ceremonies.

Great-grandmother Margaret Dickson, 96, of Darlington, who served as an ambulance driver in Corby, Northamptonshire, welcomed the announcement of three days of commemorations this year.

‘It’s wonderful news. I had tears in my eyes when I read how little had been planned so I am delighted that something will be done,’ she said.

‘We had been through hell and VE Day was such a wonderful moment. I still remember the street parties and all the baking. It’s so important for today’s young people to know about it.’

Dougie Radcliffe, secretary of the Bomber Command Association, said: ‘We’re still looking after 3,000 members in their 90s and if there is to be a commemoration on this scale, we will love to take part.’

Neil Coppendale of Shoreham, West Sussex, who organised a petition calling for the Government to recognise both VE Day and VJ Day, in August, said May 8 commemorations are important for two reasons. ‘The first is to raise awareness and to educate the next generation,’ he said. ‘The second is an opportunity to say thank you to those involved.

‘They are all in their 90s and won’t be around forever. I think it would be criminal if this country did not mark the occasion.’

Lord Astor of Hever, a Government spokesman on defence, said: ‘Our plans hope to mark the achievements not only of our Armed Forces personnel during the Second World War but also those who were fighting another battle on the home front.’

The veterans of the ‘Forgotten Army’ and the bitter campaign against Japan will not be overlooked. Plans are also under way to mark the final cessation of hostilities and the 70th anniversary of VJ Day on August 15.

The Government spent £50 million on commemorating the 100th anniversary of the First World War.
