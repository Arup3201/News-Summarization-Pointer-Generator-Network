Wedged into metal pipes at subway stations, they go unnoticed by millions of New Yorkers daily.

But these hidden surveillance cameras are actually tracking the movements of commuters.

The cameras, disguised in pipes near Metrocard machines, turnstiles and token booths, are part of a covert Metropolitan Transportation Authority surveillance network that monitors travelers' activity.

They are separate from the dome-shaped surveillance devices that are clearly visible at stations across the city - but can reportedly be monitored real-time 'if deemed necessary' by officials.

At Herald Square subway station at 34th Street alone, at least six cameras are hidden inside what appear to be electrical conduits to observe commuters, according to the New York Post.

The MTA describes the devices as 'antiquated', claiming they date back to as far as the 1990s. However, some of the cameras appear to be housed in new metal pipes, the newspaper noted.

'They are covert cameras for high-priority areas or high crime. They record, but can be monitored real-time if it’s deemed necessary,' one source explained.

And the cameras - positioned in casings that will capture commuters' heads and shoulders - are so well hidden that even agency employees and transit advocates were not aware of their existence.

William Henderson, executive director of the MTA’s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, said: 'I think I may have first heard they were planning to put cameras in less obvious places last year. But I never noticed these.' Meanwhile, experts have deemed the devices 'fascinating'.

'They look like a part of the industrial environment of the MTA,' Robert McCrie, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice’s Department of Security, Fire and Emergency Management, said.

'They are positioned in ways to get people’s heads and shoulders.'

However, others have condemned the hidden cameras, citing serious privacy concerns.

Norman Siegel, a civil-rights lawyer, said the agency should be more forthright about the cameras, which he said 'sweep up' information on commuters in a 'vacuum-cleaner' manner.

Members of the public have also spoken of their uneasiness at the cameras' covert presence. 

The MTA has refused to disclose which other stations may have the hidden cameras, nor where the camera feed is transmitted.

This is for security reasons, the agency told the newspaper.

In addition to the hidden surveillance cameras, the MTA reportedly uses other - equally covert - 'enhanced equipment', such as cameras of higher quality, that 'serve in various capacities'.

In fact, it prefers to use the latter to monitor commuters' activity, spokesman Kevin Ortiz said.

In total, there are said to be more than 4,500 cameras throughout the subway system. Many of these cameras have aided police in their efforts to track down suspects and investigate crimes. 

Last year, it emerged that the MTA is planning to install surveillance cameras in subway cars between 2015 and 2019. The cameras will be fixed to 940 new subway cars to catch criminals.

The agency is also said to be considering the installment of cameras in 300  cars that were purchased last year for the C and J lines. A pilot project was tested in 2010.

The latest surveillance revelations come just a week after New Yorkers braved sub-zero temperatures and windy conditions to go bare-legged for the annual 'No Pants Subway Ride'.

Donning hats, scarves and thick coats on their top halves, participants boarded trains at stations across the city last Sunday - surrounded by bemused travellers.

Scantily-clad riders also took part in places including London, Milan, Bucharest, Berlin and Mexico City - all joined in as part of the 'celebration of silliness'. 

The event started off as a prank by comedy group Improv Everywhere in 2002, bemusing a few embarrassed commuters,. However, it has since grown into a global phenomenon.
