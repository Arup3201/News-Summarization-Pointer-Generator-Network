Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire led a growing mutiny against BBC chiefs yesterday as ‘civil war’ broke out over the Jimmy Savile crisis.

She publicly rounded on senior figures after Newsnight editor Peter Rippon was ‘hung out to dry’ by the director-general, George Entwistle.

BBC executives at the heart of the scandal have now enlisted personal lawyers as the blame game turns increasingly vicious.

allegations of abuse, in 2006. Ms Boaden allegedly had 'impossibly high demands' for the investigation

During his grilling by MPs on Tuesday,
 Mr Entwistle barely missed a chance to twist the knife over Mr Rippon’s
 disastrous handling of Newsnight’s Savile investigation.

But his 
strategy to heap all the blame on Mr Rippon sparked a backlash at the 
corporation – and calls for BBC News boss Helen Boaden to be quizzed 
about claims she was involved in the debacle too.

Both she and her deputy, Stephen 
Mitchell, and Mr Rippon have all employed individual personal lawyers to
 advise them, it is understood.

One source said: ‘It feels like civil 
war. The relationship between management and the news division is at an 
all-time low.

'No one [linked to the scandal] in news wants to say 
anything without a lawyer present. There is zero trust at how management
 will handle all this. It is a mess.’

The
 BBC announced Mr Rippon had 'stepped aside' on Monday as it corrected 
inaccuracies in his October 2 blog

There is also a split within news with
 some journalists now accusing the Panorama team of having looked into 
Savile a year before the planned Newsnight investigation. The BBC said 
Panorama strenuously denied this.

Yesterday Miss Derbyshire told her 
32,000 followers on Twitter: ‘If BBC journos/Eds make a poor editorial 
call, (& most of us hve at some point), will they be treated by 
mgemnt like Peter Rippon has been?’

Former Radio 4 Today programme editor 
Rod Liddle said Mr Entwistle had ‘dobbed Peter Rippon in’. He told 
Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman: ‘Entwistle looked as though he was hanging
 the editor out to dry, as members of your staff are hanging the editor 
out to dry,’ and added: ‘I find it very, very difficult to accept there 
was no pressure on Rippon.’

Mr Rippon was ordered by the 
director-general to ‘step aside’ from his role this week after he wrote 
an error-strewn blog on why he canned Newsnight’s investigation into 
Savile.

He has come under fire for allegedly 
‘killing’ the Savile expose by declaring the victims were ‘not too 
young’ and saying ‘they weren’t the worst kind of sexual offences’. 
Embattled Mr Rippon has repeatedly insisted he alone took the decision 
to scrap the Newsnight film without anyone more senior ‘leaning’ on him 
to do so.

Yesterday it emerged his boss Helen 
Boaden, director of BBC News, could face questioning from the same 
committee of MPs that grilled Mr Entwistle.

It was claimed she allegedly set an 
‘impossibly high barrier’ before Newsnight’s plans to expose Savile by 
insisting journalists act as though he was still alive and be able to 
sue the BBC for libel.

Her intervention last year is said to have influenced Mr Rippon’s decision to scrap the report.

Miss Boaden, 56, has not publicly 
uttered a word about her role since the scandal engulfed the corporation
 nearly four weeks ago. In 2006, she was photographed in high spirits 
with Savile at an awards lunch, and she and her husband own a holiday 
home in Scarborough, one of Savile’s favourite haunts.

The £340,000-a-year news chief told Mr
 Rippon that ‘just because Jimmy Savile was dead, it didn’t mean there 
could be any skimping in journalistic standards’, Mr Entwistle told MPs.

Asked whether Mr Rippon might have 
interpreted that as pressure from above to drop the investigation, Mr 
Entwistle said it had not been ‘an inappropriate point to make’.

But a Newsnight source told The Times 
that Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean, the journalists leading the 
programme’s investigation, believed Miss Boaden’s intervention had 
effectively blocked their report, adding: ‘Boaden placed an impossibly 
high barrier to the story.’

Mr Mitchell, Miss Boaden’s deputy, is 
also under the spotlight after it was confirmed he had read the 
Newsnight editor’s ‘inaccurate’ blog before publication.

BBC sources confirmed the corporation would not be paying the bills for executives personal lawyers.
