Putting the kitchen knives away and out of reach of our 11-year-old son for fear he would deliberately hurt himself has been, without doubt, our lowest point as parents.

But we had no choice. Two months after starting ‘big school’ last year our lovely boy, Jack, our previously care-free fourth child, had made an attempt to cut his arm with a large chopping knife.

Jack had skipped off to secondary school full of excitement.  

When your child breaks a leg it’s a blue light into A&E. But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response was to tell our child to pull himself together (file picture)

But within weeks he had descended into a mental health freefall — consumed with worry about being late to school and struggling with his homework, he became severely withdrawn and paranoid. 

He wasn’t sleeping, and his anxiety was making him physically unwell. My husband and I were not remotely prepared for it.

Three months after he tried to cut himself — and by now nearly halfway through his school year — Jack was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), which means you feel anxious about almost everything. 

Sufferers also start catastrophising, imagining the worst possible outcome for everything that is bothering them. 

Indeed for Jack, every problem would morph into something far bigger.

Our son is now well on his way to a complete recovery, thanks to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 

But accessing the specialist help he needed was unbelievably difficult, and if I hadn’t kept battling his corner, there is no doubt in my mind that by now he would be in hospital.

When your child breaks a leg it’s a blue light into A&E. When their asthma gets worse, the doctor will write you a new inhaler prescription. 

But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response — at least in our case — was to tell our child to pull himself together.

So a crushing report published last month by the Commons Health Select Committee made painfully familiar reading. 

It is estimated that one in ten children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder — including GAD —which equates to three children per class.

That’s 290,000 children in Britain. The report concluded there were ‘serious and deeply ingrained problems’ with mental health services for these young people.

You’re telling me.

At first, I approached the school, two weeks into Jack’s first term. 

Doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the report from the Commons Health Select Committee

I explained he seemed disproportionately stressed. But responses from staff were feeble: ‘Don’t worry, it’s Year Seven, they all feel a bit like this’ and ‘We have children here with real problems, just give him time, he’ll settle’.

Although Jack was able to keep it together at school, every day he would come home crying and all the problems would tumble out. 

‘I don’t like that school, I don’t like my tutor, I’ve no one to sit with at break,’ the list was endless.

As the weeks went by, he started having trouble sleeping. He would regularly still be awake into the early hours, crying and screaming that he hated life. He began to sleepwalk and lost weight.

It was a frightening time for all of us. I felt wretched. Every waking minute of every day my thoughts were centred on Jack. 

After two months, I took him to see the GP. I couldn’t get an appointment with my usual doctor, so we saw another GP in the practice.

She didn’t know our family at all, and had no way of gauging if this behaviour was usual for us.

Indeed, doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the new report.

In a poignant comment, GP Jane Roberts, who is the Royal College of General Practitioners’ clinical champion for youth mental health issues, told the Commons Health Select Committee: ‘In a ten-minute consultation it can feel overwhelming to open a Pandora’s box and begin to look at what is troubling a young person . . . especially if the options for referral are limited and difficult to access.’

The report’s authors want GPs to receive better training in young people’s mental health, saying everyone has a right to see a professional with sufficient knowledge.

Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it has been campaigning to include mandatory placements in mental health care in GP training.

The GP we saw initially advised us to give Jack a few more weeks to see if school became more familiar. 

But a week later Jack came home with his older brother, who announced he couldn’t cope any more with his sibling’s increasingly erratic behaviour to and from school. 

He said Jack was constantly checking his bag, checking the time and, on occasions, would try to go back to school at the end of the day to check his homework with the teachers.

It was as he was telling me this that Jack took a large kitchen knife to his arm. 

It was a half-hearted attempt and thankfully he didn’t actually pierce the skin.

My ‘lioness protecting her cubs’ instinct kicked in. 

Through his tears — and mine — I calmly told him to put down the knife and hugged him, saying whatever I could think of to comfort him.

You will do anything to protect your child, but I knew I was woefully out of my depth. 

As much as I was saying we would help him, I knew ‘the system’ was failing us.

That same day, I went to the GP surgery and asked for an appointment then and there. 

But it was the end of surgery hours and it was only when I quietly refused to leave they agreed to see us.

We saw yet another GP, who leaned forward and told Jack all about the patients she had seen that day, who were perhaps more in need of help than him.

I told her calmly that our son had dallied with knives and told his brother he wanted to die. 

The GP — barely out of med-school — stayed completely expressionless, not so much as a raised eyebrow.

I asked for a referral to child and adolescent mental health services and at first she suggested we wait and see and come back in the New Year — some four weeks later — if need be.

With tears of frustration now rolling down my cheeks, I again indicated my willingness to camp in the surgery until the referral letter was written. 

She begrudgingly agreed, though our son still wasn’t seen — even as an emergency referral — until January.

The psychiatrist we saw was sympathetic but made a shocking suggestion. If we could afford it we should pay privately for CBT — Jack could wait to get it on the NHS, but that could take as long as three months. She could see he needed help urgently, but said there was nothing she could do.

Chris Leaman, policy manager at the charity YoungMinds, is not surprised by our story.

He says last year 77 per cent of clinical commissioning groups, (the bodies responsible in NHS England for commissioning, planning, agreeing and monitoring health services) had their budgets cut or frozen for such services.

In emergency cases, children can end up in police cells as there are no NHS beds available.

We are lucky. We have private medical insurance. But still it was a battle — at every stage I had to keep chasing, and it wasn’t until March we had our first appointment with the psychologist who would finally help our son.

Jack found it hard — CBT works on changing your thought processes, which is not easy — but he is now well on the road to recovery. 

He found it difficult returning to school this September but his psychologist helped him with strategies so he could cope.

We’ve been warned by Jack’s therapist that he may always be someone who doesn’t react well to big change. But how wrong it is that the help he badly needed was not there for him.

Please, health provider decision makers, wake up and make child and adolescent mental health issues a bigger priority. 

Just last week it was revealed seven mental health patients have killed themselves since 2012 while waiting for a bed on a specialist ward.

What more will it take before mental healthcare is taken seriously? It has to be, for all our sakes — but most of all for those young people who need it.
