Tim Sherwood stared straight ahead, unmoved for what seemed an eternity as Victor Moses rolled in Stoke’s stoppage-time penalty to suck the hope out of his debut as Aston Villa manager.

‘Devastated,’ he explained later, never one to under-sell a description. His face on the touchline as his first match ended in defeat illustrated as much.

Just when it seemed Villa would claim a point, underwhelming in the circumstances but important in the grand scheme, they left with none.

Ron Vlaar erred to allow a marauding Moses possession inside the Villa box, then tried to make amends with a diving tackle that only resulted referee Roger East pointing to the spot and producing a red card.

In the third minute of added time, Moses sent Brad Guzan the wrong way and the final whistle was swiftly followed by the boos that have frequently echoed around this stadium.

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. It is 11 Premier League games without victory for Villa.

As bouncy as Sherwood had been in the build-up to this game, his demeanour in the aftermath showed the opposite extreme. ‘No-one feels as down as I am,’ he said. ‘No-one.’

He added: ‘It is not all rosy in the garden obviously here, nobody said it was going to be easy. It was a cruel way to lose the game but in the end I thought neither team deserved to win.’

That summation is probably correct, even though Stoke once again illustrated their threat away from the Britannia. This was a fifth win on the road this season, the club’s best total in Premier League history, and all the more impressive given Villa had taken the lead. 

Villa's team-sheet strangely included Kevin Richardson (No 18), a former Villa player who appeared for the club over twenty years ago

‘I’m delighted,’ said Mark Hughes. ‘A lot of people were saying we would get beaten today because we wouldn’t be able to deal with the reaction to Tim’s arrival. We stood up to that and didn’t allow Villa to get any real momentum.’

Sherwood must pick himself and his players up quickly, with this loss sending Villa down to 19th below Burnley.

‘We have to put this behind us and not dwell,’ Sherwood said. ‘I can be devastated now but I won’t be devastated on Monday. Games come thick and fast.’ There are just 12 left for Sherwood to avert the disaster of a drop to the Championship.

It had begun brightly, even after an early struggle for lift-off amid a freak hailstone blitz. Scott Sinclair provided the first goal of the Sherwood era, his header worthy of the No 9 on his back. In the 20th minute Carles Gil hit a corner that drifted all the way to Fabian Delph on the left flank, with Sinclair falling to the floor in a tangle with Phil Bardsley.

He got to his feet quickly and arrived onto Delph’s cross to glance the ball in off the far post. He celebrated arms wide, his first Premier League strike since August 2012. It was also the first Villa goal in an opening period since December 20.

But Stoke found a foothold and began to push back, grabbing an equaliser on the stroke of half-time. Stephen Ireland took a throw to Jonathan Walters, who held off substitute Aly Cissokho and played the ball back. Ireland whipped over a cross and Mame Biram Diouf found space between Vlaar and Alan Hutton to nod in.

The second half was a low-key affair, punctuated by frequent injuries. Referee East was among those hurt, prompting much mirth. Jon Walters held up an imaginary substitute board. ‘You’re not fit to referee,’ was sung by the Holte End.

Sherwood used the delay to hold a team talk, but there was little improvement from his team. Ciaran Clark’s header drew a finger-tip save from Begovic in the final minute, but it was Stoke who struck instead.

If he did not know before, Sherwood must now realise the scale of his task.
