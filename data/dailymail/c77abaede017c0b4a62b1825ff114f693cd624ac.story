He has shown no desire to slow down since leaving Downing Street, going on to build a business empire worth millions and even admitting he would like to return to frontline politics.

But Tony Blair cut a very relaxed - and trim - figure today when he was spotted by photographers while holidaying in Spain.

The former Labour premier looked slim as he walked the streets of a village near Marbella with wife Cherie.

And the former first couple of British politics appeared to be star attractions, with one local woman even offering Mr Blair a bow as she shook his hand.

Mr and Mrs Blair were at times surrounded by surprised locals as they strolled through the village wearing sunglasses.

And they responded to their warm welcome with cheery smiles, clearly enjoying the sunshine.

Mr Blair, who famously converted to Catholicism after stepping down as Prime Minister, wore a wide grin when he visited a church in San Pedro de Alcantara, six miles west of Marbella.

It is unclear who the Blairs have been staying with during their summer holiday.

Previous breaks for the couple have included a trip to Italy in 2004, when they were guests of former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi.

The Blairs have also enjoyed stays at Sir Cliff Richard's home in Barbados and a mansion in Miami owned by late Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb.

At home, however, Mr Blair has hinted that he is in no mood to retire.

He admitted in June that he craved a return to frontline political action.

Mr Blair, who left Downing Street in 2007 after 10 years in power, revealed that he would have considered the posts of president of the EU or the World Bank had they been offered to him.

And he suggested that the experience gained from his business and advisory roles since leaving Parliament, which are thought to have netted him about Â£20million last year, made him well suited to mount a comeback.

'I feel I've got something to say,' he said at the time. 'If people want to listen, that's great, and if they don't, that's their choice...

'I would want to emphasise how fast the world around us is changing and how incredibly dangerous it is for us to think we can stand still.'
