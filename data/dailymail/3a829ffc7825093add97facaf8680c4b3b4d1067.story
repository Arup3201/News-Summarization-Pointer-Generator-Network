They might have hung up their boots a few years ago but some of Liverpool's most famous players showed that class is permanent during a friendly on Monday.

The likes of Robbie Fowler, Jerzy Dudek and Ian Rush lined up alongside each other to form a Liverpool Masters team to face Thailand Legends in Bangkok.

And the Reds came out on top in the showpiece at Rajamangala Stadium, winning the game 4-3 courtesy of a  goal from Steve McManaman.

Former England striker Emile Heskey, Patrick Berger, Phil Babb, Jan Kromkamp and Vladimir Smicer also pulled on a red kit once again to represent their former club.

Dudek was pictured being mobbed by local fans after the final whistle, while some of the starting XI posed for a group picture on the pitch with members of the Thailand Legends squad. 

The result followed Liverpool Masters' 3-1 win against a team of ex-Singapore internationals on Saturday, when goals from Heskey and Jari Litmanen helped them to victory.
