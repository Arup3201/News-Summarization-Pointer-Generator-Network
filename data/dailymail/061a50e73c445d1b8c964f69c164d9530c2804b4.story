A wanted Mafia cop killer has been captured by detectives as he sunned himself on a beach.

Massimiliano Sestito, 42, was held along with an accomplice after a six week undercover investigation following a tip off.

Sestito had been released on parole but failed to return to prison after being convicted of the shooting of police officer Renato Lio, who was gunned down by the mobster when he failed to stop at a police roadblock.

Massimiliano Sestito, a Mafia cop killer was arrested in his trunks as he sunbathed on a beach in southern Italy

Holidaymakers looked on stunned as Sestito, dressed only in a pair of swimming trunks, was surrounded by armed police who broke cover on the beach at Centola near Palinuro in southern Italy.

Initially he tried to claim police had the wrong man and showed them a false identity card but the ruse failed and he was arrested and taken to a nearby police station, along another man he was with.

Last month he was released on parole from a prison near Rome but failed to report into police as ordered and instead went on the run

Police released a picture of him sitting on a towel in his trunks and in handcuffs as an officer stood by.

He was originally sentenced to life but this was reduced to 30 years for the 1991 cop killing and is still said to be a key figure in the Calabrian Mafia known as the 'ndrangheta and he is suspected of several other Mafia related crimes such as extortion, racketeering, drug trafficking and he was also the prime suspect in another murder and a further attempted murder.

Last month he was released on parole from a prison near Rome but failed to report into police as ordered and instead went on the run - and thought he would be safe soaking up the rays on the beach.

One holidaymaker said: 'It was like a scene from a film - one minute everyone was enjoying the suns and the sea, the next there were armed police everywhere screaming at these two guys in their trunks to get down.

'They tried to tell the police they had the wrong people but it didn't work - they put handcuffs on them and took them away. It's not something you see everyday at the beach.'

When officers searched the home of the second man arrested, Antonio Gallo, they arrested his mother Anna and also seized original documents in Sestito's name and they were charged with assisting hm in avoiding capture.

A police spokesman in Rome said: 'We received information that Sesito was hiding out in the south of Italy and passed it to colleagues based there.

'A surveillance operation was launched and Sestito was tracked down to the beach where he was arrested. He obviously thought he was safe but he was very wrong. He was very surprised to see us and after initially trying to climb he was someone else he was arrested.

'He has been convicted of murdering a police officer in 1991 and other mafia related crimes and even though he has been in prison the feeling is he has still exerted influence in organised crime circles. He is suspected of ordering a murder earlier this year of a rival in Rome and is also the prime suspect in another attempted murder.'

Rome police chief Fulvio della Rocca said: 'This was an excellent operation and I congratulate all those officers involved. They were all highly professional - the man arrested is a key figure within the 'ndrangheta who are spreading their influence across Rome.'

It is not the first time that a wanted mobster has been arrested on a beach - last year crime boss Roberto Mattalone was also captured at the seaside near the southern port city of Reggio Calabria after two years on the run, as he read a book on police anti mafia operations.
