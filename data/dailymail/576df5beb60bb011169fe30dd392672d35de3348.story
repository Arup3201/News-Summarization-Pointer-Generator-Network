It may not look that spectacular, but fans of The Only Way is Essex are flocking from around the world to experience the Brentwood set of the hit TV series.

Visitors are paying £22 each to see where the show is filmed - and £18 for children under 15 - more than the cost of a ride on the London Eye, a tour of the Tower of London, and not much cheaper than a studio tour of Harry Potter.

Remarkably, tourists are travelling to Essex from as far afield as Australia in the hope of meeting stars of the ITV2 show, which is now coming into its seventh series.

And the bus tours allowing viewers to see where the Bafta award-winning series is filmed have proved a huge hit with diehard fans of the show.

Brit Movie Tours has enjoyed sell-out trips since they introduced dedicated tours of the TOWIE heartland last summer.

TOWIE tour guide, Louise Stanton, 30, from Southend, Essex, puts the success of the tour down to accessibility of the show's stars.

She said: 'The cast are always in their shops and happy to pose up with fans which is great for everybody on board.

'They make everyone feel like they are a part of the show.

'Everybody seems to enjoy themselves and we've already had people turn up because their friends told them it was reem.

'The other week we had someone on the tour from Australia - apparently the show is really popular out there.

'We have people from across the country, especially from up north, and the bus is always sold out which shows just how popular the show is.

'The tour is really popular with hen dos or as a Christmas or birthday treat and we seem to attract all ages from young children to grown up TOWIE fans.'

The four-hour tour takes in a host of sights from the show including popular nightspot The Sugar Hut in Brentwood, King William IV pub in Chigwell, where many of the shows rocky romantic relationships blossomed, and a number of the stars' boutiques dotted around the county.

Visitors often bump into stars of the show - who own posh boutiques in Brentwood, Buckhurst Hill and Loughton - along the way.
