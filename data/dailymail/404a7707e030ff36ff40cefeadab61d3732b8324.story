Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho admits he must add more goals to his game as he strives to become one of the best midfielders in Europe.

The Brazilian star has been in outstanding form this season but has scored just five, albeit often spectacular, goals in all competitions as the club have attempted to qualify for the Champions League for the second season in a row.

In total, Coutinho has scored just 13 goals in 92 games since joining Liverpool from Inter in January 2013, and the 22-year-old insists he is determined to improve his record in the coming months.

He told Liverpool's official website: 'I think I still have to improve.

'I have not improved yet. I scored a few goals last month but I need to improve.

'I have this ambition, this objective of improving finishing. In the position I play, I need to score goals to help the team and create plays. Therefore I must improve my goalscoring skills.'
