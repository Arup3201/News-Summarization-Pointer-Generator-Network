James Bond author William Boyd landed himself in a row over product placement after accepting a six-figure sum from Land Rover.

But the author has defended his decision to include a mention of the brand, saying authors have always written for commission, including Charles Dickens.

In his latest novella, his protagonist - Alex Dunbar - sets off for Scotland in a battered, old Land Rover Defender.

The car manufacturer commissioned the writer to pen The Vanishing Game - but he said he was given free reign and only told that it would be good if a Land Rover appeared somewhere in the 17,000-word story. 

Commission: Author William Boyd received a six-figure sum from Land Rover to pen The Vanishing Game

The writer said he agreed to the project for a low six-figure sum because Land Rover had made so few requests.  

He said: 'They said they wanted an adventure and they said, 'Somewhere in this adventure it would be good if a Land Rover appeared.' 

'But it was left entirely to me the extent I concentrated on that or made it fleeing and passing.

'I invented the story, I invented the characters, I invented the locations.' 

He told The Times: 'If I was approached to write a Batman movie I would assume it would have to feature Batman.

'There's really no difference in this case.'

But although fellow writers are on board with the idea of product placement moving from the cinema and television shows to fiction, publishing house Galley Beggar Press tweeted 'Oh jesus god no' in response to the news. 

Ken Bracht, communications manager for Land Rover North America, said Boyd was their preferred author early on.

Boyd received a lot of attention for writing a James Bond novel, called Solo, which was published last year

This was 'given his popularity, reputation for adventure type stories' and the attention he was receiving at the time for his Bond novel, 'Solo,' published in September last year.

The Vanishing Game is available as a free eBook from Amazon and Apple as can be read from an interactive Tumblr page. 

While the literary community is not known for commercial endorsements, there are precedents. 

In 2001, Bulgari commissioned Fay Weldon to write 'The Bulgari Connection' and references to the jewellers were worked into the story.  

Julia Alvarez wrote a poem for Absolut vodka and several authors, including Elmore Leonard and Lisa Scottoline, contributed essays for a 1990s Coca-Cola campaign.
