Inter Milan will propose a loan with view to a permanent £15million deal for Manchester City misfit Stevan Jovetic.

The 25-year-old striker is keen to return to Italy after making just 39 appearances since his £22million move from Fiorentina in 2013. 

City would prefer the money up front and are reluctant to agree to a loan deal for the Montenegro international.

Negotiations took place on Thursday and will continue again over the coming weeks as they try to strike a solution. 

Inter remain keen on Jovetic's Manchester City team-mate Yaya Toure.

Toure recently hinted he could be keen on a move away from the Etihad Stadium as he is open to 'new challenges'.
