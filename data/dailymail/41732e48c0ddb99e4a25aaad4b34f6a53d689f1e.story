A college basketball coach who injured himself celebrating his team's last victory was knocked out of his chair after after seeing his son hit a game winning shot.

Ron Hunter, the coach of Georgia State, toppled off of the stool where he had cheered on the Panthers after his son RJ sent the 14-seed past Baylor into the NCAA tournament's third round.

Hunter's deep three-pointer put the Sun Belt conference champions up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining, and his team held on for their first tournament win.

Baylor, from the Big 12 conference had been favorited in the game by 9, though Georgia State was able to beat the Bears behind the younger Hunter's 16 points.

The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. 

Coach Hunter's assistants helped him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics.

He had been perched on the rolling chair after he tore his Achilles tendon celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern.

The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game.

Georgia State will play either 6-seed Xavier or 11-seed Ole Miss in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West bracket.

Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, who was favored by 14 points.  

The squad is making its first appearance in the NCAA's big dance since 2001.

Team members include former Louisville player Kevin Ware, who broke his leg at the tournament in 2013 in gruesome fashion.
