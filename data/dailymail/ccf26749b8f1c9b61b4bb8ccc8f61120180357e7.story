Want to survive an apocalypse on the cheap?

As 10-storey bomb-proof lairs go, this missile silo-turned-home is a bargain at $295,000.

And with 25 acres of land - and just a door sticking out in the New Mexico desert - you can say goodbye to nosey neighbors. 

Covert: This is the mysterious entrance to a 10-storey, 40-foot-deep home that was once a missile silo

The bunker near Roswell, New Mexico, once housed a missile in the 1960s.

Half a century later, it is fully equipped with bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and living room - plus 25 acres of land and 280 acres of water rights.

Not even a bomb could penetrate this unconventional property.

The real estate agent is hoping would-be buyers will be enticed by the unique style, reminiscent of Bond missions.

And it appears to be working as more than 40 people have called to enquire.

Among the property hunters, calls have also come in from film companies.

'I've had a lot of different kinds of calls,' realtor Jim Moore told Kob News.

'There's a lot of uses for one of these,' said Moore. 

'They can do hydroponic gardening with it, underground storage. If you want to build yourself an underground castle, there it is.'

Reclusive: You won't have to worry about nosey neighbors - or an apocalypse - in this sheltered home

The silo was converted into a home after the missile was removed and a man bought it from the government.

He spent decades transforming the interior until he died last year.

'He started to build a house here,' said Moore. 

'He was going to live his life out underground, and unfortunately, he passed away. 

'This one of the few missile silos for sale in the United States. It's one of the more unusual listings that I've come across.'
