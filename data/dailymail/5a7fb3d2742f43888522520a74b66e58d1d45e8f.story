Archaeologists in Guatemala say they have discovered the tomb of Queen Kalomt'e K'Abel, one of the great warrior queens of the Maya civilisation who was dubbed 'the Holy Snake Lord'.

The tomb, which has lain undisturbed for centuries, was found during excavations of the royal Maya city of El Perú-Waka, in the sweltering Petén jungle region in northern Guatemala.

Among a hoard of glistening jade jewels, the archaeologists found in the seventh-century tomb a small alabaster vase showing the image of the queen's face and inscribed with her name.

considered one of the great warrior queens of the Maya civilisation

'To discover something of this 
importance is very unusual,' lead archaeologist David Freidel told 
Reuters. 'She was the supreme warlord of her kingdom.'

The white alabaster vessel is carved as a conch shell, with the head and arm of an aged woman emerging from the opening.

The depiction of the woman, mature 
with a lined face and a strand of hair in front of her ear, and four 
glyphs carved into the jar, point to the jar as belonging to K’abel, 
researchers say.

The remains were discovered in June but it has taken until now for experts to verify the identity of the queen.

Professor Friedel, an anthropologist and Maya expert working out of the Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, said the find was significant because the newly uncovered tomb is a rare situation in which Maya archaeological and historical records meet.

'The Classic Maya civilization is the only "classical" archaeological field in the New World — in the sense that like archaeology in Ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia or China, there is both an archaeological material record and an historical record based on texts and images,' he added.

'The precise nature of the text and image information on the white stone jar and its tomb context constitute a remarkable and rare conjunction of these two kinds of records in the Maya area.'

Guatemala is studded with pyramids and
ruins from the ancient Mayan civilization, which thrived between AD 250
and 900 and extended from modern day Honduras to central Mexico.

El Perú-Waka’, located approximately 
75km west of the famous city of Tikal, consists of nearly a square 
kilometre of plazas, palaces, temple pyramids and residences surrounded 
by many more square kilometres of dispersed residences and temples.

Queen K’abel’s portrait has appeared 
on Mayan plaques that associate her with the year 692 during the Mayan 
classic period, when she ruled the region with husband, King Wak K’inich
Bahlam II.

Nevertheless, 
the discovery of the tomb of the great queen was 'serendipitous, to put 
it mildly', Professor Friedel said, since the team at El Perú-Waka has 
focused on religious sites rather than burial locations.

'In
retrospect, it makes a lot of sense that the people of Waka’ buried her
in this particularly prominent place in their city,' said Professor 
Friedel.

Considered the greatest ruler of the 
Maya's Late Classic period, Queen K'Abel is thought to have reigned for 
at least 20 years between 672-692AD, according to Professor Friedel.

The Maya civilisation thrived in Central America for nearly 3,000 years, but reached its height between AD 250 to 900.

Noted for the only fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas, the Mayas also had highly advanced art and architecture as well as mathematical and astronomical systems.

Maya influence can be detected from Honduras, Guatemala, and western El Salvador to as far away as central Mexico, more than 1,000km from the Maya area.

The Maya peoples never disappeared. Today their descendants, like the girl pictured above, form sizable populations throughout the Maya area.

They maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger of pre-Columbian and post-Conquest ideas and cultures.

She
was the military governor of the Wak kingdom for her family, the 
imperial house of the Snake King, and she carried the title 'Kaloomte' -
translated to 'Supreme Warrior' - and was higher in authority than her 
husband the king.

Historians
believe that the community she ruled often battled the powerful king El
Zotz and his kingdom Tikal - just south of the border with present-day 
Mexico - where well-preserved ruins are a popular draw for tourists.

Olivia Navarro-Farr, PhD, assistant professor of anthropology at the College of Wooster in Ohio, originally began excavating the locale while studying as a doctoral student with Professor Freidel.

Continuing to investigate this area this season was of major interest to both because it was the location of a temple that received reverence and ritual attention for generations after the fall of the dynasty at El Perú.

With the discovery, archaeologists now understand the likely reason why the temple was so revered: K’abel was buried there, Professor Freidel said.

Guatemalan archaeologist Griselda Perez said: 'We had made a lot of discoveries of objects making reference to this queen and now to complete it with her remains is very important.'
