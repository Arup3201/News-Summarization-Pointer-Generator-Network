David Souaan, 20, a Serbian student standing trial for preparing terrorist acts in Syria had a video referring to the 'flag of tawheed flying over London'

A student arrested on his way to fight for Islamic State was caught with footage of a man having his throat cut, a court heard yesterday.

David Souaan also allegedly had videos of himself with automatic weapons.

The court heard the 20-year-old wanted to see the terrorist group’s black flag flying over Downing Street.

Anti-terror police discovered that the undergraduate at London’s Birkbeck College was a close supporter of hate cleric Anjem Choudary.

Yesterday, Souaan appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey where he is accused of preparing terrorist acts.

Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said he was a ‘nice, quiet, softly spoken young man’ when he arrived in Britain in September 2012 from Serbia to study international relations.

But the following year, the devout Muslim secretly spent his Christmas holiday with fighters in Syria and returned with hardline views.

He began calling non-Muslims ‘kuffar’, became serious when anyone mentioned women or alcohol and showed off photographs of himself in combat gear holding a gun.

Souaan was stopped at Heathrow by police as he was about to board a flight to Serbia with his mother on May 31.

They examined his laptop and mobile phone and uncovered a hoard of extremist material as well as evidence of his plans to return to Syria, the jury heard. 

Souaan is believed to have visited the country in both December 2013 and January this year. And on January 3, he sent a message to a friend reading: ‘Hello from Syria.’

He sent Skype and text messages praising Islamic State, saying he and his younger brother were prepared to die as martyrs and threatening to ‘cut the throats’ of opponents.

One image showed Souaan and four others walking through a derelict urban site carrying automatic weapons. Another video clip was described as ‘so graphic and so shocking’ it cannot be played in court. Instead, it will be described in detail to the jury by a police officer.

The Old Bailey heard extremist videos were found on David Souaan's computer and phone after his arrest

Outlining the horrific contents, Mrs Whitehouse said: ‘It shows a young man kneeling while his head is held back and another man cuts his throat. 

'The victim was pushed face down in the mud where his last breaths can be heard.’ 

Souaan, who has a Syrian Muslim father and a Serbian Christian mother, also had film of himself at a demo led by Choudary referring to the ‘flag of tawheed in London’.

Mrs Whitehouse said: ‘This is a reference to the fervent wish of Muslim extremists to see the tawheed – the black flag of Islam – one day flying in Downing Street.’

In May this year, Souaan wrote that he planned to fly to Belgrade in Serbia and ask his father for money to buy a weapon.

He said that the two brothers had been to the ‘front line’ and added: ‘I can’t wait for the summer to go to Syria, then I’ll be happy.’

The court was told Souaan arrived in Britain on a six-month visitor’s visa in September 2012 and was given a three-year student visa in October 2013. His passport, issued in 2009, showed he had also visited Syria in December 2009 and December 2010.

Souaan, who lived in student accommodation in Bloomsbury, Central London, denies preparing terrorist acts. The trial continues.
