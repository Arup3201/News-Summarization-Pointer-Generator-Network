Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have sparked controversy after stunting a crash at the scene of a horrific car accident which killed a woman.

Jane Sandalls, 26, died in a head-on collision with a newly-qualified driver who skidded on black ice at the bend on the B4437 in Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

But this afternoon, the BBC's hit show used the site - a few miles from Clarkson's Oxfordshire home - as the stage for a stunt, resulting in a dramatic crash which will be screened later this year.

However, the move has drawn concerns from some local figures, including Woodstock councillor Victoria Edwards, who used to rehabilitate boy racers.

She said: 'It is reckless and insensitive to use this spot for a stunt.

'There are plenty of places in Oxfordshire to stage a stunt. To do it at the scene of a crash is insensitive towards the family.

'The show is a very amusing one, but something like this is very serious.

'From working with boy racers, I know this kind of thing glamorises it so it is dangerous - and upsetting for relatives.

'My heart goes out to the family.'

Meanwhile, fellow Woodstock councillor Emma Jay added: ‘It’s very insensitive and extremely silly and crass of them.’

The stunt saw May plough his silver Peugeot into Clarkson's black model of the same car - metres away from the scene where Ms Sandalls suffered fatal head injuries in her Peugeot 106.

Made for TV: Police refused to be involved in the stunt which was filmed by the BBC for the hit-show

With the TV cameras rolling, a crash 
recovery truck arrived at the scene and May’s dented car was hauled out 
of the ditch while Clarkson’s convertible was towed out of the crop 
field.

Pictures show Clarkson and May scratching their heads just minutes after the stunted crash.

Clarkson’s hard-top convertible was left with front wing damage in the collision while May’s had to be towed away from the scene.

It is believed the decision to film the stunt at the tragic crash site was in no way intentional.

Controversy: James May has previously said he would 'carpet-bomb' the Oxfordshire town if he had the power

However, a BBC spokesman for Top Gear tonight refused to comment on the stunted crash and the fact it was staged at the same spot where Miss Sandalls was killed.

'I am quite happy with a 'declined to comment' response,' the spokesman said.

The stunt
 was filmed only a few miles from Clarkson’s Oxfordshire home and just a
 short distance from Burford, where James May was photographed two 
months ago, with his broken down car on a roundabout.

May
 is previously on record as saying that it he ever came to power, he 
would immediately 'carpet-bomb' the quaint Oxfordshire town.
