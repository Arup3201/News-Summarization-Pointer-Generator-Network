A multimillionaire romance novelist has testified at the trial of a con-artist psychic who allegedly defrauded her of $17million.

Jude Deveraux, who has had 30 books on the New York Times bestseller list, was in court in West Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday at the criminal trial of her long-time clairvoyant Rose Marks.

Ms Deveraux first sought the help of Marks in the 1990s following the death of her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident and in the midst of a painful divorce.

Fraudster: Nancy Marks, who operated under the name of Joyce Michaels, allegedly preyed on people's weaknesses to make money from them

The 65-year-old author said at the time she met Marks, whom she knew as Joyce Michaels, she was suicidal and trying to get out of a 'horrible, terrible' marriage, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Ms Deveraux told the court that she did not believe in psychic powers but was really looking for someone to listen to her problems.

She met Marks for the first time in a studio in midtown Manhattan where the psychic claimed to work from a 'special room' in St Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue.

After several meetings, Marks told the writer that she would help her achieve a 'peaceful divorce' - for a fee of $1,200. 

Although the author did not believe in Marks' psychic powers, she came to trust her after several of her prophecies appeared to come true. 

Marks managed to accurately predict that Ms Deveraux's husband would file for divorce - down to the hour that he would do so.

The clairvoyant also told the author to leave her apartment for a few days and change her locks because her estranged husband would show up.

Ms Deveraux told the Florida court today that this turned out to be the case and 'staff at her apartment building told her that her husband unexpectedly showed up and was angrier than anyone they'd ever seen', according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Marks later asked the author to hand over $1million which she would need to carry out her meditations - but that it would be returned to her.

The psychic told Ms Deveraux that the money would be kept in drawers in the cathedral room of St Patrick's. 

The author was told that 'money was evil' by the psychic and would attract evil if kept in her bank account. 

Marks, 62, along with other family 
members has been charged with defrauding $25million from clients through
 a network of psychic stores in Fort Lauderdale and Manhattan.

Most of that money - $17million  - is believed to have come from Ms Deveraux who amassed the vast fortune by selling 60 millions copies of her romance tales, which have titles such as Moonlight In The Morning, The Scent Of Jasmine and Scarlet Nights.

She is expected to be on the stand for several days.

At the time of Marks' arrest in 2011, prosecutors said ten 'psychic readers' 
from Fort Lauderdale allegedly conned customers out of a 
total of $40million, telling them that unless they handed over cash and 
valuables, they would be haunted.

At the time, prosecutors refused to identify the author who they said lost her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident, but several sources with knowledge of the case has named Ms Deveraux. 

The author, whose real name is Jude Gilliam Montassir, wrote on her MySpace page that she 'adopted a son, Sam Alexander Montassir… My son died at age 8 in a motorcycle accident.'

Police swooped on the soothsayers, who are all related by blood or marriage in August 2011 after a huge cross-state investigation dubbed 'Operation Crystal Ball'.

More than 400 rings, 100 watches and 200 necklaces – many of them from Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Gucci – were seized.

They all billed themselves as fortune tellers, clairvoyants and spiritual advisers and operated from shops in Fort Lauderdale.

The authorities said that many customers came to them as a desperate last resort, for instance hoping that they could be cured of a disease or put in touch with a deceased loved one.

It's alleged, however, that they were
 then warned that only by parting with money and possessions could they 
avoid being haunted or befalling terrible bad luck.

Customers were promised that their money would be returned once it was cleansed of evil spirits, but according to the indictment it was kept for personal used by the fortune tellers.

Victims included a woman with a brain tumour who was told she would receive 'positive energy'. She was reportedly left  unemployed and in danger of losing her apartment.

A person in Japan handed over $496,000 to the psychic readers and a man from Denmark sent about $186,000.

Mr Bardfield told the court that many of the victims were vulnerable.

'If you understood the severity of what these victims were going through, it makes more sense,' he said.

The defendants are facing 47 counts of wire fraud and face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.
