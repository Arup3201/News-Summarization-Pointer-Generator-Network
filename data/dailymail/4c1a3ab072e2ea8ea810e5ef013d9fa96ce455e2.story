A disciplined Blackburn frustrated Liverpool as the Championship side held their Premier League opponents to a scoreless draw and forced an FA Cup quarter-final replay.

Gary Bowyer's side kept the Reds plethora of superstars at bay and will host them again at Ewood Road, with his towering striker Rudy Gestede proving tough to contain for Brendan Rodgers' men, especially after the departure on a stretcher by Martin Skrtel following an ugly fall early on.

Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Anfield. 

Blackburn Rovers' Rudy Gestede proved a handful for Liverpool's defence in their FA Cup draw

LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1)  

SIMON MIGNOLET - 6.5

Looked shaky under his first high ball, but settled and produced a fantastic save to keep out a goal-bound header from Baptiste.

GLEN JOHNSON - 6 

Almost turned a cross into his own goal in the first half but got forward well as Liverpool seized the upper hand.

MARTIN SKRTEL - 6 

Knocked out inside two minutes after falling awkwardly when challenging Gestede and carried off on a stretcher.

DEJAN LOVREN - 6 

Had his hands full with Gestede after Skrtel’s exit and struggled with the big Blackburn striker at times.

LAZAR MARKOVIC - 6.5 

Lively down the Liverpool right but faded and replaced by Balotelli just before the hour mark.

JORDAN HENDERSON - 6.5 

Another reassured display from the Liverpool skipper. Unlucky not to break the deadlock with a late effort.

Lazar Markovic (centre) was lively for the Reds down the right side but was replaced by Mario Balotelli

EMRE CAN - 6 

Played in midfield again and looked solid enough without producing anything spectacular.

RAHEEM STERLING - 5.5

Didn’t make as much of an impression as he can and struggled to get into the game. Headed late chance wide.

PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5.5 

The little Brazilian has scored some memorable goals recently but didn’t have his shooting boots on, twice firing well off target

ADAM LALLANA - 5 

Guilty of poor distribution in the first half and did not have a big enough impact on the game for a player of his calibre.

Adam Lallana appeals for a penalty but he was legally dispossed by Blackburn's Matthew Kilgallon

DANIEL STURRIDGE - 6.5 

Became more of a threat as the game wore on, and had one great effort on goal end of first half, but will be disappointed not to trouble Blackburn more.

Subs: Ward, Toure (for Skrtel 11, 6) Lambert, Moreno, Sakho, Balotelli (for Markovic 59, 6), Williams.

Booked: Can 

Manager: Brendan Rodgers – 5

SIMON EASTWOOD - 7 

Had less to do than he might have expected early on but produced great reflex saves to deny Sturridge and Henderson.

ADAM HENLEY - 6.5

Battled well throughout but fortunate to avoid a booking for a late challenge on Can.

MATTHEW KILGALLON - 7.5

Made some great challenges, including one interception on Lallana in the first half, but rode his luck by holding back Sturridge in the box.

ALEX BAPTISTE - 7 

Declared fit after hamstring problem and so nearly emerged as Blackburn’s hero but his header was saved by Mignolet.

MARTIN OLSSON - 6.5 

Kept on his toes by Markovic but coped well on the whole to make sure Liverpool were limited to hopeful balls into the box.

LEE WILLIAMSON - 7.5 

Worked tirelessly in front of his defence to ensure that Liverpool did not have the time and space to pick off their Championship opponents.

CORRY EVANS - 6.5

Hasn’t been the best weekend for the Evans family, but he’ll be more than satisfied with a solid performance here

CRAIG CONWAY - 6 

Had Blackburn’s best chance of the first half but blazed high and wide with only Mignolet to beat from just inside the box.

TOM CAIRNEY - 6.5 

Impressed in a central role behind Gestede, particularly in the first half when Blackburn were more not pinned back in their own half. Booked for high challenge on Balotelli.

BEN MARSHALL - 6 

Replaced by Taylor midway through the second half after putting in a decent shift on the left side of Blackburn’s midfield

RUDY GESTEDE - 8 

Posed a real problem for the Liverpool defence from the moment Skrtel was injured. Won almost every high ball and provided a vital outlet for his team.

Subs: Spurr, Brown, Rhodes, Taylor (for Marshall 68, 6), Henry, Lenihan, Steele.
