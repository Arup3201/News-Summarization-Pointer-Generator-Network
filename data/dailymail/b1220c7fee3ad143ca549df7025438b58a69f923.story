Even the maximum limit advised by doctors is too much for expecting mothers, researchers claim (stock picture)

Just three drinks a week in early pregnancy can double the chances of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby - with middle class mothers most at risk, warn researchers.

Even two drinks a week - the maximum limit in official guidelines - increases the risk of preterm delivery or an unexpectedly small baby, says a new study.

But it shows middle class mothers habitually drink more than this at a time when the growing baby is most likely to come to harm from alcohol.

Researchers at Leeds University claim the only safe level of drinking in pregnancy - and when planning to have a baby - is none at all.

Researcher Camilla Nykjaer, of the university’s nutritional epidemiology group, said ‘Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy.’

The Department of Health recommends that women who are pregnant and trying to conceive should not drink alcohol, and never more than 1-2 units a week.

In the latest study led by Professor Janet Cade, 1,264 women at low risk of birth complications in Leeds completed food frequency questionnaires before and during pregnancy.

They were asked how often they drank alcohol, and what type it was, at four time points: in the four weeks before conception; and in each of the subsequent three months, or trimesters, throughout the pregnancy.

Alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than subsequently.

On average they had 11 drinks a week before getting pregnant, four during the first three months and just under two units a week later on.

Around half of the women drank more than the recommended maximum two weekly units during the first trimester.

Almost four out of 10 said they drank more than 10 units a week in the period leading up to conception.

Those who drank more than two units a week tended to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas.

Some 13 per cent of babies were born underweight after their mothers had exceeded the alcohol limit

Some 13 per cent of the babies born were underweight, 4.4 per cent were smaller than would be expected and 4.3 per cent were born prematurely.

Drinking during the first three months of pregnancy was most strongly linked to these outcomes, says a report published online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

Women who drank more than two weekly units were at double the risk of giving birth to an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who drank no alcohol at all.

But even women who didn’t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake at this time were still more likely to have a premature birth.

Drinking in the month before conception was also linked to a higher risk of restricted fetal growth, indicating this may also be a critical period, it says.

Dr Nykjaer said ‘We found the first trimester to be the period most sensitive to the effect of alcohol on the developing fetus.

‘Women adhering to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.

After the first three months, drinking alcohol has less effect on the growth of the baby

‘Although the Department of Health 
advises avoiding alcohol, the guidelines do give a bit of leeway and our
 research supports abstinence’ she added.

The issue of how much is safe to drink during pregnancy has caused controversy in recent years.

In
 2007, the Department of Health published guidance saying pregnant women
 should avoid drinking alcohol altogether, as should those trying to 
conceive.

Such women should never drink more than one or two units once or twice a week, it says.

This replaced previous guidance which said it was safe for pregnant women to drink one to two units of alcohol per week.

The Government said its update was not based on new research, but was to provide consistent advice to all women.

Drinking in the month before conception was also found to restrict fetal growth

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also advises women to avoid alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy.

Heavy drinking in pregnancy is linked to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in children, which can cause a range of physical, mental and behavioural problems.

Dr Nykjaer stressed that pregnant women should not be scared by the findings.

She said ‘We have found an effect in a population of women that helps reinforce guidelines but the effect in an individual woman would be quite small.’ She said women in the study may have under-reported their drinking because of the ‘taboo’ surrounding alcohol and pregnancy.

As a result the effect on prematurity and growth may have come from larger intakes of alcohol than the study suggested, she said.

Prof Andrew Whitelaw, Professor of Neonatal Medicine, University of Bristol, said ‘This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth.

‘As 38 per cent of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.’

Dr Ron Gray, Senior Clinical Research Fellow, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the study’s design made it difficult to draw any sound conclusions and the results could be due to chance or other factors.

He said ‘Further research on whether there is any completely safe amount to drink during pregnancy remains necessary, but in the meantime pregnant women should follow the advice from the UK Chief Medical Officers to avoid alcohol during pregnancy.’
