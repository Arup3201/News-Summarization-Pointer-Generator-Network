Manchester United loanee Nani was left bruised and bloodied as Sporting Lisbon were knocked out of the Europa League by German side Wolfsburg on Thursday.

The Portuguese was left with blood pouring from his nose after suffering a blow to the face in the goalless draw in Lisbon, although he managed to continue with the aid of some strategically placed cotton wool.

Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio was in inspired form as he protected his side's 2-0 first-leg result with first class saves denying Nani and others such as William Carvalho and Tanaka.

Nani has indicated that he would love to return to Old Trafford at the end of his loan spell, but has admitted he has not heard from Louis van Gaal... or any of his former team-mates.

'I used to speak to Antonio Valencia but I changed my number so it's difficult,' he said.

The 28-year-old, who signed a five-year contract extension at Old Trafford in 2013, says he made the decision to leave United because he thought playing time would be limited under Van Gaal.

'I knew with the new manager it would be more difficult because of the new system and my position in it,' he explained.

'I knew it would be hard to play. I decided to go to Sporting because it was an opportunity to come home, feel comfortable, get games and feel strong again.' 

Sporting Lisbon could not find a way past the German side and were eliminated 2-0 on aggregate
