Dougie Freedman insists he is not frightened by the full transfer embargo imposed on Nottingham Forest for failing to pay Peterborough a fee of around £1.5m in the purchase of Britt Assombalonga.

Forest have been automatically hit with a blanket ban on bringing in any players after missing the due date of January 30 for the latest installment on their club-record signing, it emerged last night.

It meant Forest were unable to sign anybody on transfer deadline day and also rules that when the emergency loan window opens next week they will be prohibited from adding to their squad – unless Peterborough receive the funds.

Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony was so infuriated he took to Twitter to brand the non-payment a ‘disgrace’. The League One club have complained to the authorities.

As per Football League regulations, there will be five per cent interest added on the missing cash whenever it is paid and Forest could be subjected to a further fine.

Forest were already under an embargo for breaking financial fair play rules, but able to bring in loan players and free agents as long as price guidelines were met.

But this fresh development has left new manager Freedman facing a headache on entering the job following the sacking of Stuart Pearce.

The former Bolton and Crystal Palace boss says he has experience of working in difficult circumstances and is adamant the squad is strong enough as it is. He also said owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi would meet his obligations.

‘I don't need to add anything so it is not top of my list to worry about,’ he said. ‘I've worked in these markets before where I've had no money. I worked when we are in administration at Palace.

Freedman is confident he can help Nottingham Forest climb up the table this season

‘With the squad I have now, I'm not frightened of the word embargo. We all fall on hard times, it's life. We are not the first business not to pay on time. But the chairman will honour what he owes.’

Club sources insist Freedman has signed an 18-month contract but there has been speculation the deal is initially six-months with a view to another year.

The 40-year-old is aware of the number of managers to have occupied the City Ground dugout since Al-Hasawi took charge – the Kuwaiti has fired four since July 2012 – but believes he can buck the trend by getting the best out of one of the Championship’s best squads.

‘This squad is underachieving, we have to start winning games, I'm sure we can do that. I am realistic. I am looking over my shoulder. I know the side has won three games in 21, so we have to make sure that changes. That is where my energy will be spent.

‘I can not sit here and say that we cannot win promotion, as Nottingham Forest manager.’

Pearce has been offered a senior advisory role at Forest which ambassador John McGovern likened to when Peter Taylor assistant Brian Clough. Pearce has not yet given an answer but is believed to have turned down the opportunity to continue his time at the club.

McGovern said the timing of Pearce’s sacking was correct, suggesting the manner of defeat at home to Millwall ‘was the straw that broke the camel’s back’. He added: ‘Stuart made some great signings but the record has been poor.’
