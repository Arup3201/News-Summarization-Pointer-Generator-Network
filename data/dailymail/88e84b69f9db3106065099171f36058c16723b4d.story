Bradley Wiggins' mod style has seen a resurgence among British men

Olympic fever has left us all wanting to emulate our Team GB heroes.

And gold medal-winning cycling supremo Bradley Wiggins is causing more of a to-do than most.

First British men got back on their bikes and joined cycling clubs to copy the Tour De France winner.

(Tthe British Cycling Club 
reported 1500 new members on the day Wiggins won the Olympic men's individual time trial).

Then UK men gave themselves sideburns.

And now they are trying to emulate Wiggo's look in the fashion department.

The Wiggo effect has led to sartorial 
sale spikes in the sort of 'mod-ish' clothing favoured by the pedal-pummeling Londoner, including polo shirts, parkas and loafers.

Martin
Googe, trends expert at men's fashion retailer High And Mighty, said he
has had a flurry of customers enquiring about getting Wiggo's look.

He said: 'It started with cut-out 
sideburns and everyone talking about Bradley's style with light-hearted 
praise, but what we are seeing now is a real determination to copy this 
gold medal-winning Olympic star's look.

'His style is deliberately 'mod', paying attention to key aspects such as tailored suits, skinny trousers and loafers.

'His icons are stars such as Paul Weller and The Who's Pete Townshend, and this is represented in the way he styles himself.'

The term 'mod', which derives from the
word 'modernist', was first coined in the 1950s as a way to describe 
British style-conscious modern jazz fans.

The term is synonymous with those who are fashionable, modern and popular.

Mr Googe continued: 'Customers are really keen to achieve the 'Wiggo' look and we are helping style them in this way.

'The
one thing we can’t advise on is achieving the mod attitude to life, but
dressing like their idol is part of the key to success in this area.'

Speaking about Wiggins, Mr Googe added: 'Men want to be friends with him and women love his charisma.

'We
still get requests, despite the fact he has been in the limelight for a
long time now, to kit men out in tailored, made to measure suits so 
they can achieve his clean-cut, chic look

'This is a polished 
appearance which many identified as having the glamour of New York 
whereas the Bradley Wiggins effect feels more quintessentially British
and is rightly appealing to a nation proud of our sporting achievements
at the games.'

Bradley Wiggins' summer successes in the Tour de France and in the men's individual time trial at the London 2012 Olympic Games, pictured above after winning, have led other men to try and emulate his mod style

Despite dressing like a mod when he goes out, Bradley Wiggins has spent the best part of his summer in Lycra, including here, winning the London 2012 Olympic men's time trial

We'd all like a Wiggo of our very own, wouldn't we?

But since he's a happily taken husband and father-of-two, we'll just have to settle for a paper one.

Retro graphic specialists Piper Gates Design have created a limited edition Bradley Wiggins 'mod' paper doll for you to cut out and keep.

Paper Wiggo comes wearing his Tour De France yellow jersey and black lycra shorts, but has the option to change into a skinny blue suit, a green parka, sunglasses and even an Olympic gold medal.
