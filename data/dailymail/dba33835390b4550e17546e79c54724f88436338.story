The Liberal Democrats will block further cuts to welfare unless David Cameron drops his opposition to to stripping rich pensioners of their benefits.

Nick Clegg warned David Cameron that any additional raid on Britain's vast benefits bill must 'start' with reducing handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes for well-off over-65s.

The intervention comes after Business Secretary Vince Cable said health and foreign aid should not be protected from spending cuts.

Many faces: Mr Clegg was very animated during a Q&A session with delegates in Brighton

Mr Clegg defended benefits cuts during a heated Q&A session with activists at the Lib Dem spring conference in Brighton.

He challenged Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to find savings from his own budget instead of demanding general cuts to welfare.

Mr Clegg said: 'Philip Hammond is making his case for his own department and is slightly scouring the Whitehall landscape to find what he considers to be the easy alternative to a lot of what are undoubtedly difficult decisions which need to be taken in relation to the Ministry of Defence.'

The Lib Dem leader insisted he was not opposed to further cuts.

'If you want to revisit welfare then let’s at least start with the people at the top. Vince Cable receives a bus pass in Twickenham; he doesn’t feel he needs it.

'Why are we giving – Vince isn’t a millionaire – but why are we giving these universal no-questions-asked benefits to millionaire pensioners when people on much lower incomes are having their support from the benefits system cut or curtailed.

'And the Conservatives don’t want to do that. So they don’t even in their great enthusiasm for welfare reform, let’s go after welfare; go after welfare, even when they want to do that they won’t start at the top and work down.'

Mr Clegg earlier met young activists and new Lib Dem MP Mike Thorrnton

Mr Clegg went on: 'There is real difference there and I have made clear to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor: The Liberal Democrats are not averse to welfare reform, we have done a lot, and we have just to £3.5billion in welfare savings in the last autumn statement

'But if you want to do more you have got to do it fairly, you have got to show that you are prepared to start at the top and work down.'

Earlier Mr Cable claimed further
cuts to his Business department would damage science and universities, as he 
repeated his call for extra spending on big infrastructure projects to 
kickstart the economy.

And he launched an outstpoken attack on Tories demanding deeper spending cuts as waging 'ideological jihad' against public services.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has questioned whether health, schools and defence spending should be protected from cuts

The Cabinet is embroiled in a growing public row about the need for further spending cuts in 2015-16, beyond the next general election.

Chancellor George Osborne has privately made clear he is relaxed about minister ‘fighting it out among themselves’ over where the axe should fall.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May are among the Tory ministers resisting more cuts to their budgets.

But Mr Cable is seen as the ‘shop steward’ of the so-called National Union of Ministers preparing to defy the Treasury.

In his fringe appearance last night, Mr Cable he said there would be 'pressure on public spending' for years to come.

And in an strongly-worded attack on the Tories, he added: 'What
we have to make absolutely clear is that there is a difference between 
managing public spending, controlling public spending in that context - 
having that financial discipline - and the kind of thing that a lot of 
right-wing Conservatives are wishing for, which is a kind of British Tea
Party,' he said.

'A kind of ideological jihad against public spending and public services.'

In an interview ahead of the Lib Dem 
spring conference in Brighton, Mr Cable warned serious damage will be 
done to British industry if the coalition continues to spare some 
departments from any cuts.

David
Cameron promised real terms increase in health funding and the defence 
equipment and schools budgets will be protected post-2015. The coalition
has also committed to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP.

Mr Cable insisted he is not ‘sticking his head in the sand’ but is angry that so many areas have been protected.

Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said he did not want the party being in government to be a 'blip' in its history.

In a rousing speech as the head of the party's election campaign said he wanted being in power to become a 'habit'.

And he told activists: 'You know, I'm sure that you, like me, have often told children and grandchildren that it's not the winning that matters, it's the taking part.

'Well let me let you into a little secret. That's b******.'

He added: 'Liberals have waited a hundred years for May 2010.

'And I dreamt every hour of my leadership of our party, that one day we would have the opportunity to be where we are now, in government; making a difference.'

He told the Guardian:
‘In opposition I did not think that was a sensible way to approach 
public spending. I have gone along with it in government in coalition, 
as part of the team and all that, and we did that in the first wave of 
public spending cuts.’

Mr Cable warned he will block further cuts to his Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. ‘We have delivered in the first spending round big spending cuts – not too many people give us credit for it but the administrative cuts have been 50 per cent.

‘We have lost a lot of civil servants – it is a much more efficient department. We have done 'brave things' in quotes like student fees, privatising the Royal Mail – radical things – but we have now got to the point where further significant cuts would do enormous damage to things that really do matter, like science and skills and innovation and universities.

‘Obviously, that is not very sensible given that the overall objective of the government is to achieve extra growth.

'I am always up for efficiency and quite brave reforms, so I am not just sticking my head in the sand, but you get to a point where the kind of cuts that are being considered will do serious damage to things that are essential for growth and the industrial strategy. I think we know there are large, alarming sums being sought.’

His criticism of the decision to international development from cuts comes as it emerged foreign aid is to be diverted through British companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes.

Firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

The radical move, to be announced by International Development Secretary Justine Greening next week, is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £11billion international development budget, which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts.

The Lib Dems gather in Brighton for their spring conference hoping to celebrate their victory in last week's Eastleigh by-election.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg hopes to use the spring conference to draw a line under a run of scandals

But the party has been dogged by 
questions about its handling of groping allegations against former chief
executive Lord Rennard and Chris Huhne's conviction for perverting the 
course of justice.

Senior 
party figures including Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam have been forced 
to deny being told by Mr Huhne's estranged wife Vicky Pryce that he 
forced her to take speeding points for him.

The
Lib Dems hope to use the gathering to distance themselves from the 
Tories, and Mr Cable has questioned Mr Osborne's focus on spending cuts 
to balance the nation's books, arguing more could be raised from taxes.

'The proposals for the one-year spending review, as we understand it, is for 85 per cent spending cuts versus 15% tax rises. Certainly as a Liberal Democrat I would question that.'

And he defied David Cameron's insistence that pensioner benefits like the winter fuel allowance should be protected from cuts.

The 69-yearold said: 'I have been getting the winter fuel payment for five years, it has been keeping me warm in Twickenham. I actually give it away.

'If we are in the realm of tough choices, why did we feel that this area is a sacred cow?'
