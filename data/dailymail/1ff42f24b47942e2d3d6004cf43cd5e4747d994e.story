The defendants in a father-son prostitution case were acquitted of sex trafficking Wednesday but found guilty of laundering millions of dollars and of promoting prostitution, leading at least one of their 'happy hookers' to weep for her pimps.

Three self-described prostitutes took the stand as character witnesses during the trial, all of whom described Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr, their admitted pimps, as caring men who took good care of them.

The verdict means the two men, though cleared of charges they coerced the women into their sex business, could face up to 15 years for laundering millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses.

Desiree Ellis, a prostitute who testified that she and Vincent George Sr. would fight but then make up--and even called him a 'teddy bear' on the stand--was seen being comforted after the mixed verdict had been read.

The men's supporters in the courtroom initially cheered the verdict, but the gallery fell silent when Manhattan Judge Ruth Pickholtz announced convictions against the Georges. The pair showed no emotion aside from slight smiles as they were led back to jail in handcuffs.

The father and son had faced up to 25-year terms on the sex-trafficking charges.

Despite the mixed verdict, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. called the outcome a victory.

'The goal of the prosecution was to dismantle a criminal enterprise from top to bottom,' he said. 'That goal has been achieved with the Georges. ... There is no fairy tale ending for these defendants.'

Defense attorneys - who called the 
women working for their clients 'happy hookers' - also claimed victory, 
adding that they planned to appeal the convictions.

The verdict 'recognizes that people 
have free will and the right to make choices whether or not you like 
those choices,' David Epstein, the son's attorney, said of the 
prostitutes.

The loving relationship between pimps
and prostitutes 'was vindicated,' Epstein added. 'It's a moral victory 
as well as a legal one.'

Prosecutors had alleged the 
prostitutes made as much as $500,000 a year for the Georges but got only
a few dollars a night themselves and had no bank accounts or property. 
They were threatened with beatings when they didn't bring in as much 
money as expected or were late to check in, according to wiretap 
conversations played at trial.

'Bring me my (expletive) money right now and get your ass back to work,' the son said to one woman.

The women painted a different 
picture, saying they were treated to nice cars, vacations in Florida and
affection from their pimps. Some lived together as 'family' in a house 
in Allentown, Pa., about 90 miles from New York, and drove in to the 
city at night to turn tricks for $300 a night, they said.

One witness, Heather Keith, has 
Vincent George Jr.'s nickname, King Koby, tattooed on her neck. She 
testified she was a drug-addicted 19-year-old stripper from upstate. He 
moved her to Allentown and helped her beat a cocaine habit, she said.

Witness: Danielle Geissler, 31, strode into the Manhattan courtroom to take the stand last Tuesday in the trial of the father of her child, who also doubles as her pimp

Keeping it classy: Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit accessorized with a large cross dangling from her neck, described Vincent George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' and said that she was in love with him

'I would say that I make my own choices,' said Keith, now 26. 'I am not a dumb person. I know what I'm doing.'

Another witness, 24-year-old Desiree 
Ellis, dismissed allegations that Vincent George Jr. abused her, calling
him a 'teddy bear.'

She once thought about leaving him. 
But once at a bus station, she changed her mind and asked if she could 
come back to their 'family.' He welcomed her with open arms.

'We kissed,' she said. 'We made up. We had a love session.'

Carrying on: Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, also defended the two men for whom she worked

Marked woman: Keith has a tattoo with George Jr's street name, 'King Kobe,' which the prosecutors suggested was a sign that she was the pimp's property.George Jr has now been cleared of sex trafficking charges
