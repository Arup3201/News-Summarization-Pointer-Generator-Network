Roman gladiators were subjected to strict training regimes, hours of physically exhausting tasks and battled to the death.

But instead of eating a diet rich in protein like modern athletes, evidence suggests they managed these tasks on a diet of grain, washed down with a ‘sports drink’ of vinegar and ash.

German researchers studied the collagen in the bones of Roman corpses found in a 2nd century cemetery to confirm theories of this vegetarian diet.

Researchers from the MedUni Vienna examined bones from a 2nd century gladiator cemetery (pictured) in Turkey. Using spectroscopy, stable isotope ratios were investigated in the collagen of the bones, and results show that gladiators mostly ate a vegetarian diet and drank a 'tonic of ashes' as a form of sports drink

The cemetery was initially uncovered in 1933, in the Roman city of Ephesos, now in modern-day Turkey.

At the time, Ephesos was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and had over 200,000 inhabitants.

Using spectroscopy, researchers from the Department of Forensic Medicine at the MedUni Vienna studied stable isotope ratios, including levels of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur.

Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’. Their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit, and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern-day athletes to protect their bodies

Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’.

The word ‘barley eater’ relates to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality. 

Research from MedUni in Vienna, which analysed bones found in a 2nd century Roman cemetery, has confirmed these claims. 

It found that meals of the individuals they examined would have consisted primarily of grain and meat-free meals. 

All individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food, while others ate beans.

The findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink, to give them energy, as a form of ancient sports drink.

Despite the strict training regime, gladiators were seen as 'assets' and were well cared for. 

Their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit, and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern-day athletes to protect themselves from blows. 

They also looked at the ratio of strontium to calcium in the bone mineral.

Levels of strontium indicate the amount of vegetable matter consumed over a lifetime, and the higher the levels the more likely that the diet is devoid of meat.

In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed.

The results revealed that meals consisted primarily of grain and meat-free meals. All individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food, while others ate beans.

The findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink, to give them energy, as a form of ancient sports drink.

‘Plant ashes were evidently consumed to fortify the body after physical exertion and to promote better bone healing,’ explained study leader Professor Fabian Kanz.

‘Things were similar then to what we do today - we take magnesium and calcium, in the form of effervescent tablets, for example, following physical exertion.

‘Calcium is essential for bone building and usually occurs primarily in milk products.’

In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed. This images shows a gladiator tombstone excavated in the Turkish cemetery. A further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators, who often came from different parts of the Roman Empire to Ephesos

Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have previously been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’.

The word ‘barley eater’ relates, in this case, to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality, explained researcher Professor Fabian Kanz.

According to the research, the difference between the diets of gladiators and the ‘normal population’ of the region is highly significant in terms of the amount of strontium measured in their bones.

A further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators, who often came from different parts of the Roman Empire to Ephesos.

The researchers are hoping that comparison of the bone data from gladiators with that of the local fauna will yield a number of differences.

The findings are published in the journal Plos One.
