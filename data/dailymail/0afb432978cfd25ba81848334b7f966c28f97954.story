David Cameron suffered a bloody nose over his  NHS reforms yesterday, losing a surprise vote in the House of Lords as senior ministers urged him to drop the Bill altogether.

Peers passed an amendment to the legislation demanding more money for mental health services by 244 votes to 240 – with three Lib Dem rebels voting against the Government.

The Bill had already been mauled in the Lords, with the Government tabling 137 amendments to it last week to appease the Liberal Democrats.

Whoa! David Cameron took a battering at PMQs over the controversial NHS bill, with Ed Miliband (right) urging a U-turn, and the Prime Minister was later handed another embarrassing defeat by the House of Lords over mental health changes

Yesterday, before the defeat, the 
Prime Minister had earlier offered only lukewarm support to his 
embattled Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in riposte to an attack by 
Labour leader Ed Miliband, saying: ‘The career prospects for my right 
honourable friend (Mr Lansley) are a lot better than his.’

Insiders still expect Mr Lansley to be
 moved at the next reshuffle after briefings from No.10 insiders that 
they want him ‘taken out and shot’ for his failure to sell the reforms 
to a sceptical public.

NHS reform: The proposed changes

A senior minister said that  disquiet 
is so advanced in Tory ranks that Cabinet members had urged Mr Cameron 
to drop the Bill in recent weeks.

The UK Faculty of Public Health today 
became the latest in a string of professional healthcare bodies to call 
for the Bill to be scrapped.

A survey of members found that 93 per 
cent believed the Bill would damage the NHS and the health of people in 
England and three-quarters wanted the Faculty to demand its withdrawal.

Faculty president Professor Lindsey 
Davies said: 'We are now calling on the Government to withdraw the Bill 
in its entirety, because it would be in the best interests of everyone's
 health.

'Our 3,300 members - experts in 
planning and providing for people's health - have been closely involved 
in trying to make the Government's proposed reforms work since they were
 first introduced.

'Based on our members' expert views, 
it has become increasingly clear that the Bill will lead to a 
disorganised NHS with increased health inequalities, more bureaucracy 
and wasted public funds.

'The Bill will increase health 
inequalities because there is the real danger that vulnerable groups 
like homeless people will not be included when health services are being
 planned. Clinical commissioning groups and service providers will be 
able to pick and choose what procedures they perform and which services 
they put in place.'

The Faculty voiced concerns about how 
emergency planning, screening and immunisation services will work under 
the Bill, which it said would leave the NHS with a shortage of strategic
 leadership and a lack of clarity about what happens if a private 
provider goes bankrupt.

Sources close to the Prime Minister 
denied that he ever considered that option but the minister said: ‘There
 is a case for abandoning the whole thing.’

Tory strategists fear that Mr 
Lansley’s failure to win over doctors or patients to his reforms will be
 used by Labour as a political battering ram.

‘No Tory MP knows what the point of 
these reforms is any more,’ one Tory MP said. ‘I would be surprised if 
Lansley was still here in a year.’

Senior sources talked down the defeat 
in the Lords, pointing out that the mental health amendment was more a 
technical disagreement than a fundamental challenge to the principles of
 the Bill. But one source predicted a ‘few bloody noses’ as the Bill 
continues its passage through the Lords.

In the Commons Mr Miliband said the 
Bill would introduce the biggest shake-up since the founding of the NHS 
in 1948 and would put GPs in control of much of the NHS budget.

‘This is a matter of trust in the 
Prime Minister,’ Mr Miliband told MPs. ‘Can he honestly look people in 
the Health Service in the eye and say he’s kept his promise of no more 
top-down reorganisation?

‘He knows in his heart of hearts that this is a complete disaster.

‘The reality about this Bill is this: 
the doctors know it’s bad for the NHS, the nurses know it’s bad for the 
NHS and patients know it’s bad for the NHS.’

Mr Cameron hit back, saying that the 
NHS in England under the Coalition is doing better than Wales’s Health 
Service, which is run by Labour and has been subjected to £400million in
 spending cuts.

He also accused Mr Miliband of using 
the furore over the Bill to boost his personal standing with his party, 
saying: ‘This is not a campaign to save the NHS, this is a campaign to 
try and save your leadership.’
