Hundreds of thousands of elderly people are struggling to get out of bed in the morning, wash themselves and prepare meals because they are not getting enough support at home, research reveals.

Nearly 900,000 over-65s are being denied help with essential everyday tasks by either carers or family and friends, according to Age UK.

This includes 500,000 who have difficulty having a bath, 190,000 who need help getting up, and 160,000 who are struggling to cook for themselves.

New research has revealed that 900,000 OAPs are being denied help at home with basic tasks such as cooking dinner or having a bath by either carers or relatives

The charity blames cuts to council budgets which has resulted in local authorities imposing much stricter criteria to decide who is eligible for state-funded help at home.

In some cases carers call for just 15 minutes a day meaning tasks are rushed or left undone.

The Daily Mail has long campaigned for improved care for older people at home and in hospital as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Age UK analysed the results of a national survey of 10,600 over-65s which assessed whether they were being given help with everyday tasks.

Nearly a third – 31 per cent – of those who struggle to carry out some daily activities said they did not get enough help from either carers or family.

Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘It beggars belief that one in three older people who need some basic help with daily living are now having to do without it.

‘When older people begin to need some help with essential daily tasks like eating and washing they should expect that it will be there for them, yet it is increasingly beyond their reach.

‘This is profoundly shocking, and it’s a direct result of our care system being scaled back at the same time as the population of older people is growing. 

'Our national failure to invest properly in social care not only deprives older people of vital support, it also makes no economic sense.

Charity blames council funding cuts meaning stricter criteria is used to decide who is eligible for home care

‘For example, an older person who struggles to eat is more likely to become ill and need expensive hospital treatment than if they receive some regular help with their meals: social care helps older people to stay well and keep their independence for longer. Older people deserve so much better.’

Based on its findings from the survey, the charity estimated that 870,000 people aged 65 to 89 are not being given enough support with basic everyday tasks. 

This figure also includes 200,000 who need help taking medication, 590,000 who dress themselves with difficulty, and 120,000 who need assistance with going to the toilet.

According to Age UK, the amount spent on social care has been cut by £1.2billion since 2010, over which time the elderly population has increased.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This research paints a depressing picture of a generation of older people facing loneliness, neglect and struggling to cope at home.

‘David Cameron has allowed home care support to be withdrawn from thousands of people. This is a false economy and one of the main causes of the intense pressure on A&E.’

Last year research by charity Leonard Cheshire Disability found that half of councils are granting elderly and disabled only 15-minute carer visits.

It said the slots were so short that vulnerable residents were forced to choose between having a cup of tea or going to the toilet.
