We thought we’d seen off the 
second-wettest year on record – but now scientists have found that 2012 
has left a legacy of less nutritious vegetables and fruit.

The heavy rain is being blamed for a reduced mineral content in a host of British crops.

Vital natural chemicals such as nitrates and sulphites were washed away, leaving many fruits, cereals and vegetables depleted.

The deluge ‘leeched’ crops of vital substances, according to one expert.

Some wheat harvests were found to have a third less iron and zinc than average.

A lack of sunshine last year has also led to some edible plants having reduced nutritional value.

The
findings are particularly bad news for non-meat eaters, who cannot 
easily get key nutrients such as iron, copper and zinc from other food 
sources.

Mike Gooding, a 
professor of crop science and agronomy from Reading University, said 
that nitrogen, which is crucial for plants to manufacture protein, is 
present in the soil as soluble salts and can be washed away by heavy 
rain.

He said: ‘You
need nitrogen to help the plant absorb iron. So we would expect to see 
less iron in last year’s harvest because of the wet weather.

‘Plants
can’t manufacture minerals, so if there are less of them in the soil, 
it stands to reason that there will be less of them in the crop.

‘When
you get a lot of leeching because of heavy rain close to harvest, then 
you will have a knock-on effect on the quality of the crop.

‘It is very obvious in cereals and the ensuing bread, and root crops like carrots, potatoes and parsnips.’

Prof Gooding also warned that fewer sunny days has resulted in less sugar and starch in our fruit, making it taste different.

But he said there is no need to consume more than the recommended five-a-day amount of fruit and veg.

Prof
Gooding’s advice is to vary your diet and ensure you eat produce 
harvested from diverse locations and grown at different times of year.

‘With
the diversity of fruit and veg on offer, there is no real reason for UK
consumers to suffer from a nutritional point of view,’ he said.

But
vegans and vegetarians may struggle with their limited diet, warned 
Professor Steve McGrath, an expert in soil protection at Rothamsted 
Research.

‘The wet weather has had an effect on the amount of nutrients in grains, fruit and vegetables.

‘Last
year’s cereals we tested have been found to contain a third less iron 
and zinc than you would normally expect.’ He said the wet weather had 
two effects on the crops.

Firstly, it removed nitrogen from the soil. Without it plants struggle to absorb other nutrients.

The second reason is that the 
wet weather benefitted some wheat crops, which had a bountiful harvest, 
diluting the amount of nutrients available for each grain.

But not all scientists agree that home-grown produce had suffered after the downpours.

Paul
Finglas, head of Food Databanks National Capability at the Institute of
Food Research, said: ‘There is little direct evidence that the poor 
weather has drastically reduced nutrient content in fruit and 
vegetables.

‘Most crops are 
efficient in obtaining the nutrients they need and so would contain a 
“normal” range of nutrients. The largest effect would be on 
water-soluble compounds such as nitrates, but most farming systems 
supply this through fertilisers.

‘Some
water-soluble vitamins may be reduced, such as vitamin C in potatoes. 
However, in the overall diet it makes little impact as we get our 
nutrients from a wide range of different fruit and veg.

‘The major effect the weather has had is on reducing overall yield, which in turn increases prices.’
