You may have been trying to get out of doing the lawn since last weekend, but as a nation we’ve been attempting to find a way to avoid it for more than 50 years.

Nowhere was that more obvious than at the Chelsea Flower Show yesterday as the latest gadgets for keeping life easy in the garden were revealed.

In 1959, Chelsea featured a ‘Garden of To-morrow’ showcasing a remote-controlled mower which the exhibitors said would revolutionise the way we cut our lawns.

Job done: the latest robotic lawn mower in the form of the Bosch Indego, which allows the owner to look on and relax

The mower, manufactured by Birmingham-based company HC Webb, was demonstrated to guests at the 1959 show who marvelled at its battery powered engine with enough power to cut grass at 2mph with a range of one mile.

The exhibition brochure also predicted that ‘mist propagation, automatic blinds and thermostatic controls for greenhouse heating and ventilation’ were ‘confidently expected within a few years.’

But it said that ‘plastics’ were ‘the most exciting development for gardeners’, with the exhibitors gushing that there were now ‘plastic cord and labels that would never rot’ and ‘polythene containers that allowed you to see the level of the contents without opening them.’

Some 54 years later, crowds at this week’s flower show showed equal enthusiasm when today’s cutting edge lawnmowers were demonstrated.

Far from the Webb model’s clunky remote control panel and cumbersome box that looked like Doctor Who’s assistant K9, the Indego robotic lawn mower drew intrigue from passers by as it meandered around a grassy patch at this year’s flower show.

The state of the art “robo-mower” handles the cutting of the grass without human intervention, while its owner ‘relaxes’ nearby.

It can handle lawns with an area of up to 1,000 square meters (10,764 sq ft), although after doing about 200 (2,153) it will have to take itself back to its charger to top up its lithium-ion battery pack.

It is able to find that charger on its own, and takes 90 minutes to fully recharge.

Once re-charged it will return to the point where it left off, and continue mowing. It takes about 20 minutes to mow each 200 sq m – which is four times quicker than other robotic mower previously made, the company claims.

Part of the reason for its speediness is the fact that it mows in orderly sequential rows, like a farmer swathing their crops.

It is also able to sense obstacles or surfaces it should not mow, such as gravel, and automatically figures out how to adjust its mowing pattern in order to avoid those.

It is better for the grass than similar robotic lawn mowers and is more energy efficient because it works systematically around the garden rather than mowing randomly in a pingball effect.

The mower costs £1,399 from B&Q and is British-manufactured for Bosch in Stonemarket, Suffolk.
