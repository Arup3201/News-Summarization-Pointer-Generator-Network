Pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities, prompting expert warnings of a plague of 'super-rats'.

Information released to Labour by councils  has revealed deep cuts in the amounts being spent on controlling vermin.

Across 200 local authorities in England, pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010.

There has also been a 16 per cent cut in the amounts spent on street cleaning.

Some authorities insist they have taken steps to provide better value for money, accounting for reductions in budgets. But others admit they have stopped providing pest control services altogether.

Traditionally, people have been able to call out pest control officers from their local authorities if their homes are infested with mice, rats, wasps or other pests. Many councils have offered free assessments, and then made subsidised charges for proofing, poisons or other recommended measures.

The decline in local authority services means more people are likely to attempt ineffective and sometimes dangerous DIY solutions, increasing the numbers of pests, experts said.

Reports this year suggest that rats in the UK are becoming bigger, and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control.

So-called 'super rats' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year.

Labour MP Hilary Benn said pest control budgets had been reduced by a quarter in real terms

Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons.

In counties including Berkshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent, all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison.

Hilary Benn, Labour's shadow communities and local government secretary, said: 'Street cleaning and pest control budgets have been reduced by a quarter in real terms and Eric Pickles has failed to live up to his vows before the last election on waste collection.

'Taken in the round, his failure to work with councils to deal with the reductions in their funding risks undermining the cleanliness that makes us proud to live in our communities.

'This is worsened by the fact that his cuts have been unfairly distributed, with leafy Elmbridge in Surrey seeing an increase in spending power over this Parliament while less wealthy communities – urban and rural – have been hit far harder.

'Labour would devolve power and money to local areas and work with them to find savings through collaboration, allowing them to protect the frontline services residents expect and rely on.'

The biggest budget cuts have been seen in the North West, where spending on pest control is down 25 per cent, and the South East, by 24 per cent. The West Midlands, by contrast, has all but maintained spending, with only a two per cent cut since 2010.

David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: 'Any reduction in pest control budgets is potentially going to result in more people attempting DIY solutions.

'The big issue around DIY pest control is the pitfalls of untrained people applying pesticides that could potentially cause harm to themselves, neighbours, or, more likely, non-target animals such as domestic pets or other wildlife that may visit a garden where someone is trying to control rats without a full understanding of the repercussions or effects that anticoagulant rodenticides can have further down the food chain.

East Midlands 16%

East of England 23%

London 21%

North East 15%

North West 25%

South East 24%

South West 16%

West Midlands 2%

Yorkshire and Humber 23%

'It is also key to remember that pests are a symptom of a particular environment - while the rats are the obvious problem, they may only be present in a certain area because of issues around fly-tipping or less apparent problems such as drainage defects. The amateur user of a pesticide will probably not understand this, may fail to find the root cause of the problem and may therefore fail to gain control quickly and sustainably - in other words reacting to the rats, rather than taking a more proactive and long term approach to the wider issue.'

Communities Minister Brandon Lewis rejected Labour's criticism. He said: 'Under Labour, council tax doubled and bin collections halved. As minister for DEFRA, Hilary Benn was the Labour architect of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes - the Torquemada to Labour’s town hall Binquisition.

'Conservatives in Government are supporting weekly collections and abolished Labour's plans for bin taxes which would have see fly-tipping soar. 

'Councils need to make savings to help pay off Labour's deficit, but they should do so by protecting frontline services and more joint working, better procurement and cutting waste. By contrast, the Labour Government in Wales now wants councils to empty bins monthly. Labour aren't friends of the Earth, they're friends of the rats.'
