'I don't want to call it destiny,' says Andy Lee, gazing out across the Las Vegas skyline from his penthouse suite on the 45th floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 'But something tells me the stars are aligning and this is my time.'

It was a decade ago this week that Lee first set foot in Vegas as an amateur with a dream of one day making his mark on this famous strip of Nevada desert. So excited was the East London-born Irish kid that he filled up three disposable cameras with photos of him alongside all the famous boxers he met.

Lee was the guest of his then-trainer Emanuel Steward, the fabled Hall of Famer, who was in town for Vitali Klitschko's fight with Danny Williams at the Mandalay Bay. A lot has changed since then: you'd never find a disposable camera on the strip these days, Klitschko is currently the mayor of Kiev and Steward passed away aged 68 in 2012.

For Lee these have been 10 years of ups and downs. In the ring, he lost his only other world title fight in June of that same year – against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr - and then had to cope with the loss of his mentor just four months later.

So this trip, to take on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title at an Arena some 45 floors beneath his suite, is an emotional one for the 30-year-old.

He said: 'Being back here brings back a lot of memories. America has a unique feel as a country but you can go away from it for a while but as soon as you touch down it all comes back – the people, the smells, the look of the place.

'It's nice to be back. It's almost 10 years to the day since I first came here. I was still amateur at the time and Emanuel invited me out to take it all in. Here I am 10 years later about to fight for my own title – it's funny how things work.

'I'll be honest, when I first started coming here I never really liked it. It's pure capitalism, this is where you come to waste money – very rich people and very poor people. But then I started enjoying it, you just can't take it too seriously when you're here. They say it's a playground and you have to try and treat it like that.'

But he and his trainer Adam Booth are both deadly serious when it comes to the threat posed by Korobov.

The Russian was arguably the planet's finest amateur in his pomp but he is yet to transfer to the paid ranks the dazzling talent shown in the vest and headguard.

Korobov is undefeated in 24 fights but, despite being a year older than Lee at 31, is nowhere near as experienced as a professional. That could be key, according to the Limerick southpaw, who has fought and won three times here in Vegas during the early stages of his career.

He added: 'I have all the experience for it now. I wasn't good enough for it before in terms of being a fighter and maybe I needed to learn more. If it had happened then maybe it wouldn't have lasted but now it's going to happen, I'm going to win and I'm a better fighter for it.

'It's all coming together at the right time. Even with the bad experience I had with the Chavez fight, had I not had that then, I wouldn't be this well prepared now.'

The majority of the preparation for this fight has been done at another of the world's famed gambling districts, Monte Carlo, where Booth now lives. The man once labelled 'The Dark Lord' steered David Haye to the WBA heavyweight title then George Groves to the brink of world honours.

Lee describes him as 'hands-down the best trainer in the world' and also explained why Vegas is to thank for Booth's love of boxing.

'Look across there,' Lee says, pointing to a white building some 500m away. 'Caesars Palace, where Thomas Hearns and Sugar Ray Leonard fought for the first time in 1981 – and of course Emanuel Steward was Hearns' trainer.

'That was that fight that got Adam into boxing, he was taken to the cinema to watch it and that's where it all started for him. Now, here he is, with me, one of Emanuel Steward's fighters, about to fight for a world title and we can see the place from our balcony.

'If that's not destiny, if you want to call it that, I don't know what is.'
