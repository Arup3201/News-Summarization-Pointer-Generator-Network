The Zumba instructor in Maine who admitted to being prostitute had sex with as many as five different men per day and took only 15 minute breaks in between each one.

Text messages revealed that the former fitness instructor-turned-prostitute Alexis Wright would not meet with her clients unless her business partner, a 57-year-old man who lived 100 miles away, was watching the trysts in real time via Skype.

The messages between Wright and insurance agent Mark Strong Sr. were obtained Tuesday through a records request by the Portland Press Herald. They were shared with the jury but kept from the public by the judge during the trial, and have only been released today.

On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy

The communications included spreadsheets Wright used to keep track of her clients, with names, dates, times, sex acts and payments.

Messages from February 9, 2012, show how busy Wright was having sex with men for money, with as little as 15 minutes between encounters, the newspaper reported.

'I had sex with Larry, Pete and Paul on Thursday,' she writes.

'And Michael, Pete, Pat, Jason and Mike today.

‘Wow. Two days, ten clients.’

Wright pleaded guilty last month to 20 counts including prostitution for using her studio in Kennebunk, a village known more for its sea captains' homes and beaches than for crime, as a front for prostitution.

Strong was convicted of 13 counts relating to the promotion of prostitution.

Video and testimony during Strong's trial indicated Wright's trysts were captured by a hidden video camera in a sophisticated operation featuring meticulous ledgers and calendars and the use of license plates to identify clients.

Strong, who has acknowledged having an affair with Wright, monitored the sex acts from his office.

In one text, Wright wrote: ‘I love you Mark :-)’.

Only texts sent by Wright were released, and none that Strong may have sent to her in response.

Video recordings that were aired during the trial show Wright approaching the camera and checking that it was hidden under a pile of lingerie before each client came into the studio.

On January 25, 2012, she sent a string of texts to Strong when a client was due to arrive but she would not meet with him until she know that Strong was watching via Skype.

'You must have gotten tied up somewhere. I can't reach you and Jared is already in the area. I won't see a client without your permission and viewing so I'll wait to hear from you I guess,' Wright wrote in a text.

Putting on a show: Dressed to the nines and sporting heavy makeup and bright manicure, Wright quietly answered 'guilty' 20 times when the judge read the counts

'I can see him sitting across the street.

'I'm sure he can see my car but if he knocks, I won't answer unless you're in your office. :-('

'Jared is sitting across the street waiting to hear from me. I'll wait until 1:30 but I'm assuming that you're not heading into the office,' she wrote at 1.13pm.

The Kennebunk prostitution scandal attracted international attention in the fall after it was reported that Wright's ledgers indicated she had more than 150 clients and made $150,000 over 18 months.

Authorities then set the town abuzz with word that they would be charging each of the johns, leading residents to wonder who they were.

'He's weird. He doesn't like things that feel good. He likes to be tortured,' Wright wrote of one unidentified client.

Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex

'To each his own I guess, but there is something about him that is very strange.'

The scores of people charged with engaging Wright's services include a former mayor, a high school hockey coach, a minister, a lawyer and a firefighter.

Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, pleaded guilty under an agreement that calls for 10 months in jail. Her sentencing is set for next month.

Strong, 57, served 15 days in jail and was released this month.

His defense lawyers had characterized him as being infatuated with a younger woman and making bad moral decisions but never profiting from the prostitution operation.
