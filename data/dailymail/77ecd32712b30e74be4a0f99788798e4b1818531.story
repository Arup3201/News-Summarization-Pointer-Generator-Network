Ed Miliband was 'deeply moved' by a surprise meeting yesterday with the son of a woman who hid out with his own relatives during the Second World War.

The Labour leader was approached by Mendel Mandelbaum just before speaking to students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

He was shocked to hear Mr Mandelbaum's mother was sheltered by the same family - in a tiny Belgian village - as his own aunt and grandmother.

In all 17 of his relatives on his father's side, who were hidden there, survived Nazi persecution.

Mr Mandelbaum went to the university - where his son Jonathan works - to meet the Labour leader after hearing about the connection the night before.

He and his wife Justine then paid an emotional trip to Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, and laid a wreath to commemorate the dead.

Mr Miliband's father Ralph, then 16, and his father Samuel, fled their home in Brussels and got the last boat to England from Ostend when the Germans invaded in 1940.

But his mother RenÃ©e and younger sister  Anne-Marie, then 12, stayed behind, and when they feared imminent deportation to a concentration camp, fled to the village of  Montignies-lez-Lens.

Mr Miliband praised the 'incredible courage' of the Vos family of Catholic farmers, who hid them until the end of the war.

'Eventually they sheltered 17 members of my family and also sheltered this blokeâ€™s family. It shows how this country is bound up with stories of dislocation, refugees, grief and loss' he said.

He told how his grandmother was forced to flee Brussels in the summer of 1942, after she was taken to the city's Gestapo headquarters where the Germans had intercepted a letter from her son that revealed details about his escape to England.

She was questioned for four hours but told them nothing, before being released.

The Milibands also met children at the 'Blue Box Recreation Centre' in Sderot near the border with Israel and the Gaza Strip

The centre is fortified to withstand rocket attacks from Gaza who having been firing Qassam missiles for the past 13 years on the Israeli border town making it unsafe for children to play outside

Mr Miliband said: 'The Gestapo called in my grandmother and, extraordinarily, let her go, at which point she thought it was time to leave.

'She used to sell hats at a market and knew a woman who was a farmer who sold eggs. They had gone to visit them one summer. Somehow there was a communication and they said come join us.'

The family was eventually re-united after the war in London - but 43 members of his wider family did not survive.

During his visit to the museum, part of a two day tour of Israel and the West Bank, and his first major trip as Leader of the Opposition, he said: 'It is a reminder of the terrible loss that my family suffered, the loss of so many Jews around the world to the Nazis and the people who showed incredible courage to save lives and save Jews.'
