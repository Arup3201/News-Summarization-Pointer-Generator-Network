A German man has denied claims that he flushed his girlfriend's cat down the toilet to kill it after he learned that she planned to end their relationship.

Mandy Hauser, 20, called police when she came home to find bloodstains on the wall and the body of her cat lying lifeless in the toilet bowl.

She told police that she had rushed home
 after getting a call from boyfriend David Heinrich, 21, to say: 'There 
is something wrong with the cat, I think you'd better come home.'

He denied torturing the cat to death and told a court in Plauen, a town in Saxony in east-central Germany, that he had simply been treating the animal because it suffered from fleas.

He said he had given it flea powder and then tried to wash the flea powder off.'

The court case was adjourned until the end of the month for an autopsy on the cause of death to be completed by a local vet.

Mandy, who works as a sales assistant at a store in the town, said: 'I just can't get out of my head how painfully Tiger must have died.'

She claimed that he wanted to kill the cat to get revenge because she wanted to dump him.

She said: 'My cat Tiger was like a child to me. I still have nightmares about the way he died and about finding his body.'

The case continues on 28 January.
