She grew up in Lewisham, south London, and only converted to Islam as a teenager, but Khadijah Dare is now said to be seen as a 'top priority' for British intelligence services.

Two years ago, Dare swapped her 'comfortable life' in Britain, where she was known for her dimples and her love of her mother's home cooking, for the horror of Syria, where she has joined the terror group ISIS.

Now, after appearing in an ISIS recruitment video calling on British Muslims to 'stop being selfish' and give up their families and studies to join the front line in the Middle East, Dare - a pseudonym - is said to be top of MI6's list.

A security source said: 'Her notoriety has evolved so rapidly that she has achieved a celebrity-like status among jihadists fighting in Syria and those who are thinking of travelling abroad to join ISIS.'

The source told the Mirror: 'Dare has now become a top priority.' 

Dare, a mother of two young boys who is married to Swedish jihadi Abu Bakr, is believed to be one of the British-born Muslim terrorists that will be targeted by new anti-terror measures to be announced by the Prime Minister this afternoon.

Among the measures expected to be unveiled include more stringent controls on British-born jihadis who board flights back to the UK from Turkey and Germany, and plans to strip suspected terrorists of their passports.

But Dare appears to have no wish to return home just yet. 

In a video posted online calling on Muslim extremists to leave Britain and fight, she extolled the virtues of her adopted religion, saying: 'I'm not oppressed; if I was oppressed I wouldn't be a Muslim right now.

'If I thought Islam was an oppressive religion, I would have left Islam.

'Islam has made me free.'

In an attempt to stir up racial hatred in a video that speaks of Muslim children being 'slaughtered', she added: 'These are your brothers and sisters as well and they need our help, so instead of sitting down and focusing on your families or focusing on your studies, you need to stop being selfish because time is ticking.' 

Hours after the beheading of American journalist James Foley at the hands of a British jihadist, Dare gloated on social media at his execution and vowed that she would be the first British woman to kill a US soldier.

Arranged marriage: She became radicalised online before marrying her Swedish husband Abu Bakr

Dare was gleeful that the 'UK must be shaking up' after the execution and from her home in the Syrian scrub she tweeted: 'Any links 4 da execution of da journalist plz. Allahu Akbar. UK must b shaking up haha. I wna b da 1st UK woman 2 kill a UK or US terorrist!' 

Dare's Twitter account is already notorious – not least because of the photograph of her then four-year-old son Isa, meaning 'Jesus', holding an AK-47 rifle.

Her Twitter feed, which is currently suspended, was littered with images of dead bodies and Islamic State propaganda, juxtaposed with pictures which belie the normal young girl she once was.

The irony of the images she has posted of 'beautiful' sunsets, baby seals and a kitten in a teacup alongside those of extremist horror are apparently lost on her.

Childhood friends of Khadijah Dare – one of her many post-conversion pseudonyms – told the Evening Standard that she was 'very endearing and sweet.

'She was a bit of a tomboy but sometimes at weddings I'd see her wearing tight jeans and platforms. She also had braces and dimples and was very cute.' 

She liked to watch football on TV as a child, and loved Chinese food and her mother's home cooking.  When she was older she went to a local college to study media studies, film studies, psychology and sociology, and was a popular young girl.

But at 18, four years ago, she converted to Islam and began worshipping at the Lewisham Islamic Centre – which has links to both the Woolwich killers of Lee Rigby and radical cleric Abu Hamza.

She admitted in a Channel 4 report last year that when she began wearing the full face veil in Lewisham people on the street told her to 'go back to her country', to which she replied: 'I was born round the corner'.

In the same footage she urges other Muslims to 'stop being so selfish...focusing on your families or studies' and implores them to join her in Syria and join the holy war.

Dare allegedly became radicalised online and moved to Syria in 2012, before marrying her Swedish Muslim jihadist husband Abu Bakr, arranged by his mother.

Bakr is fighter with the Sunni jihadi militia known as Katiba al Muhajireen - the battalion of migrants – which joined forces with Islamic State and wants to create an Islamic caliphate.

The Londoner has admitted that her parents are unaware of her new life, and as well as the pseudonym Khadijah Dare she goes by 'Umm Isa' meaning 'mother of Isa' and Muhajirah fi Sham, meaning 'Immigrant in Syria'. 

As her toddler sons Isa and Abdur Rahman stumbled about her gun-littered living room floor last year, Dare was unrepentant of her decision to move to Syria and of her departure from the girl-next-door who traded her promising British life for one of violence and hatred. 

Muslims at the Lewisham mosque where Dare used to worship have insisted it was not a breeding ground for terrorists.

One woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'I know Khadijah. She attended the mosque a couple of years ago.

'She's a very nice girl, a good person, I had no idea she was fighting in Syria. I'm shocked to hear it, it seems so unlike her.'
