Arrested: Jonathan Adam Roldan, 23, was arrested at his home in East L.A

A East Los Angeles high school volleyball coach has been arrested for allegedly engaging in lewd acts with two teenage female students.

Jonathan Adam Roldan, a volleyball coach at Esteban Torres High School, was arrested at his home in East L.A., according to the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau.

The 23-year-old is accused of having sexual contact with a 15-year-old student from the school, officials said.

The girl went up to school officials and reported what had occurred, who in turn contacted deputies, according to the news release.

During the investigation, sheriff’s detectives were able to identify a second 15-year-old student who allegedly was inappropriately touched by the suspect, officials said, reported KTLA.com.

A letter about the arrest went home with students Monday, reported NBC Los Angeles.

'The Los Angeles Unified School District will place him on unpaid compulsory leave when he’s formally charged, pending resolution of the criminal matter,' the district said in the statement.

'If convicted, he will be dismissed. Superintendent John Deasy is recommending moving ahead with the dismissal process at the earliest opportunity.'

Roldan is held on a $1 million bail and was scheduled to appear in the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center on Tuesday.
