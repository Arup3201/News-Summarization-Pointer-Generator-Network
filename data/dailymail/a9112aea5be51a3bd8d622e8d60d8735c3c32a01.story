His pal Ryan Reynolds is busy preparing to welcome his first baby with Blake Lively so Gerard Butler has taken over the helm at Hugo Boss.

The Scottish actor has replaced Ryan as the face of Hugo Boss' new male scent and he proves his worth in a dapper campaign shoot.

The 44-year old is promoting the new Boss Bottled Collector's Edition, which aims to promote the ‘Man of Today’ - a gentleman who defines his own success rather than allowing success to define him.

The brand snapped up the A-list actor because, they say, he is passionate yet real; gritty but refined; in touch with emotions, and compassionate while driven. 

Speaking in a behind the scenes video, Gerard opens up about those values and how he stays true to himself in the fast-paced world of showbiz.

'To stay true to those values I have is as important as life itself,' he said.

'It's all part of growing up and maturing and learning how to be a man and how to grow up and what it means to be a knight and a gentleman.'

A trained lawyer, Butler broke into acting in the mid 90s thanks to minor roles in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies, among others.

Since then, his career has gone from strength to strength and career highlights include landing the lead in Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera, as well as roles in The Bounty Hunty and P.S. I Love You (and who could forget those abs in his portrayal of King Leonidas in 300?).

'Once I set something down for myself, if it's in life or a job or a movie, I've got to reach it,' he said about his success and ambition.

'It's setting something up that you've got to move towards because otherwise it just feels like a very nebulous idea.'

But first, let me take a selfie: Gerard took time out on set to have a quick snap with a female fan

Butler, who recently returned from a holiday with a mystery brunette, also explains how he manages to balance his work/life schedule. 

'Work/life balance is very, very important mainly because there were times in my life when there was too much life and there's been times when there's been too much work,' he said.

'I think we all need our sacred space. A man has to have his time alone to gather his thoughts. It's what this campaign is - a time alone to sit and assess and understand who we are and what is our purpose.'

He may be 44 but Gerard's future is looking bright - he recently wrapped up filming the Gods of Egypt with The Face contestant Yaya Deng.

'This is the most exciting period of my life; I'm relaxed about everything. I believe everything is going to pan out exactly the way that it should be; it's that acceptance,' he said.

'It's more the spiritual side of life, I think when you get to this age you start going "it's not how much money you can make, it's how you can develop as a being" - that would be over the next five years.

'Over the next fifteen years, I'll probably just try to stay alive,' he joked.

Remember this? Butler portrayed Leonidas, the king of Sparta who, along with 300 soldiers, battles to prevent the  Persian army from invading all of Greece in  action drama  300 in 2007

Ladies man: He also stole our hearts in the film P.S I Love You alongside Hilary Swank
