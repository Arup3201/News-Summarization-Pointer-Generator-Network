She broke down in tears during the first day of her divorce court battle on Wednesday.

But just hours later Bethenny Frankel appeared to be in much better spirits.

The 43-year-old former talk show host kept a brave face as she strolled down the street with her adorable four-year-old daughter Bryn in Manhattan.

Bethenny beamed in a pink top, distressed denim jeans and a pair of flip flops while pushing her bundle of joy in a stroller.

She wore her dark tresses down past her shoulders with little make-up and a pair of dark sunglasses which hid her eyes that hours earlier were reportedly covered in tears as she plead her case on the witness stand.

With obviously much on her mind, the SkinnyGirl mogul kept quite busy by checking her smartphone while picking up Bryn from daycare.

A lot on her mind: Despite her legal troubles, she appeared to be in much better spirits

The battle between Bethenny and her ex Jason Hoppy for custody of their daughter is shaping up to be incredibly nasty.

On Wednesday the attorney for the 43-year-old reality star accused her 42-year-old estranged spouse of hacking into her personal email and 'sought to obsessively control her every move through their daughter,' according to a report from PageSix.

The allegations were made during opening statements in a New York City courtroom.

Frankel has hired lawyer Allan Mayefsky, who represented Katie Holmes in her split from Tom Cruise.

Mayefsky claimed the Bravo star's husband went 'to war' once their union crumbled in 2012. 'He threatened to destroy her,' Frankel's attorney said.

'He had her followed and spied on along with their daughter. He hacked into her most private personal email.'

​'​He has 
consciously placed his desire for revenge … over the best interests of 
this family and particularly the child,' Mayefsky concluded.​ ​'He has 
sought to obsessively control their every move through their daughte​r.'

Mayefsky said his client is a 'very, very involved mother' whose success will benefit the child.

While Bethenny is insisting on primary custody and sole decision-making authority for Bryn, Jason ​is asking for shared custody.

While under
 attack, Jason showed no emotion. His attorney Bernard Clair, who has 
also repped Simon Cowell's baby mother Lauren Silverman, also accused 
the Skinnygirl businesswoman of wanting to get even.

One
 of the examples mentioned was how Bethenny allegedly stripped their 
shared condo on Hudson Street when she vacated it earlier this year.

'The clothes were gone, the favorite stuffed animals gone, the favorite dollhouse gone,' Clair said.

 love: Bethenny and Jason enjoyed a break in St. Barts after tying the

He argued 
the change made Bryn upset. When her father went to cook her a meal to 
calm her nerves, he said the kitchen was almost empty.

'He
 found that every single utensil had been taken but replaced with 
plastic knives, forks and spoons like you would pick up from a takeout 
place. One pot was left,' Clair said.

According to Clair, Bethenny removed all the personal belongings from the home in order to 'relegate the father of her child to a walking sperm bank.'

Clair
 also said Frankel used 'the child as a prop … in the pursuit of her own
 career and her own brand.' He said she 'embarked on a secret endeavor 
to have a children’s book published' this coming September about Bryn’s 
life.

'Ms.
 Frankel even arranged for the illustrator to come to her home to follow
 this child around so that every likeness and every sense of the child 
could be presented,' Clair said. 'And that’s not all: This children’s 
book has the Skinnygirl logo, Skinnygirl being the brand of Ms. Frankel,
 throughout its pages.'

According to RadarOnline, Bethenny was in 'tears' while on the stand, claiming her estranged husband said she was 'disgusting.'

'If you don’t want to be with me and you’re ending this marriage, I want nothing to do with you ever again. I’m going to destroy you. I'm going to have you and your publicist crying and crumbling in a corner,' she revealed Hoppy had told her.

She added that Jason said, 'You’re already losing fans. I’m going to ruin you' and also saying, 'You’re dead to me. I want nothing to do with you. You think I want to be with you on the holidays? You’re a piece of s—. You’re garbage. You have no idea what I’ve got on you.'

The former Real Housewives of New York City star claims Jason's behavior got even nastier around the house.

According to Bethenny, following their split her estranged husband 'would pee and poop and leave it in the toilet.'

During story time with his daughter, Hoppy would allegedly say things to Bryn like, 'Mommy should be the witch. She's a great witch. You'll be the princess and I'll be the prince,' said Frankel.

She claims he even altered Bryn's strictly vegetarian diet by allegedly feeding their daughter 'hot dogs, bacon and fried chicken' without discussing it with Bethenny.

The couple are also sparring over religion as Frankel claimed they agreed to baptize their daughter at Jason's parents' request but did not plan to raise Brynn in the Catholic faith, reported People.

'That and going [to church] on high holidays was the extent of Bryn's religion,' she said.

But she claims he has broken his agreement and started taken the four-year-old to church without her consent.

Bethenny filed for divorce from Jason 16 months ago.

Jason had 
reportedly been hoping to come to an out-of-court deal with his 
estranged wife, who sold her Skinnygirl alcohol brand to Beam Global for
 an estimated $39m with a similar amount promised if the brand hit 
certain sales targets.

A source told People, 'She wanted to settle out of court but some of his demands were absolutely insane that no mother would ever agree.'

Bethenny and Jason are due back in court on June 11.

In June 2010, the celebrity starred in the Bravo reality TV show Bethenny Getting Married, which documented her engagement to Jason, their marriage on March 28, 2010, and the birth of their daughter two months later.

The brunette, whose show Bethenny was cancelled by Fox after just one season, is finding solace in the arms of her new beau, Michael Cerrusi.

She has been dating the beefy 34-year-old son of a prominent New York attorney since the beginning of the year.
