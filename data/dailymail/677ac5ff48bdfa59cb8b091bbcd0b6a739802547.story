The Pakistani Government led by Mamnoon Hussain, dismissed the reports as 'mischievous and baseless'

Pakistan is ready to give nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia to counter any future threat from Iran, it was claimed last night.

BBC’s Newsnight has spoken to sources in Pakistan who told them they had been preparing for the possibility for some time.

Reporter Mark Urban said the programme understood that if a deal were to go ahead, Saudi Arabia could have the nuclear weapons operational and ready to deploy within the time it would take Iran to do the same.

The claim comes as the US and other Western powers are trying to get Iran back to the negotiating table to discuss its nuclear ambitions.

America has for some time been claiming that Iran is developing nuclear weapons – an allegation that Iran denies.

Iran’s alleged ambitions have worried its enemy Saudi Arabia so much, it is feared that the oil-rich state is now preparing to obtain its own nuclear deterrent, raising the possibility of a Middle East arms race.

Newsnight said its sources had told reporters that Pakistan had left a ‘certain number of warheads’ available, if the Saudis asked for them, which could ‘immediately be delivered’.

The development has the potential to derail US diplomatic attempts to bring peace to the region.

Relations between the US and Iran have been cold since the revolution in 1979, but were given hope with the election of moderate leader Hassan Rouhani earlier this year.

Mr Rouhani shared a phone call with President Obama in late September, the first time leaders of the two countries had spoken for more than 30 years.

Saudi Arabia acquiring nuclear weapons would make it less likely that Iran would abandon any weapons programme it may have.

Though relations have been fraught between the US and Iran, the election of moderate leader Hassan Rouhani earlier this year breathed new hope into the situation

Failure to get Iran round the table will also make it harder to get the Israelis, who see Iran as their biggest threat, to agree to downsize their own nuclear weapons capability.

Last night the Pakistani and Saudi governments released statements in response to the Newsnight claims.

Pakistan described the programme’s assertions as ‘secular, mischievous and baseless’. Saudi Arabia pointed out that it was a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 

It added that its determination to keep the Middle East non-nuclear was one of the  reasons it recently refused to take a seat on the United Nations Security Council.
