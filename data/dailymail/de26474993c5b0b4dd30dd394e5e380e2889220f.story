A lorry driver has been jailed for seven years for killing his friend who asked him to test out his new 'bulletproof' vest - with a shotgun.

Ian Catley, 40, and close friend Philip Harper were in a farmer's field near Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, when he fired at his chest from less than 20ft away and killed him almost instantly.

A court heard today that Mr Harper had visited a military surplus store the previous day and was 'very keen' to test the effectiveness of his new kit.

Prosecutor Martin Mulgrew described it as a 'protective' vest, although the victim believed it to be bullet-proof.

Southwark Crown Court was told that after leaving Rugby Trading International Ltd in Warwickshire he went to the pub the following evening - June 29 last year - wearing the vest and a SWAT cap.

He had already asked another friend - James Hill - to help him test it out but he had flatly refused and then asked more people when he got to the pub.

Prosecutor Mr Mulgrew said that the vest - far from being bulletproof - had a plastic casing that actually funnelled the shotgun spray into the centre of Mr Harper's chest, slicing an artery. 

He added that Mr Catley attempted to save his friend: 'He was panicking, upset and swearing.

When Catley fired his shotgun (file image) at Mr Harper from less than 20ft away, the shotgun spray was funnelled into the centre of his chest, slicing an artery. Paramedics were called but he died almost instantly

'But it was clear to the paramedics at first sight that there was very little that could be done to save Mr Harper's life.'

He said Catley had first claimed he had been aiming for a pigeon and hit his friend by accident, but quickly came clean.

Defence barrister Mark McDonald argued that the killing was the result of a stupid and reckless act to which the 'keen' Mr Harper had nevertheless consented. 

'(Mr Harper) was very proud of it. He'd gone to the pub that evening wearing that vest and indeed a SWAT cap,' Mr McDonald said.

'After a drink or so, he asked more people, and Mr Catley agreed to do a stupid and undoubtedly reckless act.' 

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter last November and appeared in the dock today for sentencing. 

Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, handing down the sentence, said: 'You shot Mr Harper at a distance of less than 20 feet, causing him catastrophic injuries and immediate death.

'You then, straight away, took him to hospital but tragically, nothing could be done to save his life.'

Catley stared straight ahead in the dock as the sentence came down, while his mother appeared to fight back tears from the public gallery.

The court heard the two friends had been close and Catley had nightmares about what he had done. 

'Your remorse is complete and genuine,' the judge said. 'You recognise the magnitude of your actions and I have no doubt that the effects of killing your good friend will last with you for the rest of your life.'

But he said Catley, as a gun licence-holder, had 'manifestly breached those obligations and duties'.  

Catley will serve up to half his seven-year term, and the judge ordered that his gun be forfeited and destroyed.
