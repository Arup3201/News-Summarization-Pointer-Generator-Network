Texas and 23 other states trying to block President Barack Obama's recently announced immigration orders are holding up the costs of providing unemployment insurance, education, health care, driver's licenses and other programs to illegals as evidence that the directives will cause them 'irreparable damage' if allowed to take effect.

The states made the case in a filing submitted to a Texas court ahead of a hearing on Thursday at which they hope to obtain a preliminary injunction barring the Obama administration from proceeding with its plans to give more than 4 million illegal immigrants work permits. 

Wisconsin is also claiming that illegal immigrants residing in The Badger State will be able to get concealed carry permits as a result of Obama's unilateral action.

States say that President Barack Obama's immigration directives will cost untold millions, and they are trying to get them blocked through the courts

'States will have to pay millions of dollars to remediate the problems created by the Directive,' the brief states. 'It will be difficult or impossible to recover those costs from the federal government.'

Driver's licenses alone will cost millions, states participating in the legal challenge argued.

Using Texas' population of 1.6 million illegal immigrants as an example, the brief claims that the state would face a net loss of $174.73 per license if a third of its immigrant population sought IDs.

If just two percent applied, it would still cost Texas taxpayers close to $131 per license.

In just the last two years Texas says it has spent $1.313 billion on administering medical care to illegal immigrants and $303 million in Emergency Medicaid money.

The costs of educating illegal immigrant children in Texas are nearly $9,500 a pupil, annually, the briefing asserted. 

'Texas is not unique,' it goes on to explain.

Also listed as plaintiffs in the Texas suit are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. 

Separately, Wisconsin is claiming that Obama's executive order will allow otherwise qualified illegal immigrants to apply for concealed carry permits for handguns. 

'The cost to the state are immense,' Wisconsin's then-Attorney General, J.B. Van Hollen, said last month during an appearance on Fox News host Neil Cavuto's show.

'We have certain things that under this law we have from provide to these four to five million national illegal immigrants such as drivers licenses, they will get Social Security Numbers, the ability to get work permits, they will get unemployment benefits,' he claimed.

In addition, Van Hollen, who exited office last week, said, 'very importantly in Wisconsin, where we have permits for concealed carry of firearms, they are going to be able to lawfully carry firearms when they are not even lawfully in the country.' 

A spokeswoman for the AG's office confirmed to MailOnline at the time of the appearance that illegal immigrants who meet the requirements for concealed carry will be able to apply for permits in Wisconsin..

But one of the documents applicants must provide is a proper license for the gun, and an undated copy of Department of Justice guidelines once posted to the agency's website and obtained by DailyMail.com states that its a crime for illegal residents to have guns, let alone purchase them.

DOJ has not returned DailyMail.com's requests for confirmation that the policies outlined in the document are still in effect. 

However, Second Amendment Foundation founder and firearms expert Alan Gottlieb told DailyMail.com that illegal immigrants are still barred from buying or owning guns in the U.S., contrary to Wisconsin's claims.

Former Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, left, shakes hands with newly inaugurated Attorney General Brad Schimel at the state Capitol on Monday, Jan. 5,  in Madison, Wisconsin. Van Hollen has argued that illegal immigrants will be eligible for concealed carry permits under Wisconsin law but that may not be true

The president announced his immigration measures in late November, but they will not take effect until this spring, giving Republican politicians at both the state and federal levels ample time to challenge the directives before the Department of Homeland Security begins issuing work permits.

In addition to the state-based strategy to undo the immigration orders, lawmakers opposed to Obama's executive actions are looking to link appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the fiscal year to legislation barring funds from being spent on immigration services they believe are unlawful.

Congress passed, and the president signed, a large spending bill in December that allotted money to every area of the government but DHS through the end of September. Appropriations for the department will run out on Feb. 28 unless Congress acts.  

The House of Representatives is considering legislation this week that would effectively cut off funding for Obama's directives and stop DHS agencies from spending the money they collect from fees on those immigration services while approving the bulk of the department's budget. 

The White House said Monday that it would veto any legislation that tampers with the president's executive order.

'There's never a good time for Republicans to do something like this, but right now it seems like a particularly bad time to do so,' the president's spokesman said.

If the White House and Republicans can't agree on a compromise before the end of next month, DHS will go into a partial shutdown and non-essential staffers will be put on unpaid leave until the the legislative and executive branches resolve the situation.

House and Senate GOP leaders have said they won't let that happen, though.
