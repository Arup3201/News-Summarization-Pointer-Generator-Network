Senior government figure Senator Eric Abetz stumbled over his answer when asked to name the ways Prime Minister Tony Abbott has changed.

After surviving a vote on a leadership spill earlier this month, Mr Abbott said: 'I've listened, I've learnt and I've changed and the government will change with me.'

On Monday during Senate Estimates, Labor Senate leader Penny Wong asked Senator Abetz to list the ways the Prime Minister is now different.

Senior government figure Senator Eric Abetz stumbled over his answer when asked to name the ways Prime Minister Tony Abbott has changed

After surviving a vote on a leadership spill earlier this month, Mr Abbott said: 'I've listened, I've learnt and I've changed and the government will change with me.'

'Look the Prime Minister is an exceptionally capable and good individual and sometimes the good even gets better, and that is what the Prime Minister has committed himself to doing—to be, as he said publicly, more consultative with the backbench and with the community,' Senator Abetz replied.

Senator Wong then asked: 'And so is the "I've changed" being more consultative with the backbench and the community?'

Senator Abetz replied: 'Oh, amongst many other things I'm sure.'

Senator Wong pressed the Leader of the Government in the Senate to list them.

'What are the other things?' she asked.

Senator Abetz said he would answer at a later date.

On Monday, Penny Wong pressed Senator Abetz to list more than one way in which the PM is different

'I will take that on notice and I'm sure we'll be able to provide you with a detailed list,' he said.

This prompted Senator Wong to ask: 'You need to take on notice how the Prime Minister's changed?'

He replied: 'Well there are so many good things to talk about, Senator, that it's very hard to recall them all immediately.'

This comes as the latest Newspoll one-third of people believe Mr Abbott is out of touch with voters, but support for the Coalition has risen to a four-month high.

Support for the Coalition rose three points, while Labor fell three points, the poll published by News Corp showed.

He said: 'I will take that on notice and I'm sure we'll be able to provide you with a detailed list'

Both parties were tied on a primary vote of 38 per cent.

In two-party terms, the Coalition made its single largest fortnightly gain in its 18 months in power, rising to 47 per cent.

The opposition however remains in a commanding two-party-preferred position of 53 per cent. The Greens were unchanged at 12 per cent.

The latest poll also showed 77 per cent of those surveyed consider Mr Abbott arrogant, and only one-third of them believe he is in touch with voters.

Voters continued to rank opposition leader Bill Shorten as a better prime minister, by 43 per cent to 35 per cent.
