A teacher in a small Canadian town has given thousands of former students good cause to remember him later in life when they unexpectedly receive letters handwritten by themselves 20 years previously.

Bruce Farrer, 72, began his career as a high school English teacher in Fort Qu’Appelle, a town of about 2,000 people in Saskatchewan, in 1961.

Not long after he came up with the idea of getting his high school freshmen pupils to write a 10-page letters to their future selves, to be read by their eyes only when they reached adulthood.

Farrer, who spent much of his career at Bert Fox Community High School, started to exercise simply because he wanted to encourage his students to write.

‘I was trying to think of some assignment that would be special, and it just sort of came up,’ he recently told the National Post.

By the time he retired in 2002 Farrer had amassed five bins worth of letters waiting to be returned to their authors.

Every year Farrer sets about his task of tracking down his old pupils and this year it was the turn of the class of 1994.

Among those who took a trip down memory lane when they opened their mailboxes last week was Scott Fulton, who is now a teacher himself.

He remembered doing the assignment, but not what he wrote.

‘It kind of faded from my memory,’ he told CBS News. ‘To receive it again was pretty special.’

‘So, anyway, are you married?’  his 14-year-old self asked. ‘To who? I've always wondered if I would get married to somebody I already know now or somebody I'll meet later on in my life ... Did you got to university? Which one?’

Fulton doesn’t currently have a wife or kids and decided to become a teacher, rather than do sports medicine, as his teenage self had planned.

DJ Anardi has two children with Erin who he had a crush on at school 20 years ago, while Scott Fulton, who opened his 20-year-old letter this week is now a teacher himself

Another former pupil who received his letter this year is DJ Anardi. ‘Hey you good-looking guy, how is your life?’ his 15-year-old self had written.

Back in high school Anardi had wanted to go to college and play football, but instead he works at a steel mill.

He was dating another girl when he put pen to paper in the early 1990s, but had a crush on a girl named Erin. Today, Erin is his wife and the mother of his two boys. In his letter he’d written that he wanted three or four children.

‘I hope other teachers do it,’ he said.

Farrer says not all his ex-students are so happy to receive their letters: ‘I think some of them are embarrassed by how immature they were, but when you’re 14, you’re immature.’

One particular student was obsessed with ABBA and dreamed of marrying a 'beautiful blond Swede' now lives in Sweden with his Swedish wife

‘And some of them don’t want to show it to their spouses or their parents,’ he said.

Some letters have unearthed amazing stories. One particular student was ‘obsessed with ABBA and dreamed of marrying a “beautiful blond Swede,”’ said Farrer.

‘Twenty years later, the young man had moved to Sweden and done just that.’

The retired teacher has spent countless hours tracking down students who’ve long grown up, moved away from home and married.

Farrer does his best to use his network of former students, along with social media and good old-fashioned detective work to get the letters back to their authors.

Sadly some students have passed away before they could read the words they wrote as teens, with suicide, car accidents, and illness claiming their lives.

When students originally turned in the letters, they let Farrar know if he was allowed to read them or not. In the case of deceased students he reads them regardless, mostly to decide whether sharing them with their families would be comforting or painful.

By and large it’s a happy process for Farrer, and he’s delighted to see how things have worked out for his students.
