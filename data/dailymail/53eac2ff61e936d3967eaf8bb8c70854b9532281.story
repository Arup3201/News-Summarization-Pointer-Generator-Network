Vincent Kompany is the only possible survivor from the Man City starting line up the last time these two sides met in April 2010.

There have been 37 goals scored in the last seven meetings between Man City and Burnley, with the last four seeing at least six goals scored in each.

Manchester City have won eight and lost none of the last 12 meetings in all competitions with the Clarets.

Yaya Toure has netted in each of the last three Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium.

Man City have won 23 and lost just two of their 27 Premier League home games under Manuel Pellegrini.

Under the Chilean’s stewardship, City have conceded just 18 goals in 27 home matches in the Premier League.

Burnley have picked up just nine points from a possible 81 available away from home in their two stints in the Premier League.

The Clarets have kept just one clean sheet in 27 Premier League away games and conceded at least two goals in 21 of those matches.

Burnley have played seven Premier League North West derbies away from home in their two seasons in the Premier League, losing six. However, the one point they earned was in a 3-3 draw at the Etihad Stadium.

After winning none of their first five Premier League matches at the Etihad between Christmas and New Year (D4 L1), City have won the last five in a row.
