History remembers brilliant men who developed the atomic bomb that forced the surrender of Japan and won the Second World War.

But, history seems to have forgotten the women of Atomic City. Without them, no atomic weapon would have been possible. 

Tens of thousands of young women from across the nation - white and black, college educated and high school dropouts, wealthy and poor - moved to a muddy boom town in the Appalachian Mountains in 1942 to work on the top-secret project of refining and enriching uranium.

None of them knew exactly what was happening at Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They were purposely kept in the dark about the nature of their work. They only knew that it was something that would help win the war.

Shift change: These are the women who worked at the Y-12 plant, which used electromagnets to separate Uranium-235 from natural uranium ore

Anything you can do: Women performed a wide variety of tasks that were previously done only by men. Here, a woman fits pipe into a valve with a welding torch

Empowering: Women from poor and rural areas of the South and Midwest found good-paying jobs in Atomic City

Author Denise Kiernan offers the first comprehensive history of these pioneering workers of the Manhattan Project in her new book, 'The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Help Win World War II.' It is published by Touchstone Books.

For most women, Atomic City was empowering. Inspired by images of Rosie the Riveter and a shortage of men on the home-front, they were given jobs in hard labor, as well as math and science.

They wielded blow torches and Geiger counters and were taught skills that would have been nearly unimaginable before the war.

Atomic City was a boom town unlike any seen before. In 1942 there were 3,000 residents living in the mountainside hollers and woods. By 1945, more than 75,000 workers toiled day and night. 

Top secret: Signs around the compound warned workers not to talk about what they hear and saw at the nuclear facility

Separate and unequal: Black women were also recruited to work in the plant, though they were forced to live in huts and were not allowed to live with their spouses or bring their children - unlike white women

Atomic age: Women worked in the same labs and factories as men - often doing many of the same jobs. Here is the exterior of one of those plants

Shops and bunk houses, homes and roads sprang out of the Tennessee clay mud. By war's end, the town had one of the largest bus systems in the nation - ferrying workers to their top-secret jobs. But it wasn't on any map,

Kiernan tells the story of the secret city through the eyes of nine living Atomic City girls who watched the town grow and unfold in front of them. 

Celia Szapka was a Polish Catholic girl who fled a coal mining town in Pennsylvania in search of good work. She rose to become a personal secretary for some of the top leaders of Oak Ridge.

Kattie Strickland left her three children in Alabama so she could make money to send home. Katie and her husband were not allowed to live together because they were black. And her black babies were not welcome on the compound either.

Jane Greer is the daughter of a wealthy Tennessee businessman who, when she tried to apply for an engineering degree at the University of Tennessee, was told that the school 'did not matriculate girls for engineering.'

She studied statistics instead and eventually led a team of women who tracked uranium production.

'It was the others, the great and often unseen, who made the theories of scientists a reality,' Kiernan writes.

'Tens of thousands of individuals - some still reeling from the Depression, others gripped by anxiety and fear as loved ones fought overseas in the most devastating war any of them had known - worked around the clock on this project, the details of which were not explained.'

Despite the empowerment and the high-paying jobs, the women couldn't entirely break out of the 1940s gender roles.

The leaders of the base were all men and men called all of the shots.

Toni Peters, whose family was kicked off a farm in Oak Ride they had owned for generations to make way for the new facility, remembers being barked at by her 'big 'ole Yankee' boss when she first approached the base for a job.

When she tried to take dictation from him, she recalls, she 'couldn't understand who words he said.' Her dictation pad included numerous blank words as she tried to understand his northern dialect.

When the boss realized this, he admitted that he could hardly understand her, either. Peters got the job anyway.

Secrecy was most important. Signs like 'What you see here, what you do here, what you hear here, when you leave here - LET IT STAY HERE' dotted the compound.

Workers were forbidden from speaking about what work they did. Instead, the common question was 'Where are you from?'

Indeed, it was not until August 1945 - after the atomic bomb Little Boy 
was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, killing 166,000 - that the workers 
found out what their efforts had made possible.

When she found out, Peters remembers exclaiming: 'It's a bomb!'

Home comforts: It wasn't just nuclear physics being done at Oak Ridge. Here the women are pictured during a home economics class

Boom town: The military built Atomic City from the ground up. In 1942 is was home to 3,000 rural farmers. By 1945, more than 75,000 worked in the factories

Lethal: Few people working on the project knew that they were enriching uranium to create Little Boy, the first atom bomb used in war
