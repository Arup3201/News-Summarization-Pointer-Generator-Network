An Olympics spectator who hurled a beer bottle at the start of the men’s 100m final got into the stadium without a valid ticket, a court heard yesterday.

Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, evaded layers of tight security designed to prevent a terror attack to reach exclusive seats close to the start line, it was said.

He is believed to have used an old ticket to trick officials into letting him enter the Olympic Park and the stadium, where he was able to reach the £4,000 seats without being stopped.

Moments before the start of the blue riband event of the Olympics, he screamed abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, then hurled a green Heineken bottle towards the athletes as they sprinted out of the blocks.

Father-of-two Gill-Webb, from South Milford near Leeds, later admitted throwing the bottle, but claimed he ‘was in the grips of a manic episode’ when he did so.

When police initially arrested him he pretended to be Scottish actor Alan Cumming, who appeared in the James Bond film Goldeneye and the X-Men films, and claimed a Dutch spectator had thrown the bottle.

Details of his bizarre behaviour emerged on the opening day of his trial at Stratford magistrates’ court, which is close to the Olympic Stadium in east London.

He later explained that he gave the name of the Scottish actor as many people say that he looks like him, the court heard.

He is accused of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress. He denies the charge.

Bolt was not distracted and went on to win the race in 9.63 seconds, the second-fastest 100m ever.

Gill-Webb, who was in the midst of the Dutch Olympic team, was confronted by judo bronze medallist Edith Bosch and restrained by volunteers before being arrested, the court was told.

In a statement read to the court, Miss Bosch described how Gill-Webb, who had ‘slurred speech’ and ‘glassy’ eyes, pushed past her to get to the front.

She said: ‘He was shouting specifically at Usain Bolt. Things like: “Usain I want you to lose. Usain you are bad. You are an a*******”.’

She said a volunteer asked Gill-Webb to return to his seat which made him angry.

Miss Bosch then saw ‘the man in front of me move his arm back behind his head and then forwards in a throwing motion. I then saw a bottle hit the track.’

As he started to move away, she confronted him.

Miss Bosch said she was 'flabbergasted' at what she had witnessed, saying: 'such behaviour is so inappropriate', and added: 'I was sad to miss the 100m.'

Miss Bosch added: ‘I was angry with what he had done which was so disrespectful.’

After the event, she wrote on Twitter: ‘A drunken spectator threw a bottle on to the track! I HAVE BEATEN HIM . . . unbelievable.’ Gill-Webb was originally due to stand trial in September, but this was abandoned after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

He admits being abusive and throwing the bottle, but claims his mental illness prevented him from understanding the effect his actions would have on others.

Dr Richard Latham, a consultant psychiatrist called by the prosecution, said Gill-Webb must have been aware what he was doing when he slipped past security into a £4,000-a-ticket area of the Olympic Stadium.

'He made the decision to go to the Olympic Park, he thought about it and made the decision to go there', he said.

Opening the case at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London yesterday, prosecutor Neil King told the court the Games had reached a highlight with the men's 100m final.

He said: 'In the stadium, along with the many thousands who should have been there legitimately and were watching the race in hushed anticipation, was also Mr Gill-Webb who, it is now accepted, was unwell at the time.

Claim: Gill-Webb allegedly told police he was the actor Alan Cummings

'His conduct at the time, however, the Crown say, was one that was causing harassment, alarm and distress to those around him, and his conduct was one that he intended to cause harassment, alarm and distress.

'He had somehow, without a ticket ever being found on him, made his way into very exclusive seats indeed.  He was mingling with members of the Dutch Olympic team.  Indeed he would be within striking distance of a bronze medallist Ms Edith Bosch.

'Whilst there he hurled abuse towards the athletes in the final, particularly towards the eventual winner Usain Bolt.'

'He threw a green Heineken bottle in a lobbing motion that was captured on CCTV. This bottle landed extremely close to the athletes and it's probably luck rather than Mr Gill-Webb's judgment that it did not do anything far more serious.'

Mr King said: 'His conduct, that is to say the shouting and jostling, had already alarmed and disrupted those around him but throwing the bottle was a step even further and led to confrontation with Ms Bosch.'

Fellow witnesses described seeing Gill-Webb shouting at the finalists, hurling insults at Bolt, fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake, and US sprinter Justin Gatlin.

Student Farzin Mirshahi said she heard him yell: 'Believe in Blake, no Usain.'

Her brother Kiya Mirshahi, also a student, said he heard Gill-Webb shout: 'Usain, no, Justin you are a druggie, believe in Blake, no Usain, no.'

He told the court: 'He was very vocal about the athletes as they competed, and kept leaving his seat and coming back again, standing in the aisles.

'At no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what I had seen, but just demanded to know who had won the race'

'He was trying to get to the front to be closer to the athetes.'

Security guard Robert Spears saw Gill-Webb jostling his way through the Dutch fans and then saw him throw a bottle towards the starting blocks.

'I feared at this point that he was going to disrupt the Games,' his statement, which was read to the court, said, and he described grabbing Gill-Webb with another member of staff and escorting him from the stadium.

'At no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what I had seen, but just demanded to know who had won the race,' Mr Spears said.

Gill-Webb's DNA was found on the bottle, and CCTV footage was due to be shown to the court of him jostling Dutch fans and athletes shortly before throwing it.

The case continues.
