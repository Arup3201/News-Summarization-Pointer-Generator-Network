It goes to show some elderly ladies can still put up a pretty decent fight.

An 83-year-old woman allegedly scratched and beat a policeman’s arm until it bled after she was pulled over for an illegal U-turn in her vehicle.

Rosella Robinson was spotted by the officer in an area of Elgin, Illinois, known for drug and gang activity, police said.

'Attack': Rosella Robinson, 83, of Elgin, Illinois, allegedly scratched and beat a policeman's arm until it bled after she was pulled over for an illegal U-turn

The incident started on Monday afternoon when she realised she was being watched and made the U-turn before driving away, police said.

Robinson allegedly tried to get away before the officer stopped her,  reached into her car and switched off the ignition.

She allegedly then grabbed the officer’s arm, scratching and beating on it until it bled as he tried to take away her keys.

The woman claimed she wanted to leave so the officer was trying to stop her driving off, reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

The elderly lady also allegedly shouted obscenities at police and even refused to sit in the car when handcuffed.

Location: The incident allegedly started on Monday on Percy Street in Elgin, Illinois, when the woman realised she was being watched by officers

Robinson was arrested, charged with battery of a police officer and resisting arrest and taken to a police station by officers.

But an emergency bond hearing was called due to her age and health so she wouldn't have to be in jail overnight, reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

She told cops at the station she needed medication for illnesses, although she could not tell them what the medicines were, police said.

Judge James Hallock came into the police station on Monday night and ordered her to be released on her own recognisance.

Robinson thanked police before a relative drove her home, reported TribLocal. She will be in court for a hearing next month

The incident happened on Percy Street in South Elgin and Robinson lives around five miles away on Manchester Court.
