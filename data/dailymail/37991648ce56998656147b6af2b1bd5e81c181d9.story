Parking your car is usually considered an annoying yet necessary chore, but these stunning structures are re-inventing the wheel.

From the world's most famous parking garage - the Autostadt in Germany - to the haunting, gothic beauty of the converted Michigan Theatre in Detroit, eco-friendly, aesthetically-pleasing car parks are a growing trend.

Adjacent to the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, the Autostadt is an entire car community, complete with an office, museum and production space. But it's pièce de résistance? The twin 60m car park towers made entirely of glass and steel, also known as the final stop for cars from the factory.

For a more art deco feel, try the avant garde 1111 Lincoln Road parking garage in South Beach, Miami. Designed by Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron, the open air structure - which is said to resemble a 'house of cards' - also boasts a fashion boutique on its fifth floor, a seventh floor event space, and a penthouse apartment, pool and gardens.

In the UK, head to either South Yorkshire or Birmingham for a glimpse at British-made architectural marvels. Q Park Charles Street in Sheffield has been dubbed the 'Cheesegrater' thanks to its cubed exterior, while the Millennium Point car park, in Birmingham, designed by architect Mark Sloane at Acivico Ltd, glows blue at night thanks to its impressive paneling.

And for those particularly into trend-setting design, go Down Under to Melbourne, Australia, for a glimpse of the city's Eureka Tower car park. The tallest building in the city not only offers nine storeys of parking, but also has a painted interior with lettering that appears to 'jump out' of its surroundings.
