The Essex accent has long attracted ridicule and disapproval.

But primary school teachers say it also has a damaging effect on children’s spelling and grammar.So they have introduced elocution lessons in an effort to improve pupils’ written work.

The children are learning to say ‘computer’ instead of ‘computa’ and ‘aren’t’ in place of ‘ain’t’ as well as being told to stop ending sentences with ‘yeah?’.

Plumb in the mouth: Cherry Tree Primary School in Basildon is one of the first in the country to offer its pupils elocution lessons. Pictured are pupils Lucy Stapleton and Callum Cowan being taught by Francesca Gordon-Smith

Up to 200 seven to 11-year-olds  are having weekly lessons with a private tutor at the Cherry Tree Primary School in Basildon, Essex.

Teachers say there has been great progress in their spelling and writing since the lessons were introduced a year ago. Some parents are even being corrected on their pronunciation at home by their children.

The spotlight has been turned on the Essex accent following the huge success of the reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

Terri Chudleigh, the school’s literacy co-ordinator, insisted: ‘This is not about being ashamed of the Essex accent – it’s about helping the children to speak properly so they can improve their reading and writing.

'They weren’t saying words correctly and were therefore misspelling them.

‘We had lots of youngsters writing ‘sbort’ instead of ‘sport’ and ‘wellw’ instead of ‘well’.

'They now have half-hourly sessions where they get taken through exercises and learn to use the "posh voices" in their heads.

'They really enjoy the sessions. The feedback we’ve had from parents has been very positive. We’ve had them tell us their children are going home and correcting them on their speech!'

Former TOWIE star Maria Fowler said of the concept: 'I think elocution lessons in schools are a good idea.

'Even if they're not a priority across the whole country,  it's good to see this school doing this.'

However, Billie Faiers, who currently appears in the show, today criticised the school for introducing the lessons.

She said: ‘I think it is ridiculous that kids so young are being forced to act a certain way.

'Both me and my sister have never had any sort of elocution lessons and it did not do us any harm.

'I worked at a recruitment agency before TOWIE and my sister worked in a bank and neither of us had any problems with our regional accent.

'I think kids should be kids, and let creative ideas come from individuality. If everybody spoke in the same way, we'd soon all get bored of speaking like one another.'

During the sessions, children run through speech exercises and are encouraged to use ‘posh voices’.

Francesca Gordon-Smith, who runs the classes through her business Positive Voice, said: ‘When they’re writing, the children have their elocution voice in their head.

Speaking clearly: Teachers at the school say they have seen a vast improvement in their pupils' spelling and writing since the lessons were introduced

Extra lessons: Rising numbers of schools are teaching elocution. At Cherry Tree Primary School in Essex, 11-year-olds are having weekly lessons with a private tutor (pictured)

‘They speak clearer, they’re pronouncing their Ts and generally finishing sentences.’

The classes have also improved pupils’ grammar, for example by telling them to use ‘we were’ instead of ‘we was’.

Rising numbers of all ages from all over Britain are turning to elocution, according to research by the thetutorpages.com website.
