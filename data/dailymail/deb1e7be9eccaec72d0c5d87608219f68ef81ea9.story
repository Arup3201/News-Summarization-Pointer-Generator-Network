A Detroit television news reporter dropped a big bomb during a live video feed Wednesday when she used the ‘f-word’ on camera.

WDIV’s Lauren Podell had the verbal slip up just moments after anchors in the studio handed things over for coverage of a large fire in downtown Lapeer, Michigan this morning.

‘I don't know when we're going, neither does Jim, I can't get this f***ing in there!’ Podell said from someplace off camera.

Oops: Detroit TV news reporter Lauren Podell dropped an f-bomb during a live feed Wednesday

Unfortunately for Podell, they were going--live on the air, that is--that very moment.

The anchors in the studio were confused, too, but only at first.

After briefly nodding in mock understanding at what ended up being the start of Podell’s brief rant, cameras cut back to the studio.

Quick-thinking anchor Evrod Cassimy quickly apologized.

But that wasn’t necessary for all WDIV’s viewers.

‘Still love you!!!’ wrote Facebook user Angela Boston-Wallace. ‘Just not everyone is on live television when they slip.’

Podell has been a reporter at the Detroit NBC affiliate since 2007, when she started covering traffic.

At the beginning of 2013, Podell was brought onto the morning news team as a general assignment reporter.
