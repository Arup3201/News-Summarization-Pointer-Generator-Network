Diego Costa appears to be over his latest hamstring injury as Chelsea's Spanish striker practiced his basketball skills before Thursday's training session. 

Jose Mourinho has been reluctant to play Costa on regular basis after he was forced to pull out of Spain's squad at the beginning of September. 

However the 25-year-old's hamstrings looked in good health when he was shooting for a different kind of sports net.

Costa played the full 90 minutes of Chelsea's Champions League clash against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday and is likely to be included in Jose Mourinho's starting line-up to face Arsenal on Sunday.

The former Atletico Madrid striker has been named the PFA Fan Player of the Month for September after taking the Premier League by storm since his £32million move.

Costa has scored eight league goals in six games for the Blues so far this season.
