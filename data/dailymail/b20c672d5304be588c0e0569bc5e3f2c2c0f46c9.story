The man behind the horrific shooting massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple last year was becoming increasingly more radicalized with the help of the internet, newly unsealed documents have revealed.

The warrant doesn't say what Page was viewing, but that it disturbed his girlfriend, Misty Cook, who told authorities that Page pushed her to join a white power group in Chicago known as Crew 38.

She told federal authorities that Page was an 'alcoholic skinhead,' according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Citing documents, the paper reported that Page was typical of others who use the internet to become increasingly radical.

The warrants reads: 'FBI experts believe the Internet continues to serve as the primary radicalization instrument, used to recruit teenagers and young adults into the radical skinhead movement.'

Cook, who is from Milwaukee, was arrested after a gun 
was found at her home.

She and Page were said to have broken up shortly 
before the Wisconsin massacre.

Page stormed into the temple on August 5, 2012, killing four people inside and two others outside.

Four others were injured - including  Oak Creek police Lt Brian Murphy - the first officer to arrive at the scene. Lt Murphy was shot 17 times, according to reports.

Page himself was wounded as he was shot in the stomach by a second police officer, Officer Sam
Lenda. Page then shot himself in the head.

The FBI eventually concluded Page - a former member of the U.S. military - acted alone in the shooting rampage. A motive has never been established.

Page was said to have harbored white supremacist views and would often rant 
about a 'racial holy war,' an former Army buddy told CNN two days after the shooting.

Christopher Robillard told the network that Page was his 'closest friend' in the military, 
but that even then he had troubling political beliefs.

The future killer was 'a very kind, 
very smart individual' who 'loved his friends', according to Mr 
Robillard, who added that Page was 'one of those guys with a soft spot.'

But Mr Robillard said that his friend
was 'involved with white supremacy,' and continued: 'He would talk 
about the racial holy war, like he wanted it to come.

'But to me, he didn't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people.

'I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention.'

Mr Robillard said that Page was kicked out of the military after showing up for a line-up while drunk.
