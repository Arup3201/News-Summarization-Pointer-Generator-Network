Rescued: Hannah Luce, 22, daughter of Teen Mania founder Ron Luce, is the lone survivor on a plane that crashed in southeast Kansas on Friday, killing four others

Ron Luce didn't recognize the voice of the woman who phoned Friday to say his daughter Hannah was with her, and was fine.

Her words didn't make any sense to the Texas minister and founder of a 
Christian organization that reaches out to troubled youths. How could 
Hannah be with this woman when she was on a plane, headed to a Christian
youth rally in Iowa?

'The way I discovered about my daughter and the plane accident was 
probably the most unscripted way you could imagine,' Mr Luce said Sunday 
during a news conference at University of Kansas Hospital, where his 
22-year-old daughter was in serious condition with burns over 28 percent
of her body.

'I asked (the woman), "Where's the plane?" She said it's off in the distance, and there are flames, there's smoke.'

Hannah Luce is the only one of five people who survived when a 
twin-engine Cessna 401 crashed Friday afternoon northwest of Chanute.

Three died at the scene, and a fourth, a former Marine and recent university graduate who Mr Luce said helped his daughter
walk from the wreckage to a nearby road, died early Saturday morning at
a hospital in Wichita.

All five were on their way from Tulsa, Okla., to an Acquire the Fire 
rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa. It was the last of 33 such events this 
year held across the U.S. by Teen Mania Ministries, which Mr Luce said he 
created 25 years ago to reach out to troubled youths. The ministry is 
based in Garden Valley, Texas, where the Luce family lives.

Hero: Former Marine Austin Anderson, 27, who graduated from ORU last week, died from his injuries Saturday after helping Ms Luce escape the burning plane to a road for help

'There could be no prouder parents than the parents of the four remarkable young men who were killed,' Mr Luce said.

The Kansas Highway Patrol identified the victims as pilot Luke Sheets, 
23, of Ephraim, Wis.; Austin Anderson, 27, of Ringwood, Okla.; Garrett 
Coble, 29, of Tulsa, Okla.; and Stephen Luth, 22, of Muscatine, Iowa.

Mr Anderson, a former Marine, had served two tours of duty in Iraq 
before going to Oral Roberts University.

He and Mr Luth had recently been 
hired to the Teen Mania marketing staff.

According to Mr Coble's Facebook profile, who was an assistant professor at Northeastern State University, he was recently engaged to be married this year.

On board: Stephen Luth, 22, (left) and Luke Sheets, 23, who was piloting the plane when it went down Friday, were both ORU graduates who died in the crash

Pilot: Mr Sheets was the son of a former Air Force pilot who now flies commercial jets

A friend of Mr Anderson's, Aubrey
Crawford, said that Mr Coble's fiancee Elizabeth was suppose to fly with them 
to the event in Iowa but backed out at the last minute. Her father told 
her he had a 'bad feeling,' prompting her to drive instead, she told News9.com.

Mr Luce said Mr Anderson suffered burns over 90 percent of his body and was 
next to Hannah Luce when she asked the woman to make the call.

'He got out, but he went to get Hannah out as well and that's how his lungs got burned,' Ms Crawford said.

Mr Anderson 
was taken to a Wichita hospital, where he died around 5 am Saturday.

Mr Luce said he asked his daughter about reports that Mr Anderson had pulled 
her from the wreckage, but 'she just began to tear up' and didn't 
respond.

'I know Austin, he's that kind of guy,' Mr Luce said. 'He served two tours 
in Iraq, and he was willing to give his life for his country. He was 
willing to give his life for a friend. He was always willing to go that 
extra mile.'

Hannah Luce graduated from Oral Roberts last year with a theology degree
and was working on her master's degree in counseling psychology at 
Oklahoma State University, Mr Luce said.

She was scheduled to start undergoing skin grafts Monday, he said, and 
was expected to remain in the Kansas City, Kan., hospital for two to 
three weeks.

Engaged: Garrett Coble, 29, a recently engaged assistant professor at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, was also among the fatalities

Bad feeling: Mr Coble's fiancee, pictured beside him, narrowly flew with him Friday but chose to drive after her father told her he had a bad feeling about it

Mr Coble, a professor at Northeastern State University in Broken Arrow, 
Okla., was a longtime friend of Teen Mania and had served with the group
on 15 mission trips, Mr Luce said.

Mr Sheets, who was flying the plane, was the son of a former Air Force pilot who now flies commercial jets.

'He had flown with his dad all of his life,' Mr Luce said. 'He had been 
trained and checked out on this plane. He had flown this plane a number 
of times, and was very well-versed on it.'

According to Tulsa World, he would often spend his Friday afternoon's flying medical support flights.

'He was just a wonderful young man, 
God-fearing man, it's a terrible loss,' said Bill Austin, a Tennessee 
plane dealer speaking to Fox23.

Crash: The plane (left) skidded 200 feet through a field before colliding with a line of trees and catching fire, killing three of its five passengers Friday evening

Flight path: The group was flying from Oklahoma to the Acquire the Fire Christian youth rally in Iowa when their plane went down

Investigation: The crash of the twin-engine Cessna 401, a similar model shown, is currently under investigation by the National Transportation Security Board

He
said he sold the Cessna the group was flying in a few weeks ago to an 
undisclosed buyer, but noted it not having any prior problems to his 
knowledge.

Mr Luce said 130,000 to 140,000 youths each year attend Acquire the Fire 
rallies across the country, and more than 3 million had participated in 
Teen Mania events since its inception.

According to National Transportation 
Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson, the eight-seat plane from Tulsa 
lost contact with air traffic control shortly after getting permission 
to descend to a lower altitude.

The plane then skidded 200ft, according to Fox23, colliding with a line of trees before spinning 180 degrees and catching fire.

The NTSB is currently investigating the cause of the crash.

Recovery: Ms Luce, pictured right, is currently in serious condition with burns over 28 percent of her body

Studies: She graduated from Oral Roberts last year with a theology degree and was working on her master's degree in counseling psychology at Oklahoma State University

Recovery: Ms Luce is scheduled to start undergoing skin grafts on Monday and expected to remain in the Kansas City hospital for two to three weeks

Brooke Ninowski, a fellow ORU graduate and friend of Mr Anderson said
they had been friends for about two years - he was her brother's 
roommate for a semester - and had interviewed him for a video profile 
after his return from Iraq. She 
said they also had a few classes together.

Ms Ninowski said she also knew Mr Luth and Mr Sheets through school, noting that Mr Luth had dated one of her best friends.

'They were guys who stuck to their 
morals and it showed through their character, and how they treated 
people,' she said. 'They thought of others first.

'I don't know if the 
reports are true about Austin, that he might have pulled Hannah out of 
the wreckage, but that wouldn't surprise me in any way.'

'Please pray that God surrounds the 
families of Austin, Stephen, Luke and Garrett with His love and peace in
this extremely difficult time,' a statement by Teen Mania Ministries 
read Saturday.
