Paul McCartney made his first visit to Elvis Presley's grave and left one of his guitar picks behind.

According to the official Twitter account of the former Beatle, McCartney said the pick was 'so Elvis can play in heaven'.

The lifelong Elvis fan toured Graceland mansion Sunday.

McCartney was in Memphis to play a show on the North American leg of his 'Out There' tour, which has seen him perform in Brazil, Poland, Italy and Austria before drawing to a close in Seattle in July.

His set lists have included rarely performed songs such as Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite, All Together Now and Eight Days A Week, which he played live only once before the tour began, with The Beatles in 1965.

The two music monoliths actually met in 1965 in LA at a top secret location after a music journalist with links to both the Beatles and Elvis organised it.

When the Fab Four were ushered before The King they were so overawed that at first none of them could think of anything to say.

It was Elvis who broke the ice. 
‘Well, if you guys are just gonna sit there and stare at me all night, 
I’m going to bed,’ he said, before calling for guitars to be passed 
around for a jam session.

Elvis was a huge influence on both McCartney and John Lennon.
The emergence of Elvis’s first British single Heartbreak Hotel in 1956 
had led the schoolboy Lennon to form his own group, the Quarrymen.

McCartney
had been similarly obsessed, and all through their years playing in 
Liverpool’s Cavern Club and in Hamburg, The Beatles had included more 
than a dozen Elvis songs in their repertoire.
