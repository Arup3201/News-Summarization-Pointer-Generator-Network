Rolf Harris faced a flood of fresh abuse allegations yesterday as his victims vowed to reduce him to ruin by launching claims on his £11million fortune.

A dozen new alleged victims have contacted lawyers seeking compensation payouts which could top £70,000 each, with a High Court civil claim set to be launched in weeks which will effectively freeze the disgraced entertainer’s assets.

Harris, 84, faces being stripped of his fortune and honours, while galleries, schools and even a zoo scrambled to remove all trace of the paintings and plaques which once celebrated his life’s work.

Compensation: Rolf Harris' £11million fortune would be inherited by his daughter Bindi, right after his conviction yesterday, but 'up to a dozen' women have already contacted a law firm to apply for payouts

Harris was convicted on Monday of 12 counts of indecent assault on victims as young as seven after a jury refused to believe his protestations of innocence during the eight-week trial.

The court heard that Harris, who faces jail on Friday, was a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ predator who targeted youngsters and thought he was ‘above the law’.

Yesterday it also emerged that:

He is staying in the multi-million pound house, which backs on to the Thames, with wife Alwen, 82, as he awaits Friday’s sentencing.

Yesterday plaques honouring the paedophile were torn down at Colchester Zoo in Essex where Harris opened a £1million elephant enclosure in 1997. Paintings were also removed from schools and galleries in Australia.

Yesterday a law firm said it had been contacted by 12 women thought to be from the UK, New Zealand and Australia.

Their allegations of sexual abuse could be passed to Scotland Yard, which is already reviewing a handful of new victims.

Richard Scorer, lawyer for Slater and Gordon which represents 176 victims of Savile, said the firm had been contacted by ‘up to a dozen people’ and were considering them carefully.  

Disgraced: In Australia a plaque laid in his home town near Perth has been defaced and may be pulled up while prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news Harris was convicted 

He said: ‘We back an over-arching inquiry into child abuse once those reports which are still outstanding are completed.

‘What we have discovered in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal is just how deep child abuse in institutions ran and how some people were seemingly allowed to continue their sickening crimes unchallenged.’ Mr Scorer added: ‘It is therefore vital we do everything possible now to learn from the mistakes of the past and take this opportunity to toughen the laws around the protection of children and vulnerable adults in institutions.’

Liz Dux, an abuse lawyer at the same firm, added that they planned to launch a High Court claim on behalf of the victims ‘within weeks’, to prevent Harris transferring the deeds of his home and multi-million-pound assets from three companies to his daughter or other family members.

NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said they had received an ‘explosion of calls’ from people concerned about sexual abuse, with 36 of those calls relating to 13 alleged victims of Harris.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We know there has been more reporting, what we don’t know yet is whether or not more charges will follow.

‘We will work with the police and look at any cases that they send to us to see whether there is enough evidence to bring more charges. So it is too early to say.’

Last night there were calls for a public inquiry to look into the culture at the time of historic sex abuse carried out by the likes of Harris and Savile.

Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland said: ‘We have seen another celebrity convicted of a string of appalling child sex offences; someone who has used and abused their position and their power.

‘Is it not now time that we had an overarching inquiry into the culture at that time of these historical sex offences, so that we can both bring closure to that and actually learn lessons for the future?’

Government sources said it ‘looked inevitable’ that Harris will be stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen. His case will be considered by the independent honours forfeiture committee after his sentence on Friday.
