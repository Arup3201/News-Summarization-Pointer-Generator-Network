Businessman Paul Ward was on the crest of a wave when he picked up the luxurious yacht he had paid £269,000 for at the Southampton Boat Show.

The sleek Meridian 341, a four-berth motor yacht with two state rooms and all mod cons, was every sailor’s dream.

But that dream quickly turned into a nightmare when just 15 minutes after picking up the vessel from a Hampshire boat yard, Mr Ward, 61 and his crew member John Innes were leaping for their lives, their clothes in flames, as the yacht exploded.

Mr Ward, now of Woking, Surrey, and Ms
Roads have taken out a writ seeking damages to include the cost of 
the boat at £269,000; surveyors and consultants’ fees of £25,000; 
forensic experts' fees of £9,136.67; storage costs of £3,935.31; and 
other expenses.

Destroyed: Owner Paul Ward and a crew member were forced to leap for their lives into the English Channel off the Hampshire coast after his £269,000 yacht exploded in February

Wreckage: Mr Ward and his crew member John Innes were rescued by a lifeboat and rushed to Southampton General Hospital with serious burns

He then intends to take further action for damages concerning his injuries and psychiatric damage.

Then, as they shivered in a life raft 
on a freezing cold February day, they watched in horror as the blazing 
boat, by now a ball of fire, sank beneath the waves.

The pair were rescued by a lifeboat and rushed to Southampton General Hospital with serious burns.

A spokesman for the Coastguard said: 
'When we first saw the boat in flames from our air/sea rescue helicopter
we were convinced nobody could have escaped alive. It is a miracle 
anyone survived.'

Mr Ward 
and his partner Dawn Roads are now suing dealers MGM Marine Ltd, trading
as MGM Boats, and Dun Laoghaire Yacht Services for more than £300,000.

A writ lodged at the High Court claims the yacht was defective.

Mr Ward claims he is lucky to be alive.

He
said: 'It was touch and go. First there was the explosion, then the 
smoke and flames. If we hadn’t jumped clear just when we did we would 
have had it.

'In fact, as we watched it turn into a fireball within minutes I just couldn’t believe how close we had come to death.'

Mr
Ward, who owns a coach firm that ferries rock bands around Britain, 
Europe and parts of Asia, had collected the 39ft yacht, a demonstration 
model with only 18 hours on the clock, from MGM Boats at Hamble Point 
Marina on February 8, 2010.

The trip to Rye in East Sussex, where he then lived, should have been plain sailing but instead turned into a disaster.

Mr Ward said: 'We plodded down the 
Hamble into Southampton Water where I opened her up a bit with no 
problems. Everything was fine and I said to John "Let’s have a cuppa, 
I’ll take her up to 16 knots".

'But
as I pushed the throttle forward, there was an odd noise and I turned 
to John and said "The engine didn’t sound quite right".'

Within a short time the boat was in flames and the men prepared to abandon ship.

Mr Ward said: 'I said to John, "We are going to have to get off here quick".'

By this time the whole of the bottom of the boat was in flames and as Mr Innes was making his way towards the life raft the cockpit canopy exploded showering him with burning plastic and vinyl which set his jacket and hair alight.

Mr Ward said: 'I started to beat out the globules of flame stuck to John's hair and clothes - burning my hands quite badly in the process.

'I flung the raft into the water and pulled on the rope to inflate it but by this time the flames were at our backs and my jacket and hair caught fire.

'For ten minutes we were drifting on the raft waiting for the lifeboat to pick us up and we watched the boat sink.'

Describing his injuries, Mr Ward said: 'My face was just one huge blister. I am still having trouble with my breathing and in the sunshine my face flares up and goes different shades of bright red.'

John O’Kane, managing director of MGM Boats UK, said: 'At this stage we have absolutely no comment to make.'
