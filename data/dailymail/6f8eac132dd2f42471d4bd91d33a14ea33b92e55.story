A pill that helps people stop drinking by reducing the urge for alcohol will become available in England and Wales today to those who drink at least half a bottle of wine or three pints every day.

According to experts, the drug - called nalmefene – reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support.

It is said to be suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women.

The drug - called nalmefene – reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. It will be available to people in England and Wales from today, having been launched in Scotland last October

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has today published formal guidance recommending the drug, following on from draft guidance released in October, which means that patients have the right to request it if they meet certain requirements.

Nalmefene, which also goes by the name Selincro, helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake. Experts said it is not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop drinking immediately.

The pill, which costs £3, can be taken up to once a day and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink.

Lyndsey Dudley, a spokeswoman for NICE, said the drug would be suitable for people who 'probably don't even recognise themselves as an alcoholic'.

She said: 'It is much like a patch that you might wear to give up smoking to support you to cut down on your alcohol intake. Some days you might feel stronger than others.'

Some 2.1 million Britons are believed to be mildly dependent on alcohol and around 35,000 people are expected to be given nalmefene as part of treatment for alcohol dependency in the first year.

However, the actual figure might prove to be much lower.

Data released yesterday for Scotland, where nalmefene has been approved for use since October last year, shows only 53 people have so far been prescribed the drug.

The daily pill, which costs £3, is said to be suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women

The estimate of 35,000 people is based on the prediction that 58,000 people are expected to receive psychosocial intervention for mild alcohol dependency while 60 per cent are expected to be given nalmefene.

Ms Dudley said the figure may change as 'people might not want to go down the medication route straight away'.

Information given by the drug's manufacturer Lundbeck identifies fictional examples of the sort of people eligible for nalmefene, including Sue, 39, who 'looks forward to a glass of wine after work when the kids go to bed but always finishes the bottle while cooking and eating with her husband, and opens a second bottle a few days each week'.

Professor Carole Longson, NICE health technology evaluation centre director, said: 'Many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem.

'But regularly drinking over the recommended daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health.

'Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes.

'We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence.

'When used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.'

Professor Jonathan Chick, a medical adviser for Drinkaware, said: 'Two glasses of wine per day is not by any definition "mild alcoholism".

'Nalmefene is for people who are concerned about their drinking, have tried to cut down, have been given brief advice/counselling by their doctor and are still regularly drinking more than low-risk levels.

'The risks start at 14 units per week for women and 21 for men but patients who will be prescribed nalmefene will be drinking higher amounts than that, and will have provoked changes in their brain patterns which have led to difficulty controlling their drinking.'
