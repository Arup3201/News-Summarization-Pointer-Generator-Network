A man who had his leg amputated as a child after eating candy laced with fungal spores meant to poison his father has become a cage fighting champion.

Matt Betzold was just six years old when he ate poisoned candy that was meant for his father after Betzold senior fell out with a motorcycle gang.

The fungal spores plunged Matt into a six-week coma, and in order to save his life doctors had to amputate his left leg at the knee.

However the 30-year-old, father-of-two has now fought his way back to become a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, recently winning World Fighting Federation's Flyweight champion title.

Matt Betzold, 30, has won the World Fighting Federation's Flyweight title despite having his left leg amputated below the knee when he was a child

Aged six Betzold ate candy laced with fungal spores that was meant to poison his father, plunging him into a coma. In order to save his life, doctors were forced to amputate his lower left leg

He has accomplished this despite being forced to fight on his knees because regulations ban him from wearing a prosthetic. 

Matt - aka Legbreaker - said: 'I have as much of an advantage or disadvantage as any other fighter who steps into the cage. We can all find things that work for and against us when we are fighting.

'I don't remember ever being classed as disabled and I have never accepted people telling me that I couldn't do something.

'People may use my lack of a leg as an excuse not to fight me, but it really just boils down to them realising that they won't win.

The father-of-two says he began fighting at school because he was picked on for having only one leg, but grew to love it as a sport after his brother took him to a dojo fight aged 17

'But how can you say you're a fighter, if you're not willing to fight who is put in front of you.'

In an interview with ESPN, Mr Betzold said he learned to fight from a young age because he was picked on for having only one leg.

In elementary school he began to enjoy fighting, and got into sport  at the age of 17 after his brother took him to watch his very first dojo fight.

And ever since Matt, who also teaches MMA, has dedicated his life to the gym and progressed from the amateur division to professional fights.

As well as being a champion flyweight fighter, Mr Betzold has also begun teaching the sport

Mr Betzold, who is known in the ring by his nickname 'Legbreaker', says he has as much of an advantage or disadvantage as anyone else in the ring 

He said: 'I love the challenge of starting at the bottom and climbing up the ladder of the division.

'And I love proving all of the doubters wrong, and showing my supporters that they were right when I succeed.

'I love going into a fight not knowing how the battle will end and the energy I get from the beginning of the fight camp until the final moments of the fight itself.

'And I love waking up and doing it all over again. I could go on all day about why I love MMA.'
