Luis Suarez has been offered a sensational way around his four-month football ban - as long as he plays in Kosovo.

Kosovan Superleague side Hajvalia want Suarez on a short-term deal with the country not yet FIFA members, therefore ungoverned by their laws and sanctions.

However, the controversial Uruguay striker would only pick up £1,200 a month for his services, while Hajvilia are willing to hand Liverpool £24,000 for the deal.

'As we are not part of Fifa yet, I think he can play in Kosovo, so we have an offer that we will send to Liverpool. This is the maximum we can offer,' Hajvilia's director, Xhavit Pacolli told Kosovo daily Sport Plus.

'We offered 30,000 euros and a salary of 1500 for each month. This might sound ridiculous to him, but that is all we can do.

'If he is willing to come and play for us, he is welcome. As we are not part of FIFA, it would be ideal for him.'

Suarez was hit with a four-month ban from all football activity last week for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's 1-0 win in Group D.

Despite the storm that followed, Barcelona are still on the verge of making an £80million move for the Anfield hitman.

Hajvalia ended last season's Super League in sixth place, 17 points behind champions Kosova Vushtimi - although Suarez's hopeful suitors did win last season's Kosovar Cup.

Kosovo-born stars include Switzerland's World Cup hat-trick hero Xherdan Shaqiri, former Sunderland midfielder Lorik Cana and ex-West Ham winger Valeron Behrami.

The partially-recognised state played its first national team friendly against Haiti in March.
