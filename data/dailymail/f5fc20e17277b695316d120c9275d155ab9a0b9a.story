Mexican police have detained a fitness instructor who 
allegedly murdered four children and a woman in a small town in the 
center of the country.

Filiberto 
Hernandez, 43, was detained on Thursday and confessed to five murders 
between 2010 and 2013, the
 state attorney's office in the town of San Luis Potosi said.

The office said he also raped his victims.

Deadly: The crimes took place in Tamuin, pictured, a town of 16,000 southeast of San Luis Potosi, where Hernandez was a fitness and karate teacher

The crimes took place in Tamuin, a town of 16,000 southeast of San Luis Potosi, where Hernandez was a fitness and karate teacher.

The
 state attorney said it used the confession to find the remains of two 
of his victims, 9-year old Dulce Jimena Reyes, who disappeared in April,
 and Eliehoenai Chavez, 32, abducted in May after leaving the factory 
where she worked.

He is 
also alleged to have killed Adriana Martinez, found dead in 2011 at the 
age of 13 after disappearing on the way home from school.

Crime: Since former President Felipe Calderon (pictured) launched a military offensive on Mexico's drug cartels at the end of 2006, more than 85,000 people have died. Between 2007 and 2012, the total number of murders more than doubled, rising 112 percent

State
 authorities are searching for the body of Rosa Maria Sanchez, missing 
since 2010 when she was 16, and that of 12-year old Itzel Castillo who 
disappeared in 2013, in fields close to where the others were found.

official data.
