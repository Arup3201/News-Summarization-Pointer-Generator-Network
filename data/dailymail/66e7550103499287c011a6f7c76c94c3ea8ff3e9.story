A ruthless gang of kidnappers who cut off the fingers of their victims has been arrested - after a tip off.

Polish police swooped in the early hours of the morning in the capital Warsaw where they arrested 15 alleged members.

The Mokotowska gang, named after the city district they operated from, were wanted for a series of brutal kidnappings.

Horrific: This is the man who was captured by the Mokotowska gang and held hostage for a month as they demanded £500,000 from his family. Every week they failed to pay, the gang cut off one of his fingers

Later they branched out into drug-trafficking, armed robberies and money-laundering.

In 2002, the gang kept a man locked up for a whole month after demanding £500,000 from his family.

For each week the family failed to pay, the gang cut off one of the victim’s fingers and sent it to them.

A year later, the gang kidnapped another man and threatened to do the same thing, but he managed to escape.

The gang was arrested after police received a tip-off.

Arrest: After 12 years of investigations to catch the Warsaw-based gang, police arrested 15 men in a dawn raid

Raid: Officers back by counter-terrorism police raided several apartments across the Polish capital

The 15 members now face 10 years in jail if convicted.

'On Tuesday morning officers backed by counter-terrorism police entered several apartments across Warsaw and surrounding areas,' confirmed police spokesman Mariusz Mrozek.

Besides arresting 15 suspects, police also seized a machine gun, ammunition and narcotics. Quantities of cash, mobile phones and other items were also confiscated. 

The Mokotow Group, rose to power after another band of criminals, the so-called Pruszkow Gang, was broken up by police in the mid-1990s.
