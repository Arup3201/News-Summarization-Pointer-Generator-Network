How about this for a tall tale? This critically endangered baby giraffe was born at Woburn Safari Park yesterday to the delight of her keepers.

The female nipper was born out in the 
reserve in less than two hours, with all of the herd taking a keen interest.

They carefully
surrounded the new infant, not only to welcome her in to the world, but to 
instinctively protect her with their formidable presence.

Tall tale: This as yet unnamed Rothchild Giraffe was born in less than two hours at Woburn Safari Park

Mum's the word: The new-born was just a few hours old when these pictures were taken with proud mother Frankie keeping careful watch

While fully grown giraffes have few predators in the wild, their young are preyed upon by lions, hyenas and leopards.

The calf, which was born to mother Frankie and father Casper, has not yet been named. It was Frankie's third calf, and she will spend the next 13 months weaning her.

Once she has found her feet, she will have the freedom to roam a seven-acre section of the park along with the rest of the herd, which they share with Grevy's Zebra and Scimitar Horned Oryx.

She will spend the rest of the warm 
summer months sleeping outside, but will be spared Britain's bitter 
winter months when she and the rest of the herd are brought in at night.Â 

Overseeing her young: Fully grown giraffes have 
few predators in the wild, but calves can be hunted by big cats, such as
lions and leopards, as well as packs of hyenas

Although the new giraffe is only a snip at the moment, when she is fully 
grown he will stand a proud 20ft tall (6m) and will live to about 20 
years old.

Woburn spokeswoman Dawn Jones said: 'She was born naturally yesterday at 2.40pm in the paddock. Everyone here is delighted.

'She's already 6ft tall. She was born to parents Casper and Frankie.

Endangered: The birth of the Rothschild Giraffe is great news for the subspecies as there are just 600 left in the wild

'We won't give her a name until after
about a week, but it will begin with an "n" - every year we name our 
new-born animals with a new letter and this year it's "n".

'It's the second birth we've had this year and the herd is now up to 14 with the latest addition.

'At the moment she's just sheltering,
nosing around in the grass and getting used to her new surroundings. 
She's feeding on milk from her mother.'

The birth is the latest success story the Bedfordshire wildlife park has enjoyed in breeding this endangered subspecies of Rothschild Giraffe

There are believed to be just 600 left in the wild and the park is playing a key role in safeguarding their future.

The species used to be abundant in East Africa, but their numbers have dwindled to just 13 herds across Uganda and Kenya. They are now extinct in Sudan.

A combination of habitat loss and poaching has led to their demise. Now a protected species, they used to be hunted for their tails.

They typically favour open grassland, 
scrub and woodlands. Their long necks allow them to feed on leaves from 
taller trees such as acacia and wild apricots. They also eat shoots, 
fruit and other vegetation.

According to website Rothschild's 
Giraffe Project, the subspecies was first named by Lord Walter 
Rothschild, a zoologist and member of the famous banking family 
following an expedition to East Africa in the early 1900s.

The Rothschild Giraffe is sometimes also known as the Baringo giraffe or the Ugandan giraffe and is easily distinguished from other giraffe subspecies by its unique appearance.

They are lighter in colour, their patches are less jagged and they have no markings 
below the knees as if they are wearing cream socks, making them easy to 
recognise.
