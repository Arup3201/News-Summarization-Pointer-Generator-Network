Divers recovered another 16 bodies today from the shipwreck of a fishing boat packed with 500 African migrants which sank off an Italian island.

The official death toll now stands at 127. Up to 250 people are missing and 155 have survived the accident.

Frogmen resumed their search this morning off the island of Lampedusa after a 48-hour delay due to bad weather.

Toll: A lorry door is opened to receive the bodies of the migrants who will be taken to a makeshift mortuary at the local airport

Tragedy: Italian soldiers carry one body ashore. The death toll is now officially 127

Soldiers wearing masks brought the bodies ashore and placed them onto trucks to be taken to the makeshift morgue at the airport.

Many more victims are believed to be trapped in the wreck in deep water, about one kilometre (half a mile) off the southern Italian island.

Today Pope Francis took a moment of silent pray in St Peter's Square for the victims who had sailed from many North African countries in the 20m (66ft) long boat.

Financial police Major Leonardo Ricci said the search and recovery would continue 'as long as the sea is calm and there is light.'

The boat sank last Thursday after a fire was set on board to attract attention of passing boats or people on shore when it ran into trouble.

It had travelled for two full days from the Libyan port of Misrata and those aboard thought they had reached safety when they saw the lights of Lampedusa.

It is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side. Some of the survivors were in the water for three hours clinging to anything buoyant - even empty bottles.

The survivors are to be placed under 
investigation for 'clandestine immigration', under a controversial immigration law which carries a 5,000-euro (Â£4,230; $6,780) fine.

The BBC reported that France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.

Italy has said it will amend immigration 
laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions 
discourage people from helping migrants in distress.

An Italian fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, has claimed coastguard officers wasted time filming the rescue operation .

He was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying: 'They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it.'

Morgue: The makeshift area of the airport where all the coffins were lined up as survivors paid their respects

Tragic journey: The ship apparently capsized, spilling the passengers into the sea. Some were in the water for three hours

Earlier this week, the scale of the tragedy of Lampedusa was made shockingly clear when survivors of the tragedy paid their respects at the morgue inside an airport hangar.

All of the caskets had a single white rose on top except for the four of the youngest victims, which had stuffed animals.

The coffins were numbered - a teddy bear wearing a smile and a blue shirt with a heart was placed above casket No. 92.

The
ceremony took place hours after Italian fishermen threw a bouquet of 
yellow flowers near the exact spot where the migrant boat sank, honking 
their foghorns in tribute to the dead.
