These magnificent mountains look almost unreal as they constantly change colour with the light and weather.

British photographer Andro Loria, 50, said the altering shadows it was like watching an 'everlasting show' pass over the landscape. He took the shots on a hiking tour through the Landmannalaugar Highlands in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve.

Mr Loria, a scientist from north west London, said the scene was 'unearthly' and at times he felt like he was walking across the moon. Captivated by the area's beauty, he said he slowed the rest of the group down because he kept stopping to take 'hundreds' of photos.

The mountains appear to change colour dependent on the light and the weather

Mr Loria, who is engaged to be married, said: 'The colourful mountains change colours constantly according to the light and weather.

'The patches of ice or snow in spring or early summer add more contrast to the scenery; some ice patches on slopes survive into late summer. The hills are usually yellow and gold with splashes of grey and blue and red or purple from sulphur rich minerals due to volcanic activity. Green moss adds an extra colour.

'As the relief is rather ragged you have a constant interplay between light, colour and shades creating a never ending show. It is a paradise for photography.'

The shots include Mt. Brennisteinsalda, which means 'Sulphur Wave', an 850 metre high active volcano with hot sulphur springs on its slopes.

Mr Loria added: 'The combination of contrasting colour and light in ever-changing shapes due to variable light was absolutely unique. I had never seen anything like it before. Colours added by volcanic activity made it all look almost unreal and unearthy.

'You almost feel like you are crossing a lunar landscape at times.

'The majority of peaks in Landmannalaugar are between 800-1200m above sea level. Due to the location of the highlands the view from the top spots allows you to see incredible panoramas. The constant interplay of light, shapes, shades and colour is very captivating.

'The views from the tops of the highest hills or mountains are very impressive, they are easy to get to and at places are almost flat and barren.' 

The photographer Loria described it as almost like passing over a lunar landscape

The photographs are so vivid they look more like paintings, with the array of colours captured beautifully

He described the walker shown in one of the shots - an American man from the group who is more than 70 years old - inspired some of his best snaps.

Mr Loria added: 'I wish I will still be travelling like him when I get to that age. He was also a reason I took a couple of my favourite shots. They were taken late, the sun was low providing beautiful light and lighting up hills with extra splashes of gold and pink.

'I turned back to see if my fellow walker was OK and after seeing the scene took a few shots. The way he walked along the ridge, blending into the landscape, was fantastic. It was one of those men and nature being united feelings.'

The rock formations at a mountain range in Iceland are unique, and unlike others in the world

The colours made by the volcanic activity give the photos an unearthly feel to them
