Our guide shouts: ‘Do you know what culture is?’ to a group of rowdy Americans trying to climb a column in  the gladiators’ arena. Before they can answer, he adds: ‘I don’t think you do.’

We are just starting our tour of Pompeii, and it is already obvious that Giuseppe runs a tight ship.

When Vesuvius erupted (‘How far away is Vesuvius? I already told you. Nine miles.’) on August 24, AD 79, the explosion was the equivalent of two atomic bombs being detonated.

Blast from the past: Pompeii, where the Temple of Apollo recalls former glories, is a wonderful site

Anyone who did not escape the ash was asphyxiated.

‘They had a few minutes when they knew their fate,’ Giuseppe informs us solemnly.

One of the remarkable plaster-cast bodies that were formed using the spaces these unfortunate souls left in the earth when they shrank to nothing — displayed in a glass cabinet — shows a contorted man on his back, with his hands up in front of him. His terror is almost palpable.

There are only nine of us on this escorted tour with Back-Roads Touring, which is a refreshingly intimate luxury as Guiseppe reveals Pompeii’s sophistication.

It was built on a grid, with roads running north to south and east to west - with stepping stones across the main street to help pedestrians avoid cascading water.

Much maligned: Naples has a reputation for grime and crime - but few cities have a more picturesque setting

They also built vaulted ceilings at the public baths (so condensation did not drip on people having massages), bakeries on most street corners and ornate houses. They even used to write graffiti.

These flourishes of street art have modern-day echoes in Naples, the starting point for our tour, a 15-mile hop from Pompeii. Almost every space on the city’s pastel-coloured buildings has been used as an informal canvas.

Naples is known for grime, but it can be enthralling, its narrow lanes packed with people, beeping mopeds and laundry hanging from balconies.

Our group get along well. We also have plenty of time to ourselves and don’t eat every meal  together, so it never feels like a school trip.

Here's one I made earlier: Kate emerges from her cookery class at Tenuta Seliano, clutching an Easter cake - and perhaps still wondering about her encounter with a naked Prince Harry in Naples (not the one shown here)

The Via San Gregorio Armeno is a wonderful Neapolitan oddity — an alley where Christmas is a permanent affair. Little workshops sell festive figurines, although I struggle to grasp how the naked statuette of Prince Harry (or the, thankfully, clothed Silvio Berlusconi) could be a seasonal bauble.

We are all awestruck when we enter the Sansevero Chapel and glimpse its marble centrepiece, Il Cristo Velato (The Veiled Christ), carved in 1753 by Giuseppe Sanmartino.

We move on to Tenuta Seliano in Campania. Perfectly positioned for a trip to the nearby ruined Greek temples at Paestum, it is part of Baronessa Cecilia Baratta’s 250-acre buffalo farm.

She turned this cluster of stone buildings into a haven for rural tourism in 1991.

Come explore: Naples has many intriguing districts - like the Quartiere Spagnoli - that many visitors never see

Tenuta Seliano also features a splendid old farmhouse, the Masseria Eliseo.

Here, the Baronessa and her kitchen staff give us a cooking lesson, making ricotta-filled ravioli, Easter cake, sublime pizza and fried mozzarella.

I eat my bodyweight in carbohydrates, and we tour the farm. The buffalo are docile and curious. One licks my foot with a giant grey tongue as the cows queue to be milked.

As we return to the house we see that a calf has just been born.

Its innocent expression is the exact opposite of the frightened faces frozen in time at Pompeii.
