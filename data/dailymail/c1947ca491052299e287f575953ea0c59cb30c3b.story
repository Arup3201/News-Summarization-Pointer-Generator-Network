Understaffed: The number of Army recruits has dropped by a third since recruitment was privatised in March

The number of rookie soldiers joining the Army has dropped by more than a third since the Government outsourced recruitment in a Â£440million deal aimed at saving money.

The number of recruits attending selection interviews and tests has fallen by 35 per cent since a 10 year deal was made with private services company Capita back in March.

The number of those signing up for officer roles has dropped by nearly half, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The newspaper has obtained figures under the Freedom of Information Act that confirm that numbers are down more than 1,750 in the first four months of the Capita contract.

Since March, 3,259 recruits have signed up compared with more than 5,000 in the corresponding four months in 2012.

Less than 200 officers have been sent for selection compared to 379 last year.

Senior officers have complained that cuts to the defence budget give off the impression that the Army is no longer recruiting.

One officer said that although the service 'delivers savings, it doesn't deliver a result.'

The drop in recruits has raised concerns that operations could become more dangerous for existing soldiers with the Army already more than 3,600 personnel short.

Since Capita took over recruitment, new recruits are struggling to sign up online and some application forms are being lost or held up, claim understaffed Army regiments.

They blame a heavy reliance on the internet to drive recruitment - new recruits used to be given guidance when filling out paper application forms.

An Army source told the Telegraph: '(Recruitment) is less than half what it was last year.

'There's a big lack of knowledge about how many people are in the system and where they are in the process.'

Both Capita and the Ministry of Defence have said that the contract is in its infancy and that any teething problems would be ironed out.
