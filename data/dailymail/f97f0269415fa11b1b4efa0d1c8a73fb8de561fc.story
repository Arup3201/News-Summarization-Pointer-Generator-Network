Audrionna Rhoades, 21, told family she left the boy sleeping on a futon in her mobile home

A mother from Michigan has been charged with murder following the death of her two-year-old son from heatstroke after he was left in a minivan in 70 degree heat.

Audrionna Rhoads, 21, appeared upset during her arraignment for second degree murder and child negligent abuse, which carry a life sentence and a 15 year sentence respectively.

She was arrested yesterday after the body of her son James Nelson was found still buckled in to his car seat at 6pm on Tuesday, September 3rd.

Rhoades, from a trailer park in Shelby Township, Michigan, told her family that she left her son asleep on a futon in the 
mobile home she shared with a roommate, who also was sleeping, as she 
left for work.

But authorities believe she put the toddler in the car at 8.30am before driving another car off to work, meaning he was trapped for between 10 and 11 hours.

According to Shelby Township Police Chief Roland Woelkers, Rhoades worked weekdays and usually placed the boy in her car on the way to work.

The body was discovered by Johnny Rhoads, Audrionna's father, after a neighbour noticed the boy's foot through the car window.

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press, he said: 'I go down there, and he’s dead. He’s in the van, strapped in his frickin’ car seat, sopping wet, blue.

'My girlfriend tried CPR, but he was dead. The poor baby.'

Audrionna's grandmother, Mary Catenacci said: '(Rhoades) looked me in the eye and said, "I did not put that baby in the car."'

Hospital workers said the boy had a temperature of 108F when he was brought in, and a later autopsy concluded he died of hyperthermia.

The temperature reached the mid-70s on the day in question, but could have been as high as 130F inside the van, police said.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, heatstroke inside cars can occur with outside temperatures as low as 57 degrees.

The news comes on the same day an Arizona father was also arraigned on a charge of second degree murder after he left his one-year-old son in his car and turned the air conditioning off.

Marques left his baby in a car with the windows up because he claims he couldn't find a babysitter

Brokale Lytte Marques, 28, was arrested on Saturday after he left his son in the parking lot of a Scottsdale shopping area.

Marques told police he had left the baby in the car seat when he was unable to find a babysitter so he could go to work.

He left the engine and air conditioning running while he went to a fast food restaurant, then returned and, thinking it would be cool enough for his son, turned the car off.

When he returned at 2pm he found his son in a lethargic state and flagged down security to help.

The boy was rushed to hospital in a critical condition but died around 10.30pm on Monday.

Both Rhoads and Marques are being held on $500,000 bonds.
