A couple have found a metre-wide safe they believe is more than a century old in their back garden, but there's just one problem. They've no idea how to get into it.

David and Nikki Maguire found the heavy, rusting box - made by the same firm which supplied the Titanic - sticking out of the earth after they drained their
 garden pond in Gateshead.

Mr Maguire, 34, spent an afternoon tirelessly shifting heaps of soil and was astounded to find the safe completely intact.

Under lock and key: David and Nikki Maguire - and their three-year-old daughter Alice - found this rusting fire-proof safe at the bottom of their garden in Gateshead, but without a key its contents are a mystery

Mystery: The safe bears the logo of Milners, a firm whose founder used bonfires to show his safes' strength

A locksmith is now due to visit the couple tomorrow morning - but for the moment, they are enjoying the mystery.

'We’ve got a little girl Alice, who is three, so we 
drained the pond,' said Mrs Maguire, 32, who works for St Oswald's Hospice in Newcastle.

Plaything: Alice, three, with her new garden toy

'We’d seen this bit of bronze metal 
poking out from where the old pond used to be for a while but just 
thought it was part of an old pump.

'We were completely amazed when it 
turned out to be the top of a safe. My house was built in the 1920s, but
 this looks a lot older than that.'

She added: 'It’s
 so heavy to lift, we can barely do it between us, so we’ve had to roll 
it across the garden and we can hear there’s something inside.. It could
 just be soil after all these years, but it might be something 
interesting, you never know!'

'Before my house was built, there were
 flats here. I don’t know if it’s been brought up here to be buried 
especially when they were building the houses. We’ve just got no idea.'

The
 safe was made by Milners, which began working in 1814 under Thomas 
Milner and became famous for developing the world’s first fire-proof 
safes.

The businessman used 
to wow crowds with stunts involving elaborate street bonfires to 
demonstrate that his safes could protect anything that was inside, and 
five of them were used on the Titanic.

On
 the front of the safe found in the Maguires’ garden is a plaque which 
reads ‘Milners of London, Manchester and Liverpool’ and ‘Patent fire 
resisting special safe’.

It is likely to date from between the mid-19th Century and 1955, when the Milner company merged with the firm Chatwood.

A locksmith will be coming to the couple's home tomorrow morning to prise open the safe, and it could be a difficult job.

Mystery solved: The couple are due to be visited by a locksmith tomorrow who will try and prise the box open

Grand: The firm supplied five of the high-security safes that were used on the doomed liner Titanic in 1912

'It's not in the best condition,' said Mrs Maguire. 'I don't know how they're going to get into it. It could take a long time.'

Other safes in a good condition sell for hundreds of pounds on eBay.

But Mrs Maguire and her husband, a manager at the Baltic modern art gallery in Gateshead, said they would be happy to give it to a local museum for free.

'I've no desire to keep it,' she said. 'It's big and it's ugly and I don't know what I would do with it.'
