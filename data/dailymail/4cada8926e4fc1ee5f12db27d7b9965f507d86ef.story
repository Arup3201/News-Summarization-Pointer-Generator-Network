The family of one of the schoolgirls feared to have fled to join Islamic State discovered a handwritten shopping list of items which included tips for crossing into Syria, it emerged last night.

Details of prices for flights to Turkey, visa money, coaches, hotels, taxis and other supplies were found on a diary and planner page in one of the girl’s bedrooms.

It also includes sinister tips for how to slip over the Turkish border and into IS-held territory, scrawled in different handwriting at the bottom of the page.

The parents of one of the three schoolgirls (pictured) from London who fled to join ISIS in Syria have found a list of essential items for their trip, including underwear, an epilator, and £1,000 plane tickets

This hand-written list shows some of the vital items the ISIS recruits needed to buy 

The list of purchases, seen by The Guardian, includes a £50 epilator, two sets of £12 underwear for two girls, socks for £4 and a phone for £75.

Next to each item is one of the initials of the girl’s first name, and appears to show either who was to purchase them or who they were for.

Below the list of items to buy ahead of the trip is a list of the costs of reaching Turkey, and appears to be written in different handwriting. 

The total cost of the items, which includes £1,000 plane tickets to Turkey and appears to match with an Isis online guide for potential recruits, amounts to £2,190.

The list was found in one of the girl’s bedrooms and has now been handed to police investigating the girls' disappearance.

Their families of three girls - Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum - told the Guardian in an interview last week they had no idea how the girls could have raised the money for the trip.

They also alleged that the police had mishandled their case, saying they were not informed that another girl from the same school had disappeared and was thought to have gone to Syria.

Family members will today testify before the home affairs committee of MPs. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will also appear.

The three girls went missing two weeks ago after boarding a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul.

They were then pictured at a bus stop on the outskirts of the capital, in Bayrampasa, where it is thought they waited for up to 18 hours before travelling to the border town of Arai.

From there they crossed into Syria, and it was reported yesterday that the girls are now in Raqqa, the headquarters of ISIS, where it is thought they will be married to Islamic State fighters.
