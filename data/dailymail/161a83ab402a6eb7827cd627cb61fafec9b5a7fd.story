Tickets sold for the charity event were priced between $US500 to $US5,000 and despite the singer pulling out last minute, everyone spoke about how 'awesome' he is. 

Olympian Bruce Jenner and ice hockey professional Wayne Gretzky were among the crowd who attended the charity.

According to TMZ, the musician found out about his father-in-law's death while driving to the event.

Urban took a private jet and immediately made his way back home in Nashville to be with his wife Nicole.

Writing on Facebook, the singer confirmed he had cancelled his performance and expressed his sadness. 

'I'm so very sorry that I cannot perform this weekend,' he wrote. 'We are in a deep state of grief at the passing of Nic's father and are heading to Australia to be with family.
