Neither Cameroon nor Mali could take advantage of the Ivory Coast’s slip-up against Guinea and go top of Group D of the Africa Cup of Nations, as the sides played out the tournament’s fifth 1-1 draw in the first eight games.

Ambroise Oyongo’s late equalizer denied Mali all three points, cancelling out Sambou Yatabere’s opener, and leaving all four teams level after the first round of matches.

In a game of few chances but plenty of heavy tackling it was always likely to take a set-piece or a defensive error to break the deadlock – in the end, the opening goal had an element of both.

When a deep free kick was pumped into the box, not only did the Cameroon defence fail to deal with it first time, but they also allowed Yatabare an incredible amount of time and space at the far post to collect the second ball.

The Guingamp winger stayed calm, brought the ball down with his chest, before smashing it past Joseph Ondoa.

But despite keeping Cameroon at arm’s length for the vast majority of the game, Mali could not hold on for the win, as Raoul Loe’s superb pass six minutes from time split the defence, and Ovongo finished coolly past Soumaila Diakite.

Mali thought they had a winner, and Yatabare his second, when he headed home the rebound from Seydou Keita’s stoppage time free kick, but he was rightly adjudged to be offside.

For the fourth day in a row the stadium – this time a 35,000-seater in Equatorial Guinea’s capital Malabo - was not just full to capacity but packed well beyond, and a raucus atmosphere helped to make up for a disappointing lack of quality in attacking areas.

Cameroon enjoyed most of the possession in the early stages, but it was Mali who had more clear-cut chances throughout.

Wolves winger Bakary Sako was always a threat, his combination of pace and power giving Cameroon full back Abroise Oyongo a torrid time.

It was Sako who had the game’s first chance, exchanging passes with Adamba Tamboura before Sako bursting into the box and forcing a good save from keeper with a powerful shot.

From the resultant corner Mustapha Yatabare should really have made it 1-0, meeting a cross at the back post but heading wide from close range.

The Wolves man, one of very few to run purposefully in a game full of lateral passes, also forced Ondoa into a good save at his near post after powering past Oyongo again, but he might have been better served picking out Mustapha Yatabare in the centre.

Cameroon captain Eric Choupo-Mpong saw a powerful header tipped over by Soumaila Diakite in the first half, while Porto forward Vincent Aboubakar dragged a shot across the face of goal in the second, but for the most part Cameroon, unbeaten in qualifying, produced very little going forward until Oyongo’s dramatic equalizer.
