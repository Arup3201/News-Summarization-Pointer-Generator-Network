Yorkshire are planning the most radical overhaul of Headingley in its 125-year history in a bid to preserve the ground's Test match status.

The county want to rebuild one of the stands and the pavilion and up the capacity from 17,000 to 20,000, making it a world-class venue.

Headingley will always be synonymous with the famous Ashes Test of 1981, when Ian Botham dragged England to victory from a seemingly impossible position and them Bob Willis finished the job with the ball.

But Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves acknowledged that if the ground was to be the scene of any more epic Tests.

Graves said: 'This is the most ambitious project the club and the venue will have undertaken since the ground was first established 125 years ago.

'Our ambitions are clear. We want to create a stadium that is amongst finest in the world and enable Yorkshire to continue to stage major international fixtures over the long term.

'It is vital that we don’t lose sight of our objectives. As other venues around the country continue to invest in their facilities, we cannot afford to standstill and expect that Headingley will always host international cricket.

'The stark reality is that if our stadium fails to evolve we will lose our Test match status, which would be a devastating blow to the region.'

The renovation will be in six stages 
and will include the addition of permanent floodlights, the 
redevelopment of the stand connected to the neighbouring rugby ground 
and a new pavilion in the north-west corner of the ground. Nearly 1,000 
seats will also be added to the north-east stand.

A new pavilion and media centre were built at Headingley in 2010.

Headingley
 will host this summer’s second Test match against Sri Lanka beginning 
on June 20, as well as the fifth one-day international against India on 
September 5 and will also host a Test against New Zealand and an ODI 
against Australia in 2015.
