This is the moment a group of coastguards edged along a cliff in gale force winds and high seas as they tried in vain to save a woman who drowned yesterday.

The victim and her brother were 'coasteering', a practice which involves climbing on cliffs and swimming in the sea in order to make their way around the shoreline.

She died after being swept into a tiny cave at a beauty spot and trapped by the sea swelling around her on the Dorset coast.

As strong winds lashed much of the country, desperate rescuers spent two hours talking to the 30-year-old through a blowhole – but were unable to reach her in time to save her life.

The woman was 'coasteering', which involves adventurers free climbing up and along a rock face and jumping into water

Coasteering is an extreme sport which involves exploring rocky shorelines without a boat.

Participants both climb along cliff faces and swim close to the shore to navigate around areas which are inaccessible on foot.

The
sport appeals to thrillseekers because it allows them to jump into the 
ocean from remote cliffs. The first mention of coasteering was 40 years 
ago, but it did not catch on amongst the general population until the 
1990s.

Coasteering fans
are advised to wear safety gear such as a helmet, wetsuit and 
lifejacket due to the risks involved in exposing themselves to the 
elements.

Novices are also recommended to join a tour led by a qualified instructor, who can be found in many coastal towns.

A brave rescuer risked his own safety to 
crawl down into the cave, but found her dead and could not retrieve her 
body due to the severe weather.

Two lifeboat crews battled against 
force nine 50mph winds to try to get to the mouth of the cave, with a 
three metre sea swell whipping up and forcing them back.

The search for the woman's body is continuing today.

The victim had been 
‘coasteering’ with her 31-year-old brother – who was unhurt – at a 
beauty spot known as Tilly Whim caves, near Swanage, Dorset.

Coasteering
is an adventure sport that involves free climbing up and along a rock 
face and jumping into the water to swim at points where the rocks are 
too difficult to navigate.

It is believed the
woman, from London, had jumped off the side of the cliffs at Tilly Whim when she was 
dragged into the opening of the cave by the fierce waves.

A member of the public raised the alarm when he spotted her brother in difficulty in the water at about 2.55pm on Saturday.

It
was only when he was rescued by a coastguard helicopter winchman that 
he was able to tell the crew his sister was trapped in the base of the 
cliffs.

Dave Turnbull, of 
the Swanage lifeboat, said: ‘The woman had been washed into a small cave
at the base of the cliffs that had a blowhole at the top that wasn’t 
very accessible.

‘The 
helicopter winchman got into a position where he could talk to her 
through the gap. She seemed to be out of the water but there was no way 
we could reach her.

‘As the 
tide rose, many further attempts to reach her were made but the rough 
conditions, with the tide rising and seas breaking over the heads of the
rescuers at times, proved impossible to overcome.  

‘With
the tide getting higher another coastguard officer entered through the 
blowhole but found the woman had sadly succumbed to the conditions. It 
was very sad and a truly awful situation to have been in.’

A
spokesman for Portland coastguard said the unnamed officer had placed 
himself in great danger in crawling down through the gap.

She
said: 'The lifeboat crews had tried to reach the woman through the 
opening in the front and entering the blowhole from the top was the last
resort as it was extremely dangerous.

'The hole was just about wide enough for 
one person to fit in and it was 15ft deep. The officer knew the dangers 
and made the decision to go into the gap.

'The water was charging in through the cave practically filling it up and then shooting up the hole, pushing the officer back up. The casualty had been communicating but unfortunately she was found to be deceased when the officer entered the cave.

'Our thoughts are with her family. It was a horrible thing for anyone to have to go through and it had an unfortunate and tragic outcome.'

Dave
Wrixton, a police spokesman, said the man who was rescued ‘apart from 
being cold and shaken up was said to have been unhurt.’

It is thought the man and woman had been coasteering by themselves and were not part of a group.

Peter Boyce, who organises coasteering expeditions in the area, said that he always checks that conditions are safe before sending groups out along the cliffs.

'The weather conditions were not good for coasteering yesterday,' he told The Times. 'Before we go out, we check certain websites to look at the height of the waves and the distance between the waves.'

the weather was calm in parts of the country over the weekend, there 
were fierce gales in other areas, with high winds whipping up dramatic 
waves at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex.
