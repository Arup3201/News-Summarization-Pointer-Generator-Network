Carer Agneskia Sztokmanska, 45, was convicted of neglect at Salisbury Crown Court after leaving her patients  feeling 'scared, angry and helpless'

A senior carer who threw shoes at elderly dementia patients and dragged one across the floor by the hair has been convicted of neglect.

Agneskia Sztokmanska, 45, called her vulnerable patients 'monsters' and left them feeling 'scared, angry and helpless' during her reign of terror at Milford Manor in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

She was convicted of ill treatment or wilfully neglecting a person who lacks mental capacity yesterday at Salisbury Crown Court and could face jail.

The 45-year-old carer was investigated when a staff member drew attention to two 'small marks' on the face of a resident.

She denied seven counts of ill treatment, but was convicted of five, including throwing four or five shoes at one resident's chest to get him to sit down.

A witness said she told all residents - many of whom would wander around at night - to be in bed at 10pm so she could 'relax on the sofa' in the lounge.

Sztokmanska worked at Milford Manor care home from 2010 to 2013, becoming a senior carer in 2012.

Prosecutor Sharon Douglass said: 'Agneskia Sztokmanska was supposed to care for her patients, who she knew were vulnerable and dependant due to the fact that they suffered from dementia.

'She had been a senior carer at Milford Manor Care Home for three years and would have received the necessary training and therefore knew that the way she was treating her patients was wrong and cruel.

'Other carers at the care home raised the alarm when they noticed bruises on some of the patients and witnessed the defendant throwing her shoe on four occasions to the chest of one of her patients to make him sit down.

'Other colleagues also noticed how she used derogatory terms to describe the patients such as 'monsters' and 'idiots'.

'We would like to thank all the carers who gave evidence at the trial and who helped us to secure this conviction.

'This prosecution sends a strong message to those who abuse vulnerable people who lack mental capacity believing they will not be caught.

'Our thoughts go to the victims in this case, some of whom have since died, and their families, who had to deal with the knowledge that their loved ones had been mistreated in this way.

'The Crown Prosecution Service and the Police take these offences very seriously and the CPS will prosecute vigorously these cases when it has sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest.'

Sztokmanska will be sentenced at Swindon Crown Court on Friday October 24.
