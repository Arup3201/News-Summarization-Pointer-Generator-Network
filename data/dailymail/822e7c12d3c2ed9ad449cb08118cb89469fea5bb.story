Juan Cuadrado failed to justify his £27million price tag as Fiorentina threw away a first half lead to draw 1-1 with Roma at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. 

Mario Gomez opened the scoring but the hosts couldn't hold on and former Viola forward Adem Ljajic equalised shortly after the break. 

While Colombian midfielder Cuadrado showed moments of talent, some of his decision making at key moments could leave Chelsea scouts wondering if he's really worth his considerable release clause.

Gomez scored just three goals for Fiorentina last season, that's a tally he's now matched in his last two games alone. 

In the 19th minute, David Pizarro drilled a shot into the area and the German forward instinctively stuck his foot in its path, deflecting the ball past the helpless Morgan de Sanctis from six yards out. 

As the Roma players called for offside, Gomez soaked up applause from the home fans with a bravado that belied his woeful early-season form.

Going behind was no less then the visitors deserved, but they came close to an equaliser shortly after. 

Radja Nainggolan rose to beat his marker at a corner but his header couldn't find a way past Viola goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who tipped it over the bar acrobatically.

Rudi Garcia's night got worse in the 34th minute when Kevin Strootman, who spent nine months out injured last season, was taken off with knee problem. 

And Roma's French manager evidently had stern words with his side at half time because they were level three minutes after the break. 

Juan Iturbe crossed for former Fiorentina man Ljajic who took one touch before guiding it home from close-range. 

As the game wore on only the home side looked like scoring a winner but a lack of cutting edge meant both sides were left frustrated with a draw that only benefited their rivals.

Second-placed Roma are now seven points behind league leaders Juventus while Fiorentina, whose main aim this season is Champions league qualification, remain two points adrift of the European places.
