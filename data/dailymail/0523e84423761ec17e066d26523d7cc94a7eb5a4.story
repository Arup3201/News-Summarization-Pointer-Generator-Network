A missing British man has been found living in Germany three years after he disappeared from his home because he was sacked from a call centre.

Stuart Higham, now 27, was last seen on January 4, 2011 near his home in Mapperley Park, Nottingham.

His parents believed he fled Britain because he was upset at losing his job at a call centre.

Stuart Higham disappeared from his home in Nottinghamshire in 2011 after he was sacked from his call centre job. He has now been found living in Germany, police confirmed today

It is thought he then traveled to Europe before making his way to Germany. He was finally tracked down in the country on Friday night.

It is currently unknown why the man decided to go to Germany, or where exactly he was found.

Last month Mr Higham's parents, 
Christopher, 58, and Lorraine, 59, made a heart-felt appeal on the 
anniversary of his disappearance.

Mrs Higham said: 'He seemed fine on his birthday - he was very chatty. We had a nice lunch.

'He had been happy all over Christmas.

'He hadn't told us he'd lost his job a few months before. Maybe that was the reason he moved but we just don't know.

'He's a person who will chat to anybody and he's really funny. We all miss him so much. He was always the joker.'

Lorraine and Chris Higham last month made an emotional plea for those with any information about their son to come forward. They will now fly to the country to be reunited with Stuart, reports suggest

She added: 'It's incredibly hard for us, especially around Christmas and his birthday.

'His brother and sister miss him loads. Everyone is so worried, it just feels horrible.

'I hate it when people phone me and don't leave a message because I immediately think it is Stuart.

'I still look at every young man in the street - expecting it to be him.'

The couple are expected to fly out to Germany on Monday to be reunited with their long-lost son.

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'A Nottingham man missing for three years has been found safe and well.

'Stuart Higham, 27, was last seen in Mapperley Park on 4 January 2011 after spending time with friends.'It was thought that he may have travelled to Europe and he has now been located in Germany.

'Mr Highamâ€™s family have been informed. Nottinghamshire Police would like to thank media for their help.
