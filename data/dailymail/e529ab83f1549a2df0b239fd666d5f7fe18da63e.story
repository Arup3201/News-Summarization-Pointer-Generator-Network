Ravel Morrison could be handed a route back into West Ham's first-team fold next season to help Sam Allardyce's pursuit of sexy football.  

But uncertainty over his contractual situation is threatening plans to re-integrate the England Under-21 star back into the Hammers first-team fold.

Allardyce has kept his job at Upton Park despite being under immense pressure from fans over what they perceive as his negative tactics.

Back in town? Ravel Morrison could return to West Ham next season after being shipped out on loan

The former Bolton boss has been told his side must play more entertaining football next season and secure a top 10 finish.

There is a feeling among the West Ham hierarchy that Morrison's attacking talents can help Allardyce achieve his targets next season.

Morrison's early season displays for the Hammers last season put the forward on the cusp of the senior England squad.

But after falling out of favour with Allardyce the former Manchester United man was sent out on-loan to Queens Park Rangers - much to the surprise of Hammers fans given he was arguably the club's most potent and entertaining player.

However, there is a willingness from some at Upton Park for Morrison to be back involved with the West Ham first team next season given his attacking ability.

Morrison's future at Upton Park, though, will depend on the outcome of summer contract talks.

He has just 12 months left on his current deal - and if the club cannot agree a new contract then they will look to cash in on Morrison to avoid losing him on a Bosman next summer.

In addition, Morrison's relationship with Allardyce is likely to need some repair work ahead of the forward's possible return.

Sportsmail sources have indicated that the 21-year-old's bond with Allardyce deteriorated in the weeks leading up to his loan move to QPR.

Rangers boss Harry Redknapp could look to pounce on the uncertainty surrounding Morrison's future by making a permanent move for the forward should they win promotion to the Barclays Premier League.

Likewise, Manchester City, who considered a move for Morrison in January, may look to the forward in their attempts to improve their homegrown quota for next season.
