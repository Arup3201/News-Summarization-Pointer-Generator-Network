'Fortunate to be alive': Rebecca Johnson was left with rhabdomyolysis after spending just one hour in the gym with a personal trainer

When Rebecca Johnson started to struggle during her first session with a personal trainer at her local gym, she pushed herself to persevere, thinking ‘no pain, no gain’.

Just hours later the 30-year-old was rushed to hospital suffering from severe muscle damage brought on by exercising too hard.

Doctors told her that she was suffering from rhabdomyolysis, a rare condition which could have caused her kidneys to fail if left untreated.

She spent four days in hospital on a drip and has been unable to return to work as a goldsmith since the session last month because her arms are still too weak.

Now Miss Johnson wants to warn others about the perils of over-exercising, which could prove life-threatening even with the support of a professional.

Miss Johnson, who runs regularly, paid £40 for an hour-long session at the LA Fitness gym near her home in Brighton. 

She said: ‘I did pull-ups, weights, bench press-ups and found it incredibly hard going.

‘A few times I said to the personal trainer I was finding it tough and I didn’t know if I could carry on.

'But he encouraged me to dig deep to do the best possible. As he was the professional, I did as he asked. I thought no pain, no gain.’

‘And although my arms felt like jelly at the end of it, I reassured myself that was just the result of a healthy workout.'

When she woke the next day, Miss Johnson could barely move. ‘I was in such agony I couldn’t straighten my arms.

'It was difficult to work - I make jewellery for a living but my arms were so painful it was impossible to hold the tools.'

At 3pm she went to the toilet and noticed her urine was tea coloured.

‘I now know this is a classic sign of rhabdomyolysis because it was full of blood,’ she says, ‘but then I just thought I must be dehydrated and drank more water.'

By the evening Miss Johnson’s arms had started to swell so she arranged to see an out-of-hours doctor.

The 30-year-old was admitted to hospital after an out-of-hours doctor took 'one look' at her arms. She was placed on a drip for four days

‘He took one look at my arms, and after testing my urine said I needed to go to hospital straight away,’ she said.

Rhabdomyolysis is triggered when muscles start to break down during strenuous exercise, resulting in a toxic fluid leaking into the body which can cause the kidneys to fail. 

The condition often occurs in people injured in disasters such as earthquakes or bombings but is also caused by strenuous exercise and can occur in professional athletes who overdo it.

It occurs when the muscles are damaged resulting in the muscle protein myoglobin leaking into the urine.

A keen runner, Rebecca spent £40 on her one-hour session with the personal trainer at LA Fitness in Brighton

The 30-year-old said she feels 'very fortunate to be alive' after the ordeal

The toxic leaking fluid, which should
 never be in the blood, can damage the kidneys, which desperately try to
 filter it out or cause the heart to beat irregularly causing a cardiac 
arrest.

Treatment involves being put on a drip to flush out the toxins.

Rebecca wants to warn others of the dangers of overdoing it at the gym

‘When
 the doctors explained it can lead to potentially life threatening 
kidney failure, I realised how lucky I was I sought help when I did. I 
now feel incredibly fortunate to be alive.’

Miss Johnson said: ‘I was stunned when they said that one hour’s exercise had caused it.’

Three weeks later her arms are still weak and she has been told it could be a month before full feeling returns.

She has complained to LA Fitness, saying trainers should be taught about the risk of pushing people to do too much too soon.

She added: ‘I don’t personally blame the trainer. I just don’t think any of them know about this condition.’

‘I can imagine lots of people are joining gyms to shape up to Christmas and want to warn them of the dangers.’

A spokesman for LA Fitness said: ‘We take the health and well-being of our customers very seriously and we’re really sorry that this happened to Rebecca.

‘All our personal trainers are fully qualified. We understand that this particular condition is incredibly rare and cannot be pre-screened for.

‘However, given the experience at Brighton we have advised our teams to ensure they are fully aware of this.’
