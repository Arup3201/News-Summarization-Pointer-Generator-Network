A woman who was just 14 when she accompanied her 19-year-old boyfriend on a killing spree is set to ask for a pardon 57 years after she was jailed, insisting she didn't kill anybody and her sentence was unfair.

Caril Ann Fugate, now 71, was on a two-month road trip with notorious mass murderer Charles Starkweather from Lincoln, Nebraska, to Wyoming  when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 58. 

High school dropout Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed for his crimes in September 1959. 

Fugate, who says she was forced to accompany the killer, was found guilty of being an accessory to first-degree murder in connection with the death of 17-year-old victim Robert Jensen. She was sentenced to life but was released after 17 years. 

Defense attorney John Stevens Berry, who wrote a book earlier this year suggesting Fugate was unfairly convicted, is backing her plea and is hoping the move will become a campaign issue in the Nebraska gubernatorial race, according to the Omaha World Herald.

Plea: Caril Ann Fugate (pictured left at 15) was on a road trip with  mass murderer Charles Starkweather (then 19) between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Wyoming when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 1958

Defiance: Fugate (pictured with her late husband Frederick in 2013) has always maintained her innocence and has the backing of several attorneys who say her sentence was unjust

The killings began with the death of 21-year-old Robert Colvert, who was robbed, abducted and shot in late 1957. His body was later discovered on a country road.

Two months later authorities found many other bodies including those of Fugate's stepfather Marion Bartlett, 57 and his 35-year-old wife Velda, in an outbuilding.

Their two-year-old daughter, Betty Jean, had been clubbed to death with the butt of a gun and her body stuffed in a cardboard box. 

Fugate admitted taking $4 from Jensen's wallet just before he and a friend, Carol King, 16, were shot to death. One of the main factors in her conviction was that she was holding a shotgun at the time.

She was initially sentenced to life, but the term was later reduced to between 30 and 50 years. This meant she was eligible for parole in 1976 and was released after serving 17 years of her sentence because she had been considered a 'model prisoner'. 

Killer: Starkweather (pictured in a Converse County jail cell) was arrested following the two-month killing spree which lasted between December 1957 and January 1958. He was given the death penalty 

Sentence: After serving 17 months in prison, Starkweather was put to death in the electric chair in 1959 after being found guilty of killing Robert Jenson, the only murder he was tried for  

In 1996, she asked for a pardon saying the 'sentence did not fit the crime', also telling the newspaper: 'Everyone knows I never killed anyone.'

However the request was turned down. 

Mr Berry, a Lincoln attorney who published The Twelfth Victim earlier this year, claims Starkweather told investigators several times that Fugate was not involved in the slayings

But he changed his story just before they went to trial. 

Starkweather ultimately testified that Fugate was a willing participant in the murder spree.

'His lies convicted Caril,' Berry told the paper. 'We are convinced not only that she was treated illegally and unjustly, but was, in fact, innocent.'

He added that he will survey the candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state — the three offices that comprise the Pardons Board. This is so he can determine where voters stand on the request.

Attempts: Fugate (pictured in 1958) was released in 1976 after serving 17 years in prison. In 1996 she asked for a pardon on the grounds the sentence 'did not fit the crime'. Her plea however was rejected 

When Fugate was released, she is believed to have moved to Lansing, Michigan, where she worked as a janitor and medical technician. 

In 2007, Fugate married Fredrick Clair, a machinist who also worked as a weather observer for the National Weather Service. 

She now lives in Hillsdale, Michigan. Fugate's stepson states she suffered a series of strokes in her late 60s.

In August last year, she was critically injured in a car crash in Stryker, Ohio, that killed her husband. 

Starkweather's murders are the most notorious in Nebraska's history and have been depicted in films and TV programs.

The 1973 film Badlands starring Martin Sheen was based on the killing spree.
