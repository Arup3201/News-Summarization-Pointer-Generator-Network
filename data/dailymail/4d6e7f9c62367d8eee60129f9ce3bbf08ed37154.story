Tragic: Lucinda Woolley died after her horse reared up and bolted while she was riding down a country lane in August

One of Britain's top young riders suffered fatal head injuries after she fell from her horse when it reared up and bolted as she rode down a country lane, an inquest has heard.

Lucinda Woolley, 16, was ten minutes into her regular morning ride when her horse Alfie, which she rode in national British Eventing competitions, 'started jumping and took off at speed'.

Farm worker Thomas Hanmer, 22, who had seen her approaching, pulled his tractor to one side to allow Miss Woolley to pass, as he had done many times before, moments before the horse bolted.

Mr Hanmer ran over to Miss Woolley and checked her pulse and breathing as she lay unconscious in the road following the incident at 10.20am on August 7 at Little Wenham near Ipswich, Suffolk.

Her mother Julia, 48, arrived from the family home in nearby Chattisham before flying with her daughter in an air ambulance to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge.

The inquest in Ipswich heard how Miss Woolley, who was known as Lucy, underwent three hours of emergency surgery at the hospital’s specialist head injuries unit, but died the next day.

The teenager, who was waiting to hear her GCSE results, had been wearing a helmet at the time of the incident, the inquest heard.

Mr Hanmer, who has known the teenager’s family for several years, said in a statement read out at the inquest: 'I saw the horse and rider come out to the road and I knew it was her.

'Normally I just pull over and she passes me. I pulled up to let Lucy decide what to do and I noticed Lucy had pulled into a flat area which gave access to a field.

'She was having a problem with the horse. It was rearing up, it was rising but not too high - about a metre - it is not uncommon for a horse to do this. I expected her to get it under control.

'Suddenly the horse started jumping and took off at speed and raced away, she was leaving the saddle and going into the air. Then about 20 metres away I saw her fall from the horse.

'Seeing it happen I could not understand why the horse behaved in the way it did. The tractor had no trailer or external noise, just the engine. There was never a problem before.'

Greater Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said a CT scan at Addenbrooke’s Hospital had revealed she had a 'significant but isolated' head injury which was causing 'pressure inside the skull'.

He said: 'Because there was very early signs of fixed dilated pupils it’s fair to say that she would not be aware of what was going around her after the moment of impact and loss of consciousness.

'It’s very clear that it was an accident that led to the loss of someone who was highly regarded and much loved. My thoughts are very much with the family at this time.'

Dr Dean recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Tribute: At the time of her death, Miss Woolley's mother described her as 'beautiful and talented' with a 'passion for riding'

Mrs Woolley, a UK regional business manager at the Financial Times, described her daughter at the time of her death as 'beautiful and talented' with a 'passion for riding' and a keen sportswoman.

She was a pupil at £11,736-a-year Ipswich High School for girls, but was due to study A Levels in economics, geography, psychology and biology at £12,252 a year Ipswich School.

Miss Woolley, who was a member of the Essex and Suffolk Pony Club, had been riding since the age of three. She lived with parents Peter and Julia and her 18-year-old sister Charlotte.
