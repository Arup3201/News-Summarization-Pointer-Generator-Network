A Labor politician has been forced to reveal how he once helped the Sydney siege gunman plea for access to his children on Father’s Day.

NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson signed a letter to the Department of Family and Community Services on behalf of Man Haron Monis, a constituent in his western Sydney Blacktown electorate, in 2011.

Last week, Monis kept 18 terrified people hostage – shooting two dead – during a 16-hour siege in the Lindt café in Sydney’s Martin Place.

Mr Robertson has admitted to having assisted Monis when he was seeking visitation rights for his two children from his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal.

‘He met with staff in my Blacktown electorate office on one occasion regarding a family custody matter in August 2011. He was seeking a supervised visit with his children on Father’s Day,’ Mr Robertson said.

The politician helped despite the fact Monis had sent abusive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers between 2007 and 2009. 

He was convicted of sending the letters in 2013, and was also charged last year with 50 sexual offences, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act.

Monis painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege.

The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. 

Monis met his second-wife Pal in 2003 while he was working as a ‘psychic’. 

Ms Pal split with Monis – the father of her two children - in June 2011 after becoming increasingly disturbed by his aggressive and arrogant behaviour.

Shortly afterwards, Ms Pal told Campbelltown Court: ‘He's always saying to me that people are watching, people are hearing our conversations, especially when he started getting more into his Islamic activities, running the websites.'

 'Today I have forwarded a constituent file regarding Man Haron Monis to the Joint Commonwealth and New South Wales Review into the Martin Place siege.

He met with staff in my Blacktown electorate office on one occasion regarding a family custody matter in August 2011. He was seeking a supervised visit with his children on Father’s Day.

Man Monis was a resident in the Blacktown electorate and his request was forwarded in a routine manner to the Department of Family and Community Services. The letter included all relevant information, including that he was subject to an AVO and there were ongoing family court proceedings.

The request was refused by the Department in September 2011 and their response was forwarded to Man Monis.

My office subsequently received anonymous emails relating to Man Monis and his matter. Staff promptly reported these matters to the NSW Police.

I have forwarded these records to the Joint Inquiry to assist their work in completing a thorough review of all government interactions relating to Man Monis.

It is important that we learn from this terrible tragedy and the NSW Opposition supports the work of the Joint Inquiry as part of this process.'

She said he came and went 'randomly, whenever he pleased' until finally, on June 18, 2011, she told him to take all his things and not come over again.

'He was shocked, surprised and said "Are you sure?". I did see his face change. He became, like angry.

'I was worried he could just attack me, like become violent in that moment.'

Monis's third wife Amirah Droudis appeared outside court on Monday for a bail hearing after being charged with the murder of Ms Pal

Ms Pal was found dead, following a brutal attack after she was lured to the Werrington apartment where Monis was living in western Sydney on a Sunday afternoon, April 2, 2013.

Attacked in the stairwell by a 'woman in a black cape', Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times, doused with accelerant and then set alight as horrified neighbours watched on.

In October last year, Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis was charged with murder.

On December 12, both were released on bail to await trial.

Droudis, 35, faced Downing Centre Local Court on Monday as prosecutors attempted to revoke her bail. 

Prosecutors are seeking to place the wife of the Sydney gunman behind bars because of fresh video evidence, the court heard.
