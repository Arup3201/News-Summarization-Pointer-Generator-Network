U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry has made an unannounced trip to Pakistan to urge tough action against militant groups after Taliban gunmen massacred 134 children last month.

Kerry will meet Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Army
Chief Raheel Sharif to offer sympathy and to
galvanise Pakistan to combat militants who have used its
territory to attack neighbouring Afghanistan and India.

'We'll be very clear, as we have on previous occasions, that
the Pakistani fight against militarism has to root out all
militant groups in Pakistan,' a senior State Department official
told reporters before Kerry left Washington on Friday. 

Tough action: The U.S. Secretary of State will implore Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to drive out the Taliban

He plans
to call for more action to fight groups militant groups near Afghanistan, which the Pakistan's officials
have viewed as strategic assets in their rivalry
with India and as they jockey for influence in Afghanistan.

'Part of the secretary's core message will be to ensure that
actions are met with a real and sustained effort to constrain
the ability of the Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Afghan
Taliban, and other militants who pose a threat to regional
stability and to direct U.S. interests,' said the official.

Lashkar-e-Taiba fights Indian rule in Kashmir and is accused
of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed at least
163 people in India.

As for Haqqanis, the United States accuses Pakistan's
intelligence agency of supporting the network and using it as a
proxy in Afghanistan to gain leverage against the influence of
its arch-rival India in the country. Pakistan denies that.

Fears: Kerry insisted the Taliban's use of Pakistan as a strategic planning station is dangerous for the world 

Support: He said the U.S. appreciates the work Pakistan has done in Afghanistan against the militants

Pakistan's Taliban, blamed for the December 16 attack on the
military-run school in Peshawar, are distinct from the Afghan
Taliban but both share the goals of toppling their governments
and setting up a strict Islamist state across the region.

In addition to bilateral meetings with the prime minister
and army chief of staff, Kerry will co-chair the U.S.-Pakistan
strategic dialogue with Sartaj Aziz, the national security and
foreign affairs adviser to Nawaz Sharif.

Unannounced: Kerry made the trip after an international investment conference in Ahmedabad, India

Kerry, who made the trip after an international investment conference in Ahmedabad, will be joined by General Lloyd Austin, who heads the
U.S. Central Command which stretches across 18 nations in the
Middle East, Central and South Asia from Egypt to Pakistan.

A Pakistani source told Reuters earlier that the Pakistani
side would use the talks to ask Kerry to step up technical and
training assistance for its programme aimed at cracking down on
extremism following the Peshawar attack.
