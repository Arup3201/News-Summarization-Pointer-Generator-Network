Google has mapped the wreck of paddle steamer the Mary Celeste, which sank in 1864.

The wreck was catalogued as part of Google Street View using images from the Catlin Seaview Survey and allows computer users to browse the remains of the ship without getting wet.

The ruined vessel, also known as the Mary Celestia, rests some 55 feet below the waves off the coast of Bermuda complete with one of its huge wheels.

Google Street View lets users view the wreck as if they are diving at the site and gives a new perspective on a piece of U.S. history.

The Mary Celeste was a paddle steamer that sunk on a mission to run ammunition and supplies to the Confederate forces during the American Civil War - smuggling goods in and out of America.

The vessel was 225ft long and was built in Liverpool by William C Miller & Sons, according to Google Maps Mania.

Commissioned by Crenshaw and Company, a 
running company in the war, the steamer played an essential role in 
running goods between Bermuda, Nassau and England.

Members of the public can now take a tour of the historic wreck online, which rests 55 metres under the waves

The British-American merchant ship was discovered abandoned in 1982 with one lifeboat missing, but the weather was fine and its crew known to be capable

The ship carried cotton out of 
Wilmington, North Carolina to Bermuda, returning with war supplies and 
food. Is thought to have made eight intrepid trips before it sank in 
1864.

The Mary Celeste left port in Bermuda on September 14 1864 full of meat, rides and ammunition, bound for Wilmington.

But the steamer never reached its destination.

It is thought that the ship hit a reef and the seamen escaped with their lives, apart from the ship's cook who went back to reclaim his possessions.

The South West Breaker has also been mapped as part of Google's vast project. The reef in Bermuda is not a coral or rock formation but made from fossilised prehistoric worms. The structure is incredibly strong and can easily withstand the strong winter storms

The wreckage of the famous vessel lies 600 yards off the south coast of Bermuda and is popular with divers.

As part of Google's Street View project, the search giant has also mapped other famous diving sites around the world and the images capture, divers, colourful fish and seals as well as incredible tropical reefs.
