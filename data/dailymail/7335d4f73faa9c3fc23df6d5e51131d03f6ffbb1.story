Gliding down the slopes in her tiny ski gear, this talented two-year-old girl has already mastered the art of skiing. Aurora Burns from Alaska, is now more at home on a snowy mountainside than inside a sandpit.

Her parents, Cody Burns, 29, and Andrea Peterson, 34, believe their daughter is destined to take off.

Cody, a ski patrol night supervisor, says: 'Aurora has been skiing since she was in the womb as Andrea was still keen to ski throughout her pregnancy, and we were showing her ski films as soon as she arrived.

'She was born in October 2012, so she has known snow her entire life.'

Aurora, who began walking at nine months, started skiing on her own when she was aged 18 months old.

Before the talented toddler was let loose on a ski slope, her parents gave her a pair of plastic skis to wear around the house.

Cody, who has been skiing for 26 years, and Andrea, a skier of 29 years, would strap their daughter into the skis and hold her up, then the ski-savvy parents would assist Aurora as she moved around indoors.

Aurora is already the proud owner of five of her very own skis, in sizes ranging from 80cm to 140cm

Cody says: 'Skiing is part of everyday life for her and she is a total natural.

'The best thing is that she is absolutely in love with it! She is extremely excited to ski this winter.

'Andrea and I are thrilled that Aurora can ski so well and that she loves the snow so much.

'The only problem we have faced on the slopes is when Aurora throws a fit whenever it's time to go inside. She would happily play outside in the snow all day long!'

Her collection includes race skis, powder skis, park skis, cross country skis, and mountain skis.

Andrea, who runs her own massage business, says: 'I am extremely proud of our little girl.

'I look forward to enjoying this with her as she continues to grow.'

Skiing mostly on beginner slopes, this winter Aurora will be attempting intermediate runs in the Alyeska Resort in Girdwood, Alaska.

Speaking about Aurora's safety, Cody says: 'Children have such a small low centre of gravity and skis help balance, and we're right there and ready to catch if she falls.

'It's normal to have a few falls when learning to ski, as long as she knows it's okay to just get back up.

'On average, Aurora can probably ski about as fast as you can run, so around 5mph.

'People are always stoked to see her skiing at such a young age and she always gets high fives from people.

'We hope that Aurora will continue to grow and love skiing, snow, and living in the mountains as much as her parents do.

'I hope that she will continue to develop her skills and gain a healthy respect for the mountains.

'It would be our dream for her to be a ski guide, and then she could take us to some really cool places to do what we love as a family.

'Who knows, maybe one day she could even be an Olympic skier!'
