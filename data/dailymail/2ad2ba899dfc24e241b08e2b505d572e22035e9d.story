Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United will not make Radamel Falcao's move permanent at the end of the season and questioned the effectiveness of his strike partnership with Robin van Persie after Sunday's 1-1 draw with West Ham.

Louis van Gaal's side had defensive midfielder Daley Blind to thank after his 93rd minute equaliser earned a point against The Hammers in an encounter where  Van Persie and  Falcao stuttered throughout.

And Carragher feels United's woes stem from the array of attacking players manager Van Gaal spent millions on accumulating after taking the reigns at Old Trafford last year.

'I don't see Falcao staying, it's something they have to address,' Carragher said on Sky Sports after the game. 'I can't believe (James) Wilson didn't come on at some stage of the game. Falcao and Van Persie lack movement and I don't think this is a partnership that's working.

'Everyone talks about United and that they need a centre-back - they have one of the best defensive records in the league, although (David) De Gea is part of that, but that's the reason you pay him.

'The problems are at the other end of the pitch.'

Carragher's co-pundit, ex Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke, is undecided on whether he thinks Falcao should remain beyond this season.

'The jury is still out on Falcao,' Yorke explained. 'He had a great opportunity today but it hasn’t materialised at this point of time, maybe the system is the issue and not the actual players.'

Former Liverpool defender Carragher also queried Van Gaal's decision to drop captain Wayne Rooney into midfield - away from his traditional role in attack.

'Rooney's position is not right, he was playing as a defensive midfield player,' Carragher said. 'Why is he (Van Gaal) not putting Rooney up off the front, with two strikers showing such a lack of movement? They had less touches today than De Gea.'

United fell behind to West Ham after Cheikhou Kouyate's brilliant finish four minutes into the second half.

But Van Gaal rolled the dice by throwing on Marouane Fellaini on 72 as his side turned to a long ball style and in the dying moments, Blind volleyed in Angel Di Maria's cross.

Carragher commended the character in United's team and Van Gaal's decision to ditch his regular possession style and go direct in search of a goal.

'It's not luck,' Carragher insisted. 'United have done it too often over the years. They've done it again today. How many times have we seen United and they haven't played well and they've still got a result?

David de Gea made a number of fine saves before West Ham opened the scoring in the 49th minute 

'He put Fellaini on and went long. In the past United wouldn't have done that but I admire that. You talk about principles, sometimes you have to change them when it's not working and credit to Van Gaal, he did.' 

Carragher later queried what United's best formation is on his Kicca account.

'United are notorious for playing wingers & in Januzai, Valencia, Young & Di Maria they have players who can fill those roles but, when a foreign manager comes in especially he will have his own ideas rather than adhere to the club's traditions,' Carragher wrote. 'That's something they may have to get used to now & in the future.'
