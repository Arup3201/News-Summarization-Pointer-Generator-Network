On the flip chart outside England’s dressing room in Miami last week, Roy Hodgson had made it clear that the players were not to discuss the strengths of individual Italians.

Gianluigi Buffon, one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game, was off limits. So, too, was former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli. The same rule applied to Andrea Pirlo.

During routine interviews after England’s 0-0 draw with Honduras in the Sun Life Stadium, Jordan Henderson, Phil Jagielka, Joe Hart, Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson were all on message. On Saturday, in the Arena Amazonia, Henderson will be obliged to carry out a different set of instructions on behalf of the England team. He must keep Pirlo quiet.

Sitting deep in midfield alongside captain Steven Gerrard, the plan is for Henderson to pounce on Pirlo the moment the Italian maestro is in possession of the ball.

England’s opening match of the 2014 World Cup has become the biggest game of Henderson’s short international career.

Pirlo is a human carousel, constantly dictating speed and tempo for his team as he attempts to finish his career with the Azzurri by winning his second World Cup.

When the ball arrives at his feet, he is capable of switching the emphasis of Italy’s attack in a flash or fizzing the ball into a team-mate.

With that in mind, Hodgson will attempt to cut off the supply line by detailing Wayne Rooney to drop into a deeper position the moment England lose possession.

Hodgson wants to reduce the temptation for Italy’s defenders - Matteo Darmian, Giorgio Chiellini, Gabriel Paletta and Andrea Baragli - to keep feeding Pirlo.

When they can find the Italian maestro, it will be Henderson’s job to stop him twisting in the centre of the pitch and distributing those penetrating through balls.

Earlier this week it is believed that Jack Wilshere was asked to play the ‘Pirlo role’ in training a number of times to test Henderson’s flexibility and suitability to the role of keeping the Italian quiet.

If Henderson can do a number on Pirlo, then England’s chances of winning their opening group game will be dramatically enhanced.

It is a big night for the Liverpool midfielder, but he will have the security blanket of Gerrard alongside him. Together they are a formidable presence.

‘I can only do my best when I am called upon and make sure that I train hard,’ said Henderson.

‘I have been preparing myself well and if I do play I will make sure I give everything I have got.

‘We are a very close group and we want to do well.’

In the build-up, Hodgson’s training sessions at England’s military training base in Rio de Janeiro have been short but intense.

He has taken many of the sessions himself because his assistant manager Ray Lewington has had a knee operation.

It is there that Hodgson has worked on attacking and defensive duties with his team as the countdown continues to this testing opener.

‘It benefits me to have been playing different roles for Liverpool and England,’ added Henderson.

‘I have gone through some different experiences but it has been nice to be playing in the middle for a lot of the season.

‘Steven Gerrard has been a big influence. He leads on the pitch, or sets an example to all of us on or off the pitch by talking to players and encouraging them.

‘He is a top player and he is a top person as well.’

On Saturday, Henderson will have the chance to come out on top.
