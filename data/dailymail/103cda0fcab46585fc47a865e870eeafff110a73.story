An extraordinary gun fight in Brazil in which an off-duty policeman holding a child exchanged fire with two bandits has been caught on camera.

The dramatic scene unfolded in a store in Belo Horizonte and ended with the two alleged bandits fleeing.

Security camera footage of the incident begins with the two suspects walking into the store in Contagem, a district in the city, and talking to the doorman. 

An extraordinary gun fight in Brazil has been caught on camera. It involves two armed suspects, one in a dark top, the other in a white top and baseball cap - and an off-duty policeman holding a child (right) 

After the two suspects talk to the store clerk, the policeman realises they are intent on committing a crime and draws a gun as he steps away from them

The two suspects dodge the policeman's shots and run further inside the store

A few words are exchanged, then the officer reaches for his gun and spins around with the child in his arms.

The suspects, one wearing a white T-shirt and the other a dark top,  sprint further inside the shop, underneath the camera. At this point it doesn't appear that either has produced a weapon.

As they run off the policeman takes cover on the pavement behind a pillar. After peeking around it he moves quickly out of shot.

Then the bandit in the white T-shirt rushes out and points a gun in the direction the off-duty policeman left in, before fleeing the scene.

The other man follows shortly afterwards.

Police said that the attempted robbery took place at around 4pm on Avenida José Faria da Rocha.

No one was injured in the shootout. The suspects are still at large, Em.com reported.

After a few seconds the man in the white T-shirt produces a gun and points it in the direction of the policeman, before fleeing the scene with his accomplice
