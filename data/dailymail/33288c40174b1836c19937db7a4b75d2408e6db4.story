It's a new theory that could shatter everything you thought you knew about The Simpsons.

Die-hard fans of the satirical cartoon have proposed that Homer Simpson never awoke from a coma he fell into during an episode in 1993 and that everything that occurred on the series after that happened inside Homer's head.

While seeming outlandish on the surface, the theory is gaining a lot of traction in online The Simpsons forums, with even the most devout of followers declaring they believe it.

The theory lays claim to why the characters never age, and how the show moved from mundane episodes in the early 90s, such as Bart cheating on an IQ test, to plots that saw Mr. Burns capturing the Loch Ness Monster.

Oh hey: In the 1992 episode Homer the Heretic, Mr Simpson has a conversation with God, who tells him he will die in six months time

The concept was put forward by Reddit user Hardtopickaname, who proposes the arc starts in the 1992 episode 'Homer the Heretic'.

In it, Homer ponders the meaning of life during a conversation with God.

He insists he can't wait until he's dead to find out, to which God says: 'You can't wait six months?'

Six months later, in April 1993 episode 'So It’s Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show', Homer is crushed by a vending machine after an April Fool's prank by Bart goes wrong.

He is taken to hospital in a coma.

Comatose: Homer ends up in hospital in an April 1993 episode after one of Bart's pranks goes awry

Theory: Every episode since this one is a dream from inside Homer's head

Watch full explanation of the theory 

At the end of the episode, Homer abruptly awakes from the coma, strangling Bart, and then the credits roll.

'I propose that Homer didn’t actually wake up from his coma. He is still in a vegetative state and every single Simpsons episode afterwards is in Homer’s imagination,' the Reddit user theorizes.

'Homer remembers Bart, Lisa, and Maggie as 10, 8, and 1 year old, so they will always appear that way in his dreams.'

The theory claims the show, which started simply as a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of middle-class America, became radically different from 1993.

There was Homer going into space, a look-into-the-future where Lisa was President, and an episode devoted almost entirely to Moe's 100-year-old bar rag, which turns out to be his best friend.

Outlandish: The theory claims the show became more 'zany' after the coma episode in 1993, with episodes such as Homer going into space

It also claims to show how a never-ending stream of celebrities came to come in contact with the Simpsons over the years.

This is clearly Homer’s imagination running wild. 

'With no real world restrictions, Homer’s mind is able to dream up scenarios of him and his family in fantasies involving him winning a Grammy, his father fighting his boss for buried WW2 treasure, his wife getting breast implants, his infant daughter saving him from drowning, etc.'

Creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, who is typically quite vocal about his show, is yet to comment on the theory, The Huffington Post reported.
