Brian Havill is the England and Wales Cricket Board's new acting chief executive, replacing the retiring David Collier.

The ECB announced last weekend that Collier is to retire, and on Wednesday confirmed Havill - currently also the governing body's finance director and company secretary - will fulfill the chief executive's role.

Collier, 59, was scheduled to leave at the end of the current season after a decade in his position.

But an ECB press release said of Havill: 'His appointment allows retiring CEO David Collier the time to conclude specific projects for both ECB and the International Cricket Council.'

Surreyâ€™s Richard Gould, son of former 
Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould, had been a strong favourite to replace 
Collier, before Havill was confirmed as his successor.

Havill, the governing body's finance director and company secretary, started at the ECB in August 2000.

Between 2008 and 2013 he also served on the council of the Lawn Tennis Association on a voluntary basis.
