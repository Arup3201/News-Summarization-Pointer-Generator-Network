Party leader Nick Clegg is being urged to protect the party's existing seats rather than trying to compete as a national force

The Liberal Democrats could be left with no women MPs after the next election unless they change tack now, Nick Clegg has been warned.

Senior figures are urging Mr Clegg to adopt a ‘fortress strategy’ to protect the party’s existing seats, rather than trying to continue to compete as a national force.

One Lib Dem member of the Government told the Daily Mail that the party, which is languishing in fourth place in the opinion polls, is on course to lose half its seats, with female MPs disproportionately affected.

‘You can see how 30 colleagues can survive, but the other 27? It’s very difficult,’ he said.

‘We need a fortress strategy right now. If it’s a choice between employing a local campaigner on £20,000 or spending the money on focus grouping a new national policy we should be doing the former. But at the moment we’re not.

‘Everyone knows we haven’t got enough women but the situation could be far worse after next year. If we don’t start to do something about it now we could be left with none.’

The warning is a fresh blow to Mr Clegg who is already reeling from criticism of his handling of sex scandals involving the party’s former chief executive Lord Rennard and Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock.

Several disgusted activists have urged women to abandon the party in protest at the leadership’s failure to take tougher action against Lord Rennard over claims he made unwanted sexual advances against women. Mr Clegg has so far proved unable to extract even an apology from the peer, who denies wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the party unless his membership is reinstated.

Five of the Lib Dems’ seven women MPs have majorities of around 2,000 or less, suggesting they will be wiped out by the national swing against the party which has taken place since it entered coalition with the Conservatives.

Only international development minister Lynne Featherstone, with a majority of just under 8,000, has a notionally safe seat, although she is likely to face a fierce battle to survive against Labour in her north London constituency.

Equalities Minister Jo Swinson, who has a majority of just over 2,000, is being urged to do the ‘chicken run’ from East Dunbartonshire, in Scotland, to the relatively safety of Bath, where veteran chief whip Don Foster is standing down.

Miss Swinson, seen as a rising star, is married to Chippenham Lib Dem Duncan Hames, whose constituency neighbours bath. The couple have just had a baby and colleagues are suggesting she could present the relocation as being for family reasons.

Until recently the Lib Dem hierarchy believed it could hold on to at least 45 of its 57 seats. Aides to Mr Clegg believed the party would receive some credit for its part in the coalition’s economic policies. But despite the economic recovery the Lib Dems remain anchored at just 10 per cent in the opinion polls.

The call for a ‘fortress strategy’ is the first sign of panic in senior Lib Dem ranks about the party’s electoral plight.

Although the polls suggest the party could play a role in another coalition after the next election, senior figures believe its role would be greatly diminished.

One source said: ‘The polls still show we can hold the balance of power. But holding the balance with25 or 30 MPs, how much influence are we going to have in any new coalition? We’re not going to be able to demand four Cabinet ministers, that’s for sure.’
