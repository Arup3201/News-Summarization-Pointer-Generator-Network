The battle between Bethenny Frankel and Jason Hoppy for custody of their young daughter Bryn concluded today - with the pair agreeing to both share parental duties.

The Skinnygirl millionairess, 43, accused her 42-year-old estranged husband of hacking into her personal email and says he reportedly 'sought to obsessively control her every move through their four-year-old daughter', as the pair fought over custody in court last week.

But today, Bernard Clair, Hoppy’s attorney, confirmed that the custody part of the divorce case has been settled, stating: 'My client is delighted that this custody dispute has been resolved; that his co-parenting status has been acknowledged; that the parties’ child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents; and most importantly, that his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high profile courtroom battle.

'She's thrilled this has settled': Bethenny Frankel and ex Jason Hoppy have finally settled their ongoing custody dispute over four-year-old daughter Bryn - pictured here with her mom in Soho, New York on Wednesday - agreeing to share parenting duties

'Jason 
wishes Bethenny only the best of luck, and he looks forward to sharing 
with her all of the joyous occasions, milestones, and blessings that 
will be coming up in his daughter’s future.'

Mr. Clair also said that 
the specific terms of the settlement are confidential.

It comes amid reports on Radar Online that Frankel testified she once threw water over a sleeping Hoppy, and also told the court: 'He would sit with Bryn and look over and say ... "You be the princess, I’ll be the prince, Mommy will be the witch."'

Changing it up: On the same day, Bethenny was seen stepping out with a different outfit on later in the day

It got nasty: In the court case, Frankel recalled how Hoppy made their daughter 'start crying' on May 8 after a school party

In addition Frankel recalled how Hoppy made their daughter 'start crying' on May 8 after a school party. Frankel claims he said to Bryn: 'You don’t want to go with Mommy, right? You want to be with me.'

Although
 their divorce is still ongoing, the custody agreement was reached just 
days after it threatened to spill over into a bitter and hate-fuelled 
row with damaging allegations made in a New York courtroom.

Frankel hired lawyer Allan Mayefsky, who repped Katie Holmes in her split from Tom Cruise.

In opening 
comments last week, Mayefsky claimed the Bravo star's husband went 'to 
war' once their union crumbled in 2012, saying: 'He threatened to 
destroy her.

'He had her followed and spied on along with their daughter. He hacked into her most private personal email.'

​'​He has 
consciously placed his desire for revenge … over the best interests of 
this family and particularly the child,' Mayefsky concluded.​ ​'He has 
sought to obsessively control their every move through their daughte​r.'

Mayefsky said his client is a 'very, very involved mother' whose success will benefit the child.

While Bethenny had been insisting on primary custody and sole decision-making authority for Bryn, Jason ​was asking for shared custody.

While under
 attack, Jason showed no emotion. His attorney Clair, who has 
also repped Simon Cowell's girlfriend and mother of his baby son, Lauren Silverman, also accused 
the reality TV star and businesswoman of wanting to get even.

One
 of the examples mentioned was how Bethenny allegedly stripped their 
shared condo on Hudson Street when she vacated it earlier this year.

'The clothes were gone, the favorite stuffed animals gone, the favorite dollhouse gone,' Clair said.

He argued 
the change made Bryn upset. When her father went to cook her a meal to 
calm her nerves, he said the kitchen was almost empty.

 love: Bethenny and Jason enjoyed a break in St. Barts after tying the

'He
 found that every single utensil had been taken but replaced with 
plastic knives, forks and spoons like you would pick up from a takeout 
place. One pot was left,' Clair said.

Clair
 also said Frankel used 'the child as a prop … in the pursuit of her own
 career and her own brand.' He said she 'embarked on a secret endeavor 
to have a children’s book published' this coming September about Bryn’s 
life.

'Ms.
 Frankel even arranged for the illustrator to come to her home to follow
 this child around so that every likeness and every sense of the child 
could be presented,' Clair said. 'And that’s not all: This children’s 
book has the Skinnygirl logo, Skinnygirl being the brand of Ms. Frankel,
 throughout its pages.'

According to RadarOnline, Bethenny was in 'tears' while on the stand, claiming her estranged husband said she was 'disgusting.'

'If you don’t want to be with me and you’re ending this marriage, I want nothing to do with you ever again. I’m going to destroy you,' she revealed Hoppy had told her.

She added that Jason said, 'You’re already losing fans. I’m going to ruin you' and also saying, 'You’re dead to me. I want nothing to do with you. You think I want to be with you on the holidays? You’re a piece of s***. You’re garbage. You have no idea what I’ve got on you.'

Bethenny filed for divorce from Jason 16 months ago.

Jason had 
reportedly been hoping to come to an out-of-court deal with his 
estranged wife, who sold her Skinnygirl alcohol brand to Beam Global for
 an estimated $39m with a similar amount promised if the brand hit 
certain sales targets. But the source said Bethanny is refusing to 
settle.

'Bethenny
 sat outside the courtroom and made notes on what looked like a script 
or a book draft,' an eyewitness told RadarOnline of the former talk show
 host's appearance on Thursday morning.

No, she's mine: Jason, 42, has been equally adamant about his custody right to Bryn as the couple's bitter divorce wrangle comes to a head after 16 months

'There were no tears or emotions. Both Bethenny and Jason looked very somber.'

In June 2010, the celebrity starred in the Bravo reality TV show Bethenny Getting Married, which documented her engagement to Jason, their marriage on March 28, 2010, and the birth of their daughter two months later.

The brunette, whose show Bethenny was cancelled by Fox after just one season, is finding solace in the arms of her new beau, Michael Cerrusi.

She has been dating the beefy 34-year-old son of a prominent New York attorney since the beginning of the year.
