It seems everything is falling into place for Fabio Borini after the Liverpool striker asked model girlfriend Erin O'Neill to marry him, and got a resounding 'yes' in return.

The model took to Twitter to spread the news, posting photos of the pair hugging and looking teary eyed in Times Square, with the message: 'I said YES'.

It is sure to leave plenty jealous, given the extravagant diamond ring Borini gave to O'Neill.

Couple: The pair met when O'Neill went for a tour of Anfield with her sister

Borini is preparing to return to Anfield for next season after a year on loan at the Stadium of Light with Sunderland.

There, the forward gave a compelling account of himself, scoring 10 goals in 40 appearances throughout the season.

In doing so, the 23-year-old was instrumental in Sunderland surviving relegation to the Championship.

'My
 sister was going on a tour of Anfield and said: "Why don't you come 
with us?" I didn't really feel like it but they persuaded me and said 
they were going to pick up someone else,' Erin O'Neill told the Liverpool Echo.

'Luckily,
 because I'd felt terrible for about 10 days, I thought I'd make a bit 
of an effort so I washed my hair, put on some make-up and wore something
 nice to make myself feel better.

'When I got in the car, I was glad I did.'
