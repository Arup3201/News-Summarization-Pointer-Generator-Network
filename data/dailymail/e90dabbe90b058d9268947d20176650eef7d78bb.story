An FBI video released for the first time shows two Iraqi refugees packing up rocket launchers, machine guns and other heavy weapons to ship back to al-Qaeda terrorists fighting Americans in their homeland.

But this footage wasn't shot in the Middle East - it's from Bowling Green, Kentucky.

Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32 and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, were filmed handling the weapons at a storage locker in 2011 as part of an FBI sting.

The weapons were all harmless, rendered inert before they were handed over. An undercover informant had supplied them to the militants.

The video was released to ABC News and shown for the first time since the two were arrested in May 2011.

Both
Alwan and Hammadi were allowed into the country as refugees after 
claiming they were persecuted in Iraq. However, investigators later 
discovered that both men had been arrested by U.S. forces in Iraq over 
suspicions that they were insurgents.

Alwan and Hammadi both bragged during a federal sting that they had fought against American soldiers.

Alwan
boasted that he'd built at least a dozen bombs in Iraq and had killed 
U.S. troops with a sniper rifle - claiming that he 'had them for lunch 
and dinner.'

ABC News 
reports that Alwan and Hammadi, who were arrested in May 2011 and later 
convicted on terrorism charges, are just two of potentially 'dozens' of 
Iraqi insurgents living in America as 'refugees.'

FBI agents are now working around the clock to dust every insurgent bomb 
recovered in Iraq for fingerprints to check them against the database of 
70,000 Iraqi refugees who settled here.

Officials say a flawed background check may have allowed many insurgents and terrorists who fought against coalition troops to slip through the crack - and into the United States.

Gregory Carl, director of the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, told ABC News that his lab has identified 'dozens' of Iraqi refugees whose fingerprints potentially match the prints found on IEDs.

'I
wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that. And these are 
trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United 
States,'  Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on
Homeland Security, told ABC.

'And quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.'

Alwan was especially happy to see the Stinger missile launcher (pictured) because the anti-aircraft weapons are in short supply among Iraqi insurgents

Both Alwan and Hammadi had been arrested and fingerprinted in Iraq by American soldiers, ABC reports.

Despite this - a background check to let them in the country came back 'clean.'

When the men were arrested they were living in public housing and collecting government assistance checks in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

In 2012, nearly a year after the FBI arrested the two suspects after working with an undercover informant to ship dummy weapons to al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center discovered Alwan's fingerprints on a bomb recovered in Iraq in 2005.

The print was on a cordless phone base station that had been attached to 'three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires' that U.S. troops had discovered in Bayji on a patrol.

Alwan had drawn a model for a similar explosive for the undercover informant.

He even had talked about tracking down a U.S. Army officer who had given Alwan trouble when he was fighting the Americans in Iraq.
