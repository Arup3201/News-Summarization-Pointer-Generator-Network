Outspoken: Judge Jamie Tabor, pictured, told the female gang member not to get pregnant again after she lost her unborn child

A judge told an 18-year-old girl not to get pregnant again after she breached a community order because she lost her unborn child

Sophie Duckett was sentenced to an 18-month community order in August for repeatedly punching a vulnerable young man in the face and stealing his Blackberry.

However, she breached the unpaid work order because she suffered a miscarriage.

His Honour Judge Jamie Tabor QC heard on Friday that Sophie Duckett was in breach of her community order.

The judge said: 'Do not get pregnant again.'

Duckett from Gloucester joined in a gang attack on 20-year-old Robert Paxman at Greyfriars on February 25, after one of the group lured the victim to the scene.

The yobs took Mr Paxman's BMX bike and his Blackberry after giving him a beating.

The victim was so traumatised, he moved away from the city.

On August 6, prosecuting barrister Julian Kesner told Gloucester Crown Court: 'This defendant played a significant role in this group attack on a vulnerable young man who has a speech impediment and learning difficulties.

'When the victim's phone rang one of the gang grabbed it and handed it to this defendant.

'The defendant then punched Mr Paxman around the face.

'The victim suffered a bloody nose, split lip, torn ear and was generally given a nasty going over.

'He was shaken and started to cry and in a victim's statement he said that he has moved out of Gloucester.'

Duckett was sentenced to an 18-month 
community order with supervision, 180 hours of unpaid work and ordered 
to pay £100 compensation to her victim.

Judge Tabor told Duckett, at the time: 'You have had a chaotic life, a tough life especially as a child, and you need some stability.

'But it was a nasty, cowardly and bullying attack and I very nearly sent you to prison today.'

Yesterday the judge added seven extra hours to her unpaid work total to mark the breach.

The judge has previously gained media attention for his controversial rulings.

In September, he refused to lift a seven-year restraining order imposed by a wife on her husband, even though they couple wanted to get back together.

Natalie Nash, 23, applied to Gloucester Crown Court to lift the order on her husband Daniel, 24.

Despite Mrs Nash giving evidence that she wanted her husband back, Judge Jamie Tabor QC declined.

Earlier that month, the judge let a 21-year-old serial thief walk free from court despite admitting his 70th crime.

Judge Tabor sentenced Joshua Bennetts to a five-month overnight curfew and said: ‘I don’t know what is going to stop you offending.'
