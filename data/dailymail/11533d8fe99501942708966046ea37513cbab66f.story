With two young children, a beautiful home in leafy Surrey and a thriving business, Jane Wall-Budden seemed to have it all.

Like so many of her contemporaries, however, the 30-year-old also had a cashflow problem. With her business, making designer cot bumpers for babies, growing quickly, she needed liquidity to keep up the momentum while retaining the family’s comfortable lifestyle.

For most people this would entail going to see the bank manager, cap in hand, to beg for a loan. Jane, however, opted for a different tack.

Financial sense: Jane Wall-Budden pawned a Cartier and a Rolex that were just sat in her drawer

Tucked away at her Byfleet home were two expensive watches, a Cartier and a Rolex, which she promptly took to the local pawnbrokers and walked out with a £3,000 loan.

'I needed a cash injection to invest in a new product, which I felt would market well,' she says. 'It made good business sense, but the bank just saw me as a little cottage industry and wasn't interested.

'Frankly, pawning these watches - which I just kept in a bedside drawer - was the only way I could get my hands on a lump sum. I would say to anyone who was in the same position and had something lying around that wasn’t of huge personal value to do the same.'

It is a stark change from the traditional image of pawnbrokers' clients: impoverished strugglers hocking the family silver for cash to buy shoes for the children. In this day and age, they are more likely to be struggling to pay the private school fees.

For Jane is far from alone. Middle-class families are turning to pawnbrokers like never before. Why? Well, David Braithwaite, from Citrus Financial Management, says there are certain advantages to using a pawnbroker.

'It is probably cheaper than something like a payday loan,' he says. 'But the big advantage of a pawnbroker is that you do not have to go through normal credit checks, like you would if you were applying for a bank loan or credit card.

'So it can be viewed as a simpler, no questions asked way of getting money. And you get it very quickly as well.'

 'Although I am a stay-at-home mum, with careful budgeting I'm confident I can raise the money to get them back'

A pawnbroker typically lends up to 50 per cent of the value of an item for six months. The customer then repays the loan plus interest, which tends to be between 2 and 7 per cent (compared with an average 19.5 per cent on a bank overdraft and 17.3 per cent on a credit card).

There is, of course, a catch. If the customer is unable to pay back the pawnbroker within the time stipulated in the contract, the pawnbroker takes possession and sells the items to recoup the value of the loan and interest.

For entrepreneurial types in particular, however, it is a risk worth taking.

In 1971, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg famously raised cash to launch her fledgling wrap-dress business by pawning her diamond ring. The dress became her signature and, today, her business is a multi-million-dollar corporation.

And today, with banks offering very few traditional-style loans, luxury pawnbroking is a growth industry.

Take James Constantinou, 45, who runs Prestige Pawnbrokers in Weybridge, Surrey. Originally a property developer, he found himself living in an upmarket area, surrounded by successful businessmen and professional footballers in million-pound houses.

However, while many of the middle class locals were asset rich, they were often cash poor. Ideal clients for a pawnbroker, then, and his highly lucrative business was born.

Mr Constantinou's premises are discreet and plain, with a workmanlike counter and sofas that make it resemble a bank more than anything else. The secure locked units behind the scenes, however, are packed with expensive jewellery, designer handbags and dresses.

Elsewhere, in underground vaults, he is safeguarding rare books and paintings, while secure garages in a different location store row upon row of prestige cars which have been pawned by their owners for ready cash.

Mr Constantinou, who sold property interests to set up his business in 2009, during the early months of the recession, says: 'I knew people living in million-pound houses with Ferraris on the drive who were short on funds - people who had built up wealth in cars and fine paintings but couldn't use them as collateral at the bank.

Ring recycle

The most popular pawn items are gold rings, according to the National Pawnbrokers' Association

'They come in here and within ten minutes they can walk out with a large amount of cash or a bank draft.'

It is not just about high-rolling businessmen hocking Picassos and Lamborghinis, however. Over recent years, women have become just as much a mainstay of his pawn- broking business.

Lorraine Giacomelli, 41, from Richmond in South-West London, turned to a pawnbroker when she was struggling to pay for the upkeep of her home last year.

'Money has been tight since I got divorced,' says Lorraine, a mother of two, 'and when my bathroom flooded I didn't have the funds to fix it. I wasn't covered by my insurance, and while I could have got a loan or used a credit card, I didn’t want to be in debt - which is why I didn’t ask my ex-husband either.

But he had been very generous while we were married and a friend pointed out that I probably had thousands of pounds-worth of goods tucked away that I could pawn. So I rooted through my wardrobe and found a pair of £1,000 Christian Louboutin shoes, a £2,000 Chanel handbag and a Hermès bag that had originally cost £17,000.

'At the pawnbrokers I was offered £4,000 for the lot, at a monthly interest of 5 per cent. The important thing was that it was enough to fix my bathroom.

'Although I am a stay-at-home mum, with careful budgeting I'm confident I can raise the money to get them back - and if I don’t and I lose the bags and shoes, I won’t be totally heartbroken.

'That's why it's a win-win situation. I got the money I needed and I’m not left in debt in real terms. I felt quite proud that I didn’t have to ask anyone for money.'

Earlier this year, she went back and pawned a Cartier watch worth £4,000 for £1,000, to raise money to take her children on holiday.

As Phil Diaper, director of the national pawnbroker chain Suttons & Robertsons, puts it: 'It's a middle-class thing, with people needing money for school fees or tax bills.'

But anyone tempted should heed Lorraine’s words of warning.

'Only get what you need and make sure that you’re going to be able to get the money to get that back if it really means something,' she says. 'The last thing you want to do is lose it.'
