Britain had a new boxing hero today after Anthony Joshua punched his way to glory with an Olympic gold.

London boy Joshua turned round a 
three-point deficit to level it after all three rounds and won on count back of the number of punches won.

He was so excited about his victory he accidentally swore on BBC television as he was being interviewed after beating 2008 champion Roberto Cammarelle.

He told reporter Gary Richardson: 'My heart's 
still pumping with f****** adrenalin. Sorry. I've done it again...pulled
it out of the bag. This is much more than a gold medal, I'm proud to 
have it round m neck.Sunday is a holy day, and I was blessed.'

Among those cheering him on were London 2012 champion rowers Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins and history-making Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams.

The roof almost came off the ExCeL 
arena as 10,000 largely local fans celebrated a victory for 
British boxing and Team GB's 29th gold medal.

An exhausted but elated Joshua, a strapping 6ft 6in, 17-stone 
super-heavyweight, raised his hands in triumph while his cornermen and 
coach went wild along with the crowd.

There had been a delay in announcing the verdict after the Italian's corner challenged the result, but this was quickly dismissed.

Joshua's triumph follows in the footsteps of the last British heavyweight Olympic champion Audley Harrison who won in 2000 at Sydney.

His name is now added to the Olympic fighters who then went on to become heavyweight and legends including  champions  Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Lennox Lewis and current world champion Wladimir Klitschko.

Joshua, who wrapped a union jack flag
around his shoulders, rounded off Britain's biggest  
medal haul at a Games for over 100 years in the most dramatic fashion.

He
blazed out for the final round against Italy's reigning champion 
Roberto Cammarelle, and after the pair had exchanged bombs for three 
minutes, the decision for Joshua - after an 18-18 draw - brought the 
house down.
