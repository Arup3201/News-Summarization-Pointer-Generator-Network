A five-year-old boy tested positive for cocaine after his parents allegedly left him with a half-pound bag of the substance during a drug deal.

Marco Cuevas, 31, and his pregnant wife Sandy, 29, were arrested in California when police allegedly caught them selling drugs from their car.

After the couple, who have three children, were arrested, their infant son was found in the back seat next to an enormous bag of cocaine.

Shockingly, preliminary tests showed the boy had a significant level of cocaine in his system. 

Mr Cuevas was carrying a further two ounces of cocaine while Mrs Cuevas, who is said to be seven months pregnant, had $10,000 cash on her person when they were arrested on Friday, KTLA reported.

A search on the family's home in Sylmar uncovered more drugs and weapons, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's office.

Officers seized marijuana, pills, $75,000, 16 guns and nearly 3,000 rounds of ammunition.

And their three children were taken into protective custody.

Children: The couple are said to have three children who have all been taken into protective custody

Charges: Mrs Cuevas has been released home (pictured) on bail while her husband is held on a $1m bond

Mr Cuevas, who has a history of drug convictions, is now being held in custody with his bail set at $1,000,000.

He is charged with selling cocaine, conspiracy to sell cocaine, child endangerment and weapon violations.

Mrs Cuevas was released on bail and stands accused of possessing cocaine with the intent to sell, conspiring to sell cocaine, and child endangerment.
