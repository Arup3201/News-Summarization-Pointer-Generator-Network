Deal: George Osborne is prepared to sell the Government¿s shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history

George Osborne is prepared to sell the Government’s shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history.

Senior Tory sources yesterday said that Labour had spent too much money on the 2008 bailouts, which injected £66billion of public funds into the failing banks.

They spoke after fresh reports the Chancellor is gearing up to sell an 82 per cent shareholding in RBS and a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds.

The Daily Mail first revealed in February that Mr Osborne wants to offload the shares before the 2015 election – and that he is examining the possibility of giving the shares away.

That would mean acknowledging taxpayers would not get all their money back, since the share prices of the two banks currently mean the deficit on paper is £24billion.

Several Treasury ministers believe a big privatisation would show the Coalition is drawing a line under the financial crisis and would boost confidence in the economy.

They hope that selling off – or giving away – the shares would kickstart trading in RBS and Lloyds shares and drive up the price, allowing them to get more money back.

But a minister close to the Chancellor told the Financial Times it was ‘unrealistic’ to expect the RBS share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future and the Government may have to sell while the shares were ‘under water’.

Insiders say Mr Osborne is prepared to make the argument that it would be better to get some money back and move on, rather than wait around with the bank shares on the public balance sheet with little prospect of ever getting taxpayers’ money back.

A senior Tory source told the Mail: ‘It is true Labour hugely overpaid for the original recapitalisation.’

It was reported earlier this week that Mr Osborne’s team hope former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in June.

That will make it easier to argue that the Government should sell its shares under the break-even mark.

But Mr Darling has criticised the attempt to point the finger of blame at Labour, saying that in April 2010 – just before the last election – RBS shares were trading above the price the Treasury paid.

‘I’ve not the slightest doubt all of this is a rather obvious attempt to blame the last Labour government for whatever they do,’ he said.

‘The share price we see today is largely of their own making.’

But there have also been rumours that the cross-party commission on banking standards, led by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, might recommend splitting RBS into a ‘good’ high street bank, with a ‘bad’ bank taking on its toxic loans.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, who is a member of the commission, has said he would like to see RBS broken up into a series of regional banks.

Sources at RBS said any sell-off was a decision for the Government but bank bosses were not adverse to moves that hasten a return to the private sector.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘This is all speculation. We will sell our stakes when it is in the taxpayers’ interest to do so.’
