Mystery continues to surround the origin of the 100-year-old fragments of rubber that have been washing up on the shores of Britain and northern Europe for the last two years.

Last week, conservationists cleared more than 100 rubber sheets, two rolls of rubber, three rubber ingots and several tablets from Chesil Beach in Dorset.

Some theorists believe the pieces could date back to the Titanic - and may have risen to the water's surface after being contained for more than a century in the lost wreckage of the ship - which sunk in April 1912.

Most of the pieces are engraved with the name Tjipetir, an early 20th century rubber plantation in west Java, Indonesia.

And their perfectly-preserved quality is alarming environmentalists and sparking fears over why supposedly biodegradable materials have remained completely intact. 

The rubber blocks and sheets are in such fine condition that they could have come from a ship that had just sunk.

But the material they are made from was popularly used around a century ago. 

Conservationist Steve Trewhella said it is worrying that the pieces, some about one metre long, are in such good condition considering the rubber is meant to be biodegradable.

The pieces are made from gutta percha, a form of latex made from the sap of a tropical tree of the same name.

It was used to make a wide range of items 100 years ago, including teddy bears' noses and golf balls, although the most common use was to insulate underwater telegraph cables.

Other sheets found washed ashore are marked 'Senawang' which was also an early 20th century rubber plantation in Asia.

Since perfectly-preserved pieces of 100-year-old rubber began to wash up on shores around northern Europe, several theories have been put forward to explain their mysterious appearance:

Similar pieces have washed up on beaches in Cornwall, Jersey, Normandy in France, Holland and Germany and there is a Facebook group, called Tjipetir Mystery, dedicated to the mysterious rubber.

One wild theory is that the pieces could have come from the Titanic.

Gutta percha tablets were listed on the famous ship's manifest before it sank on April 15, 1912, but there is no evidence these pieces would have come from the Titanic wreck.

Another possibility is that they came from a Second World War cargo ship on it's way from Asia to England. But as the cargo is valuable, the name of the ship will not be revealed until the salvage operation is complete.

Mr Trewhella said: 'It's a bit of a mystery. What we do know is that the rubber came from this plantation in Indonesia 100 years ago and it was destined for Europe and various parts of the world, but we have no idea what it would have been used for.

'This was before plastic existed and gutta percha was used for a variety of products from the soles of shoes to insulation for early telegraph cables.

Dubbed the 'unsinkable' ship, the Titanic famously struck an iceberg and sank in under three hours on April 15, 1912. Of the 2,224 on board, 1,517 passengers and crew perished.

It lay unseen on the ocean floor for decades, until 1985, when an American-French expedition identified its final resting place 329 miles south-east of Newfoundland.

The wreck, which was split into two sections 2,000ft apart, has now been the focus of research by scientists and historians for 25 years.

'There is a ship that went down off the Isle of Scilly a hundred years ago that we think it could be.

'Some people have speculated that it could be from the Titanic, which was carrying this product when it sank.

'In reality it seems quite unlikely but we do get objects washing up from as far as north America.

'It could be that a shipwreck is gradually disintegrating, and as the hold is becoming more exposed the cargo floats to the surface and washes ashore.

'Some of the pieces have goose barnacles on them which indicates this rubber has been floating on the surface for some time as they only attach to flotsam on the ocean surface.

'The thing we find most worrying is that this is biodegradable rubber and here it is, 100 years later, in near perfect condition. It is astonishing that this product has remained intact for so long.

'It still looks as good as the day it was made which raises concerns about the litter we are making now. 

'Scientists and various organisations make assumptions about how long things will take to break down but they don't really know.

'We're leaving a long-lasting legacy and I think people will be picking up our rubbish in a thousand years.'
