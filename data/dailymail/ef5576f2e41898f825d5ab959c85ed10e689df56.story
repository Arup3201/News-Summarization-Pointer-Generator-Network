Warning: Tomasz Siemoniak said Russian naval and air force activity has reached 'unprecedented' levels around the Baltic region in recent days

Russian naval and air force activity has reached 'unprecedented' levels around the Baltic region in recent days, Poland's defence minister says.

Tomasz Siemoniak said the majority of the incidents involved Russian operations in international waters, and that Sweden was the country most affected.

Mr Siemoniak said Poland sees Russia's show of military strength primarily as an attempt to test Nato, adding that 'it doesn't help to build good relations and trust.'

It comes after a number of claims by Nato states of Russian incursions including, just yesterday, fears that a Russian submarine had parked up just outside Scotland's Faslane naval base, home of Britain's nuclear arsenal.

Mr Siemoniak spoke in an interview with TVN24, which said that on Monday Dutch F-16s taking part in Nato's Baltic Air policing mission intercepted two Russian Su-34 bombers.

The Polish politician wouldn't give details of that incident, but said it was just 'one of many.' He said the issue would be discussed later in the day in Latvia with counterparts from the three Baltic states.

The incident is just the latest in a number of aerial encounters between Russian and Nato jets.

Last week the Norwegian military published dramatic footage of one of its pilots foced into an emergency manoeuvre to avoid a mid-air crash with a Russian fighter.

'The Russian pilot's behaviour was not quite normal,' said Norwegian armed forces spokesman Brynjar Stordal about the 26-second film clip of the encounter in international airspace 'north of Norway'.

'We don't know if it was a miscalculation or if he deliberately put himself in the path of our F-16,' said Stordal, adding that Norway's armed forces had informed Russia that the incident was 'undesirable'.

Norway's complaint came just a day after Britain said it was concerned by a sharp increase in Russian military flights close to its borders which it said were designed to test its air defences.

'The extremely aggressive probing of our air space by Russian aircraft is an issue of concern to us,' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told a committee of lawmakers.

'It is entirely appropriate for NATO countries in particular to work together to respond to what is a change of Russia's dealings with NATO and indeed the non-NATO European countries.'

Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers.

The bombers which flew near Britain were just two of 26 Russian planes intercepted over Europe in 24 hours

Nato announced last month that it had scrambled warplanes 400 times so far this year in response to increased Russian air activity around Europe.

Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the problem was not just where the Russians are flying but that they are not turning on their transponders or communicating.

He said the flights - which have risen 50 percent over the last year - posed a risk to commercial air traffic, but admitted there had been 'very limited numbers of violations' of Nato air space.

It came after it emerged Russia was resuming patrols by long-range strategic bombers in international airspace from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.

Estonia's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador yesterday after claiming a Russian plane had violated the country's air space.

The Russian defense ministry denied it, saying the Russian military aircraft was making a routine flight from Moscow to the Russian Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad 'in accordance with international rules for the use of airspace.'

On Sunday, Nato said Russian military activity 'has been considerable' in recent months. It added, 'Such activity can be destabilising and potentially dangerous, if international norms are not respected.'
