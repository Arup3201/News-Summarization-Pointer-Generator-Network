Caught: Retired school principal and 911 dispatcher Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach, went to a teen boy's Lantana home for sex after they met online, federal prosecutors say

A retired school principal from Indiana is facing federal sex and child porn charges after he was arrested in Boynton Beach, Florida for soliciting sex from an officer posing as a 15-year-old boy.

Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach was arrested after he drove from Indiana to South Florida to have sex with what he thought was a teenage boy.

The officer posing as the teen had been exchanging messages with Blake since October and arranged to meet him in January at the Boynton Beach Mall.

The person he was meeting was an undercover city police officer who posed as a minor on the online Grindr service. 

During their messaging, Blake sent the officer sexually explicit pictures of himself, police said.

Blake went to the boy's Lantana home within two hours of starting to chat online.

When investigators later conducted a detailed forensic search of his cell phone, they found evidence Blake had also gone to meet a real teen whom he thought was 16.

He is charged with soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct, traveling to meet a minor to commit an unlawful sex act and transmission of harmful material to a minor.

Blake moved to Delray Beach in August after retiring from his jobs in southern Indiana.

His online perversion began when he began using the online service Growlr, and they discussed meeting for sex.

Blake asked for, and received, sexually explicit photos of the boy.

The boy first told Blake that he was 18, then said he was 16 in online messages.

The former school head was well aware he was playing with fire.

In one online message 'Blake responded, 'I can't come to your house since you're underage. But you can come here,' 'Too much danger in getting caught. And I can't risk that,'' Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Schiller wrote in court records.

The boy sent Blake his home address and Blake sent the boy a photo of his penis.

Soon after the encounter, Blake began communicating with what he thought was another underage teen, only this time it was a police officer on the other end of his texts. 

Blake pleaded not guilty to four federal charges Wednesday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale. 

He is charged with two counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity and one count each of receiving and possession child pornography. 

Three of the charges involve the real teen; one enticement charge involves the undercover officer. 

The most serious charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years to life in federal prison.
