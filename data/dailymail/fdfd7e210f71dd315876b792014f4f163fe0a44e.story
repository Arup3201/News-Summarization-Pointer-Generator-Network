The ex-fire chief of Babbit, Minnesota, who has pleaded guilty to setting a series of fires in the Superior National Forest, has been diagnosed as a pyromaniac.

Ryan Scharber, 30, pleaded guilty on Friday to one count of setting fires on U.S. forest land and to attempted arson on property used in interstate or foreign commerce.

The father-of-three resigned as chief of the St. Louis County community’s volunteer fire department last December, after investigators traced the crimes to him and he eventually confessed.

Ryan Scharber, who is married to Stefanie and has three children, is facing five years in jail after pleading guilty to setting nine fires on U.S. forest land

According to documents filed in federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Dunne is requesting that Scharber should be given the maximum five-year sentence, reports the Star Tribune.

In the memorandum, Dunne disputed Scharber’s contention that he had set the fires ‘to get out of the house for a few hours to get relief from his newborn child’s acid reflux.’

The prosecutor noted that Scharber hadn’t offered that excuse during the five-hour interview with investigators in which he eventually confessed on December 19, 2012.

‘The psychiatrist at the Range Mental Health Center diagnosed the defendant with pyromania,’ Dunne wrote. ‘The real reason behind the defendant’s criminal conduct in this case was that diagnosis.’

In total, Scharber admitted to nine fires and one attempted arson at a resort over a 13 month period in 2010 and 2011 while he was the local fire chief

At one stage Scharber claimed his actions were the result of wanting 'to get out of the house for a few hours to get relief from his newborn child’s acid reflux'

Dunne said Scharber 'utterly violated the trust the public granted to him as the fire chief in Babbitt,' reports the NNCNow.com.

Federal prosecutors say he set fires in the Superior National Forest on Oct. 7-9 and Oct. 11, 2011, and on April 29 and Sept. 10, 2012, all in Babbitt.

Scharber also was charged with attempted arson at Mattila's Birch Lake Resort in Babbitt on Dec. 3, 2011.

Altogether, he admitted to setting nine fires, plus the attempted arson at the resort, over 13 months in 2010 and 2011.

In seeking a shorter sentence, his attorney, Joseph Tamburino, wrote on Feb. 14 that when Scharber pleaded guilty, he cooperated with authorities and showed 'extreme remorse.' 

His attorney wrote that Scharber had demonstrated willingness to seek and enter therapy for his behavior and has the support of his family and community members.

Tamburino also noted that Scharber had only set 'small fires in small unpopulated areas' and has no criminal history.

'He never intended that the fires destroy large amounts of property or endanger the lives or well-being of anyone in the community,' the attorney said.

Prosecutors say the fires put pedestrians and motorists at risk, and that firefighters, police officers and emergency responders faced danger when they responded to the calls.

Two searches were made of Scharber’s home and 34 people were interviewed as part of the invesitgation.

Scharber will be sentenced on April 10.
