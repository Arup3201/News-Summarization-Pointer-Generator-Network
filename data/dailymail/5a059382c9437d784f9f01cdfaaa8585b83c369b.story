Deep in to added time, Manuel Pellegrini was offered his Roberto Mancini moment. One chance for salvation, Sergio Aguero’s right foot. You know the story.

If this wasn’t quite an instant to match that of Manchester City’s title winning moment against QPR of May 2012, it was certainly one to stir the soul in similar fashion. In football – in sport – there is nothing quite like a contest that swings in the closing moments.

As he moves forwards, though, Pellegrini may realise that the similarities to Mancini’s day in the spring sunshine do not quite end with the score line and the name of the winning goal scorer.

For just as Mancini failed to capitalise on that amazing day two-and-half years ago, so Pellegrini must ensure that he does.

This was magnificent, stomach-churning stuff. City needed it. English teams in Europe needed it.

It will, however, mean absolutely nothing if Pellegrini and his hopelessly aimless team cannot capitalise, if they cannot use the adrenaline and the emotion of the experience to go on to better things.

Mancini’s City team got worse after winning the league. Pellegrini’s side must get better quickly if this season is to amount to anything at all over the next six months.

Aguero was scintillating. When isn’t he?

Both of the opportunities he was afforded by calamitous Bayern Munich errors were perhaps 50-50 in terms of the probability of a goal. The first one was the most important – without the first there is no second – and that was the most difficult.

The very best centre forwards, perhaps the top five per cent, have the ability almost to stop time when presented with opportunities that may frighten the life out of lesser sportsmen. Like leading golfers standing over six-foot putts, the idea of missing is simply alien to then.

Here, on both occasions, there was a tangible calmness about the way that the Argentine advanced towards goal and executed, Two chances, two goals. Only the very best can do that and Aguero belongs in that category.

That apart, though, there was very little to cheer here for Pellegrini and City.

On the whole, this was another lamentable night for a team stuck in quick sand both domestically and in Europe at the moment. The result will have given everybody at this club and in this stadium a huge lift but only those who watched with their hands over their eyes will be able to ignore the issues that continue to blight this team.

It is difficult to say that City played at all well at any stage of the game. They began poorly and were second best for a twenty minute period during which Bayern may have scored twice. Joe Hart blocked one effort and Eliaquim Mangala the other.

Frank Lampard was a claming presence in City's engine room as they bounced back to beat Bayern

Thanks to a super Frank Lampard pass, a rash challenge from Medhi Benatia and a typically well-executed Aguero penalty, City suddenly had the lead and a one-man advantage. On a night when only victory would do, this was their golden ticket.

City, however, are so lame these days – so lacking in direction and belief – that even that wasn’t enough to nudge them towards anything remotely approaching superiority. By half-time they were trailing and the most damning thing of all is that nobody here was the slightest bit surprised.

Over time, we expected City to impose themselves. Surely Bayern would tire and City would begin to stretch them and squeeze them at the same time. Remarkably, it just didn’t happen.

Bayern coach Pep Guardiola summed it up best afterwards when he said: 'We lost the game, we gave them the game.

'Look at the second half. We had ten but Manny [Manuel Neuer] never had to make a save.'

Guardiola was not being deliberately provocative, merely presenting a pretty accurate story of what had happened.

Bayern – without a clutch of key players – had kept City at bay with some comfort since edging ahead. There was no cavalry charge from City, merely lots of aimless football, devoid of rhythm and crispness, that was ultimately rendered irrelevant by two stunning Bayern errors that allowed Aguero in twice in quick succession.

Quite simply, City must improve. One of their better players was Frank Lampard. Amid all the talk of extending his loan from New York City FC, it is pertinent to ask yourself this: why would he stay and play in a team that currently looks incapable of making a significant impression in the Premier League or in Europe?

Does all this sound a bit sour on a night of such drama? Perhaps but City and Pellegrini should heed the warnings and of May 2012.

As Mancini found out to his cost, the gloss of these occasions will only last so long.
