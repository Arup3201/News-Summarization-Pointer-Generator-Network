Ed Miliband has boasted he is smarter than David Cameron, and does not need anyone else to tell him what to think.

In a bid to shake off his reputation for being ‘weird’, the Labour leader posed at home in casualwear for a newspaper interview to prove he ready to be Prime Minister.

But Mr Miliband’s claim to have ‘much more intellectual self-confidence’ risked backfiring because he actually got a worse degree than Mr Cameron.

Labour leader Ed Miliband boasted that he has the 'intellectual confidence' to take on David Cameron, despite gaining an inferior degree

A recent poll found 40 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is ‘weird’ and a third suspected he was bullied at school.

Labour strategists privately admit that many voters are put-off by their leader’s focus on abstract concepts such as ‘pre-distribution’, ‘predators’ and ‘responsible capitalism’.

Today he moved to win over swing voters in the South East with a pledge to crackdown on rich landlords buying up property in London but leaving it empty.

The announcement will be used to prove he is in touch with ordinary voters' concerns.

Meanwhile, portraying Mr Miliband as ‘weird’ and 
ill-suited to being Prime Minister is expected to be a key plank of the 
Tory election attack.

In an interview with the Evening Standard today, Mr Miliband brushed off the abuse, claiming he is clever than Mr Cameron.

He said: ‘What’s interesting is that of the two leaders in this who could be Prime Minister, between myself and David Cameron, I feel I am the one with much more intellectual self-confidence, actually.

‘I’m not the guy who says, “Oh I just want to be Prime Minister because it is a place to reach”. I actually have strong beliefs about how to change the country. This is an incredibly powerful weapon.

‘If you think about what sustains me — and it is not the easiest job in the world being leader of the opposition — what sustained me over three-and-a-half years is that sense of deep conviction.

‘I look at David Cameron across the dispatch box and I think to myself, I’m the one with the intellectual self-confidence because I actually know what I believe and I don’t need Lynton Crosby to tell me.’

He added that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid election TV debates because ‘he obviously doesn’t have the confidence’.

However, making an issue of intelligence could come back to haunt Mr Miliband, who famously only secured a 2:1 in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

Mr Cameron, by contrast, gained a first after studying PPE at Brasenose College, Oxford.

A poll in March by YouGov for BuzzFeed found some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron

Mr Miliband also rejected the idea that the Tories will portray him as ‘weird’ as the general election nears.

‘Have they decided that? I think the Tories are very unclear how they are to attack me. Half the time they say it is “back to the Seventies”.  Half the time they say, “He doesn’t seem to stand for anything”.’

Mr Miliband meanwhile today promised a new crackdown on 'ghost homes' being hoarded by wealthy investors across London.

The Labour leader claimed rich owners leave 60,000 properties standing empty driving in the capital up house prices for everyone else.

He told the Evening Standard: 'We’ve got to stop this phenomenon of empty properties being bought by overseas investors and nothing done about it.

'We live in one of the richest, most diverse and exciting cities that has ever existed on the planet, but the connection between the great wealth London creates and everyday family finances has been broken.'

Labour would double council tax for owners who let their flats lie empty and unused. And after the property has been empty for a year, councils would have powers to impose a 100 per cent increase in bills.
