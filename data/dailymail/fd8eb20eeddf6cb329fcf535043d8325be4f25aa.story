British taxpayers are funding waste collections in communist Cuba, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The EU has given £1.6 million to fund bin rounds on the Caribbean island as part of an environmental regeneration project – at a time when many UK collections are being cut.

Although the EU’s trade embargo against the communist regime ended in 2008, the Foreign Office still regards Cuba as a ‘country of concern’ because of its appalling human rights record.

Funded: The EU has given £1.6 million to fund bin rounds to regenerate the Caribbean island of Cuba

Last night, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the project revealed the ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ of Brussels bureaucrats.

The scheme, called Recycle For A Better Life, aims to increase ‘collection of municipal solid waste for households and non-residential in the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Dominican Republic’ as well as ‘making new generations aware about the environment’.

It is co-funded by the European Commission, part of the EU responsible for providing aid through programmes around the world.

The recycling project – agreed in April – is based around the historical centres of Havana and Santo Domingo, with cash funnelled through EuropeAid, part of the European Commission’. 

In Havana, ‘non-domestic users’ such as hotels, restaurants and offices, are required to separate their rubbish into paper, plastic, aluminium and tinplate, the project’s website states. 

The collections will also ‘be extended to home users’.

EU cash – including UK contributions – paid for 75 per cent of the three-year scheme, which is part of the €86 million (£68.7 million) in international development funding Brussels has given to Cuba since 2008.

'Breathtaking hypocrisy': The project comes as the UK faces dramatic cuts to waste collections

A European Commission spokesman confirmed the EU was contributing €2 million (£1.6 million) to projects in Cuba and Dominican Republic. 

‘Waste production is a continually increasing problem, especially in developing countries,’ she added.

‘Helping our partner countries get a proper waste management system is the main idea behind this project.’

But Mr Pickles said: ‘This is an example of breathtaking hypocrisy by the Eurocrats, wasting taxpayers’ cash on supporting extensive bin collections in communist Cuba while at the same time bullying councils into axeing weekly collections in Britain. 

'In contrast, this Government is working to improve the quality and frequency of recycling and rubbish collections, and supporting weekly collections.

‘The EU bin bureaucrats should be held to account for this appalling waste of taxpayers’ money.’
