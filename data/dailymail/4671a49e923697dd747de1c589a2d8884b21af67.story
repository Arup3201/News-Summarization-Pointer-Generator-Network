A TV celebrity chef yesterday told of his joy at being cleared of sex discrimination after a teenage pastry chef was ruled to have 'lied and wildly embellished' her claim for compensation.

Chloe Maisey, 19, of Pontyclun, South Wales, lost all 21 allegations against the all-male kitchen staff at the restaurant owned by Stephen Terry - the best man of Gordon Ramsey.

And an employment tribunal ruled she had no evidence of sexual discrimination - but had left because of long hours cooking at the top restaurant.

She was claiming compensation from Michelin-starred Mr Terry, 47, at The Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, South Wales, which has won awards for the best in Wales.

But the employment tribunal dismissed every allegation of sexual discrimination made against Mr Terry’s restaurant and three chefs.

The employment tribunal ruled the Hardwick did not to have a 'culture of sexist behaviour and language'.

Father-of-three Mr Terry - who trained with legendary Marco Pierre White and is a regular star of TV cookery shows such as Saturday Kitchen on the BBC  - was found to be a 'kind and involved family man who was kind toward his staff.'

Miss Maisey claimed she was ogled every day as she changed into her chef’s uniform at the restaurant which has no female changing rooms.

She also claims she was 'groped' when a male staff member slapped her bottom, that she was locked in a freezer and had a fish thrown at her.

Tribunal chairman Roger Harper said: 'We find that on numerous occasions Chloe Maisey lied or wildly embellished facts to embolden her claims.

The tribunal heard Miss Maisey left the award-winning restaurant after just 11 weeks because she was struggling with the long hours

'She left because she couldn’t handle the long hours. Many of her claims were dishonest.

'It is significant that she never complained to staff at the restaurant, her mother or father or her boyfriend. It was only at the end of her employment that she raised any grievance with her family.'

The tribunal heard Miss Maisey left the award-winning restaurant after just 11 weeks because she was struggling with the long hours and had failed to follow instructions on her last day in the kitchens.

After leaving the restaurant, she went on to make 21 sexual discrimination allegations against staff.

But the tribunal was read her resignation letter to Mr Terry which stated: 'I have had a very enjoyable time working for you.

'Thank you for this amazing experience you have given me. But unfortunately I will be leaving due to such long hours and issues at home.'

Mr Harper said she had happily showed off her tattoos and piercings to male kitchen staff at the restaurant.

He said: 'She was far from the polite and demure witness which we have seen. Like all of the kitchen staff she had sworn and made oral sex gestures at work.

'There were high jinks and pranks but Miss Maisey played an active part and enjoyed life in the kitchen. Mr Terry’s business has a very good reputation.

'We find no sex discrimination at his restaurant.'

The employment tribunal heard Miss Maisey turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants' and used 'sexually provocative' language at work.

Mr Terry said: 'We are very pleased and accept the findings. It is very unfortunate - we didn¿t plan on being here. We want to draw a line underneath it'

Sous chef Jamie O’Leary, 32, said: 'I didn’t find her clothes fit for the workplace. I thought some of the clothes she showed up in were inappropriate for work.'

Miss Maisey, who is several months pregnant, has a tattoo of a laced stocking top with antique pistol tucked into it around the top of her right thigh.

Mr Terry told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'.

Mr Terry said: 'We are very pleased and accept the findings. It is very unfortunate - we didn’t plan on being here. We want to draw a line underneath it.

'It is has been very disruptive to my work life and family life. I look to move on and forward.'
