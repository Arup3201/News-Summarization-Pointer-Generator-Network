A pod of energetic dolphins has showed surfers how to really ride the waves in Byron Bay

In the captivating video, the pod surfs weave in and out of the waves, dodging surfers and playfully chasing eachother. 

The beach, which is popular among surfers due to its massive waves, came to a standstill as the amazing animals flew past.

Surfers lay on their boards taking in the sight and sunbathers popped up their heads, eager not to miss the rare sighting.

The dolphins jumped higher than any surfboard would be capable of ever going and many surfers lost their boards halfway through catching a wave as they noticed they were not alone in the water. 

Mr O'Shea prides himself on capturing minuscule moments in time. According to his Facebook bio, he loves all wildlife and Byron Bay definitely does not disappoint. 

'He experiences special moments like witnessing and recording a pod of dolphins escorting a whale and baby from Cosy Corner to Wategos Beach, bringing him a great sense of wonderment and understanding of how precious our environment is,' his Facebook page says.

Surfers stopped what they were doing to marvel at the beautiful dolphins

The pictures come after a surfer was injured in Byron Bay at the start of February when he mistook a shark for a dolphin. 

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales’ north coast.

The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News.

Many surfers lay on their boards and forgot their sport as they watched the dolphins playing in the water 

A few surfers even lost their boards as they strained themselves to take a look at the dolphins

‘I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,’ he told Seven.

‘I didn't realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.’ 

The waters at Wategos Beach are known for their big waves 

The pictures come just weeks after a man was hospitalised after mistaking a shark for a dolphin in Byron Bay
