Prototype: Scientists have developed a 'smart bra' which can measure the wearer¿s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss

They are already used to lift, boost and enhance – but it seems bras  could soon be doing something else for women’s figures.

Scientists have developed a ‘smart bra’ which can measure the wearer’s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss.

Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse.

MC Schraefel, a professor in computer science and human performance design from the University of Southampton, has helped to design the bra which is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity.

The data from the prototype device is 
analysed by a smartphone app which can highlight when ‘emotional eating’
 is most likely to occur and offer advice to the wearer.

The app then provides suggestions, such as carrying out calming breathing exercises, to reduce the user’s stress levels.

Professor Schraefel said: ‘Emotional states, habitual practices, like snacking in front of the TV or grabbing  a cookie when stressed, often go undetected by us – that’s the nature of habits – but they have real effects on our wellbeing.

‘Our work in this project, while early, shows that there is potential to design interactive technologies to work with us, to help us develop both awareness of our state, and offer options we’ve decided we’d rather take, to build new practices and support our wellbeing.’

The bra is a result of a study called Food And Mood: Just-in-Time Support For Emotional Eating, written by researchers from the University of Southampton, Microsoft Research and the University of Rochester in New York, United States.

The study set out to develop an intervention which is triggered before someone reaches for food as a means of emotional support.

It suggested the smart bra and matching apps as possible solutions.
