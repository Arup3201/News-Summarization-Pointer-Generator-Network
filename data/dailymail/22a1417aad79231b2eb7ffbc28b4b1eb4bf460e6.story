Bearing up: James Sullivan, 26, first became ill on his wedding day when he began feeling sick and suffering an upset stomach. He felt significantly worse by the end of the longed for trip

A groom and his new wife are suing holiday giant First Choice after their family contracted salmonella while on their dream wedding holiday in Cuba.

Their baby daughter, the only one who was officially found to have the potentially fatal bacteria, was rushed to hospital after she began to fit.

At first James Sullivan, from Sheffield had put his jittery stomach down to pre-wedding nerves as he prepared for the big day at the Playa Pesquero hotel, in the Cuban resort of Holguin.

But 11 days into the holiday and on the morning of his wedding to partner Collette, he and his two young children's symptoms descended into diarrhoea, and abdominal pain.

When the couple returned from the nightmare trip, their baby daughter Ava's condition took a turn for the worse.

Mrs Sullivan said: 'James was ill on the wedding day but you grin and smile through it for a photo.

'He, my son Cole, four, and Ava were all ill.

'But Ava was the worst.

'It's not how you imagine your wedding to be.

'I was completely fine as I stuck to chips, and I didn't eat many of them as I had to get in my wedding dress.

'But on the plane home, Ava became very ill. She soiled her dress and we had to keep constantly changing her.

'She developed blisters around her nappy and bottom. It was horrible.'

Once the family were home in Sheffield the little girl became so desperately ill she began to fit and had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulance.

While there, it was confirmed 
little Ava had contracted salmonella, a disease which if the immune 
system is already low, can prove fatal.

Mr and Mrs Sullivan said they feared at one point their daughter would die.

Mrs Sullivan, a housewife, added: 'She overheated and started convulsing as if she was having febrile convulsions.

'She was boiling hot.

'I am epileptic, and it was just like an epileptic fit.

'Their main concern was cooling her down.

'Once they stabilised her and got her test results, they confirmed salmonella.

'It was just terrifying.'

The mother of two now fears her husband and son may have had the same bug that her young daughter was just too weak to fight off.

The Sullivan family said they 
expected the four-star Playa Pesquero to be a dream resort after seeing 
it listed as a ‘premier’ hotel on the First Choice website.

But they claim the hotel had poor food hygiene standards with 'birds and stray cats roaming the outdoor restaurant'.

They also became convinced staff were serving up leftovers after they were served 'peas and sprouts for breakfast'.

The Sullivan family have now instructed travel law experts at Irwin Mitchell to pursue a case against tour operator First Choice.

Sorry: First Choice said it was sorry the couple had not had a nice stay but insisted the hotel was a 'popular' destination

The firm successfully represented holidaymakers who were ill at the hotel in both 2008 and 2009.

She said: 'We know you get tummy bugs abroad.

'We're not scroungers and have thought hard about taking any action at all.

'If anything does come of this, all of the money will be put in a fund for Ava.

'We still don't know what the long term effects of the poisoning will have on her.

'She was so ill, she may never be the same again.'

She added: 'This was supposed to be the most perfect day of our life but the 
illness completely ruined our holiday and wedding celebrations.

'It was heartbreaking to see my daughter so ill and to find out she had contracted salmonella is terrifying.'

Mr Sullivan said: 'The food was sometimes undercooked, we saw some food uncovered so flies were buzzing around, and we suspected they were re-using food between meals - which became pretty obvious when they served up peas and sprouts for breakfast one morning.'

Jatinder Paul, a travel law solicitor at Irwin Mitchell representing the family, said: 'Instead of enjoying the first few days of married life, the Sullivans had to deal with the hugely stressful situation of caring for their very poorly family.'

A First Choice spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear the family did not enjoy their holiday.

'The Playa Pesquero Hotel remains a popular choice for our customers.'
