The victim of a cannibal killer had 'lost faith in the justice system' in the months leading up to her death after failed attempts to have her former boyfriend released from prison. 

Cerys Yemm was brutally murdered by Matthew Williams, 34, on November 6, hours after the pair met in  Caerphilly, south Wales,and just two weeks after the killer had been freed from jail.

In the months before her death, the 22-year-old had been campaigning for the release of her 'depressed' former boyfriend who was put behind bars for torching the couple's home.

Chillingly, Miss Yemm told of how she had 'lost faith in the justice system' after repeated failed attempts to have Matthew Hayman freed. 

Last October tried to set their house in Abertillery alight by gassing himself with the cooker. The 27-year-old was jailed for three-and-a-half years by a judge who said he had endangered the lives of neighbours. 

Miss Yemm contested the sentence, claiming her former partner, who struggled with 'mental illness', had been trying to take his own life and not hurt others. 

In a comment posted beneath a court report of her boyfriend's sentencing in January, she wrote: 'It was because he has suffered with mental illness for many years from a young age, and was let down severely by the system, as he has never had help after numerous suicide attempts. 

'All he done was try and end his life, if he had slit his wrists or overdosed he wouldn't be in prison now. (sic)

'I have lost all faith in (the) justice system as there is none!' 

Hayman's mother, Debra, has paid tribute to her son's former girlfriend. 

'Cerys was lovely. I'm so upset.

'She and Mathew were lovely together,' the 49-year-old told the Sunday People.  

Miss Yemm was savagely murdered on Thursday after meeting Williams who, it has been claimed, had taken a dangerous concoction of mind-altering drugs before the attack.

Miss Yemm had only met her murderer hours beforehand during a night out in Caerphilly. The 22-year-old returned to the hostel where he was staying where staff discovered the grisly scene 

Williams was a resident of Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Caerphilly, a bail hostel manned by security guards 

The pair met hours before Williams convinced Miss Yemm, a shop owner, to return to his room at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel. 

There, hotel staff burst in on the criminal eating one of her eyeballs, having chewed off part of her face. 

He died in police custody after being Tasered.

Williams had been  described as 'an infamous character' in his hometown of Blackwood with a reputation for violence. 

He had only just been released from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for attacking former girlfriend Emma Thomas, 38, at her home before killing Miss Yemm.  

A review into whether or not Williams was properly monitored following his release from jail is to be carried out, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed.  

Such reviews are immediately launched if a serious offence is alleged to have happened within 30 days of a person leaving prison or is on licence.

It will examine the circumstances of Miss Yemm’s death, the management of Williams following his release and whether steps can be taken to improve public protection.

Politicians called for his case to be looked into upon the news of Miss Yemm's death.  

Hundreds of people have paid tribute to the 22-year-old  memorial pages have been set up on social media

Welsh Assembly member William Graham said: 'It is now clear that Mr Williams posed a risk to the public and I am extremely concerned that monitoring appears to have been deemed unnecessary.

'If true, a wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required.

'Questions must be answered by authorities and a full explanation provided on the decisions taken in this extremely tragic case.' 

It comes after tribute pages on social media websites set up in Miss Yemm's memory were hacked by 'sick' trolls who posted links to pornographic videos among comments. 

One 'community' page titled Cerys Marie Yemm directs mourners to a video with the comment: 'Video Tribute in Memory of Cerys Yemm. Rest in peace pretty girl.'

But when friends have clicked on the link, they have been redirected to pornographic footage and, in some cases, asked to pay £24 to view it. 

Mourners have reported the footage to Facebook, with one writing: 'Who ever posted this video is as sick as the man who committed the hideous crime against this beautiful young girl, I’ve reported this video.

'I hope your found and prosecuted.'

Another, Shelley Davis posted: 'I’ve tried the video and I’m getting porn whoever did this is a nasty sick saddo.' 

A video of Miss Yemm carrying out the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge for charity emerged today as hundreds of people shared tributes to the 22-year-old. 

Dressed in a maroon dress, the shop worker sits on garden chair looking into the camera to nominate friends to take part before being soaked by icy water.
