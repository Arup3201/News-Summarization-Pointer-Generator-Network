City executive Rona Fairhead will appear before a Commons select committee next week before a final decision is reached over the BBC Trust role

The Government’s preferred candidate to take over as the BBC’s first female chairman is to face a grilling from MPs.

City executive Rona Fairhead will appear before a Commons select committee next week before a final decision is reached over the BBC Trust role.

The former head of the Financial Times group has been approved by the Prime Minister to succeed Lord Patten. If confirmed in the post, she will be paid £110,000 a year for a three-day working week.

But Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, said she faced questions over her role as a non-executive director on the board of banking giant HSBC.

The banking group was fined £1.2billion in 2012 for breaching US money-laundering laws and was described as the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug gangs.

Mr Davies said: ‘I want to know what she knew about that scandal and what she did to try to prevent it and what she did to investigate it.

‘Second, there is a question mark over her lack of experience in broadcasting and the regulation of broadcasting, which are obviously key elements of being the BBC Trust chairman.’

Another member of the committee, Conor Burns, has suggested ministers were ‘determined’ to appoint a woman to the role.

Mr Davies added: ‘We need to ask if she only got the job because she is a woman. I am not saying that Rona Fairhead is the wrong candidate, but our job as a committee is to ask searching questions of any candidate who is put forward for this job.’

The 53-year-old mother of three could also face questions over her political links, having been appointed as a British business ambassador by David Cameron earlier this year.

She was a non-executive member of the Cabinet Office board but stood down when she was selected as the preferred candidate to chair the BBC Trust.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was on the preliminary interview panel for candidates for the BBC Trust role.

Her husband Tom, a director of the private equity firm Campbell Lutyens, is a former Tory councillor in the West London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The Government has stressed that she was selected following ‘an open recruitment process’ overseen by an independent public appointments assessor.

After questioning Mrs Fairhead on Tuesday of next week, members of the Commons select committee will vote on whether they believe she is a suitable candidate and their decision will be put before Mr Cameron for final approval.

She was chairman and chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and received a £1.1million pay-off when she left last year. As well as her HSBC role, she is a non-executive director of soft drinks giant PepsiCo. The BBC will consider whether any of her external roles could represent a conflict of interest.

Mrs Fairhead holds a first-class degree in law from Cambridge University and has an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was recently tipped as a future chairman of Barclays. According to the Sunday Times, Mrs Fairhead expressed a willingness to consider changes to the BBC licence fee when she was interviewed by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid. 

She said: ‘The BBC is a great British institution packed with talented people, and I’m honoured to have the opportunity to be chairman of the BBC Trust.’ Lord Patten announced in May that he would be standing down as chairman of the BBC Trust following heart surgery. 

The previous frontrunner to succeed him, Lord Coe, pulled out of the race because he said he could not balance the job with his other commitments.

Mother they called Airhead who fought all the way to the top

By GUY ADAMS  

Rona Fairhead was made chairman and chief executive of The Financial Times in 2006 

When you shatter glass ceilings, it helps to have thick skin. That’s something Rona Fairhead has had to learn the hard way on her journey to the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the BBC in its 91-year history.

At the Financial Times, where she was made chairman and chief executive in 2006, boorish male journalists nicknamed her ‘Rona Airhead’, in the belief that she owed the job to gender-based tokenism rather than talent.

Now, male MPs are making similar noises, with Conor Burns, a Tory who sits on the Commons committee that will vote on her appointment, expressing ‘enormous’ regret ‘that the Government seems determined to appoint a woman simply because it’s a woman, rather than go out and find the best person’.

Others, including Conservative Philip Davies, have voiced concerns about her involvement in recent pay-off and money-laundering controversies and lack of experience in broadcasting.

There are also dark rumours of political cronyism.

Mrs Fairhead, who was educated at Yarm Grammar School and still speaks with a hint of her native Teesside, is married to wealthy merchant banker Tom Fairhead, who is a former councillor and senior figure in Kensington and Chelsea Tory circles. The couple, who have two teenage sons, and a teenage daughter, live in a £4million home in Holland Park, West London.

They are friendly with George Osborne and his wife, Frances. Mrs Fairhead’s links to the Cameroonian establishment extend to her agreeing to become one of the PM’s ‘business ambassadors’.

She also sat on the board of the Cabinet Office alongside Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s top civil servant, who is regarded as the most powerful backstage fixer in Downing Street.

Strangely, given the need for the BBC appointment process to be seen as unimpeachable, Sir Jeremy happens to have been the most senior member of the selection board which interviewed her for the new job. Quite what the members of the Commons culture, media and sport committee will make of this incestuousness when they interview her next week is anyone’s guess.

Yet if history is any guide, Mrs Fairhead, will take criticism on the chin. She has, after all spent the last 30 years on a sharp-elbowed climb through the boardrooms of corporate Britain.

A tenacious professional, who cut her teeth as a management consultant, she has spent the past two years battling breast cancer, while holding down directorships of PepsiCo and HSBC, along with the Cabinet Office role.

Former Whitehall mandarin Ian Watmore yesterday described her as ‘a class act… tough, ethical and likeable’.

She is on the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the BBC in its 91-year history 

Mrs Fairhead joined the Financial Times, as chief financial officer in 2002, and began to achieve public prominence as a protégé of Marjorie Scardino, who had in 1997 become the first female FTSE 100 chief executive as boss of the title’s parent firm, Pearson.

Mrs Fairhead’s time at the FT’s helm, from 2006 onwards, saw the newspaper become hugely-profitable. But she decided to leave the company in 2012, after failing to be appointed to succeed Dame Marjorie. Although the move was voluntary, the firm gave her a pay-off of £1.1 million, and allowed her to keep millions more in share options.

That prompted a shareholder rebellion which saw 37 per cent refuse to endorse Pearson’s remuneration report.

The controversy has eerie parallels with that which engulfed the BBC Trust last year, over revelations that senior managers had been given £1.4 million in unnecessarily big pay-offs.

Mrs Fairhead, who describes her hobbies in Debrett’s as ‘skiing, scuba diving, flying and family’, has never publicly discussed the affair.

If confirmed in her new post, she must not only restore public confidence in the credibility of a BBC Trust severely compromised by the Jimmy Savile affair, but also oversee negotiations for the renewal of the Corporation’s charter, which is due to expire in 2016.

It’s an unenviable job, but – as woman with a meteoric career and as a member of Bournemouth Flying Club – Rona Fairhead will relish the challenge.
