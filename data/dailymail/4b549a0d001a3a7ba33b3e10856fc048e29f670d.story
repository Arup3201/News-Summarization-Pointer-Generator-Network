It is a measure of how far Moeen Ali has come in a very short space of time that he should be chosen for the front cover of this year’s Wisden.

This time last year he was just one of the many promising emerging players about to be given a chance in an England team forced to start again in the wake of their Ashes humiliation.

Now he is a significant figure in cricket and culturally, having first proved to be a role model for British Muslims and then showed what an exciting cricketer he is with both bat and ball.

England all-rounder Moeen Ali has been revealed as the 2015 Wisden Almanack front cover star

Ali has shot to prominence for the Three Lions since making his international debut last February

Moeen knows what it means to be highlighted by the cricket bible. It would be no surprise if Lawrence Booth, Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer, selects him as one of his five cricketers of the year when the almanack is released in April.

‘It’s gone very quickly,’ said Moeen. ‘It’s been a really good year and hopefully there will be a few more for me with the England team.

‘Somebody sent me the Wisden picture and it’s really nice. It’s an honour to be on the front of it. I have a couple of copies from the past and my dad’s definitely going to get the new one.’

It would be even better received if Wisden is published on the back of a productive World Cup. Moeen is proving himself just as important to the one-day team as the Test one now, being preferred to Alex Hales as the man given licence to get England off to a flying 50-over start.

He scored a hundred as opener against Sri Lanka before Christmas and he put on England’s first century opening stand for two years with Ian Bell against Australia.

‘I don’t think I played that well in Hobart,’ he said. ‘I struggled a bit early on but because Belly was going so well I didn’t have to do anything stupid — even though I did in the end!

‘I didn’t have rhythm and I tried to force it a bit. Belly said, “It’ll come, it’ll come,” but I gave it away and hopefully I can learn from it.’

Ali's spin bowling will be key if England are to do well at the World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand

Moeen’s off-spin proved far more effective in Test cricket last summer than envisaged, taking 19 wickets against India, and he is proving a quick learner in the one-day game.

Now it seems that he will be first-choice spinner and James Tredwell will be consigned to the sidelines.

‘I’ve started off quite well with the ball, trying not to go for too many runs,’ said Moeen. ‘If I bowl flight to these guys they’ll murder it so I try not to give too much air. But when conditions are right with a bit more spin I’ll look to attack a bit more.’

England must beat India at the WACA on Friday to qualify for the Tri-series final against Australia.
