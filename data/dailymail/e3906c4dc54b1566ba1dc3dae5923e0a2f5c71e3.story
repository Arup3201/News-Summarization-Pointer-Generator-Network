Danny Alexander warns of an ‘explosion of aggressive advertising’ during sporting events televised before the 9pm watershed

Aggressive television adverts for casinos and betting websites must be reined in because it is ‘almost impossible’ to prevent children seeing them, a senior minister warns.

Cabinet correspondence leaked to the Daily Mail reveals a growing Coalition row over whether to reverse Labour’s controversial decision to lift restrictions on gaming commercials.

As research suggests children as young as four are exposed to gambling adverts more than 200 times a year, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander warns of an ‘explosion of aggressive advertising’ during sporting events televised before the 9pm watershed.

In a letter to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Alexander complains that a review of gambling advertising being conducted for ministers ‘has still not reported’.

‘This is a matter of principle, and I believe the time to act is now,’ the Liberal Democrat minister insists.

The Mail highlighted warnings from doctors and Church leaders when the last Labour government allowed unlimited numbers of gambling adverts for TV in 2007. 

It allowed them to be screened during any programming after the 9pm watershed, and at any time of day during major sporting events.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists warned there was clear evidence that advertising would lead to more problem gambling.

As a result of Labour’s reforms, there has been a 1,500 per cent increase in gambling commercials, which now make up 4 per cent of all advertising.

Campaigners say schedules have been flooded with aggressive commercials for bingo, online gambling sites and sports betting which give the impression that children and vulnerable people are being encouraged to see gambling as a fun, everyday activity. 

However, the Culture, Media and Sport department is resistant to change, according to government sources.

Criticised: Viewers are tempted by celebrity names such as Bet365’s Ray Winstone to bet on everything from the time of the first goal to the number of corners in a football match

In his letter to Mr Javid, Mr Alexander writes: ‘I am growing increasingly concerned by the prevalence of betting advertising during televised sporting events that are watched by children.

‘It has now become almost impossible to watch any kind of sports event without being bombarded by highly solicitous advertising. The decision by the previous government to allow betting companies to advertise during sports events before the watershed is completely anomalous. It was, of course, part of a grubby deal cooked up by the last Labour government.’

The Chief Secretary said people who wanted to gamble ‘have every right to do so’, but added: ‘Many parents enjoy sitting down with their children to watch a big sports event. I suspect very few now consider what is advertised during the breaks acceptable.’

A review of gambling advertising was due to report last year, but has still not been published.

Experts are due to make recommendations on any changes needed to the industry’s voluntary code, including on the suitability of the 9pm watershed arrangements. 

They are also assessing the latest evidence on the link between advertising and gambling addiction, to determine if a broader crackdown is necessary.

Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt is calling for a change in the law to stop the ‘insidious’ rise in gaming commercials. ‘They make gambling seem normal,’ she said. 

‘Adverts portray gambling as a glamorous pursuit and a quick and easy way to make money. However, the reality is often very different – with addiction and debt having a devastating impact on individuals and families.’

The latest adverts trade on the concept of people betting ‘in play’. 

Viewers are tempted by celebrity names such as Bet365’s Ray Winstone to bet on everything from the time of the first goal to the number of corners in a football match. 

William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Coral recently agreed to impose a voluntary ban on TV adverts offering free bets before 9pm.
