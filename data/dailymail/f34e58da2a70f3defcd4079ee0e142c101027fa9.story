This is the moment a jet pilot came within yards of a disastrous mid-air crash with a helicopter over the Peak District on Tuesday.

The dramatic picture, which was captured over Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District National Park, appears to show the undercarriage of the fighter jet close to touching the rotating blades of the helicopter.

Aviation experts believe that the two aircraft may have passed within 2,000 - 3,000 ft of each other - putting them just 650 yards apart.

Close call? A Tornado jet comes within yards of what is believed to be a Bell 206 helicopter above the Peak District

No reports: Despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near-miss, the UK Airprox Board, which investigates such incidents, has not received any reports relating to this sighting

The fighter jet is believed to be a Tornado while the helicopter is said to be a Bell 206 which was possibly spraying the moors at the time.

But despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near-miss, the UK Airprox Board, which investigates such incidents, has not received any reports relating to this sighting.

And, according to the CAA, the picture suggests that the two aircraft are too far apart to be classified as a close call.

Richard Taylor, from the CAA, said: 'My initial impression is that this is not an airprox - near miss - incident and that the two aircraft are in fact several miles apart.

'In reality, the helicopter is less than half the size of the jet, but it appears bigger in the photo.

'This would lead me to think that the jet is actually 2,000ft to 3,000ft in the distance from the helicopter.'

An airprox, or near-miss, is classed as a situation where a pilot or air traffic controller feels the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed has compromised the safety of the aircraft, according to the UK Airprox Board.

There are around 200 reported airprox incidents each year.

Around 10 per cent of those reports are said to involve gliders.

A passenger jet pilot reported in December that his aircraft came within just 300ft of colliding with an unidentified flying object.

The shocked pilot reported the collision risk as ‘high’.
