A GP has made a passionate attack on the sickness benefits culture by using Professor Stephen Hawking as an example of someone not held back by disability.

Dr Phil Peverely was so incensed by the thousands of patients ‘hell-bent’ on trying to prove they are ill just to claim benefits that he considered displaying a poster of the physicist with the caption: ‘This bloke is not on the sick.’

He described how entire surgeries are filled with the ‘disgruntled unworking well’ who are ‘full of indignation at being considered reasonably healthy’.

The doctor, who practises in 
Sunderland, said it was absurd how he was being asked to spend so much 
time trying to prove patients were ill when he was meant to be making 
them better.

‘We are, as a profession, dedicated 
to making our patients as healthy as possible, and yet a proportion of 
punters are hell-bent on trying to prove they’re really ill, and need us
 to confirm it,’ he said in a column for the doctors’ magazine Pulse.

‘The fact is, nearly everyone is 
capable of some kind of work. I had considered, at one point, putting up
 a portrait of Professor Stephen Hawking in my consulting room with a 
caption that said, “This bloke is not on the sick.” ’

Professor Hawking has motor neurone 
disease, which has left him almost entirely paralysed and only able to 
communicate through a speech-generating device.

Criticism: GPs should not be responsible for signing people off as too ill to work, argues Dr Phil Peverley (file picture)

Despite his 
disabilities, he is one of the most eminent scientists in the world and 
has won numerous awards for his research.

Dr Peverely said GPs were ‘wasting far too much time’ assessing whether patients were well enough to work.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has argued many people on sickness benefits are capable of work

‘The dilemma of constantly dealing 
with requests to confirm illnesses that I have already sorted out is 
wasting far too much time and muddying the doctor-patient relationship,’
 he wrote.

Government figures published earlier 
this year showed that only one in eight people on sickness benefits was 
really too ill to work.

Yet polls have shown that three 
quarters of GPs feel obliged to issue the sick notes to patients even if
 there is no medical need.

Dr Peverely, who has been a GP for 26
 years, said being deemed ‘fit to work’ didn’t mean that patients had to
 be available for a strenuous job.

‘Being found fit for some kind of 
employment by Atos [the firm that oversees the assessments] does not 
mean you’re necessarily capable of being an FBI agent or a lumberjack,’ 
he wrote.

‘However, you might be able to work at a desk on a telephone, or hold a lollipop on a zebra crossing.

‘And we all know, without any shadow 
of a doubt, that any form of regular employment is not only financially 
beneficial but also leads to less depression, greater social contact, 
increased well-being, a decreasing tendency to addiction and social 
deprivation, and an increased likelihood of being in a stable 
relationship.’

In May a poll of 4,000 family doctors
 by the Department for Work and Pensions found that three quarters felt 
obliged to issue sick notes, which allow patients to claim benefits, 
even though they were not strictly ill.

Many doctors admitted they did not 
know enough about the system and were compelled to sign patients off if 
they had emotional problems.
