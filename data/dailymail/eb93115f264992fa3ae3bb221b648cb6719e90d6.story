Women today may feel they have come a long way since the inequality of the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. But the shelves of many toy shops paint a very different story.

Where once toys may have been marketed in neutral colours to target both boys and girls, now they are much more likely to be gender stereotyped - blue for boys and pink for girls.

The issue has been highlighted by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys, who recently shared a picture comparing the toys on sale in Argos in the Seventies to today on their Twitter feed.

Avalanche of pink: A comparison by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys shows how in the Seventies, left, toys were in a variety of colours while today girls are pushed to embrace one shade

While decades ago toy pushchairs, prams and household equipment like play ovens came in whites, reds and blues - aimed at both genders - today the majority are all pink.

And while the items above aimed at girls relate to being domesticated, in contrast boys today are encouraged to play with science sets, cars and action heroes.

Let Toys Be Toys, set up by a group of British parents last November, are calling for this to change. They are petitioning retailers to stop segregating their products 'for boys' and 'for girls'.

One of the campaign's founders, Tricia 
Lowther, 44, a self-employed copywriter from Durham, who has a five-year-old daughter, told the 
MailOnline: 'It does bother a lot of parents, we seem to have tapped in 
to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are 
promoted according to outdated, illogical and sexist stereotypes.

'I 
can’t speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was
 the realisation, after my daughter was born, that gender stereotyping 
in children’s products had become worse than when I was a child myself 
back in the Seventies. It’s something that has become almost impossible 
to escape and is very limiting for children.'

Shelves of a typical toy shop show the girl/boy divide: For the girls, it is all pink with Disney princess and Barbie promoted while the toys for boys to the right are blue and Star Wars themed

The Let Toys Be Toys petition, which has already 
gained 6,000 signatures, states: 'In 2013 it is time to take down the 
signs, labels and categories that tell parents, grandparents and 
children that construction sets, adventure games, cars, science toys and
 superheroes are 'toys for boys', and that baby dolls, play kitchens, 
make-up sets, fashion, princesses and crafts are 'toys for girls'.

'Toys are for fun, for learning, for stoking imagination and encouraging creativity. Children should feel free to play with the toys that most interest them.'

Research by Elizabeth Sweet, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of California, has backed up Tricia's belief that gender stereotyping of toys is getting worse.

Writing in the New York Times last year, she said: 'We've made great strides toward gender equity over the past 50 years, but the world of toys looks a lot more like 1952 than 2012.

'During my research into the role of gender in Sears catalogue toy advertisements over the 20th century, I found that in 1975, very few toys were explicitly marketed according to gender, and nearly 70 percent showed no markings of gender whatsoever.

'In the 1970s, toy ads often defied gender stereotypes by showing girls building and playing airplane captain, and boys cooking in the kitchen.

Boys are encouraged to play with mechanical toys and science kits while for girls it's all about dolls

'But by 1995, the gendered advertising of toys had crept back to mid-century levels, and it’s even more extreme today. In fact, finding a toy that is not marketed either explicitly or subtly (through use of colour, for example) by gender has become incredibly difficult.'

Let Toys Be Toys believe this kind of gender stereotyping from an early age can be damaging for children.

They state: 'Whilst toys aimed at boys encourage activity and adventure, many girls’ toys send the message that appearance is what matters. It’s no surprise that the vast majority of adults with eating disorders are women.'

Psychologist Steve Biddulph agrees. In his book, Raising Girls, he points to how little girls are are continually being bombarded with the message that it's their looks and being 'hot' that is the most important thing. While the media is to blame, he also points to the toy industry playing their part.

He gives the example of a new range of 'Friends' Lego aimed at girls (predominantly pink of course) that focuses on being beautiful and marginalises female roles in society.

He said: 'Recently, the company (Lego) started producing five curvy plastic 'friends' who bake, home-make, decorate, style hair and shop. Plus a plastic female ghetto called Heartlake City, which somehow manages to thrive without any fire-fighters or policemen.'

As well as toys aimed at girls being given a pink makeover since the Seventies, many children's favourite characters have also been glamorised - driving home the message that appearance, above all, counts.

Disney faced a backlash from parents (and had to back down) after they recently tried to make Merida from Brave more sexy by giving her larger eyes, a smaller waist and frizz-free hair.

But a look back at other characters - including Rainbow Bright and Strawberry Shortcake - shows how this has been going on for years.

While once these female characters looked wholesome and innocent, now they're slimmer with longer legs and more make-up.

Backlash: Disney had to back down after giving Brave character Merida a sexy makeover, right

Even animals don't escape a sexy make-over. The popular My Little Pony - which back in the Eighties did resemble the figure of a horse - has now been given long, slim legs, huge eyes complete with long false eyelashes and a long, wavy mane to rival the Duchess of Cambridge's.

It isn't just girls who suffer from the gender segregation of toys. It also leaves boys unable to play with what they want due to what Ms Sweet calls 'a homophobic culture' of boys been mocked if they 'transgress into the 'pink' zone' and play with toys like dolls.

Let Toys Be Toys believe by making and marketing toys in a more gender neutral way, children will truly have the freedom to develop.

They state: 'This isn’t about political correctness. This is about doing the right thing by our children and giving them a real and varied choice. We believe in equality, but this isn’t about making children the same. It’s about giving children the choice to be individuals.'

Rainbow Bright: In her modern day incarnation, right, the character is taller and slimmer with more make-up and slicker hair. While the Eighties version looks like a little girl, today she is more like a woman

Strawberry Shortcake: The modern day version, right, has a slimmer figure, longer hair, bigger eyes and a smaller nose

My Little Pony: Not so much a pony anymore, right, with longer, slimmer legs, bigger eyes and a a flowing mane

Lego: In the Seventies, the stables were red, white and blue, today, right, they are predominantly pink
