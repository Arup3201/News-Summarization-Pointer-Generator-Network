Creative entrepreneur Asher Charman has created 15 tubs and has recently upgraded his projector

Mr Charman is hoping to expand his hot tub operation into Europe and North America

Mr Charman said: ‘Starting Hot Tub Cinema didn’t feel like a decision - once I had invented and experienced it myself, I couldn’t help but want to share it with as many people as possible.'

‘I first discovered how great hot tubs are about seven years ago.

'I already owned a projector for showing films - another passion of mine, and it didn’t take long to realise I could enjoy both of these at once. 

'We shared it with friends and they loved it too - so we felt compelled to keep going.’

Movie fans are transfixed to the screen as they enjoy food and drink in their tubs

A conga line of 100 people in their swimming outfits has taken place on some nights

Mr Charman has upgraded his projector, perfected the logistics and worked tirelessly to find the perfect venues to share the unique experience.

He added: ‘The best thing about Hot Tub Cinema is that each night has its own unique vibe - with every new audience we see new ways of enjoying the experience.

'We’ve had quieter nights, more excitable nights, even a conga of 100 people in their swimmers, against the backdrop of London’s inimitable skyline.’

Ticket prices range from £25 to £200 and Mr Charman is planning to expand his hot tub operation into Europe and North America.
