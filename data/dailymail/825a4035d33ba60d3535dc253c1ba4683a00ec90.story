A fire that ripped through the $18.5 million Malibu mansion of actor Pierce Brosnan on Wednesday has caused $1million in damage.

The former James Bond star and his family were home when the blaze erupted in the property's garage, calling authorities and exiting the residence when they were alerted by a smoke alarm.

Some sources are now saying an appliance in the garage caused the flames.

KTLA reports that as many as 20 firefighters responded to the first-alarm residential fire and put the flames out within 30 minutes.

As a result, only the garage and a nearby guest bedroom sustained any damage.

Brosnan, who was home with wife Keely Shaye Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze.

Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was.

One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house.

He then added; 'It’s an unusual house. Going through the permitting process and building it just took a long time.'

It seems that this may not be true however, as Brosnan razed the existing property when he purchased it to build this eco-friendly beachfront abode.

'Pierce and Keely have always been dedicated environmentalists and they were determined that their dream home would set a new standard in being eco-friendly,' a source previously told The Mail on Sunday.

‘All the windows are non-glare, insulated glass and there is a centrally controlled climate and lighting system that will automatically turn off the lights if a room is left vacant for more than five minutes.

'The climate control will automatically adjust various rooms to maximise energy savings. It’s an eco palace.

‘Pierce has been actively involved in every single aspect, right down to choosing the natural recycled wood for the kitchen benches and the low-flow toilets.’ 

When asked for comment, Brosnan said he just wanted everyone to know that he and his family were safe.

The average property on the street, with neighbors including Steven Spielberg, Goldie Hawn, Mel Gibson, Cher, Dustin Hoffman and Danny DeVito, is valued at $10million.
