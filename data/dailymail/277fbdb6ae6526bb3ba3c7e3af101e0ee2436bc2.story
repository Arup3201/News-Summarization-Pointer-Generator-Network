Injured captain Michael Clarke spent time in a private box at the Sydney Cricket Ground with the family of Phillip Hughes on Tuesday, as Australia began an emotional final Test dedicated to the memory of the tragic cricketer.

Clarke shared tender moments chatting with Hughes' mother Virginia and friends, who were joined by the late 25-year-old's father Greg, as they watched Dave Warner pay the ultimate tribute with a heart-breaking century on the pitch where Philip Hughes was knocked down.

'This was his ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground,' Clarke said in a Nine Network tribute. 

Australia finished the opening day 2/348 with Shane Watson 61* and Steve Smith 82* after a dominant day of play. 

The start of play was marked by scenes of the Australian players, wearing black armbands as they have done throughout the series, touching a recently erected plaque of Hughes as they walked down the SCG race. 

Warner, who has played with obvious inspiration in this Test series against India, looked to the sky and leapt into the air when he notched his third hundred of the summer.

Earlier, the left-hander - a close friend of Hughes - knelt on the pitch as he reached 63 not out and kissed the spot where Hughes played his final inning.

'This is where he played his last game, this is where his spirit will live forever.

'I never had a blood brother but he was my brother.

'Together we enjoyed life and celebrated one another's successes, when he made runs when I made runs.

'It felt like we make our hundreds together.

'His love of life, it helped me get out of bed in the morning, I didn't want him to beat me at anything, yet loved it when he did.'

David Warner celebrated his century ecstatically, leaping into the air and pointing his bat to the sky. Unfortunately, he was caught just moments later and dismissed for 101.

Chris Rogers came close but was robbed of the opportunity to celebrate his own century when he was bowled for 95. 

Hughes made his first class debut at the SCG for NSW in 2007 and played his first Test on home soil at the venue in 2010. He played his final Test at the ground in 2013.

Clarke spoke of Hughes' resilience.

'A good guy who fought for everything he ever got and then fought some more, who never game up,' Clarke said.

'In death he brought the sporting world together, the cricket community, the game might be bigger than any individual but it stopped for Phil Hughes, it stopped in its tracks, didn't it?

'Even today I'm still waiting for him to call.

'The cheeky little bugger, he would be up there, smiling on us now wanting us to be happy enjoying life, getting on with it.

'I will never play a Test match again without the number 408 on my shirt , Hughdog's Test number

'The one that stopped the cricket world and changed it for the better and forever.'

Stand-in Australian captain Steve Smith said it would be a tough Test for his team.

Smith's Australian teammates David Warner, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin and Nathan Lyon were on the SCG playing in the Sheffield Shield game between NSW and South Australia when Hughes was struck down.

'It's nice to have the series wrapped up ... it's going to be a tough week,' Smith said at the toss.

A plaque of Hughes, which is attached to the Member's Pavilion, was unveiled at the SCG on Monday.

'It's nice to have his spirit here with us,' Smith said.
