A 28-year-old woman has posted online a video of her confronting the female teacher who allegedly molested her as a 12-year-old girl.

The shocking clip, which was uploaded to YouTube last Friday, shows a woman who identifies herself by the name Jamie X, talking about abuse that she allegedly suffered at the hands of a teacher at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside, California. 

Jamie X calls Alhambra Unified School District where she claims that her attacker is now an assistant principal. In the call, she tells the woman, whose name is not being released by MailOnline, that she did something terribly wrong.

The woman, who identifies herself on the tape as the alleged attacker, replies: 'Yes, and I regret it.'

Jamie X then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement.

Jamie X asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?'

To which the alleged molester answers: 'It's not.'

Jamie X goes on to tell her alleged attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'.

When she hangs up the phone, she shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number.

She says: 'And I’m shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.'

The video, which has been viewed more than 70,000 times, is accompanied by the words: 'I am 28 years old and have been waiting 
years to get up enough courage to report a teacher for sexually abusing 
me for years.

'When I finally got up enough courage to report her, I 
found out that the statute of limitations was up and she will never have
 to pay for the things that she did to me.'

The Alhambra school district confirmed to CBS that the women who identified herself on the tape is no longer employed by them.
