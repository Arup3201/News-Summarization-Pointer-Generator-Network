Conservationists have launched a fresh attack on the killing of sharks cull off Western Australia after a tiger shark was shot three times and took 15 minutes to die.

According to environmental group Sea Shepherd, the three-metre long creature was caught about 1km off Mullaloo Beach, north of Perth, on Monday.

A hook pierced its head and the creature sustained further injuries as it thrashed around and tried to free itself.

Brutal: Department of Fisheries Western Australia authorities haul up a 3m tiger shark that had been killed as part of a cull - sparking debate from conservation groups

When found by Western Australian Fisheries, the department reportedly used its boat, bearing the slogan slogan fish for the future, to drag the distressed animal.

Following this, three fatal shots were then fired into the shark's head before it was hauled onto the boat and then later dumped out to sea.

Sea Shepherd Australia managing director Jeff Hanson said it took the shark up to 15 minutes to die.

'The reason they killed it its part of the fisheries' policy that any shark more than thee metres will be killed,' he said of the cull's conditions.

'We won't accept the Japanese whaling fleets doing that. They're (the fisheries) killing a protecting species.'

Mr Hanson alleged the Western Australia Fisheries authorities have used tactics such as running the Sea Shepherd's boats out of fuel and dumping sharks in exclusion zones to prevent them seeing the full extent of the cull.

The drum line program was introduced in January after seven fatal shark attacks in Western Australia waters in the last three years

Sea Shepherd crew member Tim Watters he struggled to comprehend the treatment of the shark.

'I have now seen first hand the barbaric, senseless, cruel and tragedy of the Western Australia shark cull,' he said.

'I have seen today a beautiful female 3m plus tiger shark in such a stressed state, thrashing around for her life, before being pulled alongside and shot three times.

Mr Watters said it was likely the shark was pregnant at its time of death, given the time of year.

'I have just returned from defending the whales in the Antarctic Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and can not believe what I am seeing right off our Western Australia coast, it rivals that of any cruelty and insanity of the Japanese whale poachers.

A Department of Premier and Cabinet spokesperson said as of March 16, 110 tiger sharks had been killed.

'It's not an unusual occurrence,' he said of killing the shark and added that the rifles used were the most humane way of doing so.

The spokesman confirmed sharks under three metres are released alive as soon as possible, while those more than three metres of the bull, tiger or white species are killed humanely after being caught.

'Sharks under three metres are released if they are alive and OK. But we do pull up some dead sharks,' he said.

With sharks being killed daily as part of the cull, the spokesman said the aim was to make beaches safer.

Earlier on Monday, the non-profit conservation organisation saw an injured 2.7m tiger shark caught on a drum line 1km off Scarborough Beach, north of Perth, be released by Western Australia Fisheries, despite its injuries.

With the animal believed to have been hooked during the night, the fisheries officers inspected the caught animal.

Despite the animal's wounds, after pulling the shark on board, it was released into the water near its original capture still bleeding.

Sea Shepherd Captain Mike Dicks said with the possibility of the shark being hooked over night, it would have been unable to swim and get vital oxygen to its organs. This causes the animal to go into a tonic state of immobility.

Mr Dicks said the contrary to the cull protecting the public from sharks, it was doing the opposite. 'It makes public safety worse with sharks being drawn closer to our beaches stimulated by bait,' he said.

Mr Hanson said despite the shark's release, it could have died or been attacked by other animals. 'We don't know - it's hard to say,' he said. 'It really wasn't in a good state.'

Both of the the incidents were caught on video by the Sea Shepherd organisation, watching from a nearby boat.

Mr Hanson said the cull was not about sharks being more important that humans, but wanted to see alternatives used to killing the animals.

'Healthy oceans give humanity oxygen and oceans need sharks,' he said. Mr Hanson added in a time of animal conservation including sharks, the Westrern Australia government was using 1950s solutions for the issue.

He cited the protection of the great white shark, which is also being killed as part of the government's cull.

Alternatives include eco-barriers and relying on a shark spotters program, where surfers and swimmers collect data on sharks to asses the level of shark danger.

The Australian Federal Government approved the cull, which ends in three years, but the Western Australia Government is seeking to extending these until 2019.

Sea Shepherd Australia aims to stop the destruction of habitat and killing of ocean wildlife and recently failed to secure a Supreme Court injunction to force the WA government to suspend the cull.

The trial of the cull runs until April 30.
