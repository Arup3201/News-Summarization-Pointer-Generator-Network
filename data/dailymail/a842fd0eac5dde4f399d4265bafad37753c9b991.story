When the Ebola began to savage thousands West Africans, it was Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head, Dr. Thomas Frieden, who promised Americans that a similar 'widespread outbreak' would not occur in the U.S.

After the first Ebola patient was diagnosed in the U.S., it was Frieden who took to national television to assert that nation's top doctors 'know how to stop Ebola spreading in hospitals.' 

And when the man who brought Ebola to the U.S. died last Wednesday, Friden was the Obama administration official tasked with announcing that the U.S. government was 'stepping up protection for people coming into this country and for Americans related to travel.'

Frieden, not the 'Nation's Doctor,' has been at the forefront of the Ebola crisis throughout the last several months, leading some Americans to wonder why the surgeon general hasn't led the administration's efforts to stop the spread of the deadly disease in America.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Tom Frieden has been giving press briefings on the Ebola virus from the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, rather than the surgeon general, who is commonly referred to as the 'Nation's Doctor'

Frieden has become of the face of the Obama administration's efforts to stop the spread of Ebola because it's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, pictured here in February, has not been confirmed by the Senate because of his controversial views on gun violence

Currently the U.S. does not have a permanent surgeon general. President Barack Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy to fill the spot last November after the previous surgeon general vacated the position. 

Murthy's nomination has been tied up in the Senate since March amid concerns from conservative, gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, that the Harvard and Yale educated doctor would seek to implement restrictions on the Second Amendment if he were confirmed for the position.

British-born Murthy is a supporter of President Obama's efforts to reduce gun violence by restricting the sale of certain firearms.

In October of 2012 he sent the following tweet out from his twitter account: 'Tired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue.'

The NRA and it's powerful lobbying arm pounced on the statement after Murthy, who also co-chaired a group called Doctors for Obama, was nominated and warned Senators that they would punish them  if they voted to confirm the 36-year-old doctor as the spokesman for the government's public health initiatives.

At a nomination hearing before a Senate subcommittee in February, Murthy testified that his views on gun control would not affect his ability to serve as surgeon general

'My concerns with regard to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician, he further explained and 'seeing patients in emergency rooms.'

But that didn't quell the NRA's concerns that he may allow his political beliefs to seep into his medical work.

In mid-March a spokesman for the organization told the New York Times that 'given Dr. Murthy’s blatant activism on behalf of gun control, that’s not a gamble we’re willing to take.'

As a result, Murthy's nomination has still not come for a vote before the Democratically-controlled Senate - more than six months later - as vulnerable Democrats in conservative-leaning states have tried to distance themselves from anti-gun efforts ahead of November's federal elections.

Murthy's fight to become surgeon general had mostly been forgotten amid a number of other high-level scandals and resignations that have hit the White House in recent months until Ebola showed up on America's shores.

Now, liberals in the media are arguing that Murthy, not Friden, should be out calming Americans and cautioning them on how they can avoid contracting the disease.

'Murthy has no business sitting around and waiting to be confirmed. The Obama administration should have been raising holy hell, demanding that a pre-eminent doctor get his vote on the Senate floor,' News One Now host Roland Martin wrote in an op-ed for The Daily Beast titled Where the Hell Is the Surgeon General?

Martin argued that the Obama administration should use Murthy 'as the poster child for a nasty, devilish lobbying group being the de facto fourth branch of government.'

Likewise, MSNBC's Krystal Ball wrote in a joint op-ed with MSNBC producer Anne Thompson that 'thanks to NRA power and Senate cowardice, we are left with no surgeon general during a time when, we not only have Ebola arriving on our shores, but are also dealing with the mysterious Enterovirus, which is infecting and contributing to the deaths of children in the U.S.' 

Ball and Thompson said that Frieden has 'his own vital work to attend to as both head of the CDC and the U.S. Ambassador to the World Health Organization' and shouldn't have to divide his time doing the surgeon general's job, as well.

While the U.S. does have an Acting Surgeon General, Rear Admiral Boris D. Lushniak, MD, he has opted to stay behind the scenes throughout the Ebola scare and defer to Friden, instead.

Former Health and Human Services Director Michael Levitt, a George W. Bush cabinet member, told the Washington Post last week that in his opinion, it's not critical that the U.S. does not have a permanent surgeon general at this time nor is it crucial that the agency's acting director is allowing Frieden to take the lead on Ebola outbreak prevention.

'The surgeon general has a big brand, but in terms of their capacity to execute health response, that really isn’t their responsibility, and this is a job that CDC is well equipped for and they have physicians more authoritative on this particular subject,' he said.

The nation's most recent surgeon general, Regina Benjamin, disagreed. 

Asked for her thoughts on the situation, the former Obama administration official told WaPo 'there’s a major role in any crisis, in any potential crisis, any potential event that people are concerned about' for the surgeon general.

'We need that level of trust and conversation that there is someone there in Washington as America’s doctor,' she said.
