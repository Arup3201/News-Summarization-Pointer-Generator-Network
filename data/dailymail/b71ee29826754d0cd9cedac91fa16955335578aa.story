Some of Britain's most notorious criminals including serial killer Rose West and Soham murderer Ian Huntley have the keys to their own cells – meaning they can roam virtually at will.

A third of all prisoners in the UK, including those convicted of murder, rape and terrorist offences, have been handed privacy locks under a scheme to protect their 'decency'.

Conservative MP Philip Davies, branded the country's prison system a 'joke' after he found that 28,767 out of 84,865 offenders have keys in a series of Freedom of Information requests.

'I think that many people will find these figures staggering, and not know whether to laugh or cry,' the Shipley MP told the Sunday Express.

'However it perfectly illustrates and sums up what a joke the prison system is in the UK and why so many people have no confidence in it at all.'

Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, home to child sex offender Ian Watkins and Huntley, who murdered 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, is one of 70 prisons which operates the scheme.

Lostprophets singer Watkins was recently moved to the high-security prison after being sentenced to 35 years for a string of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.

The Ministry of Justice confirmed that every prisoner on the site has their own cell key, other than those who have been segregated or are undergoing treatment on the hospital wing.

Suffolk strangler Steve Wright, who murdered five prostitutes, and Tanvir Hussain, who plotted to blow up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs are also inmates at the prison.

All the inmates at female Low Newton prison, in Durham, where West is detained, have the privacy keys. 

She was convicted in 1995 for a killing spree with husband Fred, that saw 10 young women murdered.

The couple subjected their victims to horrific sexual violence before they were killed, dismembering and burying the bodies beneath their house in Gloucester.

Gartree prison, in Leicestershire, which is home to Europe's largest population of lifers, also has their own privacy keys.

They were designed to enable prisoners to protect their belongings when leaving their cells and use the  toilet and washing facilities in private.

Inmates are only allowed to use the keys at set times and the guards hold security keys which can override all other locks. 

According to the MoJ privacy locks have been in use since 1991 and are now fitted as standard.

A spokeswoman said: 'Governors have the authority to operate schemes in which prisoners may hold a 'privacy key' to their allocated cells as part of their local regime.

'This gives a prisoner the ability to open and close their own cell during a designated set period when the door would otherwise have been open.

'It does not allow them to open other cells or doors/gates to other parts of the prison.

'At all other times the cell doors can only be opened by prison staff who hold security keys which operate a separate cell door lock.

'These locks override the privacy locks at all other times, and ensure that staff have complete control over all cell doors.

'The retention in possession of a privacy lock key by a prisoner does not impact on the overall security of the prison and presents a minimal risk.

'All privacy lock schemes are implemented and managed at a local level and keys are only issued to prisoners whose suitability has been assessed.' 

'The responsibility of locking their own cells can also help to prepare prisoners for release.

'The availability of privacy keys to appropriately selected prisoners does not represent a risk to the public and is entirely different from security keys which are used for the perimeter of the prison and controlling internal access and movement.'
