'A sexualized attack': Dem Alison Grimes campaign condemned the sexist photo-shopped picture

The National Republican Senatorial Committee scrambled to apologize Tuesday amid outrage from an ‘extremely offensive’ photo-shopped image tweeted by a junior staffer.

A tweet sent from NRSC’s official Twitter account asked if Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes is the new ‘Obama Girl’ and featured Ms Grimes’ face poorly pasted on to the body of the original ‘Obama Girl.’

A spokesperson for the campaign committee blamed the ill-advised tweet on a junior staffer and said ‘disciplinary action has been taken.'

The amateurish photo-shop job shows Ms Grimes' face superimposed on the body of ‘Obama Girl,’ the model who made racy videos about her crush on then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2007. The woman is wearing a snug-fitting Obama T-shirt with her midriff showing.

‘We agree, it's extremely offensive, said the spokesperson. ‘It was a mistake made by a junior staffer and disciplinary action has been taken.’

‘We took corrective action as soon as it was brought to our attention and have taken steps to ensure it will never happen again.’

Ms Grimes is the Democratic front-runner for her party's nomination to take on U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.

She condemned the tweet as ‘sexist’ and issued a challenge of sorts to Mr McConnell.

The NRSC has since deleted the tweet.

‘The NRSC should stand for Notoriously Repeating Sexist Comments – they cannot relate or connect with the women of Kentucky or our country,’ reads a statement from Ms Grimes. 

‘As Kentucky's more than two million women know, it is not what is in the dress that matters,’ she added. ‘It is what is in the head, and I will stack my head up against Sen. McConnell's any day.’

Ms Grimes’ campaign sent out another news release later in the day that called the tweet a ‘sexualized attack.’

McConnell also faces a GOP primary challenger, Louisville businessman Matt Bevin.

The McConnell campaign voiced no sympathy for Ms Grimes in a statement Tuesday afternoon. 

McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore instead accused Grimes of trying to use the incident to distract from ‘the real news’ that she attended a fundraiser with first lady Michelle Obama in New York on Monday.

"It is really pathetic that the Grimes campaign is more worried about what some intern in the basement of the NRSC is tweeting rather than talking about the real issues facing Kentucky,’ Ms Moore said before further bashing Ms Grimes.

‘Mitch McConnell is dedicated to running on the issues and challenges Alison Grimes to do the same.'

Mr McConnell, a five-term incumbent, has made Barack Obama a focal point of his re-election campaign, trying to paint Grimes as a rubber stamp for a president who is widely unpopular in Kentucky.

The NRSC has drawn the ire of Grimes supporters before, Politico noted.

Only two months ago, a senior staffer called Ms Grimes an ‘empty dress’ who ‘babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment.’

A recent poll showed both candidates in a virtual tie, the election will be held next year.
