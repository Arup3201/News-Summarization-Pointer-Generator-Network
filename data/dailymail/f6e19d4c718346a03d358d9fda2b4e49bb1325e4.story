Roma, meanwhile, fall three points behind leaders Juventus, who beat Empoli on Saturday, while Napoli moved into third.

This was the first time the two sides had met since the clashes that led to a fan's death from a shooting before the Italian Cup final in May. 

Roma fans were barred from traveling to Naples for the game but there were still concerns of reprisal attacks and there were tight security measures put in place.

Roma came into the match on a high after moving level with Juventus at the top of the table, while Napoli coach Rafa Benitez was still under pressure after mixed results.

But it was Napoli who had the better start and they could have been three ahead inside the opening 12 minutes.

Higuain acrobatically volleyed home with a scissor kick following Lorenzo Insigine deflected effort, then Insigne and Callejon both went desperately close soon after.

Roma worked their way back into the game, but it was Napoli who created the better of the chances, with Hamsik hitting the crossbar after Higuain had been denied.

Roma came out fighting after the break and Alessandro Florenzi fired wide before forcing Napoli goalkeeper Rafael into a smart save.

However, it was again Napoli which had the best opportunity shortly after the hour mark when Kalidou Koulibaly led a rapid counter attack and set up Callejon, who dinked the ball over De Sanctis only for Radja Nainggolan to sprint back and clear off the line.

But they did finally managed to kill the game off with six minutes to spare, as a delightful diagonal pass from Higuain allowed Callejon to slot home.
