Heavy snow and a severe cold snap have killed at least 48 people across central and eastern Europe.

Poland, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic have all been hit by temperatures as low as -26C - causing schools to close, roads to be blocked and power cuts.

Residents have been urged to stay indoors as local authorities open up hundreds of emergency shelters in a bid to halt the rapidly escalating death toll.

Ukraine's Emergency Situations Ministry said 30 people died of hypothermia and nearly 500 people sought medical help for frostbites and hypothermia in the last week.

At least twelve of the dead were homeless people whose bodies were discovered on the streets. Temperatures in parts of Ukraine plunged to minus -16C during the day and -23C during the night.

Authorities opened 1,500 shelters to provide food and heat and shut down schools and nurseries.

At least 10 people froze to death in Poland as the cold reached -26C today.

Malgorzata Wozniak, a spokeswoman for Poland's Interior Ministry, said elderly people and the homeless were among the dead.

Police are now checking unheated empty buildings to corral the homeless into shelters. Until now, Poland had been having a mild winter with little snow and temperatures just below freezing.

In the Czech capital of Prague, city authorities worked to set up tents for an estimated 3,000 homeless people. Freezing temperatures also damaged train tracks, slowing railway traffic.

The cold snap is expected to continue throughout the week, with an established area of high pressure in Scandinavia and western Russia preventing mild air from southern Spain and northern Africa moving northwards.

Croatian meteorologist Zoran Vakula said: 'We are getting some "real" winter this week.'

Temperatures in Moscow, Russia, are not expected to get higher than -19C. The normal temperature at this time of year is -8C in the Russian capital.
