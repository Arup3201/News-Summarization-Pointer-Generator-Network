Google founder Sergey Brin's alleged mistress has written a detailed account of her battle with depression.

Amanda Rosenberg, a 27-year-old Google marketing manager, was named in August as the alleged 'other woman' who split Brin and his now-ex-wife Anne Wojcijki.

Now Rosenberg has published a journal-style post on her Tumblr account where she details her ongoing treatment for depression.

'It became increasingly difficult for 
me to make decisions. I had no empathy for anyone, and I started to 
crave solitude,' the British-born Google employee wrote.

'The
 worst part was that it became harder to face people, even those I 
loved. It felt much better to be holed up on my sofa for unhealthy 
periods of time, which was odd as only a few years ago I was a 
high-functioning humanoid.

'Darkness
 surged through my veins and permeated my eyeballs. All the feelings I’d
 hoarded over the years were now rushing through me in one go and all I 
wanted was a one-way ticket back to numbsville.'

Ms
 Rosenberg writes that she has been undergoing treatment for the illness
 for the past six weeks but says that it has been a problem that she 
didn't recognize she had for more than two decades.

'Now,
 as I’m going through treatment, I’m seeing and feeling the repressions 
of Christmas pasts, scooping out all the trauma which lead me to this 
point,' she wrote.

'The 
positive in all of this is that I’m not doing it alone.... Reaching out 
for help is the single best and bravest decision I have ever made.'

She
 published the post on her Tumblr, Individual Contributor, on January 7 
and shared the link via Twitter to her more than 2,300 followers that 
same day.

Ms Rosenberg's 
relationship with Brin, the 40-year-old billionaire, became public in 
August when it was announced that he and Ms Wojcicki were living 
separately.

It is not known
 how long Miss Rosenberg, who was educated at the $48,000-a-year 
Marlborough College, the same school as the Middletons, has been dating 
Brin.

An unnamed source told the New York Post Brin and his wife were 'still together when Amanda entered the picture'.

It is possible the relationship violated Google's company code.

An
 online version of the code states: 'Romantic relationships between 
co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of 
the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of 
interest'.

massive fortune would have to be halved - although they reportedly 
signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement

Marriage on the rocks: A Google spokesman confirmed that Brin – one of the 
world’s richest men – has for several months 
been living apart from Wojcicki, the mother 
of his two children

Brin is not the 
first Google executive Miss Rosenberg has been linked to since she 
transferred to the San Francisco offices last year.

She was linked to Hugo Barra, who resigned this week to take a job with Android phone maker Xiaomi in China.

His
 departure comes after 'a recent thorny personal situation related to 
the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,' the New
 York Post reported.

'Relationships
 between senior executives and more-junior employees raise myriad 
concerns,' James McRitchie, publisher of Corporate Governance, said.

An
 employee of Google since she graduated with a communications degree 
from Leeds University, she initially worked for the internet giant in 
London before last year moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon 
Valley nerve centre.

She 
soon won a role promoting Google Glass, widely criticised as the glasses
 which enable users to film and broadcast over the internet everything 
they see non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners.

with the voice command ‘Ok, Glass’ to 
activate them

Connected but no longer together: Brin and his estranged wife are bound together by business dealings - he is an investor in her DNA company 23andMe - and the children they share.

Miss
 Rosenberg wrote an online blog soon after she arrived – describing 
herself as a ‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with 
Californian optimism’.

She 
wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed life in London for 
pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, life. Then one day I 
realised the beauty had faded.

‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer!

‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that!

‘I remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and no one talks about how it felt to be alone.'
