As Mexican drug cartels pump cut-rate methamphetamine into the U.S. at increasingly alarming rates, the DEA has reported record seizures of the drug at the California-Mexico border.

14,732 pounds of the drug were seized by the San Diego field office in the last fiscal year, ending September 30, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports. 

That's a whopping 63 per cent of all reported seizures by both land, sea, and air ports across the nation.

'The Mexican cartels are flooding the U.S. marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine,' Gary Hill, the special agent in charge of the DEA's San Diego operations, told U-T San Diego. 

'We have seen the trend of the price of meth decreasingly tremendously since 2008,' he added. 

Once produced mostly stateside, regulations on many of the precursor chemicals used to make the addictive synthetic drug have pushed manufacturing to Mexico, where labs now account for an estimated 90 per cent of production.

A pound of meth can be purchased by undercover agents for $3,500 as opposed to the $11,800 it would cost for an equal amount of cocaine. 

'The overhead is tremendous for cocaine,' Hill said. But for meth, 'the overhead is minimal. They oversee the manufacturing. There is no middleman.'

The Sinaloa cartel and the Knights Templar are the groups doing the most business, producing the drug and overseeing smuggling routes into California.

'That’s our supposition,' Hill told U-T San Diego said. 'They control the gateway at San Diego and they seem to be the ones who are most involved in manufacturing the methamphetamine, so it kind of goes hand-in-hand.'

Once into the West Coast, the drug is spread using distribution hubs to the north. Agents find meth shipped from Los Angeles making its way to Atlanta, Chicago, New York, North Carolina, Seattle, San Francisco, Montana, and even Canadian cities. 

'What we noticed first was an increase in smuggling among teens,' said Joe Garcia, the interim special agent in charge for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. 'Initially it was marijuana, then there was a shift to hard narcotics, where meth was the main hard narcotic being smuggled.'

The smuggling is done in fairly small quantities, hidden in sealed food cans, spare tires, engine compartments, and even strapped to the bodies of pedestrians. 

Not all of the smuggles are Mexican. In one June case a 21-year-old U.S. citizen was discovered hiding three pounds of the drug under her clothing. A 62-year-old U.S. citizen was arrested in April concealing meth inside of cheese. 

Bob Hood, the CBP's assistant director for the San Ysidro Port of Entry says the trend has been pedestrians with drugs on their person.

As meth can be liquified and hidden into gas tanks, windshield wiper fluid, and juice bottles before being reconstituted in labs, DEA agents are having to search deeper into vehicles into difficult places to search. 

There has been a 300 per cent increase in seizures of the drug at California entry ports since 2009.

In turn, prosecution has jumped, with more than 60 cases of meth seizure at ports of entry involving one kilo or more in 2014 prosecuted by the San Diego District Attorney's office compared to only eight cases in 2013. 

Meanwhile over 2014 marijuana, cocaine and heroin seizures dropped. 

'We're seeing as much if not more meth than marijuana,' Hood said.

And that increase has led to serious repercussions across California, says Meth Strike Force coordinator Angela Goldberg.  

'We are seeing a lot of health consequences, such as big increases in meth deaths and emergency room visits, along with public safety consequences, such as more arrests and more people in jail who test positive for meth,' she said. 'It’s very hard to get past these drug cartels. They’re very good at what they do.'

There were 267 meth-related deaths in 2013 according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office: 190 overdoses, 22 motor vehicle accidents, 21 homicides with victims who tested positive for the drug, and 23 suicides.
