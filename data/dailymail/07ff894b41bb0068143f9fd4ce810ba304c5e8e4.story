Cashing in: Sally Bercow will receive £60,000 for her appearance in Big Brother, with around £20,000 going to her new publicist, Max Clifford

She has justified her decision to take part in Celebrity Big Brother by promising to donate a large sum to charity.

But good causes will not be the only beneficiaries of Sally Bercow’s controversial appearance on the show, which begins tonight.

It has emerged that Mrs Bercow, the outspoken wife of House Of Commons Speaker John Bercow, will be paid £60,000 for participating in the reality television programme.

The mother-of-three will keep £40,000 and pass the remaining £20,000 to Max Clifford to act as her publicist during the show’s run.

Aides have described the cash she will pocket as a ‘very small contributor’s fee’ and said she will still make a £100,000 charitable donation.

But the lucrative deal is likely to anger MPs who have accused Mrs Bercow of ‘using Parliament for  her own financial gain’ and going to inappropriate lengths to raise her public profile. 

The 41-year-old, who last year failed in her attempt to become a Labour councillor in Westminster, has hired Mr Clifford to represent her while she is on the show, which has moved from Channel 4 to Channel 5.

His other clients include former girl band singer Kerry Katona and Imogen Thomas, the ex-lover of footballer Ryan Giggs.

Last night Mr Clifford said: ‘I can confirm [Mrs Bercow] is giving  a £100,000 fee to her chosen charity. She’s also being paid a fee a lot less than that and is paying me out of that.’

While his firm has been appointed to act as media representatives only during Mrs Bercow’s time on the show, there is a chance the arrangement could be extended.

Unhappy: Mrs Bercow and the Speaker disagreed over her appearance on the show, and he will remain in India on holiday while the show is on air

The Speaker’s wife is said to be keen to explore other television projects, particularly with music mogul Simon Cowell, who is another of Mr Clifford’s clients.

A source said: ‘She is keen to  meet Cowell. And he’s interested in meeting her. So when she’s out  of the Big Brother house, that’s going to happen.

‘Sally has some interesting ideas for TV programmes. There are also some other TV projects, including TV  presenting, which she’s quite keen  to pursue.’ 

A source also revealed that Mrs Bercow and her husband, who will remain on holiday in India while the show is on air, disagreed over her participation in the programme.

Other contestants: Mrs Bercow will compete against Jedward in the show, who are receiving £500,000 each to appear

The source said: ‘John didn’t want her to go on the show – but she didn’t want him to be a Tory politician. So it’s give and take. 

‘One of the reasons she chose to go on the show was because you can’t get much more anti-establishment than appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. And that is one of the things that appealed to her – upsetting the establishment.’ 

Another source added: ‘He [Mr Bercow] asked her not to do it. He thinks the show is completely dreadful.

‘They disagree on a lot of things. She doesn’t like the fact he is a Tory and he doesn’t like her being a socialist. But they love and respect each other as individuals.’ 

Attack: Tory MP Rob Wilson said it was not appropriate for Mrs Berow to appear on the show for financial gain

Inside the Celebrity Big Brother house, Mrs Bercow will compete with contestants including X Factor twins Jedward, who are each receiving £500,000 to take part, and reality TV personality Amy Childs, who appeared on ITV2’s The Only Way Is Essex. 

Celebrity Big Brother initially began as a charitable spin-off of the main programme. During its first series, in March 2001, each celebrity participated for nothing with all the money raised – a total of £500,000 – going to Comic Relief.

However, by the last series, screened on Channel 4 in January 2010, celebrity participants were commanding hefty fees. 

Footballer turned film star Vinnie Jones was the highest paid performer in that series, receiving £350,000. He is thought to have donated some of the money to military charity Help for Heroes.

Mrs Bercow’s £100,000 charity donation will go to Ambition  For Autism, of which she is a patron. Her eldest child, Oliver, is autistic. 

When it emerged that Mrs Bercow was going into the house, Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘John Bercow said he wanted to restore respect and dignity to Parliament in his manifesto for Speaker. 

‘I am not sure how Sally Bercow going on one of the country’s tackiest shows helps.

‘Is it really appropriate for the Speaker’s wife to use Parliament for her own financial gain?’
