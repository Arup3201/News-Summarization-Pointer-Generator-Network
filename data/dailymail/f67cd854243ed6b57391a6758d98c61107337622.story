Forget online dating, an unusual new relationship expert says she can help by play Cupid  - by using her psychic powers.

Tamara Trusseau, who is in her early 40s and single, told MailOnline she has been aware that she had clairvoyant abilities since childhood and she now uses them to give advice on love.

She said: 'From an early age I was aware that I could sense situations and emotions in a way that would not be considered obvious or apparent. I was a teenager before I could truly explore and experiment with what would be generally referred to as psychic ability.

Intuitive: Tamara Trusseau said she's had a 'heightened sense of instinctive awareness' from an early age

'I look upon intuition as a fundamental part of life. To a large degree, psychic ability may be regarded as a heightened sense of instinctive awareness and intuitive perception.'

Tamara, who lives in London, says she can use her 'intuitive perception' to help people in situations where they may not see clearly - for instance if a physical attraction is clouding judgement on whether a man is a suitable life partner or if anger or misunderstanding is causing friction in a relationship.

She explains: 'Some situations are difficult to handle when you are in there. I can give some clarity and peace of mind. 

'Someone might come to me and say: "Tamara, I came to you and I had no idea what was going on in this situation, I didn't understand this person's actions or feelings but I am walking away now understanding why things have been as they have been, knowing why he behaves how he does".'

Clarity: Tamara said her readings and advice can help people whose relationships may be in trouble

Find love: The psychic advises singles using various techniques including aura therapy and runes

In her own life, Tamara said being psychic has 'many useful elements from little warnings aiding to avoid certain minor incidents, to much greater input, enabling more effective major decisions'. 

She also says they have helped in her own life, enabling her to avoid sticky romantic situations and understand that not every encounter will lead to marriage. 

Nevertheless, Tamara who has appeared on Sky Channel Psychic Today where she was dubbed 'The Love Goddess' for her advice and readings on matters of the heart, says she is confident of embarking on a happy relationship of her own in future.

She uses techniques including mediumship, aura and colour therapy, cards, runes and crystals to help her clients.

When it comes to helping someone single find a suitable match, she said: 'Perhaps rather than saying I find love for clients, it would be more relevant to say I offer guidance that can assist every individual to understand their own potential, needs and requirements, as well as comprehend existing and up-coming possibilities, which can in turn lead to relevant conditions for romantic love.'

As for how she assesses if a couple are compatible, she explained: 'Intuitively, I examine and explore existing and potential trends and possibilities. In a practical and realistic way, I make observations and offer recommendations. Of course, I would never be judgemental, reach any unnecessary conclusions or make any decisions on anyone's behalf.' 

Interactive: Tamara has launched her own TV show so people can get in touch for a psychic reading

Giving enlightenment: Tamara and her team of experts can advise on matters of the heart as well as other issues such as financial woes and career dilemmas 

Tamara believes certain issues hold people back from finding love and she addresses these with her clients.

'Obviously, every case is individual. However, if I had to point in any specific direction, the following issues would be particularly valid: Inability to let go of an experience once it has run its course; difficulty in acknowledging and accepting the true potential within a given situation; assumption, based on hopes and desires rather than truth or reality,' she said.

Now Tamara hopes she can reach more people after launching her own interactive TV show, www.trusseautv.com, where she invites viewers to get in touch with their problems.

The viewer is given a psychic reading to help them towards enlightenment either with Tamara or another of her resident psychics and relationship experts.

As well as advising on love, they can also help with other areas such as career or financial woes and will cover holistic topics from reiki healing to karma. 

As well as helping people with their problems, Tamara hopes the show will banish some of the 'misconceptions' over psychic ability. 

She said: 'I hope in time, the true benefits and beauty of psychic endeavour can be more accurately understood.'
