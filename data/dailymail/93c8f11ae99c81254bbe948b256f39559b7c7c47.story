Residents of a New York neighbourhood have expressed their outrage after a grandfather abandoned his three young grandsons inside a burning apartment building.

Willy Wilcox, 66, is believed to have fled the fire wearing only a T-shirt and boxer shorts, leaving behind his three terrified grandchildren - Darian, eight, Tremaine, five, and Trevele, four.

Thankfully brave firefighters - including one rookie with just two months experience - were able to fight through the flames and save the young boys - but not young Trevele had passed out due to smoke inhalation.

Scene: Willy Wilcox is believed to have fled the burning apartment building (pictured), leaving behind his three terrified grandchildren - Darian, eight, Tremaine, five, and Trevele, four

Hero: Former army medic Justin Tallett, 27, had only been a firefighter for two months when he ventured inside the smoke-filled apartment and rescued unconscious and critically injured four-year-old Travele Belton

Due to the brave work of the fire crews, all three boys are expected to make a full recovery, although Trevelle had been in a critical condition and needed to be resuscitated on his way to hospital.

Now attention is turning to the cause of the fire and why Mr Wilcox was able to leave the property totally unharmed, but his young grandsons almost lost their lives.

Residents living on Brooklyn's Loring Avenue are furious about the incident, with one local - 33-year-old Omar White - quoted by the New York Daily News as saying: 'People here want to hurt him...They were like, "How could you leave those kids in the house?".'

Firefighters arriving at the scene at around 11am yesterday morning were themselves surprised to find Mr Wilcox standing casually in the lobby while his grandchildren were trapped upstairs.

He reportedly told fire crews that he left his apartment's front door open for the boys to get out.

Lucky escape: Travelle's two older brothers were still conscious and had already been plucked from a broken fourth floor window (pictured) by fire teams using a bucket ladder on the outside of the building

The young boys' aunt Amanda Ridley, 51, said she had 'no idea' why Mr Wilcox had abandoned them, adding: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if he was drunk and sleeping because I do know him to drink...I don’t think he’s capable of taking care of kids.'

Speaking to the newspaper at Brookdale Hospital, where the boys are being treated, Ms Ridley said she thought the blaze started by accident when four-year-old Trevele lit something on the stove.

A formal investigation into the fire is now underway, with police understood to be looking into the line that burns on Trevele's body suggest he was somehow responsible.

Among the firefighters from Ladder 107 who attended the scene was 27-year-old Justin Tallett - a former army medic who has only been in the job for two months.

Tallet is understood to be responsible for entering the smoke-filled apartment and finding critically injured Travelle unconscious beneath a blanket as the flames closed in around him.

Travelle's two older brothers were still conscious and had already been plucked from a broken fourth floor window by fire teams using a bucket ladder on the outside of the building.

Although the four-year-old is expected to survive, he has been transferred away from Brookdale University Hospital where his brothers are being treated.

Travelle will now recieve specialist care at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell.
