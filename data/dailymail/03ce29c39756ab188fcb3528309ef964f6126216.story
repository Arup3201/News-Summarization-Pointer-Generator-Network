Three inspirational women who have campaigned for equal rights and an end to violence in Liberia and Yemen were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today.

Liberian, Leymah Gbowee, who mobilised fellow women against the country’s civil war by organising a 'sex strike' was named along with her nation's president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.

The third recipient who will share the prize worth more than $1.5 million  was Tawakkul Karman, who has campaigned tirelessly for women's rights in Yemen.

Johnson Sirleaf and Liberian 'peace warrior' Leymah Gbowee have jointly 
won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize

Prior to the announcement bizarre rumours had circulated that the award would go to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, reflecting the role of social networking sites in the Arab Spring uprisings

Announcing the award committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said:   'We
cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women 
obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all 
levels of society.

'The Nobel Peace Prize for 2011 is to be divided in three equal parts between Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation in peace-building work.'  

Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, is Africa’s first freely elected female president and the 24th President of Liberia.

Business as usual: Nobel Prize winnerTawakul Karman demonstrating in the Yemeni capital Sana'a today. She has received numerous threats for her work campaigning for women's rights

She served as Minister of Finance 
under President William Tolbert from 1979 until the 1980 coup d'état and
faces re-election for a second term as president on Tuesday.   

Her
fellow Liberian Gbowee mobilized and organized women across ethnic and 
religious dividing lines to bring an end to the civil war in Liberia, 
and to ensure women’s participation in elections.

'I believe we (Gbowee and I) both accept this on behalf of the Liberian people, and the credit goes to the Liberian people,' Johnson-Sirleaf told reporters outside her private residence in Liberia's capital.   

Gbowee was on a book tour in the United States, her Accra, Ghana-based office said.   

Tawakul Karman is a Yemeni politician and human rights activist who created the group Women Journalists Without Chains (WJWC) in 2005.

She said today the award was a victory for Yemen and all Arab Spring revolutions and a message that the era of Arab dictatorships was over.   

'This is a victory for the Yemeni woman. Today the whole world can hear our joy. I am very very happy and I thank God for this award,'  the 32-year-old mother of three said.    

'This is a victory for the Yemeni people, for the Yemeni revolution and all the Arab revolutions. This is a message that the era of Arab dictatorships is over. This is a message to this regime and all the despotic regimes that no voice can drown out the voice of freedom and dignity.'

Mr Jagland added: 'In the most trying circumstances, both before and during the Arab Spring, Tawakkul Karman has played a leading part in the struggle for women’s rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen.'    

'It is the Norwegian Nobel 
Committee’s hope that the prize to Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee 
and Tawakkul Karman will help to bring an end to the suppression of 
women that still occurs in many countries, and to realise the great 
potential for democracy and peace that women can represent.'   

Committee
chairman Jagland had fueled speculation that the award would go to 
Facebook CEO  Zuckerberg after remarks he made during an interview with 
the Associated Press.

He said: 'For me and the committee it is quite obvious if you look at the world today and see what is happening out there.

'What are the major forces pushing the world in the right direction?'

He added that the winner would be 'obvious' and would reflect 'the most positive development' of the year.

Commentators
were quick to link his words to the Arab Spring Uprisings and more 
specifically the role of social networking sites such as Facebook and 
its rival Twitter in spreading the dissent.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has  welcomed the announcement that the women received the Nobel Peace Prize, saying it was 'a testament to the power of women.'

'Above all, it underscores the vital role that women play in the advancement of peace and security, development, and human rights,' he said.

'I really congratulate all three winners from the bottom of my heart.'

Praise: 'We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society,' committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said today

ELLEN JOHNSON SIRLEAF

Politician Johnson-Sirleaf earned the nickname 'Iron Lady' by challenging warlord Charles Taylor for the presidency in 1997 during Liberia's brutal civil war. She lost by a landslide, but that never shook her resolve.    

She won the 2005 presidential run-off against football icon George Weah, who alleged fraud although the polls received a clean bill of health from observers. She was sworn in as Africa's first elected female head of state in January 2006.    

Johnson-Sirleaf vowed to create a 'government of inclusion' to heal the wounds of war and toured the streets to win over Liberia's poor youth, many of them former child soldiers who believe Weah was cheated.     

In January 2010, she went back on her campaign promise to be president for only one term when she announced she would contest the 2011 presidential election, to be held on October 11.    

She has won widespread international praise for her work rebuilding Liberia, but is still struggling to convince many in the country that change is coming fast enough.   

LEYMAH GBOWEE  

Activist Leymah Gbowee, 39, mobilised and organised women across ethnic and religious divides to help bring an end to the war in Liberia and to ensure women's participation in elections.     

Following the 2003 peace treaty, her network encouraged many more women to vote and was instrumental in the victory of Johnson-Sirleaf.     

Since 2004, Gbowee has served as a commissioner on Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.    

Since 2006, Gbowee has been executive director of Women in Peace and Security Network - Africa, an organization that works with women in Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone to promote peace, literacy, and electoral politics.   

TAWAKUL KARMAN  

Both before and during the 'Arab Spring', protester and campaigner Tawakul Karman, 32, has played a leading part in the struggle for women's rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen.    

Founder in 2005 and chairwoman of Women Journalists without Chains, Tawakul Karman is a Yemeni journalist and activist who has devoted herself to the fight for media freedom. She is also a member of the Islamist party Islah Was.    

A thorn in the side of the government, she was briefly arrested early this year after leading protests against autocratic Arab rulers.    

She vowed in February to galvanise a youth-led uprising against President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled Yemen for 33 years.'We started rallies before Tunisia's revolution and were demanding reforms and other rights.

But after Tunisia, we realised the solution is for this regime to go,' she said.
