Academics who said Eastern European migrants had made a substantial contribution to the public finances were guilty of ‘schoolboy errors’, it was claimed last night.

A report by Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini, two researchers from University College London (UCL), was given blanket coverage by the BBC when it was published last month, and hailed as proof that immigration has a positive economic impact on Britain.

But last night their study was condemned as ‘fatally flawed’ by one of the country’s most senior statisticians.

Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of 
Statistics at UCL, said the study was ‘obviously driven to make the case
 it claims to have made’.

He
 added: ‘If any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but 
assumption-based calculations, the last word he/she would have used to 
describe the  estimates is “precise” – unless exhaustion had affected 
judgment.

‘Most
 of the underlying crude assumptions that the all-embracing approach has
 been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that 
might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to 
make the case it claims to have made.’

Prof
 Stone and statistician Nigel Williams point out flaws in the paper’s 
findings in new research published by the Civitas think-tank.

The
 independent analysis accuses Dustmann and Frattini of using 
questionable methods to process the data, having an ‘inadequate 
understanding’ of the data and ‘significantly overstating their case’.

Small changes to the ‘large assumptions’ about benefit claims the report was based on could make the positive contribution supposedly made by migrants disappear.

Prof Dustmann was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from Poland and other Eastern European nations would come after controls were dropped in 2004. In the event, more than one million arrived in almost a decade.

Unclear picture: The Government has not revealed estimates about how many Romanians or Bulgarians would arrive in the UK from today onwards

Civitas director David Green said: 
‘The UCL study’s claims were held up by many as evidence that 
immigration from Romania and Bulgaria is unquestionably a good thing.

‘But,
 as our forensic analysis by two respected statisticians shows, the 
study’s methodology was flawed and its findings were highly 
questionable.

‘The authors made schoolboy errors in their handling of statistics which fell short of the professional standards recognised by statisticians.

'It is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like UCL can only see what they want to see.

‘Yet again the BBC has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information. It has the resources to double-check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices.’
