One of the most popular houses ever featured on Channel 4's Grand Designs is on sale for £5,000 less than it cost to build 10 years ago.

Tony and Jo Moffat spent £380,000 on their loch-side home in the village of Kilcreggan, near Glasgow, overrunning their budget by £150,000.

But despite a decade passing which included a property bubble, a crash and another boom, The Longhouse is now on sale for just £375,000 - despite its striking original design and uninterrupted views over the Firth of Clyde.

Spectacular: Designed to look like a modern-day Nordic longhouse, this home in Kilcreggan, Argyll, has uninterrupted views of Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde. But its owners Tony and Jo Moffat, who featured on the Channel 4 show Grand Designs, overran their budget for building it by £150,000 and it is now on sale for less than it cost

Novel: The couple bought their plot of land on a steep slope for just £35,000, but the costs of their build soon spiralled beyond the original budget of £230,000

Bedroom: Timber features heavily throughout the three-bedroom home, which housed the couple and their young daughter for almost a decade before they sold up

The couple's mission to build the house from scratch in 2003 featured in the fourth series of the Channel 4 property show.

The classical musicians, who had a young daughter when they started their build, found their plot on a steep slope overlooking Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde for just £35,000.

Using an oak frame, they imitated the look of a Nordic longhouse and set the home in several terrace 'steps' so it would look as though it was bursting out of the hill.

But like many of the avant-garde designs on the show, the three-bedroom house soon ran into difficulties. Work took longer than expected and the costs spiralled out of control, having to slow down over the chilly northern winter of 2003.

Mr Moffat told the programme at the time: 'You get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go, "I can't pay this".

'At one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough. It was a balance as to what would make us happier, not having the debt or having the house. But we hung in and tightened the belt and got through that patch.'

His wife added: 'It's that rollercoaster feeling where you just want to get off.'

A longhouse with a view: Despite its rural location, the house is an hour's commute from Glasgow on a route which involves taking the traditional Kilcreggan ferry

Idyll: The living room is under a vaulted ceiling with eight roof lights - but despite the avant-garde design, the home still costs less than a London flat

Property agent Andrew Perratt said: 'The market in Scotland is definitely in recovery mode now but it's far from overheating compared to other parts of the UK'

Despite the setbacks, the couple completed their home and it attracted high praise from hard-to-please presenter Kevin McCloud, who listed it in his 20 favourite Grand Designs homes of all time.

He described the longhouse as 'a beautiful, 
romantic building, like a ship or an ark even, and it’s a well-crafted 
piece of architecture'.

An hour from Glasgow on a route which includes a traditional ferry, the family house has an L-shaped living room, breathtaking sea views, a vaulted ceiling with six roof lights, a study and a separate 'intimate' living area with a wood-burning stove.

It first featured on the property show in March 2004 and the couple were revisited in 2007 - and suffered a fairly major setback when its roof blew off during severe gales which battered Scotland in December 2012.

Now it has failed to attract a higher price than it cost to build.

Property agent Andrew Perratt, of 
Savills, told MailOnline he expected it to sell for around £375,000, which is the
 'offers over' price as is common in Scotland, or up to five per cent 
more.

However, the low cost 
has tempted several buyers from England - as the spectacular home is 
less pricy than an average flat in London, according to the house prices
 website Zoopla.

Beloved: The property show fronted by Kevin McCloud (pictured), which has featured more than 100 homes, focused on the house in 2004 and again in 2007

Tony Moffat (centre with Kevin McCloud and Jo) said at the time: 'You get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go, "I can't pay this"...At one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough. It was a balance as to what would make us happier, not having the debt or having the house'

'The 
property market in Scotland is definitely in recovery mode now but it's 
far from overheating compared to other parts of the UK,' he said. 'We've had a lot 
of interest and most of it has been from south of the border.'

He added: 'The price we're asking was set at the market rate, so it didn't take into account the cost to build.'

Other houses from the Channel 4 show have had a mixed fate, with some soaring in value while other fall victim to the so-called 'curse of Grand Designs'.

A
 four-bedroom house in Bristol dubbed the 'Modernist Sugar Cube' 
featured on the show in 2008 and cost £775,000, but has since sold for 
£1.5million.

And a two-bed 'low-carbon' home in Clapham Park, south London, featured in 2012 and 
was put on the market the next year at almost £1million more than it cost to 
build.

But not all have been so lucky. Last summer it was reported a nine-storey water tower in Kennington, south London, had £2million knocked off its asking price after initially being offered for £6.5million.

Owners Leigh Osborne and Graham Voce bought the Grade II listed building, part of a former factory site, for £380,000 and spent almost £2million converting it from a crumbling ruin into a home.
