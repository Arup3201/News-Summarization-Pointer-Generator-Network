Frank Lampard finally made it to a New York City game on Saturday night, but his new club must have wished they had the Manchester City midfielder on the pitch rather than in the stands as they lost 1-0 to Sporting Kansas City.

Barclays Premier League legend Lampard is set to link up with his new club on July 1, but he has been using the international break to check out the city he will call home and to visit the Yankee Stadium to take in what it will be like playing in Major League Soccer.

But the MLS new boys couldn't put on a show for their soon-to-arrive designated player and his fiancée Christine Bleakley on Saturday night, crashing to their first defeat of the season against the visitors from Kansas.

Lampard has spent the season at Manchester City after agreeing his Stateside move last summer, but the half-season 'loan' to the Premier League champions caused controversy when it was revealed that the midfielder had instead signed for the entire campaign in England, making him miss the MLS' start.

Having retired from international football, the 36-year-old had been able to use the break to check out Manhattan properties ahead of the game before jetting back to Manchester to help out in City's bid to catch his former club Chelsea in the title race

It was reported that Lampard could have even headed to New York for good this month after finding it difficult to break back into Manuel Pellegrini's side, but that now seems unlikely.

'I’m certain we’ll get to spend some time together,' New York City FC coach Jason Kreis said of Lampard earlier in the week.

'It’s really exciting, obviously, that he’s going to take that time and make the effort to come over and see us this weekend when he has a break.

'We’ll look forward to spending some time with him and also getting him around the guys some more. I think that’s important.'
