A woman who went on a fairground ride at a festival has been left feeling dizzy even a year later.

Bobbie Lane, 26, was at Reading Festival when she decided to go on the ride, which flipped her and her friends around at high speeds.

But while the rest of her friends quickly recovered from the Superbowl ride, Ms Lane did not.

Bobbie Lane, 26, went on a fairground ride (much faster than the one she is pictured sitting in) a year ago and has been feeling dizzy ever since. She has now been diagnosed with Migraine Variant Balance Disorder

She has felt unsteady on her feet ever since, describing the sensation as like having too much to drink.

Ms Lane, of Ash, Kent, has been diagnosed with Migraine Variant Balance Disorder, (also known as Migraine Associated Vertigo), which is a condition that affects her memory and leaves sufferers feeling permanently 'drunk'.

The waltzer-style ride she went on spins riders in separate carts, while being raised into the air.

She
 said: 'The ride was fun and terrifying all at the same time. I had been
 on something similar once before, so I didn’t think anything of it, 
really.

'A couple of minutes after I got off the ride, I was still a bit dizzy, which I thought was strange.

'But I carried on at the festival, thinking I was feeling wobbly because I’d had too much fun in the sun.

'When I got home I was still dizzy - it felt like I was permanently at sea.'

When her condition deteriorated, she went to her GP, who immediately referred her to a neurologist.

Migraine Associated Vertigo manifests itself in different ways in different people.

Many people feel permanently dizzy, are intolerant to motion, lose their sense of balance and have vertigo attacks.

Some sufferers have 'sick headaches,' sensitivity to light and noise, neck and eye pain, and nausea.

Fluctuating hormones, certain foods, stress and weather changes often make the condition worse.

It is often suggested that people cut out certain foods, such as cheese and other dairy products, MSG, smoked meats, alcohol, chocolate, nuts, drinks containing caffeine and some fruits, including plums, banana and citrus.

Sufferers are often put on medication.

Ms Lane said: 'I had always suffered from migraines, but the doctor asked me if I had done any extreme sports or gone on rollercoasters.

'I told him about the ride at Reading, and he said that was probably the cause.

'It’s changed my entire life. I’ve had to quit the job I spent four years in and I loved because I have to avoid all stress, and my diet has changed significantly - there’s a list of foods I can’t eat any more as long as my arm.'

In a bid to attempt to control her 
permanent dizziness, the former charity worker has been told to give up 
alcohol, chocolate, citrus fruits, dairy, bananas and many other foods.

Ms Lane has not yet been tested to see whether she suffers 
hypersensitivity to a number of different foods that are believed to 
trigger migraines, and has therefore has been advised to cut them all out of
 her diet.

She said: 'I
 think it's the case of stopping me eating any of the foods that might 
cause me to have another migraine, which will obviously make my 
dizziness worse.

'Some of 
the foods are quite strange - like I'm not allowed to eat  salad cream. I
 think a lot of people get put on the same diet as me.

'The
 foods can agitate migraines because they're hard to digest. The doctors
 are going to work out what will trigger my condition more and then 
hopefully I'll be able to have a more normal diet.'

Commenting
 on the condition, Dr Andy Dowson, Director of King's Headache Service, at King's College London, who is not Ms Lane's doctor, said: 
'Migraine sufferers are quite often tested to see whether they suffer 
hypersensitivity to certain foods.

'If a patient were to be very sensitive to these foods, it may trigger an attack.'

She was at Reading Festival when she decided to go on the ride called the Superbowl (similar to the one pictured) which flipped her and her friends around at high speeds, in a number of rotating cars

The disorder is curable, but Ms Lane does not know when she may make a full recovery.

'Day-to-day I'm on quite a lot of medication, my memory is pretty bad and I get really tired,' she said.

'My head feels like it is floating a lot. It’s a really hard thing to explain, I have never felt anything like it before.

'My balance is awful, I am doing physiotherapy to try and retrain it so it comes back.

'It affects my walking too, sometimes I will just be standing there and I will lose my balance for no reason. It is literally like I am drunk.'

'I certainly don’t blame the fairground - unfortunately it’s just one of those things. I live in hope that one day I’ll recover and then I can get my old life back.'

She now hopes to start a charity to raise awareness of her little-known condition.
