Paul Lambert will speak with referees’ chief Mike Riley after Gabriel Agbonlahor became the third Aston Villa player to receive a straight red card in seven weeks.

Villa will appeal against Lee Mason’s decision to send off Agbonlahor for using excessive force in what seemed to be a 50-50 challenge with Ashley Young. He appears to have a strong case.

Lambert said Young had admitted to Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan that he had actually fouled Agbonlahor, rather than the other way round.

Aston Villa boss Pau Lambert has said he is going to appeal the red card given to striker Agbonlahor

Christian Benteke was sent off for raising his hands at Tottenham’s Ryan Mason in November and Kieran Richardson was dismissed last week for a dangerous tackle on West Brom midfielder Stephane Sessegnon.

Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards, but sometimes he sees ones which are not there. When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who made the foul. Both were committed and the Villa man’s momentum meant he caught Young on the follow-through. Mason would not have been influenced by United’s players surrounding him and he had already decided. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal. FULL REVIEW HERE.

Lambert is concerned Villa could be getting a bad reputation. ‘We shouldn’t. It’s not right,’ he said.

‘I probably will have a call (to Riley). I’ll find out exactly what is going on. The Kieran Richardson one I don’t have a problem. The one against United I certainly have a problem.

‘The two of them went for a fair challenge. When their lad says he fouled Gabby, that’s where it falls down.

‘You have a fourth official and a linesman. In that moment, that magnitude of a game, you’ve got to be 100 per cent right.’

Lambert confirmed that Villa would be appealing against the 65th-minute dismissal.
