'The purpose of the day is for our school to get together for an enjoyable two hours of activities and provide an opportunity for students, teachers and parents to interact cooperatively,' the note sent by the North Hill Elementary School in Rochester Hills, Michigan reads. 'Since we believe that all of our children are winners, the need for athletic ability and the competitive 'urge to win' will be kept to a minimum. The real reward will be the enjoyment and good feelings of participation.'

Bennett Staph, who says she is a parent with a child at the school, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. 

Parents of students at North Hill Elementary in Rochester Hills, Michigan, have been informed that all students are 'winners,' therefore the 'competitive "urge to win" will be kept to a minimum' at the school's annual field day

The parent of a student at North Hill said the note left her 'speechless' and she was 'proud' of her daughter for 'pointing out the ridiculousness of it'

'[My daughter] showed this to me tonight regarding her school’s field day event,' Staph wrote, according to Progressives Today. 'I was even proud of her for pointing out the ridiculousness of it.

'I am speechless…the ‘urge to win’ will be kept at a minimum,' she continued. 'What are we teaching our children? Everyone isn’t a winner, there are winners and losers. The kids that win and get awards drive those that don’t to do better.'
