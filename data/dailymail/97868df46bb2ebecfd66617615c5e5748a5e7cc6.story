American children eat as much salt as adults — about 1,000 milligrams too much, or the same amount as in just one Big Mac – with its effects in some cases tripling children’s blood pressure rates.

While extra salt is already linked with higher blood pressure, even in kids, government research says those who are overweight and obese may be the most vulnerable to its effects, according to the new findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Previous research has shown similar results in adults but studies on salt, weight and blood pressure are scarce in children, the research published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday revealed.

Consumption: The recommended daily salt or sodium intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily, or about 2,300 milligrams though on average, kids were found consuming 3,300 milligrams daily

The CDC researchers looked at data on 6,200 kids aged 8 to 18 involved in 2003-08 national health surveys. The children were asked twice over several days to detail all foods they'd eaten the previous day; the researchers calculated salt intake from their answers.

Overall, 15 per cent had either high blood pressure or slightly elevated blood pressure called prehypertension.

Those who ate the most salt faced double the risk of having elevated blood pressure, compared with those who ate few salty foods showing that for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in the children's diets, a one-point increase in blood pressure was found.

Among overweight or obese kids, the risk was more than triple, showing that for 1,000 mg of sodium consumed, there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points.

The recommended daily salt or sodium 
intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily, or about 
2,300 milligrams. On average, study kids ate 3,300 milligrams daily.

According to previous data from the CDC, 
U.S. adults consume 3,466 mg of sodium per day by comparison.

CDC
researcher Quanhe Yang says it's unclear why heavier kids would be more
sensitive to salt but it could be due to obesity-related hormone 
changes.

The results raise concerns because studies have shown that elevated blood pressure in childhood, even just prehypertension, can lead to full-fledged high blood pressure in adulthood and potentially premature heart disease.

'We shouldn't underestimate the potential harms of a 1-mm increase in systolic blood pressure,' said Dr. Frederick Kaskel, chief of pediatric nephrology at Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York who was involved in the research.

'The antecedents of adult cardiovascular disease are seen early on in the pediatric age group.'

Prehypertension and high blood pressure in children younger than 17 depend on age, height and gender.

In those 18 and up, readings between 120 over 80 and 140 over 90 are prehypertension; 140 over 90 and higher is high blood pressure.

While health authorities across the globe warn consumers to cut back on dietary salt, a number of recent studies have suggested that not getting enough salt can be as harmful as getting too much.

Getting a rise: For every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in children's diets, a one-point increase in blood pressure was found while for overweight or obese children there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points

The salt industry has pounced on that research, saying the dietary guidelines for sodium intake are flawed and should be withdrawn.

Dr. Michael Alderman of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York cautioned that it's not clear that cutting back on sodium will do most kids any good.

'There is nothing in this paper - and there is no information that I'm familiar with - that suggests reducing sodium intake is of value for people eating an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day,' he told Reuters Health.

Alderman said he has been an adviser to the Salt Institute, which represents the industry, and received $750 from the group in 1995. He said he has no ties to the group today.

Graf said bread is the biggest source of dietary sodium in the U.S., adding that deli meats also contain a lot of the ingredient.

Eating a healthy diet - including whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and fresh fish and meats - will automatically reduce sodium intake, she noted.
