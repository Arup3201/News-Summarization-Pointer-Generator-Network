When asking a father for his daughter's hand in marriage, the worst scenario most young men are likely to encounter is a grilling by their potential father-in-law.

But when Jake Thompson asked for Steve Bennett’s daughter Hannah’s hand at Christmas, he got more than he bargained for.

Steve agreed on the provision that Jake accompanied him on a planned charity trek to the North Pole.

Steve and Jake embarked on an epic 10 day trek which saw them walk, ski and sledge to the North Pole in temperatures of -50 degrees Celsius

Jake and Hannah have been together since they were childhood sweethearts

Having been childhood sweethearts with Steve’s daughter Hannah and determined to marry her, Jake, 23, who lives with Hannah in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire had no choice but to agree.

So, last month, he found himself jetting out to the 89th latitude (the last degree) along with Steve, who lives in Redditch, before embarking on an epic 10 day trek which saw them walk, ski and sledge to the North Pole in temperatures of -50 degrees celsius.

Guided by Alan Chambers, the first Briton to walk unaided to the North Pole, the team successfully navigated their 100kg sledges through the moving ice of the Arctic Circle.

Steve Bennett, CEO of Birmingham based jewellery company The Genuine Gemstone Company is proud of his business’s family routes.

Steve and Jake formed half of the only British team expected to make it to The North Pole this year, battling through temperatures as low as -50

As well as being initiated into the family, Jake helped raise in excess of £30,000 for the Colourful Life Foundation and National Osteoporosis Society

Steve rather humbly says of his amazing trip: 'It will be a great story to tell our future children!'

So much so, that he felt this latest venture, in the name of charities The Colourful Life Foundation and National Osteoporosis Society would be the perfect initiation into initiation into the family.

Speaking about his decision to recruit Jake to the challenge, Steve said: 'This seemed to be the perfect opportunity for Jake to prove his commitment to marrying my daughter!

'But on a serious note, it's a great challenge for a great cause. I needed someone I can rely on during those dark and difficult moments and Jake proved to be the man to accompany me.'

Jake added,'Hannah and I have been together for eight years so I didn’t think there would be any objection from Steve.

'When he told me, I panicked but there was no way I was going to back out. And it’ll be a great story to tell our future children!'
