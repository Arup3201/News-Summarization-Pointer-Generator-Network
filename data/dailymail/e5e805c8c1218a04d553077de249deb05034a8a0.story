She has faced her fair share of scrutiny in her five years as a designer.

And Victoria Beckham, who is finally being embraced by the fashion world, reveals she will showcase a flawless range of tailored separates at New York Fashion Week today.

The fashion designer, 39, famed for her fitted pencil dresses, says she will be unveiling a 'paparazzi-proof' collection that is designed to flatter from every angle.

Her 'long and lean' FW14 offering will feature sweeping long coats with pleated inserts and tuxedo-style gilets cut low at the back - to ensure you look as good leaving as you do arriving.

Victoria says she spent a lot of time making sure the leg-lengthening trousers were 'cut correctly, to really get as long and lean a leg as physically possible.'

'No one is going to say no to a nice long leg,' she said at an exclusive preview for The Sunday Times.

A striking pair of tomato red skinny trousers, which gather lightly at the ankle and fall halfway down the foot when wearing a high-heel, create a clever leg-lengthening illusion.

Victoria says she has layered cashmere vests under evening dresses this season to 'make the red-carpet looks feel really cool'.

When she first appeared on the fashion scene, Victoria focussed very much on form-fitting dresses, but as of SS14's amazing display of very wearable separates, she's now tapping into a whole new market - and wardrobe.

Amazing at designing well-tailored pieces, she wears them well too, so this new collection promises to showcase some standout structure.

The fashionista knows how to do a good coat, too: From her long-line blazers, to her half-ponyskin delights from AW13. The fashion world is waiting with baited breath to see what she has to offer for this winter. 

Her runway show, part of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York, is scheduled for 10am (3pm GMT), off-site at Café Rouge, 145 West 32nd Street. Husband David Beckham is expected to attend.

In late 2013, Victoria unveiled her ICON (L) polo shift dress, £1,650 (R) cap sleeve v neck fitted dress, £1,050

Mother-of-four Victoria, who once said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes, will spend this week, one of the busiest in the
 fashion calendar, in flat shoes.

She revealed she has gave up her high-heel addiction in the run up to New York fashion week in favour of a pair of Stubbs & Wootton velvet slippers after sharing a picture with her Twitter and Instagram followers.

Meanwhile, husband David announced on Wednesday that he is setting up a new Major League Soccer club in Miami.

The Beckhams, who moved back to London after David left LA Galaxy in 2012, are now looking forward to spending time in the Florida city.

The former footballer - who retired as a player in May 2013 - said his wife and four children, Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, are excited about exploring the city.

A Beckham family spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Victoria and the children are thrilled by this next adventure in their life story, as a family they love America and are all very excited to explore a new city and spend time in beautiful Miami.'

Victoria's first London boutique opens in the autumn.
