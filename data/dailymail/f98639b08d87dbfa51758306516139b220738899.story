An LAPD officer may have mistook a fellow officer's 'bean bag' shotgun for real gunfire when he shot a Corvette driver dead live on TV. 

Brian Beaird, 51, led police on an hour-long high-speed chase through the streets of Los Angeles last night but died from a gunshot wound after crashing his silver Corvette and trying to escape on foot.

Video captured the moment when Beaird seemed to speed through a red light and crashed into the back half of a Nissan Maxima.

LAPD is now investigating claims that when one officer fired a non-lethal 'bean bag' round, another mistook it for gunfire and used a real weapon.

The end of the road: The driver pictured escaping this totaled silver Corvette was fatally shot by police after leading them on a high-speed chase through Los Angeles Friday night

'The suspect got out of the vehicle and at that point, something occurred that prompted the officer-involved shooting,' Lt Neiman said.

When the car chase was broadcast live by KTLA-TV, video showed the man getting out of his car, running around the back of the Corvette and heading up East Olympic Blvd before being shot, clutching his stomach and falling to the ground.

Lt Neiman says there was 'great concern that he was going to hurt someone severely'.

LAPD Cmdr. Alexander Smith told 10news: 
'Policy dictates that the officer using the non-lethal bean bag shotgun 
notify other officers so they don't think lethal force is being used'.

He added that part of the investigation will be whether verbal warning was given.

Beaird's brother John said during the chase, Beaird called his father asking, 'Why are they after me? I didn't do anything.'

Officers from three police agencies tailed the man for more than an hour on Friday night starting at 9pm when police in South Gate attempted to pull him over for reckless driving and a possible DUI. 

Won't stop: The car chase started around 9pm in South Gate when police tried to pull over the unidentified driver of this silver Corvette for reckless driving and a possible DUI

Tracking: When the man refused to yield, police pursued the vehicle as it made its way through the streets of Los Angeles for more than an hour

When the driver refused to pull over, police followed him in cars and with a helicopter as he spend through Cudahy, Huntington Park, South Gate, Walnut Park and into South Los Angeles.

Sky9's Meghan Reyes reported that the man was often driving without his headlights on and 'just driving in circles'.

The man's corvette was also outfitted with special tires that resisted puncture when police tried to use a spike strip to stop him.

Crash: The Corvette's tires were impervious to police spike strips so it was only when he rammed into another car that the chase came to a halt at the intersection of Olympic Boulevard and Los Angeles Street

Damages: The T-bone crash sent the other car barreling into a fire hydrant which sent water shooting into the air and spilling out onto the street

The chase finally came to an end around 10:30pm when he sped through a light and hit another driver crossing the intersection in front of him in a T-bone collision.

The corvette spun all the way around before stopping on the side of the road at the intersection of South Los Angeles St and East Olympic Blvd. 

The other car was thrown into a fire hydrant which sent water shooting into the air and spilling onto the street.

Police say the other driver was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

On foot: After the crash, the DUI suspect tries to drive his totaled car but crashes it into a telephone pole while backing up and it won't move. He is then seen getting out of the car

Taken out: When broadcast live, the man was seen running around the back of his car before being shot by police, clutching his stomach and falling over on the sidewalk

Beaird attempted to back up his Corvette and continue driving but rammed into a light post and couldn't get the car to move.

He stumbled out of the vehicle and attempted to run down East Olympic Blvd before being shot by police and crumpling over.

CBS 2's Melanie Woodrow was at the scene, and reported seeing paramedics doing 'vigorous' chest compressions on the driver.

His death was not confirmed until early Saturday morning.
