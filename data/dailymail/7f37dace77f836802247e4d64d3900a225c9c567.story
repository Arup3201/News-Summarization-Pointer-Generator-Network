A young soldier on leave ahead of his first ever Afghanistan tour of duty was killed in a road accident on Christmas Day.

Edward Heal, a 19-year-old trooper in the Kings Royal Hussars, was hit by a car in North Somerset after leaving a pub in the early hours of Christmas Day.

The tank gunner had been training for a tour of duty in Afghanistan due to start in March.

The soldier's heartbroken mother, Elaine Coles, 50, said her son had gone for a drink on Christmas Eve with his stepbrother Sam, 24, at the Bristol pub in Clevedon, Somerset.

Holding back tears, Mrs Coles told the Western Daily Press: 'I have been worried about him going to Afghanistan ever since he joined up.

'He always said to me there was more chance of him being hit by a car than being killed while on duty.

'I can't believe it. It shouldn't have happened. His Christmas presents are still there by the Christmas tree.'
