Galatasaray have bid £10million for Cardiff midfielder Gary Medel.

The Chilean’s representatives had already agreed terms with Inter Milan having anticipated a deal being reached between Cardiff and the Italians who wanted an initial loan with view to £9m move.

However the Turkish outfit have now entered the running to sign the 26-year-old in hope that the former Sevilla man will add some steel to their midfield.

Medel, who impressed at the World Cup with Chile in a defensive role, played 34 league games for the Bluebirds last season in what could prove to be his first and last campaign at the Cardiff City Stadium.

The holding midfielder was unable to stop Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side from slipping back into the Championship as the Welsh outfit finished rock bottom in the Premier League.

Cardiff are likely to give Medel the chance to choose between the two sides.
