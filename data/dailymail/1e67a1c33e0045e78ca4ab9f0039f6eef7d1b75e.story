French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler's boss has launched an astonishing attack on her by claiming she caused him 'nothing but problems' and was 'an unpinned grenade.'

Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere also said he would not be renewing the 47-year-old's contract at the end of the year.

It is the latest in a barrage of attacks aimed at Ms Trierweiler since Francois Hollande became head of state in May.

Mr Lagardere's comments have been revealed in a new biography of the millionaire media tycoon by journalist Jacqueline Remy.

Ms Remy said it was suggested to Mr Lagardere in June that having the French First Lady as an employee would surely help him get 'the ear of the president'.

But he is quoted as replying: 'Are you kidding? Up until now, she's caused us nothing but problems.'

He went on: 'She's like an unpinned grenade.'

And Paris Match would be 'letting her go' next year to avoid any 'conflict of interest', he said.

He made his comments just weeks after Ms Trierweiler had attacked her own magazine for putting her picture on the front cover without informing her first.

She said at the time: 'Would have been nice to have been informed in advance, especially by one's own employer.'

Ms Trierweiler has also attracted wide criticism in the French media in recent months.

Just weeks after Mr Hollande took office, she sparked outrage by tweeting her support for a candidate standing in parliamentary elections against Segolene Royal, the mother of the president's four children.

Ms Royal lost the election and blamed Ms Trierweiler for wrecking her political career.

Furious prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told Ms Trierweiler that she should 'know her place' and Mr Hollande's eldest son Thomas Hollande said he had disowned her.

Laurent Greilsamer, author and former news editor of leading daily Le Monde, then launched a blistering volley of slurs at Ms Trierweiler in his new biography called The Favorite.

He wrote: ‘As I see it, you have shown yourself to be not normal, snooty, infatuated, unpredictable.

And a third book by author Christophe Jakubyszyn called Valerie Trierweiler: The Heart of Power promises to reveal 'the driving force behind this mysterious woman' when it is published in October.

Mr Hollande has publicly expressed his own disapproval of her antics during a televised Bastille Day address to the nation on July 14.

The president said: 'I am for a clear distinction between public and private life. I believe private matters should be regulated in private and I have asked those close to me to respect this.'

Mr Hollande and former lover Ms Royal lived together for 28 years before the president left her for Ms Trierweiler in 2005.

News magazine L'Express wrote recently of Ms Trierweiler: 'For her, Segolene Royal remains the object of profound and irrational jealousy that complicates political relations.

'It is almost impossible to even speak about the woman in front of her, even from a purely political angle. It's stronger than she is.'
