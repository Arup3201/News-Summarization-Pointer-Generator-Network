Two manhole covers were blown into the air by an underground explosion which led to temporary power cuts to over 1,000 homes.

Fire crews raced to a street in Oldham, Greater Manchester after flames were seen coming from two manholes around one mile apart shortly after midnight last night.

The blast, caused by a faulty underground cable, was the latest of a series of manhole explosions around the UK.

Manhole covers on Ripponden Road, Oldham were blown into the air last night as flames leapt into the street

Locals said it was lucky the explosion happened late on a Sunday night as the busy street would have been full of vehicles and pedestrians  at daytime.

Retired Mavis Lloyd, 73, said: 'I was sat watching TV and saw an orange flash through the curtains and heard a loud bang. The TV went off and the lamps went out.

'Just as I looked outside a massive flash of flames came out of the manhole. The flames came about 5ft high. The manhole cover had been blown out and gone down the road.

'A car had stopped by the side of the road. He must have driven over the hole and it exploded as he went over. He said when it happened he thought he was going to die.'

More than 1,000 homes and business lost power for more than five minutes after the explosion and electrical engineers are now on the scene.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called to Ripponden Road shortly after midnight, where fires were seen coming from manholes.

The blazes were out by the time firefighters arrived and they secured the scene for engineers from Electricity North West.

Earlier this year, fire crews were called to central London after a manhole cover exploded, destroying a van

A spokesman for the firm said: 'The fault, which occurred on a piece of equipment underneath the pavement, caused external damage on site, but we would like to assure customers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare and we regularly maintain our underground network to ensure customers across the North West receive a reliable supply of electricity.'

The blast, which left no one injured, is the latest in a series of similiar incidents in recent months.

In October, a huge fireball burst through a manhole cover in Islington, north London, leading to homes being evacuated and five people being rescued.

Earlier this year, 50 homes in the same area of London had to be evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area.

A man was severely injured and confined to a wheelchair for three months after a manhole cover exploded next to him in Harrow, north-west London, in August 2011.

It is believed the explosions can be caused by heavy rainfall, which causes water to come into contact with electrical wires.
