MH370 investigators have revealed the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight may have been in the wrong area up until now.

In a flight path analysis released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday, it suggests that experts may have finally uncovered the Boeing 777's resting place.

The latest report details that the plane could have ran out of fuel then spiralled into the southern part of the Indian Ocean in March.

Since then, no traces of the plane nor its 239 passengers and crew on board have been found.

Investigators reveal in a new report that missing Malaysia Airline flight MH370 could have ran out of fuel and spiralled into the southern part of the Indian Ocean

The flight, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, has been missing since March 8 after veering dramatically off course.

The Malaysia-contracted GO Phoenix vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel on Monday about 1,100 miles off the Western Australia coast, which is where experts believed the plane crashed.

Later in the month, two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro will join the GO Phoenix as part of an operation that could last more than a year. 

But the latest Australian Transport Safety Bureau's detailed analysis has released information which may relate to where MH370 could have been descending at that time of disappearance. 

'The simulator activities involved fuel exhaustion of the right engine followed by flameout of the left engine with no control inputs,' it said.

'This scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiralling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flame-out.'

This is in proximity to the seventh arc, believed to be in the southern of the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft ran out of the fuel and crashed into the ocean.

Yet this comes as investigators admitted 'changes to the prioritisation and location of search activity' and further stated they will be refocusing on the refined analysis of flight and satellite data.

'The latest analyses indicates that the underwater search should be prioritised further south within the wide search area for the next phase of the search,' the report states.

However there are implications that there may also be changes to the new search area.

'Although of reasonably high confidence, and relatively large, this area does not contain all the possible derived paths,' the report states.

'The ongoing refinement may result in changes to search asset deployment.'

Despite an extensive search for the missing plane, no traces of it has been found since March 8. 

All 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were Malaysian nationals.

Of the 227 passengers, there were six Australians on board.

Australia has been leading the search for MH370 at the request of the Malaysian Government.
