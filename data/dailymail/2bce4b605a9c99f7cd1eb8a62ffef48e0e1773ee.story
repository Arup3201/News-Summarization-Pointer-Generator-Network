Afforded his first Champions League start of the season, Arsenal outcast Lukas Podolski took just three minutes to serve his case for more regular inclusion.

In fact, so far has Podolski fallen in the pecking order at the Emirates, the Germany star has collected a World Cup winner’s medal in the time since he last took part in a Premier League match from the outset.

But in Turkey on Tuesday night he reminded manager Arsene Wenger of his merit, arrowing home a ferocious drive with his first opportunity to put Arsenal on their way to a 4-1 victory over Galatasaray – the strike clocked nearly 80mph.

Podolski only offered a muted celebration after his first goal having made a rare start for Arsenal

His celebration, rather muted and moody, said much of his state of mind right now – this is what I can do, boss, any chance?

It was his aggression which then paved the way for Arsenal’s second goal and, just for good measure, he crowned the win in the final minute, bookending a fine performance with two goals.

That effort, though, left an impression, bursting from deep, swapping passes with a team-mate before coolly slotting into the bottom corner. This time, it evoked a smile.

The goal was about skill, about desire, about proving a point given the platform to do so.

Just last month, a frustrated Podolski groaned: ‘I have to speak to [manager Arsene] Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me because I have to play, so we will see what happens.

‘I am happy at Arsenal and happy in London but the only thing is I don’t play. I don’t get the chance to play. I play always 10 to 15 minutes. I cannot be happy with this.’

All the while, Arsenal have struggled and Wenger’s position remains under intense scrutiny.

Summer signing Alexis Sanchez has carried the Gunners for much of the campaign, without his 14 goals Wenger could well have been chased out before now.

Sanchez is finding the back of the net every 133 minutes – there is only one player on the books with a better ratio this term, and that man is Podolski.

In the 300 minutes made up largely of second-half cameos and, of course, his 90 in Istanbul, the 29-year-old has scored three times.

Indeed, from a total of 55 starts for the club, he has plundered 31 goals. That return makes for better reading than any of his offensive colleagues in north London.

Yet still, Wenger appears not to trust a player who has won 121 caps for the world champions.

The French boss maintains that the former Bayern Munich forward is not for sale in January and, after his exploits in midweek, admitted he was playing at a ‘strong level’.

Strong enough for a start? With Wenger in such a weak position right now, perhaps it is time to turn to Podolski.
