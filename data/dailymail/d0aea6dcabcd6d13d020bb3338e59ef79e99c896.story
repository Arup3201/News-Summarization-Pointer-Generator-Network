Stargazers in the northern hemisphere have finally had their first chance to view the first of two comets set to blaze through our skies in 2013.

Comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS, already visible for weeks from the Southern Hemisphere, appeared to observers above the equator for the first time this week.

Incredible pictures showed the comet blazing a trial above Southern California and Las Vegas last night, as it continued its long trek north as seen from Earth.

The first good viewing night for northerners was last night, when PanSTARRS appeared next to the crescent moon at dusk in the south-western sky.

Prior to that, glare from the Sun had obscured the comet.

PanSTARRS is on a 106,000-year orbit with a high inclination of 84.2 degrees with respect to the ecliptic, Universe Today reports.

That means it is moving more or less parallel to the '0 Hour' line in Right Ascension - the same spot that will be occupied by the Sun at next week's Vernal Equinox - and is gaining elevation only slowly as nights pass.

At the moment PanSTARRS is only visible in the U.S. and Europe using binoculars or a telescope, but astronomers expect the first naked-eye sightings in the next few evenings.

California astronomer Dr Tony Phillips said the comet's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it.

‘Wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight,’ Dr Phillips advised.

PanSTARRS' name is an acronym for the Hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System.

The volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way. - and in recent months there have been several.

Like other comets of its type, PanSTARRS is thought to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two light years from the Sun.

PanSTARRS travelled in towards the inner Solar system for millions of years, dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and ices.

When comets approach the Sun, these 
ices heat up, eventually turning to gases that jet out into space 
together with dusty material to form a head or coma around the cometary 
nucleus.

A comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on Mars, astronomers say.

According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet.

But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course.

Respected astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with Mars would cause a one billion megaton explosion.

That, he says, is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on Earth.

Particles from the Sun (the so-called solar wind) blow the gases back in a straight tail, whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles to create a curved tail.

To find it in UK skies, stargazers will need a clear sky, ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon, according to the Royal Astronomical Society.

'After sunset the comet will be low down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent Moon,' an RAS spokesman said.

'Using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon.

'As the days pass, the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more.

'At the same time however, PANSTARRS will be higher up, will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky.

'After its brief period of visibility, the comet will travel back out towards the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large telescopes.'

PanSTARRS is only the first comet expected to light up our skies in the next year and a half. Comet ISON may come close to outshining the moon in November.

It was discovered last September by Russian astronomers and got its acronym name from the International Scientific Optical Network.

Scientists have also identified a comet that is hurtling into our solar system from deep in space, and which could next year hit Mars with potentially catastrophic force.

According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet.

But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course.
