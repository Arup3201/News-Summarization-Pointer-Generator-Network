Missing: Rebecca Weiss, who co-owned two businesses with her husband, is said to have vanished while diving

A missing businesswoman has sparked a frantic ocean search after apparently vanishing while free-diving alone at a luxury resort.

Rebecca Weiss, 50, headed out in the morning but failed to return home by the agreed time off 5pm, according to her husband Alan Weiss.

Her clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near Los Angeles, California.

Mr Weiss, who co-owns two grocery businesses with his wife, who is described as 5ft 5in tall and Asian, says he spent four hours looking for her.

He reported her missing at 11pm on Saturday and today she still remains officially missing.

The disappearance of Mrs Weiss, who was last seen leaving her condo in her car, is being investigated by the Los Angeles Sheriff Department’s Homicide Bureau.

Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold breath for up to three minutes.

Those who practice it are at risk of blacking out from running out of breath and the sport is extremely dangerous without supervision.

The Palos Verdes beauty spot, which is a short drive from her home in Marina Del Rey, is renowned for being very challenging, even to those with considerable expertise.

A review of the area on California Diving News warns divers about the dangers of entry and exit.

It
reads: ‘The two main entry points, Long Point and Marineland Cove 
require experience, skill and some luck entering over the slippery 
boulders and constantly changing cobble beach.

‘A favourite entry point can be washed away with the next high tide. Watch the sets of waves. Small steps are required to enter and exit the water to avoid falls.’

A Coast Guard helicopter, a response boat and a cutter were joined by a Baywatch Cabrillo crew and an LASD helicopter in an overnight search.

Four divers with Baywatch Marina Del Rey have began sub-surface searches on Sunday and carried on yesterday. They will continue again today.

According to Shareen Ghabrial, who lives above the search area, a sheriff's deputy at Vanderlip Park told neighbors that the woman was a frequent snorkeler.

'On that first night ... it was quite a site,' she told Marina Del Rey Patch.

'Our homes here were fully illuminated
by the helicopters and the frantic sounds of the workers in their boats
directly below us. It was very busy here and very intense.

'That had continued through the night with just a short break of silence in the early morning.'

Mrs Weiss and her 
husband are recorded as running several businesses, including Alan L. Weiss Inc and 
Specialty Grocery Inc.

The Terannea resort, which is perched at the edge of a cliff is, according to its website, ‘infused with the elegance of a classic Mediterranean estate, the casual energy of coastal Southern California, and countless ways to spend your days – all tied together with authentic, genuine hospitality and a deep respect for this irreplaceable oceanfront setting.’

It includes guest rooms, suites, bungalows, casitas and villas, as well as restaurant, a spa and nine-hole golf course.
