Annabelle has undertaken hundreds of miles of charity walks

She was only six years old when she saw the union flag raised at school to commemorate a former pupil who died in Afghanistan.

It was put up to celebrate the life of Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, after he was killed by a Taliban bomb while serving with the Welsh Guards in 2009.

The emotive tribute must have struck a chord with Annabelle Asher, from Oxfordshire, as she has raised more than £11,500 for charity in his memory during the past four years.

Annabelle, now 10, was so moved by Lt Col Thorneloe’s death that she began selling fresh chicken eggs to students and teachers to raise money for his regiment.

She has also raised thousands of pounds completing the sponsored 190-mile coast-to-coast walk from Cumbria to Yorkshire and became the youngest person to walk the 102-mile Cotswold Way.

Annabelle is already her planning her next charity challenge – walking the 268 mile Pennine Way.

And she is so devoted to fundraising she has even foregone Christmas presents in favour of donations to her charity pot.

The youngster’s impressive record includes also conquering Britain’s tallest mountains – Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike – by the time she was six.

Annabelle saw the flag at her home at £24,000-a-year Cothill House boys’ school near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, where her parents Fiona, 47, and Adam, 43, work and live as boarding masters.

She said: ‘At Cothill there is a board with the names of all the former pupils on it and when I was six I saw a flag draped over the name of Rupert Thorneloe.

‘Mummy explained he was killed in Afghanistan and that he had been the highest ranking officer to die there. It made me sad so I decided to raise some money for the Welsh Guards’ Afghanistan appeal.

‘We had plenty of eggs from our chickens so I thought I could sell them at school. Then I decided to take it one step further by taking on big walks for charity. As a family we love the outdoors and I had climbed the Three Peaks by the time I was six so I knew I could complete long walks.

‘The coast to coast walk and the Cotswold Way were both very hard but it was worth it to raise so much money. My friends and teachers have been really supportive and very generous too.

‘I asked them to make donations instead of buying me birthday presents, and I have asked the same of my family this Christmas.

‘It is much better that the Welsh Guards get some help than I get another teddy bear.’

Annabelle took on the Cotswold Way from Bath to Chipping Campden in 2012 which she completed in five and a half days through sleet and driving rain.

She then completed the coast to coast walk from St Bees in Cumbria to Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire earlier this year in 11 days during the summer heat wave.

On both occasions she was accompanied by her father and her trusty border collie dog Izzy. Her mother drove the support car and helped by putting up tents along the routes.

Mrs Asher, who teaches French and Latin at Cothill, said: ‘I couldn’t be more proud of what Annabelle has achieved.

‘Everything she has done she has come up with herself and it’s driven by her.

‘She is so passionate about fundraising for the Welsh Guards she has told everyone she would rather they donated money than bought her Christmas presents. There aren’t many 10-year-olds who would do that.

‘Because Adam and I are house parents at the boarding school Annabelle has grown up surrounded by boys, and she loves and thrives on it.’

Annabelle, who attends St Hugh’s School in nearby Faringdon, still sells eggs at her school and is planning on walking the Pennine Way from Edale in Derbyshire to Kirk Yetholm, Scotland, in July next year.

Lt Col Thorneloe was the highest ranking British soldier to be killed in action since 1982. He attended Cothill House from 1977 to 1982.

He became the highest-ranking British officer to die in action since the Falklands War when a bomb exploded under his armoured vehicle in 2009.
