It's hard to get President Obama's ear to listen to you, but that didn't prove difficult for a little boy at the White House on Tuesday.

The unidentified boy was at the White House on Tuesday as part of the Turnaround Arts Talent Show that First Lady Michelle Obama was hosting

As she welcomed her husband, a boy tried to get the commander-in-chief's attention by reaching up and grabbing his left ear, bringing Obama closer to him.

After listening to the boy for a few seconds, the president flashed a wide grin. 

There's no word on what the boy and the President talked about.

Before
 the ear pulling happened, Mrs. Obama made a speech about the importance
 of arts in education. She turned to her husband, who had made room in 
his day and kissed him.

President Obama took time out from his schedule to support his wife. Turnaround Arts is a program to help turn around low-performing schools and increase student achievement through arts education

THE kiss: The couple were caught on a kiss cam during an NBA game in July 2012

Earlier this year, the couple were dogged by rumors their relationship was on the rocks.

Some of the nastier murmurs of the 21-year marriage said the two have been racked by screaming rows, allegations of infidelity and a string of jealous fights.

The White House has refused to comment on the reports.

According to a report in the National Enquirer – which plastered ‘Obama Divorce Bombshell!’ across its front page in February  – the pair have been at loggerheads since last summer and are now sleeping in separate bedrooms.

The ‘final straw’, apparently, was Michelle’s outrage when her husband publicly humiliated her by openly flirting and posing for his now infamous ‘selfie’ photograph with Denmark’s glamorous blonde Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service.

According to published reports, Mrs Obama is only standing by her 52-year-old husband until his presidency ends. 

Icy: The couple's relationship was center court in December during their Christmas vacation in Hawaii. The body language during a
 basketball game in Honolulu was described as 'frosty'

Oops, missed: The two had an awkward 
embrace after a university address about plans to help disadvantaged 
students attend college in Janaury. A witness said: 'Barack tried to kiss Michelle 
on the lips as she came onstage but she turned her cheek.'

Michelle grits her teeth and rolls her eyes skyward as Obama snaps his 
now infamous 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt 
and David Cameron at Nelson Mandela's memorial

But on Tuesday it was all about arts in education.

Michelle Obama said that it isn't something to be introduced after student test scores go up, but is a critical element of achieving those higher test scores in the first place.

The lawyer-turned-first lady argued her case while opening the first White House student talent show, featuring spirited song and dance routines by students whose schools had performed so poorly they were chosen for a new federal arts education program.

By the end of the hourlong, toe-tapping, hand-clapping show in the East Room, which was bathed in a soothing orange light, and Mrs. Obama had joined all the students on the makeshift stage to dance during their closing number, which shared its name with her husband's 'Yes We Can' presidential campaign slogan.

President Barack Obama even broke away from his work elsewhere in the White House to come and make his own pitch for arts education and to congratulate the elementary and middle-school-age performers.

The talent show was a vehicle to showcase the Turnaround Arts program.

It was created as an experiment in 2012 by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in collaboration with the White House and the Education Department to test whether arts education can help improve student outcomes and create more positive learning environments. Major artists adopted each school.

Encouraged by the results so far, including higher reading and math scores and fewer disciplinary problems, Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year from the original eight schools to 35 schools in 10 states — Iowa, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Louisiana, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, California, Illinois, Minnesota — and the District of Columbia.

Two of the original eight schools have improved so much that they are no longer in 'turnaround' status, she said.

Those schools are Findley Elementary School in Des Moines, Iowa, and Orchard Gardens in Boston.

The arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class because they are looking forward to the next musical they're performing in or the instrument they can't wait to play.

'But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all,' Mrs. Obama said.

'The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on after we've achieved other priorities, like raising test scores and getting kids into college. It's actually critical for achieving those priorities in the first place.'
