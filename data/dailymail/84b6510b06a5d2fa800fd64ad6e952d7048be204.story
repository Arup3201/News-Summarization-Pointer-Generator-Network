The long hours spent cooped up in hotels has long been a chief moan for players on England duty, and it looks like Joe Hart has been sent nuts.

The Three Lions goalkeeper was spotted hanging around on his hotel balcony in Basle on Sunday night, looking a little bored.

But the Manchester City keeper soon found a way to amuse himself - flicking what looked like nuts at unknown targets below.

England take on Switzerland at St-Jakob Park on Monday night in their opening qualifying match for Euro 2016.

And while the clock ticked down towards the big day, Hart, 27, was pictured tucking into a few of the snacks on his balcony.

Soon, however, the cheeky keeper moved on to flicking the food in several different directions.

His face was a picture of concentration and the technique of his distribution looked spot on. 

Let's hope that is also the case against Switzerland in what could be the toughest task Roy Hodgson's men face on the road to Euro 2016.
