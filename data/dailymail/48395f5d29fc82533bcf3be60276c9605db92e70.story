The 18-year-old girl was waiting by the roadside in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when she was viciously attacked just before 11pm last Friday.

CCTV footage of the shocking bus stop attack in Leeds, West Yorkshire (pictured), shows the 18-year-old victim being hit over the head with a blunt object numerous times before being seriously sexually assaulted

Police said they are looking for an Asian man in his early 20s, of slim build, with receding dark coloured hair, in connection the attack which occurred as the 18-year-old victim waited at the bus stop on Friday evening

Officers from West Yorkshire Police said the footage is not being released to the public at this stage but said it may hold vital clues to help identify the suspect.

Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The offence has been captured on CCTV and while the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect as it stands, it clearly shows the very disturbing circumstances of the offence.

'The victim is seen being carried away a short distance while struggling against her attacker who takes her into a nearby garden.

'He can then be seen striking her over the head numerous times with a blunt object that we believe to have been a large stone.'

The young Asian victim was grabbed from behind by the man, who is in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds at about 10.52pm on Friday.

She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with serious head and hip injuries and she remains in hospital today.

Police found her lying on the ground in a pool of blood with head wounds before later discovering she had been subjected to a serious sexual assault.

Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

Mr Wallen said: 'The victim is still recovering in hospital after being subjected to a very violent physical assault and a repeated serious sexual assault.

'Her injuries are serious but thankfully not life-threatening and she has been left very badly traumatised by the ordeal.

'Specialist officers are working with her to support her and to elicit as much information as we can to assist with the investigation.

'At this point we believe the suspect is of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin.

'It is possible that the suspect could be somebody who is from abroad and has recently come to the country.

'They may be staying locally in a bedsit or hostel and I would like to hear from anyone who runs such premises who thinks they know who it might be.'

Officers have combed the scene for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect. Police said CCTV footage of the attempted murder incident shows the 'very disturbing circumstances of the offence'

Police have described the suspect as Asian or Middle Eastern, aged in his early twenties, slim, with receding black hair. He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue coat at the time of the attack.

Mr Wallen said that shortly after the 'unprecedented' incident a man was seen running along nearby Beeston Road.

He added: 'We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have seen the suspect in the area at any time that evening.

'If you were the person seen running we would like you to come forward.

'We would also like to trace a potential witness - a woman who was seen standing at the bus stop before the incident before getting on either a number 1 or number 74 bus.

'This was a shocking incident which is unprecedented both for this area and for Leeds as whole. However I appreciate it will understandably cause people in the community a good deal of concern.

'Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out increased patrols in the area and those will be continuing as part of our efforts to provide visible reassurance to the community.

The teenager was raped as she waited at a bus stop (pictured) near Leeds City centre late on Friday night. She remains in hospital three days on from the attack with serious but non life-threatening head injuries

'They will also be working closely with key contacts in the community to keep people informed as the investigation progresses.'

Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton said the crime had 'shocked the community' and said it was being treated as attempted murder because the victim had been 'left for dead'.

The officer also confirmed the attack was not racially motivated and encouraged people to come forward with information about the attack, saying this is 'no time for family loyalty.'

She added: 'I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene.

'It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing.'

Anyone with any information are asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
