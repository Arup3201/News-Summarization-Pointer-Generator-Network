In addition to shivering and drowsiness, symptoms of severe hypothermia include confusion and poor decision-making, which leads some sufferers of the condition to remove their clothing.

According to Springer's Facebook he left behind an infant daughter. 

Springer's other immediate family members have not spoken out nor have they been identified at this time.

'The preliminary autopsy results do not show any signs of foul pay,' the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement to the Star Tribune.

'At this time it appears as if the victim died as a result of hypothermia,' continued the statement.

Around 4:10 officials were called to a report seeing a naked and unconscious man on the golf course.

Deputy Sheriff Brian Lundeen told the Star Tribune that Springer recently moved to Fertile, Minnesota and lived less than two blocks away from the eastern edge of the golf course.
