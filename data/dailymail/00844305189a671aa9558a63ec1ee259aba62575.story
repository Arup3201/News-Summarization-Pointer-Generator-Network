Two neighbouring families were caught on video during a half-hour street brawl with paint tins, a machete, sticks and a chair, a court heard.

The fight was triggered when Gary Shackleton, 26, and Andrew Dixon, 44, clashed outside their homes in Newcastle and then went indoors to gather makeshift weapons and family members.

Shackleton came out with a heavy tin of paint, which he smashed into Dixon's head, before his  brother Paul followed him out carrying a stick, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

CCTV footage shows Dixon carrying what appears to be a machete and then attacking Gary with a stick, kicking him in the head and hitting him with a broken chair.

Both Shackleton brothers were injured and Gary was left needing 25 stitches to his head.

Gary was jailed for four years, his brother was given a nine-month suspended sentence and Dixon was jailed for six months.

The row began when Shackleton fell from his bike and accused Dixon of going through his pockets.

Dixon is seen pushing a bike away from Shackleton, who then punches him, at which point they both enter their houses.

Jailing Shackleton for affray and an unrelated burglary, Judge John Evans said: 'It was a disgraceful incident and you behaved in a way which resulted in a serious outburst of violence.

'You dealt the first blow to Dixon and thereafter the violence escalated, and you ended up with serious injuries to your head.

'You can’t expect sympathy for that given your behaviour.'

Brutal: Dixon, carrying what appears to be a machete, attacked Gary with a stick, kicking him in the head and hitting him with a broken chair

The fight took place on their street on February 2 this year.

Barry Robson, defending Gary, said: 'He fell off his bike as he had been taking valium, and he doesn’t know if he passed out, but he accused the victims of trying to take money from his pockets.

'If anyone came out of this with a good hiding it was him. He had to be stitched up.'

Paul Shackleton, from Denton Burn, Newcastle, has 53 previous convictions. He admitted affray on the basis he was less involved.

Glenn Gatland, defending Paul, said: 'He didn’t actually hit anyone, he just chased someone with a stick. He suffered injuries.'

He was given nine months in prison, suspended for 12 months, with a three-month curfew.

Dixon, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to affray and was jailed for six months.

Mark Saunders, defending Dixon, said: 'This was not an incident brought by the Dixons to the door of the Shackletons, it may have been the other way round.

'There had been earlier difficulties but this was the crescendo.'

Nasty: Gary, who has convictions for 59 previous offences, needed 25 stitches in his head

Gary, from Benwell, has convictions for 59 previous offences and pleaded guilty to affray and burglary.

In May, he terrified a couple when they caught him burgling their home, the court heard.

The 53-year-old woman got up to go to the toilet during the night and heard a noise downstairs.

When she went to look, the kitchen door into the garage was open, as was the door from the garage into the garden, and she saw Shackleton running into the garden carrying an electric saw.

The woman’s 54-year-old husband came down and was confronted by Shackleton at his front door.

The thug pushed the man back into his house and his wife slammed the door and rang the police.

In 2007, the Shackletons became the first family to be evicted from a private property after drunkenness, vandalism sprees and thefts.

Dawn Shackleton, together with sons Gary, Paul and Mark and partner Colin Alderson, made life miserable for people living in Newcastle’s West End.

When they were finally kicked out of their home, Mrs Shackleton claimed her family were the real victims.

She complained about not being able to run her house on state handouts, but boasted of her 52inch widescreen plasma TV and family jaunts to Corfu and Benidorm - apparently paid for with ‘savings’.

The 47-year-old mother was later exposed as a benefits cheat.

The Department for Work and Pensions launched an investigation into her finances after the family’s eviction was highlighted.

Investigations revealed she had been pretending to be her sister Julie Menzah, who lives thousands of miles away in Africa, for 12 years.

She used the false identity to claim income support, jobseeker’s allowance, child benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit, on top of the benefits she was entitled to already.

In the run-up to their eviction, family members were arrested 40 times in six months.
