A Syrian rebel filmed cutting out and eating the lung of a dead government soldier has said he has no regrets.

The man in the brutal video has identified himself as Khalid al Hamad and insists that the brutality of the regime had driven him to the extreme act.

'Our slogan is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' he told TIME magazine.

The unverified clip, posted by a pro-government campaign group shows Khalid al Hamad-  who also goes by the name Abu Sakkar - the well-known founder of Homs' Farouq Brigade - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against President Bashar al Assad.

Horrific: The amateur video posted on the Internet on Sunday shows Khalid al Hamad, a founder of the rebel Farouq Brigade who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from Homs, cutting into the torso of a dead soldier

Remorseless: After removing what appears to be the dead man's heart, Al Hamad then reaches into the chest cavity

Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.'

He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite.

Al Hamad who is Sunni and has a sectarian hatred for Alawite Muslims insists the video captures the first time he had ever attempted to eat an enemy’s liver.

Gory: Brandishing the organs for the camera to see, Al Hamad  continues his rant against Assad's government 

'We opened his cell phone and I found
 a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was 
humiliating them, and sticking a stick here and there,' Al Hamad told TIME magazine via Skype phone call yesterday.

He said he has another gruesome video of him killing a government soldier from the Alawite faith and sawing him into pieces.

The Supreme Military Council has 
issued a poster - circulated on Facebook - calling for al Hamad’s arrest, 
saying it wants him 'dead or alive.'

The video, posted on YouTube by and billed as proof of a war crime, is the latest 
installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes 
of this bloody conflict.

Last month, a photograph was released
 by a pro-Assad group based in Lebanon that appeared to show a young 
rebel fighter barbecuing the severed head of a government soldier.

Experts say such images demonstrate 
that the battlefield has spread from rubble-strewn streets and 
war-churned fields to the internet as both sides vie to control their 
public image and discredit that of their opposition.

Meanwhile, human rights groups say it 
is emblematic of a civil war that has rapidly descended into sectarian 
hatred and revenge killings.

In the most recent video, Al Hamad 
tells the camera: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your 
livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog,'

His rant is greeted by offscreen cheers of his comrades shouting 'Allahu akbar (God is great)'.

Earlier this year another sickening video showed a rebel leader eating the heart of a captured soldier

Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch 
said that he had seen an original, unedited copy of the video and that 
Al Hamad's identity had been confirmed by rebel sources in Homs and by
 images of him in other videos wearing the same black jacket as in the 
latest clip and with the same rings on his fingers.

'The
 mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more 
serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and 
violence,' said Bouckaert.

He said that in the unedited version 
of the film, Al Hamad instructs his men to 'slaughter the Alawites and
 take their hearts out to eat them', before biting into the heart.

Al Hamad  has been seen in previous videos firing rockets at Lebanese 
Shi'ite villages on the border and posing with the body of a soldier 
purportedly from the Lebanese Shi'ite militant Hezbollah group, which is
 helping Assad's forces.

The Syrian conflict started with 
peaceful protests in March 2011, but when these were suppressed it 
gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which, 
according to one opposition monitoring group, has cost more than 80,000 
lives.

Majority Sunni 
Muslims lead the revolt, while Assad - whose family have ruled for over 
four decades - gets his core support from his own Alawite sect, an 
offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.
