Jurisprudence: Huang Qifan, Mayor of Chongqing, recommended Chinese judges take tips from Hollywood films

A Chinese mayor has told judges to watch Hollywood films to help them deal with moral dilemmas in important cases.

Huang Qifan, the Mayor of Chongqing, said tense courtroom dramas and heart-wrenching action movies could teach them valuable lessons about dispensing justice.

In the unorthodox contribution during a panel discussion at the National People's Congress in Beijing, Mr Huang argued that in a Hollywood narrative, good will overcome evil, juries can be swayed by a compelling speech and a hero is often torn between emotions and a rational choice.

But all such genres can provide helpful guidance for judges, he said.

Although Mr Huang did not name any films specifically, some were recognisable from the plot.

They included the 1996 action film The Rock in which a renegade general, played by Ed Harris, takes over Alcatraz prison and threatens to use chemical weapons against U.S. citizens until Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage save the day.

Although a smash hit at the box office, the film, produced by the same team behind Top Gun, was not considered a masterpiece by critics.

Movie magic: Mr Huang appeared to make reference to the 1996 film The Rock starring Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage

Film lessons: Perhaps Mr Huang was referencing the 1992 classic A Few Good Men when he said U.S. lawyers can 'seduce the jury's emotions'

But Mr Huang evidently felt some wise lessons could be drawn in between the car chases, explosions and combat scenes.

Certainly Connery's character, who has been held in a U.S. prison without trial for 30 years because he was accused of stealing state secrets, could be recognised in China's often opaque justice system.

Mr Huang drew particular attention to the fact he is convinced to help the authorities thwart the terrorist plot in exchange for his freedom.

He also made reference to American lawyers and their knack for turning a seemingly impossible-to-win case around.

'It's important to see how U.S. lawyers seduce the jury's emotions,' he said.

There was one caveat however to the mayor's endorsement of judges taking up film studies - they should only watch movies on their days off.
