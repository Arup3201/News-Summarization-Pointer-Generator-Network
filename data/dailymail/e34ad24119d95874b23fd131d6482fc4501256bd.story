They're the fairy tale characters whose stories send children around the world to sleep.

But a Mexican artist has turned pictures of classic Disney characters into the stuff of nightmares by adding movie villains.

Drawings include a terrified Peter Pan confronting Michael Myers, from the Halloween films. Snow White being attacked by Jason, from the Friday the 13th film series and Rapunzel from Tangled being manhandled by Batman baddie The Joker.

One particularly chilling scene depicts Sleeping Beauty being watched over by Freddie Kruger, from Nightmare on Elm Street. Another shows the limp body of the Little Mermaid being carried by Gill-man from the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

The artist, José Rodolfo Loaiza Ontiveros, said: 'I find it interesting to present the viewer with opposite characters and suggest a different ending to 'happily ever after.

'My work is an ongoing tribute to pop culture and enables me to present a speech about our social vulnerability, prejudice and the double standards of our environment.

'But overall my work is a kind of thermometer to measure our level of tolerance about certain taboo subjects.'

Snow White looks far less of a fairy tale character with knife in hand and Hannibal Lecter on her dress

Not surprisingly, not everyone is a fan of the 31-year-old's work.   

He said: 'People can react aggressively towards my work and immediately disqualify me.

'However, some people find them funny and witty, then congratulate me and write optimistic comments.

'Both reactions are important for me and I'm thankful because all of this helps me grow as an artist.'

Mr Rodolfo uses oil and acrylic paint to create each picture which can take anything from a couple of days to a couple of weeks to complete.
