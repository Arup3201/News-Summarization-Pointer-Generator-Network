There was a moment during Wayne Rooney’s return to where it all started, when 99 England caps and all those honours were the furthest thing from his mind.

Standing in the foyer of Our Lady and St Swithin’s Catholic Primary School, peering into the main hall, the sight of 99 excited pupils — who had gathered to mark the latest milestone in his glittering career — took him back to his childhood.

It was in this school, in the working-class Croxteth area of Liverpool, that Rooney’s dreams of becoming a top footballer took flight. This is where he began kicking a ball in earnest, scampering around on a little yard he remembers ‘felt as big as three pitches’.

Rooney will become England’s ninth centurion when he leads the team out against Slovenia at Wembley this Saturday.

In recognition of the achievement, he took part in a photoshoot for Sportsmail that had echoes of the iconic images of former England captains Bobby Moore (1973) and Steven Gerrard (2012).

As he walked into the hall, Manchester United’s captain was given a deafening ovation.

The children, who had behaved impeccably as they waited patiently for him to arrive, sang his name and cheered as he took his place among them.

If Rooney felt any nerves, they were quickly dispelled as he was bombarded with questions and affectionate slaps on the back. He may play his club football down the M62 but he remains very much a local hero. This, clearly, was a humbling experience.

Each of the 99 children had their shirt signed by the England and Manchester United forward as they shared the special occasion

‘It was very special to come back to the school I went to as a young boy,’ said Rooney. ‘I saw a few former teachers who were here when I was and it was great to see the kids so delighted. This is where I started kicking a ball around.

‘All the young kids here have dreams. All the young lads grow up wanting to be footballers. They love the sport.

‘I was the same when I was here. I just wanted to be a professional footballer and I have managed to do that. So to captain my country and be closing in on 100 caps is special.

‘It’s great for the school as well. I’m really proud of where I come from and it’s great that I can come back to the area. They all know I play for Manchester United and hopefully they are proud of what I have done in my career. Hopefully it inspires them.

‘For the kids to see someone who has been to this school and gone on to achieve what I have done, shows they can achieve their dreams. I know what it is like. Franny Jeffers went to my senior school (De La Salle) and he inspired me. It would be great to think that it would be the same for these.’

There is no doubt he is a beacon at St Swithin’s. In the foyer, an England shirt and ball signed by Rooney provide a daily reminder to pupils of what can be achieved with talent, hard work and dedication.

‘Wayne gives the children self-belief and he has got every value that we value,’ said headteacher Sandra Hamilton.

‘He is mature and resilient; a leader. He is world-class. We look at him as a wonderful family man and are extremely proud of everything that he does.’

Rooney has enjoyed many memorable days but this, clearly, struck a chord.

It was also special for the 99 children, each of whom left with the shirt they wore for the photograph sporting his autograph.

As for Rooney, he didn’t leave empty-handed, either. Awaiting him as he walked out of the door were two-more caps — these ones emblazoned with the St Swithin’s crest.

‘I remember being up on that stage in the school choir,’ reflected Rooney. ‘I had a solo part in a play one year. I didn’t fancy it (singing) again! The memories do come back, obviously. There have been one or two changes but it is still as much as I remember it. It’s a very welcoming school.

‘When you are here as a kid, you think it is absolutely massive, the building and everything. I used to think the schoolyard was as big as three football pitches. So it was special to come back, of course it was. It was a great day.’

The 99 children listened as Rooney returned to where his education - and footballing journey - all began 

Many of the children in the photograph will hope they can emulate Rooney and make a career from football
