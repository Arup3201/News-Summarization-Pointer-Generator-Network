Over-joyed: Colour Sergeant Thomas O'Donnell is preparing to return to Afghanistan two years after his leg was shattered by a Taliban bullet

Lying in agony in a hospital bed, his left knee shattered by a Taliban bullet, Colour Sergeant Thomas O’Donnell was confronted by medics with the grim news he had been dreading.

His war injuries were so severe he would probably need his leg amputating. Even if he kept the smashed limb, they continued, it was so badly damaged his days as a soldier were over.

But after an incredible battle to recuperate, the inspirational 37-year-old has defied the doctors.

Next
month, he will complete his miraculous journey by returning to the 
Afghan frontline with his comrades in the 1st Battalion Scots Guards (1 
SG) – just two years after being shot.

His
determination to recover was spurred on by the desire to walk daughter 
Siobhan, 22, down the aisle, unaided by crutches or a wheelchair.

Last
October, she married Lance Corporal Neil Clark – a fellow Scots Guard 
who is also deploying to Helmand – after entering the church on the arm 
of her father.

Yesterday, 
C/Sgt O’Donnell, from Pollok, Glasgow, told of his pride at being able 
to achieve his two ambitions since he was shot.

He
said: ‘I have fulfilled the dreams that kept me focused while I was 
recovering: walking my daughter down the aisle to get married and 
deploying with the battalion again.’

The
soldier, who has served with Catterick-based 1 SG for 16 years, 
described his remarkable story as he completed pre-deployment training 
on Salisbury Plain. His unit is part of 4 Mechanised Brigade – nicknamed
the Black Rats – which is going to Afghanistan for a six-month tour of 
duty.

C/Sgt O’Donnell, a father of two, was shot during a massive push to seize the rebel-held town of Saidabad – a ‘hornet’s nest’ in Nad-e Ali, southern Helmand Province, in February 2010.

During a mission to flush out a Taliban sniper, he confronted two insurgents laying an improvised explosive device (IED) designed to murder and maim British troops.

The enemy fighters were burying the homemade bomb just 150metres from a compound being used by his platoon.

C/Sgt O’Donnell said: ‘It was a pretty busy day. I could not believe how close they were. It was cheeky to say the least.’

As he pointed the men’s position out to his commander, ‘all hell broke loose’ with bullets spraying the British troops. Before he had dashed the 10metres to the compound, an AK47 round hit his lower left thigh.

'Horrendous pain': C/Sgt O'Donnell being stretchered away after during a mission in Helmand Province. Medics said he would probably lose his leg

The bullet shattered the bone and split his kneecap in two. He said: ‘Some people who lose limbs in IED strike just sit there chilling out while first aid is carried out but I was crying like a baby.

‘It was one of the most horrendous pains I've ever felt. But that only lasted about five minutes - the medics we had on hand were very, very good.

‘They administered morphine... and calmed me down.’

He was evacuated from the battlefield by a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter and was on an operating table at Camp Bastion within 30 minutes.

There he was told that he might lose his left leg.

When he was flown back to Britain, medical staff at Selly Oak in Birmingham told C/Sgt O'Donnell they could save his leg, but he was given the devastating news that he would never ‘soldier’ again.

He said: ‘I was gutted. I thought about going onto civvy street with no qualifications and it was like having the carpet pulled from underneath me.’

Incredible comeback: As this X-Ray shows, the 37-year-old had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together after undergoing 13 operations

But a visit from his daughter in hospital made him determined to recover.

‘She told me she was getting married. And that's when I said to myself, I will walk her down the aisle.’

Then while watching his colleagues from the Scots Guards during their homecoming parade he asked himself: ‘Why not get back with the boys?’

The road to recovery continued at Headley Court. He undertook a gruelling regime of physiotherapy and fitness work. ‘My main priority was walking Siobhan down the aisle without a walking stick. I achieved it – it was the proudest day of my life.’

He now jokingly describes the medical staff there as ‘physio-terrorists’ - taking no prisoners, but he is full of praise for their efforts to help him walk again.

C/Sgt O’Donnell had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together. He has also had 13 operations. His left leg is 2cm shorter than his right, but he is close to regaining full mobility.

He said: ‘I cannot fault the medical team. Ten years ago I probably would have lost my leg but thanks to the Scots Guards team medics on the ground and the doctors I am now able to deploy again.’

He will be stationed at Forward Operating Base Oullette in the Gereshk Valley, carrying out the vital task of co-ordinating supply helicopter flights for the troops there.

C/Sgt O’Donnell said he was ‘slightly nervous’ about returning to Afghanistan in case he is shot again. ‘I couldn’t cope with another two years being like a baby learning to walk,’ he said.

But his injuries have not deterred his 18-year-old son Thomas Jnr from joining the Army. He is following his father into the Scots Guards and could be sent to the frontline early next year.
