The way Muslim women should dress in public has been a strongly debated topic in recent months.

But a new study has now revealed what the citizens of different Muslim countries believe is appropriate female dress - and how widely views differ between them.

The survey was conducted across seven countries - Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - which all have a majority Muslim population.

And the research from the University of 
Michigan’s Institute for Social Research found that most residents in 
these countries prefer women to cover their hair with a traditional 
hijab, al-Amira or head scarf rather than cover their entire face with a full 
burqa or niqab. 

Survey: Chart shows how people from seven different countries with a majority-Muslim population believe women should dress

Researchers asked respondents to pick their favoured style of female Muslim dress from a chart, assembled by the Pew Research Center, showing a range of clothing from the full burka (see image one on the chart above) and niqab (see image two) to types of hijabs (image four and five) to no head covering at all (image six).

The majority of those questioned - 57 per cent in Tunisia, 52 per cent in Egypt, 46 per cent in Turkey and 44 per cent in Iraq - believed the white hiqab or basic al-Amira (shown in image four) is the most appropriate dress for a Muslim woman.

But the more conservative black hijab or chador (shown in image three) was the second favourite choice of citizens in Iraq and Egypt.

And a 63 per cent-majority of those polled in Saudi Arabia chose the second most conservative form of dress, a niqab, which is depicted in image two.

Overall, the majority of those questioned across the seven Muslim-majority countries prefer women to cover their hair with a hijab, pictured left, rather than cover their face with a full burka, pictured right

Talking point: What Muslim women should or shouldn't wear has been the subject of heated debate the wold over, including Luton in the UK, pictured

It was a similar response in Pakistan where more than 60 per cent overall opted for choices two or three while 25 per cent went for the hijab worn in image four.

Only in Lebanon and Turkey did a substantial proportion believe it is appropriate for women not to cover their head at all in public.

Roughly a third of Turks, nearly half of those surveyed in Lebanon and 15 per cent of Tunisians agreed it is acceptable for a woman to appear in public without a head covering.

Although the fact that 27 per cent of those quizzed in Lebanon were Christian may have an impact upon the results. Also the results are not broken down by gender.
