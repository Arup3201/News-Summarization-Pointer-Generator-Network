The families of tragic Sydney siege victims Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson have vowed to visit the Lindt café when it reopens.

Tori Johnson's partner Thomas Zinn has shared a heartfelt message, explaining: 'we would like for people to return to Martin Place and smile again.'

He made the simple statement on Thursday when it was announced the Lindt Cafe would reopen by mid March, featuring a memorial to the victims of December's fatal Sydney siege.

Mr Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson were killed there along with gunman Man Horan Monis.

The Dawson family have also said they want to go to the cafe when it reopens, as it was a place Ms Dawson loved to visit almost daily.

'Although it will be difficult at first, we hope to be able in time to return to the Lindt cafe so that her children can continue to experience one of Katrina's great joys,' a statement from Paul Smith and the Dawson family, aired on the Seven Network, stated.

Mr Zinn felt the same.

'(Tori) always had so much pleasure in making other people happy or put a smile on their face,' he said in a statement read on the Seven Network.

'We would like for people to return to Martin Place and smile again.' 

Repairs are currently under way at the Martin Place cafe after it was damaged during the siege that claimed the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson in December.

Lindt officially confirmed on Thursday they would reopen the cafe.

'After the tragic events that happened at the end of last year, we feel this is the right thing to do, to move forward and to push on in a positive way,' a spokesman said.

'We have taken this decision after careful consideration of a number of factors, the most important of which was consultation with our staff, whom feel positive about this decision and believe this is the best way forward.'

The final opening date hasn't been announced but Lindt said they were working on plans for a memorial in the cafe to remember those affected. 

'We are still confirming what the memorial will look like, as these things do take a little bit of time, but we feel this is fitting and appropriate to remember their bravery,' the spokesman said.

Tori Johnson, 34, Katrina Dawson, 38, and the gunman who held them hostage for more than 16 hours were all killed.

It was revealed at a coronial inquest last month that Mr Johnson was shot in the head at point blank range by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis after being forced to kneel on the cafe floor.

Ms Dawson was killed by fragments of ricocheting bullets fired by police when they stormed the cafe soon after Mr Johnson was killed.

Some of the hostages who were held alongside Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson shared the agony and fear they felt in televised interviews on 60 Minutes and Seven News this week. 

They told of how Monis forced them to call emergency services to tell them his demands, and how the gunman became more frustrated as night fell. 

Louisa Hope, 52, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die.

'When the noise of the gun, and then Tori fell forward... He hasn't just died, his life has been taken,' she said.

Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff.

'I knew he didn't want to get out of there alive and because of that, I was very scared about how it was going to end,' she told Channel Seven.

Ms Mikhael said she was beside Ms Dawson as police charged into the cafe, shortly after Ms Johnson was killed.

'There were just so many shots. I could smell the gunpower, I could feel the heat... It was so bright, everyone was just lit up as if it was New Year's Eve,' she said.

'And then all of a sudden it stopped... and I could see police officers wearing the black uniform.

'She wasn't moving. She was just lying down with her head facing me, looking at me.'

Harriette Denny, who was 13 weeks pregnant when the siege unfolded, revealed she thought the gunman was going to shoot them in full view of the public.

'You lose hope, thinking about your family outside, thinking there's nothing you can do to get yourself out and it's very hard,' she told 60 Minutes.

John O'Brien, 82, said Monis was 'ranting and raving' about Prime Minister Tony Abbott and threatened to kill everyone in the cafe. 

'Tony Abbott wouldn't come to the phone, he said Tony Abbott will have all your blood on his hands when I kill you all, one by one,' Mr O'Brien told Channel Seven. 

The interviews, for which channels Seven and Nine reportedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, came just over a week after an inquest opened into the siege.

In their store reopening announcement, Lindt encouraged people to visit the charity page set up in Mr Johnson's honour. 

'Tori was someone who had a very positive approach to life and this page was set up in Tori's memory after the event to raise funds for beyondblue, a charity chosen by his family,' the spokesman said. 

'We know that all concerned, including Tori's family, are deeply grateful for the donations being made.'

A permanent tribute will be put in place at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place when it reopens to honour the memory of the victims, Tori Johnson (pictured) and Katrina Dawson
