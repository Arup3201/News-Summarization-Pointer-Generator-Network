A seashore looked more like a meadow after huge piles of seaweed was washed up onto the shoreline.

A beach in Rizhao, Shandong, has been given a whole new look after the lush green mess lay tangled on the beach.

The pile of seaweed - also known as sea lettuce - arrived on Saturday, and shows no sign of disappearing as the sea waves are constantly pushing them on to the land.

But it's not only brought a flash of green to the city - it can also be tucked into.

Enteromorpha prolifera is edible, and rich in magnesium and many other nutrients, the Shanghaiist reported.

But clean up teams will have to work quickly to clean up the green stuff, before it decomposes and begins to rot.

Tidal currents are predicted to move the seaweed to Qingdao next.

In 2008, when Qingdao was inundated with the sea lettuce, the government had to step in, the Atlantic reported.

Because it was the site of many sailing events for the Summer Olympics, soldiers wereÂ  sent to speedily remove the mess right away.

Seaweed has been praised as being a vitamin-rich food source that can help improve skin and lower blood pressure.

This particular type of seaweed can grow up to 50cm in length, typically growing near the shore, on rocks or other algae, on open coasts or in estuaries and harbours.

The Shangdong province lays in the east of China, and borders on the Bohai and Huanghai seas in the east.

It overlooks the Korean Peninsula and the Japan Archipelago and is frequently affected by marine monsoons.
