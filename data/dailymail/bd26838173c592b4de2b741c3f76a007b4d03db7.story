Uphill struggle: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will attempt to turn the tide on limited use of GM food in Europe with a high-profile speech

Genetically modified crops should be sold in Europe, despite consumers' concerns about 'Frankenstein foods’, the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will say.

Mr Paterson, who has previously spoken out about the benefits of GM technology, has decided to make a high-profile speech in the hope of turning the tide on the issue.

It is understood he has the firm backing of Chancellor George Osborne, who believes GM food could provide opportunities for British farmers.

Brussels has so far only approved two GM crops for human consumption, although they are widely used in the US and China, and can be fed to animals in the EU. Supporters say Europe will suffer food shortages and be more reliant on imports if it continues to reject GM products.

But the Mail has highlighted concerns over 'Frankenstein foods' for years, amid fears that tampering with the genes in crops could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health.

The Environment Secretary has dismissed these concerns as 'complete nonsense’. He believes Britain should be open to using the GM science to increase crop yields and prevent disease.

Last year he called critics of the technology 'humbugs' and said the case for GM  food needed to be made 'emphatically' in Britain.

But Mr Paterson, who has been criticised for his handling of the horsemeat scandal, faces an uphill struggle convincing the British public of the benefits of GM food.

A survey last month by the Food Standards Agency found two out of three UK shoppers wanted products from animals fed a GM diet to be labelled.

Mr Paterson will also have to win over countries who are deeply opposed to any form of GM farming or food such as France and Germany.

His most viable option is for every nation to be allowed to choose whether to sell GM food in their shops.

In 2010, the EU Commission considered giving back control over GM crop approval to member states.

But this policy was abandoned last year after widespread opposition, as the food industry is too globalised for it to work.

An aide to Mr Paterson  said: 'He wants to have a national conversation about it, based on scientific evidence, and the Prime Minister supports that.'

Tory MP George Freeman has been advising Whitehall on the UK’s agri-tech policy. He believes the safety debate is over.

He told the Financial Times: 'Over a trillion meals containing GM food have now been eaten in what is effectively  the biggest ever global clinical trial in the history of mankind, without one adverse health report.

'The world is adopting genetic crop science. The question is whether the UK is going to benefit or not?’

The Coalition has so far allowed scientists to carry out small-scale GM cultivation trials, but its use in consumer products is effectively banned.

However, British farmers have reportedly written to supermarkets warning them that they will not be able to guarantee chickens are fed on solely non-GM feed by May.
