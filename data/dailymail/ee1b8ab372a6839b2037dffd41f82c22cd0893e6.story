The Army has introduced new shirts that can be rolled up in warm weather, but there are fears soldiers will be forced to wear much-maligned elbow pads to avoid cuts and scrapes as a result.

Personnel on duty have long complained about the current multi-terrain pattern uniforms, introduced in 2011, because they have removable foam elbow pads incorporated into the sleeve, so they cannot be rolled up in sweltering areas of operation like Afghanistan.

From September Army chiefs will now introduce new shirts that can be rolled-up to increase their comfort, but there are reports troops will have to wear elbow pads, commonly used by skateboarders and BMX riders, to avoid injuries.

One officer said the elbow pads will 'struggle for acceptance', while one infantryman called them 'pretty orthopaedic', reports The Times.

However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the new shirts are only intended for use in barracks and other non-combat or exercise roles.

He said: 'There were a lot of soldiers saying we should be able to roll up our sleeves in the hot weather. The Army has been looking at shirts we can wear in barracks for some time.

'All that is happening is the new shirt will supplement what we already have.'

A change in policy has also been made that will allow soldiers to roll up the sleeves of their current uniforms (with the foam pads removed) - subject to their officers' discretion - before the new shirts are introduced.

The spokesman added that elbow pads and knee pads are used by the infantry, while the multi-terrain pattern uniforms are used by other sections of the Army.

Since their introduction in 2011, troops have complained that the multi-terrain pattern uniform's combat fatigues are 'ridiculous' and make them look like Action Man.

Soldiers have criticised it as being ill-fitting, poorly designed, poorly made and 'too American'.

The Ministry of Defence spent Â£40million on the new outfits, claiming that they will be more comfortable to wear with body armour and provide better camouflage.
