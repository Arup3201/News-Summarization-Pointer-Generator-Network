Behind the wheel was his father, on his way to pick up his other son, only eight months old, from the babysitter.

The medical examiner has ruled the death as an accident due to blunt force trauma to the head.

The family's priest, Father Joseph Tung Dang, addressed reporters with a picture of the smiling Justin in his hands.

'We are unbelievably 
saddened and brokenhearted,' Dang  said on behalf of the family. '(Justin) was 
such a blessing with his smiling face to his family with his brief time 
here.'

The family are natives of Vietnam.

Denver police Cmd. Bill Nagle told the Denver Post that the accident remains under investigation but authorities have determined drugs and alcohol did not play a factor.

According to a coroner's report the boy would have turned 3 this November.

A candlelight vigil is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Monday near the Vietnam War Memorial at 2200 W. Alameda Ave.
