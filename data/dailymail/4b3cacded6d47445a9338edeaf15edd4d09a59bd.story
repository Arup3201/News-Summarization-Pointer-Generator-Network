A motorcyclist left paralyzed when he was hit by a terrified Range Rover driver who was trying to escape a swarm of bikers last year has claimed he was simply there for a ride.

Speaking to the Today show on Wednesday, Edwin Mieses Jr., 26, denied being part of a gang and said he'd gone to New York with three friends from Massachusetts after seeing the ride advertized on the internet.

The father-of-two was part of a group of bikers allegedly surrounded an SUV driver after he clipped one of them while driving in Manhattan on September 29.

The driver, 33-year-old Alexian Lien, 
was scared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old child, who were 
both in the car, and knocked some of the bikers down so he could escape,
 police said.

Emotional: His wife Dayana wiped away tears as Mieses recalled the moment he was hit by the SUV

But Mieses told the Today show that he never saw any intimidating actions against the driver.

He said he had climbed off his bike to check on the fellow rider who had been clipped when Lien plowed him down.

'I see him [the biker] get hit in the corner of my 
eye,' he said. 'We were all riding together... I just got off like
 any other human would. I got off to check on him to make sure he was 
alright.

'I seen it wasn't really that serious.
 I was telling guys to just keep going - I really didn't want to ruin 
the ride. As soon as I turn around and start walking back toward my bike, that's when I got ran over.

'As soon as he hit me, I shut my eyes. I didn't want to open my eyes because I knew he had hurt me.'

Speaking out: He appeared on the Today show on Wednesday with his wife and lawyer, Gloria Allred

Mieses suffered broken legs and spine injuries that left him paralyzed - and doctors have said it is unlikely he will ever walk again.

'They told me it was 99.9 per cent 
that I wasn't going to walk, but I refuse to believe that,' Mieses said. 'I want to 
walk more than they want me to walk.'

Still, Mieses said he does not blame Lien - who police say was protecting his family - for his injuries.

'I don't blame him,' he said. 'I'm not him to know what was going through his mind.'

Lien was not charged in the incident,
 but Mieses' lawyer Gloria Allred said that, while they have not filed a
 civil lawsuit, they have not ruled it out.

For
 now, Mieses, an aspiring rapper who performed with the name Jay Meezee 
ahead of the crash, is just trying to adjust to his new life. He said 
the incident helped him find his faith.

Caught on camera: Footage of the incident showed the driver, 33-year-old Alexian Lien, hit some of the bikers that had surrounded him last September. Police said he was trying to protect his family

Knocked down: Mieses can be seen lying in the road behind as the SUV continues to drive on

Terrifying: The bikers eventually surrounded the car, tried to smash a window and beat up the driver

'I've realized that life is more important to us than what we take,' he said. 'What
 would I do to be able to walk again or go to the bathroom on my own again - we
 don't value it. It's allowed me to see things from a different angle.'

Startling footage that was later uploaded to the internet captured the terrifying incident last year.

A police spokesman said that Lien recalled how a large number of motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' around him during the annual New York ride and he 'accidentally collided with one'.

The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.

The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.Â 

Scared: Lien, pictured with his wife, was dragged from the car and left needed stitches

Police said the bikers continued to chase Lien and ambushed his car when it came to a stop in Manhattan traffic. They they allegedly dragged him from his car and attacked him.

During the incident, Lien's scared wife, Rosalyn Ng, called 911 four times in nine minutes.

Lien, a Columbia University graduate who now works at Credit Suisse, was taken to Columbia University Medical Center, where he received stitches. He was later released.

Eleven bikers have been indicted in the crash but all cases are still pending.
