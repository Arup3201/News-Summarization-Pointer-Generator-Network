Chris Ramsey will attempt to tame a monster of his own creation on Saturday, but fears talents such as Harry Kane will remain rare so long as clubs and fans apply fickle judgements to their homegrown players.

The QPR manager was instrumental in his 10 years at Tottenham in the rise and breakthrough of Kane, but on Friday recalled the sort of attitudes that mean the 24-goal striker remains something of an exception in this country.

‘We played him towards the end of the season last year and the fans weren't having him,’ Ramsey said. ‘They were trying to get the galacticos on the pitch. We stuck to our guns and got a lot of flak for it.

‘Clubs have to stick their necks out to get English players playing in the Premier League, and getting them judged in the same way as players who cost a lot of money and don't produce.’

In Kane’s case, the bravery of Tim Sherwood and Mauricio Pochettino, his White Hart Lane successor, has been central to the 21-year-old proving he can thrive in the higher reaches of the Premier League. The same can be said of players such as Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Danny Rose, who have all excelled at times this season.

But Ramsey added: ‘I know quite a lot of Spurs fans. I used to tell them about the players coming in. I said to a friend of mine that Ryan Mason is probably the best footballer at the club.

Many Tottenham fans were unhappy when Kane began to play in the first team (he is pictured on his debut in August 2011) but Ramsey says they stuck with him and were rewarded

‘They don’t know what goes on in the background and they were like, “We need this person from this country and we need that guy from that country”. To Tottenham's credit and the manager's (Pochettino) credit, he has come in and has been very brave. All credit to him for being very unbiased to expensive players and actually seeing the players who are on form.

‘What normally happens is a player will go in, not do very well on their first game and then you will never see that player again. And then people will go and buy a player who is similar, who can play 10 bad games and the fans or the people will say, “Oh, he’s got to get used to the Premier League”.

‘Why should a player that £20m be given more favour than the player that comes from down the road and cost less money? That’s one of the biggest problems we have in this country.’
