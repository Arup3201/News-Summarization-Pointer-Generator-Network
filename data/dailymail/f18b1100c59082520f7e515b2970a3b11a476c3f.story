LeBron James returned to the Cleveland hardwood, playing the first half of a preseason game against the Maccabi Tel Aviv that the Cavaliers went on to win handily.

James sunk his first shot back in a Cavaliers jersey, stepping up for a long-range three pointer to open the scoring for Cleveland. 

The four-time MVP scored 12 in the first half, then watched from the bench icing his knees and back while the Cavaliers went on to beat the visiting team from Tel Aviv.

James has been nursing an 'iffy' back in the run-up to the season, sitting out practice Friday and looking to avoid unnecessarily aggravating his back problems.

The Cavaliers showed they had more firepower in their arsenal, going 28-16 against Maccabi with LeBron out of the game. 

New York Times reporting on the game suggested though fans were happy their star was back, the realism of LeBron needing Cleveland less than Cleveland needed him had set in.

Instead, Cleveland sports fans seemed more excited that night to watch the Cleveland Browns pull off a come-from-behind victory against the Titans in Tennessee. 

The post-game attention on James took a negative turn, as all Twitter wanted to talk about was his hair, which unlike LeBron has not returned.

'Lebron's hairline ebbs and rises like the tides,' said user Tweetgood Mac, referencing photos of James in the off-season with a fuller head of hair.

Scalped: James's stock took a beating on Twitter, where users called out how the four-time MVP's headband has been inching back recently to cover his hairline

Gone curl: Twitter users called out James, who had shot a sneaker commercial where it looked like his hair had returned

Dealt: Some users joked about LeBron's hairline while others made genuine pleas for James to finally give up the ghost and go bald

Reporters who had traveled from Israel to see how well Maccabi stacked up against American talent, swarmed the recently returned Cavalier, pressing him about playing under his new coach.

'You guys know the new coach more than I do,' James said. 'I've only been with him for a couple weeks.' 

The night was also memorable for Cavaliers head coach David Blatt, who was playing against the team he had coached for six seasons back in the Euroleague.

'Personally this is a bit of an emotional game for me,' said Blatt. 'I'm playing against the team from which I came and the place from whence I came. Obviously there's some mixed emotions there.'

James now has until Saturday to rest up before confronting his former Miami Heat in a preseason game that's being held in Rio de Janeiro as part of the NBA's Global Games series.

Cleveland plays their season opener at home against the New York Knicks October 30.
