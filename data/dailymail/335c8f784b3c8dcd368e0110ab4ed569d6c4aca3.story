It's been the dream of millions of youngsters over the decades to sit in the cockpit of a NASA shuttle and take the controls while exploring the darkest depths of space.

But judging by the vast array of gadgets and buttons in these pictures of some of the agency's flagship spacecraft, it's little wonder that so few gained the know-how to make that dream a reality.

These pictures give a rare insight into what life at the controls of NASA's three surviving shuttles, Endeavour, Discovery and Atlantis, was like.

The photos were taken by photographer Ben Cooper.

Out of this world: Fascinating new photos give an insight into the vast array of buttons and gadgets which face astronauts in the cockpit of a space shuttle

Not built for comfort: Flight deck chairs for two astronauts look less than homely

Complex: With the vast array of buttons in the craft's flight deck, it's little wonder that most people don't have the know how or get the opportunity to go into space

All three spacecraft were part of NASA's Space Shuttle Programme which launched in 1981.Â 

In all the programme's five shuttles - Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour -- flew 135 missions, helped construct the International Space Station and inspired generations.

The Challenger was destroyed in an accident after take off in 1986 killing all seven crew members, while the Columbia broke up when re-entering the atmosphere on a mission in 2003 also killing seven astronauts.

The Discovery was the first of the three remaining shuttles to be retired in March 2011, almost 27 years after it was initially launched in August 1984.

Buttons galore: Mission operations and controls are on the left of the flight deck while payload controls are on the right

Impressive: The photos were taken by Ben Cooper who was given a rare glimpse inside some of NASA's flagship shuttles

It flew more missions than any other 
shuttle, completing 39 flights safely in 27 years, spending the 
equivalent of almost a full year in space.

The Discovery flew the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit and now sits on display at the National Air and Space Museum in the US.

Space Shuttle Endeavour was launched in May 1992 and taken out of service in May 2011.

It was commissioned to replace the 
destroyed Challenger craft and named Endeavour after Captain James 
Cook's ship following a national schools competition.

The final shuttle to be retired was Atlantis which launched in October 1985 and landed for the final time in July 2011.

Atlantis orbited the Earth 4,848 times
 and travelled a staggering 126million miles - the equivalent of the 
distance between the Moon and Earth 525 times over.

Uncomfortable: The interior of the shuttle shows that life in space is a less than comfortable ride

Dismantled: The mid-deck of the shuttle has lost many of its lockers and storage facilities

Consigned to history: The Endeavour was powered up for the last time ever just a few weeks after these pictured were taken
