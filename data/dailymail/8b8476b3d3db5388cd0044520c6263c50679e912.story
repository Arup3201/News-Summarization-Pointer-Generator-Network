He has endured a few political storms in his time.

So Nigel Farage relished the opportunity to predict the weather himself, as he took a light-hearted view of UKIP's recent gaffes in a spoof forecast.

The Eurosceptic party leader also pulled no punches pointing out the more unsavoury elements of his Westminster rivals in a mock sequence on the BBC's Sunday Politics show.

Spoof: Mr Farage delivered a satirical take on the weather for the BBC's Sunday Politics

'Barmy': The broadcast warned that all political parties contain people with unpalatable views

Mr Farage took the chance to respond to fury at remarks by David Silvester, a UKIP councillor who was suspended for linking recent flooding in Britain to the legalisation of gay marriage.

Mr Silvester caused outrage - and was suspended from the party - after he wrote a letter to his local paper in Henley-on-Thames saying that extreme weather was a punishment visited upon Britain by God after David Cameron pushed through new legislation.

But Mr Farage brushed the incident off as 'a storm in a teacup' and reminded viewers that other parties also harbour embarrassing elements.

Scandal: Mr Farage raised the case of Tory MP Aidan Burley, who organised a Nazi-themed party in a French ski resort

He told viewers to beware of 'outbreaks of sometimes barmy, occasionally extremist views from people of all political persuasions'.

Mr Farage then named-checked Simon Parkes, a Labour councillor in Whitby, who claims that his 'real mother' is a 9ft green alien with eight fingers, as will as a Lib Dem in Wales who was jailed after setting off explosions.

Mr Farage also touched on the scandal of Tory MP Aidan Burley, who organised a Nazi-themed party in a French ski resort. The Mail on Sunday today published further claims that Mr Burley had lied to a formal inquiry into his behaviour.

He opened his mock broadcast by promising to cover the weather for 'All areas of the British Isles... but definitely not Bongo Bongo land', in reference to remarks by former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom attacking the UK's commitment to international aid.

'Avoid light aircraft': The UKIP leader made a self-deprecating reference to the 2010 plane crash he was involved in

Typical: The spoof sequence inevitably showed Mr Farage against a backdrop of beer

The political fortunes of his party also got a mentioned, as Mr Farage focussed on 'rising temperatures' ahead of the European elections this May, in which UKIP hopes to make significant gains.

In a self-deprecating move he also advised viewers to 'avoid light aircraft' - a reference to his own misfortunes on the day of the last general election.

Mr Farage was rushed to hospital on 6 May 2010 after the light aircraft he was flying in crashed in a field. The plane was dragging a UKIP campaign banner behind it.

The UKIP leader was also unable to resist taking a swipe at the European Union. He diverted from the UK's weather to warn that anyone visiting Brussels, where the European Parliament sits, faces 'a warm front of relentless hot air'.
