Neglect: Janette Milne has been banned from owning a dog for two years after her emaciated pet bull terrier had to be put down after swallowing a plug and cable

The owner of a dog that died after swallowing an electric plug and cable has been banned from keeping animals for two years.

Janette Milne failed to get treatment for her English bull terrier Henry - which was found emaciated and unable to lift its head at her home in Inverness.

An x-ray later revealed the animal had swallowed the objects, badly damaging his intestines, and was humanely put down 
because of the injuries he had suffered.

The ruling banning Milne from keeping animals came yesterday after an investigation by Scottish SPCA investigators.

Milne, of South 
Kessock, was convicted at Inverness Sheriff Court in August of causing the dog unnecessary suffering.

The twenty-eight year-old had 
been given Henry only six weeks before he died.

At a previous court hearing Milne’s solicitor Jim Friel said she did not want to lose the right to keep a dog.

Sheriff Ian Abercrombie had deferred 
sentence until this week because social background reports on Milne had not addressed her suitability to care for animals in the future.

Milne had, however, admitted causing the dog unnecessary suffering by failing to provide adequate 
treatment.

The court had heard that when Scottish SPCA inspectors found the sick animal at her home, it was so emaciated and 
unwell it was unable to even lift its head.

Deputy fiscal Heather Swan described 
at a previous hearing how Scottish SPCA inspector Gill MacGregor visited
Milne’s home and went upstairs with her partner to see Henry.

'He was extremely unwell, emaciated, unable to move or lift his head,' she said.

'Milne told the inspector the dog had
been ill for three days and [that] neighbours had been feeding him with 
mushrooms which made him unwell,' said the fiscal.

Ms MacFarlane said Milne regretted what had happened to Henry and accepted she should have sought help for the dog sooner.

But because of her personal circumstances she had not registered him with a vet.

'She said she felt the dog was stressed because of its change of environment, said Ms MacFarlane.

'It is accepted by her she should have taken much more urgent action. She obviously panicked when it became known to her how seriously ill the dog was and is very much devastated by the pain and suffering caused.'

Ms McFarlane said the social work report on Milne said she was a woman with a genuine fondness of animals but because of her personal circumstances was not able to react to her dog's ill health.

She said Milne was concerned 'there may be an order which affects her ownership of a dog.'

Sheriff Peter Anderson told Milne he accepted what had been said about her life and circumstances.

'But the fact remains you did not do anything to help it. I can’t ignore that fact,' he said.

He imposed a £300 fine as well as banning Milne from keeping a dog for two years. Solicitor Diane McFarlane said Milne 
and her partner had another dog that belongs to him.

The ban on Milne does not affect him.
