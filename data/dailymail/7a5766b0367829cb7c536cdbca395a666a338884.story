Sean Dyche is feeling the love from fans of other clubs as he attempts to defy the odds and keep Burnley in the Premier League.

The Clarets have the smallest budget of any team in the top flight but go into the final 12 games of the season separated from safety only by goal difference.

Burnley have covered more miles than any other team this season and matched the global superstars of Manchester City and Chelsea away from home with a squad consisting predominantly of British and Irish players.

If Dyche was in any way concerned Ashley Barnes' controversial clash with Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge last weekend might harm Burnley's appeal, he would have been reassured by a trip to the Etihad on Tuesday.

He said: 'I was at Manchester City the other night and there were loads of City fans coming up saying, ''I hope you do it."

'There's a story behind the story. Written off at the beginning of the season, written off after game 10, and I think there is a stiff-upper-lip mentality to that with British fans.

'That underdog spirit and bulldog spirit, back in the day. I think it's still there, it just needs igniting once in a while, and maybe people deem us to be part of that.'

Burnley are back at Turf Moor this weekend, with Swansea the visitors fresh from their victory over Manchester United.

The Clarets gave United a scare at Old Trafford earlier this month before slipping to a 3-1 loss and then fought back from a goal down to draw 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.

Dyche admitted it has been hard to take that Burnley's performances have not been rewarded with more points.

He said: 'Particularly the last few weeks, I think we've been operating at a very high level. And yet, we've got a couple of points out of three games.

'I'm surprised but that's the nature of the Premier League. It's very tough to win. The next one comes and we'll be ready for it for sure. We're in good shape mentally and physically.

'I think we've got complete freedom to go hard for the next 12 games and see where it takes us.'

Because of Burnley's size relative to their rivals, Dyche has been able to instil belief and expectation into his side while playing the underdog card to dismiss any talk of pressure.

Winger Michael Kightly said: 'Everyone ruled us out last year and said we had no chance of getting promotion and we did that.

'This year before we even started everyone was saying we were going to get relegated, we were going to be way off the mark, and we've proved we're still in the mix, and that's after not winning in the first 10 games.

'We've definitely shown people we're a decent side but we might as well keep that underdog tag and build on it.'

Swansea was Burnley's first away trip of the season, with Nathan Dyer's first-half goal clinching a 1-0 win for the hosts.

'From that day, we believed we were Premier League players,' said Kightly.

'We took our time getting our first win, but once we got that we've really built on the confidence around the place and feel that we're growing. We just need to start turning those performances into wins.'

Kightly has had to bide his time, with Dyche's fondness for a consistent side limiting him to only eight starts this season, but he looks set for a run in the team after Dean Marney's campaign was ended by a cruciate ligament injury.

Kightly replaced Marney in the 2-2 draw against West Brom two weeks ago and kept his place for the games against United and Chelsea.

He said: 'I've been pleased with my last two performances. Obviously it's been a bit frustrating, I haven't played as much as I'd like.

'It is tough. It's taken Dean Marney getting injured for me to play, which is not nice, but I've got to take that opportunity and hopefully I can stay in the team until the end of the season.'
