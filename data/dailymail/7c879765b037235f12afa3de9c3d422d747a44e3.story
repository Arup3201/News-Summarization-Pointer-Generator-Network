Manchester United assistant coach Ryan Giggs has challenged his players to stand up to Premier League frontrunners Manchester City and Chelsea.

United face a double-header against the title favourites following Monday evening's clash with West Brom, with Giggs acknowledging that both encounters will gauge how far the team has developed under Louis van Gaal.

Speaking to the Mirror, Giggs said: 'Chelsea have probably been the standout team so far with City just behind them and we want to be up there testing ourselves against those teams.

'We feel that we do belong up there but we perhaps haven't shown it consistently this season.'

Despite a struggling start to the season, United have risen to fourth in the table after winning three of their last four games, with Giggs confident they are moving in the right direction.

'We've shown glimpses over the last few weeks and hopefully we'll have a lot of players coming back for those games,' said Giggs.

'The form has slowly begun to get better and better and we want to hit form going into those matches.'

Van Gaal insists the first three months of his Manchester United reign have been a success

Meanwhile, Van Gaal responded in typical fashion when asked to assess his performance in the opening three months of his reign.

‘I am always great,’ said Van Gaal. ‘That’s a very easy question. Thankyou! 

‘How do I respond to that? No, I’m not going in the right direction? No. I have confidence in myself and in my players and that is very important. But much more important is that the players have confidence in the manager and his staff.

‘When I respond I’m arrogant because normally I am always moving in the right direction – I have showed that already.’
