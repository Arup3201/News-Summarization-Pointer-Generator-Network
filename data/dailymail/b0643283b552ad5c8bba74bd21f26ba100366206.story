A teenager has been left partially blind after suffering a stroke linked to the contraceptive pill.

Georgie Holland, 18, collapsed after being sent home from college and spent two days in bed before her parents took her to hospital, where a scan revealed a blood clot in her brain that was affecting the flow of blood.

Doctors linked the stroke to her taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin for two years. Georgie now has limited peripheral vision in her right eye and has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood.

Georgie Holland, 18, had a stroke which she thinks was caused by taking the contraceptive pill, Yasmin. The stroke has caused her to partially lose her sight

Georgie spent a week in hospital and has to take daily medication to thin her blood, but she has bounced back to compete in a national pageant in a bid to be crowned ‘The Face of Europe’.

Georgie, of Thrapston, Northamptonshire, said: ‘It came completely out of nowhere. I was in a dance lesson at school and started to feel a bit funny and had to sit down.

‘I was allowed to leave, but I couldn’t think clearly and wasn’t sure what I was doing. I ended up walking out of the school and down the road.

‘My dad was passing, on his way to get me, and saw me collapsed in a bush. I didn’t know why I had decided to walk out of the school.’

Georgie’s father took her home where her condition deteriorated further.

She said: ‘I spent two days in bed before being rushed to the hospital - a doctor was called out to my house as I was too ill to move.

‘He was waving his hands in front of my face but I couldn’t see them, that’s when everyone realised that something was terribly wrong.

‘I felt really sick and it was really frustrating because I knew what I was thinking but I was unable to speak without slurring.

‘When my parents and younger brother were shown my brain scan their faces just dropped, I was so worried what had they seen.

‘When I saw the scan I was shocked - there was a black clot in the middle of my brain which had stopped the blood from flowing.’

Georgie spent a week recovering in hospital and doctors told her family that they believe the stroke was linked to her taking the contraceptive pill, Yasmin, for two years.

It is commonly accepted that Yasmin can, very rarely, cause a patient to suffer a stroke.

In 2011 American mother, Joan Cummins, sued Yasmin's manufacturer, Bayer, claiming that a similar pill, Yaz, had caused her daughter, Michelle Pfleger to have a fatal stroke.

The stroke left Georgie with limited peripheral vision in her right eye - and she has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood.

She also had to re-sit her first year of A Levels.

Georgie said: ‘It wasn’t until my best friend came and visited me in tears that I understood properly what had happened to me.’

Georgie now has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood and prevent another stroke but she still hopes to pursue her dream of becoming a beauty queen

Georgie will be competing against girls from all over the country at the event in Essex on September 15, which would see her compete in the finals at Disneyland Paris if she is successful.

‘I hope the event will help me forget and move on from such a horrifying experience.

‘Losing sight in your eye is very scary, especially as it just happened out of the blue. But I’m ready to compete and win the competition.

‘It would be an extraordinary achievement for me if I did.’

Bayer told MailOnline: 'We extend our sympathies to women and their families who feel that they have been adversely affected by Yasmin®.

'At Bayer we take the safety of our products very seriously and we continuously review the safety profiles of our products.

'Bayer investigates reports on side effects thoroughly and collaborates closely with medical regulatory authorities concerning the use, benefits and risks of all products, including Yasmin®.

'Bayer strongly encourages all patients and healthcare professionals to report adverse events to the company directly or to the MHRA.

'Combined oral contraceptives, like Yasmin®, are among the most systematically studied and widely used medical products available today.

'Based on a thorough assessment of the available scientific data by regulatory authorities, outside independent experts and Bayer scientists, Yasmin® is effective and has a favourable benefit-risk profile when used as directed in the Patient Information Leaflet. Bayer fully stands behind Yasmin®.'

People over the age of 65 have the highest stroke risk but they can occur in people of any age.

Strokes are thought to affect about six children in every 100,000.

In adults, strokes are often caused by high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.

This is rare in children who are more likely to have a stroke caused by diseases of the arteries, heart disorders, infections and abnormal blood clotting.

Children usually recover better than adults from strokes because their brains are still growing.

However, they can develop complications such as seizures, weakness and vision problems.
