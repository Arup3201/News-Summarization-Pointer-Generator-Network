A teenage boy slit the throat of his girlfriend's mother after the young couple hatched a plot to murder both her parents because they disapproved of the relationship.

Pedro Solis, 15, attacked Luz Galvez with a knife on Sunday and threatened her husband's life because they wanted him to stop seeing their 13-year-old daughter, Yaqueline Galvez.

Mrs Galvez, who survived the ordeal, told police that her daughter had lured her outside the family's Florida home so Solis could launch the attack.

He then charged inside the home and held a knife to the unidentified father's throat, but the man escaped without injury and managed to persude Solis to take his wife to hospital, cops told ClickOrlando.

Yaqueline Galvez woke her mother early Sunday morning saying she heard noises in the garage, an arrest affidavit cited by local media said.

Once outside, Luz Galvez was confronted by Solis – he screamed at her to let them stay together and slashed her throat, she told police.

Solis then charged back inside the house and upstairs to the parents’ bedroom where he held a knife to the unidentified father’s throat, authorities said.

The father eventually convinced Solis to take Luz Galvez for help and escaped unscathed.

Hospital staff quickly called police after the mother was dropped off at the emergency room, and the pair was arrested not long after.

Luz Guzman survived emergency surgery and was able to tell investigators what happened, police sources said.

Both teens were arrested and each charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

They are being held in Ocala County Jail without bond.
