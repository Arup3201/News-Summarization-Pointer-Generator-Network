Orders: David Cameron has instructed the Home Office to consider less strict checks

Emergency plans to relax border checks are being drafted by ministers to ease the crisis engulfing Britain’s airports.

David Cameron has ordered the Home Office to consider reintroducing less strict security checks for ‘trusted’ passengers.

The aim is to cut queues of up to three hours at passport control before spectators from all over the world arrive at the Olympics.

The fiasco has become increasingly 
embarrassing in the run-up to the Olympics, prompting fears that Britain
will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here 
from around the world.

Managers at Stansted Airport in Essex were the latest to blast the 'unacceptable' delays for affecting passengers.

Sources said the ‘risk-based approach’ would include relaxation of passport checks for British and European travellers, as well as faster queues for passengers who did not require visas and so-called ‘trusted travellers’ – foreign businessmen who visit regularly and frequent fliers.

The vast majority of non-EU nationals would continue to face full vetting.

The move would represent a partial U-turn after Home Secretary Theresa May last year ordered full-scale checks for every arrival.

In a major immigration scandal - and 
unknown to ministers - guards were told not to bother checking biometric
chips on passports of non-EU citizens or their fingerprints or other 
personal details against the Home Office's so-called Warnings Index of 
terror suspects and illegal immigrants.

Controversy: Brodie Clark lost his £135,000-a-year job as head of the Border Force amid fears that travellers waltzed into Britain without crucial vetting

Brodie Clark, the £135,000-a-year Border Force head, lost his job amid fears that hundreds of thousands of travellers waltzed into Britain without crucial vetting.

Now the Home Office is being pushed to approve a system that would allow officials to apply a 'risk-based approach' to a limited number of passenger checks.

A Whitehall source said: 'We want to introduce "risk-based" checks but it's important that it's done step-by-step and with the full authorisation of ministers.

'Any repeat of last year's fiasco would be a nightmare.'

Critics have warned that the strain 
placed on British airports by the reintroduction of full passport checks
has worsened because of cuts to the number of Border Force officers.

Passport control queues: The fiasco has prompted fears that Britain will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here from around the world for the Olympics

Last week it was revealed that passengers were storming past border guards at Britain's airports in frustration at lengthy queues at passport control.

Trade unions claimed that customs staff had been switched from checking for drugs and arms smuggling and instead were helping check travel documents.

Paul O'Connor, the Home Office national manager for the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), said the cut in border controls had led to an increase in small-scale drug smuggling into the UK. The Home Office vehemently denied the claim.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'This border chaos isn't just another government shambles, it is now becoming a security risk.

'Theresa May needs to investigate these breaches urgently, and make sure security is being maintained.

'She needs to make sure that appropriate customs checks are still taking place and that panic action to staff the passport desks is not leaving customs completely empty.'
