The tearful families of three soldiers killed in Afghanistan were today joined by hundreds of mourners to watch their bodies being brought back home.

Sergeant Gareth Thursby and Private Thomas Wroe, both of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, were shot on Saturday when a man dressed as a local Afghan policeman pretended to be injured so they would help him.

A day earlier, Lance Corporal Duane Groom, of The Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, was killed when his vehicle struck an improvised explosive device.

The three families stood side by side in the memorial garden in Carterton, in Oxfordshire, as they watched the cortege of three hearses approach.

The men’s bodies were earlier flown into RAF Brize Norton where the Union flag-draped coffins were carried from the plane with full military honours.

At the side of the road in Carterton, more than 20 Royal British Legion standard-bearers slowly lowered their flags in salute.

Relatives clutched bunches of flowers including white roses and held onto small wooden crosses while family members of Fiji born L/Cpl Groom sang soft hymns.

The families were supported by more than 300 friends and well-wishers - many with tears in their eyes as they shook their heads when the coffins passed by.

The cortege was escorted at walking pace past the memorial garden, where it paused briefly next to a Union flag hung at half mast.

Family members and friends stepped forward to place their flowers on top of the hearses, with some also placing their hands against the glass and bowing their heads.

As the cars pulled away there was a spontaneous round of applause by members of the public who came to pay their respects.

Married father-of-two Sgt Thursby, 29, and Pte Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province.

Sgt Thursby from Skipton, North Yorkshire, is survived by his wife Louise and two children, Joshua and Ruby. Pte Wroe was deployed to Afghanistan on July 1, shortly after his 18th birthday.

Third fatality: Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb

He leaves his parents, Michael and Claire, and sister Demi, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.

The Ministry of Defence said an investigation was under way into the circumstances of the soldiers’ deaths.

Lieutenant Richard Keaveney, a company administration officer for D Company The Yorkshire north and west army cadet force, said Pte Wroe came to them as a cadet at the age of 13 and stayed with them until he was 16-years-old.

Speaking about the way in which Pte Wroe’s life was taken he said: 'I think it proves one thing that, even though what happened, that our guys will help anybody, they will come to somebody’s aid no matter what.

'It is just the nature that we are and the way that we are and the way that we are taught in that we don’t see people struggle and Tom Wroe was an ambassador for that really.'

Lt Keaveney, from Huddersfield, said he travelled down to Oxfordshire with a group of people to pay tribute to the man he knew as a 'keen and eager' young man.

'He was a keen individual, a comedian sometimes, a cheeky guy, but with one of those personalities that you couldn’t fail to like him, always willing to learn, always willing to teach, because he experienced quite a lot as a cadet and he used to pass that on to the other kids that were coming through, just an out and out genuine, brilliant young man.'

Prayers were also being held in Pte Wroe’s home town today.

The Bishop of Wakefield, the Rt Reverend Stephen Platten, expressed his shock at the deaths and offered his sympathy to their families.

Bishop Platten said: 'This death will devastate the families and friends of those involved and the local community of Meltham.

'My prayers and condolences are with all those who have suffered the loss of a loved one. The Church will be doing all it can to support the communities and people affected.'

The shooting happened just a day after L/Cpl Groom was also killed during a bloody few days in the war-torn country.

The 32-year-old, who was born in Suva City, Fiji, was protecting his Afghan and British colleagues as they extracted from a successful operation when he was killed in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province.

Lieutenant Colonel James Bowder, Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said: 'Lance Corporal Groom was an outstanding soldier in every respect.

'Tough, keen and unflappable, he was utterly committed to his fellows and the cause.

'We are all tremendously proud of what he achieved during his time in the regiment, and particularly out here in Afghanistan where he contributed so much.'

The number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 now stands at 430.
