This might just be the best wake-up call ever.

The Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida, has come up with a very unique way to ensure that guests rise and shine during their spring break holiday - by blasting Circle of Life.

A classic Disney tune, Circle of Life was made famous by the studio's 1994 animated film, The Lion King.

Since 2012, the Holiday Inn resort has been performing this particular ritual, and guests now dance and sing along when it is blasted by a DJ.

Each March, when the hotel is full of twenty-something spring breakers, staff play the track at 11am to ensure that everyone is up and ready for another day of partying in the sun.

'It was a song that worked real well as a wake-up call because of the loud beat in it and it also works real well because of the message of the song,' Holiday Inn Marketing Director Philip Corvin told WJHG. 

'For these kids, this would have been one of their first Disney movies. We thought it would be kind of neat to play something from their childhood and see how they react to it.'

And while it started as just a funny idea, it's clearly become as big of a hit with the spring break attendees as it has with hotel management.

'We were overwhelmed by how they reacted to it,' Corvin continued.

'We've done all sorts of songs as a wake up song and none of them had the reaction that this one did.' 

'I think it's awesome,' said one spring break guest, according to Consumerist. 'I cried the first day because I was so happy. I thought it was so cool.'
