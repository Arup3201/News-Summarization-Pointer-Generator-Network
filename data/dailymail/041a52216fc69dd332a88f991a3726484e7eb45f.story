Gary Oldman branded himself 'an A-hole' as he once again begged for forgiveness over his 'insensitive' Playboy interview in which he claimed Hollywood is 'a town run by Jews.'

The actor insisted he 'should have known better' as he made an appearance to promote Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday.

In an interview the chat show host admitted he thought would be cancelled, the English star insisted he had no idea how much ill-feeling his rant, in which he complained about political correctness, would cause.

So sorry: Gary Oldman again begged for forgiveness over his now infamous Playboy interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday

Gary, who is in the middle of promoting 
his forthcoming summer blockbuster, caused outrage 
after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous 
use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets.

He said: 'It was an article I did with Playboy and I said some things that were poorly considered, and once I had seen it in print, I could see it was, um, offensive, insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed.

'And, uh, well, words have meaning, they carry weight, they carry on long after you've said them, and I don't condone or excuse the words I used in any context.

I just basically shouldn't have used them in any context. But I did an I have deeply injured and wounded a great many people.'

No case for the defence: The English actor made no excuses for his expletive filled interview

Public figure: Gary said he had set a bad example and apologised to the fans he lovingly calls Team Oldman

Saving his bacon? It remains to be seen whether his grovelling will stop Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes from sinking at the box office

Working class Gary, who is the son of a welder, then thanked the chat show star for allowing him on his show to make his apology.

He said: 'It gives me the opportunity to say to those people that I am, from my heart, I am profoundly, profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic, especially to the fans because they have been so incredible to me and very loyal.'

The actor then said he should have been mindful to be a better role model to the supporters he calls Team Oldman.

He said: 'I am a public figure, I should be an example and inspiration and I am an a—hole.

'I am 56. I should know better. So to them I say I extend my apology and my love and best wishes to my fan base.'

The Leon star also took a shot at the media for wanting stars to be more than mere performers.

Gary said: 'I just think that we're 
public figures and sometimes we're looked upon, we're are asked to be, 
social or cultural or political commentators, and, I can't speak for 
other people, but I'm not, clearly.

A musing actor: The Dracula star was thinking before speaking this time as he chatted with Jimmy

Really? The Fifth Element favourite made the confession he is unqualified to be a social commentator

'I stepped out of my area of expertise and I just landed both feet in a hornets nest.

'It just came over in a certain way and for that I'm deeply sorry.

The Londoner, who admitted his overlords are 'furious' at the publicity his comments have attracted, still found time to laugh when Jimmy made 'the most awkward transition possible' by asking about his new film.

His guest admitted: 'I only ever wanted to talk about Planet of the Apes, you know, and this thing, this news cycle, this event has I think sadly um, it derailed what my initial purpose was.

And after talking about how great the cast and crew are he joked, 'Its a relief, believe me I desperately want to talk about Planet Of The Apes.'

Begging for forgiveness: Gary Oldman has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new Playboy interview

The Harry Potter star had already made a grovelling 
apology to the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, in
 which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.'

However the gorup's national national 
director Abraham H. Foxman was no impressed, saying “At this point, we 
are not satisfied with what we received. His apology is insufficient and
 not satisfactory.'

He added the group 'just began a conversation with his managing producer,' who had claimed the star's comments had been taken out of context.

This was despite Gary sending a statement to the group in which he addressed the 'gentlemen' of the organisation.

He wrote: 'I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people.

'Upon reading my comments in print - I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype.

'Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter.'

The Dark Knight Rises favourite went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine, insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness.

He said: 'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews invented Hollywood.

'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution.

'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I
 have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, 
and those specifically in my life.'

He then finished by begging for forgiveness, going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a Hebrew greeting meaning 'peace be upon you.'

The self described libertarian said: ''The Jewish People, persecuted thorough the ages, are the first to hear God’s voice, and surely are the chosen people. 

Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes

'I would like to sign off with “Shalom Aleichem”—but under the circumstances, perhaps today I lose the right to use that phrase, so I will wish you all peace.'

Gary, who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes film, caused outrage after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets.

He also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy.

The Dracula star insisted: 'Mel Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough.

'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know?

''But some 
Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That f***ing
 kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to 
be so politically correct. That's what gets me.'

Gibson,
 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested for suspected 
drink-driving in Malibu in 2006, two years after his film The Passion Of
 The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively.

'He's alright': Gary claimed 'everyone' has used racial slurs like Mel Gibson and should forgive him

His words prompted an angry backlash, with antisemitism group the Anti-Defamation League's national director Abraham H. Foxman saying: 'He should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-Semitic tropes.

'Mel Gibson’s ostracization in Hollywood was not a matter of being "politically incorrect," as Mr. Oldman suggests, but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater.

'It is disturbing that Mr. Oldman appears to have bought into Mr. Gibson’s warped and prejudiced world view.'

He also added the assertion Jews control Hollywood is, 'an anti-Semitic stereotype based on the "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the 19th Century anti-Semitic forgery that suggested Jews conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance.'

The apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the English star's camp, with his manager Douglas Urbanski earlier saying: 'This notion that he's defending Mel and Alec is preposterous. Gary Oldman would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech. The piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard.'
