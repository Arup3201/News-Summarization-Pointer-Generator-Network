A jobless single mother boasted ‘at least I’m famous’ after being banned from 80 stores because of her serial shoplifting.

Jade Underwood, 23, also made neighbours’ lives a misery and verbally abused mothers taking children to a nearby school.

Her antics led to a torrent of complaints and to her being officially branded a nuisance when police obtained a Crasbo – a criminal anti-social behaviour order.

Foul-mouthed: Jade Underwood waged a war of terror against her community and brought misery to shopkeepers during her shoplifting sprees

A Crasbo differs from an Asbo in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction has been made.

The Crasbo bars the mother-of-three from the main shopping street, primary school and supermarkets which she targeted.

Bright yellow posters bearing her 
grim-faced photo have been put up around the area to encourage residents
to report her to police if she flouts the bans.

But Underwood posted a defiant, 
misspelt message on Facebook, saying: ‘Heyy yah dont bring me down, 
least am famouse!! Yah all whata leve meh alone.’

Yesterday shopkeepers and neighbours told how the 5ft menace treated shoplifting like a job and blighted their lives.

One said she was such a problem that the local branch of Boots in Edgeley, Stockport, stopped putting make-up out on display.

Former neighbour John Duggan, 55, said Underwood had ‘absolutely no shame whatsover’.
‘She used to wear tracksuits and looked just like Vicky Pollard from the
TV show [Little Britain],’ he said. ‘She is a little toad, she’s just 
horrible.

‘She would openly say to me “I’m going shoplifting today”, she was not ashamed. I couldn’t believe it.
‘She would come back with food mostly, shoplifting was her full-time 
job. She didn’t work, she said she was better off on benefits.’

Underwood also used to keep neighbours awake by playing loud music until 5am, said Mr Duggan.
She has now been evicted from her tower block flat and moved a few miles to Withington in Manchester.

Glynis Barber, who runs CJ Cardcraft 
and is in the local traders’ group, said: ‘People don’t realise how 
expensive shoplifting can be for the shop. Not just the cost of the 
goods but I have installed nine CCTV cameras to make sure every aisle 
and the back room is covered.

Terror: Posters of Underwood's face and details of the order punishment have been distributed and put up in the area in case she breaches the ban

‘When I go to Boots for make-up. they’ve stopped putting it out on the shelves and I have to go upstairs for it.’

Javed Faruqh, 55, who runs Alm Newsagents, said Underwood came in daily, stealing goods and racially abusing him.

A Boots store was targeted so many times by Underwood staff stopped putting make-up on the shelves to avoid it from being stolen

‘I had to always ask her to leave,’ he said. ‘She would steal drinks and sweets.
‘She would always come back. It was very frustrating. Hopefully this Crasbo will work.’

Richard Coaton, a governor at 
Larkhill Primary School, said: ‘I am just relieved parents and children 
will not have to suffer abuse from this person.’

If Underwood breaches the two-year ban imposed by Stockport magistrates, she could face up to five years in jail.

The court described her as a 
‘prolific shoplifter’ who ‘on numerous occasions used language and 
behaviour that has caused considerable alarm, harassment and  distress 
to shop staff’.

Inspector Pete Smith, of Greater 
Manchester Police, said: ‘We will give the posters to homes and shops 
affected and put them in public buildings.’
