Admirable: Double amputee Norman Croucher OBE, at his home in Exeter, Devon. He has bowel cancer but plans to climb the Alps next year for charity

A disabled pensioner who lost both his legs as a teenager has defied expectations by climbing more than 100 mountains.

Norman Croucher OBE, 72, has scaled some of the world’s most brutal peaks in ranges including the Alps and the Himalayas.

A keen climber from a young age, doctors told him he would have to sacrifice his hobby when, at the age of 19, he had both his legs amputated after falling onto railway tracks into the path of an oncoming train.

But despite warnings from friends and family, he refused to give up - and has spent the 53 years since taking on death-defying mountain climbs.

The smallest ascent he has scaled was more than 8,200 feet tall - and he has even tackled a 26,000-foot summit in the Himalayas.

Despite recently been diagnosed with cancer, he has vowed to carry on.

Mr Croucher, of Exeter, Devon, who is now preparing himself for a charity expedition to the Alps, describes his hobby as an addiction.

He said: 'Climbing is an addiction. I say, life’s like a muscle and if you don’t stretch it, it’ll waste away and climbing for me is like stretching the muscle of life.

'It gives me something to aim for. I’m going to be less active for a while, but I’ll be okay for the trip next year.'

Mr Croucher started climbing trees during his rehabilitation stint and as soon as he got his prosthetics he took to scaling the cliffs near his home on England's southern coast.

Death-defying: Here he climbs a 17,880-ft mountain in Tocllaraju, Peru. The smallest he has scaled was 8,200ft

Passion: Despite warnings from doctors, family and friends, he continued after losing his legs in 1960

Beneficial: Mr Croucher says amputated legs are useful in climbing - less body heat to lose, less weight to lift

Accident: This picture of Norman, 17, was taken two years before he was hit by an oncoming train

The pensioner has now climbed mountains 
around the world including the Matterhorn, the Eiger and Mont Blanc in 
the Alps and the White Needle in the Kashmiri Himalayas.

He can also add Muztagh Ata in China and the sixth highest mountain in the world, Cho Oyo in Tibet, to his impressive list of conquests.

Mr Croucher said that not having any legs wasn’t always a disadvantage and in some ways he felt it had helped him when climbing.

He said: 'Because there’s less of me and I have a shorter blood circuit, I oxygenate better.

'So I may be slower on the lower mountain but then among the first party at the top.

'And because there’s less body surface to lose heat from, I keep warmer as well so often I’m more comfortable that the others.

'And there are advantages on long distance flights too.

'I can take my legs off and stretch out over two seats and have quite a good sleep.'

Norman was awarded an OBE for his work promoting adventurous sports for disabled people.

He fought against those who held the view that only mainstream competitive sports were suitable for disabled people.

Rewarded: Mr Croucher received an OBE for his support of disabled people in sport. He could not understand why amputees couldn't climb world wonders everywhere from Peru's Alpamayo (left) to Cornwall's cliffs (right)

Records: Mr Croucher, a retired social worker, was the first amputee to walk John O'Groats to Land's End in 1969

He went on to prove that sailing, tobogganing and zip wiring were all still accessible for those with disabilities.

And in 1969, he also became the first person fitted with artificial limbs to walk the 900 miles from John O’Groats to Lands End.

In June, with two friends, Mr Croucher will take on two or three 11,500-ft peaks around Chamonix in the French Alps to raise funds for Exeter Hospiscare.
