Big cheese: Former grammar school boy Steve Easterbrook has become the head of McDonald's

He used to take the train to Harrow as an 11-year-old and eat in the local McDonald’s as a special treat.

Now 36-years later Steve Easterbook is the first Brit to cross the pond and take over as chief executive of the fast food giant.

Born in Watford, the 47-year-old takes the helm at a troubled time for the firm which has seen fierce competition from rivals deemed to produce fresher and healthier burgers.

McDonalds saw its sales fall for the first time 12 years last year, and Easterbrook has been drafted in to mirror the turnaround he staged when running its European arm.

The firm already to open fewer restaurants in regions with poorer growth.

Born in 1967, Mr Easterbrook attended Watford Boys Grammar School and studied Natural Sciences at Durham University before qualifying as an accountant with Price Waterhouse.

A father to three girls, by 1993 he had moved to work within McDonald’s UK finance department.

Five years on he begun running restaurants and spent 18 months training in Chicago at McDonald’s Hamburger University.

He said previously he had made ‘the seemingly illogical move in 1998 from a good finance role to becoming a McDonald’s restaurant manager'.

But, her added, it was to be 'a move which opened up more opportunities from me than I ever would have imagined.’

Following a stint of management roles in Britain he became chief executive of the UK business in 2006, and was given responsibility for other northern countries within months.

He became McDonald’s chief in Europe and the UK, overseeing 7,000 restaurants in 39 countries.

Under his watch from its U.S. headquarters the firm introduced healthier menus, quality coffee and a new look for the company’s restaurants.

He has said: ‘Money is not my primary motivator, but it is important to me to be rewarded fairly for the results that I help to deliver.’

Mr Easterbrook cites Warren Buffet as the person he most admires in business.

‘I’ve never met him,’ he has said. ‘But I love the simplicity with which Warren Buffet describes good and bad businesses and how he makes his investment decisions.’
