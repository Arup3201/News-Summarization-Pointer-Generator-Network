Brave: Nia Haines, from South Wales, scales heights ten times her bigger than her

Scaling expertly up a steep rock face Nia Haines smiles widely as she reaches the top - it was just another adventure for the brave six-year-old who regularly climbs heights ten times taller than her.

The youngster from South Wales takes on everything from 40ft cliffs to quarries.

Nia just can’t get enough of climbing - be it trees, in the playground or mountain rock faces.

She is happiest spending her weekends
away climbing huge rock faces usually tackled by adults, and thinks 
nothing of finding her footings to the highest peaks.

Nia, from South Wales, caught the climbing bug after accompanying her mum when she first took it up in an attempt to overcome her fear of heights - and she has not looked down since.

Sue Haines said: 'She started climbing about three years ago, when I first got into it.

'She would take on anything and has no fear- the higher the better.

'She
likes the idea she’s higher than everyone else and she’ll turn around 
when she’s higher than us and say, ‘I’m bigger than you!’

Ms Haines 39, started climbing three years ago to overcome her fear of heights and took Nia and her sister Megan, 9, with her.

She
said: 'I have an awful fear of heights which is why I started 
rock-climbing in the first place and I only feel safe when I know I’m 
strapped to a harness.

Plucky: Nia caught the climbing bug from her rockclimbing mum, Sue, and has not looked down since

'Then I went to climbing outdoors and took the girls with me, and Nia just loved it.

'She took to it straight away. Both the girls started with indoor walls and then we started going away on weekends to do the rock faces.

'She now owns her own kit - shoes, harness, helmet.

Family hobby: Ms Haines, right takes her children away for the weekends rock-climbing either in the Peak District or to quarries and rock faces in and around Wales

Impressive: Mia scales up to 40-feet high as one of Britain's youngest climbers

'And it’s not just walls, if there’s a tree nearby she would be up it, or climbing frames in the playground.

'She’s happy doing it and that’s the main thing.'

Ms Haines and her partner, Stuart Jamieson, take the kids away for the weekends rock-climbing either in the Peak District or to quarries and rock faces in and around Wales.

Ms Haines added: 'She’s quite sporty anyway and like gymnastics and ballet, but none of her friends go rock-climbing.

'She will start classes when she’s seven, which is the age you can begin at our closest centre, but she will be able to skip a few levels.'
