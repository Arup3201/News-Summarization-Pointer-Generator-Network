Lionel Messi and his Argentina teammates took a break from training in America to pose for a photo with professional basketball player Pablo Prigioni.

The Argentinian-Italian baller, who plays for the Houston Rockets, spent time with the squad as they prepared for their upcoming clash against Ecuador just days after beating El Salvador.

Gerardo Martino's side dominated that game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Nestor Renderos own goal deflected from Ever Banega's shot.

Substitute Federico Mancuello then made sure of the win with a free kick from a tight angle on 88 minutes to ensure they were rewarded for the performance.

Martino started Carlos Tevez for the first time since taking over the team last year during the game as Messi missed out.

The upcoming game against Ecuador will be Argentina's last warm-up match before the Copa America in June and the Barcelona wizard is expected to regain his place in the starting line-up.
