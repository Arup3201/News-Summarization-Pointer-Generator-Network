A California man who went missing right before he was scheduled to testify in a high-profile burglary case has now been arrested for the same crime after he was found wandering Los Angeles on Friday.

Darwin Vela, 22, claims he was was attacked by strangers while walking his chocolate lab just two days before he was set to testify as a witness in the burglary case of Christina Fulton, the mother of actor Nicholas Cage's son Weston. 

But authorities told TMZ they didn't buy his story that he was hiding from his attackers for three days, and arrested Vela and his fiance Kelly McLaren today.

Prosecutors believe Vela, McLaren and the
man currently on trial - Fulton's handyman Ricardo Orozco - worked 
together to steal four computers and other items from Fulton's home. 

Arrested: Darwin Vela, 22, is now being charged in the burglary of Christina Fulton after he disappeared a few days before he was set to testify as a witness . Police found him wandering around Los Angeles Friday

Burglary: The home of Christina Fulton, right, who dated Nicolas Cage, 
left, from 1988 to 1990, was broken into earlier this year. Vela was 
meant to testify against the alleged thief who reportedly stole four 
computers and a box of sex pictures from her home

Among the loot may be a sex tape involving Charlie Sheen. The three approached representatives of the actor after the burglary, trying to blackmail him with the alleged sex tape.

Vela was found around 1:30pm on Friday about two blocks from a Los Angeles police precinct, covered in bruises, scrapes and red marks. 

Three days prior he was reported missing after taking his dog Koco for a walk about 9pm. His fiance said the dog  later returned home without his owner and there blood stains on the leash.

Witnesses: Vela and his girlfriend, Kelly McLaren were scheduled to testify against a man who is standing trial for breaking into the home of Nicholas Cage's ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton

Turned around: Now Vela and McLaren are suspects in the case

At the time, Vela claimed he had been 
kidnapped and attacked by three men who pulled a gun on him. He said he 
was able to escape but was so terrified he didn't return home and his 
for three days. 

'He 
ran from there and was so afraid he didn't return,' Lt Julian Melendez 
said. 'He has pretty much been walking the streets for the last three 
days.'

But police began to question his story when he gave two versions of the story to officers during questioning.

Law enforcement officials told TMZ 
that they believe Vela was never attacked, and that he was just hiding 
in order to avoid testifying.

Vela and his fiance are now accused of working with Orozco to steal from Fulton's home earlier this year.

Fulton is the mother of 22-year-old Weston Coppola Cage, who she had with actor Nick Cage.

Weston,
22,  was the lead singer of the black metal band Eyes Of Noctum that 
disbanded last year and has since joined metal band Arsh Anubis.

Fulton,
who dated Cage from 1988 to 1990, has had roles in films as The Doors, 
Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dangerous Game, The Girl with the Hungry Eyes, 
Enemies of Laughter, Lucinda's Spell and Snake Eyes.

Cage has been married three times with his marriages to actress Patricia Arquette and Lisa Marie Presley ending in divorce.

The actor, who is the nephew of Godfather producer Francis Ford Coppola, married his third wife Alice Kim, a former waitress, in 2004. They have eight-year-old son Kal-El together.

Police arrested Fulton's handyman, Ricardo Orozco, 39, on October 22 and charged him with felony burglary after he reportedly broke into Fulton's house and made away with four computers and a box of sex pictures.

Vela and McLaren are both being held on 20,000 bail at the Los Angeles County Jail.
