It’s the big day that requires months of planning.

However, a hotel chain is offering to do the legwork for a bride and groom – by putting a wedding package worth £4,000 up for auction on eBay.

The Best Western offer includes the civil ceremony, wedding breakfast with half a bottle of wine for 50 people, and an evening hog roast buffet for 100 guests.

With bidding starting at £1,250, the three-star Llyndir Hall Hotel deal also includes a DJ, overnight accommodation for the bride and groom, complimentary upgrade for their parents and special room rates for friends and family. 

The only decision the winning couple needs to make is choosing from the two dates available – January 17th or 24th, 2015 – for the wedding at the rural retreat in Chester, North Wales.

The deal – which is the first wedding package to be auctioned by the hotel on eBay – also includes a red carpet welcome, a glass of champagne for the couple, and an event manager acting as dedicated toastmaster.
