Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs

The sordid past of disgraced Co-op bank boss Reverend Paul Flowers was laid bare today after it emerged he has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having pornography on his computer.

The fallen Methodist minister is already 
being investigated by the police after apparently buying hard drugs, 
including crack cocaine and crystal meth.

But it has now been revealed that in the past 30 years he has been involved in a series of sex scandals.

In 1981 he was convicted of gross indecency after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a trucker in a public toilet - but he was forgiven by the church.

Rev Flowers, who is gay, admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates' Court in Hampshire and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs, yet his church let him continue in his job because he was sorry.

He also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after 'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he used, the city council said today.

A rent boy claimed today that the Methodist also used his Co-op email account to organise drug-fuelled sex sessions with and others while he was still chairman of the bank.

After his gross indecency conviction, Flowers told magistrates he was 'shamed and embarrassed' about the incident, but maintained he was involved 'at the other man's 
instigation'.

Yet he was allowed to continue as a Methodist minister.

'This was a matter for our usual procedures and after that process was complete it was decided he could continue as a minister,' a Methodist Ministry spokesman said.

'This matter did not preclude him from his activities in the church. He was very contrite, and he continued his work',

Flowers served as a member of Bradford
 Council’s executive from May 2010 to August 2011, when he stepped down 
from the post, saying he had “increasing and competing demands” on his 
time.

The following month he resigned as a Labour councillor for the Great Horton ward, having served on the council since 2001.

At
 the time, he said in a statement: 'It has become clear to me that, over
 the longer term, I will be unable to sustain the workload associated 
with performing both roles to the best of my ability.'

But
 the council said today: 'Inappropriate but not illegal adult content 
was found on a Council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for 
servicing.

'This was put to him and he resigned immediately.'

It comes days after the Mail on Sunday
 revealed Rev Flowers bought hard drugs just after he was grilled by MPs
 on the Treasury Select Committee over the bank's disastrous 
performance.

In the 
shocking video the 63-year-old was seen in his car discussing the 
cocaine and crystal meth he wants from a dealer in Leeds.

He then counts out £300 in £20 notes and sends a friend to make the deal.

The Co-operative Group said today its 
chairman Len Wardle had resigned with immediate effect, days after the 
former chairman became embroiled in the drugs scandal.

Flowers was the £132,000-a-year 
chairman of the 'ethical' Co-op Bank from 2010 until May this year when 
he stepped down as the bank's financial woes became apparent. The bank 
lost £700 million in the first six months of this year.

On
 the day after his appearance at the Commons, Flowers sent a text 
reading: 'I was "grilled" by the Treasury Select Committee yesterday and
 afterwards came to Manchester to get wasted with friends.

The video and a series of damning text messages leaked by acquaintance Stuart Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy'.

The text messages prove Rev Flowers 
was using hard drugs in the days surrounding his crucial testimony to 
the Treasury Committee on November 6.

A parishioner who worships at Flowers' Bradford church last night told The Sun: 'The revelations are repulsive. 
People idolised him.'

Twenty
 or so years ago, Flowers came to public attention as vice-chairman of 
Rochdale Council’s social services committee during the ‘satanic abuse’ 
fiasco between 1988 and 1991.

It involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being performed on children and, as a result, 20 children from six families were placed in care.

However, the police found no evidence and a government-backed inquiry subsequently blamed ‘evangelical Christians’ for the scare.

Flowers maintained a high profile, sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects.

Ironically, given recent events, from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently involved with the Lifeline Project, which helps drug abusers. Today he remains a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV/Aids charity.

Reverend Paul Flowers used his Co-op bank email account to organise nights with a £650-per-session rent boy, it emerged today.

The disgraced Methodist minister, 63, who was forced to quit his £130,000 role in June, organised drug-fuelled gay sex at hotels while he was still in the job, according to the escort involved.

Emails reveal he would pay for threesomes, taking the rent boys for expensive dinners before going to bed together.

The liaisons were organised while he was running the Co-Op bank, which at the time he was in charge lost £700million.

'I knew what he did for a living and couldn't believe how debauched he was,' escort Ciaron Dodd, 21, told The Sun.

'Every
 time he saw me he knew he was risking everything — but he just didn't 
seem to care. He took me to the theatre and gave me presents like 
chocolate and wine. I was old enough to be his grandson but he didn't 
seem to think we looked like the odd couple.'

The emails from Flowers' Co-op account reveal how he was happy to discuss sex and drugs, despite his public position.

One email to the rent boy says: 'Been waiting for you to come and have some coke (cocaine) and k (Ketamin) with me. P x.'

Email chain: Rev Flowers admitted he had threesomes in the past, but could only afford one rent boy on this occasion

Drug reference: This email, also sent to Ciaron says he wanted to take cocaine and ketamin with him

In another exchange, the rent boy asks if he can bring his friend Lucas.

Flowers replied: 'I like him a lot - but I can't afford 2 of you this time! PXx'.

According to his Facebook page Mr Dodds lives in Warrington, Cheshire and is a 'part time model' working in the catering industry.

But the page was taken down after friends began to post messages attacking him for going public about his meetings with Flowers.

He claimed the relationship ended when Flowers refused to pay £2,000 he owed.
