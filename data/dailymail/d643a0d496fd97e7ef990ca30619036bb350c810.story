A team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find 'the loneliest whale in the world' next autumn by tracking its route across the North Pacific Ocean.

The researchers have been listening to the animal's abnormally high song for over 20 years but have never seen what it looks like.

The unknown whale is called 'lonely' because it appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the North Pacific, and so far, it is not thought to have ever got a response to its plaintive cries.

Experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale, but could be a blue whale, or a hybrid of the two species, Discovery News reported.

The US Navy began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s.

It picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the North Pacific.

In 1989, Dr William Watkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale's song was much higher in pitch than the others.

Most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz.

When more recordings were released in the nineties, Dr Watkins studied the 52 hertz whale more closely.

Scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no-one has seen it, so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for. Experts believe the huge mammal is is most likely that it is a fin whale (pictured) but could be a hybrid of a blue and a fin whale

Dr Watkins' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season, when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004.

Mary-Ann Daher, who was involved with the research said that it is usually incredibly difficult to track a whale across the ocean without seeing it as the animals make noises at the same frequency, making it almost impossible to pick out individuals.

The study attracted much media attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed 'the loneliest whale in the world' as its high-pitched song did not seem to get a response from other whales.

As Dr Watkins sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public, his research assistant  Ms Daher has carried on his scientific legacy.

She said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is.

They do not know if it is medically unusual but she said it is obviously healthy as it has been living for at least two decades.

However, when it came to musing about the creature's loneliness, Ms Daher said: 'Is he alone? I don’t know.

'People like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome, just singing away and nobody’s listening. But I can’t say that.'

Scientists may find out more about the mysterious whale when they search for it next Autumn.

While the whale has been dubbed the 'loneliest in the world' as its calls seem to be going unanswered, scientists are not so sure. They cannot say for sure that the creature is completely alone. A blue whale is pictured
