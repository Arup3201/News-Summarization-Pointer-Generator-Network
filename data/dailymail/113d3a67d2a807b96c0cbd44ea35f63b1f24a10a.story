James Tomkins has denied assaulting a police officer outside a nightclub famous among celebrities.

West Ham defender Tomkins, 24, appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court after he was arrested at the Sugar Hut in Brentwood, Essex, during the early hours of December 22.

He was also charged with resisting arrest and being drunk and disorderly after security staff at the popular venue called the police at around 12.30am.

Tomkins spoke only to confirm his name and not guilty pleas to all three charges during the short administrative hearing.

He was released on unconditional bail ahead of trial at Basildon Magistrates' Court on April 17.

Outside court, Sanjay Panesar, of Rainer Hughes solicitors, said: 'We are going to be vigorously contesting this.'

On the Saturday just hours before the alleged incident, Tomkins had played for the Hammers in a 3-1 defeat by Manchester United.

He has missed the last two games - cup defeats by Nottingham Forest and Manchester City - after limping off injured against West Brom on December 28.

The alleged incident outside Sugar Hut, made famous on reality television show The Only Way Is Essex,  occurred on the same day
that Tomkins and his West Ham team-mate Jack Collison encouraged fans to enjoy alcohol responsibly in 
the club's official Christmas video.

In the 90 second clip, which 
includes words from a number of first-team players, the midfielder tells
viewers: 'Drink responsibly, enjoy your presents and enjoy yourselves. 
Have a fantastic Christmas.'

Tomkins, who smiles as his team-mate delivers his message, adds: 'Have a good Christmas and a great New Year. Keep well.'

Tomkins lives in a £400,000 flat 
in Brentwood, Essex. He is believed to earn £35,000
a week after coming through the club's academy system, going on 
to make 137 senior appearances since his first-team debut in 2008.

The
former England Under 21 player represented Great Britain at 
the 2012 Olympic Games.

West

jaunt to Dublin in December as the club look to battle their way 
out of danger.

In the Premier League, West Ham last won
on November 30 when Mohamed Diame, Carlton Cole and Joe Cole sealed a 
3-0 win over fellow strugglers and London rivals Fulham.

Last weekend's 5-0 defeat by Forest ended West 
Ham's FA Cup run at the first hurdle while free-scoring City put six 
past Sam Allardyce's side without reply in the first leg of their 
Capital One Cup semi-final on Wednesday night.

Allardyce is under increasing pressure after travelling fans turned on the manager at the Etihad Stadium.
