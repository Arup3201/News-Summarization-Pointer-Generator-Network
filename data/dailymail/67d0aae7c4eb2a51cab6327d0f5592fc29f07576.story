Ever fancy seeing the inside of a police station?

The sell-off of hundreds of Metropolitan Police properties could mean househunters could buy their own corner of a former station in a sought-after area.

In a move that has angered people across London, hundreds of police stations are being sold off as part of plans to reduce running costs across the capital.

Up for sale: Whetstone Police Station in the London Borough of Barnet - complete with sign saying it is available

Winchmore Hill police station in Enfield north London could be flats or offices

Pricey: Hackney police station in east London is said to be worth about £3million

The front counter of East Ham police station closed in June and the building is now up for sale

After deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh announced his proposals to get officers out of the offices and onto the streets last March, the for sale signs have gone up on several historic buildings in London.

According to homesandproperty.co.uk, hundreds could be sold to make room for 3,000 homes in some of the most prestigious postcodes in the capital.

Among the buildings the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime have put up for sale, is St John's Wood police station which is near to Regent's Park in north west London.

But the most high-profile closure is New Scotland Yard.

Highgate Police Station closed in 1998 and is currently home to the Haringey Child Abuse Investigation Team

Wanstead Police Station has been declared as unfit for purpose for modern policing by the Metropolitan Police's Borough Commander

Sought-after location: Muswell Hill police station is at the junction of Fortis Greena and Fortis Green Avenue

It was announced in May that the 
former Whitehall police station on Victoria Embankment - known as the 
Curtis Green Building and owned by the Mayor's Office for Policing and 
Crime (MOPAC) - will become 'Scotland Yard', the Met's new headquarters 
in 2015 and will host the famous revolving sign.

MOPAC
 says the cost of the MPS remaining in New Scotland Yard would run into 
the tens of millions of pounds, with £50million needed to bring the 
outdated facilities up to date and annual running costs of £11million.

The Curtis Green site has been empty for two years and is in the heart of Westminster.

About 300,000 square metres (one third) of MOPAC's estate will be sold over the next three years.

Leyton police station has been empty for more than three years and squatters had moved in

Sell-off: Golders Green police station in Temple Fortune has a car park and outbuildings at the back

This will save £85million a year on 
running costs by 2015/16 (compared with 2009) and £60 million will be 
reinvested in the estate and infrastructure to support the frontline and
 help keep officer numbers high.

The
 plan announced by the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Stephen 
Greenhalgh and the Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey will also provide up
 to 950 modern cells to help reduce the time it takes to process people 
in custody and the sale of up to 200 buildings - the vast majority of 
which have no public access.

Deputy
 Mayor for Policing and Crime, Stephen Greenhalgh said: 'Selling off 
underutilised and unoccupied buildings will cut the running costs of the
 Met's estate by £60 million, which will pay for 1200 extra police 
officers across London's boroughs over the next three years.

'This strategy should generate at least £300 million, which will be ploughed back into the remaining buildings so that a run down, largely Victorian police estate is fit for the 21st century.'

Plans to close Tottenham police station faced strong opposition and protests from residents in north London

Deputy Commissioner of the MPS, Craig 
Mackey, said: 'This is the most significant transformation of the police
 estate in the history of the MPS.

Under the hammer: Golders Green police station

'The changes proposed will help us to 
save on running costs and sell properties that are no longer required, 
allowing us to invest in modern facilities that are fit for our 
officers, staff and the public.'

The estate is vast and expensive, with almost 500 buildings, costing £203 million a year to run.

The
 strategy covers the entire MOPAC estate including police stations, 
forensic labs, firing ranges, training grounds, horse and dog centres, 
offices and custody facilities.

A spokesman for the Met Police said: 'We want to deliver a more efficient and higher quality estate which meets the operational needs of the MPS and costs less to run.

'The police estate dates back to 1847 
(St John's Wood police station). We won't keep older buildings any 
longer than we need to - some buildings are getting old and the cost of 
keeping and maintaining them is considerable.

'Reduce the amount of space occupied by 300,000 sq m by 2015/16 and reduce estate running costs to £140 m per year. Estate running costs have already reduced from £225m per year (April 2009) to £205m by March 2013.

'We
 will provide up to 950 modern cells - better facilities and will 
support a reduction in time it takes for a detainee in custody to be 
processed. This also means victims will no longer enter or use the same 
door as alleged perpetrators.

'We
 know our estate is under used - analysis has shown that over 40 per 
cent of desks are unoccupied at any given time. A key aspect of our 
approach is making sure our buildings are used more efficiently.

'We will continue to invest in those buildings core to operational policing needs.'
