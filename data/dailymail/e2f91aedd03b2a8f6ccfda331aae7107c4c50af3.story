The search for missing teenager Sierra LaMar continued underwater today after sonar images revealed suspicious-looking objects in a local reservoir.

Sierra was reported missing by her
mother on March 16 after she failed to turn up to her bus stop or high school in Morgan Hill,
California.

The 15-year-old's cellphone was found near the side of the road the next day and her Juicy brand black and pink purse with clothes folded neatly inside was found the day after that.

Mystery: Sierra disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop March 16 in Morgan Hill, California

Earlier this week, investigators from the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office used sonar technology at the Chesbro reservoir and found five areas of concern, according to KTVU-TV.

'Based on the size and shape and shadowing that we're seeing from the side scan sonar, we'd just like to go back and take a second look at them,' Santa Clara County sheriff's Lt. Dan Rodriguez told the channel. 'They are larger than normal objects.'

Because of the murky and dangerous conditions, and two feet of visibility, divers had to be strapped to police on land by rope.

Divers, who went as deep as 60-feet, were also searching the nearby Uvas Reservoir in Santa Clara County today.

So far detectives have uncovered a golf ball and a flipper but there has been no sign of Sierra, although her family is refusing to give up hope.

The parents of the missing teen are offering a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her.

The 15-year-old's mother Marlene, father
Steve and sister Danielle have also set up a website dedicated to 
finding the cheerleader.

Mrs LaMar told ABC7 news that her daughter's disappearance was weighing heavily on her.

'As each day goes on it's agonising,' she said. 'I'm definitely suffering sleep deprivation but I need to focus on the belief that Sierra is going to come forward.'

Police believe Sierra has been 
kidnapped as she does not have a history of running away and no family 
problems. Interviews with friends and a search
of her computer also yielded no information indicating she had fled.

Her disappearance has sparked an outpouring of support from the local community and received nation-wide press coverage.

Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has also joined the search.

Reward: Marlene LaMar, the mother of missing teenager Sierra LaMar, appealed for her safe return as the family offered a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her

Donations: Sierra's family has scraped the $10,000 reward money together through fundraising and donations, the teen's father Steve said

Speaking
at a press conference over Easter weekend, Mr LaMar, a computer 
engineer at a
tech startup in Sunnyvale, expressed his gratitude at the overwhelming 
support the family had received from local residents. 'Everyone's been 
so generous,' he said.

Yesterday 
the family launched the Help Us Find Sierra LaMar website, which 
describes Sierra as a 'confident teenager who stands up for not only 
herself but others as well'.

It also hosts a gallery of pictures and allows friends 
to post messages to Sierra.

'The world has seemed so out of 
balance since you’ve been gone,' wrote Jenna Wondka. 'I’m missing you 
more and more every day, you never leave my mind. You’re too young and 
innocent for this to be happening. You’ve always been there for me and 
I’ll always be here for you until you’re found and anytime after that.'

The family is also accepting donations via the site. They have raised the $10,000 reward money through fundraising and donations, Mr LaMar said.

'We're hoping it might give someone the 
motivation to come forward,' he said. 'We're desperate for anything that
can bring her home to us.'

Poignant: Posters have been taped up near to where Sierra went missing, as her family hope for more clues

Search: Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area

Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map

So far the search has turned up an 
empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms, found by a search volunteer 
within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's phone and purse were found, days after she disappeared.

Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police, or it could be a simple coincidence.

Authorities
have investigated more than 1,200 tip and clocked around 7,500 hours on
the case. They said they would be broadening the search this week.

'The sheriff’s office will be 
sending out deputies on motor dirt bikes later this week to canvass 
remote/rural areas in south Santa Clara County areas,' Sgt Jose 
Cardoza, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Office of the Sheriff, told the Huffington Post.

If Sierra has been killed, her body is likely to be above ground, Sgt Cardoza said. 'Someone like that is not 
going to dig a grave,' he said. 'He drove her out someplace and the body
will likely be in a ditch or (easily accessible) location.'

He added her abductor could be a serial rapist or perhaps even a serial killer and a person likely familiar with the local area.

School: Last week, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends

Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scent at her mother's driveway Sierra's cell phone was recovered in a field nearby the day after her disappearance

Growing concern: Sierra's purse containing neatly folded clothes was also found two days after her disappearance

The law enforcement response has 
included searching the homes of neighbors, contacting registered sex 
offenders, interviewing friends and relatives, and stopping drivers who 
travel the road where Sierra picked up the bus and where her phone and 
purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual.

Sierra is 5-feet-2 with a thin build, dark hair and an olive complexion.

Anyone with 
information on Sierra’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Santa Clara 
County Sheriff at (408) 808-4500 or (408) 299-2311; to remain anonymous,
call the tip line at (408) 808-4311. Tips can also be emailed to
