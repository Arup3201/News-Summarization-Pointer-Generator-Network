A mother-of-three calmly returned to her care home job moments after learning she had scooped nearly £7 million on the lottery.

Paul Lawton, 56, called his wife home from work to help him double check  their winning numbers.

But rather than starting the celebrations straight away Deborah Lawton, 49, went back to work to finish her shift, despite being £6.9m better off.

The couple now plan to spend the money on making their family secure and providing a better home for their eldest daughter Tracey, who has cerebral palsy.

Long distance lorry driver Mr Lawton was out on the road when he stopped to pick up some food and the lottery ticket. 

But it was not until Sunday morning after he had helped Tracey, get dressed that he got round to checking his numbers.

He said: 'One...two...oh, I've matched three numbers,' I thought. Then four, five and six matched too, so I checked them again, then I double-checked the date, and then I think I sat down in the armchair.

'I'm generally quite a calm person so didn't get too excited at this point but instead called Deborah at work and asked her to come home for 10 minutes.'

After Mrs Lawton had checked the numbers and returned to work, she called younger daughters Nicola and Deborah to ask them around later that afternoon.

She said: 'I rang them to say we had some good news and could they pop round with their other halves. They arrived at 3pm sharp and Paul and I simply said 'We've won almost £7 million on the Lotto'.

'They all went pale and looked like they were going to pass out, then started shaking and shrieking with excitement. Tracey doesn't speak, but she just looked at us all like we had lost our minds - it was priceless.

'At that point we thought it was time to celebrate, so we cracked open the beers and had a little party, just the family together. It was a very special evening.' 

Mr Lawton of Withernsea near Hull, is now planning to start searching for a new home. 

'We live in a house that has been modified with Tracey's needs in mind but this win means that we can now search for a lovely big bungalow that can be fitted out properly,' he said.

The couple are now planing to spend their millions making sure their family are safe and secure

'It will enrich her life so much and that's the most important thing on the agenda. Then we can look after Nicola and her husband and our wonderful three grandchildren, along with Deborah and her partner, who are expecting their first baby later this year. 

'We're very normal people and will remain so, but it makes me feel very happy inside to know that those I love most will be helped by this incredible stroke of good fortune.'
