Women with ovarian cancer are in ‘critical danger’ of missing out on life-saving treatment because the NHS does not offer them genetic testing, say campaigners.

One in five women with non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, which accounts for 70 per cent of all cases, are believed to carry the BRCA 1 or 2 mutation, dramatically increasing their risk of developing the disease.

The mutation indicates a form of cancer that responds better to drugs known as PARP inhibitors.

Women with ovarian cancer are in 'critical danger' of missing out on life-saving treatment because the NHS does not offer genetic testing

In a report today, the charity Ovarian Cancer Action calls for all women diagnosed with this kind of ovarian cancer to be offered screening for the faulty BRCA genes at the point of diagnosis so they can get the appropriate treatment. Genetic testing is the only way to determine whether a woman will benefit from PARP drugs.

At the moment, screening is ‘patchy and dependent on where a patient lives’, warns the charity.

Dr Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami, senior lecturer and honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Hammersmith Hospital in London, says: ‘PARP inhibitors are more effective at killing cancer cells and shrinking tumours in patients with BRCA 1/2 than those without.

‘They are particularly important for BRCA1/2 patients who have a recurrence of ovarian cancer, and for whom there might not be many options.’

Angelina Jolie, whose mother died of ovarian cancer, underwent a double mastectomy last year after she discovered that she had the BRCA1 gene

Screening also impacts on future disease risk – patients with the gene are far more likely to develop breast cancer further down the line.

Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year.

It is the fifth most common cancer among women.

It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age.

The symptoms are difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease, as they can be very similar to those of other, less serious, conditions.

The most common early symptoms are persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating and nausea.

Other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently.

Actress Angelina Jolie underwent a double mastectomy last year after discovering she carried the BRCA1 gene. Her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died aged 56 from ovarian cancer.

BRCA gene mutations mean that patients have between a 40 and 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian tumours, compared with just two per cent in women without the mutation. They also have a 60 and 90 per cent chance of developing tumours in the breast that are difficult to treat.

Although exact figures are unknown, Dr Ghaem-Maghami says it’s possible that women who have survived ovarian cancer could later develop breast cancer because they did not know about the mutation.

‘If a woman with ovarian cancer knows she has the BRCA 1 or 2 gene she is able to tell her sisters or daughters to get tested, so it’s a really important part of a cancer prevention strategy,’ she adds.

Ovarian cancer patients in Scotland are automatically given the option to be tested for BRCA 1/2 after diagnosis, but in the rest of the UK screening is only given to those being treated at hospitals where clinical trials are taking place. These have included trials for PARP inhibitors which are expected to be licensed for general use next spring.
