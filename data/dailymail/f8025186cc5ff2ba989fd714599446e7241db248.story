Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has another scandal on his hands after Toronto police arrested two men who appear to be associates of his.

In a series of pre-dawn raids on Thursday, Toronto police rounded up many of the city's underworld, including Muhammad Khattak and Monir Kassim.

It's Khattak and Kassim that Ford has his arms around in a photograph that was provided by an anonymous tipster.

The photograph was released by Gawker in May. According to the site's editors, a video
featuring Ford smoking crack cocaine was taken at a house in Etobicoke,
Toronto and the photo is evidence of it.

The Star reports that the third man in the photograph was Anthony Smith, a gang member allegedly shot and killed in downtown Toronto in March. Kassim was charged with trafficking drugs and weapons, and Khattak with drug trafficking in the raids.

The house where the video was allegedly taken, 15 Windsor Road in Etobicoke, wasn't one of the properties raided in the operation, codenamed Project Traveller, but neighbors told The Star that the police are frequent callers at the property.

In the year-long Project Traveller operation, police have seized 40 guns, CAN$3 million worth of drugs and CAN$572,000 in cash.

Known to police: The house at 15 Windsor Rd, Etobicoke where Mayor Ford was allegedly videoed smoking crack cocaine

In a press conference on Thursday after the raids, Toronto's police chief Bill Blair was grilled by reporters about the alleged video of Mayor Ford smoking crack cocaine and whether any evidence was found against him, but refused to discuss the mayor.

'I am not at liberty to disclose any evidence,' Blair said, adding that all evidence would come out in court.

Of the photo of Ford and the three gang members, Blair told CBC radio, 'The photo is real and we know who the individuals are in that photo.'

Denial: Rob Ford denies the existence of the video of him smoking crack and says he has nothing to hide

Gossip: Mayor Rob Ford, pictured with his wife, second from left, and friends, has had a scandal-ridden term as mayor of Toronto

Mayor Ford told reporters on Friday that he has nothing to hide. According to The Star, he said, 'You guys can’t get it through your thick skulls. I’ve already answered all these questions. I have nothing to do with this.'

The Star reports that in a council meeting Councillor Josh Matlow questioned why Ford was photographed outside a suspected drug house with a man who was later shot.'There is still a dark cloud hanging over city hall and at the heart of it is the mayor,' Matlow said. 'I think it would be helpful to city council, residents and the mayor himself if he would respond fully and honestly to questions, so we can clear the air and move forward...'When the mayor suggests that he has answered all the questions posed to him, we know that to be factually untrue. We all know there have been honest questions put to him and he has not replied with honest answers yet.'
