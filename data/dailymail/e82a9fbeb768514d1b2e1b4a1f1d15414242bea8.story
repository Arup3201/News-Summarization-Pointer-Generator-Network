Maria Sharapova deployed her famous competitive fire to fight back from a set down and beat Sam Stosur to reach the quarter-finals at the French Open.

At a set and 3-4 down, it looked like the tournament might be about to lose another star name, but Sharapova did not drop another game in a 3-6, 6-4 ,6-0 victory.

The Russian title favourite said: 'I treat my career and my work as a very serious profession, and I know that what has got me my success is the fact that I'm a big competitor and that I don't want to give anyone a chance.

One step closer: Maria Sharapova fought back from a set down to beat Sam Stosur and reach the last eight

'I was never here from day one to make friendships. This is a battlefield for me, and I want to win.

'I
 think you see that passion when I'm on the court. That's my job. That's
 how I feel. I try to tough it out. I try to grind it out, whatever it 
takes. Sometimes it's not very pretty, but at the end of the day, if I 
get the job done, I'm happy.'

Stosur
 was playing with five stitches in her leg after a gym accident and the 
match would have been considered a closer call but for Sharapova's 13-2 
lead in matches between the two.

It
 did not look that way in the opening set, however, as Stosur dominated 
with her kick serve and forehand and Sharapova was left scrambling 
around behind the baseline.

She
 broke serve at the start of the second set but, after receiving a time 
violation, gave it back three games later, and it was Sharapova who was 
looking under the most pressure.

But,
 her US Open victory in 2011 as an honourable aside, Stosur has 
frequently cracked under pressure, and it was the same again.

Serving
 at 4-4 she played a terrible game, Sharapova held to take the set and 
then made it nine straight games to clinch victory.

Sharapova
 would have expected to face Serena Williams in the last eight but 
instead it will be the world number one's conqueror, Garbine Muguruza.

The
 Spaniard has built on her stunning second-round win impressively and 
ended the run of wild card Pauline Parmentier with a 6-4, 6-2 victory.
