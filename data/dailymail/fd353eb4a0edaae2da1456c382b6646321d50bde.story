The Oakland Raiders arrived in England battling jetlag and chasing a first win of the season.

But that isn’t all, as they plan to make England their home for the remainder of the week.

With a depleted linebacking corps and a worrying inability to score touchdowns, Dennis Allen’s side are certainly down, but not necessarily out.

And as the bleary-eyed squad familiarise themselves with their sumptuous Surrey surrounds, the Raiders finished their first practice on English soil in high spirits ahead of their ‘home’ game with the Miami Dolphins at Wembley on Sunday.

‘I thought practice was pretty good,’ said head coach Allen.

‘Obviously we got here Monday morning and the guys had a little bit of time on Monday and Tuesday to catch up on a little bit of rest. Now we’ll get started with a normal game week preparation. 

'I think the further we go into the week, the more acclimated the guys will get to the time change and hopefully that won’t be any sort of factor come Sunday.’

After arriving in these shores on Monday morning, quarterback Derek Carr spoke of the oddities of the international series.

‘It’s crazy. I texted my wife this morning and she was still on Tuesday. I was texting her goodnight and she said “good morning”. It was weird. At the same time, the first day I got here, I tried to fight sleep as long as I could. I think I slept for like 11 hours that first day because I was trying to get caught up to this time zone. 

'Obviously, still feeling it a little bit today. As the days have gone, it’s gotten progressively better. The faster I can get into the right time zone, which is here, the better it will feel. I’m glad we came out as early as we did because it definitely makes a difference.’

Devoid of two starters - wide receiver Rod Streater and safety Tyvon Branch suffered foot injuries during the agonising 16-9 defeat at New England - the Raiders know they need to win. And fast.

‘That’s all I care about,’ said rookie quarterback Carr.

‘I’ve told you guys that I’ll throw five touchdowns or five picks, I could care less. I just want to win. That’s all this game is about. That’s all that matters in the NFL. I learned that quick.

‘As we saw last week, we score a touchdown, it gets taken away. We’re going in there, who knows what could have happened after that. It’s just that much. You learn how hard it is to win in this league and you learn how hard it is to get that first one.

'That’s what I’m learning right now, how much it really takes to get one win, let alone 16, something that New England has done before. Hopefully we’ll get it this week. I don’t make any promises, I can tell you that.’

And Carr spoke in glowing terms of the explosive Cameron Wake.

‘I can go on and on on their whole defense. They have so much talent. Cameron Wake is obviously a great player. You have to know… when you turn the film on, you’re like “oh my goodness, who is 91?” It’s one of those guys. You’ve got to know where he’s at at all times.’

Meanwhile Khalil Mack, the fifth overall pick of May’s draft, was succinct about the Raiders’ fortunes so far.

Asked to summarise his tender three-game NFL career, he replied: ‘Gotta get better, gotta get better, gotta get better.’

Like many, this is the linebacker’s first trip to England, with the 22-year-old replying: ‘It’s great. It’s different. I’m glad to be here and it’s a different experience for me. I’m glad to be blessed to have this opportunity.’

They face an inconsistent Dolphins side, who have a rookie offensive line and concerns about Ryan Tannehill at quarterback. But their defense is a force to be reckoned with, as Allen alluded to.

‘It’s a good football team. Defensively, they’re fast. They’re aggressive. They do some different things. They like to pressure the quarterback. 

'They’ve done a great job of getting pressure on the quarterback so we’ve got to understand what they’re trying to do. Their front four is outstanding as far as getting pressure on the quarterback. We’ve got to take care of the front four.’
