A heroic jogger sprang into action to free a mouflon trapped to a tree by its horns.

Filmed in Poland, the video captures Krystof Wlodarczyk out on his morning run through the woods near Konin.

He encounters the animal – a subspecies group of the wild sheep – struggling to free itself from a small branch.

In the video the animal can be seen charging in a circle in its desperate attempts to free itself before resting for a moment and trying again.

The video maker and Mr Wlodarczyk can be heard talking and contemplating what to do as the jogger cautiously approaches the wild animal.

Reacting to the man’s presence, the mouflon begins lowering its head and struggling harder against the tree.

Mr Wlodarczyk then leans out to  hold onto the top of the branch and begins breaking it, while keeping a safe distance from the distressed animal.

Snapping the branch in two, the jogger now has something to hold on to, and in between dodging the animal’s charging horns, attempts to free it from the branch.

After more struggling, Mr Wlodarczyk finally has a grip on the mouflon’s horn and begins prising it from the branch.

But the panicked animal makes the job harder by continuing to fight against the man by running in a circle.

Eventually however the man is able to get a firm grip and pulls the animals bowed head from the tree.

He then shouts ‘yes’ in celebration as the freed animal runs off in the opposite direction.

Discussing the incident, Mr Wlodarczyk said: ‘I was not afraid, I've seen it often here in the forest.

‘This is the first time I encountered one at such a short distance. The poor thing was desperately trying to break free. It wasn't easy but I was glad I could get it out of there.’

He added: ‘He [the mouflon] stopped on a hill, and we measured for a few seconds, amazing. I think it was its way of saying thank you.’

Success! Krystof Wlodarczyk throws his hands up in the air and shouts 'yes' as the animal is freed
