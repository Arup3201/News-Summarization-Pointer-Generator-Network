A group of Morris Dancers were ordered to stop performing in the middle of a routine after police received a complaint that their dancing was ‘offensive’.

The 15-strong group of English folk dancers from the respected Wild Hunt Bedlam Morris troupe were told to ‘stop making a din’ during a performance outside The White Lion pub in Warlingham, Surrey.

The folk dancers were performing in spooky costumes for a free Halloween show outside the 15th century pub to an audience of around 30 customers, but were cut short after just six dances.

The group had planned at least 10 other dances, but were interrupted by two police officers who told them to ‘down’ their sticks and ‘move on’ as they were causing a noise nuisance.

Despite pleading with the officers to continue their routine - which includes songs like Thor’s Hammer, Maiden Castle and Half a Farthing Candle, they were told to leave in the ‘interest of community relations’ last Tuesday.

Morris dancer David Young, who has been dancing with the troupe for the past seven years, said he was disgusted that folk dancers were treated ‘like yobs’.

The 69-year-old said: 'We did six dances and then, at about 9pm, we went in to have a drink before going back out to perform again.

'The next thing we know, two policemen arrived. They said, in the interest of "community relations", we think you should stop dancing.'

He told the Croydon Advertiser newspaper: 'You would think the police would have let us carry on.

'It’s the first time we’ve encountered anything like it.

'We felt treated like yobs. But we’ve got ex-oil executives, business owners and a school secretary in our group.

'We just feel aggrieved that something that has such a long history in the country, at a time when it is hard to keep the old traditions alive, should not be allowed.'

The respected troupe, which perform in masks and flamboyant costumes, celebrated its 21st anniversary earlier this year at the Tower of London, where the ancient Ceremony of the Keys - a 700-year-old tradition in which the tower is locked up for the night - takes place.

Martin Saunders, 54, who was watching the dancing last Tuesday, said he was ‘appalled’ when they were ordered to stop.

He said: 'The police came along while the Morris dancers were on a break and told them to move on as they were upsetting neighbours with their offensive dance routine.

'The police officers were a little shame-faced about it all, but really they should have just ignored it and let the dancing continue - it was only just after 9pm.'

'Aggrieved': Members of the troupe were told to stop shortly after 9pm following a complaint from a neighbour

One pub worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police came because they got a complaint from a neighbour.

'I think everyone was a bit surprised really. Morris dancers have been dancing around in the area for years.'

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'We received a report from a member of the public about noisy revellers outside the White Lion pub in Warlingham.

'A neighbourhood police officer attended and spoke to a group.

'The noise had already stopped and no formal allegations were made and the group left the area without incident.'

In August last year a group of Morris dancers from the Slubbing Billys troupe were booted out of the Swan and Three Cygnets pub in Durham after a barmaid said the bells on their shoes broke the bar’s music ban.
