A North Texas woman has been handcuffed, strip-searched and booked into jail - because of an overdue driving ticket.

Sarah Boaz was issued a ticket in Richland Hills after an officer saw her drive through a stop sign in August. Boaz lost the ticket and imagined that the worst consequence would be a late fee.

Instead, she was arrested outside her home as she left for work Wednesday morning.

Jailed for a ticket: Sarah Boaz never made it to work Wednesday morning after she was arrested outside her home for an unpaid ticket

A Richland Hills city marshal was waiting for her as she walked out her front door.

'No one puts out a bench warrant after 60 days,' she told CBS 11. 'Why would you do that?'

Boaz was handcuffed and taken to the jail. She listened in disbelief as a female officer instructed her to undress.

Disbelief: It wasn't until a female officer instructed Boaz to strip that she realized she was going to prison

Richland Hills is a small town that has only one marshal, meaning warrants for unpaid tickets get processed more quickly than they would in a larger city. 

However, Attorney Jason Smith told CBS 11, there’s nothing requiring the city to put people in jail.

'The constitution doesn’t keep the government or government officials from using common sense,' he said.

'Unfortunately, some police officers, some governments get overly aggressive because they want that ticket revenue.'

Overzealous: Richland Hills officials insist Boaz was sent notices in the mail about her unpaid fine

Boaz was in jail only a short time before her family came to bail her out.

She told CBS 11 she expected to at least receive a notice in the mail before such extreme action.

Richland Municipal Court officials said notices had been sent to Boaz.

CBS 11 reports that shortly after Boaz was freed from prison, her husband received a ticket - for rolling through a stop sign.
