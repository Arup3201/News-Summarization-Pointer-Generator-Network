Anthony Joshua refused to accept a charity bet with Kevin Johnson as the two heavyweights squared off ahead of their clash in the new year.

The American, who has never been stopped in his 36-fight career, offered to donate 50 per cent of his purse to a cause of Joshua’s choice if he knocked him out.

But the Olympic champion was reluctant to agree to the deal during an entertaining press conference.

The pair will touch gloves at the O2 in London on January 31 in what promises to be Joshua’s toughest test to date.

Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the distance in their world title fight in 2009 and both Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury have subsequently failed to stop him.

Johnson said: 'I want to make an agreement with him. If Anthony knocks me out I'll donate 50 per cent of my purse to one of his charities. 

'And if he gets knocked out, he gives 50 per cent to my charity.

'There's going to be a knockout so let's up the ante.'

Joshua, however, said: 'I don't play with my money.'

Johnson was unmoved and added: 'If you get me within five, I'll donate 75 per cent.'

But Joshua retorted: 'He's a better comedian then he is a boxer.'

Johnson, 35, talked a good game on his visit to the capital on Wednesday, despite having lost his last three fights.

He said: 'All I asked for is a fight with reasonable time and that's what [promoter] Eddie Hearn came up with.

'This guy gave me proper preparation time which no-one has ever given me in my whole career.

'I look forward to coming, seeing, destroying and conquering.

'In my career, I've fought four Olympians and every last one of them has made the same mistake.

'It's up to his trainers to fix it. I look forward to doing what I do best which is destroying Olympians. 

Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the full 12 rounds in their heavyweight world title fight in 2009

Johnson also fought Tyson Fury who also failed to stop the veteran in a title eliminator in Belfast two years ago

Dereck Chisora found Johnson's defensive skills too difficult to penetrate and had to settle for a points win

'This fight is everything to me; this could be the beginning or it could be the end.

'It reminds me of a young lion against an older lion. If this young lion really wants the spot, he's going to come real hard but if this lion doesn't want to give up his herd, he's going to fight even harder.'

Joshua responded: 'The fight's not going to last as long as his talking!

'I've got a lot of respect for Kevin Johnson. He's not Michael Sprott, he's not Matt Skelton, he's not Denis Bakhtov.

'I'm a man with a lot of hunger and I'm willing to gain experience by fighting guys like Johnson.

'I know I'm going to get the win and I'm very confident.'
