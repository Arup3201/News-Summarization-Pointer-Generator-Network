Jack Rodwell looks like a footballer, he talks like a footballer — albeit an erudite and engaging one — and his CV would suggest he is a very good footballer.

He is 23 years old, has been capped by England at every level, has a Premier League winners medal and a total of £22million invested in him by Manchester City and then, earlier this month, Sunderland.

But for more than two years — since swapping Everton for the Etihad —Rodwell was not a footballer, and upon reintroduction to his profession at West Brom it showed.

Off the pace: Jack Rodwell struggled on his Sunderland debut in the 2-2 draw at West Brom last weekend, but his manager Gus Poyet has backed him to rediscover his best form following his move from Manchester City

Ready for action: Rodwell will likely line up for Sunderland against Manchester United on Sunday

No Premier League debutant scored a lower Sportsmail merit mark than Rodwell’s ‘5’ in the 2-2 draw.

This, of course, comes with an almighty caveat, for Rodwell had not started a league game for 11 months.

It should sound as a cautionary tale for youngsters lured to the likes of City, for no matter his talk of ‘learning curves’ and ‘no regrets’, here is a player who has stood still in the stands.

At The Hawthorns a week ago he looked lost, as if he had forgotten how to perform on such a stage, unable to showcase his ability.

The accelerated evolution of the Premier League, of course, means players are quicker, stronger and fitter than even two years ago — Rodwell has some catching-up to do.

Forgotten man: Rodwell was starved of game time during his two seasons at Manchester City

Faith: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet believes Rodwell will come good with more time on the pitch

International return? Rodwell is targeting more appearances for England

In the days before the game he had sat with journalists and confidently held court, bullishly declaring he was good enough to play for England in central midfield or defence.

His subsequent effort on the field, however, made his words seem premature.

For now, Gus Poyet is protecting the £10m man. ‘This week he has been much better (in training),’ said the Uruguayan, who subbed Rodwell in the second half.

‘In the first half, we didn’t help him. He couldn’t get into the game. I took him off when he was starting to influence the game, you can blame me.’

Gary Bennett — the former Sunderland captain who came through the ranks at Manchester City — agrees.

‘Jack will only get better,’ he said. ‘He will come good. He has not played for a long time and it will take a little while for his timing and fitness to improve.

‘But he is young. I know people say he has wasted two years, but he would have learnt a lot at City and he comes here hungry. We just have to be patient.’

This is the year Rodwell must start playing like the footballer we all hoped he would become.
