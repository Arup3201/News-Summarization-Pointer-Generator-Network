Jason Britcher, 40, pictured outside of court was alleged to have attempted to rape a woman barrister at a Christmas party

A barristers' legal clerk attempted to rape a junior woman lawyer after a solicitors' Christmas party, a court heard. 

Married Jason Britcher, 40, crept in to the sleeping woman's hotel room after texting her at 3am to ask where she was.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not initially alarmed and mistook the father-of-one for her husband.

As she began to wake up she discovered that it was Britcher and she was assaulted twice, Hull Crown Court heard.

Britcher later claimed he had stumbled into her room through an interconnecting hotel door, as he was looking for the bathroom.

He said the woman consented to what went on. 

A second woman has also complained that she too had been assaulted by Britcher, but  five years earlier than the attack on the barrister.

Britcher, who has a teenage daughter, denied to one charge of rape, two charges of sexual assault and one charge of attempted rape, on two separate women.

In the more recent incident the jury was told the pair had gone independently to the party for solicitors and barristers in the south  of the country.

'It was a typical Christmas party in which people would drink, dance and socialize,' said Mr Thackray.

He explained the victim booked a room at a nearby hotel because she did not live locally.

Britcher had the room next door. 

He sent her a text at 3.44am saying: 'Sorting a little room. Are you guys in main building, or pleb X.'

She did not reply. He sent her room-mate a text offering his bed while he slept on the floor. Neither woman replied. 

'You may wonder what was going through his mind at this time. Was he about to crash out and fall asleep or was he wanting some company?' said Mr Thackray.

'There was no intimacy between them whatsoever, nor had there been any intimacy between them on a prior occasion.

'He said at around 3am the woman returned to her hotel room. He said unfortunately she did not lock the door, as she had offered a spare bed to friend also at the party to avoid a lengthy journey home.

'She went to sleep still wearing her dress,' said Mr Thackray. 'She thought her friend was returning share her bed and didn't want to be naked.'

'Her next recollection was of someone being next to her, cuddling up to her. She was still half asleep and she thought it was her husband who was in bed with her. 

'She wasn't immediately alarmed. She felt the person she thought was her husband touching her. 

'At this point the complainant still believed that it was her husband behind her, and she reached around to assist, what she thought was her husband.' He said Britcher was attempting to rape her.

'It was at that point that alarm bells started to ring.' He said Britcher then committed a further sexual assault.

'That woke her up completely and she opened her eyes. She turned her head and saw it was the defendant. She told him to f**** off. She said he looked shocked and left quickly.'

Mr Thackray said after Britcher left, the woman was in a state of distress.

She could not face speaking to her husband, so called her sister in tears, saying she had woken up to find a man on top of her.

'She did not immediately call the police,' said Mr Thackray. The woman then rang a member of her chambers as others were still socializing at the party.

The police were then informed by a solicitor and arrived at the hotel to arrest Britcher whose fingerprints, DNA, and photograph was taken. 

He said cocaine was found in Britcher's body in a concentration consistent with him having taken it during the evening.

The earlier victim told police Britcher indecently assaulted told her after she got into bed and went to sleep following a party. On the occasion she told him to get off her.

The woman, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said there was a second incident a year later when he raped her. 

In police interview, Britcher denied the first sexual assault with the first woman had taken place and said the second incident he accepted sex took place, but said it was consensual.

Crown barrister John Thackray said: 'It is the prosecutions case that whilst under the influence of alcohol, and on one occasion cocaine, on three separate occasions, the defendant has committed sexual acts in the clear and obvious knowledge that both women were not consenting.

'These are two entirely unconnected complainants, who have each made remarkably similar allegations against the same man, in complete ignorance of the other's allegations.'  

The trial continues.
