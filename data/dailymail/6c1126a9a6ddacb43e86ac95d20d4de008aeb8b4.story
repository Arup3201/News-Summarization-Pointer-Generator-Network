'Visit Barnsley', which has almost 3,000 followers, describes the former mining town as a 'godless den of filth' in a parody of the original council-run account

A spoof twitter account has come under fire for mocking a Yorkshire town - branding it the 'pound shop capital of the north' and the 'birthplace of dogging'.

'Visit Barnsley', which has almost 3,000 followers, describes the former mining town as a 'godless den of filth' in a parody of the original council-run account.

Using the hashtag #BarnsleyIsBrill, the account highlights the town's amenities such as botched tanning salons and a market which sells cheap knock-off goods.

One photograph shows a woman smothered in fake tan with the caption: 'Planning an expensive holiday this year? Why not save a fortune and visit Barnsley suntan guaranteed #barnsleyisbrill.'

Another post shows a rundown street with a row of derelict shops and flats, with the message: 'Want US to promote your business? Just drop us line. Look how we've helped businesses in other areas.'

The founder of the account, who lives in nearby Wakefield and wished to remain anonymous, said he set it up because many people think of Barnsley as being a 'rough' town in the 'grim north'.

'I'm from Wakefield but I'm in Barnsley every other weekend, I've nothing against Barnsley let's get that out of the way,' he said.

'As to why I set it up. Most people think of Barnsley as being a bit rough, an ex-mining town up in the grim north. So give them what they want to hear.'

'I do have quite a few more considerably bigger accounts too.'

In the bio for the spoof account, the description says: 'Visit Barnsley, Pound Shop Capital Of The North, You Won't Be Not Disappointed. Why Not Let Us Promote Your Business?'

One photograph shows a knock-off Playstation called 'Polystation', with a caption saying: 'Visit Barnsley market with over 300 stalls selling top quality merchandise. Pick up a £Bargin [sic]'.

The Twitter account has come under fire for making a mockery of the town, which is well-known for its mining history as the former leader of the miners' union, Arthur Scargill, was born there.

Cllr Roy Miller, Cabinet spokesperson for Places, said: 'We are fully behind free speech but are dismayed that someone would anonymously seek to actively post negative and offensive material in the name of Visit Barnsley. However, many organisations and individuals have copycat accounts, which don't pose a serious threat. 

'The council and its partners in the business community are working hard to promote Barnsley; we have focussed on making sure our official account @VisitBarnsley is full of positive news, supported by our other social media accounts which give details of what's taking place across the borough.' 

Councillor Betty Barlow said: 'It's a very busy prosperous town. I don't know why they would say those things about the town, it does not paint the town in a good light.

'It is a great tourism destination. There are a lot of open air spaces, lots of museums, lovely attractions, such as Cannon Hall. And a lot of places you can visit for free which you don't get everywhere.'
