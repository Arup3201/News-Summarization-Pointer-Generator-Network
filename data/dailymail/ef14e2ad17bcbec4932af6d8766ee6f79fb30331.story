Behind the scenes at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal’s new team is rapidly coming together. Time is short and his vision is critical.

There will be a big shift in English football next season, with talk of Van Gaal’s formations at United dominating the storyline in the Barclays Premier League. It is an exciting new era for the game.

During Holland’s march to the World Cup quarter-final, where they will play Costa Rica, his mind has been whirring away with thoughts about his first season at Old Trafford.

Numbers game: Van Gaal issues tactical instructions from the touchline during Holland's win over Mexico

Watching Holland at this World Cup, it is clear that United have employed a coach who operates with conviction.

When he makes changes, as he did when he replaced golden boy Robin van Persie with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar against Mexico, he expects a positive impact. So far at this tournament it has worked.

Van Gaal has been studying United’s personnel and he is tempted to make a radical switch to 3-4-3. If he does, it will be a bold move.

The idea of a sweeper, a libero at the heart of the defence, has never sat easily with English football.

Steve McClaren was the last man to play it with the national team, against Croatia in a Euro 2008 qualifier in Zagreb and it was an unmitigated disaster. It has rarely been seen since.

Very few English teams, with the exception of Glenn Hoddle at Swindon and Chelsea, have been able to work out a way of successfully playing the system.

When Van Gaal trials this formation later this month during United’s pre-season tour to the United States, the new coach intends to broaden the minds of his players.

He wants them to become fascinated with tactics and the evolution of a game as it progresses in real time.

As Zlatan Ibrahimovic notes in his brilliant autobiography, the Dutch ‘are obsessed with numbers on the pitch - “he’s a 10, he’s a seven, he’s a six, he’s a four’.” It is new territory for United’s players.

They will have to adapt, to tune in to his obsession with the ability to make tactical adjustments in order to alter the outcome. This is football for thinkers.

Van Gaal has identified his potential back three and much depends on the potential recruitment of Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal.

With the departure of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic after their long and successful United careers, Van Gaal has a blank canvas at the back.

Phil Jones, a player Sir Alex Ferguson compared to the great Duncan Edwards in his final season at United, is expected to settle into a designated position in the team.

Jonny Evans, a spare part whenever Ferdinand and Vidic weren't fit enough to be paired together, may yet have a tailored role in United’s defence.

Van Gaal expects his teams to be flexible and the demands on his players, in training and in matches, will feel fresh and new.

In his spare time at the tournament he has been exploring his options with United, deviating from the 4-2-3-1 system that is an established practice in English and European football.

Luke Shaw, outstanding for Southampton last season and a member of England’s World Cup squad, has enormous potential on the left.

Although he is a naturalised left-back, he is young enough to develop his role in the same way as Gareth Bale.

If Van Gaal plays 3-4-3, Shaw will have licence to roam down that left-hand side and he is young enough to do the dog work to get back in time to defend.

There will be a whole new look about United next season and the players will be encouraged to gain a greater understanding about their roles on the pitch.

These are the principles of the school of science at Ajax, where Van Gaal took their famous young team to Champions League glory in 1995.

He intends to transform United, with a new philosophy working its way into their Carrington training centre before the start of the season.

Van Gaal wants a ball winner in the 
centre of the pitch, a strong-willed character who can feed United’s 
forward line when they regain possession.

United’s coach is on the lookout for 
someone like Nigel de Jong to provide that bite in the centre of the 
pitch alongside former Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera.

It means Michael Carrick, who player who 
has always divided opinion, faces a fresh challenge to keep his place in
 the United team. The competition will do him some good.

There is a big season ahead at United, 
particularly for a complex frontline that includes Robin van Persie, 
Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Juan Mata, Adnan Januzaj and Javier 
Hernandez.

Given the proximity of Van Persie’s relationship with his new manager, it seems inconceivable that the striker will be anything other than the main man up front.

When Van Gaal arrives for his first day at United, there will be no doubt who is in charge.
