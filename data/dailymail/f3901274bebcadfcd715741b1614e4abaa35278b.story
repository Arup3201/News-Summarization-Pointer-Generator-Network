Calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, to quit

Calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the NHS to quit after he admitted misleading MPs over a whistleblower.

Sir David Nicholson – described by critics as the Man With No Shame – received a letter from former trust boss Gary Walker four years ago raising concerns about patient care.

But on Monday Sir David told a Commons committee that Mr Walker ‘didn’t identify himself as a whistleblower ... nor did he raise with me any issues of patient safety’. 

Yesterday the NHS chief executive issued a humiliating correction after the original letter, which contradicted Sir David’s account, emerged.

The admission is damning for Sir David as it suggests Mr Walker, who broke a £500,000 gagging clause to reveal poor standards of care and a ‘culture of fear’, may not have been offered adequate protection as a whistleblower.

Sir David’s climbdown came on the same day that a leaked letter emerged revealing he has asked senior managers awaiting ‘substantial’ redundancy payouts to wait six months before reapplying for NHS jobs.

One of the aims, says Sir David, is to avoid ‘reputational damage’ to the health service. 

The letter will be seen by his critics as further evidence that Sir David is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the NHS as he effectively urges managers to keep quiet about their pay-offs.

He is already facing calls to step down over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly.

Yesterday he wrote to Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge to ‘correct one specific point of detail’.

He wrote: ‘In response to a question from Stephen Barclay MP about Gary Walker, I said that when he initially wrote to me, I thought that he did not identify himself as a whistleblower.

‘I have now had the opportunity to review the correspondence and would like to confirm that when Gary Walker wrote to me in July 2009 he did indeed ask to be considered as a whistleblower.’

He continued: ‘However, I would reassure you that the action I took at the time in response to Gary’s letter was appropriate. 

‘As I explained yesterday, I immediately commissioned a comprehensive independent investigation into the allegations that had been made.’ Mr Walker, former head of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, was sacked in 2010, allegedly for swearing in a meeting.

He maintains the real reason was his refusal to prioritise waiting list targets over emergency care for patients.

Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said it was now ‘impossible’ for Sir David to remain in his post.

She wrote a letter to the Prime Minister telling him Sir David should go ‘with all speed’. 

Insisting she had the support of 60 other MPs, she wrote: ‘I am deeply concerned that the man who currently leads the largest employer in the country has not only overseen a culture that has damaged our NHS, but has now given a false account to a Select Committee in this way.

‘Therefore there are serious questions of integrity to be answered. 

‘If, however, Sir David was really aware of none of this, it draws such questions over his competence and memory that he cannot be a man to oversee crucial reforms.’

Yesterday Mr Walker contradicted Sir David’s account when he gave evidence to MPs.

In his 2009 letter, he wrote: ‘I assume the Department of Health has a policy on whistleblowing and would therefore like this letter to be considered in that context.’

He also mentions the ‘significant risk to patients’ he believes was raised by attempts to force him out, and warns: ‘This is the sort of behaviour that gave the country a Mid Staffordshire.’ 

The letter also described a ‘culture of avoiding accountability and blaming and harassing others’.

Steve Barclay, who sits on the committee said: ‘He misled a Commons committee after being specifically asked about this twice.

On Monday, Sir David was criticised by MPs over his NHS expenses. Last year he racked up £50,000 in claims, the cost of employing two nurses for a year, on top of his £211,000 salary

‘He may have been woefully unprepared – or not expecting written evidence to catch him out.’ In response to Mr Walker’s letter, Sir David commissioned the Goodwin Report into ‘allegations of bullying and harassment’ at the hospital trust. 

All staff were cleared of the allegations and Sir David said they ‘acted appropriately throughout’. 

Last night Mr Walker said: ‘He lied when he said I was not a whistleblower, and that my concerns were investigated as I raised concerns about patient suffering and they were not investigated.’ 

Earlier he told MPs: ‘If people had put allegations like I misled a select committee and that I had lied... I would expect to be suspended and investigated.’ Anyone judged to have lied to a Commons committee could face jail after being charged with ‘contempt of the House’.

Sir David is backed by David Cameron and Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt but insiders believe he will resign within months. 

On Monday, Sir David was criticised by MPs over his NHS expenses. 

Last year he racked up £50,000 in claims – the cost of employing two nurses for a year – on top of his £211,000 salary.

His claims included first class rail tickets to go home to Birmingham at weekends. 

He is also under fire for hiring Dame Barbara Hakin, who Mr Walker alleges was the person who bullied him, as his deputy in an interim post last month. 

Sir David told MPs she was ‘very, very talented’.
