A young woman who welcomed her first-born son on Christmas Day had no idea she was pregnant.

Leanne Carter was admitted to hospital with stomach cramps in the early hours of Christmas morning and left with baby boy Joseph.

The 21-year-old from Ilkeston, Nottinghamshire said her son was ‘the most surprising and best present ever’.

Miss Carter said she had no physical symptoms throughout her pregnancy and only ‘became bloated’ in the last month.

‘It was a big surprise - I didn't know anything about it,’ she said. 'When I heard of these kind of things before I always thought 'how could you not know?‘

Miss Carter woke up at 2.30 on Christmas morning with what she believed to be severe period pains, and as they worsened her mother suggested they go to the hospital.

She said: ‘When I was there I went to the toilet and just felt the need to push. My mum had to go and get the staff and they asked if I was pregnant.

‘They wheeled me in and the first time I realised I was pregnant was when they gave me the gas and air as I was pushing.

‘I was shocked, then scared and worried and I didn't know if he was OK but then I was happy.'

Joseph was born at 8am on Christmas 
Day and weighed 4lb 12oz. Medical staff at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham 
believe he was born around two weeks early, but say he has suffered no 
lasting effects from his surprise entry in to the world.

Miss
Carter said she had carried on normal life throughout her pregnancy, 
and recently started working at a shop in her home town. Her periods 
continued as normal and she had not felt the baby moving around.

She said: ‘I did a lot of heavy lifting - he's had it tough, but he's fine. I just carried on life as normal, did my day-to-day stuff.’

Alison Atkinson, head of maternity at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘I'm delighted that Leanne and her baby are both well and happy.

‘It's rare for a woman to give birth without knowing she's pregnant but I'm pleased that it was a happy surprise.

‘It was also a lovely surprise for our team in the emergency department who were thrilled to be a part of this wonderful Christmas story.’

Joseph was equally a surprise for 
Leanne’s boyfriend Scott Curwood who she says was ‘shocked’ but happy 
about the birth of his son.

The couple are now hoping to find a house together; meanwhile Leanne and baby Joseph will live with her mother and grandmother.

Miss Carter said: ‘Joseph is definitely the most surprising but the best Christmas present ever.

‘He's very quiet and quite sleepy - my mum says he's the spitting image of me.

‘He's going to be tall; he's got massive feet and tiny little skinny legs.’

‘I didn't intend on having children for a
long while yet but I'm happy and I'm dead excited. It's still sinking 
in a little bit but I'm getting there.'
