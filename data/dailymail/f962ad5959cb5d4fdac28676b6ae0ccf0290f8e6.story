Loss: Stefano Riccioletti was the executive chef at The Shore Club's Terrazza

The witness who placed the initial 911 call at around 6am yesterday morning described Tomica as being ‘really drunk.’

Tomica was driving a 2007 Dodge Charger along Collins Avenue in Miami Beach and struck 49-year-old Riccioletti yards away from the Shelbourne Hotel.

She was apparently driving home after her shift at Nikki Beach, a bar and nightclub. The high-end bar did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

She was initially charged with driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, and freed on $10,000 bond, but blood alcohol tests returned this week increased the charge's severity.

Cuffed: Tomica was led away in handcuffs with new bail set at $77,000

Tomica was reportedly steadied by her attorney in court, weeping as prosecutors asked for her bail to be increased to $75,00.

She hadn't just killed Riccioletti, prosecutors said, but as a witness in another car followed her she 'actively evaded the [Good Samaritan] and even made U-turns to attempt to lose the car following her.'

Her bond was set at $77,000 and she was placed under house arrest with a GPS monitor.

She must attend three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings every week.

Prosecutors revealed horrific details from the scene, alleging Tomica left the 'battered, bloody and flesh smattered vehicle' all while ignoring pleas to wait for officers.

Seeking justice: Patrizia Pesce, the widow of 49-year-old chef Stefano Riccioletti, pictured with her attorney, Jose Baez, has filed a suit against Tomica for her alleged role in her husband's death

'Brain or flesh particulate was apparent in her hair,' when police caught up to her and she gave off a sense of 'impairment, as well as an odor of an unknown alcoholic beverage.'

She and Nikki Beach are both named in separate lawsuits from Riccioletti's son and widow. They claim the club allowed her to drink despite being underage then drive home impaired.

'She needs to feel the pain that we are feeling,' Riccioletti's wife, 
Patrizia Pesce, told CBS Miami. 'She really hit him hard. And she 
destroyed him. It wasn’t easy to see him like that.'

Mr Riccioletti, a father of two, was the executive chef at the exclusive Shore Club within the hotel and was just leaving work at the time that he was struck.

According to police reports, he was thrown several feet into the hotel’s driveway.

When paramedics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the chef DOA, according to WSVN.

The arrest affidavit states that Tomica fled the scene immediately after striking the chef. A Good Samaritan who witnessed the incident decided to trail the 20-year-old, placing a call to 911 at the same time.

Witness: This Good Samaritan, who declined to be identified, was integral in tracking down the young woman and reporting the alleged crime

‘I’m actually just following a car that just hit a man on Collins Avenue,’ the man said on 911 tapes, which were released today. ‘As far as I know, at this time, she must have killed him.’

The witness described Tomica as being ‘really drunk’ at the time of the incident.

According to NBC Miami, the witness followed Tomica back to her apartment, further down Collins Avenue.

The affidavit states that upon reaching her apartment, the young woman got out of her vehicle, handed the keys to a valet, and went into her apartment. 

When officers arrived at her apartment, they said in their report that Tomica had slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. She was pictured by NBC Miami being led from her apartment into custody, mascara streaks marring her face.

Tomica is pictured in tears in her booking photo, clutching her hands into fists below her face.

According to records, Tomica is from Port St. Lucie and has been a student at Florida International University.

The University told MailOnline she is currently not enrolled at the institution.

Both Tomica’s Twitter and Facebook pages have been deleted. 

Lucy Martin, the general manager of the Shore Club, issued a statement saying that Mr Riccioletti was ‘a valued member of our team and will be greatly missed.’
