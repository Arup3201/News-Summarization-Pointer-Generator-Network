The forecast was sunny and warm, with the thermometer sitting around 57 degrees.

But snow fell on the grounds of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta on Monday as part of a special surprise to 'add some magic' to the lives of the sick young patients.

In a city that rarely sees snow, staff at the hospital planned a secret operation to simulate a winter wonderland on its three campuses, teaming up with a special effects company that works with Disney.

Dozens of children - many tethered to I.V. poles and wearing masks - were lured outside as hidden snow machines blasted faux icicles from above, according to ABC News.

The hospital said it was way to let patients 'become kids', if only for a moment.

'Its a tough time to be in the hospital during the holidays and we thought it would be great to add some excitement and magic to the kids day here,' said chief Pediatrician Dr Jim Fortenberry

'What better way to do that than bring some snow?'

Doctors say it is therapeutic for the patients to take their minds of the illnesses.

For many, it was the first time they had seen snow, even if it were fake.

Only a handful of employees knew about the surprise, the hospital said, making the moment special for staff as well.

'The facility people were a huge help and got us access to the roof,' a spokeswoman said.

'We pulled it off with a few volunteer coordinators.'

'The staff, physicians and nurses didn't know about it.'

'It all started out as a desire to do something big for our patients,' the spokeswoman added.

'It's such a special time of year and kids in the hospital don't get to celebrate.'

The hospital hired Zigmont Magic F/X, a company that works with Disney on snow shows.

It assembled more than 31 snow machines holding 31 gallons of snow fluid on the roofs of all three facilities.

The white stuff looked real but felt a bit more like cotton.

Each hospital campus -- in Egleston, Scottish Rite and Hughes Spalding -- had arranged a party so that children and their families would be gathered in a place where they could see the falling snowflakes.

Children enjoyed arts and crafts and music with 'Frosty the Snowman' playing as the snow began to fall.

And that's a warp: As nighttime came and the snow dissipated, the patients went back inside. This one girl wanted to hand around and look at the Christmas tree though

'It really did accumulate on the ground,' said the spokeswoman.

'The snow felt more like soap,' she said.

'Kids were outside dancing in it and playing.

'They were making snow angels and even had snowball fights.'

'But it was more like throwing soap bubbles' she said.

'It was so special.'
