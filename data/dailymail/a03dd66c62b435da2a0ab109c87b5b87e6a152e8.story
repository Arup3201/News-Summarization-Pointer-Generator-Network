A father has been hailed as 'SpiderDad' after he donned a superhero costume to surprise his terminally ill son on his birthday.

Mike Wilson leapt from a roof at his family home in Basingstoke, Hampshire as part of the birthday stunt for five-year-old Jayden, who has a grade four brain tumour.

The heart-warming video of him surprising his son - a huge Spiderman fan - has since been viewed around the world.

Mike Wilson leapt from a roof above the family's front door in Basingstoke, Hampshire to surprise his son, Jayden, on his fifth birthday

Jayden has been diagnosed with a brain tumour and doctors gave him just a year to live

Jayden was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain stem tumour 15 months ago after his parents took him to hospital following a fall.

Mr Wilson told MailOnline: 'We couldn't believe it at first. You never expect something this bad to happen to any of your close family members.

'He was given an average of 12 months to live, and today he's still fighting it like a champ.'

Doctors have said Jayden's speech, movement and coordination will continue to deteriorate as he  receives treatment. He is currently finding it 

difficult to walk and has weakness in his left arm.

As Jayden's fifth birthday approached, Mr Wilson was determined to do something to make his son's day especially memorable.

Mr Wilson ordered a special suit to be made in the US before carrying out the stunt for Jayden's birthday

He is an expert in free-running and parkour so was able to pull off the jump without injuring himself

Mr Wilson then took the birthday boy inside and played with him while still in character as Spiderman

With his son's bedroom covered in Spiderman posters, Mr Wilson decided there was only one character he would want to wish him happy birthday.

Mr Wilson, who is an expert in parkour and free-running, said: 'I've always been a big Spiderman fan myself and, out of no influence, Jayden also absolutely loves him.

'I wanted to surprise him so much with one of his favourite heroes, so I found two costume designers local to me in Basingstoke, who were up for the challenge.

'We had the costume printed in America and then got to work putting it together. It was finished about three weeks before Jayden's birthday so perfect timing to work out how to surprise him.'

Family and friends were delighted to see the joy his father's entrance brought to the youngster's face

Mr Wilson added: 'Being a Spiderman fan, I hate it when people pretend to be Spiderman but can't do the right poses, I'm not perfect but I like to try doing my best.'

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive  brain tumours.

Unlike other cancers, which are more likely to strike as patients get older, GBM is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer.

Common symptoms include seizure, nausea, vomiting and headaches, although the most prevalent is a progressive neurological deterioration because of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes.

The average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually.

Glioblastoma is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cells are very resistant to conventional therapies.

Mr Wilson, who is a professional freerunner and has featured in films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Pirates of the Caribbean, spent half an hour playing with his son in character, leaving the youngster star-struck.

A video of the surprise stunt shows birthday boy Jayden venturing onto his front doorstep after it appears nobody is there.

But he is shocked to see Mr Wilson, concealed by his Spiderman outfit, fly down from the roof and wish him happy birthday.  

Jayden was given the CT scan in August last year after a fall and, following the discovery of a mass on his brain, he was transferred to a hospital specialising in brain surgery.

After an MRI scan and biopsy, doctors told his parents that he has cancer.

After what they described as 'the worst weeks of our lives', the couple launched a fundraising to make the rest of Jayden’s life full of special days.

The 'SpiderDad' video has been viewed more than 20,000 times on YouTube since it was posted this weekend.

Mr Wilson has also been inundated with messages of support on the family's Facebook and gofundme pages.

The tumour only came to light when Jayden (pictured with his parents, Lou and Mike, and his sister, Ella) was taken to hospital after banging his head last year
