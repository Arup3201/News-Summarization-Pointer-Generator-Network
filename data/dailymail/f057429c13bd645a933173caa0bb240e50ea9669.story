A student who was bodyslammed by an Ohio State football coach after running onto the field during a game on Saturday is losing his full tuition and housing scholarship, his attorney has said.

Anthony Wunder, 21, who has been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, will be removed from the Evans Scholars program for former golf caddies, defense attorney Mark Collins said.

The fourth-year mechanical engineering student's attorney entered a not-guilty plea in Franklin County Municipal Court on his behalf on Tuesday.

But afterwards, the sponsoring Western Golf Association released a statement  saying his scholar activities have been suspended but he will remain on scholarship until its investigation is complete.

Slammed: Ohio State conditioning coach Anthony Schlegel, a former Buckeyes linebacker, body slammed Anthony Wunder after he ran onto the field during gameplay on Saturday

'We are disappointed in Mr. Wunder's actions,' the statement read.

Wunder was stopped and slammed down by assistant strength and conditioning coach Anthony Schlegel, a former linebacker for the Buckeyes, during Ohio State's home victory over Cincinnati.   

Coach Urban Meyer said he had a somewhat serious conversation with Schlegel about the massive hit, which was captured by photographers and shared across social media. 

'I appreciated him protecting our players,' Meyer said. But 'I'd rather him not have a lawsuit if something bad would happen, you drill a guy like that.

'So we had a partial-serious conversation. And we also gave him a 'Hit City' award, our team, and had a little fun with it, too.' 

Schlegel caught the fan as he ran away from security personnel, wrapping his arms around him and throwing him to the turf. The record crowd of 108,362 roared its approval.

Wunder was then led off the field as Buckeyes players and team personnel congratulated Schlegel on the sideline. 

A complaint filed in Franklin County Municipal Court said Wunder, who is from Cincinnati, was drunk when he ran onto the field during Saturday's game, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

He was booked into the Franklin County jail and released after posting a $79 bond on Sunday.

If convicted, he would serve a maximum of 30 days in jail. 

On his LinkedIn page, Wunder writes that he had secured the 'four year caddying scholarship based upon academics, caddy record, financial need, and character'. 

Schlegel, the coach who bodyslammed him, was drafted by the New York Jets before playing for the Bengals and the Florida Tuskers. 

He then headed back to Ohio to work for his alma mater.
