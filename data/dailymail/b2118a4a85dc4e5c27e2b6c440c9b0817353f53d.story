This tiny animal may look like a clone of Dobby the house elf from the Harry Potter films, but it's actually a newborn puppy.

Owner Eduardo Landin, 35, who lives in the Brete neighbourhood of the city of Banda in the Argentinian province of Santiago del Estero said he was shocked when he noticed that one of his new puppies appeared to have a trunk instead of a nose.

He said: 'It was kind of similar but also shockingly different to the other puppies, so I realised it was in some way deformed and at first I thought it was dead. But then I saw it moving and trying to feed, so I helped it over to the mother and it managed to drink something but it's nose kept getting in the way.'

Bizarre: A puppy has been born in Argentina that resembles Dobby from the Harry Potter films

Stumped: Vets are baffled by the puppy's deformity

He said that the deformed puppy was one of a litter of 11 and was the only one that was not normal.

He added: 'I was amazed at how quickly word spread and loads of people are coming round to look at the tiny puppy, and take pictures and videos. One of the children that came round said it looked like a character from the Harry Potter movie and that's what everyone is calling it in the local media here.'

He said he had taken it to the local Animal Health Centre where the reason for the deformity puzzled vets, who added that they suspected the tiny puppy would not live much longer but told him to come back in 15 days if it was still alive.

Local media said that the deformation was due to the use of pesticides on farmland in the region

The owners said that some people have told them the dog is evil

Two local woman, Andrea Rico, 43, and Marcela Davila, 40, who are friends of the family are currently looking after the puppy and trying to keep it alive.

Andrea said: 'The mother has not rejected the puppy but he does have difficulty sucking, as his trunk gets in the way and it's like he's drowning.'

Local media said that the deformation was due to the use of pesticides on farmland in the region, although they admitted they had never seen anything similar before.

Eduardo said: 'We have had a few calls from people telling us it's evil and we need to kill it and burn the body. But that's just superstition talking, it is a mutation but it isn't evil.'
