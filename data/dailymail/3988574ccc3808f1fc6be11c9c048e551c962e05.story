Luis Suarez is available to make his La Liga debut in the first El Clasico of the season after the fixtures placed Real Madrid vs Barcelona the day after his biting ban ends.

The striker is eligible to make his Barcelona debut on October 26 with his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini ending the day before, and is likely to do so at the Bernabeu.

Suarez signed for Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million five-year deal, and will play in the second El Clasico of the season alongside new team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar on March 22.

All games subject to change for TV schedule

There is, however, a chance fixtures could change, should the TV schedule call for the El Clasico to be broadcasted on a different date.

Barcelona themselves tweeted: 'Real Madrid-FC Barcelona will take place on 25/26 October at Santiago #fcblive #clasico'

Should they move the showdown to the day before, Suarez would not be available to play.

The Uruguay striker was banned from all football-related activity after biting Chiellini at the World Cup and was not allowed a presentation after making the £75m switch.

Real will have their eyes on the Madrid derby, too.

Defending champions Atletico make the trip to the Bernabeu on September 14, with the return at the Vicente Calderon on February 8.

Barcelona will lock horns with Atletico in the second-to-last game, before facing Deportivo in their season closer.

It comes after Diego Simeone's men traveled to the Nou Camp for their final game last year to secure the La Liga title.

Neither will be keen for it to come to such a tense finale again.

Barcelona's season starts at the Nou Camp against Elche, a side that dodged relegation by a point and finished 16th last year.

It is a similar story for Real, who start at home against newly-promoted Cordoba, where £60m signing James Rodriguez will take to the pitch with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in a frighteningly-good forward line.

The Copa del Rey, which Real won last year with a 2-1 victory over Barcelona, is scheduled for May 30.
