Its accents and vocabulary are as different as its vast and varied landscapes.

And the diversity of dialects in the U.S. are showcased in all their glory in the Dictionary of American Regional English (Dare).

Fifty years after its inception, the fifth and final volume of the Dare dictionary has been published, covering words beginning with Sl to Z.

Talking my language: The Dare dictionaries highlights the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the United States

So now, words such as 'zydeco' join other bizarre terms such as 'upscuddle', 'pinkletink' and 'goozlum' in the completed volumes.

Highlighting the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the United States, the Dare dictionary is a record of American English as it is spoken by its residents - from its beginning up until the present.

Unlike other dictionaries, it does not record the standard language used throughout the country.

It instead documents regional and folk
speak; words, phrases and pronunciations which vary from one part of 
the country to the other.

And has proved to be an indispensable tool for many: Teachers, librarians, researchers, historians, playwrights, journalists physicians are all said to be faithful users of it.

Jessie Sheidlower, the 
Oxford English Dictionary's editor at large, told the New York Times: 'It’s a great and 
extremely comprehensive project that really shows more than we’ve ever 
known before about American dialect. I use it every day.'

The project began in 1962 when Frederic Cassidy, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was appointed editor of the first dictionary - the first to highlight the diversity of the American language.

Between 1965 and 1970, a team of more than 80 researchers travelled to 1,002 communities all over America to conduct face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people to gauge the depth and diversity of the spoken word.

The results of those interviews formed the basis of the first dictionary.

The dictionary was due to be published as one whole works by Harvard University Press. However - after earnest editing - it became clear by 1980 that publishing Dare as a single unit would be impossible.

It was then decided to publish each volume as and when it was ready, following the tradition of other historical dictionaries.

Upscuddle (Southern Appalachian mountains): A noisy quarrel

Feest (New York): Disgusted with/nauseated by

Pinkletink (Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts): A young frog

Rumpelkammer (Michigan): A junk room/closet

Futz (Chicago): To fool around, idle, waste time

Flug (Southern California/Kansas): Dust or lint that collects in pockets

Goozlum (Arizona): A viscous food such as sauce, gravy or pudding

Rantum Scoot (New York, Massachusetts): An outing with no definite destination

On the fritz (The North): Out of order, a state of disrepair or ruin

Strubbly (Pennsylvania German): Unkempt, dishevelled

Zydeco (Louisiana): Dance music in Louisiana Creole culture
