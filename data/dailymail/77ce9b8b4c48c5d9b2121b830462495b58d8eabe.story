Cars were left teetering on the edge while other vehicles were washed away in a mountain mudslide in Japan.

One person has been confirmed dead and 550,000 people have been told to evacuate after the car park was destroyed in the mudslide in Anan, Tokushima, Japan, yesterday.

Guests at the YMCA Anan Kokusai Kaiyo Center were left trapped after the hostel's car park collapsed in the landslide.

An evacuation advisory has now been issued to 550,000 people in the Kochi, Tokushima and Ehime regions.

Devastation has struck across parts of south and eastern Asia in the last few days, with 410 killed in a devastating earthquake in China, while a landslide in Nepal has claimed the lives of at 19 people with more than 150 still missing.

Rescue workers were forced to urgently evacuate tens of thousands of people in eastern India following the deadly landslide in neighbouring Nepal which blocked a river that could burst its banks and submerge scores of Indian villages. 

Authorities in Nepal said there was no hope that more than 150 missing people are still alive after being buried by piles of rocks, mud and upturned trees in Saturday's landslide in Mankha, about 75 miles east of Katmandu. Nineteen others are confirmed dead.

But as disaster workers continued to clear the debris yesterday, the danger area moved downstream to eastern India, where 125,000 people are in peril.

The landslide blocked a mountain river in Nepal, causing it to back up and form a massive lake that was threatening to overflow and flood the Indian villages.

'We are keeping our fingers crossed right now,' said Aniruddh Kumar, a senior disaster management official in India's Bihar state. He said it was not clear how much water might come down from the lake. 

The annual monsoon season, which runs from June through September, is vital for the largely agrarian economies of South Asia but every year also brings floods and landslides that kill thousands and submerge hundreds of villages.

Another landslide hit in a village in eastern Nepal yesterday, killing four people and leaving six others missing. And the death toll from a massive landslide in western India last week rose to 108, according to rescue official Sandeep Rai Rathore.

Meanwhile, some 10,000 troops used pickaxes and backhoes to clear roads and dig residents from collapsed homes today following an earthquake in southwest China that killed 410 people. 

Volunteer Jackson Zeng joined about two dozen classmates who headed to Yunnan province's Ludian county, where Sunday's 6.1-magnitude earthquake collapsed thousands of homes in an impoverished region of mountainous farmland.

'I grew up around here and these are my people. I'm not sure what I can do, but I will help any way that I can,' said Zeng, a third-year student at Kunming University of Science and Technology.

Zeng's black T-shirt contrasted with the scores of green fatigue-clad troops along the main road into the quake zone.

Paramilitary personnel with a backhoe and other heavy equipment pushed earth from a stretch of road affected by a landslide while Zeng and other students used their hands to push rocks over a cliff.

Many hundreds of volunteers have converged on the nearby city of Zhaotong en-route to the quake-hit areas - a typical phenomenon during disasters in China. 

Many came empty-handed but some were formed into company-sponsored units complete with uniforms and their own relief aid to distribute. 

The government also has sent thousands of tents, quilts, sleeping bags and cotton coats to the region, as well as folding beds, chairs and tables, and mobile toilets.

The quake struck an area of steep hills and narrow roads not suited to all the traffic of the massive relief effort and heavy rain today added to the complications. Much of the damage was due to landslides.

The Yunnan Civil Affairs Bureau said that 410 people had been killed and 2,373 injured, with 12 people still missing about 48 hours after the quake.

Rescuers pulled dozens of trapped people from the debris in the first couple of days.

A five-year-old boy was dug from a collapsed home on Monday and state media today released a photo taken in a hospital of two pregnant women who comforted each other while trapped in the rubble before they, too, were rescued.

Many of the homes in Ludian, which has a population of about 429,000, were rudimentary mud-brick structures that collapsed easily in the quake. 

Further from the worst-hit areas, landslides created barrier lakes where water levels were rising to pose a new threat to about 800 residents and seven power stations downstream, where sudden flooding could prompt power cuts, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
