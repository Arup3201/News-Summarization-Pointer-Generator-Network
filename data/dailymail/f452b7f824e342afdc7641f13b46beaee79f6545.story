Little more than ten years ago, they were barely known and barely used. The only people who really knew of their existence were military experts who used them for secretive surveillance missions.

But following a decade of conflict fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, drones have become an essential and controversial tool for the U.S. military.

Operators - who you imagine are rather fond of computer games - sit in offices in New York and Nevada and direct the unmanned, missile-carrying planes to their next targets.

Secretive: Military drones have massively increased in popularity over the past decade. But there are now very real fears that they could be used by government's domestically. This is a German Mikrokopter

Controversial: President Obama signed a new law last year which opens up the possibility of police forces in the U.S. using drones. This image shows just how small some of them could be

As well as being used for spying, they are increasingly used to kill. And with an alarming accuracy.

But with their popularity booming under the liberal-leaning President Obama, there are now very real concerns about their use on a more domestic level.

In February last year, Obama signed a law directing America's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow drones to fly in American airspace by September 2015.

As reported by National Geographic, they could be used for patrolling borders for illegal immigrants, hunting for criminals and even maintaining crops. A number of police forces in the U.S. have already shown an interest in using drones, with some likely to carry face-recognition software.

Lethal: Drones have been used heavily by President Obama in Afghanistan to spy on targets and kill enemy fighters. This is an MQ-9 Reaper, armed with laser guided missiles

Future: A whole new fleet of drones, such as this one pictured, are currently being designed by aviation companies as well as government and university researchers

This has already caused a storm of opposition from across the political spectrum over the effecton personal privacy.

And if they become a regular fixture in the U.S, then it seems increasingly likely it is a matter of time before they are introduced into the skies of the UK.

In the past decade drones have become a must-have weapon for the most advanced militaries in the world.

Back in 2002, when America and the western world was looking down a barrel of conflict in some of the most dangerous and inhospitable locations on Earth, just 200 military drones were in use by the U.S. military.

But, with the U.S. and UK fighting mobile enemies in a variety of locations, drones increased dramatically.

The U.S. military has now deployed more than 11,000. And it is not just the U.S which is using them.

More than 50 countries have drones, including China, Iran and Israel.

Concerns: A number of police forces across the U.S. have already taken a keen interest in drones. This Seattle police officer shows off a drone recently, before the city's mayor banned their use by officers

Way forward: This Dragonflyer X6 helicopter was another drone owned by Seattle police before privacy concerns prevented them from being used

As well as saving money, they also save lives. Instead of sending pilots into war zones, military commanders can instead send an unmanned drone which is controlled thousands of miles away from danger.

This has led some defence experts to suggest that within a generation they could replace most manned military aircraft.

Talking point: Many of the images of drones used in this piece were first published in the March issue of National Geographic magazine, pictured

But it is now looking increasingly likely that drones will be deployed more domestically. A whole new fleet of drones are currently being designed by aviation companies as well asÂ  government and university researchers.

And, perhaps frighteningly, some are just the size of a hummingbird.

Following the law signed by Obama, it emerged recently that American authorities are increasing the number of licenses for surveillance drones.

The FAA announced earlier this month that it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, which is far more than were previously known.

The permits have been issued to police, universities, transport departments and at least seven federal agencies for devices from unarmed Predators drones to model airplanes.

The FAA estimates that as many as 10,000 drones could take to the skies by 2020.

But this has sparked opposition in the U.S from across the political spectrum with many concerned about the effects of drones on personal privacy and government intrusion.

Lawmakers in 15 states are already looking at plans to restrict drone use in their airspace amid concerns over spying.

Earlier this month the mayor of Seattle even ordered the city's police to abandon its plan to use drones after protests from residents and privacy campaigners.
