A New York-based reporter is claiming that she had an affair and child with Liam Gallagher and she is now suing him for $3million.

Liza Ghorbani was identified by the New York Daily News and The New York Post as the American journalist filing the lawsuit against Gallagher. She has written profile stories about rock-and-roll stars for Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

The alleged love child is thought to be just under a year old, and she is thought to have met the rocker originally when she wrote an article for The Times' 'A Night Out With' column where she detailed her trip to a New York City bars with Gallagher in May 2010.

Last night the rock star was in Ibiza for a music festival, and appeared unfazed by the allegations about his private life.

Ghorbani, 39, reportedly claims she gave birth to the former Oasis singer's 
daughter less than a year ago.

 Gallagher, 40, married All Saints singer Nicole Appleton in 2008 and 
already has three children. He was previously married to actress Patsy 
Kensit.

The New York Post 
reports that Ghorbani has had a DNA test performed to confirm that 
Gallagher is the father of her now-7-month-old daughter.

'Liza
 met Liam when she interviewed him for the Times and they began an 
affair. It continued until around three months after the birth of the 
child. He ended the relationship when she told him she was suing him for
 child support,' a source told the paper.

'Liam admitted the child is his in an e-mail, saying she is a beautiful child because she has "rock star genes,"' they continued.

After paying for the medical costs of the
 birth herself, Ghorbani is now suing him in the Manhattan Family Court 
for $3million, which was listed as 'Anonymous vs Anonymous'.

It has been reported that Magistrate Matthew Troy adjourned the case's first hearing last Friday until later this month. 

Today Liam Gallagher's spokesman told 
MailOnline: 'Lawyers are taking action against the New York Post. We are
 not going to comment on gossip.'

The
 New York Post has alleged that the Beady Eye frontman was the rock star
 embroiled in a desperate battle to prevent his wife learning that he 
has secretly fathered a daughter during a one-night stand.

Ghorbani is publicly connected to Gallagher through their 'Night Out' interview that ran in The New York Times in May 2010, detailing how she met up with him at the Ritz Carlton bar and then went on to Norwood, a private club in Chelsea.

'Not
 a lot of people look cool these days — like my cool... Everybody plays 
it down, don’t they?' she quotes the then-married singer saying in the 
article.

She opened the article describing how the rock star-turned-fashion designer was seen 'sauntering along Central Park West' and said that he 'turned more than a few heads' in the hotel bar.

She went on to mention that he had recently been named 'Greatest Frontman of All Time' by British music magazine Q, and likened his look to that of Rolling Stones star Brian Jones and Ray Davies of The Kinks.

Ghorbani's 
list of other feature subjects includes a number of British musicians 
like Robbie Williams, The Kooks and Marianne Faithful.

Gallagher is father to three other children- one daughter and two sons.

His daughter Molly was conceived when he had an affair with Lisa Moorish two months after he married his first wife, Patsy Kensit. 

Moorish, who also has a son with fellow British rocker Pete Doherty, initially tried to keep the paternity of her daughter a secret but it was revealed after Gallagher's divorce from Kensit.

He had been paying Moorish £2,000 per month in child support throughout the marriage, since Molly was born in 1998.

'It is his child and when I was pregnant he was paying her to keep quiet. Everyone was lying to me about it,' Kensit has said of Gallagher's first love child.

Kensit gave birth to Gallagher's son Lennon in 1999 but the couple had already disolved their marriage at that point.

Gallagher began dating Nicole Appleton in 2000 and they had a son, Gene, in 2004. The pair wed in 2008.

Gallagher, who now fronts the band Beady Eye, performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival yesterday when the news broke.

A housekeeper at the star’s £2.7million five-bedroom townhouse on the edge of Hampstead Heath, North London, said the whole family had ‘gone away’.

The singer once said he wanted to move his entire family to New York as soon as his children have finished school, and last year bought a £1.6million apartment near Central Park.

He was raised in low-income housing in Burnage, Manchester, by his mother Peggy after his abusive father left.

He has a famously frosty relationship with his brother and former Oasis bandmate Noel, once pulling out of the phenomenally successful Britpop band’s American tour 15 minutes before the plane was due to leave.

The pair have not spoken since Noel, now 46, walked out of Oasis in 2009. Liam recently revealed that he does not even have his brother’s phone number
