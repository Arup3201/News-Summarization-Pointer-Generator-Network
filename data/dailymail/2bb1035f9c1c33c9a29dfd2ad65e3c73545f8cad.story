'Shell of a man': Former Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth was haunted by the accusations

A police chief committed suicide while being investigated over allegations he sexually harrased female colleagues, a coroner has ruled.

Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth, 49, hanged himself in his garage fearing he would 'lose everything' because of the misconduct inquiry.

A total of 13 staff - mainly women -  from Wiltshire Police made 27 allegations about his alleged untoward behaviour.

The £110,000-a-year officer - who 
dreamed of leading his force and becoming ‘Sir David’ - allegedly told a
 woman ‘nice buttons’ while looking at her shirt, in one of the claims.

Shortly before his death he told told a psychologist that it had dawned on him how his behaviour had upset people.

However, recording a verdict of suicide, Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley accepted that there was nothing to indicate police and health professionals should have known that 
there was an immediate risk to his life.

Father-of-four Mr Ainsworth - known as
 'The Brain' because of his strong intellect - did not face any criminal
 charges but there was a possibility he may have faced a police 
disciplinary panel.

After the verdict, Chris Hoare, 
Wiltshire Police Authority Chairman, confirmed there were up to 13 
potential victims of DCC Ainsworth and the claims were still being 
looked into.

He said: 'Further to the coroner’s 
verdict today, our sincere and heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are 
with David’s family, partner Joanna and friends in these tragic 
circumstances.

'This has been an exceptionally 
difficult period for all concerned, not only for David’s family, partner
 and friends, but also for many within our organisation.

'We note that the coroner recognised 
that we had put in place comprehensive welfare arrangements which 
focussed on David’s needs.

'A good employer has a duty of care to
 all its employees. They need to feel able to raise concerns - and know 
they will be dealt with.

'Thirteen members of staff raised a 
total of 26 individual allegations which were being investigated by an 
outside force at the time of David Ainsworth’s tragic death.

'The staff and managers who came forward did so bravely, rightly and properly. They will continue to receive our full support.'

Among the claims were allegations that
 Deputy Chief Con. Ainsworth looked at a woman work colleague wearing a 
tailored blouse and remarked 'nice buttons'.

The inquest earlier heard from his estranged 
wife, Emma Ainsworth, who said the man she knew had 'become a shell of 
his former self?' after the allegations had emerged.

She said: 'David was just a shell,' she told the coroner after recalling seeing Mr Ainsworth in the weeks leading to his death.

'The children were visibly shocked. They didn’t know what to say to him.

'He looked physically ill. He looked like he should be in hospital. The children said he couldn’t even work his mobile phone.'

She told the inquest in Trowbridge, 
Wilts., that the effect the allegations had on him was a far cry from 
the man who dreamed of having one of the top jobs in the police force.

'His ultimate goal was to be Chief Constable,” said Mrs Ainsworth, who lives in Coxheath, Kent.

'His dream was to become "Sir David". He was extremely intelligent and would often leave people unable to keep up with him.'

He had joined the Wiltshire force in 
2008 and had previously worked for 22 years with Kent Police.

He was the
 Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on vehicle crime. He became depressed and sought treatment in January 2011.

Miss Howes sobbed as she told how she found his body on March 22 last year.

‘He felt abandoned by a police service he devoted his life to,’ she added.

Verdict: suicide.
