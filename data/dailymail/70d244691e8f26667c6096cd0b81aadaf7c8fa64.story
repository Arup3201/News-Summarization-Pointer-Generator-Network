Tragedy: The parents of Luke Weaving-Shorrocks were told he was dead, only for the baby to be rushed to intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth

Doctors told a first time mother her baby was dead only for the infant to start breathing and be rushed into intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth, an inquest heard.

Midwives had expected Victoria Weaving-Shorrocks, 33, to give birth after eight hours, but she was only offered a Caesarean-section after seven further hours of difficulties delivering naturally.

When her baby Luke was born, weak and barely breathing, Mrs Weaving said she saw a 'look of dread and panic' on the faces of maternity staff - some who were reduced to tears during the delivery.

Staff at Wigan Infirmary in Greater Manchester battled to 
revive him for 20 minutes before paediatrian Dr Martin Farrier told her:
 'I think dad knows what I’m about to say. Unfortunately there was 
nothing we could do.'

However, around 36 minutes after his birth Luke 
suddenly took a 'couple of breaths' and was rushed
 into intensive care. He was kept in hospital for a further five weeks 
before being sent home by doctors - to the surprise of his parents.

Luke, was left severely brain damaged after his brain was starved of oxygen during the birth, died aged only three months after he  stopped breathing during a feeding session.

At the inquest into her baby's death Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, a travel firm consultant, claimed the length of the labour may have cost her son his life.

'I think labour went on incredibly long,' said Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, of Wigan.

'I felt it should have been recognised that I had delivery problems naturally.

'After that lunchtime period I felt I 
was just left. It wasn’t staffing issues because I had two midwives. I 
wasn’t a priority, I was a first time mum having a long labour.'

When asked about having a Caesarean-section 
sooner she told the hearing in Bolton: 'I feel that it may have saved my
 baby’s life. Letting me push the way I did, they couldn’t get him out. I
 think that maybe in hindsight I would be demanding a c-section.

Parents: Richard and Victoria Weaving-Shorrocks believe their son might have survived if his mother had been offered a caesarean section earlier in her labour

'I would have asked for an earlier delivery. I felt they left me a long time. If they had to put me on a drip things weren’t going particularly normally. I just feel like something could have been done earlier.'

The tragedy occurred after Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, who conceived Luke after fertility treatment and had a normal pregnancy, was admitted to Wigan Infirmary at 1am on May 17 2011 when her waters broke.

Midwives were initially happy with her progress and there was no suggestion she was at risk.

'I was told that I was fully dilated and everything seemed to be progressing normally,' she told the hearing.

'But by 10am I never really got a really strong urge to push, if anything things seem to be slowing down. By mid-morning contractions started to diminish and after midday I was reviewed by a consultant.

Birth: Staff at Wigan Infirmary in Greater Manchester battled to revive Luke for 20 minutes before paediatrian Dr Martin Farrier told his mother: 'Unfortunately there was nothing we could do'

'Yet there was never any mention of there being any concerns with the baby’s heart rate. I was reassured everything was going as normal.'

Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks later had an epidural to help her push for longer but by 3pm there was still so sign of her baby and she was taken to theatre for a caesarean section at 4pm.

During the procedure it was discovered
 Luke’s head had become stuck in his mother’s pelvis with doctors 
struggling to extricate him.

He was left with severe brain damage after being starved of oxygen and suffering a fractured skull and bleed on the brain.

Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks said: 'Being a first time mum you expect a longer labour and there was nothing for me to be concerned about. The midwife were so reassuring, that I was heading towards a normal natural delivery.

Breathing: Around 36 minutes after his birth Luke suddenly took a 'couple of breaths' and was rushed into intensive care. He was kept in hospital for a further five weeks before being sent home by doctors

'There was never anything to make me feel there was concerns-until after 3pm. It was then I remember thinking "I’m sure my baby should be born by this point". I remember the midwife saying you should have had this baby born by 9am.

'I started to think why is it taking all this time. I remember the midwife saying she was going to find someone because they had not been to check on me for some time.

'A c-section was mentioned as a back up and I put all my faith in them to make the decision. If I had any concerns I would have asked to go in for a c-section earlier.

'I would never have put my baby at risk. I thought this was the natural progression and this was best for my baby.

Tender: Mr Weaving-Shorrocks with his baby son, who was left with severe brain damage after the traumatic birth

'In theatre there was no sense of urgency or panic and then the atmosphere totally changed. There was a sense of panic on people’s faces, a look of dread on people’s faces. I knew something wasn’t right.'

Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks told the hearing that when her baby was born he did not cry, and she knew that something was wrong as she looked at her husband.

'I knew from Richard’s face that something wasn’t right and then it was when Dr Farrier came and told me that unfortunately he had not made it,' she said.

'I remember lying there and Richard sat at the side of me holding my hand. I remember asking why my baby was not crying. Everybody’s faces said it all.

'Then Dr Farrier said, "I think dad knows what I’m about to say that unfortunately there was nothing we could do". I always remember those words.

'I was in shock. All I was thinking was ‘this was my fault, how can I not deliver him’. I was taken to recovery to try and digest the news that this baby we were having had been born with no signs of life.'

However, later in the recovery room another doctor told the couple Luke was in fact in intensive care on a ventilator and he was transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford.

She added: 'Nobody ever mentioned life expectancy to us because nobody could tell us. There was a lot of confusion what was actually wrong with him. His heart stopped on a couple of occasions. We were even woken up at 3am to get him christened.

'They couldn’t tell us what ability he would have, if he would have any motor skills. It was a waiting game. It was a case of taking every day as it came.'

Mr Weaving-Shorrocks, a vehicle technician said in the moments after the birth he saw midwives in tears and added: 'It went from him dying and straight into the intensive care.

Infant: The couple were allowed to take their son home on June 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering CPR if he collapsed

'After he had died he was in recovery. The doctor told us that he had never seen it before, that the baby had taken a couple of breaths and they have resuscitate him.'

Luke regained consciousness but 
doctors told the family he had a 'very limited' life expectancy.

The couple were allowed to take their son home on June 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering CPR if he collapsed.

Mr Weaving-Shorrocks said: 'I was quite astonished Luke being sent home later when we knew very little about his condition and the way we should approach the condition.

'We only got very little resuscitation lessons and I remember saying to Vic we should know more.

'He was never expected to live as long as he did. I remember receiving a letter saying cerebral palsy.'

Condition: Throughout his short life Luke had to be fed through a tube. His condition deteriorated and on August 14 he was rushed back into hospital where he was pronounced dead

Throughout his short life Luke had to be fed through a tube. His condition deteriorated and on August 14 he was rushed back into hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Midwife Christina Lowe said Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks had, 'been progressing really well' during labour.

She said: 'I wasn’t concerned about the foetal wellbeing. It was a long labour but it can happen with first time mums. There was no sign of an obstructive labour.'

Dr Farrier said attempts were made to revive Luke for 20 minutes after he was born but he showed no signs of life for a further 16 minutes after that.

'I remember looking at dad and recognising absolute terror,' he told the hearing.

I did not expect Luke to survive, I believed the outcome was inevitable.

'I believe I said that I did not expect Luke to survive. Babies typically die some hours later, usually 12-24 hours, it was my expectation that he would not survive.

'It was the most extraordinary moment of my career when I recognised that he was breathing. We had 36 minutes of no significant output.'

He said Luke would have suffered brain and heart damage because of the conditions he was born in.

The hearing continues.
