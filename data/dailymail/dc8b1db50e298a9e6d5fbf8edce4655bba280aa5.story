The streets will soon be awash with the tears of Twihards, as Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are back in each other's arms again.

Sadly, it's just in newly released photos from the set of the next Twilight movie, Breaking Dawn 2, which was filmed long before 'Trampire-gate.'

Summit released more photos from the 
upcoming film as Pattinson, 26, tries to fend off questions about his 
former live-in girlfriend while promoting David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis.

Kristen, 22, has kept a lower profile
since compromising pictures of her and 41-year-old married director 
Ruper Sanders emerged.

She even missed a promotional event 
for her latest film, a film adaptation of Jacques Kerouac's cult classic
On the Road, in London today, though it's been confirmed by People.com 
she will attend the Toronto Film Festival between September 6 to 16th.

In one new still, Kristen is depicted
with red vampiric eyes; as all fans know, her character Bella was 
turned by Edward at the end of Breaking Dawn Part One after she nearly 
died during childbirth.

It's almost too much to bear: Robert gazes at Kristen adoringly... it's possible he'll never look at her the same way again

The lady is a vamp: Bella looks great as a vampire, but let's hope this shot isn't used to help demonise young Kristen

The shot will be grist to the mill 
for those who didn't take Will Ferrell's joke 'trampire' skit on Conan 
O'Brien in the spirit in which it was attended.

Ferrell, 45, was gently mocking the 
hoopla surrounding the affair but many have taken the joke label 
seriously and used it to attack Kristen.

Forget vampires, it's more like a 
modern witch hunt; strange that a young girl should draw so much more 
fury than a married man twice her age.

In terms of box office forecasts, 
experts don't think that the scandal will have much impact on the 
long-awaited film, which is released on November 16.

'While it is studio policy not to 
comment on the personal lives of actors, Summit is moving full steam 
ahead and looking forward to this November's opening of The Twilight 
Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 2,' Nancy Kirkpatrick, the studio's president 
of worldwide marketing, told Entertainment Weekly.

The shots give an insight into the 
plot of the film, which involves the lovers’ battle with the Volturi 
vampire clan over the fate of their fast-growing daughter Renesmee, 
played by Makenzie Foy.

In another shot, the Cullens' are seen lined up in defence.

There was a similar scene last night 
at Time Talks with David Carr when he attempted to draw Robert onto the 
subject of his split.

The present audaciously compared the 
break up to Princess Diana, as she was then, and Prince Charles 
splitting but before a shocked Robert could rebuff it, the audience 
started booing before one member yelled: 'Next question?'
