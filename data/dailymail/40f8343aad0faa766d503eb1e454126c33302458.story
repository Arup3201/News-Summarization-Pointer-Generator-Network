In football an own goal is a reasonably common occurrence, but in rugby an 'own try' is not something that has ever happened before.

Until Thursday night anyway, when an extraordinary incident took place in the Australian National Rugby Championship match at the Leichhardt Oval between the Sydney Stars and North Harbour Rays.

Fans and players alike at the New South Wales venue were stunned when referee Ian Smith awarded the 'own try' against Rays forward Mitch Lewis during the Stars' 49-40 win. To make the situation even more ludicrous, Smith made the decision having consulted the television match official (TMO).

The incident occurred in the 21st minute of the National Rugby Championship clash, with the Stars  attacking the Rays' line.

Lewis ripped the ball from Sydney hooker James Willan, and placed it back over his own line, thinking he'd conceded a five-metre scrum.

Referee Ian Smith was unsure about what had happened so referred the decision to TMO Michael Blair to see if Willan had scored. Despite it being clear that it was Lewis who grounded the ball, referee Smith awarded the try to the Stars as the Rays forward looked on in astonishment.

The official scoresheet for the match credited the controversial try to Willan, who was the closest Stars player to the ball.

Sydney missed the subsequent conversion but the five points helped them to their 49-40 win.

Reflecting on the incident Lewis told the Australian Daily Telegraph, 'I will be a walking, talking trivia question for a long time I guess.'

A disbelieving Lewis later admitted, 'I will be a walking, talking trivia question for a long time I guess'

'I ripped the ball out and I had possession of it. I went to place it and as I was placing it back I wasn't sure if I should put it over the line.

'I thought it would be a five-metre scrum and I thought that would actually be the safest option.

'When the referee decided to go upstairs, I couldn't believe it but I thought, TMO will see it, fine, we'll still be safe.

'I was waiting to pack and scrum down.

'Then the decision came back for the try. You have probably seen the video, you can probably see my reaction. I couldn't believe it. I was trying to process it, I was a bit puzzled and bemused. I didn't know what to do, I thought with all today's technology it'd be sweet. We'd seen it but I don't know how they missed it.'

It's unlikely Lewis will be involved in an incident as strange as this again.
