Schoolchildren have been banned from playing traditional games tag and British Bulldog because teachers claim they are too dangerous.

Parents of children at Egerton Community Primary near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were told in a newsletter that children can no longer play the playground games.

In the letter, the school says: 'What we have observed is a situation where children were being hurt because they were not moving about the playground safely and because they were playing games that, in a smaller space, were causing them to have accidents.

Banned: Children at Egerton Community Primary, Bolton, are no longer allowed to play tag or British Bulldog

'It is not acceptable for us to accept that children will get hurt while playing and it is our job to ensure that the playground and playtimes are organised well to ensure safety.'

Pupils may use the playing 
fields when the weather is good, but the majority of the year have break 
times in the playground.

A group of parents have now launched an online petition calling for the decision to be reversed.

Kirstin Jackson, 40, from Egerton, who launched the campaign, said: 'I started the petition because I want my kids to be able to run around.

'It's a real shame that children can't be children. There are times when you've just got to let them be kids.'

The petition, which already has more than 50 signatures, states that participating in games such as tag far outweighs the occasional accident.

Mrs Jackson, a teaching assistant at another school whose two sons attend Egerton Community Primary, added: 'Accidents happen, it's normal, it gives children the opportunity to measure their own risks, and it's a learning curve for them.'

Another mother with two children at the school, who asked to remain anonymous, added: 'I just think children need to be children, we can't wrap them up in cotton wool.

'I do understand it is for the safety of the children and that the school wants to prevent accidents but there are so many benefits children get from playing games like tig. Accidents do happen but it's all part of growing up.'

But bosses at Egerton Community Primary have defended the decision, and stressed alternative play zones had been created for games like football and basketball.

Headteacher Sam Mitchell said: 'Following a number of injuries to pupils, the school reviewed safety in the playground and has asked pupils not to play tag and British bulldog.

'Instead, to improve safety and enjoyment for all children, the school has introduced play areas identified for a range of activities co-ordinated by a play leader.

'Children have been asked to respect each other's play and safety and have told us that they are enjoying their new playtimes.'
