Michelle Obama jumped on the latest sports pose craze in a meeting with San Francisco 49ers star quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

The First Lady is pictured in Instagram photos posted by the footballer mimicking his famous bicep-kissing goal celebration.

He wrote on the photo-sharing service: 'I got the opportunity to meet one of the greatest women in the world, the first lady @first_Obama and even got her #Kaepernicking.'

Latest sports pose craze: First Lady Michelle Obama strikes the Kaepernicking pose with its inventor Colin Kaepernick, quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, in this image that he posted to Instagram

Big smiles: Kaepernick met Mrs Obama yesterday. He first struck his now trademarked pose in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs, when the 49ers knocked out the Green Bay Packers

Kaepernick is just the latest in a 
line of NFL players to come up with a trademark stance to mark their 
finest moments on the field.

The
first, and as yet most famous, was dreamed up by devout Christian 
quarterback Tim Tebow while playing for the Denver Broncos.

Tebowing,
which involved kneeling on one knee, with an elbow resting on the other
and looking solemnly towards the ground in prayer, became a craze that 
swept the internet.

Another
such craze was started by Washington Redskins' young star Robert 
Griffin III, who celebrated his first professional touchdown pass by 
half lying on the ground and raising his arms in celebration.

The
pose, quickly dubbed 'Griffining', caught on with Redskins fans and 
others, who started posting pictures of themselves copying it to 
Twitter.

Now there are whole websites devoted to both Griffining and Tebowing.

The first: Kaepernick unknowingly launches his meme in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs

Kaepernicking has now taken off in much the same way, after its eponymous inventor first struck the post in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs, when the 49ers knocked out the Green Bay Packers.

It success has been such that the 25-year-old, who grew up in Turlock, California, has even taken steps to trademark the pose.

As the Bleacher Report points out, that means Obama probably owes Kaepernick some royalties.
