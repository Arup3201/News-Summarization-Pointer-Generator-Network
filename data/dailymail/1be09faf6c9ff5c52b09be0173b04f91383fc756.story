Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock remembers the first time he clapped eyes on Yannick Bolasie.

'I remember he played up front for us when I was at QPR in a practice match and I remember saying to Flavio (Briatore, who owned QPR), "I can get this lad on £2,000 a week and he's worth a shot, he won't cost anything".

'And he said: "No you can't sign anyone, I'm selling the club". I'll never forget it.

Crystal Palace were unlucky not to take three points from a game that, at times, left Neil Warnock bewildered

'So I said to Bolasie: "If I were you I'd go south and get games under your belt". He got a contract offer (at Plymouth Argyle) and never forgets that.' Thankfully for Warnock, he can finally work with the talented winger.

Spurs have 10 points from a possible 24 at White Hart Lane this season

And where would Palace be without their mesmeric attacking midfielder? He was at his bewildering best on Saturday as Palace left Tottenham unlucky not to have recorded a shock win.

One piece of skill in the left-hand corner, that left Eric Dier and Ryan Mason for dead, was particularly outrageous.

'It's obvious I've been working with him in training,' joked Warnock. 'Some days he does a trick and you laugh at him, it's laughable. It's spontaneous. You never see him practise it.'

Pochettino complained that Palace were given one day more rest after the midweek fixtures

Bolasie signed a three-year deal in the summer but has been promised a further improvement to his contract should he continue to produce these kind of displays.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino even pinpointed the 25-year-old as Palace's most potent attacking threat ahead of Saturday's clash. Not that it helped nullifying the Congo international's impact.

Pochettino provided another explanation as to why his side struggled against Warnock's men. 'When you compete in the same condition as the opponent then it's not a problem,' he said. 'We played Chelsea on Wednesday, but Palace played Aston Villa on Tuesday and had one day more (to recover). I don't complain about it but when you have one less day to prepare then it's difficult.

'We don't feel the Premier League helps us. This week we play Thursday in Istanbul, arrive home very late and then have a trip to Swansea.

'The Europa League is a very tough competition because it kills all the teams.'
