An eight-year-old girl claims she was taped to a chair by her teacher as punishment for sharpening her pencils too often.

Mia Kramer was excited to be starting second grade at Hollinger Elementary School in Tucson, Arizona, but all that changed after her experience last Thursday.

According to the young girl, who has ADHD, her teacher scolded her for walking to the pencil sharpener too many times and told her to sit down.

Mom Maria Vasquez is upset and angry after her daughter Mia Kramer was tied to a chair at Hollinger Elementary School in Tucson, Arizona last Thursday

Kramer claims the teacher taped her to her chair and demonstrates to KGUN9 how it was done

She claims the teacher taped her to a chair, with one strip going around her stomach and another higher up, preventing her from putting her arms down.

Other students were present during the incident, which Kramer said hurt ‘a little.’

‘It felt like something's happening to me and it's wrong,’ she told KGUN9 News.

Her outraged mom doesn’t believe her daughter deserved to be treated in such a way.

‘She likes to be happy and they tied her to a chair,’ Maria Vasquez told KGUN9.

‘Regardless if it was a little tape - she got tied to a chair where she couldn't move. That's not right.’

Kramer says a second piece of tape prevented her from putting her arms down

Mia's mom Maria Vasquez was so angry about what happened that she reported the incident to the Tucson Police Department who are investigating it as a possible assault

She has reported the incident to the Tucson Police Department who are investigating it as a possible assault.

In the meantime the Tucson Unified School District has pulled the teacher from class.

‘We take these things very seriously. Obviously such behavior is not appropriate or acceptable and is not part of any district protocol,’ read a statement from the district.

‘The teacher is not in the classroom pending the outcome of the investigation. The complaint has been referred to district leadership and if it’s determined that this incident took place, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.’

Kramer hasn't returned to school since the suspected incident.

ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a psychiatric disorder which causes significant problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and acting impulsively.
