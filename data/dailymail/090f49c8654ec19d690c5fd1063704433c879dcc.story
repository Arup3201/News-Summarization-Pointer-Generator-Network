A new documentary is set to hit our screens in December, which will lift the lid on the sugar daddy dating phenomenon; an industry which is quietly booming in the U.S., but one that is, for many, little understood.

Daddies Date Babies follows the trials and tribulations of five New York-based 'sugar babies' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to 'sugar daddies' - wealthy, generally older men - in return for financial support.

'The women want as much money as possible for as much stability as possible,' one participant says in the film's trailer. 'The men want to pay as little as possible for as much novelty as possible.'

Lucrative: New documentary Daddies Date Babies follows five  'sugar babies' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to 'sugar daddies' - wealthy, older men - in return for financial support

The concept behind the short documentary was formed after filmmaker Parinda Wanitwat happened across immersive journalist Melanie Berliet's undercover account on being a 'sugar baby,' penned for Vanity Fair.

The site Miss Berliet used to source her Sugar Daddy encounters was Seeking Arrangement; the industry's Match.com equivalent, and the site where Ms Wanitwat was to source her film's subjects.

Launched in 2006, Seeking Arrangement matches willing sugar babies - 44per cent of whom are female college students - with wealthy sugar daddies. It's free to join for women, and there are approximately eight women for every one man on the site. 

'I got into sugar babying because I didn't have a job, had graduated from college and needed money,' one of the film's subjects, 25-year-old Tess Wood, told The Huffington Post. 'It seemed easier than bar-tending. It seemed like a very available option. It seemed easy to fall into.' 

Trauma: This woman specifically admits to being raped. 'My life needs to change,' she says

Ms Wood, who says she agreed to take part in the documentary to 'deconstruct the stigma' of sugar daddy dating, has enjoyed both success and disappointment as part of her experience.

She has been involved in 'mutually beneficial' relationships in Chicago, New York and Florida, and feels that the 'shame' people feel around sex and sex work needs to shift.

Many of the sugar daddies on Seeking Arrangement are 'verified,' which means they have been subject to a full background check and had their high incomes confirmed by their tax returns. 

Still, a number of men Ms Wood has been involved with, she says, either promised money that never appeared, or lead her to 'fear' for her safety; and she now no longer partakes in sugar daddy dating.

Worryingly, the trailer for Daddies Date Babies spotlights several allusions to dark experiences in the anonymous words of its subjects.

'He was really f***ing creepy,' one woman mentions. 'He tried to brainwash me,' claims another. There are also references to '70-year-old white dudes' and men with 'missing teeth.'

One sugar daddy is described as having a habit for going to Japan in search of 'small school girls,' while another woman specifically admits to being raped. 'It's time for things to change. My life needs to change,' the unidentified sugar baby says.

For Stephany Xu however, a 23-year-old self-described entrepreneur, Seeking Arrangement has brought her a wealth, literally, of great experiences over the past five years.

She describes her sugar daddies as being 'nice, knowledgeable and supportive' and references some who have remained 'close mentors' to her, even after their formal arrangement has been dropped.

For Ms Xu, and many other sugar babies, the problem of 'false promises' from sugar daddies can be largely avoided by obtaining the use of his credit card, as an absolute requirement.

'The only way I will accept it working is if I'm given a credit card,' she says. 'My credit line is amazing. I could take out as many mortgages as I want to. I have 14 or 15 cards.'

'The best men get the best girls,' Seeking Arrangement's CEO, Brandon Wade, is quoted as saying in the trailer. 'The men who get the most money, will be the most successful in relationships.'

For Miss Berliet, who sparked the documentary with her uncover piece, Sugar Daddy dating is simply a formalization of the sorts of relationships we see all around us.

'People love to deride sugar daddy dating as 'prostitution,' as if by slapping that label on it, it's automatically a terrible thing,' she says.

'The truth is that there's an economic component to most, if not all, relationships. With sugar daddies and babies, the relationship terms are more overt.

'What's interesting is that many who frown upon the idea of embracing the financial component of a relationship, wear diamond engagement rings. 

'If you don't see an expensive ring as a contract of sorts, you're fooling yourself.'
