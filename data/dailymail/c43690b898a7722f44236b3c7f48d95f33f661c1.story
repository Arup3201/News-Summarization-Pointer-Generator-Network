A quarter of children in the U.S. were born to unmarried couples who live together, according to latest figures.

Unwed mothers accounted for 40 per cent of babies but today new details emerged about the changing shape of the American family.

About 23 per cent of newborns 
were to unmarried heterosexual couples who live together - up from 14 per cent in a 2002 study.

Maybe baby: One in four children in the U.S. was born to unmarried parents who live together, according to the latest data

The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention study was based on interviews with more than 22,000 men and 
women in the U.S. from 2006 to 2010.

The
CDC did not speculate on the reason for the rise but there were 
suggestions that the cost of a wedding - on average $27,000 - in times 
of financial hardship and high unemployment could be a cause.

The study also revealed that men and women who lived with both parents at age 14 were less likely to have had a non-marital birth -  40 to 41 per cent compared with 62 to 64 per cent among those with other living arrangements at  the same age.

There were a record number of births in 
America in 2007 - 4.3 million - but that fell to 4 million in 2010.

The demographic of mothers has changed dramatically over the past two decades.

Women having their first child were 
now older than in the past - with 14 per cent of babies now born to 
mothers aged 35 and older compared to 9 per cent in 1990.

The average age of American mothers who 
had their first baby in 2008 was 25 - a year older than the average 
first-time mother in 1990.
