LIVERPOOL’S CONFIDENCE CRISIS

The defenders have been a bag of nerves. That comes from the pressure of playing for Liverpool and their run of bad results. Last season Kolo Toure was caught up in a number of mishaps — this from a good defender, one of Arsenal’s Invincibles, but he was misunderstood. Liverpool wanted a vocal leader where Kolo leads through performances. Now he has fought back and is playing like the player we expected. Dejan Lovren should take a leaf out of his book. Lovren was excellent for Southampton but looks a different player in Liverpool red. He was signed to answer their defensive prayers but there was no quick fix, it is all about the group. Brendan Rodgers needs to work hard now to restore his confidence.

THE CENTRAL ISSUE

Liverpool are not the only team guilty of this, but too often their full backs don’t tuck in and the centre backs don’t pick up in the box. There are wild clearances and mistimed headers which makes me wonder how often defenders actually practise these things. Goalkeepers spend all week punching and taking crosses —defenders should too. We can be too protective of them when really they need full-blooded training. That way in a match situation you can be confident of clearing your lines.

SELECTION HEADACHES

One of Rodgers’s biggest issues has been picking his best XI. Last season you knew his team would be the same for every game. This time there has been too much change. That creates confusion and makes it hard to build confidence. It’s time for Rodgers to back his players and trust the ones he believes in.

ARSENAL ARE LOSING TOUCH

A feature of the goals conceded by Arsenal this season is allowing opposition players too much freedom in the box. Defending is all about partnerships and on occasions Per Mertesacker has been too detached from his fellow centre backs. When crosses are put in defenders need to be touch tight with the attackers. Not grappling all over them, but aware of their position and within reach so they can put in a block or a tackle. Arsenal have been too loose with that this season.

THE MISSING MAN

The absence of Laurent Koscielny has been a big blow for Arsenal. Over the past two or three years he has grown into one of the best all-round defenders in the league. His mobility is his biggest asset and Arsenal have missed his pace. He seeks out danger and snuffs it out.

SWITCHING OFF

To keep clean sheets, you have to remain focused at all times. Even if the opposition have a throw, you have to deny them space and make sure their wingers don’t get the ball in to feet. At Swansea, Jefferson Montero was allowed to receive the ball to feet and Calum Chambers had little protection in front of him. It’s all about communication between the full back and the midfield to squeeze the space and make sure nobody switches off, even for a second.
