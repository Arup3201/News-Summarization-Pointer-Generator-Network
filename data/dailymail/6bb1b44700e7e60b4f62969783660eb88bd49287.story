After seven eventful years and 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km), the Dawn spacecraft now has the mysterious world of Ceres in its sights.

The unmanned probe is currently 400,000 miles (640,000 km) from the Texas-sized dwarf planet, approaching it at around 450mph (725 km/h).

When it arrives at Ceres in March, it will explore the dirt-covered icy world in the hopes of understanding the history of the early solar system.

After seven eventful years and 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km), the Dawn spacecraft now has the mysterious world of Ceres in its sights. This artist's concept shows the Dawn spacecraft heading toward the dwarf planet Ceres. It is due to arrive at the icy, dirt covered world in March if all of its final manoeuvres go to plan

Its arrival will mark the first time that a spacecraft has ever orbited two solar system targets.

Dawn previously explored the protoplanet Vesta for 14 months, from 2011 to 2012, capturing detailed images and data about that body.

The probe recently emerged from something called 'solar conjunction', in which it was on the opposite side of the sun, limiting communication with Earth.

Now that Dawn can reliably communicate with our planet again, mission controllers have programmed the manoeuvres necessary for the next stage of the rendezvous.

Ceres is 590 miles (950km) across. In January, scientists discovered that water was gushing from its surface

Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system.

Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'.

Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere.

It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform.

Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year.

There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals.

'Ceres is almost a complete mystery to us,' said Christopher Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles.

'Ceres, unlike Vesta, has no meteorites linked to it to help reveal its secrets. All we can predict with confidence is that we will be surprised.'

Astronomers believe Ceres may have formed later than Vesta, and with a cooler interior.

Current evidence suggests that Vesta only retained a small amount of water because it formed earlier, when radioactive material was more abundant, which would have produced more heat.

Ceres, in contrast, has a thick ice mantle and may even have an ocean beneath its icy crust.

Ceres, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km), is also the largest body in the asteroid belt, the strip of solar system real estate between Mars and Jupiter.

Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible

By comparison, Vesta has an average diameter of 326 miles (525km), and is the second most massive body in the belt.

The spacecraft uses ion propulsion to traverse space far more efficiently than if it used chemical propulsion.

In an ion propulsion engine, an electrical charge is applied to xenon gas, and charged metal grids accelerate the xenon particles out of the thruster.

These particles push back on the thruster as they exit, creating a reaction force that propels the spacecraft.

Dawn has now completed five years of accumulated thrust time, far more than any other spacecraft.

'Orbiting both Vesta and Ceres would be truly impossible with conventional propulsion,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director at Nasa.

'Thanks to ion propulsion, we're about to make history as the first spaceship ever to orbit two unexplored alien worlds'

The next couple of months are set to provide improving views of Ceres, prior to Dawn's arrival.

By the end of January, the spacecraft's images and other data will be the best ever taken of the dwarf planet.

Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second.

Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes.

Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life.

Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.'

The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter.
