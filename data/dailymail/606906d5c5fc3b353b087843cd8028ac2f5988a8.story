A woman claims her kidney was stolen by doctors who sold it to traffickers after tricking her into having surgery by saying she had colon cancer.

Xu Xiuying, 48, has been fighting a seven-year battle for compensation after only discovering her organ was missing during a routine X-ray when she complained of backache.

She said: 'I thought it was a result of a genetic defect and assumed I had been born like that, so I didn't think any more of it.'

But when a neighbour alerted her to a scandal involving a trade in stolen kidneys she looked at the matter again.

Xu, who lives in the city of Xiangcheng in central China's Henan province, realised unscrupulous doctors must have removed her healthy organ and sold it on the black market.

Healthy kidneys can be sold for thousands of pounds illegally and a huge investigation has been launched into the trade in China where the illicit operation took place.

Xu, who has found she had two healthy kidneys in 2006 by looking at medical records held by her doctor, was told that she wrongly had colon cancer and faced major operations.

She was admitted to two hospitals over a period of 12 months, undergoing a seven-hour operation in the first.

She had more treatment in the second, but is now unsure when exactly her kidney was stolen.

Xu has been fighting a seven-year battle for compensation, but the courts say they is not enough evidence to prove which of the two hospitals carried out the surgery in which her kidney was stolen

It was during treatment at a third hospital that she discovered it was missing.

She now claims it could only have happened during treatment at either the Xiangcheng First People's Hospital or the Xiangcheng Suburb Hospital.

As neither hospital will admit responsibility, she is having to sue both of them for compensation for her lost kidney. 

A recent offer of a small amount of compensation by the First People's Hospital has been turned down by Xu.

A judicial review confirmed her kidney was removed during surgery and that she was entitled to compensation.

But the courts are refusing to rule on who should pay it because of  lack of evidence over which hospital was to blame.
