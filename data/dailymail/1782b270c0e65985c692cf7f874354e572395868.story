A Phoenix teenager is facing charges after a child he was babysitting was injured last weekend and later died.

Justin Hoskins, 16, is behind bars and being charged as an adult after the five-year-old he was caring for, Ian Blair, was rushed to hospital with severe brain injuries before dying.

Police say the teen originally was arrested Sunday on suspicion of child abuse and may face further charges following the child's death on Wednesday.

Teen babysitter: Justin Hoskins was looking after five-year-old Ian Blair and two other small children when he became enraged and shoved the boy so hard he died later of his injuries

Police were called Sunday night to Phoenix Children's Hospital after the victim's mother says she found her son unresponsive in bed after she got home from work.

The child was airlifted to the hospital in extremely critical condition.

According to AZ Family, the mother of five-year-old Ian, his three-year-old sister and four-month-old brother, left the children in the care of Hoskins, the son of her live-in boyfriend, a frequent occurrence in the household in which both parents worked full-time.

Ian and his sister got in a food fight on the afternoon of May 18, and Hoskins allegedly became angry with the child and sent him to stand in the corner as punishment.

When he refused, Hoskins shoved the boy in the chest so hard that his head buckled back, he lost his balance and he fell over, hitting his head on the ground, according to police.

Court records show that instead of calling for help, Hoskins picked up the unresponsive boy and carried him to his bedroom. He noticed the boy had vomited on himself, but put him in his bed anyway and left him there.

Hoskins's father came home from work and saw that the smaller children were napping and he too took a nap.

Ian Blair's mother came home and looked in on the sleeping children. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, she too took a nap.

At least five hours passed before Ian Blair's mother went to wake the child for dinner and noticed something was terribly wrong.

She found him covered in vomit and urine and couldn't wake him.

According to court documents, Ian was suffering from 'extreme hematoma to the right side of the brain, bilateral retinal hemorrhages, swelling in the eyes and face,' and bruising on his body, reports AZ Family. He was bleeding from his eyes.

Ian Blair was placed on life support and kept alive long enough for his family to say their final goodbyes.

Hoskins gave three different versions of what happened to the child, first claiming ignorance, then blaming the family dog for knocking the boy down and finally admitting to shoving the little boy.

The teen was taken to the Maricopa County Juvenile Detention Center and is facing child abuse charges but could face additional charges now that the little boy is dead.
