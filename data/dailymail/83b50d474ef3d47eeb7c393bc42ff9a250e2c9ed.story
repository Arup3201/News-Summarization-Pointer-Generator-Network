A Utah high school has used Photoshop to censor its yearbook photos because it deemed some female students' pictures too sexy.

Wasatch High School is under fire after it altered the images of certain students to show less skin without them knowing about it.

When the students received the much anticipated yearbook, they were shocked to see they appear to be wearing a different outfit.

A Utah high school has used Photoshop to censor its yearbook photos because it deemed some female students' pictures too sexy

Upset: Sophomore Kimberly Montoya said her shirt 'was a cream color, and the color of the cover-up was completely white. It looked like white-out on my skin'

Some have now complained, and said they also feel upset because the decisions whether to alter the photos or not were not made consistently.

'I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who,' Sophomore Rachel Russel told KSTU-TV.

'There were plenty of girls (who) were wearing thicker tank tops and half of them got edited and half of them didn't.'

Russel's original picture showed her wearing a sleeveless top. But the version seen in the yearbook has black sleeves added on.

Sophomore 
Kimberly Montoya added: 'My shirt was a cream color, and the color of 
the cover-up was completely white. It looked like white-out on my skin.'

The apparently random editing process is what angered the girls the most.

In
 one case, according to the TV station, two different girls were wearing
 nearly identical tops but only one was altered to add sleeves while the
 other was printed as it was.

Students raised the issue with high school administrators, who said the yearbook couldn't be changed after printing.

Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker later defended the general decision to edit images for modesty.

He claimed students know the dress code and there was a sign warning them that their pictures may be altered.

However, Shoemaker admits the school school have taken a more consistent approach.

'We only apologize in the sense that we want to be more consistent with what we're trying to do in that sense we can help kids better prepare for their future by knowing how to dress appropriately for things,' Shoemaker said.

The school district dress code's ban on 'extreme clothing' lists 'revealing shorts, skirts, dresses, tank shirts, halter or crop tops, spaghetti straps, etc.'
