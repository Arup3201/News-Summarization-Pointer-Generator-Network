A couple who ate 5,000 calories a day each and reached a combined weight of 44st went on to lose 13st by following the Hairy Bikers diet.

Samantha Williams, 46, and boyfriend Dave Exelby, 36, both habitually consumed 5,000 calories - the equivalent of ten double cheeseburgers - every day before embarking on a life-changing health kick.

At his heaviest Mr Exelby tipped the scales at just under 26st, while Miss Williams weighed 18st.

The couple lost 13st using the 'Hairy Bikers' diet, swapping their huge portions for low calorie alternatives

The couple, from Goole, East Yorkshire, lost 13st between them by following recipes in The Hairy Dieters cookbook, popularised by Strictly Come Dancing star Dave Myers and fellow Hairy Biker Si King.

Miss Williams said: 'We enjoyed relatively healthy meals most of the time, including roast dinners, pasta, pizza and curry - the problem was the huge quantities we consumed.

'We would dig into massive portions at meal times and indulge in snacks in the meantime.'

Miss Williams and Mr Exelby, who have ten-year-old twins named Georgia and Joseph, were prompted to change their eating habits as they increasingly found daily life exhausting.

Miss Williams said: 'Looking after our twins as they grow up is a full-time job and Joe requires constant care as he is autistic. When we were overweight I wished we were in better shape so we could keep up with them.

Samantha and Dave admit they ate large portions and also indulged in snacks, although they had tried to exercise in the past they had failed to shift the pounds

'We tried exercising to shift the pounds but it had no effect. We used to take our ten-year-old twins swimming but we were far too embarrassed to join a gym.

'The thought of dragging our bodies into a gym packed with slim people was terrifying.'

The couple stumbled across ‘The Hairy Dieters’ cookery show in September 2012.

Miss Williams said: 'We were amazed at how quickly the bikers had lost their bellies and we wondered whether it could work for us.

'Dave turned to me and said: "That’s it. We’re going to give that a go."'

Dave, a lorry driver, found that the type of meals he could easily find on the road were unhealthy

The pair bought the series cookbook the following month and embarked on a strict diet which reduced their calorie intake by a third.

Miss Williams said: 'It wasn’t easy. At first I felt hungry all the time, but gradually I came to enjoy the low-calorie recipes.

'The first dish I attempted from the book was a low-calorie lasagne which used slices of leek instead of pasta sheets. It was delicious.

'For a while it felt as if I was cooking all the time, as I struggled to switch from shoving a frozen pizza in the oven to making a whole meal from scratch.'

Dave's waistline has shrunk from 54in to 38in (left with daughter Georgia), while Samantha (right) says it's lovely to able to shop in the normal sized ranges on the high street now she has lost the weight

Eventually the pair started regularly exercising in a bid to shift the pounds.

'We bought a cross-trainer for the house so we could exercise together at home,' said Miss Williams. 'Dave bought himself a bike, but at first he struggled to cycle half a mile.

Keen fisherman David says he loves their new active lifestyle

'I watched him huffing and puffing along and realised I had never, in the 17 years we had been together, seen him riding a bike.'

Mr Exelby, a lorry driver, found exercise a chore after being stuck behind the wheel for hours at a time for his job. Often the only food readily available to him had been fast food and greasy service station fry-ups.

But today, a year since they started their diet, Mr Exelby weighs 17st after losing an impressive 9st. His waistline has shrunk from 54in to 38in.

He said: 'Now I take healthy meals to work - pasta salad, natural yoghurt flavoured with some ginger, carrot and celery sticks and some low calorie popcorn for my sweet tooth.

'Our lives has changed completely. I feel incredible now. I’m out on my bike all the time. I love our new active lifestyle.

'I cannot wait until we get Joe a three-wheeled bike, so we can all go cycling together as a family - something I never thought would happen.'

Miss Williams said: 'The kids know they can mess around with Dave now and he will chase after them. He can even chase them up the stairs - we could hardly walk up those stairs a year ago.

'We’ve had to replenish our wardrobe several times over the past year too. I love being able to shop in normal high street stores. It’s such a treat not to have to go to the back of the rail, where the XXL sizes hide.

'I have kept just one big coat from when I was really big. I still get it out now - but only as a reminder. I never want to wear that coat again.'
