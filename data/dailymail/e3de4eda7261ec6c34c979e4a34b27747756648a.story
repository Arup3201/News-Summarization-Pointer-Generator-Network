Jailed: Julie Faulkner, 67, tried to smother her mother with a cushion in a row over Christmas dinner in her sheltered accommodation in Blaby, Leicstershire

The daughter of a frail 97-year-old woman smothered her with a pillow for asking to be cooked Christmas dinner, shouting: 'You've lived too long and you're a nuisance.'

Julie Faulkner, 67, has now been jailed for five years for the assault, which almost cost the life of her mother, Connie Goodman.

Mrs Goodman, who suffers from mobility problems but is mentally alert, managed to call for help by pressing an emergency alarm on her bracelet.

Her daughter later confessed to the attempted murder, telling police: 'You try looking after a 97-year-old who is going out of her brains.'

The attack happened on December 23 last year at Mrs Goodman's sheltered accommodation flat in Blaby, Leicestershire.

Leicester Crown Court heard how an argument had broken out between the pair after Mrs Goodman, a grandmother, asked her daughter whether she would be cooking their Christmas dinner or if a carer would be delivering a meal instead.

Faulkner, who had been drinking brandy, reacted angrily, pulling her mother's favourite cushion from behind her head while she was seated and holding it on her face.

She told her mother she was a 'nuisance' and had 'lived too long' but Mrs Goodman managed to activate her emergency bracelet device, which put a call through to a call handler.

The court heard how the person who answered the phone heard the commotion, with Mrs Goodman managing to wriggle free and shouting that she needed the police.

Faulkner then gave up her fight, telling the handler: 'I put a pillow on her head like she asked me to do. Goodnight.'

When later arrested at home, she told officers: 'I only did what she wanted me to. I promised her when it got too bad I'd put a pillow on her face.'

Dawn Pritchard , prosecuting, said Mrs Goodman was shaken and had suffered a cut to her nose. She has asked for her favourite cushion, the attempted murder weapon, to be returned to her.

Locked up: Judge Michael Pert, sitting at Leicester Crown Court, gave Faulkner, 67, five years behind bars

The elderly lady said her daughter was
often drunk, telling officers she had 'made a mess of her life' but had
never hurt her before.

She had a number of carers, including 
her granddaughter and daughter, who visited two evenings a week and 
would often cook her Sunday lunch, which she had done on the day of the 
attack.

Faulkner, also of Blaby, was jailed for five years on Thursday.

Judge Michael Pert said: 'The fact 
your mother was so vulnerable and you were in a position of trust and 
power over her is an aggravating feature.

'The act of trying to smother her was brief and not persisted with. I accept it wasn't planned.'

Alwyn Jones, defending, said the case was a 'tragedy' as the mother and daughter had previously had a strong bond.

He said Faulkner, who had no previous convictions, was remorseful and had described her actions as 'losing control'.

Mr Jones said: 'It wasn't a case of gain and there's no suggestion of any financial motive.'

He said Faulkner's daughter believed 
alcohol problems had affected her mental health and that she struggled 
with the slightest stress.

Mr Jones added: 'She was finding it hard to cope up to and during this incident.

'She admits she had had a brandy, as she would normally during the course of the day.'

The court heard the victim no longer wanted to see her daughter and had changed her locks, but would speak to her on the phone.

Miss Pritchard added: 'She'd like to know why her daughter did this to her. She also wants her favourite cushion back.'
