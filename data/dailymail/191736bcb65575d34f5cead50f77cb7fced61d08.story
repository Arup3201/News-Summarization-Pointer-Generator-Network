The baby gorilla who came down with pneumonia after being born in a rare Caesarean section at the San Diego Zoo has improved enough to begin drinking formula from bottles and to breathe on her own, zoo officials said on Wednesday.

The baby gorilla, a girl, was delivered by C-section on March 13 after its 18-year-old mother, Imani, went into labor at the zoo but was unable to complete the delivery, according to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

'For those who have been following the gorilla closely, you'll notice she's got a lot more hair, and we think that she's really doing well on the formula,' said Nadine Lamberski, associate director of veterinary services at the zoo.

'She's getting a lot of calories, and you can see that she changes every day. She's developing normally and very rapidly," Lamberski added.

The baby, the 17th gorilla delivered at the Southern California zoo, was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and other medication until Tuesday.

The baby also had a collapsed lung that was reinflated and no longer required supplemental oxygen.

'It's pretty obvious that we've been dealing with pneumonia,' Lamberski said.

'It probably occurred at about the time of birth. It's not really clear if it occurred just prior to birth or immediately following birth.'

The baby, an endangered western lowland gorilla , weighed 4.6 pounds on delivery and is a full-term infant.

The gorilla, which has not yet been named, has been drinking human baby formula.

She is now under constant watch by veterinarians at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, who performed the emergency surgery after discovering the collapsed organ during a chest surgery.

The gorilla, who weighed 4.6lbs when she arrived on Wednesday, was born with breathing problems.

‘It's not really clear if it [pneumonia] occurred just prior to birth or immediately following birth, but it's definitely pneumonia and a lot of the conditions that we've been managing since then are all related to pneumonia,’ Nadine Lamberski, veterinarian and associate director of veterinary services at San Diego Zoo, told the LA Times.

On Friday morning veterinarians, a neonatal specialist named Dawn Reeves and an anesthesiologist from the University of California, San Diego Health System performed the life-saving procedure, reports NBC.

NBC reported that after monitoring the baby, they determined that both her lungs were inflated and that the surgery was successful.

However, during the weekend, the baby girl contracted the serious lung infection.

Reeves told the Telegraph that the the baby gorilla is different than human babies because it can grab things with both its hands and feet.

Park officials say that the baby's mother, 18-year-old Imani, went into labor on Wednesday morning and was showing no signs of progress until later that evening.

NBC reports that's when doctors took Imani to the Safari Park veterinary hospital for an emergency operation, with the help of experts in human c-sections.

'In retrospect the c-section was the right decision,' said the park’s Associate Director of Veterinary Services Nadine Lamberski in a release.

'We think the health of the fetus would have been compromised if we delayed the surgery any longer.'

A cesarean delivery, also known as a c-section, is a 'surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision in the mother's abdomen and a second incision in the mother's uterus,' according to mayoclinc.com.

The operation was performed by the talented San Diego Zoo Global team and also by a veterinary surgeon and a neonatal specialist from UC San Diego medical Center.

The Mail Online tried contacting the park for updates on the gorilla's health but no one was available for comment.
