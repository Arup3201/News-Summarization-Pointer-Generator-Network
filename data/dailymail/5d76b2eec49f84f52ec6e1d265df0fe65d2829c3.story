Annmarie Klein knows she's blessed to have survived the tornado that leveled her family's central Illinois home.

She understands most of the things they lost - the Jacuzzi, 60-inch TVs, diamond jewelry, the convertible and other vehicles - can be replaced.

That's not true for a mint green box that contained three cards - to her, 'the most important thing in my house.'

The cards swept away by the November 17 twister that ripped through Washington, Illinois,
were personalized by Klein's brother, Paul McLaughlin, with notes for 
each of his three children before his 2005 death from colon cancer at 
age 39.

Klein said her 
brother, a suburban Boston resident who fought cancer for six years, 
entrusted her to give the cards in sealed envelopes to his kids someday 
'so that when he was gone they could still remember their dad.'

'I feel like I let him down,' an anguished Klein said through tears this week. 'I'd do anything to find those cards.'

The
search has consumed her since the storm bowled into her Tazewell County
town. The separation she's experiencing doesn't surprise Bill Benson, 
administrator of a Facebook group page set up to rejoin folks in the 
county with property that was whirled away.

'These
storms typically have tops of thousands of feet, so theoretically 
things could be lofted up to that height and carried,' said Benson, a 
photojournalist from Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks area. 'I'm sure as 
farmers go to work their fields next spring, things will continue to be 
recovered unless they're buried beneath topsoil.'

Klein
would rather not wait that long, already frayed by the ordeal that 
began the Sunday she saw the tornado zeroing in on her home and raced 
with her husband and children to a basement safe room.

'The kids were screaming. We were screaming,' she said. As the parents shielded the kids, 'we just prayed as a family.'

Seconds
later, there was silence and sunlight. The Kleins, some still in their 
pajamas, emerged through their walkout basement and found their home 
destroyed, the twister having hurled a pickup truck through the living 
room where the family had been just moments earlier.

'There
was that feeling of emptiness, the kind that comes when the kids look 
at you with faces of complete fear,' said Klein, 41.

A
couple of days later, while holed up in her family's hotel room, she 
suddenly remembered the cards her brother gave her. They had been 
individually wrapped in plastic and tucked inside the box.

The
cards were sealed in neon pink and yellow envelopes. Each was 
designated for one of McLaughlin's children - Brendan, Cameron and Erin,
who are now ages 10 to 18.

'My
brother told me, before dying, to give those cards to his kids when the
time is right - their 18th birthday, 21st birthday, the day they got 
married,' Klein said. 'I hadn't really decided when the right time was.'

Even without the cards, 
it's unlikely McLaughlin's kids would ever forget their dad, a man who 
poured himself into raising funds for children's charities, particularly
those benefiting kids with cancer.

McLaughlin,
who worked as a Fidelity Investments software analyst, was a skilled 
hockey player and mentored his children in sports. Not long before his 
death, McLaughlin got a surprise visit from NHL Hall of Famer and former
Boston Bruins player Ray Bourque at the McLaughlin family's Rockland, 
Massachussets, home.

Bourque played hockey in the street with McLaughlin's kids as their dad, weakened by cancer, played goalie in a chair.

Residents of Washington, a downstate town of 15,000, were left to pick up the pieces and begin recovering from the disaster

The storm killed three people in Massac Country, two in Washington County and one in the city of Washington, in Tazewell County

Bits of American flags and insulation from destroyed houses clung to trees that had been stripped of most of their branches and remaining leaves by the twister

'I'm
lucky,' Boston Herald columnist Mike Barnicle quoted McLaughlin as 
saying in chronicling the day. 'I've had a wonderful life, a beautiful 
family, three great kids, my own home.'

It
was a bright spot for the family's life, and now Klein wants to find 
those cards to ensure that McLaughlin's children have something more 
from their father to hold dear.

Strangers have joined her search.

While
helping with Washington's tornado cleanup, Illinois Wesleyan University
women's golf coach Kathy Niepagen spotted Klein desperately searching 
her property, looking for the cards.

'I
felt so bad for this lady. She had such despair in her eyes, and she 
didn't care about anything else,' Niepagen recently recalled. 'I just 
gave her a hug, walked away and said, `Let's see what we can do.''

Niepagen
turned to Facebook, posting on the Benson-run 'Tazewell County Document
& Photograph Recovery' group page an appeal for anyone 'from 
Washington to Chicago' to be on the lookout for the cards. More than 
25,000 Facebook users, some as far away as North Carolina, had shared 
Niepagen's posting on their pages as of Wednesday.

Klein
said she just revealed to her brother's widow this week that the cards 
are missing. She said her sister-in-law told her she understood and 
forgave her.

'I believe 
we're going to find them,' said Klein, who's Catholic and said she prays
to Saint Anthony, the finder of lost things. 'I have faith.'
