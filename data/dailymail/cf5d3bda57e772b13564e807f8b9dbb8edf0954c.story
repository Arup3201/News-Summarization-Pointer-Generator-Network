Dull is a tiny Scottish village with barely 20 homes; Boring is a US town of 10,000, which proudly boasts two golf courses and its own brewery.

But the two communities, which sit more than 4,500 miles apart, are today celebrating perhaps the only feature they have in common - their uninteresting names.

After teaming up in 2012, the governor of Oregon declared Saturday, August 9 as a public holiday across the entire state - which would be known as Boring and Dull Day.

The farming communities of Boring, Oregon and Dull, Scotland partnered up in June 2012 in an effort to boost tourism

Boring has around 8,000 residents and Dull has only about 80. Both are farming communities

Boring commemorated the first 'Boring and Dull' state holiday last year with an ice cream social in the local park, something they plan on doing again this year

This year, the Americans are celebrating the public holiday with free ice cream in the park and a piper, who is appropriately playing 
Highland music.

Nobody from Dull was able to travel from Scotland to represent the village, 
but Boring will share the celebrations with its friend by 
posting photos on their Facebook page.

Steve Bates, chairman of the Boring Community Planning Organisation, told the Telegraph: 'Unfortunately nobody could coincide a visit to mark the day.'

'We are having free ice cream in the park. We will also have a bagpiper playing Highland music. He was trained in Oregon.

'We had also hoped to have the Sir 
James McDonald Pipe Band from Portland, but they are over in Scotland 
taking part in a competition.'

The two places teamed up last year in a canny effort to boost tourism and combat the notion that their namesakes define them.

The decision meant both places can sell novelty tourist items, get quirky road signs made and plan exchange visits.

But the difference in size between Boring and Dull meant they could not officially become twin towns

Boring is located about 20 miles southeast of Portland. It has two golf courses and a few restaurants, as well as brewery. But the town has no movie theaters, grocery stores or hotels

Dull is located about 75 miles north of Glasgow and has only 20 homes

Boring is located about 20 miles 
southeast of Portland. It has two golf courses and a few restaurants, as
 well as brewery for its 7,500 residents. But the town has no movie 
theaters, grocery stores or hotels.

Dull is similar but much smaller. The Scottish town is located about 75 miles north of Glasgow and has only 20 homes.

Dull is believed - although it is not
 confirmed - to have got its name from the leather straps used to carry 
coffins in Scotland.

The idea for a partnership came from a Dull resident who stumbled on Boring during a trip from Flagstaff, Arizona to Seattle. A church in Dull is pictured

Boring got its name from William Boring who moved to the area after the American civil war.

The idea for a partnership came from a Dull resident who stumbled on Boring during a trip from Flagstaff, Arizona to Seattle. 

She took a photo of the Boring town sign and sent it to a friend back home in Dull, with a message jokingly suggesting that the towns should pair up. 

Her friend, Emma Burtles, then took the idea to a meeting of the Dull women's book club, and before long, leaders from each town were in contact discussed the possibility of a partnership, according to a 2012 story in The Oregonian.
