A stunning video of Dartmoor National Park in south Devon has captured all four seasons in just eight minutes.

Dartmoor Time-Lapse, produced by photographers Alex Nail and Guy Richardson, squeezes in a whole year of beautiful scenery.

It includes colourful sunsets, fast-flowing waterfalls and a dramatic shot of a silvery moon disappearing behind Brent Tor.

The breath-taking footage has already been sold to Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) and will be shown at popular tourist centres.

But an argument over the music score has to be settled before the film can be distributed elsewhere and it could be deleted within weeks due to copyright issues.

The two photographers, both 27, had to use special cameras set on mobile mounts - but have said they will not be repeating the exercise any time soon.

‘We spent literally hundreds and hundreds of hours out on the moors - and it would be difficult for me to do it again as I am also an engineer working in Bristol,’ Alex said.

Guy, from Exeter, Devon, said: ‘It really was a work of love.

‘It's not so difficult for me to get up on the moors because I work near Bovey Tracey - but it does take so much time and time-lapse photography is so dependent on the weather.

A Dartmoor visitor manager said that the footage showed Dartmoor as ‘it's never been seen before’

‘One shot can take hours. For example, you might be photographing bluebells in spring when a wind suddenly starts to blow.

That would be hopeless because, with time-lapse, the whole carpet of bluebells would end up looking like just one big blue blur.’

Despite the copyright issues the film is already getting a lot of attention.
