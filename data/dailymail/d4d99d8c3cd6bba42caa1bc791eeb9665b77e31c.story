'Critical but stable': Nelson Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to the office of President Jacob Zuma

A lawyer acting for the family of Nelson Mandela is facing disciplinary action for allegedly overstating the seriousness of the former freedom fighter's health to fast track a court hearing.

David Smith, acting for Mr Mandela's oldest daughter Makaziwe, his wife Graca Machel and ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, told a closed court that the former statesman is in a 'permanent vegetative state' and said doctors had recommended his life-support be switched off.

It moved a judge to bring 
forward a hearing into whether the bodies of three of Mandela's children
should be exhumed and reburied at a family grave two years after they were removed to a different site by his grandson Mandla.

While he made the claim on June 26, it 
was only leaked to the media last week, sending shockwaves across the world and prompting an old friend of 
Mandela, Denis Goldberg, to speak out saying he had visited him and that he 'responds 
to voices and tried to speak'.

Now Mandla claims he was given no
notice of the court hearing because of the request for urgency and was 
therefore unable to attend to defend his position, the Daily Telegraph reported.

He says he plans to file a complaint against David Smith and is even considering bringing a case of perjury against Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for allowing the 'exaggeration' in court.

'My client is deeply upset,' said his lawyer Gary Jensen. 'He respects the wishes 
of his grandfather and he didn't want this private family issue to be aired 
so publicly in a court but the applicant chose that route and won their case 
through devious means.'

Nelson Mandela is expected to share the new grave with his children when he passes away.

The news comes as Mandela completed one month in hospital with a lung infection.

As he lay in his hospital bed, well-wishers from around South Africa visited his home to lay cards and flowers at a shrine that has appeared there in recent days.

Family strife: Mandla Mandela lost a court battle last week against 16 members of his family who accused him of moving the bodies of three of the former South African president's children without their permission

Mandla lost a court battle last week 
against 16 members of his family who accused him of moving the bodies of
three of the former South African president's children without their 
permission.

A Mthatha court ruled that the remains should be moved back to the family graveyard in Qunu, the Eastern 
Cape.

The family took Mandla to court after he reburied the remains in his birthplace of Mvezo in 2011.

The Mandela relatives claimed that he had not sought permission or even informed family members when he did so.

Nelson Mandela, who was hospitalized on June
8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to the office of
President Jacob Zuma, who has made regular visits to the anti-apartheid leader in recent weeks, reporting on his health.

Also last week, a close friend of Mandela contradicted the court reports that he was ‘totally conscious’ when he visited him in hospital this week.

Denis Goldberg, a white anti-apartheid activist and stalwart of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), contradicted that medical opinion presented in court, which stated that Mandela has been in a ‘vegetative state’ for the last nine days and his family had discussed switching off his life support machine.

Goldberg, who was jailed for 22 years during the infamous Rivonia trial of 1964 that saw Mandela imprisoned for life, insisted that he had visited Mandela on Monday and he that ‘he is clearly a very ill man, but he responds to voices and tries to talk.’

He added: ‘He was dozing when I got 
there. I spoke and told him who I was and he opened his eyes and looked 
at me. I spoke to him for about ten minutes and he responded positively 
to what I was saying. He was aware of who I was.'
