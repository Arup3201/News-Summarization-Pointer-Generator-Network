Mr Osborne was rushed from his apartment in Ontario, Canada, to hospital after suffering a stab wound to his sternum.

The stab victim, from Ontario, Canada, said: 'I heard him having an argument with someone in his apartment on Wednesday and went round to make sure everything was okay.

'I was telling him: 'There is no need for you to be freaking out about World of Warcraft - it's just a game.'

'But he kept fighting with a friend who was visiting and some other players over a headset. He told me: 'It's not just a game, it's my life.'

Furious: Mr Osborne said his neigbour told him 'Warcraft is my life' when he tried to stop the online row

'I was sitting in my house today thinking I could be dead - and it's all over a World of Warcraft game. It's true, it takes over your life.'

Mr Osborne, who was rushed to 
Peterborough Regional Health Centre, later told Canadian newspaper the Peterborough Examiner: 'The doctor said he could fit his whole finger in
my chest.

'If it had been a little further over, it could have hit my heart or my lungs.'

Williams is charged him with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon, police said.
