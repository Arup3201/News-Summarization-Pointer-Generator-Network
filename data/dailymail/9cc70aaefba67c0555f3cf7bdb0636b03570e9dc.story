A woman in China leapt into a river in a wedding dress in a bid to appease a water god she believes took her son.

Yun Teng, 30, plunged into the river in Suzhou city in eastern China's Anhui province after her son went missing near its banks.

Police said she had been 'driven to the brink of madness' by her loss. There were no leads as to the missing boy's whereabouts and no body has been found, but the woman was convinced he had been claimed by the river.

Desperation: Police officer Zhang Cheng pulls Yun Teng from the water after she leapt in wearing a wedding dress in a desperate attempt to get the spirit of the river to release her son, who she believed it had taken

'It is all very sad,' said a police 
spokesman. 'She convinced herself that she had angered a river god and 
that he would only be appeased if she offered herself as his bride, so 
he would free her son and return him to the world.'

Ms Yun lost her five-year-old son several weeks ago and has since returned to the river day after day to search for him.

Her grief and sorry finally led to desperation earlier this week when she leapt from a bridge over the river.

Police officer Zhang Cheng was among those who witnessed her attempted suicide. He pulled her to a small boat and called firemen for help.

'She was struggling, shouting that she wanted to be left there and claimed by the river, and that it was the only way the "river god" was going to let her son return to dry land,' he said.

'It is hard to save someone when they don't want to be rescued because she was very strong. But we managed to subdue her in the end.'

Ms Yun was in the water for half an hour before she was plucked to safety and ferried to the riverbank where emergency services took her to hospital.

The body of her son has been found and he might not even have been lost in the river - thousands of Chinese parents face a similar anguish and uncertainty each year when their children are actually stolen.

In 2011, Chinese police rescued 8,660 abducted children, but it is likely that at least double that number were kidnapped.

China does not release official figures on child trafficking, so estimates are based on the numbers of missing-child reports posted by parents online and of children reported rescued each year.

Estimates range from 10,000 kidnapped per year to as high as 70,000. Most parents who lose children stand very little chance of seeing them again.

Often the children are kidnapped to be sold on to someone else for adoption or sometimes they are forced into prostitution.

At the national level, China takes child abduction very seriously. It has a national anti-kidnapping task force that investigates and infiltrates trafficking rings, and there are frequent anti-kidnapping campaigns that encourage citizens to report anything suspicious.

But at local level, where the first, crucial reports will be made when a child goes missing, many parents say the police just do not seem to care.
