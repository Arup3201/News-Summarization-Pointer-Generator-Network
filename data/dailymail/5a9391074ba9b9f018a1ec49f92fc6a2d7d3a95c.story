At a towering 308 metres high, the glass-clad Shard in south-east London is already Europe's tallest building.

Now the tower's Aqua restaurant is to offer a lofty experience of its own and has launched an afternoon tea eaten with birds-eye views of the surrounding city.

The tea, which costs £29.50, includes smoked salmon and caviar sandwiches, Shard opera cake and chocolate truffles.

For an extra £10.50, you can upgrade to a champagne tea, complete with a bubbling glass of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label champagne.

The newly launched afternoon tea is the latest in a series of luxury teatime experiences offered in the capital.

Although the Ritz Hotel's offering is the best-known, a number of other hotels, including the Savoy, the Goring and the Corinthia, offer their own versions.

At the Ritz, prices for the tea, which includes freshly-baked scones with clotted cream and jam, starts at £45 for a booze-free experience or £59 should you plump for champagne.

Outside the capital, afternoon teas are to be had at some of the country's best hotels, including a £26.50 version served up at Belfast's Merchant Hotel and a £25 offering recommended by the Tea Guild at Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel.

Palatial: The beautiful Woburn Abbey, the seat of the Dukes of Bedford, where afternoon tea was invented

Regardless of where you choose to eat it, few things are more quintessentially British than an afternoon tea, a tradition that dates back more than 150 years.

Credit for introducing the tea is usually handed to Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, who complained that the contemporary habit of serving dinner at 9pm left her hungry in the afternoon.

In a bid to stave off the hunger pangs, she would order tea, bread and butter, and cakes to be served to her at around 4pm in her sumptuous bedroom at her palatial Bedfordshire home, Woburn Abbey.

Eventually, the duchess began to ask her friends to join her and in the process, turned indulging in an afternoon tea into a British tradition.
