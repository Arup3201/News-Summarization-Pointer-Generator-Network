Victoria Quibell-Smith, 30, wreaked revenge on her husband by trashing her marital home in Cwmbran, South Wales

A spurned wife wreaked revenge on her husband by trashing her marital home after she was ordered out by his family.

Victoria Quibell-Smith, 30, caused £7,300 damage in a wrecking spree at her house after splitting up with husband Paul.

She even roped in her children to scribble on the walls. 

Quibell-Smith started destroying the inside of the house in the quiet suburban street in Cwmbran, south Wales, after father-in-law Roger Smith gave her notice to leave.

Quibell-Smith then damaged all the couple's prized personal possessions and decor at the property.

Prosecutor Gareth James said: 'He found smashed glass littering the floor, cigarette ends and ash were scattered in a bedroom - and with rooms smelling of urine.

'She had let her children write on the house’s walls with red pen.'

Quibell-Smith wrote on the wall herself but tried to make out that it had been done by an infant by drawing with her left hand.

Removals man Dale Cronin, who was called to collect her belongings, said in a statement that he had never seen a house in 'such a disgusting state'.

He said: 'It was dirty, minging and smelled.'

Mother-of-two Quibell-Smith lived in the house owned by her father-in-law while she was married to his son.

Newport Crown Court heard when the marriage ended Quibell-Smith left her former father-in-law with a £7,304.44 repair bill.

Among the personal items she wrecked were five of her ex-husband’s sports cigarette cards, each worth £150.

Other pictures worth £600 were also damaged.

Quibell-Smith, now of Ystrad Mynach, near Caerphilly, pleaded guilty to damaging property.

Judge Tom Crowther told her: 'You embarked on a campaign of deliberate destruction in the house. You are richly deserving of a custodial sentence.'

But he said her protests that she was the sole carer for her children was the only reason she would not be sent to prison.

Quibell-Smith was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

But she must pay her ex-husband £1,250 compensation for destroying his possessions after the court heard the damage was covered by insurance.
