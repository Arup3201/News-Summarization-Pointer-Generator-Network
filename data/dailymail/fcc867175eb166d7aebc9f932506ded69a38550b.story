A stag weekend reveller suffered serious burns in a seafront nightclub after being doused in Brut aftershave and set ablaze in a prank, it was claimed today.

The 34-year-old victim was drinking with friends when they started throwing the aftershave over each other as a joke at Long John’s Showbar on Britannia Pier in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

One of the men then lit a lighter and his friend’s T-shirt, which was soaked with the aftershave, burst into flames. The fireball was put out by his horrified friends who rolled him on the floor.

Bar staff also rushed to help with wet
 towels at 1.30am on Sunday. But the victim was left with serious burns 
to his chest, back and hands in the incident

He
 was taken to James Paget Hospital in nearby Gorleston-on-Sea, and 
later transferred to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in 
Chelmsford, Essex.

The 
unnamed man was in a stable condition today with serious, but not 
life-threatening burns. It is believed that the burns will leave him 
scarred for life and potentially needing plastic surgery.

Four
 of the victim’s friends, aged 24, 26, 28, 33, were arrested and taken 
into custody, but were later released on police bail pending further 
inquiries.

Norfolk Police 
confirmed that all of the group came from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, 
and were known to each other. It is believed that they were in Great 
Yarmouth on a weekend away together.

Britannia
 Pier manager Keegan Snell, 40, said: ‘The whole incident was filmed on 
our CCTV. It showed these guys throwing aftershave over each other.

‘One of them put a lighter to his friend’s back and he went up like a fireball. It looked like his whole body was on fire.

The victim and the four arrested men are all from the Sheffield area and are believed to have been in Great Yarmouth for a weekend away

‘His
 friends and other members of the public put him to the floor quickly 
and were trying to roll him to put out the fire. Our staff brought wet 
towels to help.

‘Security staff ran over thinking there was a fight, but it was nothing like that and they helped him as well.

‘It
 was just laddish behaviour which went very badly wrong and it was all 
over in about 30 seconds. His friends were in tears over what happened.

‘There
 were four or five of us helping him to an ambulance. He could walk but I
 don’t think he would have been able to on his own.

‘As
 we were going down the pier, he had a T-shirt over his head and he was 
crying and screaming. He was in a lot of pain and distress. The 
ambulance got him away pretty quickly.’

Mr
 Snell said his staff later found the bottle of splash-on Brut on the 
floor and handed it to police along with CCTV film of the prank.

He
 added: ‘There was no fight. It was just friends playing a prank which 
went horribly wrong.

'Joke': The man was doused in Brut aftershave (file picture) and set ablaze in a prank, it was claimed

'Our thoughts are with the fella who got badly 
burned and his friends who are distraught. We wish him a speedy 
recovery.’

The nightclub was packed with around 450 people when the incident happened.

One
 witness, who was buying drinks at the bar, said: ‘Out the corner of my 
eye I saw flames - at first thinking it was just a T-shirt alight then 
realising it was a guy on fire from his chest up, flames spreading 
towards his head.

‘He 
started to slow drop to the ground with people patting him but the fire 
wasn’t going out. The music was still playing and nothing stopped.

‘It smelled like a burning skin smell for ages and the place was full of smoke from him too.’

A
 Norfolk Police spokesman said: ‘Police received a call at about 1.30am 
following reports of a disturbance involving a group of men at Long 
John’s Bar.

‘It is understood that a 34 year old, who was at the bar, was set alight. He suffered serious burns to his hands and torso.

‘Police
 can confirm that all the individuals involved, including the victim, 
are known to one another and this is being treated as an isolated 
incident with no wider threat to the community.’
