A  woman who allegedly scammed a business out of nearly $100,000 and used it to go on a luxury round-the-world cruise was caught when the ship docked in Australia.

Wendy Janine Baulch, from Maryborough, north of Brisbane, appeared at the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday after she was charged with fraud and computer hacking.

The 52-year-old allegedly gained access to the unnamed business through a phishing scam email which provided her access to the company's funds.

Police said she used the $93,000 she took to pay for a flight to Florida in the United States and a ticket for a luxury cruise from Miami to Sydney.

Baulch had allegedly booked a second leg of the journey and was due to depart from Sydney to Myanmar (Burma) in South-East Asia on February 11.

But her international trip was cut short on Tuesday when she was arrested by NSW police as the cruise docked in Sydney - prior to departing on its journey.

During her bail application, duty lawyer Howard Posner said the allegations seemed to show Baulch was a minor player in a larger criminal group.

'The proposition is that she was a small cog in a large machine and a mule, but that she dipped her fingers into that till more than she should have done,' Mr Posner said.

'It's not that she spent her ill-gotten gains; it's that she stole from the thieves.' 

She appeared at NSW Local Court before being extradited by Queensland Police Service's Fraud and Cyber Crime Group on Thursday.

Police opposed her bail on the grounds she was a flight risk but Magistrate Wendy Cull agreed to release her from custody on condition she surrender her passport and report weekly to police.

Her case has been adjourned until March 16.
