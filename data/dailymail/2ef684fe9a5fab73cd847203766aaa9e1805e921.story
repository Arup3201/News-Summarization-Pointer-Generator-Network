He may not have won Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot, but Warren Buffett probably doesn't care.

The investing genius made an eye-popping $37 million a day in 2013 - that's $1.5 million an hour - simply watching the shares in his conglomerate soar by more than 25 per cent.

The Berkshire Hathaway boss' net worth bounced $12.7 billion to $59.1 billion over the period, making him the billionaire who made the most cash this year, according to a new survey.

Battling it out: Warren Buffett, left, made $37million a day in 2013 - that's $1.5million an HOUR - bringing his eye-popping net worth to $59billion but Bill Gates, right, still tops the list of the world's richest people

But even with his staggering money-making, Buffett, who lives a notoriously humble existence despite his billions, only came second on the list of the world's Top 10 richest people, compiled by Wealth-X.

Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates took the top spot for another year, with a total net worth of $72.6 billion, up from $61.1 billion in 2012.

Gates' impressive gain saw him come second to Buffett in the gains stakes, and in third place was casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who's worth an estimated $35.3 billion this year after raking in $11.4 billion from his gambling houses in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore.

Big year: Amazon's Jeff Bezos's $11.3 billion in earnings snatched him fourth place while Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg added $10.5 billion to make up a now staggering $24.7 billion net worth and take fifth spot

According to Wealth-X, the top 10 collectively gained $101.8 billion in 2013, an average gain of $10.2 billion each.

The combined wealth of the 10 individuals now totals a gob-smacking $347 billion, up from $245 billion in January 2013.

Per day, they made $29 million on average, and increased their wealth by 41.6 per cent, outperforming the 24 per cent returns seen in the S&P 500.
