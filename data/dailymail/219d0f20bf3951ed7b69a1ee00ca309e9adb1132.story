Even a year after the birth of her second child, Amy Middleton says she looked as though she was still pregnant

A mother-of two who says she still looked pregnant a year after giving birth has lost three stone in four months - thanks to raspberry diet pills.

Amy Middleton, 34, dreaded having to get dressed up after giving birth to her second child.

She'd had no problem getting back to a size 10 after the birth of her first child, Archie, three years ago.

But after having her daughter Hattie 18 months later, her 'mummy tummy' simply wouldn't shift.

Instead, she remained at her peak weight of 13 stone for more than a year, despite trips to the gym three times a week.

She believes she was a victim of 
‘second baby syndrome’ whereby it is far harder to shift excess fat from
 the abdomen because a woman’s stomach muscles are weakened by the 
rigours of giving birth in quick succession.

Amy, who lives with her husband Tom and children in Southwick, near Brighton, said: ‘I had two children quite quickly.

‘I
 had always prided myself on staying in shape and having a great figure 
but after the second birth there was nothing I could do to shift my 
mummy tummy.

‘My stomach muscles just weren’t 
the same – I just didn’t have the power there to keep all the excess fat
 tucked up. It was classic “second baby syndrome.”

‘I think your body changes so much by having children so quickly together.’

She added: ‘It was also hard to be really disciplined when I had two small kids to look after.

‘I would be snacking quite a bit during the day because there wasn’t time always to eat healthily.

‘My stomach was still protruding and I
 was not at all happy with my figure. I couldn’t bear to go on nights 
out because I feared someone at a bar or club would say, “When is the 
baby due?” – even though I’d given birth nearly a year before.

‘All my friends would still be wearing their tight going-out clothes and I was wearing loose baggy tops to cover my tummy.

‘I didn’t feel sexy at all. I started to get really depressed and feared that I might not ever get my figure back again.’

Amy had read about how Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey had both used Raspberry Ketone diet pills to keep in shape in the U.S.

Raspberry ketones are fragrant compounds that occur naturally in raspberries and a number of other fruits.

They were hailed as a ‘miracle’ diet cure after being featured on the popular U.S. medical show Dr Oz – and immediately sold out across the U.S. and Canada.

They are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising.

It is believed the pills may also boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism. Higher levels of this hormone are associated with fewer fat stores.

Amy, who took Forza Raspberry Ketones, claims they had an immediate effect and within four months of taking them she had shifted her dreaded ‘mummy tummy’ and lost three stone in weight.

She went down from 13 stone to her current weight of ten stone and switched from a size 14  to size 10. Her waist measurement shrunk from 34 inches to 30. 

She was so proud of her new figure that she posed in her favourite bikinis a few weeks later.

She says she now feels like a 'completely new woman'. I don’t have to worry about anyone asking if I am still pregnant!,' she said.

She added: ‘There is no doubt that the pills made all the difference. I had tried everything to shift my “mummy tummy” and at one point was going to the gym three times a week.'

‘But it was so difficult to diet and bring up the kids properly at the same time and I need a bit of extra help.

‘The pills only work really effectively if you combine them with exercise and a good diet – but they give me the impetus to get all elements of my life into order.

‘I don’t drink tea or coffee so I would really notice the energy boost when I took them. It was nothing strong – just a little pep up.

'But it was especially what I needed – particularly in the afternoons which were the time of day when I would have starting snacking.’

Amy’s confidence surged as she got back to her ideal weight.

She explained: ‘I was losing around 4lbs a week. The weight just steadily came off and after four months I had shed three stone and all my excessive baby weight. My dreaded “mummy tummy” had gone.

‘It was so great to have my flat 
stomach back. I was confident enough to wear my tiny spaghetti strap 
bikini on holiday in Egypt this Christmas.’

Amy, a self-employed business manager, is still not being complacent.

She
 said: ‘Now that I am close to my target weight I am still taking one 
Raspberry Ketone a day. It helps to keep everything on an even keel.’

Her husband Tom, a regional manager with a firm of estate agents, is thrilled that his wife has all her old zip back.

Amy said: 'I’m back wearing all my old tight tops on my nights out with the girls.'
