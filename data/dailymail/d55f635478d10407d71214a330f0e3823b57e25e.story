Banned: The memoir of Malala Yousafzai, pictured, will be banned in 40,000 private Pakistani schools

Education officials in Pakistan have banned the memoir of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager shot by the Taliban, from 40,000 schools as she 'represents the West'.

Adeeb Javedani, president of the All 
Pakistan Private Schools Management Association, said his group had banned the book from the libraries of all affiliated schools.

He said Malala, 16, was representing the West, not Pakistan.

The memoir, called I Am Malala, was written by the teenager with British journalist Christina Lamb.

The book details her extraordinary story and her continued role as an activist.

When she was just 14 years old, Malala was wounded by masked gunmen who singled her out as she returned home in a school bus in Pakistan’s north-west Swat Valley.

She was targeted by the Taliban after speaking out against atrocities committed under the regime in October 2012.

According to Malala's friend Shazia, speaking to the Christian Science Monitor a few days after the shooting, a group of militants riding on a bike stopped the bus carrying the schoolgirls.

The masked men then boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls, asking for Malala.

Attack: The teenager, pictured recovering in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan in October of last year

According to the girl, a hooded Taliban 
militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala?

'Speak up, otherwise I 
will shoot you all. She is propagating against the soldiers of Allah, 
the Taliban. She must be punished.'

The militant then recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range, the girl said.

Malala was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since made the UK her permanent home.

The shooting horrified people in Pakistan and internationally and sparked worldwide condemnation.

Malala has become an international hero for opposing the Taliban and standing up for girls' education.

But conspiracy theories have flourished in Pakistan that her shooting was staged to create a hero for the West.

Last month Malala, accompanied by her father Ziauddin, gave the Queen a copy of her book during their meeting in the palace's White Drawing Room.

She told her: 'It is a great honour for me to be here, and I wanted to present you with this book.'

Accepting the gift, the Queen replied: 'That's very kind of you.'

Malala told the Queen she was passionate about every child having a right to an education, everywhere around the world.

She added: 'Especially in this country as well. I have heard about many children that can't go to school, and I want to continue our work.'
