Drawings done by a neglected five-year-old boy who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police in Adelaide reveal the extent of his trauma.

A court heard his mother was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, who almost starved to death in the filthy room he was locked in by his parents for nearly two weeks.

The boy, now in foster care, is still struggling to cope after the abuse he suffered and is distressed by normal tasks like drawing, Channel Ten News reported.

Drawings done by a neglected five-year-old boy in Adelaide show he is struggling to cope with basic tasks

The boy, then four years old,  weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police

He has learning difficulties and has been held back in kindergarten where he gets bullied and called a 'baby' by other children.

The boy's 24-year-old mother told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler.

The child, then four years old, was only days away from death when he was found naked and crouched on the floor, the Adelaide District Court heard on Tuesday.

Police only happened to find the malnourished, dehydrated and shivering boy when his mother called police to the Adelaide home complaining she had been assaulted by the boy's father.

In a handwritten letter penned by boy's father to his mother, he apologised for his abuse

The mother said she has 'messed up'.

'I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son,' she said.

'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with (her partner).'

The court also heard that the mother had miscarried and earlier pregnancy after she was physically assaulted by the father, who kicked her in the stomach.

In a handwritten letter penned by the father to the mother, he apologised for his abuse.

'I can’t take any of the s*** I’ve put you threw [sic] back, you have no idea how much I wish I could,' he wrote.

‘The one person who tried to help me (you) has coped [sic] mistreatment, foul language, violence and distance and for all of this I am sorry.’

The court also heard the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom, Channel Nine News reported. 

While the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert.

Prosecutors have called for significant jail sentences after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother have pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering the life of their son.

The District Court was told the parents had been on a binge of alcohol and cannabis and had fed the boy yoghurt, custard or jelly on plates they slid under the door.

Officers had to walk through garbage bags, rotting food, dirty nappies and sanitary pads to get to the boy, who was surrounded by used nappies, plastic plates and his own faecal matter.

'He (was) a whisper of a child and, on the prosecution case, only a couple of days away from certain death if the officers had not intervened,' Ms Boord said.

Police had to wade through rubbish when they were called to the home last year to deal with a domestic incident

A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, said he now hides food in his pockets and has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed.

For the first six months he was in care, he refused to leave his bedroom. 

He's still being toilet-trained, has limited language skills, cries and whimpers in his sleep and normal family outings are obviously new to the boy. 

He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls.

The court was told that when arrested, the mother weighed 38kg and the father 39kg.

The boy was locked in his room and fed under his door. He weighed 8.3kg when discovered

The mother's lawyer, Tim Heffernan, said no-one in the household was receiving proper care. There was no routine, no day or night, and his client - who had a terrible upbringing - was subjected to domestic violence.

Although she loved her son, 'she was clearly incapable of organising her life or caring for the child'.

The man's lawyer, Mark Twiggs, said his client was appalled by his actions and was extremely sorry.

Years earlier, Victorian authorities had removed another child from the father's care.

The couple will be sentenced on December 11.
