After the semi-final we perhaps feared we may get after the astonishing events of Tuesday in Belo Horizante, there will now be one overwhelmingly satisfied team left in Brazil. That team is called Germany.

Not only will Joachim Low and his players have an extra day to prepare for Sunday's final against Argentina, they will head to Rio knowing that they will have more than that advantage in their legs.

While the Germans played for just 45 minutes competitively in beating Brazil - as odd as that sounds - Sunday's opponents have been through the wringer here, physically and emotionally.

What Germany will also perhaps be aware of is they are beginning to look by far the superior team.

Here in Sao Paulo on Wednesday night, we got the semi-final from hell. With Holland sticking to their modus operandi and showing a typical unwillingness to engage consistently with Argentina, this was a game that - to invoke an old cliche - needed an early goal to liven it up.

In fact, the longer it went on it just needed a goal. Any old goal.

It was, in truth, awful and Germany will have watched in their hotel realising they have little to fear ahead of their date at the Maracana.

The final will not be one-sided. They never are. This World Cup has had its one freakish can-you-believe-it moment and Brazil were the victims.

Germany, though, have shown themselves to be the outstanding team in this tournament. More pertinently, they are one remaining team that can claim to have improved as they have gone along.

Germany have a midfield that has functioned brilliantly from the opening game and have talented players on the bench who are in form. They have the competition's best goalkeeper, a defensive unit that is imperfect but stable and have a capacity to score goals from all positions.

Not phased: Louis van Gaal's Holland endured a tough opening period but held it together

Holland started with a bewildering 5-1 defeat of Spain in Salvador and kept on surprising people. Late goals have become their speciality and here last night they almost did it again.

They had been second best for large parts of the 90 minutes of normal play but would have won it at the death had Javier Mascherano somehow not stretched out a leg to deny Arjen Robben when he seemed set to score from an angle. Immediately afterwards, Mascherano succumbed to cramp. It was that type of tackle.

Holland, though, have stopped getting better and so, we must say, have finalists Argentina.

Having been guided through this World Cup - on and off the field - by Lionel Messi, the South Americans arrived here without their other in-form player, Angel di Maria.

They missed the Real Madrid forward and on Sunday they will miss him again. Certainly on this occasion, Messi could not do it on his own.

An early free-kick briefly threatened to bother Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen. In the second period of extra time, meanwhile, a run down the right fashioned a chance at the far post for Maxi Rodriguez but it wasn't taken.

Tied up: Holland's great attacking threat Arjen Robben was restricted to just six touches in the first half

Danger man: Argentina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi emerged as the most imposing threat on the pitch early on

But Messi was actually jeered by the crowd here with 20 minutes of normal time left when his over hit free-kick ballooned out of play. That summed up his evening. In fact, it summed up everybody’s evening.

Argentina's best player was actually the PSG forward Ezequiel Lavezzi. It was the former Naples wide player who troubled Holland the most.

In central defender Ron Vlaar, however, Holland had the game’s stand out performer and it was his effort, allied to the Dutch team's usual discipline and organisation, that got them through to the shoot-out.

During the extra time period, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted that Vlaar had contributed the best defensive performance of the tournament.

That the Aston Villa defender was asked to take Holland’s first kick in the shoot-out, though, was peculiar. Was that Louis van Gaal’s first big mistake of the tournament?

Right stuff: Dirk Kuyt (left) was immense at wing-back and Argentina played away from him

Close quarters: Nigel de Jong (centre left) was never far from Lionel Messi, though Lavezzi put him in two minds

It seemed so, given that specialist Klaas Jan Huntelaar – who had scored an injury-time penalty winner against Mexico -  didn’t take one.

Whatever the case, there was little surprise that Vlaar missed his kick.

Certainly Vlaar had a good game over 120 minutes. It says something, though, that on a night that pitted two teams of repute, we talked about defenders as the penalty competition neared.

Sadly, that was how it was.

Given the success that Van Gaal has had this tournament by sticking rather than twisting, it was never likely that Holland would take the game to their opponents. Had Argentina scored then we may have seen a more open game. As it turned out Holland strangled it.

Perhaps we have the right final. We do probably have the best two teams. It’s just that one is looking a little better than the other.
