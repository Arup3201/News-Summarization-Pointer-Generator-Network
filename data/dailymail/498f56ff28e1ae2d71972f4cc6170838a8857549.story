Michael Brown's stepfather has said sorry for his controversial and incendiary chants aimed towards the unarmed teen's supporters the night of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Wilson.

The apology comes one day after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that his department was actively pursuing an investigation into whether Louis Head incited the riots that left parts of the city a burning wreck.

Head issued a statement to the effect that while he was sorry for screaming 'Burn this b**** down!', to arrest and charge him 'goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision (of the grand jury) itself.' 

The victim's stepfather (center) screamed 'Burn this b**** down' as he stood next to Brown's mother in the seconds after he learned of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson 

Head, who is married to Brown's mother, apologized to those 'who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. It wasn't.' 

He said that he feels he is being unfairly blamed for the chaos that followed his outburst, which was videoed by the New York Times on November 24, moments after the grand jury decision came in. 

Furthermore, it is understood that Head will not face any charges for his furious invective last Monday night, despite Jackson's revelations on Fox News at the beginning of the week.

Speaking on Monday night's Fox News, Jackson was asked by host Sean Hannity whether he believed charges should be pressed against Head for his role in the disturbances that evening, posing the question, 'Is that inciting a riot?'

 'Something came over me as I watched and listened to my wife, the mother of Michael Brown Jr., react to the gut-wrenching news that the cop who killed her son wouldn't be charged with a crime, my emotions admittedly got the best of me.

'This is my family. I was so angry and full of raw emotions, as so many others were, and granted I screamed out words I shouldn't have screamed in the heat of the moment. I was wrong and I humbly apologize to all those who read my anger and my pain as a true desire for what I want for the community.

'To place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community and country after the Grand Jury decision goes way too far and is wrong as the decision itself. To declare a state of emergency and send a message of war, not peace, before a Grand Jury decision is announced is also wrong.

'In the end I've lived in this community for a long time. The last thing I truly wanted was to see it go up in flames. In spite of my frustration, it really hurt me to see that. It's time to rebuild. If we are to honor Michael Brown's memory we need to work together to make rebuilding happen. I plan to remain here and do my part in earnest truth.'

In reply, Jackson said, 'We are pursuing those comments. And there is a lot of discussion going on about that right now. But I really can't get into that right now.'

Ferguson police spokesman, Jeff Small clarified Jackson's comments and said that Head is 'one of the people being looked at as part of an ongoing investigation into the activities surrounding Nov 24 pertaining to the rioting, looting and arsons.' 

However, despite the claims from CNN that Head will not face charges, there has been no official confirmation.

Yesterday it was announced that law enforcement were looking into Louis Head's comments as part of a broader investigation into the arson, vandalism and looting that followed the November 24 grand jury announcement, St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman said. Twelve commercial buildings were destroyed by fire.

Brown, 18, who was black and unarmed, was killed August 9 by Darren Wilson, who is white. Wilson, who resigned from the Ferguson department last weekend, had told the grand jury his life was being threatened, but some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender.

Video widely circulated after last week's grand jury announcement shows Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, on top of a car and breaking down as the decision blares over a stereo. 

Head, her husband, comforts her then yells angry comments, including 'Burn this bitch down!'

Family attorney Benjamin Crump has called the reaction 'raw emotion,' but 'completely inappropriate.' He did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.

Charges? Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said that his department is pursuing an investigation into whether or not to charge Louis Head for inciting the Ferguson riots

Head has not yet been interviewed by police, and there is no timetable for when the investigation will be complete, Schellman said. 

He declined to discuss what specific charges Head could face. 

A message left with a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch was not immediately returned.

Ferguson police spokesman Jeff Small said that department is not conducting a separate investigation of Head.

Most of the violence occurred in the first two days after the announcement. Peaceful protests have continued, including one Tuesday involving students who walked out of classes from three Ferguson-area high schools.

The Ferguson-Florissant School District said in a letter to students and parents teachers accompanied the students to ensure their safety but that the protests were student-led. 

The letter also said the district dispatched transportation to pick up students and return them to classes, though some chose to walk back.

It was their first day back in class after Thanksgiving break was extended a day due to bad weather Monday, when similar walkouts were staged across the country.

While daytime protests continue, nighttime demonstrations have waned. There were 124 arrests in Ferguson in the five days following the grand jury announcement, but none since Friday.

As a result, police and the National Guard are scaling back. Schellman said county officers are no longer working 12-hour shifts, though a small contingent will remain posted at night outside Ferguson police headquarters, which has been a focal point for protest gatherings.

CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes says no:

'I think they'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire. I think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching CNN. They're not watching media reporting of him saying that,' he told 'The Situation Room.' 'So it is probably very few people that heard it at that time.'

Gov. Jay Nixon also announced Tuesday that the National Guard has completed duties in the city of St. Louis and is reducing its presence - which peaked at about 2,200 guard members - in Ferguson and elsewhere in St. Louis County. Still, nearly 1,300 remain in the region. Nixon also said the Missouri State Highway Patrol will continue to work with local police. 

It was last Monday, after spending months appealing for calm that Michael Brown's family exploded into rage when it was announced that the grand jury had decided not to charge Officer Darren Wilson.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department.

She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown.'

'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!'

Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face.

'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!'

'They still don't care!' she screamed as she threw her arms in frustration. 'They never going to care!'

She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.'

He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. He did this at least ten times and called for a microphone at one point to spread his message to more people.

At that, some of the crowd did become agitated toward the police.

Wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I Am Mike Brown' while was expressing his rage toward the crowd and cameras, Head also had a beanie on that had a photograph of Michael Brown. 

As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters.

Head has a long rap sheet which includes two felony narcotics convictions and he pleaded guilty in 1997 to marijuana distribution and was put on probation for five years.

In mid-2003, he pleaded guilty to a felony count of narcotics trafficking and he was sentenced to seven years in prison.

He was released in 2008 after five years behind bars.
