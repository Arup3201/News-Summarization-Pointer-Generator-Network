A pair of skis took pride of place as the downhill slalom star Chemmy Alcott, who represented Britain four times in the Winter Olympics, married Scottish skier Dougie Crawford.

A guest in tartan joined the celebrations at Syon House in West London on Friday carrying the skis decorated with Union Jacks.

It was proof that although Chemmy, 31, has announced her retirement from skiing, she has not left the piste far behind.

Alcott recovered just in time to compete in the Winter Olympics in Sochi this year, and admitted her 19th place finish in the downhill skiing was 'as good as gold'.

Chemmy and Dougie – who have dated for five years – are honeymooning in Tanzania.

Alcott, 31, has already announced her retirement from skiing
