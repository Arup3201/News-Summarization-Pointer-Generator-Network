Los Angeles Police Department is under fire for giving an escort to a convicted Mexican Mafia hit man so he could speak to a business leaders' conference.

Rene Enriquez, 52, known as 'The Boxer', was a leader in one of the US's most notorious and violent gangs, the Mexican Mafia, and is currently serving two life sentences for murder.

But yesterday he was given a police escort from prison to downtown Los Angeles  to address a group of local police chiefs and wealthy business leaders.

Enriquez was speaking to around 125 people about the inner-workings of the criminal enterprise.

Formed in the Californian prison system in the 1950s, the Mexican Mafia has a reputation for extreme violence. 

Enriquez worked his way up from enforcer to a leader in the organization - which is also known as La Eme - before his arrest and conviction.

After two decades in the gang he defected in 2003 and began helping police by describing the hierarchy and methods used by the gang.

Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff has called for an investigation into the incident and called the episode 'embarrassing'.

'There were some decisions made that in retrospect were the wrong decisions,' Soboroff said.

He called the LAPD's involvement in the event as 'very, very misconceived and surprising' and a 'giant waste of public resources.'

NBC News reported that a source who attended the session said Enriquez had the air of a 'corporate leader' who provided 'a rare look into life of a criminal corporate executive.'

The source said Enriquez discussed 'gang franchising, marketing, sales, merchandising and branding.'

The LA Times reported that from around 12pm police secured a section  near Spring and 6th streets, where the meeting took place, and unmarked sedans dropped off uniformed officers.

A bomb squad vehicle was also spotted outside the building for a short period of time.

How much the operation cost is not yet known but the LAPD said the session served an educational purpose.

In a statement to NBC News they said: 'The purpose was to learn how a transnational criminal enterprise was built, branded and marketed.

'It is the hope that we can learn and develop better strategies to counter these threats to our region.' 

The convicted killer is the subject of a book, 'The Black Hand: The Bloody Rise and Redemption of 'Boxer' Enriquez, a Mexican Mob Killer' - and people leaving the event were spotted carrying copies.

Enriquez rose from low-level thug to a major player in the organization as his reputation for violence grew and he served time in prisons such as San Quentin and Folsom.

Heavily tattooed, the black hand on his chest is the symbol of the Mexican Mafia.

In 1993, Enriquez pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and is serving life in prison. 

In a 2008 interview with the BBC he said: 'I believe I'm a cut above the rest.' 

'As a Mafioso, you have an elitist, arrogant mentality. 

'That's how you carry yourself in the Mexican Mafia - you walk into a room and everybody knows you're a leader.'
