All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will have to pass tough new English language checks before being allowed to treat patients in the UK.

NHS trusts will be required to check the language competency of all their healthcare workers, before they are given licence to practise in the UK.

The move marks an extension of legislation introduced early last year, which demands that all foreign doctors are now subjected to tough language checks before treating patients.

Since the new law was passed 429 doctors have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. 

Until now only nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the EU were subject to any language competency tests.

All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will be required to pass English language competency tests before treating patients in the UK after MPs voted to extend legislation introduced last year for all foreign doctors

But today MPs voted to extend the rules to cover those from member states. 

Today health minister Dr Dan Poulter said voting to include all healthcare professionals, as well as doctors, would offer 'better protection for patients'.

Debating the final stage of the legislation, he said: 'We all value the contribution that doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals from all over the world make to our NHS, but being able to speak and communicate to a good standard of English is essential to provide high quality and safe patient care.

'These new laws will provide protection for patients and the public.'

Currently the Nursing and Midwifery Council is only required to test the language skills of those nurses and midwives coming to work in the UK from outside the EU.

Those moving from member states are permitted to begin work without taking a language test. 

The NMC said there are currently 26,474 nurses and midwives from the EU on their register, while another 66,163 are from non-European Economic Area countries.

There are a total of 685,262 nurses and midwives on the register.

Under the new powers if an applicant cannot provide evidence of their language competency, the NMC will be able to ask them to take an internationally recognised test.

The NMC's new powers are expected to come into effect later this year.

A change in the law, which was passed for doctors last year, came after German doctor Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs and gave Mr Gray an overdose

Until last year when the law changed, the General Medical Council only had the powers to test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU.

Since 1983, the doctors' regulatory body had been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from EU countries.

Last year's change in law for doctors was prompted by an 'alarming' number of cases where patients complained about poor treatment from doctors with a poor grasp of the English language.

In 2008 German doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs.

As a result Dr Ubani, who was working his first shift in the UK providing out-of-hours cover, injected Mr Gray with 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine. 

An inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor English.  

The Nigerian-born medic was struck off by the General Medical Council but was able to continue working in his adopted country of Germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and a small fine.

In addition, an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 after patients complained of inadequate treatment, citing language difficulties.

In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Government proposed changing the law in September 2013.

The language tests were to be introduced for the first time, for doctors arriving from the EU.

Health minister, Dr Poulter added: 'As a practising NHS doctor, I know the importance of good communication skills to ensure the very best patient care.

'And I have seen first hand when poor communication has let down patients.

'As a minister, I am pleased to be using my front line healthcare experience to give our healthcare regulators these important new language testing powers, which will benefit and protect patients and the public.'

The bodies that regulate nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists will be given the same powers as the GMC.

The GMC now has the power to investigate any complaints made about doctors' poor language skills. 

And as part of their regular appraisals, and the new medical revalidation process for doctors, which they must pass to continue treating patients, the GMC now checks language skills of those medics from overseas.
