Quizzed: Mr Johnson debated the burka with a Muslim mother who called in to the show

Boris Johnson backed a ban on veils in the classroom yesterday after he was confronted by a Muslim woman who wears the burqa on a radio phone in.

The London Mayor said schools should have the right to force pupils to show their faces to teachers.

He told London radio station LBC: ‘Normally I’m in favour of liberty and people wearing whatever they want. Where I do draw the line though, I think that the face veil is a very difficult thing to make work in a school.

‘I think that you’ve got to teach in a way that you can see how the kids are responding. They’ve got to be able to participate in the class. I think that it’s only fair that they should be able to react and take part in that way.

‘I don’t think that it can reasonably be called a standard piece of uniform to get little girls to cover their faces.’

Mr Johnson was quizzed by a woman identified only as Milam from South Norwood in South London, who said that her 15 year old daughter has voluntarily worn a full face veil since she was 12.

She said: ‘I myself wear the burqa.

‘My daughter is 15. From the age of 12 or maybe 13, she decided for herself, her own free will that she would like to do it.

'As parents Boris, we are expected in society to teach our children to respect one another, to respect schools and so on. On the other hand Boris, you are asking us to go against school policies or school rules if it involves wearing the face veils.’

But Mr Johnson said: ‘I’m afraid that is my view I think in places of instruction where you’re asking kids to participate in a class, to have fun together when the teacher has got to see how the lesson is going down.

‘I’ve been a teacher, very ingloriously in the past. It is a terribly difficult job and you’ve got to know what, how your pupils are responding. And I think that is what I would like to see in classes financed by the British State that’s what I believe in.’
