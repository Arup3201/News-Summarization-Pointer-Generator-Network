Deformed: Isabel Gonzalez, pictured, was butchered by the facial injections that were supposed to make her look radiant

A Florida woman's dream of looking younger turned into a nightmare recently when she was left deformed after a trip to the day spa.

Isabel Gonzalez, of East Fort Lauderdale, paid $890 for 'facial rejuvenation' injections at Viviana's Body Secrets Spa in Doral, Florida.

But she walked out with her face swollen, itchy and infected.

The Miami-Dade Health Department shut down the business on Thursday and arrested its owner Edna Viviana Ayala.

The 39-year-old has been slapped her with a raft of charges including practicing medicine without a license.

Gonzalez told police that on July 1 Ayala gave her vitamin injections in between her eyebrows, on the corners of her lips and on both sides of her lower chin.

But when she hadn't noticed any change two weeks later, she called Ayala who gave her a another round of injections.

This time the unlicensed beautician used a thicker needle, NBC Miami reported.

Soon after the second procedure, her face turned bright red, swollen and itchy and a painful infection developed.

According to police, Ayala brought medications to Gonzalez's house and also brought her to a doctor for treatment. But the spa owner soon stopped answering the woman's calls or returning her messages.

Injections: Gonzalez, pictured, was told the injections would make her look younger

In August, her face got so bad that 
Gonzalez went to the emergency room of Broward General Medical Center. 
She is still there, being treated for the horrific infections attacking 
her face.

The state health department shut down the day spa yesterday, prompted by Gonzalez's complaint.

Ayala faces charges of aggravated 
battery, practicing medicine without a license, practicing massage 
without a license and causing serious injury by practicing as a health 
care professional without a license.

But Alaya's attorney denied she injected Gonzalez with anything.

'At no time did Ms Ayala ever use or inject any substance whatsoever, including vitamins into Ms Gonzalez,' Milena Abreu told NBC.

Viviana's Body Secrets Spa website is still up and running, and includes video demonstrations of Alaya massaging clients and performing other treatments.

The site boasts: 'We offer numerous facial and body treatments that will bring a smile to your face, when you see and feel the results. Your love ones will definitely notice a difference in you.'

Vitamin injections have become increasingly popular and last year Simon Cowell admitted to taking an intravenous cocktail of vitamins C, B12 and magnesium to make him look and feel young.

According to the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery vitamin jabs for the face usually feature a mixture of vitamins and amino acids. Placenta extracts and organic silicon can also be added.

The aim of vitamin jabs is to replace the minerals,vitamins and amino acids that decrease in the skin with aging. It is said that they help maintain firmness and reduce lines and wrinkles

The shot is injected into selected areas beneath the surface of the skin and each treatment takes up to 20 minutes. For those who experience pain, a local anesthetic cream can be applied.

The results are not permanent, and many patients are instructed to return for injections every three months. Risks include allergic reactions and bruising.
