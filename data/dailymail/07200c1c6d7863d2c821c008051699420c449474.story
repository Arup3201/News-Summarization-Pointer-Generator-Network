Amanda Bynes's parents have visited the troubled star at the California hospital where she is being held against her will.

Rick Bynes and Lynn Organ were pictured arriving at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, where their daughter was taken after flying into LAX yesterday, where she made rambling claims to photographers and seemed unwell.

She was driven to hospital and reportedly taken under a psychiatric hold after being tricked into flying to California by Sam Lutfi, the controversial manager who was blamed for Britney Spears's public 2008 breakdown.

It followed a troubling outburst by the star, 28, who accused her own father of sexually abusing her as a child - before retracting the tirade and saying a microchip in her head made her say it.

Amanda's mom issued a statement in the aftermath, refuting the claims and saying she was 'heartbroken'.

But Amanda seemed not to have made peace with her family after she had landed, telling paparazzi she had 'taken out a restraining order' against her dad.

Moments later she was taken to the hospital, where, according to TMZ, she was held under section 51510 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code.

The law lets mentally ill people who are classified as a danger to themselves or others be taken in against their will.

History repeating itself? Britney Spears seen in 2007 with her controversial ex manager Sam Lutfi, shortly before she suffered a public breakdown 

Her detention is another twist in the star's very public downward spiral, which had previously culminated in claims she was getting married - which were promptly swatted away by her would-be groom.

On Wednesday Amanda tweeted the supposed news of her engagement - saying her wedding was going to go on the front of a major magazine.

But Caleb Pusey, her supposed betrothed, said the pair weren't even dating - and that he hadn't even spoken to her in months.

Friends of Caleb, 19, told TMZ that the engagement was a figment of Amanda's imagination. She repeated the claims after landing at LAX - though she refused to name the man in question when asked.

The journey was reportedly a scheme masterminded by Sam Lutfi, whom Britney Spears's family blame for her 2008 breakdown during which she shaved off all her hair.

Sources claim that Amanda - who tweeted her affection for Lutfi hours before taking off - had convinced her to sue her parents, and told her to come to LA to meet with attorneys.

On arrival she told photographers that she was going to meet with 'sick lawyers'. But a report in TMZ said that when she stepped out of her car she was surrounded by hospital staff instead.  

Lutfi recently tweeted a response to celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, who has asked after Amanda. He said: 'She's in good hands now. Many thanks to all those that helped along the way.'

And now Perez claims Bynes has told them: 'Last time I trusted Lutfi he put me in a conservatorship which ended in August I'm not stupid. 

'You are all listening to my brain…I can handle Sam, he just flew me back to LA and I'm going to meet some sick lawyers.' 

Lutfi has strenuously denied any claims that he was responsible for Britney's meltdown. 

On his Twitter bio, he says he was 'FALSELY accused of doing horrible things by horrible people.' 

Britney's mother Lynne Spears blamed Lutfi for his involvement in her daughter's breakdown, when he managed her in 2007 and 2008. 

Amanda is expected to be held at the hospital for 72 hours, but the hold can be extended for a further 14 days.

It is expected that her parents will try to get another conservatorship.

Lynn said her daughter's mental illness is to blame for the claims.
