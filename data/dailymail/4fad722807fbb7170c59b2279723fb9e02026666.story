Nine Cleveland police officers involved in a deadly 2012 police shooting are accusing the police department of racial discrimination.

Eight white officers and one Hispanic officer filed a federal lawsuit against the city on Friday, alleging that the police department treats non-black officers involved in shootings of blacks more harshly than black officers.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for discrimination and civil rights violations after they were suspended, allowed back on regular duty and then placed back on restricted duty in a move they argue was 'politically expedient.'

Racial tension: Several of the officers involved in the 2012 shooting deaths of two black unarmed Cleveland citizens are suing the city over claims non-black officers are treated unfairly harshly following shootings of black suspects

Thirteen Cleveland police officers fired into the victims' car after a high-speed chase, killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school

'A serious dichotomy exists as a result of the defendants' longstanding practices and procedures which place onerous burdens on non-African American officers, including the plaintiffs, because of their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force,' reads the suit.

The officers were not allowed back on to regular duty until June 2014, reports CNN. By then, they say they'd missed out on potential wages, transfers and promotions.

They are suing for unspecified damages.

The relatives of the two African American people killed in a barrage of police gunfire in 2012 will split a $3 million settlement from the city of Cleveland, the attorney for one of the families said Tuesday.

Thirteen Cleveland police officers fired into the victims' car after a high-speed chase, killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school. Both were unarmed.

Russell family attorney Terry Gilbert said the settlement of the federal lawsuit helps avoid long and expensive litigation. Williams' family attorney, David Malik, declined to comment.

City spokesman Dan Williams would not comment on specifics of the agreement but said 'the settlement speaks for itself.'

Gilbert called the shooting 'probably one of the worst cases of police misconduct' in U.S. history because of the number of police officers involved. More than 100 officers and 60 police cars, including some driven by supervisors, were involved in the chase. Gilbert said that by the time the chase ended in East Cleveland, officers had Russell's car blocked in and surrounded when they opened fire.

'We felt it important to address the conduct of all the shooters, not just officer Brelo,' Gilbert said, referring to Michael Brelo, who faces two counts of voluntary manslaughter for having jumped on the hood of Russell's car and firing the last 15 rounds into the windshield. He fired a total of 49 rounds. Five supervisors face misdemeanor dereliction of duty charges.

Gilbert said the lack of supervision during the chase and shooting was evidence of a systemic problem within the police department that 'led to the massive violations of the constitutional rights of Russell and Williams.'

The chase began when officers patrolling near a homeless shelter on the edge of downtown Cleveland thought they heard a gunshot. Investigators later said it was likely that the officers heard Russell's car backfiring. That sparked a 20-mile chase that lasted 23 minutes and reached speeds of 110 mph.

The U.S. Justice Department is conducting an investigation of the Cleveland police department's pursuit and use of force practices.

The officers were placed on leave for three days and then put on a 45-day 'cooling-off' period before being allowed back on regular duty

They were then placed back on restrictive duty in a move their lawsuit says was politically motivated
