Two teenage sisters have been murdered in Pakistan after they were accused of tarnishing their family's name by making a video of themselves dancing in the rain. 

The girls, aged 15 and 16, are seen running around in traditional dress with two other younger children outside their bungalow in the town of Chilas, in the northern region of Gilgit. 

The sisters, named as Noor Basra and Noor Sheza, appear to break into dance and one even flashes a smile at the camera.

However, when the footage was circulated via mobile phones, it caused outrage in the conservative Pakistani town.

Last Sunday the girls were shot alongside their mother in their home by five gunmen.

Police are investigating whether the attack was arranged by the girls' step-brother, named as Khutore, who allegedly wanted to 'restore the family's honour' according to The Sunday Times.

The sisters' other brother has filed a case against Khutore and the four other alleged accomplices who are now believed to be on the run.

Last year four women are believed to 
have been killed by tribal elders for dancing and singing with men at a 
wedding party in the remote north-western village of Kohistan in 
Pakistan.

A tribal council
 of clerics – known as a Jirga – reportedly condemned the women to death
 for ‘fornication’ and staining their families’ names.

Their
 actions were said to have brought shame on the community, which frowns 
on men and women dancing together or fraternising at all.

The Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan said at least 943 women and girls were murdered in 2011 for 
allegedly defaming their family’s honour.

According to women's rights group, the Aurat Foundation, about 1,000 'honour' killings take place in Pakistan every year.

The statistics highlight the scale of
 violence suffered by many women in conservative Muslim Pakistan, where 
they are frequently treated as second-class citizens.

From a young age Malala Yousafzai openly spoke out about the importance of education growing up in the Swat valley where the Taliban bans girls from going to school.

But her outspoken views led to her being shot in the head last year on her way home from class.

After the assassination attempt in October 2012, the Taliban said she had been targeted because she promoted 'western thinking'. 

The shooting sparked outrage in Pakistan and her story drew global attention to the struggle for women's rights in Malala's homeland. 

Following the attack Malala was brought to the U.K. for treatment and spent several months in a hospital undergoing skull reconstruction and cochlear implant surgeries.

Now rehabilitating in Britain, Malala is the youngest Nobel peace prize nominee in history.

Michael Pietsch, executive vice president and publisher of Little, Brown, said: 'Malala is already an inspiration to millions around the world.'

The 15-year-old recently signed a book deal worth a reported £2m and set up a charity to support the education of 40 girls aged five to 12 in the Swat valley who would otherwise be forced into domestic labour.

Actress Angelina Jolie even pledged to donate thousands of pounds to the charity.

Malala's book will tell the story about the traumatic event and her long-running campaign to promote children's education.
