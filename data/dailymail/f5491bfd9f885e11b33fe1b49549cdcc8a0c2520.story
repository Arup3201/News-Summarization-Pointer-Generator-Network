Misery: Tailbacks reportedly stretched back to Cheshire after a fatal accident involving three motorbikes between junctions 14 and 15 on the M6 in Staffordshire

A man has died after three motorbikes and a car collided during a pile-up on the M6 today.

Motorists were left stuck in their cars for up to five hours in sweltering conditions following the accident at about 9am.

Police said the accident was caused when a HGV lorry blew a tyre between junction 15 of the M6 and Yarnfield, near Stone, in Staffordshire.

As traffic slowed down to avoid debris in the road, three motorbikes and a car collided.

A 63-year-old man, from the Blackpool area, was seriously injured and died on his way to hospital

Three other people, including the man's female pillion passenger, 49, also suffered serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening.

The road has now been cleared but the tailbacks were said to have stretched more than 14 miles all the way back to Cheshire.

Many people were stranded on the motorway and were forced to get out their cars to try and cool off as the mercury topped 35 degrees on the ground.

Some 
people even took to entertaining the crowd by playing a banjo and guitar
 as the traffic tailback stretched into Cheshire.

Motorist Mia Davies said: 'I'm stuck in a traffic jam on M6 but there is a guy playing a banjo to the crowd #surreal.'

Olympic
 double medalist Rhiannon Henry said: 'Stuck in the M6 gridlock. Hear 
the accident that happened this morning was awful. Thoughts with those 
involved! Glad we came with plenty of water and snacks.

'Passengers out of their cars playing catch, having picnics and a can or two.'

All three lanes were eventually cleared by around 2.45pm.

Gridlock: Drivers amused themselves as temperatures soared. There were queues of more than five hours

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'It is believed three motorcycles were involved.

'Attempts were made to resuscitate a man who was riding one of the motorbikes both at the scene and en-route to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Unfortunately despite those best efforts, he was confirmed dead at hospital.

'His pillion passenger, a woman in her 40s, had suspected shoulder and arm fractures. She was given immediate treatment for her injuries and pain relief was administered. She was taken to the same hospital.

'Two other men who complained of neck and back injuries were both immobilised with the use of spinal boards and neck collars and were taken to the same hospital.'

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police 
said: 'At around 9am a HGV had a blowout travelling between junction 15 
of the M6 motorway and Yarnfield, near Stone.

'The lorry landed on the hard shoulder. As a result of the blowout, a lot of tyre debris was left on the carriageway.

'We
 believe traffic began to slow to avoid hitting the debris. As a result 
of the traffic slowing there was a collision involving three motorcycles
 and a car.

'All four 
motorcyclists were taken to the University Hospital of North 
Staffordshire and, sadly, a 63-year-old man from Blackpool died on his 
way to hospital.'
