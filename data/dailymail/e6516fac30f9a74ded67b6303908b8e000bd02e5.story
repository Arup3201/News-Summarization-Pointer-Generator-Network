A man behind the wheel of a loaded semi-trailer who was spotted driving on a highway with two tyres missing told police his truck would be 'okay' despite obvious defects.

The driver was pulled over last Tuesday after a policeman saw the B-double semi-trailer on the Newell Highway at Daroobalgie in central NSW.

It was missing two tyres and two chains holding the axle in place, according to the Daily Telegraph.

When the officer initially contacted the driver on the two-way radio to notify him of the missing tyres, the man said it would be okay as he was going to stop in Dubbo - 150km away - to get it fixed.

The driver's log books showed he had missed several rest breaks and had critical fatigue on a trip from Melbourne to Queensland.

The vehicle was one of nearly 10,000 trucks and trailers inspected by police and Roads and Maritime Services inspectors over a seven-day operation last week.

Police issued 796 defect notices, 129 infringements and 119 breaches of registration, weight, licence, and secure and adjust load matters.

Over the seven-day operation, police found issues of speed tampering, fatigue and drug taking among drivers

They found issues of speed tampering, load management, fatigue and drug taking among drivers.

'To hear of one driver undergoing a drug test at Coolac with a negative result, only for that driver to test positive later in the day at Marulan, suggests that drug use is a problem for some drivers,' Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander, Assistant Commissioner John Hartley said.

'To see continuing evidence of speed tampering is particularly disappointing. 

'Speed tampering is not only dangerous to the driver and other motorists, but it also places the operator and directors of companies at great risk of prosecution, which is evident in recent court outcomes where penalties have been over a million dollars in some circumstances.' 

Officers also found some load management issues with trucks on the road

Police conducted 1,861 random drug tests resulting in 22 drivers testing positive for the presence of drugs in their system

Police also conducted 3,478 random breath tests for alcohol with no positive results, and 1,861 random drug tests resulting in 22 drivers testing positive for the presence of drugs in their system.

Officers from Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia also took part in the operation, where a range of issues concerning heavy vehicle and load compliance were identified in those states.
