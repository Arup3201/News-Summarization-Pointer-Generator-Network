Joan Rivers could have been saved following her medical procedure gone wrong if doctors had headed signs the comedian was going into shock, claims new report.

Rivers' doctors ignored her dropping blood pressure and pulse and even failed to call 911 for 10 precious minutes as they attempted to resuscitate her once they realized she was dying, according to Page Six.

Prior to that, insiders, outside experts and the findings of a federal report reveal that Drs. Lawrence Cohen and Gwen Korovin--along with an unnamed anesthesiologist--carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with Rivers.

Drs. Lawrence Cohen (left) and Gwen Korovin (right) were part of a small team of medical care providers that a state report says 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention' in the late Joan Rivers' routine procedure gone wrong

But something was wrong at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28 and the trouble started after 9am, when Rivers was put under with normal vital signs.

Fifteen minutes later, Rivers started showing signs of shock as her blood pressure  dropped to 92/54 and her pulse fell to 56.

'At this point, something has gone wrong, the procedure must come to an end, and she needs to be resuscitated,' a veteran paramedic not involved in the case told the Post.

The doctors failed to act when Rivers' vital signs dropped even further, reports the Post.

Instead, with the 81-year-old's blood pressure at 89/44 and her pulse at 54, the doctors administered propofol--the powerful anesthetic that led to the death of Michael Jackson.

'That doesn’t make any sense,' said Page Six's paramedic. 'You’re sedating someone who’s going into shock.'

Even as she began coding, with her bp at 84/40, and her pulse at 47, the examination reportedly continued.

That was at 9:28am, 12 minutes after Rivers' vital signs should have first caused concern. Still, the examination continued, with just an increase to her oxygen flow.

'Routine': Rivers, 81, was put under anesthesia for a routine procedure on August 28 from which she would never wake up

The tragedy occurred at Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan. Investigators say the doctors who performed the procedure failed to act as Rivers showed signs her condition was deteriorating

Two minutes later, the examination was stopped and records show the doctors began trying to resuscitate Rivers with life-saving drugs.

They wouldn't call 911 for another ten minutes. And records indicate they did not administer CPR as they awaited the paramedics.

By the time they arrived at 9:47, paramedics found Rivers' turning blue form lack of oxygen.

A state report released early in November said the clinic 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention.'

Rivers died September 4 of brain damage due to lack of oxygen. 

The federal Department of Health and Human Services has given Yorkville Endoscopy until January 7 to correct deficiencies to avoid losing Medicare accreditation. 

The clinic said it has submitted a plan to state and federal accreditation agencies addressing all issues raised. It said the physicians involved no longer provide services there.

Also among the series of blunders reported by the New York Post's Page Six, was that staff at the Manhattan clinic failed to weigh Joan before sedating her with Propofol.

Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, (seen left with Joan at a red carpet event and right with her son more recently during a shopping trip after her mothers' death) will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz

Melissa Rivers is preparing to launch legal action against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic.

She will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother's personal ENT doctor Gwen Korovin as well.

A source told MailOnline: 'Melissa is undaunted, she's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved. These doctors will rue the day they went near Joan.'

Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz. 

In a statement, attorneys Jeffrey B. Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz said: 'Our client, Melissa Rivers, is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report.

'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure. Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.'
