Lauren Gavin with her kitten Gollum, who survived a full cycle in a washing machine

His namesake was a character in The Lord of the Rings, the famous novel by J.R.R. Tolkien.

But Gollum the kitten has proved to be a Lord of the Rinse - after surviving a 30-minute cycle in a washing machine.

The eight week-old hid in a pile of laundry to escape the noise of owner Lauren Gavin hoovering.

Ms Gavin then tipped the load into the washing machine and put it on a full colour wash without spotting her inside.

She returned to her living room to hoover and half an hour later opened the washing machine - and Gollum fell unconscious onto the kitchen floor.

The 22-year-old picked her up and ran with her to the nearby vets for lifesaving treatment.

The tortoiseshell kitten was so cold and had so much fluid around her lungs that it took an hour to raise her temperature.

But after being fitted with a drip she eventually regained consciousness and returned home the same night to be reunited with her brother Squidgy.

Ms Gavin, of Larkfield, Kent, said: 'I'd been hoovering, and the other cats went upstairs to get away from the noise.

'Gollum went into the kitchen and must have hopped in. I went to pull my washing out and she was just slumped on top of it.

'When I saw her I was devastated. She was meowing so faintly I could barely hear it, and she was hardly breathing. It was just so unexpected.

'I literally just ran into the vets and explained what happened. They whisked her off instantly into the back room.

'We waited and when they came to say she was OK I was so relieved. She is practically back to her normal self. They said she shouldn't jump around but she was jumping around just the same.

It took vets an hour to raise Gollum's temperature (pictured with owner Lauren Gavin) after she fell unconscious

'I'm so grateful to the vets for saving her life.' Verity Page, practice manager at Sandhole Vets, in Snodland, Kent, said: 'It took 45 minutes just to register a temperature.

'She is an amazing little kitten. She is like a miracle case. We are amazed she survived.'
