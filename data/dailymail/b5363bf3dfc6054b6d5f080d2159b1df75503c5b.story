Switzerland's Haris Seferovic has declared his match-winning goal against Ecuador a birthday present to his father.

Seferovic pounced in injury-time to complete a 2-1 comeback victory for his side, just 15 minutes after coming off the bench.

It provided a thrilling finale to the Group E clash in Brasilia on Monday, with Ecuador having launched their last attack moments prior to conceding at the other end.

And Seferovic revealed his intervention came on a special day for his family.

'I give a big thank you to my father, it was his birthday and I dedicate my goal to him,' he said.

'There is nothing better than achieving a goal like this and until I scored I had not seen a lot of the ball, but when it comes to it you have to be ready.'

Having slipped behind to Enner Valencia's opener, Switzerland needed another substitute to draw level.

Admir Mehmedi was the scorer with his first touch since coming on at the interval. 'Of course I was disappointed that I did not have the chance to play from the beginning but I was ready for my role,' he added.

'As a striker, you have to stand where I stood, one against one. Crucially, we never gave up. Morale and team spirit were the decisive factor for us.'

Ecuador coach Reinaldo Rueda declared the result a "moral blow" for his side but insisted everything was still to play for against France and Honduras.

'This is football, it happens that you lose in the last minute,' he said. 'We lost our order...only in this last minute were we were not organised. This is a moral blow, but my squad has a lot of strength. There are still six points available, so it is not yet lost.'
