New Bank of England boss Mark Carney today slammed self-obsessed bankers detached from reality have become ‘socially useless’ and must change their ways.

The Canadian former investment banker demanded a change in a City culture which has become disconnected from the businesses and workers who should benefit from a properly functioning economy.

And he vowed to ‘snuff out’ irresponsible behaviour, including mis-selling products to customers which they do not need just to make profit.

Criticism: Bank of England governor Mark Carney said bankers who do not focus on the wider economy are 'socially useless'

Mr Carney took charge as the first foreign governor  in Threadneedle Street last month, replacing Sir Mervyn King.

In his first major intervention yesterday, he announced interest rates were likely to remain at record lows for another three years.

In a major boost for mortgage bill payers, he vowed to keep rates low until unemployment fell below 7 per cent, which is not expected to happen until late 2016.

Today he turned his fire on bankers, demanding a ‘change in the culture’ in reckless institutions which have been blamed for the financial crash.

‘The cultural issue is fundamentally important,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘There has to be a change in the culture of these institutions. It’s something I’ve spoken about in the past when I was in Canada, and it applies absolutely here as well.’

He said finance can ‘absolutely play a socially useful and an economically useful function’.

But bankers and financiers had to focus on ‘the real economy, what it does for businesses making investment, what ultimately it means for jobs in the economy’.

He went on: ‘It’s the loss of that focus, it’s finance that becomes disconnected from the economy, from society, finance that only talks to itself and deals with each other, that becomes socially useless.

‘One of my other responsibilities is chairing the Financial Stability Board and a lot of what we’re doing there internationally is to strip out that type of behaviour.’

Disconnected: A banking sector which 'only talks to itself and deals with each other' is bad for the whole of society, Mr Carney warned

In particular he singled out banks who put profit before customers by selling products which they did not need.

Asked whether people working for banks should sell a product to a customer to make a profit, even if they know the product was bad for the customer, Mr Carney said: ‘Absolutely you shouldn’t sell it.’

He stressed that conduct in the City was the responsibility of the new Financial Conduct Authority.

Britain's interest rates are likely to remain at a record low for at least three more years, the new Governor of the Bank of England said yesterday.

The forecast was welcomed by business leaders, but will be a blow to millions of savers and pensioners.

Speaking at the Bank’s quarterly inflation report yesterday, Mark Carney made history by formally linking the base rate to unemployment – meaning rates will not rise from their current record low of 0.5 per cent until the jobless total falls to 7 per cent or lower.

The Bank suggests this will not happen until late 2016 – another three years or more.

Unemployment stands at 7.8 per cent, having peaked at over 8 per cent in the wake of the financial crisis, and Mr Carney said more than 750,000 jobs will need to be created to get it down to the threshold.

But he pointed out that rates would not automatically rise when unemployment hits 7 per cent.

He added: ‘Nor is 7 per cent a target. 7 per cent is merely a “way station” at which the [Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates] will reassess the state of the economy.’

Mr Carney said he has ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers, who have lost out since the Bank slashed rates to 0.5 per cent in 2009, but  launched the aggressive tactics to ‘secure the recovery’.

By the end of 2016, rates will have been at the record low for nearly eight years – the longest period they have been on hold since the aftermath of the Great Depression.

Figures published yesterday suggested savers will have been deprived of nearly £500billion in lost interest payments over those eight years.

But he added: ‘Even if we’re not directly responsible for that behaviour, it’s that attitude in institutions that undercuts their effectiveness, is bad for the system, and to the extent that with our powers we can use them, we work to snuff them out.

Mr Carney was hand-picked for the job of governor by George Osborne.

He sought to reassure the public that interest rates will not rise anytime soon and hopes the use of so-called ‘forward guidance’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery.

But he said he had ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers hit by the Bank’s announcement that interest rates will not rise from their record low until more than 750,000 new jobs have been created.

He said policymakers should not pull back from stimulating the economy too early or they will risk choking off the economic recovery and ending up with a similar situation to Japan, where interest rates have remained at rock-bottom levels for years.

Mr Carney said the best way to get back to normal interest rates is to have a strong economy.

He told the programme: ‘We have tremendous sympathy for savers. They have done the right thing, they have set aside some money, they are earning a lower return than they would have expected when they put money aside but the best way to get interest rates back to a normal level is to have a strong economy.

‘Let me tell you, I first lived in this country in the 1980s. After that I lived in Japan and it was the start of life after the financial crisis and in Japan they made two mistakes.

‘The first was they didn’t fix the banks quickly enough - in the UK we are fixing the banks. Secondly, as their recoveries began, they pulled back on stimulus too early and those recoveries didn’t gather life and as a consequence, almost a quarter-century later, interest rates are still at rock-bottom levels in Japan.

‘We don’t want to make those mistakes here in the UK. This is about ensuring that in the reasonable future, and I recognise that it’s difficult for savers, but in the reasonable future we’re delivering that strong economy that will deliver higher interest rates and jobs.’
