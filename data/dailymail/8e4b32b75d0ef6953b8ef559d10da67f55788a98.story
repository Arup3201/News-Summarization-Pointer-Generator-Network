A deluxe LA bunker was created in the 1930s by Nazi followers in America who were convinced Hitler was about to conquer the US and would need a base so he could establish Nazi rule.

Winona and Norman Stephens, the wealthy owners of the property, turned their land into a self-sustaining Nazi community for the dictator after being told by a German man named Herr Schmidt that his country would soon defeat the US.

Although details about Schmidt are scant, he was known to be a prominent member of the Silver Legion of America, a fascist, anti-Semitic, white supremacist group.

A deluxe LA bunker was created in the 1930s by Nazi followers in America who were convinced Hitler was planning to conquer the US and would need a base to operate from

Winona and Norman Stephens, the wealthy owners of the property, turned it into a safe compound for the dictator after being told by a man named Herr Schmidt that Germany would soon defeat the United States

A blueprint for part of Murphy Ranch.LA Curbed revealed the seemingly forgotten plans for the famous landmark which include those for and by the firm of the legendary Paul R. Williams

The Silver Shirts were a sinister group of 1930s fascists who took their name from Hitler's Brown Shirts grass roots organisation.

Fascism had been on the rise in the wake of the Great Depression and the Silver Shirts were one of the most fanatical organisations. 

According to reports Norman Stephens was an engineer and apparently financed the operation while his wife, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, believed Schmidt when he claimed to have supernatural powers.

The plans suggest that the wealthy owners of Murphy Ranch dreamed of a complex, self-sustaining 'utopia' with a mansion fit for a world leader, but they were never seen through

The compound was already equipped with a diesel power plant, 375,000 gallon concrete water tank, giant meat locker, 22 bedrooms and even a bomb shelter

The heavily guarded estate was home to a community of Hollywood fascists who hoped to ride out the war there 

Unconfirmed reports suggest that Schmidt was Hitler's agent in America. 

Schmidt warned the couple that Germany would soon defeat the United States and that the end of the world was at hand.

He persuaded them to invest $4million ($66 million today) to transform the property into a Nazi stronghold fit for Hitler. 

They bought the 55-acre ranch, under the name pseudonym 'Jessie M. Murphy, widow' in 1933.

Consequently the compound was equipped with a diesel power plant, 375,000 gallon concrete water tank, giant meat locker, 22 bedrooms and even a bomb shelter.

The heavily guarded became a home to a community of Hollywood fascists who hoped to ride out the war there and there were further plans to build five libraries, a swimming pool, several dining rooms and a gymnasium with money from Germany.

Now LA Curbed has revealed the seemingly forgotten plans for the famous landmark which include those for and by the firm of the legendary Paul R. Williams, who designed the homes of numerous celebrities, including Frank Sinatra. 

The couple had grand plans drawn up by several different architects, but they were not followed through.

In an episode of Travel Channel's 'Off Limits,' historian Randy Young reveals that the wrought iron gates at the entrance of the compound were made by famous African-American architect Paul Revere Williams.  

The ruins of the compound from where American Nazis hoped their leader would one day rule the world lies tucked away in the Los Angeles hills

'They may have been Nazis, but they were Nazis with taste,' he joked.

Williams' architectural sketches also included plans for a four-story mansion, 22 bedrooms and five bathrooms, but they were never carried out.

In 1941, the day after Pearl Harbour, as America entered World War Two, police raided the premises and rounded up the 50 or so American fascists who were living there.

Some reports suggest Herr Schmidt was arrested, although there is no proof of this.

Norman and Winona sold the compound in 1948 by which point they lived alone in a garage.

Abandoned in 1990s, today the eerie landmark lies in ruins, daubed with graffiti. 

Close to the homes of actors and directors such as Stephen Spielberg, the site has been a magnet for historians, curiosity-seekers and modern-day nazis

At one point after the war it became an artists colony and was home to the novelist Henry Miller

At one point after the war it became an artists colony and was home to the novelist Henry Miller. 

Historian Randy Young told the Sunday Express: 'This was supposed to be the seat of American fascism from where Hitler would one day run the United States.

'The neighbours were a little freaked out by the construction and weird happenings, but until war broke out, they thought they were just eccentric people.'  

The compound, which is located at the Will Rogers State Historic Park, can be accessed on a hike through Rustic Canyon.
