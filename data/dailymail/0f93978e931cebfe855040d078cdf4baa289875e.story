The famous voices behind the characters Bart and Lisa Simpson, Chief Wiggum and son Ralph, bartender Moe and Apu from Kwik-E-Mart celebrated 25 years of the show at the Hollywood Bowl.

The star-studded event called 'The Simpsons Take the Bowl' took place in California on Friday.

It featured Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria, the voices behind The Simpsons characters along with a host of music, stars and flashbacks from TV's longest-running scripted show.

Several members of The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra wore tall blue Marge Simpson wigs and performed classic clips from the show's past 25 seasons played on big screens above them.

The 26th season of The Simpsons begins on September 28.

To celebrate, legendary alternative pop star Weird Al Yankovic sang 'Oh yeah, The Simpsons will go on, long after the human race is gone.'

He also performed a little ditty about Homer and Marge to the tune of John Mellencamp's Jack and Diane.

Other guests who appeared during the two-hour program included show creator Matt Groening, former Simpsons writer Conan O'Brien, comedian Jon Lovitz, pro skateboarder Tony Hawk and Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer.

Zimmer, wearing a jacket covered with Bart faces, performed the music he composed for the Oscar-nominated short film The Longest Daycare, which shows how Maggie saves a butterfly from a classroom bully.

Stars: Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Nancy Cartwright delighted the crowd with their performance

At least 60 members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles filled the stage for a soaring rendition of Spider Pig, the song Homer dedicated to his special pet pig in The Simpsons Movie.

Then chorus members stripped off their robes to reveal sequined vests as they sang the Mr. Burns' song about wearing puppy fur, See My Vest, which culminated with a Rockettes-style kick line.

Azaria embodied several of the Simpsons characters he brings to life with his voice, including Moe and Apu, Disco Stu, Professor Frink and Duff Man. 

While portraying the beer-boasting Duff Man, a group of women dressed as Duff cheerleaders came onstage and fired T-shirt cannons into the crowd.

Meanwhile, Lovitz offered a tribute to the late Phil Hartman, a Simpsons regular who voiced various characters on the show until his death in 1998.

The entire Hollywood Bowl was Simpson-ified for the program, which continued on Saturday and Sunday night. 

Plastic doughnuts dangled above concertgoers' heads and life-sized cardboard cutouts of show characters were scattered throughout the venue.

New Simpsons animations were created just for the concert, including a peek at the Simpson family arriving at the Hollywood Bowl and Homer trying to resist pushing the fireworks button. 

Another bit showed Maggie launching the fireworks, and with that, pyrotechnics exploded above the famous Bowl shell.
