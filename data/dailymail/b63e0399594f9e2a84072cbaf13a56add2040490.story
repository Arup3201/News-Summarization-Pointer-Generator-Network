To cover up the fact he'd crashed his relative's car while driving drunk, Brian Byers concocted a plan to blame the accident on a faked patch of black ice, Sparta police say.

The New York Daily News reports that 20-year-old Byers was intoxicated behind the wheel of a 2001 black BMW when he blew past a stop sign and crashed the vehicle into the guard rail.

After driving the car back to his house, police say Byers began work on the coverup, filling two buckets with water and driving back to the scene of the crash in 20-year-old accomplice Alexander Zambenedetti's car.

On ice: Brian Byers, 20, crashed a relative's BMW while driving drunk and had the help of a friend, Alexander Zambenedetti, 20, to create a patch of black ice to fake an accident

The two splashed water onto Sawmill Road and possibly returned to refill the five-gallon buckets for multiple layers, according to authorities.

Police say by the time they were done, the two co-conspirators had left a patch of thick black ice on the road - an actual hazard to other drivers.

The pair were caught sitting in Zambenedetti's silver 2005 BMW by a patrol officer. The pair stuck out, as Byers's friend was shirtless in the 1 degree air.

When police questioned him inside the car, where the pair had also stashed the two buckets, Zambenedetti said he'd falling in snow and taken his wet shirt off. 

Police said he denied icing the roadway and claimed he didn't drive his friend to the scene, in spite of being in the car. 

'I’ve never seen anything like this and I’ve been here 21 years,' Sparta Police Sgt John Lamon told CBS.

Hazardous driving: Police say the two left a patch of thick black ice on the road that required half a ton of salt to melt

Police said the scheme was also to ensure that Byers could have the insurance company fix the vehicle.

'The original driver of the first vehicle that crashed and left the scene made an admission that that was their intent, was to blame it on the ice so they could collect insurance for the vehicle,' Sgt Dennis Proctor told 1010 WINS.

Both were charged with driving while intoxicated, and Byers also was hit with charges including failure to report an accident and creating a dangerous condition. Other charges are pending.

A crew had to be called to the scene to dump half a ton of salt in order to melt the ice and keep the road safe.
