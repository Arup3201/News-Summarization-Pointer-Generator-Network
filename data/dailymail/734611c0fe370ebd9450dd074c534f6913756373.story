Bolstered: The surprisingly robust pace of recovery in recent months is a boost for George Osborne

Britain's economy is growing at its fastest pace for 16 years, a report revealed yesterday.

In a sign that the recovery is gathering pace, figures showed the dominant services sector had clocked up its best month since May 1997.

It came as a report in Brussels predicted the UK would be the best performing major economy in Europe in 2013, 2014 and 2015 - outstripping even the mighty Germany.

The European Commission said Britain has ‘exceeded expectations’ this year and added that ‘the outlook is quite bright’ having ‘improved substantially since the spring’.

Combined with upbeat surveys on manufacturing and construction, the services sector figures fuelled speculation that the economy will expand by as much as 1.5 per cent in the final three months of the year.

That would be nearly double the 0.8 per cent growth rate seen in the third quarter of 2013 and outstrip anything seen since the turn of the century.

The surprisingly robust pace of recovery in recent months has bolstered hopes that the economy is finally on the mend in a boost for David Cameron and George Osborne.

Michael Saunders, an economist at banking giant Citigroup said: ‘Britain is booming’.

The strong growth could force the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner than expected in what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but relief to Britain’s army of savers.

Rates have been pegged at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 and the Bank has said there will be no increase until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower - something it said in August it did not expect until late 2016.

But it is due to publish far more optimistic forecasts next week in a sign that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. Unemployment is currently 7.7 per cent.

George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The Bank could well be swayed into bringing forward the point in time that the unemployment rate hits the 7 per cent threshold. We forecast unemployment to fall to 7 per cent by end-2015 at which point we expect a rate rise.’ 

Financial research group Markit yesterday said its index of activity in the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of UK output - rose from 60.3 in September to 62.5 in October.

That was the strongest reading since May 1997, the month when Tony Blair became Prime Minister, and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from decline.

Markit said that combined with strong reports on manufacturing and construction, October was the best month for the UK economy since the start of 1998.

David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which compiles the report with Markit, hailed ‘a sparkling start’ to the fourth quarter of the year.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said it put the UK on course for growth of 1.3 per cent in the final three months of 2013.

But others were even more upbeat, with forecasting group Capital Economics and European banking giant ING predicting growth of as much as 1.5 per cent between October and December.

The EC predicted growth of 1.3 per cent in the UK this year followed by 2.2 per cent in 2014 and 2.4 per cent in 2015 - outstripping Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the four biggest economies in the eurozone.
