A city council has created a guide to teach migrants how to behave in an apparent bid to ease tensions in the community.

The leaflet, drafted by Sheffield City Council, warns new arrivals, including Roma, against a slew of offensive habits - including urinating, defecating, spitting or having sex in the street - that upset locals.

It also contains instructions on claiming benefits and other taxpayer-funded services like healthcare and accessing translators.

There is advice on 'being a good neighbour', urging migrants not to dump litter in a neighbour's garden or allow their children to play there, hang washing on their fence and not to block drains with soiled nappies.

Sheffield City Council produced a guide on anti-social behaviour, which follows the influx of migrants, including Roma. Pictured are Ivan Kandrac, Marian Sandor and Dalibor Ziga in the Page Hall area of the city. They were pictured for an earlier, unrelated, article

Bizarrely, it also instructs them on how British people usually clean their rugs and carpets and recommends buying or hiring a vaccum cleaner and a shampooing machine.

The city has been riven by racial tension, especially in the Page Hall area, and fear of civil unrest is growing.  To make matters worse there are the first signs of vigilante action against the new Roma arrivals.

Some residents with strong views about their new neighbours have begun patrolling the streets at night to ‘gather evidence’ of anti-social behaviour and possible criminal activity.

In addition, the local Pakistani community association is running ‘official’ warden patrols between 8pm and 10pm every weekday with the intention of ‘educating’ the Roma population about ‘how to behave in England’.

Sheffield City Council defended their work with migrants and said the guide will not be released.

A spokesman said: 'Sheffield has a proud tradition of welcoming people from a large number of backgrounds and has done for many, many years. As a council we don’t take a view who should be in this country or not.

'We give advice to all people visiting or living in the city. This includes more than 55,000 students who come here.'

Warning: Mr Blunkett, the former Labour Home Secretary, has warned the increased Roma presence could spark riots

'We have not released this document at all and it is not something which we ever agreed as a council to be used as a leaflet or otherwise.'

The leaflet, which was leaked to the Daily Express, also contains advice on raising children, saying: 'Babies and young children should never be left at home alone.'

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance blasted the unpublished guide as a waste of public money.

He said: 'Spending taxpayers’ money on this frankly ludicrous guide is not only a waste of money, but there is also a danger it would exacerbate problems caused when communities do not integrate.

'Councils should not be encouraging the use of interpreters for those wishing to access public services.

'It’s vital that those coming to Britain are able to speak the language and interact with existing communities before they arrive, rather than taxpayers footing an extra burden for this kind of nonsense guide.'

Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migrationwatch UK, a non-governmental body that monitors immigration, said: 'It's pitiful state of affairs that we have had to resort to this.

'If they think they can stop the problem by producing leaflets I've got news for them: It won't.

'I can see why they feel the need to do something about it and you can't blame them for trying.'

Just weeks ago former home secretary David Blunkett warned British cities could be hit by rioting because of an influx of Roma migrants.

Mr Blunkett called on Roma migrants from Slovakia to ‘change their culture’ because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused ‘understandable tensions’ with residents in Sheffield.

Britain is home to more than 200,000 Roma migrants, most of them from Eastern Europe.

The former Home Secretary said ‘frictions’ with local people could lead to race riots.

‘If everything exploded, if things went wrong, the community would obviously be devastated,’ Mr Blunkett said.

Mr Blunkett claimed that the cultural gulf between the community in Sheffield and the Roma was far greater than that between white Britons and Pakistani immigrants.

He said: ‘The Roma youngsters have come from a background even more different culturally, because they were living in the edge of woods, not going to school, not used to the norms of everyday life. We’ve got to change that.’

Mr Blunkett said locals were entitled to ‘grumble’ about the large influx of migrants from Roma communities, but they should not ‘stir up hate’.

‘I wouldn’t want other people to put up with things I wouldn’t put up with myself,’ he said. ‘This is nothing to do with criticising people about being racist.

'By all means grumble, but don’t stir up hate.'
