Action Wrestling] British Boot Camp - competing for the chance to become
part of the TNA team.Lucy said: 'As twins we're definitely at an advantage as a tag team. Wrestling is something we love to do - and it's even better that we can do it together.

TNA or Total Non Stop Action wrestling is an entertainment business, which provides an alternative to the better known WWF or World Wrestling Federation - also an entertainment business.

There are very few differences between the two forms of wrestling; the main one being the use of hexagonal rings in TNA compared to WWF's square rings.

Lucy said: 'Boot Camp is the chance of a lifetime. Growing up we were huge fans of the Hardy Boyz [brother wrestlers, Matt and Jeff Hardy] and got to meet Jeff Hardy as part of the show.'I can't even tell you how amazing it felt, but it put it into perspective how far we've come.'

Kelly added: 'Sometimes we forget we're going to be on TV and our friends have to remind us. But it's a great opportunity to meet new people and get some new fans.'We have a special relationship with our followers. We take cupcakes to all our shows to give out. It puts a little bit of who we are into it.'Lucy said: 'When we first went out to America we wanted to do something a bit different. We're very girly and love baking so this was perfect. Now we do it all the time.'We wanted to give something back to our fans. We're so grateful for every nice thing people say to us and love reading all the nice messages.'TNA British Boot Camp starts on New Year's Day at 10pm on Challenge.
