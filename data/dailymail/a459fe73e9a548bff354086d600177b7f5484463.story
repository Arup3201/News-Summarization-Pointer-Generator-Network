They may have lost the match but the New Zealand wheelchair rugby side certainly won over the crowd with their boisterous haka performance at the Invictus Games.

The Kiwi players aggressively thumped the sides of their wheelchairs for the traditional dance as their British opponents watched on ahead of the rugby match on Saturday in London.

It was the first haka of the Invictus Games - an inaugural military Paralympics event for men and women wounded in combat.

One New Zealander wheeled himself forward and finished off the haka right in front of his British counterparts.

The British military side defeated New Zealand 17-8, causing the Kiwi side to finish the competition in fifth place.

The wheelchair haka comes just weeks after the New Zealand basketball team faced off against a bewildered team USA in the World Cup.

The haka, which is supposed to instil fear in opponents, left the Americans utterly confused by what was happening in front of them.
