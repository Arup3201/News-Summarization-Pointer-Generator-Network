A plumber lost 8st after becoming so big he could no longer fit into small spaces at work.

Neil Eaton, 32, dropped from 20st to 12st in a year by following the Caveman Diet.

He also started exercising and is now a part-time personal trainer.

Neil Eaton, 32, piled on the pounds in his late 20s until he weighed 20st and was struggling to fit into small spaces while working as a plumber. He also suffered chest pains and severe acid reflux

Mr Eaton lost 8st in a year and now weighs 12st. He lost the weight by adopting the Caveman Diet

He told MailOnline: ‘My diet was very poor – a lot of fast food and takeaways and lots of drinking.

‘It was a massive change swapping diets and it took lots of determination.

‘Now I look back at what I was eating and I think it was terrible.’

Mr Eaton, from Sheffield, piled on the pounds in his late 20s.

He took very little exercise and says he ate far too much.

He explained that for breakfast he would eat a bacon, egg, sausage and tomato sandwich.

Mr Eaton now goes to the gym regularly and does not eat processed foods, dairy products or carbohydrates

For lunch he would follow this with sandwiches and crisps.

However, he would then have a second lunch at McDonald’s or KFC.

BEFORE:

Breakfast - A bacon, egg, sausage and tomato sandwich

Lunch - Sandwiches and crisps

Second lunch - McDonald's or KFC

Dinner - Pie and chips

After dinner - Pub buffet washed down with up to 14 pints

Before bed - A kebab

Snacks - Cakes, biscuits and six or seven cans of Coca ColaAFTER:

Breakfast - Scrambled egg with spinach

Lunch - A chicken salad

Dinner - Fish and vegetables

Snacks - Nuts, seeds and vegetables

For supper he would have pie and chips and he would then go to the pub where he would have a buffet and up to 14 pints of beer.

Sometimes, he says he would even get himself a kebab on the way home from the pub.

During the day he would also snack on biscuits and cakes and he drank six to seven cans of Coca Cola a day.

He said: ‘I was feeling sluggish and tired. I got chest pains and really bad acid reflux.

‘It’s scary to think what could have happened if I had continued like that.’

Eventually, Mr Eaton realised he had to change his ways as he was struggling with his job as a plumber because he could no longer fit into tight spaces.

As a result, when he was invited to a free trial at Prime Mover gym in Sheffield, he jumped at the opportunity.

He enjoyed the trial and also attended a nutrition support workshop where he learned about the Caveman Diet.

He now does a lot of circuit training, running and interval training.

He also plays squash and badminton and goes swimming regularly.

He also decided to give the diet, which involves attempting only to eat foods similar to those eaten by prehistoric man, a go.

This sees him primarily eat meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.

He eats no processed foods, dairy products, pasta, bread or rice.

For example, he now eats scrambled egg and spinach for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch and lots of vegetables with a portion of fish for supper.

He snacks on nuts, seeds and vegetables and he only drinks on special occasions.

The Caveman Diet is also known as the Paleo - or Paleolithic - Diet.

It is based on the idea of trying to eat a diet similar to that of our ancient ancestors.

It usually centres around eating berries, vegetables, lean meats and fish.

The diet forbids foods such as cereals, beans, dairy products and pasta.

It is believed that following the diet can reduce a person's chance of getting diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

He told MailOnline: ‘During the first month on the diet I lost the bloatedness – I was feeling a lot more energetic.

‘The acid reflux went within a couple of months and after six months the chest pains had stopped too.’

He added: ‘I fully intend to keep it up as I am now a personal trainer so a lot of people look up to me – I don’t want to let them down.

‘I have to keep it up for them.’

Mr Eaton says he is now happy with his weight so he is focusing on toning instead.

He said: ‘I’ve bumped into quite a few people who have had to look twice because I look so different.

‘Doing this has inspired a lot of other people to change and it has definitely been worth it.

‘The
 health benefits have been the best thing but I also feel much more 
confident now and I can wear what I want rather than what fits.’

He added: ‘Through my personal training I want to inspire more and more people if I can.’

Mr Eaton says he can now see that his diet used to be terrible and that he was putting his health in danger

Mr Eaton is now working as a part-time personal trainer and wants to inspire others to lose weight

Mr Eaton is currently training to take part in the Rat Race Dirty Weekend at Burghley House on May 10.

This will see him run 20 miles while tackling 200 obstacles.

He is trying to raise money for LUPUS UK as his sister-in-law suffers from the autoimmune condition which causes fatigue, a skin rash, joint pain and swelling.
