Fresh off the back of last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, the latest wearables are now on display in Tokyo.

Among these high-tech gadgets is the AirScouter headset that beams images straight onto the wearer’s retina, which creates the illusion they are looking at a 13-inch display.

Fujitsu is using the expo to showcase a ring that lets wearers write notes in thin air using just their fingers, while Anicall’s Tsunagaru tag helps pet owners track and location their animals.

The AirScouter headset (pictured) beams images straight onto the wearer’s retina, which creates the illusion that they are looking at a 13-inch display 'floating' 3ft (one metre) away. This illusion is created by using a so-called focus adjustment tool that changes the depth and location of the images

The gadgets are all being demonstrated at the Wearable Device Technology Expo in Tokyo that runs until Friday.

The original AirScouter headset was developed by Brother in 2010, and the Japan-based firm is using the expo to show off its next-generation model.

This headset features a heads-up display that projects images in front of the user's eye on the lens of the glasses.

By beaming high-resolution footage straight to the retina, it makes the pixels appear as if they are on a screen situated up to 3ft (one metre) away.

The headset was designed for professionals, and the original model cost in the region of $1,966 (£1,295).

Prices for the next-generation model haven’t been announced, but it is expected to go on sale later this year.

Also on display at the event is Anicall’s Tsunagaru-call device.

The Japanese firm calls itself an ‘animal communication’ company, and its Tsunagaru gadget can be fitted to the collars of both cats and dogs.

Built-in sensors and a GPS unit track the animal’s steps, and owners can use a smartphone app to locate their pet if they're lost.

Anicall didn’t reveal pricing information, but said the device will go on sale in Japan in March. It is not known if it will also be available globally.

Yamaha is using the expo to showcase a prototype pair of pianist smart gloves made using a flexible nanomaterial.

The gloves contain 12 motion sensors that monitor the speed and movement of fingers fitted with carbon nanotubes while playing a keyboard or piano.

This information can then be used to improve playing style and speed.

Elsewhere, Recon is demonstrating its smart Jet sports glasses.

They cost $699 (£460) and feature a heads-up display that shows metrics such as calories, speed, distance and more, via a fitness app.

The headset can be attached to an existing pair of glasses, or goggles when used for skiing, for example. 

The Jet glasses additionally come with a protective case called The Hanger that stores spare lenses batteries.

Both Jawbone and Fitbit also used the event to showcase their range of fitness trackers, namely the Jawbone UP3 and Fitbit Zip.

The Jawbone UP3 uses bioimpedance sensors that measure the resistance of body tissue to electric currents.

This means the wearable can capture of a range of physiological signals including heart and respiration rate. The UP3 was originally meant to launch last year, but has been delayed. An exact release date is not known. 

Fitbit’s Zip, alternatively, is available now, and costs £49.99 in the UK, and $59.95 in the US. 

Fujitsu's ring-type wearable device (pictured) tracks and identifies the movements of the wearer's fingertips as they write in the air. It then recognises that tracing as a letter or number

Fujitsu said the ring (pictured) can be used by wearers to choose from a menu, or write memos, for example. The ring has a built-in NFC tag reader so wearers can transfer anything they write straight to a phone

It is a simple fitness tracker that monitors steps, calories and distances.

However, it doesn’t track elevation or sleep, like the more expensive Fitbit One that sells for £79.99 in the UK and $99.95.

The Zip doesn’t need to be charged, and instead comes with a watch battery that lasts for up to six months.

And among the medical wearables on display, Japan's Nihon University professor Sadao Omata is demonstrating his blood pressure monitor IC Me at the expo.

Data measured by the meter syncs with a smartphone app, and includes maximum and minimum blood pressures, both average and real-time values, pulse rate and pulse wave information.

The meter uses photo transistors to detect LED light reflected on a finger.

It then converts pulse wave data obtained from the light into a blood pressure value.

Professor Omata is hoping to sell the device later this year and is developing a new device that can breast cancer using similar light technology.
