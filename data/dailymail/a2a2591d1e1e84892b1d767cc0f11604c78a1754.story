New chapter: Boston bombing victim Jeff Bauman is releasing a book about his experiences in April

Boston
 bombing survivor Jeff Bauman has written a book that will be published a week before the first anniversary 
of the deadly blast in April.

His publisher revealed the cover of the book, 'Stronger', on Twitter on Tuesday night, ahead of Bauman's appearance at the State of the Union speech.

After heading to the Capitol for the event, Bauman tweeted: 'I wore pants for the first time in 9 
months! And I 
also met the president.'

The cover shows him standing on two prosthetic legs with 'Boston' emblazoned across his t-shirt.

The New Hampshire native, 27, lost both of his lower legs in the April 
15 attack. An iconic photo taken moments after the blast showed Bauman gray-faced with 
nothing but exposed bone below his knees.

But he has since overcome unimaginable adversities to remain positive and Grand Central Publishing will publish the book about his experiences on April 8, CBS Boston reported.

Bauman, who was working to pay off his
 student loans at the deli counter in Costco before the life-changing 
blast, worked with co-writer Bret Witter on the book.

A description on Amazon explains: 'Jeff Bauman woke up on Tuesday, April 16th 2013 and he had no legs.

Fighter: On Tuesday, Bauman, right, appeared beside Carlos Arredondo, who helped save his life after the bombings, at the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol

Back on his feet: Bauman walked on his prosethetics, left, while Arredondo, waved at Michelle Obama, right

'Just
 thirty hours prior, Jeff was surrounded by revelry at the finish line 
of the 2013 Boston Marathon. The first bomb went off at his feet as he 
awaited his girlfriend’s finish.

'When Jeff awoke days later from hours 
of surgery, rather than take stock of his now completely altered life, 
Jeff ripped out his breathing tube and tried to speak. He couldn’t.

'Jeff
 asked for a pad and paper and he wrote down seven words, "Saw the guy. 
Looked right at me", setting off one of the biggest manhunts in the 
country’s history and beginning his own brave road to recovery.'

It adds that the book aims to inspire people by sharing his experiences and his mission to walk again.

'Jeff will show the terrorists that they 
accomplished nothing with their act of cowardice and prove to the entire
 world what Boston Strong really means,' it reads.

Life-changing: Carlos Arredondo pinches Bauman's femoral artery as they rush from the blast site moments after the April 15 bombing in Boston. Bauman lost both lower legs and much of his hearing

Battle: He lost both of his lower legs in the blast and has since been fitted with prosthetic limbs

Bauman appeared at the State of the
 Union speech alongside the man who helped save him, Carlos Arredondo. The men have remained close and Bauman was pictured with his arm around the man's shoulder.

Bauman went to the marathon waiting to 
see his girlfriend cross the finish line when was close to one of the 
explosive-filled backpacks allegedly placed by the Tsarnaev brothers.

He
 was thrown by the force of the blast and opened his eyes to find 
himself in a pool of blood. He saw one of his friends look at his legs 
in horror and looked down to see his limbs were shredded.

He
 underwent an emergency amputation to remove his legs at the knees, and 
two days later, flesh was amputated until four inches above the knees.

Support: He is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, who had been running the marathon that day

Authorities have praised Bauman, who 
also lost much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev 
and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects.

'Even in the ambulance ride I was 
trying to say something, trying to say, like, "I knew who did it, I knew
 what went on",' he said in an earlier interview with NBC News. 'And 
then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.'

Bauman
 added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how 
differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no
 point.

Instead, he is focusing on his recovery, which has impressed doctors.

'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer. They were calling me 'Wolverine'.'
