Councillor Steve Hayward still claims his £4,350-a-year allowance despite living in Thailand and insists he can do his job via email and Skype

A councillor is still claiming his £4,000-a-year allowance despite living 8,500 miles from his constituency in Thailand.

Steve Hayward, a councillor for Ducklington, in Oxfordshire, insists he is still able to do his job via Skype and email, and 
has no plans to stand down until the next election in May.

Mr Hayward moved to Khao Lak, on the west coast of Thailand, from his home in Whitney in June, where he now helps run two restaurants as well as a rice and sugar farm.

He said: 'I have kept in contact with council officers, fellow councillors, constituents and others who have contacted me over this time.

'Using the telephone, e-mail and Skype I believe I have an excellent record of replying quickly.

'It has been one of my busiest years and I have been able to quickly deal with four council housing allocations and able to help in several local planning issues, mostly with satisfactory outcomes.

'I have been lucky that fellow councillors have been able to help when immediate action was necessary, much the same as if I was driving my lorry or out of the area.'

Mr Hayward's annual councillor allowance of £4,350 is being paid to him in monthly installments.

The former mayor and lorry-driver has attended just one meeting since the move, and is unable to vote unless he is present, but insists he would fly back if he was required.

Mr Hayward resigned from the Conservative Party last year after being sacked from a committee position and was deselected from his seat on Oxfordshire County Council.

In June last year Mr Hayward moved to the resort town of Khao Lak on the western coast of Thailand

Mr Hayward now owns 10 per cent shares in two restaurants as well as a share of a rice and sugar plantation

Former chairman of Ducklington parish council Gordon Clack said: 'It
 is outrageous. We keep hearing about cuts, but we never hear about cuts
 to councillor expenses.

'I spent about 12 years on our parish 
council and my home was an office, but I never claimed a penny. Now you 
have professional councillors.

'I cannot see how he can do his job. If someone choses to live abroad surely the moral thing to do is to resign.'

To seek council election a candidate 
must, on the day of their nomination, be an elector in the local 
authority area, own land or premises there, have their main place of 
work there or have lived there for the whole of 12 months before the day
 of the election.

Current rules do not allow Mr Hayward to be ousted from his post as councillor for Ducklington (pictured)

Once elected, a councillor does not have to resign if none of these criteria no longer apply.

West Oxfordshire District Council chief executive David Neudegg said: 'The minimum legal requirement is for a councillor to attend at least one council meeting in any six month period to remain in office.

'A councillor cannot be disqualified by the district council if they move out of the area. It is up to them to decide whether they should continue or resign.'
