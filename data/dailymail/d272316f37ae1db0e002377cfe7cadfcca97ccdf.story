More than 50 former female staff at a Wild-West-themed bar in in New York's Rockefeller Center have received payouts after being forced to work in a 'hyper-sexualized work environment' that 'degrad[ed] and humiliat[ed] its female employees', according to court records.

According to a lawsuit filed at Manhattan Federal Court, women working at Johnny Utah's bar were required to remove wedding and engagement rings; wear 'sexually provocative', cowboy-style clothing; take part in bawdy drinking competitions with male customers, sit on their laps, and pour alcohol into their mouths; and kiss each other while riding a bucking mechanical bull.

On one occasion, to mark Thanksgiving, women were even asked to wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce, the New York Daily News reported. The level of the settlement is not known.

Exploited: Female staff at Johnny Utah's bar in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center were allegedly forced to remove their shirts and kiss each other while riding a mechanical bull. There is no suggestion that the woman pictured is one of the plaintiffs

Total bull: The bar is famous for its mechanical bull, which has been at the centre of the sexual exploitation law suit. Female employees at Johnny Utah's were allegedly forced to dance for male customers and sit on their laps, wear sexy cowgirl outfits, and even wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce

The working environment at the bar, the suit alleged, led to the women being subjected to 'pervasive and regular unwelcome sexual comments' and advances by customers and male staff. But those who complained were criticised for not being 'team players'.

'Managers frequently remind the female servers that they are expendable and tell them that '20 other women' are willing to take their job,' court papers said.

According to the New York Daily News, female workers were also called 'ugly' or 'stupid' by male managers if they were not 'throwing the party' or looking 'attractive enough'. 

They were also forced to play drinking games with the manager of the bar and his friends, the suit says.

The bar has also been accused of secretly recording titillating images of the women, and routinely posting them on Twitter, Facebook and its own website without their consent.

'[Johnny Utah is] a hyper-sexualized work environment that increases the defendants profits by exploiting, degrading and humiliating its female employees,' said the court papers. 

'Johnny Utah's is in business of selling food and alcohol to the public, not providing adult entertainment to heterosexual men.'

Destiny Frye, one of the plaintiffs, was 19 when she began working at the bar as a hostess. Despite being under-age, she and others were allegedly ordered to drink before riding the bull. 

Much of the alleged abuse centred around Johnny Utah's famous mechanical bull, which once featured on the cartoon show Family Guy.

Court papers say that women were urged by their bosses to 'take off their shirts' and 'kiss other female employees when they ride the bull together'.

Embarrassing: Johnny Utah's mechanical bull is so notorious that it once featured on Fox Broadcasting company cartoon Family Guy. Its sexual connotations are satirised by the character Peter, who is shown wearing a bikini top

Party time: Johnny Utah's publicity posters featured sexually provocative images of women, seemingly leaving potential customers in little doubt about what to expect. Female employees were allegedly required to remove their wedding rings before starting work, and to flirt with male customers - and each other

'During the ride, the Johnny Utah's DJ periodically stops the music and announces over the microphone that if the female employees who are riding the bull "make out" with each other, there will be a free round of shots of alcohol for all customers,' the papers said. 

'The customers yell and scream for the female employees to kiss one another', and the women were 'expected to submit to the degradation'.

This is not the first time that the restaurant and bar, which is owned by John Sullivan, who also owns the popular bars McFadden's and Calico Jack's, has found itself in court. 

Over the years, a number of personal injury lawsuits have been brought on account of the mechanical bull.
