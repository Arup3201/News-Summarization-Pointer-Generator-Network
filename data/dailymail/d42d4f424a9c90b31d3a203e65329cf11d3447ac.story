Aaron Lennon is set to be the first victim of Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham cull.

The winger is available for around £7million and Premier League clubs are aware of his availability.

Stoke are understood to be leading the chase to land Lennon, but Southampton are interested too.

Mauricio Pochettino is hoping to offload the 27-year-old for £7million in January

Lennon has spent most of the season on the peripheries of Spurs first-team plans this season and it has always been in Pochettino’s thoughts to sell him this month.

The 27-year-old last featured for the club as a substitute against Besiktas in the Europa League last month, and has made just six appearances all season. 

Lennon now looks set to be the first to leave White Hart Lane in the transfer window.
