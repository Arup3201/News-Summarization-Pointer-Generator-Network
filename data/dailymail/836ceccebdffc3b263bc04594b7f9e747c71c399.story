Spending time inside a human-sized hamster ball might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but for those wanting an escape from the stresses of everyday life, this giant step-in speaker may help.

Dubbed AudioOrb, the sphere has a small hole for entry and is lined with memory foam pillows that adjust to your body shape.

It is fitted with 18 speakers and blocks outside noise, allowing you to shut off from the world while becoming 
immersed in your favourite music.

AudioOrbs look like giant hamster balls.

The sphere has a small hole for entry and is lined with memory foam pillows that adjust to a user's body shape.

It is fitted with 18 speakers and blocks outside noise letting users shut off from the world while becoming 
immersed in their favourite music.

There are only two Orbs available at the moment and the company is charging $15,000 (£9,100) for each on Indiegogo. 

The concept was created by Scandinavian creative lab ST in collaboration with experimental studio Petter Johansson Art Direction and Design.

The group is currently raising funds for the AudioOrb using an Indiegogo crowd funding campaign.

There is only one pledge tier, however, of $15,000 (£9,100) and only two AudioOrbs are currently available.

'If you've ever entered a small confined space you have also experienced the silence and solitude that you'll find inside,' explained the AudioOrbs makers.

'Spherical spaces almost completely block noise from the outside world. This was our starting point when we developed the AudioOrbs: the first spherical speaker you can enter.'

The group is also behind one of the largest iPod speaker docks ever to have been built, called the Wall of Sound 2.

The dock can produce 130dB of sound, which is the same sound output as an F-15 jet with afterburners on from 100 metres away.

To prevent it from making you deaf, the company has built in a monkey head that warns you if you're playing music too loud.

The eyes on the monkey glow red, and after five minutes of loud music, its head will pop and the music stops.

Unlke the AudioOrb, this device is ideal for those who want their music heard by everyone.
