Celtic face yet another UEFA disciplinary hearing after travelling supporters lit flares during Thursday night’s Europa League exit to Inter Milan.

Fined £7,300 by UEFA for fireworks in their last away game in Zagreb, the Parkhead club appealed to supporters to behave after an eighth UEFA fine in as many years.

Public appeals by coach Ronny Deila for self policing were ignored, however, when pyrotechnics were clearly evident in the top tier of the San Siro during the 49th minute of the 1-0 defeat.

‘That’s very disappointing,’ said Deila afterwards. ‘We have to get rid of this, it’s nothing to do with football. The fans were unbelievable today but, again, they have to behave in the right way.’

In contrast with the authorities in Scotland, UEFA operate a strict liability policy, which punishes clubs for the actions of their supporters.

Celtic reacted to their latest fine this week by releasing a statement urging supporters to stop damaging the club’s reputation in Europe.
