A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when his bicycle was hit by van has given his first ever TV interview.

Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma and fighting for his life after he decided not to wear a helmet for fear it would ruin his hairstyle.

The teenager, from Chapel St Leonards in Lincolnshire, appeared today on ITV’s This Morning with his father to talk about the progress he has made.

Ryan Smith, 17, told ITV's This Morning  he had 'come on leaps and bounds' since coming out of a four month coma in November following a crash with a van while cycling

After the accident on July 22 2013, Ryan's family released a heartbreaking picture of Ryan's father Mark cradling his son's head - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets

Ryan defied doctors who said he would never wake from the coma, and wouldn't ever be able to speak or walk

Mark Smith said that his son was now back at school, where he achieved an A in his GCSE maths.

'The school has learnt that cognitively, he is still in there. It is just a process of plucking it out,' he said.  

He is now campaigning for a change in the law to make wearing a cycle helmet compulsory, which he says will save other families the pain of the ordeal he has been through.

Beginning the interview, presenter Ruth Langsford said she ‘nearly cried’ when she went to meet Mr Smith before the show.

‘The last time we saw you Mark, you were crying,’ she said, of Mr Smith's last appearance on the show in August, a month after Ryan's accident.

She asked Ryan, who sat hand in hand with his father on the show’s red sofa, how he was feeling today and what he can remember from the accident.

Needing prompting and encouragement from his father, Ryan said: ‘Children’s Trust. Rehab. Swimming.’

Mss Langsford then joked that as she came into the make-up studio where Ryan was being prepared before the show, she caught him up to his old tricks: doing his hair.

Ryan was in a coma for four months following the accident, which happened on July 22 2013.

At the time, his family released a heart-breaking image showing Ryan’s father, Mark, cradling his son’s head as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets.

Then, in November, the family were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time.

And in April, Ryan defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust’s Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey.

Speaking today about his son’s injuries, Mark Smith said: 'Unfortunately these sorts of injuries are life-long. Ryan’s doing really well but he’s got a long way to go yet.

‘The left side side’s extremely weak still. He’s had operations on his feet to get a better angle on his feet to help him with walking. 

‘He’s left the Children’s Trust and now he’s back at school, he’s getting therapy there.’ 

Mr Smith said: ‘The school is starting to learn that cognitively, he’s still in there, and it’s a process now of plucking it out and encouraging him to do the things he can do.'

He added that Ryan’s friends have been integral in his recovery, coming to visit him every week.

‘Since we’ve been home, it’s not just about family all the time, and therapists.

‘It’s about his friends. He’s trying to emulate them again. 

'His determination has shone through since he’s been home so we’ll just keep working with that.

Ryan received rehabilitation at the Children’s Trust’s in Tadworth, Surrey but has now gone back to school where he is receiving therapy. In April this year, Ryan's was able to stand unaided for the first time.

‘And his friends have been tremendous. And that’s what he needs.’

'I've come on leaps and bounds,' Ryan added. 

Mr Smith said he never expected to be sitting on the show’s sofa, as before his last appearance on the show in August doctors had warned that Ryan might never wake up.

Mr Smith said: 'At that time it was touch and go. There’s no two ways about it. We were going through hell at that time.

‘But its mixed emotions now as you can see, look at him again now. 

'At the time I never dreamt I’d be sat with you here, especially with the main man. So its testament to Ryan’s character, that is.’

His son has defied medics with his progress, he added. He said: ‘Prognosis from day one was that he wasn’t expected to be here.

‘We were supposed to prepare for demise. Then we were told he wasn’t going to be able to do anything again.

Presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford said they hoped next time they saw Ryan, he would walk into the studio

‘He’s stuck two fingers up to quite a few prognosis. And long may that continue.’

Cycle helmets are not compulsory in Britain, so Mr Smith will continue his campaign for this law to be changed.

Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads.

Department of Transport research shows up to 16 per cent of cycling deaths could be avoided if cyclists were wearing the correct helmet.

Mr Smith said: ‘Why take the risk? You’re very exposed on one of those bikes. 

'If you put a helmet on it will minimise any impacts that should you sustain them, you won’t put your family through what we’ve been through.’
