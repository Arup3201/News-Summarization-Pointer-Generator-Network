A 7-year-old California boy's fight for survival against a cancer rarely seen in children faces even worse odds than most thanks to his mixed Asian and European heritage.

Baylor Fredrickson's family is desperately seeking a needle in a haystack donor whose bone marrow matches their ailing son's, something his mother says is 'worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot.'

Now the boy's family is in a race against time as they scramble to get all the eligible half Japanese/half German individuals tested for their suitably to be donors that they possibly can before time runs out.

Fighting the odds: 7-year-old Baylor Fredrickson is fighting leukemia for the second time. Chemotherapy didn't cure him and now a bone marrow transplant is his only hope

Searching: Baylor faces unusually rough odds in his battle because bone marrow donation is far more complicated than blood donation, especially for mixed race people like him

Baylor suffers from acute myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer that's rarely seen in people under 45.

He is now in his second round of chemotherapy to buy him time as family and friends set up bone marrow registry drives across the Bay Area in hopes they'll find a match.

'Since Baylor is Japanese & German mixed race, he will most likely need a donor who is also mixed race, Asian & Caucasian. #HAPA,' reads one of the flyers on Facebook advertising the many donor events.

Still, the Fredricksons face an uphill battle.

Baylor's
 mother Nihei Fredrickson explained to the Contra Costa Times: 'Finding a
 donor is nothing like matching blood types. bone marrow is EXTREMELY 
complex. it has to do with antigens/proteins which are located on the 
surface of the blood cell (also known as "markers"). a 10/10 marker 
match is a perfect match.'

Unfortunately
 for people like Baylor, nonprofits like the Asian American Donor 
Program have had to fight for years to try and increase awareness of 
organ and tissue donation for and within minority groups.

According to Fredrickson, the test for potential donors is easy and pain free.

Hopefully
 for her son, Mrs. Fredrickson's message will continue to help get half
 Japanese, half German donors to testing drives.

'It's a long road,' Fredrickson told the Contra Costa Times. 'A road a second-grader should not have to go through.'

Baylor Frederickson of Albany, California is battling a cancer rare for a child his age and his genetic heritage is making finding a donor difficult

Baylor will most likely need a donor who is also of Asian and European mixed heritage and perhaps specifically half German, half Japanese

The second grader has already unsuccessfully been through chemotherapy once and needs a bone marrow donation to save his life
