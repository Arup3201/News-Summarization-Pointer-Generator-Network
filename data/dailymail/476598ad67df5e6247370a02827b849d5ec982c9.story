White House arrest: Secret Service officers apprehended April Lenhart, 23, with an unregistered gun in her possession outside the White House Thursday night 

The woman was spotted walking with a holster along the north fence of the presidential residence 

The 23-year-old Michigan resident was accompanied by a man, who was not arrested and has not been identified, reported CBS. 

Secret Service Spokesman Ed Donovan said Lenhart is not cooperating with the investigation at this time.

The arrest took place shortly after President Obama delivered a televised speech about immigration reform inside the East Room.

The executive actions ease the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants and set up a clash with Republicans who vow to fight his moves.

Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said Lenhart was demonstrating along the north fence of the White House complex when authorities saw a holstered handgun on her hip.

She was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and ammunition, and carrying a pistol without a license. Hoback said she refused to make statements to authorities.

Timing: The arrest took place minutes after President Obama concluded his address to the nation on immigration reform 

On Wednesday, R.J. Kapheim was taken into custody after approaching a checkpoint one block from the White House claiming that the president had invited him.  

A search of his car yielded a rifle, ammunition. and a knife.
