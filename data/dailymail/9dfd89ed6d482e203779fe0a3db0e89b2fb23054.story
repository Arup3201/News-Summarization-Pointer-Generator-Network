A Princess Diana lookalike and her husband ran a Europe-wide black-market empire which flooded the UK alone with £6million worth of illegal veterinary drugs, a court was told yesterday.

Regine Lansley, 62, and Ronald Meddes, 73, supplied 1,800 clients from their 11-bedroom French farmhouse.

Despite being known by villagers as ‘Ronnie and Reggie’, the couple appeared the epitome of respectability.

Lansley, who hired herself out for appearances based on her similarity to the late princess, claims to be an expert horsewoman.

In her online profile for the actors’ agents Lynch Media Group, she describes herself as ‘very elegant with a dazzling smile, charismatic with an obvious “wow factor”.’

She adds: ‘People rarely believe my age and frequently say, “I wish I could be like you”. I have a certain talent and air about me that I am able to give high street clothes a designer look.’

Her husband, a disgraced ex-Lloyd’s trader and convicted fraudster, was also well known in equestrian circles and bought his wife the farmhouse, 80 miles from Paris, for her 50th birthday.

Yesterday the couple were jailed and warned they would come out penniless after proceedings to confiscate the proceeds of their crime.

Lansley was given 20 months and her husband 28 months after Croydon Crown Court heard that a raid on their farmhouse represented the largest seizure of illegal veterinary products in Europe.

Such was the scale of their illicit operation that some medicines enjoyed the largest market share in the UK over legitimate products and just one of their delivery companies transported 8.5 tons of black-market drugs into the UK in two years.

There was a threefold price mark up on some medicines brought in from India and investigators discovered paperwork showing total sales of £13.5million over a six-year period.

The couple became so greedy that even after their farmhouse was raided in 2007 they moved across the border to Belgium and resumed trading.

When that property was raided a year later they moved on again ‘undaunted’ and continued to sell while on bail.

Their UK customer list included farms, stables, kennels, hunts, shoots and veterinary practices.

The drugs they supplied included anti-inflammatories, anabolic steroids, tranquillisers, antibiotics, sedatives, painkillers and other miscellaneous products administered to horses, household pets and farm animals.

Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said: ‘It becomes a bit of a free-for-all and the food chain is placed at risk as well.

‘These animals and their welfare are being placed at risk.’

The couple evaded EU regulations by lying that the medicines were for export to Russia only.

Meddes, now of Charing, Kent, admitted 19 counts of unlawfully supplying unauthorised veterinary medicines and Lansley, who gave her address as West Brompton, West London, although the couple are still together, pleaded guilty to two counts.

Also sentenced today was a former employee of Meddes, Alex John, represented by solicitor Richard Gowthorpe of Lansbury Worthington Solicitors.

After his client received a suspended prison sentence and 200 hours unpaid community work, her lawyer said: "It is a huge relief that this prosecution has finally come to an end and without Alex being sent to prison. No-one realised this was illegal several years ago and Defra change the rules every year".
