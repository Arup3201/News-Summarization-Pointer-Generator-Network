Walkers at the top of a Japanese volcano were forced to run for their lives after it started to erupt without warning yesterday, sending a cloud of ash and rock streaming down the mountainside. 

Within seconds, the cloud covered an area more than two miles wide from the summit of Mount Ontake with witnesses claiming that visibility was reduced to zero.

Seven people are missing since yesterday's eruption which seriously injured 32 people with seven of those losing consciousness.  

Some 250 hikers were forced to run for their lives after Mount Ontake erupted yesterday lunchtime without any prior warning, covering the area in rock and ash

Seconds after the image left, visibility was reduced to almost zero as the walkers were engulfed in a cloud of volcanic dust and rock, right 

The ash cloud spread out immediately in every direction shooting thousands of feet into the sky before covering a two square mile area in dense, choking dust 

Rescuers believe that at least 40 people are stranded near the 3,067 metre summit of Mount Ontake due to the lingering ash cloud.

Sohei Hanamura, crisis management official in the Nagano prefecture which controls the area said police, fire, and military rescue workers can only ascend the mountain on foot as it is too dangerous to deploy helicopters to the area. 

Rescuers fear that the helicopters would suffer catastrophic engine damage if they ingested the highly abrasive volcanic dust.   

The 3,067 metre mountain is 125 miles west of Tokyo and has already forced airlines to divert aircraft from the area. 

One of the hikers was filming the mountain at the time of the eruption and captured some of the terrified walkers as they fled for their lives. 

Only a matter of seconds after hearing the noise, the cloud of abrasive dust closes in on them, blocking out the day light. As the cloud struck, the person holding the camera is forced to turn away from the onrushing dust and dive to the ground in order to breathe. 

More than 250 people were on the mountain when the volcano started to erupt yesterday lunchtime forcing walkers to improvise protective masks 

Those near the bottom of the mountain were able to continue downwards, but an estimated 40 of those near the summit were stranded with seven reported missing 

The camera shows that instantly every exposed area in the mountain top is soon covered in the dust and people can be heard coughing and spluttering. 

Mikio Oguro, an NHK journalist who was on the slope on an unrelated assignment, told the station that he saw massive smoke coming out of the crater, blocking sunlight and reducing visibility to zero.

He said: 'Massive ash suddenly fell and the entire area was totally covered with ash," he said by phone. He and his crew had to use headlights to find a lodge to take refuge.

'My colleagues later told me that they thought they might die.' 

Rescuers said that 32 people were seriously injured while seven of those were rendered unconscious with a further seven reported missing since yesterday 

Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has instructed the military to launch a rescue operation to escort the stranded walkers to safety in case the situation deteriorates 

Mount Ontake, pictured, began erupting round noon on Friday spewing rocks and ash over a two-mile radius of the mountain's summit

Japan's meteorological agency raised the alert level for Mount Ontake to three on a scale of one to five. It warned people to stay away from the mountain, saying ash and other debris could fall up to 2.5 miles away.

One eyewitness told Japanese TV channel NHK: 'It was like thunder. I heard boom, boom, then everything went dark.' 

So far there has been no sign of any lava in the volcano, which last erupted in 2007, but scientists are monitoring the situation closely. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe returned earlier today from a visit to the US. He has instructed the military to begin rescuing the stranded hikers and remove them from the area in case the situation deteriorates further. 

Mr Abe said: 'Nearly 200 people are in the process of descending the mountain, but we are still trying to figure out details. I instructed to do all we can to rescue the people affected and secure the safety of the trekkers.

Nagano police sent a team of 80 to the mountain to assist the climbers who were making their way down, while Kiso Prefectural Hospital, near the mountain, said it had dispatched a medical emergency team.

The 3,067 metre Mount Ontake is about 120 miles west of Tokyo and is popular with hikers and adventurous tourists looking for a walking holiday 

Walkers in the area were forced to improvise to protect themselves from the volcanic ash which was falling from the sky following yesterday's eruption 

A TV crew working in the area at the time of an unrelated story thought they were going to be killed when the ash and rocks began falling from the sky

A hospital official said: 'We expect a lot of injured people so we are now getting ready for their arrival.'

More than five hours after the initial eruption, the thick ash cloud showed no signs of abating, NHK TV showed.

Mari Tezuka, who works at a mountain rescue hut on the mountain said: It's all white outside, looks like it has snowed. There is very bad visibility and we can't see the top of the mountain,

'All we can do now is shut up the hut and then we are planning on coming down... This is a busy season because of the changing autumn leaves. It's one of our busiest seasons.'

Scientists said there has not been any lava seen yet during this most recent event although Mount Ontake last erupted back in 2007 

Mount Ontake is 120 miles west of Tokyo although so far flights in and out of the city have not been affected by the eruption although local flight restrictions are in place

Poisonous gases and ash are being pumped thousands of feet into the sky as the volcano threatens to explode for the first time in almost a decade
