The son of a disgraced former Virginia governor has been charged with drunk driving, authorities have revealed.

Bobby Ryan McDonnell was arrested at 3.25am on Thursday in Virginia Beach and refused to take a blood test.

According to The Washington Post the 23-year-old was detained and released at 11am on a non-secured bond. 

In September his father, Bob McDonnell, and mother Maureen were convicted on public corruption charges.

They lent the prestige of the governor's office to Richmond businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. in exchange for $177,000 in loans, vacations and luxury goods.

As the case went on, members of his family were forced to take the stand. 

Bobby was made to testify as a witness for the prosecution and described his father’s insistence that his son return a golf bag and golf shoes given to him by Williams.

A federal jury in Richmond convicted  McDonnell of 11 of the 13 counts he faced; Maureen McDonnell was convicted of nine of the 13 counts she faced. Both bowed their heads and wept as the court clerk read a chorus of 'guilty' verdicts.

Widely considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign, McDonnell was reduced to living with the family's priest in a church rectory during the trial.

 Now he and his wife face up to 20 years in prison for each conspiracy, fraud and bribery conviction. Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 6. 

The couple's defense strategy depended in large part on convincing jurors that their marriage itself was a fraud and that they were unable to speak to each other, let alone conspire to accept bribes. They left the courtroom separately — first Bob and then Maureen, who hugged one of her daughters and wept loudly on the way out.

Bob McDonnell was ashen as he was mobbed by TV cameras before climbing into a waiting blue Mercedes.

'All I can say is that my trust remains in the Lord,' he said quietly. His attorney said he would appeal.
