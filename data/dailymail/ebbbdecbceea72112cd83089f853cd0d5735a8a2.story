Having a drag: Guests who visit the zoo throw pre-lit cigarette butts to the adult male known as Kirno

The 14-year-old was photographed puffing on a fag at Taru Jurug Zoo in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia.

Guests are throwing pre-lit cigarette butts to the adult male known as Kirno then laughing as he smokes like a human.

It is thought he learnt how to smoke by imitating zoo visitors.

And it comes just two years after another of the zoo's orangutans, Tori, had to be moved to an island to quit her cigarette habit.

A zoo spokesperson said: 'It is difficult to prevent the visitors from giving cigarettes to Kirno.

'Many visitors misbehave. Smoking habits in orangutans are dangerous and can lead to a lack of appetite.'

The photographer Agoes Rudianto who captured the images said: 'I was photographing the animals at the zoo when I got to Kirno's cage and spotted him smoking.

'I saw there were visitors taking pictures on their phones and laughing.'

Dr Grainne McEntee, head of Ooperations at Orangutan Protection Foundation, added: 'Mimicry is a well-known behavioural characteristic in primates. It is how they learn, much as human children do.

'In
 a captive environment, with little to do, intelligent primates commonly
 resort to mimicry to keep themselves occupied, and whilst we accept 
zoos as a normal part of present day society, it is nonetheless very sad
 to witness captive animals being presented with the opportunity to copy
 some of the least acceptable aspects of human behaviour.'

Hanging out: In a captive environment, with little to do, intelligent primates commonly resort to mimicry to keep themselves occupied

Relax: Kirno enjoys a puff on a cigarette while he hangs out in a tree

Caught in the act: Photographer Agoes Rudianto spotted Kirno smoking in the zoo in central Java Indonesia

Exhale: Smoke can be seen billowing from the orangutan's mouth as he sits back on some grass

Inhale: Kirno has a crafty cigarette by some water surrounded by foliage

Chain smoker: Kirno is shrouded by a cloud of smoke as he smokes another cigarette

Break: The 14-year-old adult male appears to really enjoy his smoke breaks

Unhealthy: The male orangutan's habit is proving a big draw for tourists who visit the zoo

Bad habit: The 14-year-old is now said to be smoking dozens of cigarettes a day

Orangutans are among the most 
intelligent primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and 
construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage.

But they are also the most solitary of the 
great apes, with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and 
their dependent offspring, who stay together for the first two years.

Native to Indonesia and Malaysia, orangutans are currently found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.

They are the two exclusively Asian species of extant great apes.

Orangutans spend most of their time in trees. Their hair is typically reddish-brown, instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas.

And males and females differ in size and appearance - dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals.

Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females.

Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs.

They can live over 30 years in both the wild and captivity.
