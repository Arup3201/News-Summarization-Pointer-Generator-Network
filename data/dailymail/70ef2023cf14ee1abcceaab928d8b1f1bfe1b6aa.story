Antoine Griezmann scored twice and Koke had a hand in three goals as Atletico Madrid cruised to a 4-2 win against Cordoba.

Griezmann put Atletico ahead just before the break but Nabil Ghilas grabbed the first of his two goals to level things up shortly after the interval.

Griezmann's second restored the home side's lead and further goals from Mario Mandzukic and Raul Garcia put the result beyond doubt before Ghilas scored his second.

Atletico started on the front foot and Arda Turan dragged a shot wide before Koke hit the bar from outside the area.

Guilherme Siqueira, Gabi and Turan then all brought saves from Juan Carlos before Atletico took the lead a minute before the break as Griezmann netted his first Primera Division goal.

Koke delivered a free-kick from the left touchline and Aleksandar Pantic's headed clearance only went as far as the Frenchman, who brought the ball under control brilliantly with his right foot and fired home with his left courtesy of a huge deflection.

The equaliser also came from a set-piece as the visitors levelled things up in the 54th minute. Fidel whipped in a corner and Ghilas was left completely unmarked at the back post to head home.

Cordoba were level for just four minutes, though, as Griezmann scored his second. Some good work down the right resulted in Juanfran supplying a cross and Griezmann was on hand to head past Juan Carlos, who got a hand to the ball but could not keep it out.

And just four minutes later it was 3-1 with a Koke free-kick again doing the damage. The Spain international delivered from the left and when Juan Carlos came to punch and missed, Mandzukic hardly had to jump to head into the empty net.

The champions dominated proceedings for the remainder of the half and it was no surprise when the fourth goal arrived nine minutes from time.

Koke was again the provider as he crossed from the left and Raul Garcia met the ball with a glancing near-post header which flashed across the face of goal and in.

Ghilas grabbed his second in the 87th minute when he capitalised on a poor clearance by Juanfran to hammer home but it proved no more than a consolation.
