For less than $1million, you can live in a piece of American history by buying up one of the four homes currently for sale on the nation's oldest housing block.

Currently there are three homes for sale on Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia's historic Old City neighborhood, with another home expected to hit the market by mid-August. 

'Our nation's oldest residential street', which dates back to 1702, was named after Jeremiah Elfreth, an 18th century blacksmith and property owner.

American history: Elfreth's Alley is the oldest continually residential street in the United States. The four homes currently for sale on the alley range in price from $649,000 to $850,000

The 32 Georgian and Federal Style homes on either side of the cobblestone alley were built between 1728 and 1836 for tradesmen and their families.

The early owners included shipwrights, silver and pewter smiths, glassblowers and furniture builders. 

The demographics on the street changed over the centuries and became predominantly Irish in the 1900s, when more immigrants were moving to that area of town. 

In 1932, the Elfreth's Alley Association was formed to preserve the street's historic homes and save them from demolition. The EAA also restored the street's original name, after it was changed to Cherry Street for some years. The street has been designated a National Historic Landmark with it's own museum at 124-126 Elfreth's Alley.

Current homeowners on the street continue to share the history of their street with the public, by opening their homes for tours in June and around Christmas.

Realtor Adam Atacan told Philly.com that the currently surplus of homes for sale on the street is unusual in that the street has averaged one home sale every two years since 1992.

But he notes that there has been increased buying and selling activity in the past few years. In the last 18 months, three homes on the street have been sold.

The current homes for sale are also rare since they are the more modern-sized homes on the north side of the street.

'Homes on the north side of the street are larger – they’re built 
federal style – and slightly newer, so folks tend to hold on to them 
more,' he said.

Realtors say the spike in 'for sale' signs probably indicate a confidence in the improving real estate market. 

This is the fourth time in 20 years that this many properties on Elfreth's Alley have been available at the same time.

Listing price $795,000Square footage: 2,600Three bedrooms, three bathrooms

Old-world features: 123 Elfreth's Alley is called the Baker's House, for the original brick oven in the basement that was used by the early owners to bake for the neighborhood

The Federal Style home with red shingles as 123 Elfreth's Alley is called the 'Baker's House' since a large brick oven still in the basement is where the early owners baked for the neighborhood.

A living room, dining room and eat-in kitchen with garden access are located on the first floor, while the master bedroom is located on the second floor.

The master bedroom comes with three closets and an adjacent den with built-in bookcases.

The master bath is decked out with marble finishes and a Jacuzzi tub.

Two other bedrooms are found up another floor, along with a sitting room and full bathroom.

An enclosed stairway on the third floor leads to a private roof deck that overlooks some of Old City's landmarks like Christ Church steeple and Ben Franklin Bridge.

The listing agent points out that it's the perfect place to watch Fourth of July fireworks along the Delaware River.

The home's basement has also been fully-renovated and turned into a family/media room with full bathroom, exposed beam ceiling and the original brick oven.

There are five fireplaces total in the house alone with all new appliances.

As a perk, the homeowners are offering to pay for the buyer's dedicated parking spot on the alley for the first year.

Current owners Amy Bluemle and David Cohen told The Republic that they love the house they've owned since 2001, but are looking to find something with more space for their growing sons.

Coming soon: 109 Elfreth's Alley has not yet hit the market, but the real estate agent plans to list it by mid-August

This property at the eastern side of the street has not yet officially hit the market, but listing agent Frank L DeFazio plans to put it up by mid-August.

The home was abandoned in 2008, in the middle of an addition to the back of the home and sat vacant for years.

During that time the home succumbed damage by water infiltration, mold infestation and vandalism and went into foreclosure in 2010.

But the home found new life last year when an optometrist and his wife decided to buy the historic house and remodel it.

'He bought it and is currently renovating it,' DeFazio told Yahoo. 'I'm going to list it within 30 days.'

DeFazio says he's confident he will sell the home with private parking an an outdoor courtyard, but the house's location on a popular tourist thoroughfare may scare off some potential buyers.

'Tours are constantly going up and down the cobblestone street,' he said. 'Every morning, someone is looking through your window. It will be interesting to see if there’s high demand.'
