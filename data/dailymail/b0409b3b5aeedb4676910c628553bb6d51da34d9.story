This is the shocking moment when a powerful tornado completely destroyed a home as it swept through Illinois last week.

The incident was captured by a security camera at a service station in Diamond, in the Midwestern state, which was ravished by a series of powerful storms on Sunday.

The blue house’s demise is shown in a 30-second video which shows it swept off the ground by the tornado, leaving nothing but a pile of debris where it once stood.

Calm before the storm: The house still stands as the strong winds sweep through Diamond, Illinois

Across the American Midwest, eight people died, dozens were injured and hundreds of homes were destroyed when at least 60 tornadoes hit the region last weekend.

At least 16 of these wreaked havoc in the state of Illinois, ABC 7 Chicago reported.

States of emergency had to be issued in seven Illinois counties in the wake of a series of the storms that flipped over cars and uprooted trees.

In Diamond county, where the video was filmed, about 220 homes and buildings were damaged from Sunday's tornado.

The EF-2 tornado had reported winds between 111 mph and 135 mph.

‘Volunteers have been coming in from all over the state and you'll see them and it's heartwarming and we're grateful for them,’ Diamond Mayor Teresa Kernc told ABC 7.

The blue house destroyed in Diamond disappeared within a few seconds in the powerful winds.

As debris is seen flying past the service station, the tornado looms in the background before devouring the house.

No one was living in the house at the time, according to the person who uploaded it to YouTube.
