She might be wearing her party’s colour, but Penny Mordaunt’s swimsuit reveals a little more than her political allegiance.

The MP, usually seen in trouser suits and buttoned-up blouses, was posing in her first official photos for celebrity diving show Splash!

She is set to compete in Saturday night’s episode of the programme, which suffered poor ratings this weekend when it went head to head with BBC1’s The Voice.

Taking the plunge: MP Penny Mordaunt is mentored by Tom Daley as she trains ahead of her appearance in ITV celebrity diving show Splash!

The ITV show was watched by only 
3.07million, while 8.37million tuned in to see Kylie Minogue make her 
debut as a judge on The Voice. After a second series failed to impress, 
the singing contest’s producers recruited Miss Minogue to draw in 
viewers – and she did not disappoint, helping to make it the most 
watched show on Saturday.

Miss
 Mordaunt’s appearance as a celebrity diver is a far cry from her roles 
as parliamentary private secretary to defence secretary Philip Hammond 
and MP for Portsmouth North.

The
 40-year-old joked that ‘bobbing up and down’ to ask questions in 
Parliament may have toned her thighs, but admitted she was unprepared 
for the gruelling training.

She
 said it was ‘radically different’ to her job but added: ‘I think you 
have to be quite brave in politics, you have to be very focused on your 
values, and some of those skills might be necessary when I’m on the high
 board.’

Her participation 
was criticised by Labour’s John Ferrett – due to challenge her at the 
next general election – who described it as ‘truly astonishing’.

‘Truly astonishing. Whilst workers rallying to 
save 1,000 jobs, their MP has been training for celebrity game show', he Tweeted in reference to the threat to around 940 jobs as a result of a 
decision by BAE Systems to move shipbuilding to Scotland.

The MP, who is parliamentary private secretary to defence secretary 
Philip Hammond, plans to donate her fee to help 
renovate a local lido, and to several Armed Forces charities.

Miss
 Mordaunt, a former magician's assistant and Royal Navy reservist, has previously expressed her fears over taking part in the show, but said she was looking forwards to taking to the water.

Miss
 Mordaunt said: ‘I have the elegance and drive of a paving slab, but my 
navy training has certainly given me the guts to take on the challenge 
head on.

‘Not only is Splash! a great personal development 
experience but it also seemed like the perfect way to fund raise for a 
charity I'm very passionate about - the Hilsea Lido in Portsmouth which 
is being renovated by the community.

‘I will be donating my fee for the programme to assist with the renovations.’

First
 elected as an MP in 2010, Miss Mordaunt, lists ‘amateur astronomer’ 
among her interests on her Twitter profile which is bound to unleash 
gags about heavenly bodies in anticipation of her appearance.

Miss
 Mordaunt, who spoke at Prime Minister's Questions as her participation 
in the show was being announced by ITV, once topped a website poll of 
the sexiest female MPs.

She is the latest in a long line of politicians to agree to take part in a reality television show in an attempt to raise their profile.

Fellow
 Conservative Nadine Dorries landed herself in hot water when she jetted
 off to the Australian jungle to take part in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me 
Out Of Here.

Former Lib Dem MP Julia Goldsworthy raised her profile in 2006 when she took part in Channel 4’s The Games.

Nervous: Speaking about her forthcoming appearance on the show, Miss Mourdaunt said she have the 'elegance and drive of a paving slab'
