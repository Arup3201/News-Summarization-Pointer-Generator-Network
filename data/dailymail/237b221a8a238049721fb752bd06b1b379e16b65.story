Seeing any professional athlete up close and personal always makes you feel that bit more insignificant. And pudgier.

But seeing 20-odd American soccer players in the flesh makes you wonder if you are in fact a part of the same species. They are, quite simply, awesome-looking.

Kyle Beckerman, the Real Salt Lake star, is 32 but looks 10 years younger and more like a surfer dude than a defensive midfielder thanks to a fine head of dreadlocks. Think Cobi Jones at Coventry City circa 1994.

Goalkeeper Brad Guzan has come a long way from his first club, South Carolina Gamecocks

You were expecting Beckerman to finish each sentence with ‘narly’ but this is a player who can boast three appearances at last summer’s World Cup so he is to be respected.

Some of the younger members of Jurgen Klinsmann’s experimental squad resembled Hollister models just as much as strikers or defenders. But Brad Guzan, well, he definitely looks like a goalkeeper. Big bald head. Big mushy nose. Big, big hands.

The Illinois native has come a long way from his first club, South Carolina Gamecocks, to reach the point where he is now first-choice with Aston Villa. Not that he feels like a true No 1.

‘I don’t know, I don’t know if I’ll ever feel like one,’ the 30-year-old said pitchside at Aviva Stadium. ‘Being in the Premier League, being with the national team, you are constantly trying to prove yourself. When you get complacent, that’s when you lose the spring in your step. It’s always about moving on.

'For me, it’s trying to prove week in week out that I am justifying the manager’s selection. So for me, I don’t necessarily look at myself as a No 1. I want to improve my own play and then justify the manager’s selection. And you do that by playing well, making saves in any way you can.’

Focused Guzan refuses to take it for granted being No 1 for club and country

He dislodged Shay Given at Villa Park and with his club-mate likely to feature in a much-changed Republic of Ireland starting XI, they will be on opposing sides. The competition for places hasn’t soured the feeling between the two men. ‘You’re fighting for playing time but our relationship has been very good, both on and off the pitch,’ Guzan insisted.

‘For me, I’ve been very fortunate to work with him for so long now, his resume speaks for itself, what he’s done, not only at club level but at international level.

‘It speaks volumes for him as a professional.’

And Roy (there was always going to be a question about Roy), what’s it like working with him?

‘Obviously he’s a passionate guy who wants to win so for the past couple of months now, working with him at Villa, he brings that intensity, brings that passion to training and into matches and that’s what you want within a training ground.’

Guzan has certainly impressed his assistant manager at club level, so much so that Keane described the American as a ‘real man’ and one of the few ‘personalties’ left in the game.

‘Yeah! I mean, listen, football is a man’s game, you have to be able to take the good with the bad and the bad with the good,’ he continued.

‘I’ve always said I’m very fortunate to be in the position I’m at, coming from America, starting in MLS and now being able to play in the Premier League, week in and week out.

‘I’m very lucky and you don’t take any of that for granted. Today is an another example of that, being able to represent your country is an honour.

‘So it’s always nice when you hear kind words but at the same time you’re always looking to get better and improve, and to help your team.’

Spoken like a true pro.
