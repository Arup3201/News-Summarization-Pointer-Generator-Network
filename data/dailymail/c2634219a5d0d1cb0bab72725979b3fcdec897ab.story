The pilot who flew Ebola patient Nancy Writebol the 5,000 miles from Liberia to the U.S. said today that he had no regrets about the risky mission and that he was honored to bring her home. 

Captain Randy Davis told ABC: 'If I had this to do over again, I would be one of the first to volunteer.' 

Mrs Writebol arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday where she was stretchered into a specially-quarantined wing by medics in biohazard suits.

Captain Randy Davis, who flew Ebola patient Nancy Writebol back to the U.S. from Liberia, said today it was an honor to perform the task and he would volunteer again if needed 

Nancy Writebol, an American aid worker, is transported into Emory University Hospital on Tuesday completely covered. The two medics transporting the 59-year-old Ebola patient wore protective suits and masks

She had traveled in a chartered jet in a portable, disposable bed. Captain Davis said that the bed allowed Mrs Writebol to be comfortable on the long flight but also kept the crew safe. 

The captain had little hesitation flying with Mrs Writebol as a passenger, despite the deadly risk of Ebola on board.

'I think everybody everywhere would agree that you'd like to try to help people who are so selfless,' Captain Davis said to ABC News.

American medical teams were taking no chances with Ebola which has no known cure and is fatal in 90 per cent of patients.

Mrs Writebol, a 59-year-old aid worker, was wheeled into the unit covered from head-to-toe in protective covering and with her eyes closed.

She appeared to be in a more serious condition that her colleague who contracted Ebola, Dr Kent Brantly, who had been seen walking into the hospital on Saturday.

The hospital released an encouraging statement on Wednesday revealing that Mrs Writebol was eating and speaking. 

Her sons are with her at the hospital and her husband is traveling back to the U.S. from Liberia.

An Emory University Hospital spokesman also revealed that Mrs Writebol had walked on to the plane in Liberia. 

Mrs Writebol showed some improvement this past weekend and even asked for Liberian potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said.

Nancy Writebol and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina when she contracted the deadly virus. Her husband is currently on his way home from Liberia to be at her bedside 

The two Americans infected with Ebola are receiving an experimental drug so novel that it has never been tested for safety in humans.

The experimental treatment is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, with funding from the government.

The treatment is aimed at boosting the immune system’s efforts to fight off the virus. It is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the Ebola virus.

It’s unclear whether the experimental treatment played a part in the recent improvements in the aid workers’ medical conditions. 

The World Health Organization said today that 932 people have now died from Ebola - rising from the 887 deaths reported two days ago.   

Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital after receiving a dose of an experimental serum. His colleague, Nancy Writebol, joined him at the pioneering hospital on Tuesday
