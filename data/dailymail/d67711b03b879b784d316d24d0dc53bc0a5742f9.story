Chocolate cupcakes topped with peanut butter cream - it's a recipe that would have most foodies drooling ... until they realised these sweet treats are stuffed with crickets.

Former Great British Bake Off contestant Glenn Cosby has created a dish containing edible insects.

He dreamed up the concoction as part of Rentokil's Pestaurant Bug Off competition - and can be seen making it in the footage. The winning recipe will be dished up to the public.

Mr Cosby said: ‘The crickets have a lovely crunch to them, they go well with nuts, and they really take up the caramel flavour. They should give a bit of texture as well as a nutty flavour on top.’

He starts off by making the sponge with butter, flour, sugar and eggs. He adds baking powder and cocoa, mixes it all together and pops it in the oven.

Mr Cosby then mixes the peanut butter with cream and in a frying pan he melts sugar to make caramel, adding hundreds of dried crickets to the mix.

He said: ‘Crickets are perfect for this. They’re a superfood too – they’ve got more protein and fewer calories than beef or chicken.’

After the insects are caramelised, he tops the cupcakes with the crunchy crickets.

Tasting his creation, he concludes: ‘The peanut butter actually worked pretty well with the crickets. They’ve got a nice bit of crunch.’

Ex co-stars Holly Bell and Ruth Clemens have also joined in Rentokil's Pestaurant Bug Off competition.

Ms Bell opted for meal worms in her brownies, while Ms Clemens went for an Early Bird Breakfast Pie using bamboo worms.

Rentokil's Pestaurant 2014 will take place at London's One New Change on August 21.
