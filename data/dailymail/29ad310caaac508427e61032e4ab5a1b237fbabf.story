Hugo Lloris has insisted that the current France team is intent on writing its own page in history by knocking Germany out of the World Cup on Friday.

The build-up to the quarter-final has been dominated by the controversy caused in 1982 when German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher knocked Patrick Battiston unconscious and the talk in France has been of the need to avenge that incident.

But Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris, the France captain, says that the team are more concerned with progressing to the semi-finals.

He said: ‘As far as we’re concerned, 
we’re living in the present. There is a long history between both 
nations but we want to write our own history for these finals. I’m 
excited and I’m sure the rest of the team feels the same. We don’t play 
the World Cup every year and this is a major opportunity to play against
 one  of the favourites.

‘We’re not afraid of anything. It’s a sheer 
joy to play Germany in the quarter-finals and we want to win for our 
friends, our relatives, our families and for France.’

Germany also 
knocked out France in the 1986 semi-finals in Mexico and France manager 
Didier Deschamps echoed his captain’s call to ignore the precedents of 
the past. ‘There is no pressure,’ said Deschamps .

‘I don’t have 
to tell the players anything. They’re just thrilled because they’re 
going to play a World Cup quarter-final. History is what has been and we
 will try to write a new page of history.’

Deschamps said that this 
new generation of French players have learned to embrace the honour and 
responsibility of playing for the national team following the debacle of
 2010, when Nicolas Anelka was sent home by the management and the team 
went on strike in protest. 

Deschamps said: ‘Our players are in 
major European clubs, so we had to make them more united, to ensure that
 they had the same philosophy, the same objectives and to understand the
 fact that to be in the France team means they have a number of duties 
and responsibilities. But spirits have been high since the beginning of 
our preparations.’

Deschamps will bring back Liverpool’s Mamadou 
Sakho, who has recovered from a leg injury, in central defence at the 
expense of Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny today while striker Olivier 
Giroud could make way for Antoine Griezmann, who made a big impact as a 
substitute in the second-round win over Nigeria.
