These dramatic images reveal how a distressed pregnant Syrian refugee was last night rescued by a British-based £500million luxury cruise ship 100 miles off the coast of Sicily.

More than 150 terrified men, woman and children fleeing the fighting were in danger as a boat carrying them across the Mediterranean began to sink.

The heavily-pregnant woman was also on board, but the 113,000-tonne and 950ft-long Crown Princess - which is based in Southampton, Hampshire - was passing by chance.

Saved: The distressed pregnant Syrian refugee was rescued by the British-based Crown Princess ship

Helping hand: The woman was taken aboard the cruise ship and given emergency medical treatment

Fearful: Dozens of terrified men, woman and children fleeing the fighting were in great danger on their boat

The woman was taken aboard the cruise 
ship where its medical team were able to give emergency treatment. Later
on she was lifted off the Crown Princess into a helicopter hovering 
over the deck.

The helicopter soon touched down at a hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania where the woman gave birth to a baby girl.

The mother was among 1.5million women and children who have escaped from Syria. This is a figure putting huge strain on refugee camps - some of which have no sanitation or fixed water supply.

The
Guardia di Finanza, an Italian law enforcement agency responsible for 
dealing with smuggling, were called out to attend to the panic-stricken 
refugees.

A Guardia 
spokesman said: ‘The boat had been spotted 100 miles off the cost of 
Sicily by navy aircraft. The migrants, 94 men, 20 women and 44 children,
were transferred to two of our vessels.

‘A woman, in advanced pregnancy and 
requiring immediate care, was taken on board the Crown Princess cruise 
ship and rescued by the ship's doctor.

‘She was later transported by ambulance to the hospital in Catania where she gave birth to a baby girl.’

The Crown Princess is one of the largest Princess ships, with room for 3,080 passengers and has nearly 900 balconies.

It left Southampton on September 9 on a voyage to the Mediterranean and is due back on September 26.

The
cruise ship, which entered service seven years ago, has been a regular 
sight alongside the port of Southampton during the summer.

Luxurious: The Crown Princess is one of the largest Princess ships, with room for some 3,080 passengers

In port: The ship left Southampton on September 9 on a voyage and is due back next week on September 26

It is scheduled to call at Southampton again before departing for Florida for a programme of Caribbean cruises.

The extraordinary scenes came as Foreign Secretary William Hague said today that Britain is willing to send experts to Syria to assist international efforts to rid the Assad regime of chemical weapons.

But Mr Hague ruled out UK troops being deployed to provide them with security, adding that such action might create strong feelings within Syria and alternative arrangements would be looked at.

Under an agreement between the United States and Russia, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's regime is required to submit a full inventory of its chemical stockpile by the end of the week.

A staggering 6 million Syrians, nearly a third of Syria’s pre-war population of 20 million, have been torn from their homes since the start of two year long conflict, .

Almost 5,000 Syrians are fleeing into neighbouring countries every day, and UN officials have warned of the need for a big increase in humanitarian aid.

The UN says that 
2 million Syrians have registered as refugees in the region - including 716,000
in Lebanon, 515,000 in Jordan, 460,000 in Turkey, 168,000 in Iraqi Kurdistan and 
110,000 in Egypt.

More than half of them are children. Women and children together make up three-quarters of the refugee population and the UN says most have arrived with 'no more than the clothes on their backs'.

The US, the UK and others blame Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for a sarin gas attack on August 21 in the suburbs of the capital Damascus. Mr Assad, supported by Russia, denies the charge, blaming Syrian rebels. The UN has called the attack a war crime but has not assigned blame.

An estimated 1,400 people died in the attack. Overcrowding in the refugee camps has intensified since the chemical attack as tens of 
thousands more Syrians have joined the exodus. Many of those displaced by fighting are now desperate to seek refuge further afield, so pitiful are conditions in the camps.

Trouble in Syria began in 2011 after 15 schoolchildren were allegedly tortured for writing anti-government graffiti on a wall. The army opened fire on protesters and killed four people. Anger over the killings soon spread.

More than 110,000 people have been killed so far in the conflict.

As more Syrians escape from the country, huge strain is being placed on the communities housing them in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. At Lebanon’s largest camp in the Bekaa Valley, there is no sanitation or fixed water supply and food is in short supply. There are also fears that some women are being sexually exploited.

Humanitarian aid organisations including the International Committee of the Red Cross have had convoys of food and medication destined for inside Syria attacked.
