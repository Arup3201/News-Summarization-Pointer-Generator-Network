A pet pug died during a Channel crossing on a P&O ferry after he was banned from leaving the car - despite temperatures soaring to 30 degrees.

Kirsty Wallace's dog Merlin and two of Ms Wallace's other dogs had to be kept in the vehicle during the journey from Calais to Dover on Friday - one of the hottest days of the year.

When Ms Wallace returned to her car after the four-and-a-half hour crossing on the Spirit of France, the three-year-old dog had died and could not be resuscitated.

Pet pug Merlin, three, died on board a P&O ferry during a crossing 
between Calais and Dover after having to be left in his owner Kirsty 
Wallace's car for the journey - while it was 30 degrees outside

Now more than 6,200 people have signed a 
petition set up after Merlin's death, which is calling for dogs to be 
allowed on the passenger deck of the ferries.

The Government warns that dogs should 
not be kept in cars for more than a few minutes once the temperatures 
exceeds 25 degrees as it can lead to distress and suffering.

It warns that temperatures inside cars can be double that of outside temperatures, due to the greenhouse effect.

P&O Ferries said it was a 'distressing' incident but that the company had followed the rules.

Nina Gadsdon, a friend of Ms Wallace who set up the campaign, alleges the death of Merlin is 'not an isolated incident'.

The woman, from Aldershot, Hampshire, intends on handing the petition to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to 
'ensure animal welfare is taken into account'.

More than 6,000 people have now signed a petition set up by Ms Wallace's friend Nina Gadsdon calling for dogs to be allowed onto the passenger deck of ferries

At the start of the petition, she wrote: 'Yesterday, a friend’s dog died 
on a cross channel ferry run by P&O due to heat exposure, they came 
down to their car after the crossing to find one of their 
beloved pet's dead, this is not an isolated incident.

P&O Ferries allow passengers to take animals on board from £15 each way.

On
 the website, it says: 'Please note that pets must remain in the vehicle
 - Foot passengers are not permitted to travel with pets.'

It will also not accept pets which are travelling without their owners.

P&O said all its procedures regarding pets travel are governed by DEFRA.

Severl
 pets - including rabbits - are eligible to be taken on board, as long 
as it is a credited company and route, such as P&O.

On
 the Government website, in the section about pet travel, it says: 
'Animals should never be left in vehicles in direct strong sunshine 
and/or high temperatures as it is difficult to ensure sufficient 
ventilation to keep them cool.

'Unless
 animals are fully acclimatised, overheating, distress and suffering is 
likely when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Celsius for more than a 
few minutes.

'The 
temperature in a car in full sun on a hot day can rise to double that 
outside of the vehicle in a short time, leading rapidly to distress for 
any animal in the vehicle.'

'Cross
 channel ferries refuse to allow owners to have their pets with them, no
 matter what the weather, and we believe that this is an animal welfare 
issue.

'It would be an 
animal rights abuse for a person to leave their pet in their car on land
 for over an hour, so how can the ferry companies be allowed to make pet
 owners do this?

'The companies charge pet owners a premium for taking their pets already.'

After the incident, Ms Wallace, 31, from Alnwick, Northumberland, took to social networking site Facebook to describe her black pug dog as her 'angel' and said she simply 'couldn’t believe' he had died.

Her sister, Jade Allan, 24, also from Alnwick, wrote on the petition: 'This is my sister’s dog, and I can’t tell you how upset the whole family are.

'They are moving over from Germany. When they go back home to pack he is going to be a massive miss he was her baby along with her other pets get this spread and known about.'

Warnings are regularly issued about leaving dogs in cars for even a short period of time.

They recommend leaving windows open if dogs are left in cars to increase ventilation.

Natalie
 Hardy, a spokesman for P&O Ferries said the company followed the 
correct procedures but a spokesman not available for comment to specify the 
procedures.

She said: 'A passenger was travelling to the UK with three dogs.

P&O Ferries, which runs the Spirit of France boat on which the dog was travelling, said it followed the correct procedures in transporting Merlin

'The pets were declared, the car was parked accordingly and in the appropriate place on the car deck with the windows open for ventilation and the ship’s ventilation was correctly set.

'However, upon arrival in Dover one of the three dogs had died and could not be revived despite CPR and oxygen.

'This incident was obviously very distressing for the family and the staff who helped try to revive the pet, which was taken away by Animal Welfare.'
