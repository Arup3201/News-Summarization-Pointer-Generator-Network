When it comes to subscription delivery services, humans are spoiled for choice.

We order magazines from Conde Nast, movies on LoveFilm, food via Abel & Cole, make-up with Birchbox, snacks on Graze, gifts from Happy Box and - although we know that we really, really shouldn't - everything else on Amazon.

Surely it's only fair that our four-legged friends get a little letterbox-drop of their own? Enter Pooch Pack, the monthly gift subscription service for the pampered pet who has everything... or, rather, who will have everything - come next month.

Showered with puppy love: The service sends a fresh box of fun to your dog every month

Delicious...for dogs: The November box included sweet potato and papaya chews, treats from the doggie patisserie and probiotic drinks

Boxes of treats, toys, chews and grooming products for your furry pal are packaged into a box and delivered to your door, and previous goodie hampers have included such delights as sweet potato chews, probiotic drinks, oatmeal shampoo, vanilla-scented toys, breath mints, 100 per cent natural rubber chews and a hi-tech water bottle that releases water only when your dog licks it.

Other surprises include tug-o-war chew toys, Cornish pasty treats and a keyring to hold doggy bags.

Each box contains between four and six treats, and monthly subscription rates start at £16.95.

But the gift service is not all about your happy, beloved, family dogs. A portion of the profits go to canine charities, too.

A spokesman said: 'We are not only passionate about making dogs happy but we are also passionate about helping stray and abandoned dogs.

'With thousands of dogs in rescue centres around the UK, every little bit helps. That is why we will donate a portion of our profits to organisations throughout the country.'

Christmas comes early: In May's box there are more vegan sweet potato chews, a furry hedgehog toy, a tug-o-war chew and some Barkers Brew, a non-alcoholic beverage full of vitamins for pouring into food

Taesha Glasgow, founder of Pooch Pack, said: 'I was inspired by the beauty subscription boxes on the market and my love of dogs.

'I wanted to start a business which would be fun for the dog, their owners and me! I love seeing the pictures and videos of our customers enjoying their boxes.

'In the future, we are hoping to customise the boxes for the chewing habit of the dog and their age (We have a Puppy Pooch Pack on its way in the next few weeks).

'We would also like a presence in Germany and other parts of Europe because we do have quite a few customers there already and believe there is a demand.'

The perfect package: June subscribers were treated to Bailey breath-freshening bites, a hi-tech water bottle, and delicious liver treats

Homegrown goodies: Cornish pasty treats, salmon nibbles and 100 per cent natural hoop toys in the July box
