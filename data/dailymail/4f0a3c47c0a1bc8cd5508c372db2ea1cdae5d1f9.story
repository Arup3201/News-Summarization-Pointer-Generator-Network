Little Nupela may only be ten-months-old, but the cheeky Goodfellow's Tree Kangaroo has proved she's full of confidence and ready to take on the world.

The adorable joey is the first of her species to be born in Sydney's Taronga Zoo for over 20 years according to her keepers.

Although she was born in September last year, the little marsupial only just began to peek out of her mother's pouch in March.

Nupela, born in September of 2013, is the first tree Kangaroo to be born at Taronga Zoo in Sydney in 20 years

The cheeky joey is currently 10-months-old and at only 2.6 kilograms, is only a quarter of the size of a full grown adult tree kangaroo

Now, the little critter happily bounds around alongside Qwikila, her proud mother, with her adventurous personality delighting the zoo's visitors.

'She started coming out of her mum's pouch probably about 10 weeks ago and she kind of stopped fitting in the pouch about six weeks ago,' Nupela's keeper Sam Bennet said.

'There was about a month where she was going in and out as she built up her muscles so that she could climb tress properly.'

Currently, Nupela is only a quarter of the size of a regular adult, weighing 2.6 kilograms and growing rapidly.

Nupela's keeper, Sam Bennet, says her personality has flourished since she left her mother's pouch and that she is often spotted playing with her mum

Her mother, Qwikila (right) arrived from Belfast Zoo in Northern Ireland in January last year before she successfully mated with the zoo's resident male, Parum

Nupela is incredibly enthusiastic during feeding time, according to her keeper, who said she is growing rapidly

'Shes certainly become a confident little tree kangaroo – we've caught her playing with her mum and chasing her around the yard, which was quite funny to watch,' Mr Bennet said.

'She's also incredibly motivated for food and constantly wants to eat, which explains her growing so quickly.'

Her mother, Qwikila, arrived from Belfast Zoo in Northern Ireland in January last year and staff were thrilled when she successfully mated with the zoo's resident male, Parum shortly afterwards.

Keepers are now attempting to encourage Parum and their fourth roo, Salsa, to also mate by keeping them in a separate enclosure to the new mum and her baby.

Nupela is Taronga Zoo's fourth resident tree kangaroo. The zoo is part of an international breeding program attempting to increase the species' population number

The number of tree Kangaroos in captivity is currently a tiny 50 in captivity and the marsupials are listed as an endangered species

Goodfellow’s Tree Kangaroos are native to Papua New Guinea, where they are endangered.

Taronga Zoo is one of many zoos around the world which are part of an international breeding program attempting to increase the species' population number, which has dropped to a tiny 50 in captivity.

They are normally a deep brown colour with golden yellow limbs and a long, mottled yellow and brown tail.

Living in trees and feeding on leaves and fruit, they are known to hop from branch to branch and can comfortably land on the ground from a 10 metre drop.
