Police are being called out thousands of times a year to deal with dementia patients, an investigation has found.

One chief constable said his officers had become an ‘extension of social services’ as a result of the crisis in dementia care.

Most incidents involved patients who had gone missing but call-outs also included incidents where care home or hospital staff had become unable to cope.

Sussex Police attended 1,800 incidents last year concerning vulnerable patients in hospitals and care homes or when they went missing. Of these, 71 involved violence.

Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, described his force as becoming an ‘outpost of the NHS’ and an ‘extension of social services’.

He added that because dementia sufferers are vulnerable patients, his officers are duty-bound to prioritise their cases and stay with them for ‘hours’ in hospitals.

‘We have seen a number of incidents where we feel our officers are called inappropriately to care homes and the wards of hospitals to try and restrain patients,’ he said.

‘We have made it really clear that should only happen in the most extreme of circumstances.’

Sir Peter suggested introducing a national database of carers and the families of elderly vulnerable people so that officers could phone a carer in an emergency.

The extent of police involvement with dementia patients was revealed in a Freedom of Information request by BBC Radio 5 Live, to which only 14 of the country’s 46 forces responded.

Sir Peter also spoke on the use of handcuffs for dementia patients, saying it was ‘a difficult judgment’ for officers.

‘Sometimes people suffering with dementia can be violent and can be in danger of harming others and also injuring themselves,’ he said.

‘It might be something that has to be done as a very, very short-term measure before medical intervention.’

Recent figures have shown that the number of dementia patients being sedated, tied to chairs or locked in bedrooms by staff in hospitals and care homes has doubled in the past three years.

Some 2,979 restraint orders were granted for such patients last year, up from 1,459 in 2009/10.

The measures are officially referred to as Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards and are sometimes necessary to prevent confused patients wandering off or harming themselves.

But as they breach patients’ human rights, staff must apply to either their NHS trust or care home before resorting to them.

Figures from the Information Centre for Health and Social Care show that 6,355 applications were made by hospital staff and carers to restrain dementia patients in 2012/13, but just under half – 2,979 – were approved.

But these do not include the number of times staff restrained patients without seeking permission.George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said society is ‘not equipped’ to support people with dementia.

‘We need a step change to enable people with dementia to live in our communities,’ he said.
