The recreation of one of the most famous moments from the First World War by Sainsbury's helped the supermarket's 2014 Christmas advert be named the most viewed in the UK. 

Britain's third biggest supermarket beat John Lewis's Monty the penguin, with its 'creative interpretation' of Christmas Day 1914 when British and German soldiers laid down their weapons and met in no man's land. 

The supermarket chain reconstructed the trenches scene to celebrate their 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign.

 But the advert was marred with some controversy, while some called it moving and brilliant others branded it an 'exploitive way for big business to advertise itself. 

The Sainsbury's commercial had 16.6 million views globally on YouTube by the end of 2014 and John Lewis had 22.1 million, the Guardian reported. 

However, the video sharing website ranked Sainsbury's Christmas the most views in the UK, but did not give the figures to support this.

The John Lewis advert, featuring Monty the Penguin, was the second most watched commercial in the UK, despite having the most global views

The supermarket's winning ad followed a British soldier as he hears enemy troops singing Silent Night in German and ventures into 'no man's land' before soldiers from both sides join him and shake hands.

He shares a moment of friendship with a young German soldier and, as the truce ends and they return to their trenches, the German is moved to discover that his British friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket - linked the supermarket's message of 'sharing' at Christmas. 

John Lewis this year concentrated on the heart-warming friendship between a little boy and a penguin.

Taking the number three and four spots were adverts by sportswear company Nike, featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney.

Marks and Spencer Christmas offering came in at the number seven spot, with just 3.2million views.

Two playful fairies, named Magic and Sparkle, were the stars of the retailer's advertising campaign.

A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: ‘We’ve been delighted with the overwhelmingly positive response we’ve had from customers and colleagues to our portrayal of the 1914 Christmas Day Truce, and that it has been so popular on YouTube.

'As you probably know, we partnered with The Royal British Legion, in the 20th year of our relationship with them, to ensure we told the story with authenticity and respect and to help raise awareness and additional funds for the important work they do.

'In fact, by selling the million bars we made, we will be able to donate £500k to the Legion.’

Marks and Spencer's Christmas advert, featuring two fairies, was ranked seventh
