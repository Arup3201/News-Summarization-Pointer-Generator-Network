Manny Pacquiao's preparations for his $300million (£200m) fight with Floyd Mayweather continue to push him to the limit as he was put through a gruelling 20-minute abs workout.

Pacquiao was joined by fans for the session, before going five hard rounds against two different partners on his first day of sparring ahead of the mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2.

'When Manny threw out the first punch it felt like opening day of Irish Spring Training,' joked trainer Freddie Roach. 'Manny looked so fresh today. I'm very happy with what he showed me.

'You couldn't tell he had been away from the ring since the [Chris] Algieri fight in November. Manny is on fire in the gym. I am confident May 2 will be celebrated for years to come at St. Manny's Day - the day he drove Mayweather out of boxing.'

Mayweather has been going back to basics, chopping wood 'Rocky style' as the pound-for-pound king emulated past greats such as Muhammad Ali.

Pacquiao was approached unannounced by an anti-doping examiner at the house he is renting in Los Angeles just days ago, and admitted he was glad his first day of sparring had finally arrived. 

'After 13 days of strength and conditioning and boxing drills at Wild Card, plus weeks more of working out in the Philippines in February, it was great to finally put on the headgear and spar,' he said.

'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.'
