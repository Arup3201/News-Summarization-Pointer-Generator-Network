Former Federal prosecutor Robert Fiske said he was set to indict several  Arkansas politicians and businessmen before he was removed from the case

The original federal prosecutor assigned to investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement in the so-called Whitewater scandal has told how he was set to indict several high-level Arkansas politicians and businessmen before being removed from the case.

Former U.S. Attorney Robert Fiske claims he uncovered 'serious crimes' while investigating the affair in the early 1990s and was left angry and frustrated when  a panel of federal judges replaced him on the grounds  he was not independent enough.

And in a forthcoming memoir Mr Fiske tells how his team viewed David Hale - the man who famously accused Bill Clinton of pressuring him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan - as a 'credible witness'.

Mr Fiske said that by the summer of 1994, he was preparing to bring eight indictments against 11 defendants.

These included criminal charges for fraud against the Clintons' Whitewater business partners Jim and Susan McDougal, Hillary Clinton's former law partner and associate attorney general Webster Hubbell and Bill Clinton's successor as governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker.

Mr Fiske claims his removal as prosecutor was a major blow to the investigation and caused the probe to drag on far longer than it should have.

His replacement Kenneth Starr was a former federal appellate judge who had no prosecutorial experience.

Mr Fiske told Yahoo News: 'The simplest way to put it, after I was replaced, the lawyers on the staff in Arkansas said the agents for the FBI and IRS were totally demoralized.

'They thought we were on the brink of doing all these great things, and now that was not going to happen.' 

Bill and Hillary Clinton pictured in 19992. The affair dogged the couple throughout Mr Clinton's years as president. He has always strenuously denied any wrong doing

The scandal which dogged Bill Clinton throughout his years as President began when a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a business owned by the Clinton's business partners Jim and Susan McDougal. 

Claims: Former municipal judge David Hale accused Mr Clinton of pressuring him to make an illegal $300,000 loan

Although the Little Rock U.S. Attorney  and the FBI believed  the referral lacked merit, the investigator, L. Jean Lewis, issued several additional referrals against the Clintons.

After these became public knowledge, she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1994.

But the most incendiary allegations against the Clintons came from David Hale, the owner of a federally subsidized small-business lending company and a former municipal judge.

Hale claimed that Clinton had pressured him to make an illegal $300,000 federally-backed loan to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. 

He claimed the money was to be used to pay off the Clintons and the McDougal's debts following the failed Whitewater real estate project.

According to Hale, Clinton told him: 'My name can't show up on this'.

The Clintons have always streneously denied the allegations, deriding the entire affair as little more than a politically-motivated smear campaign.

Their supporters point to the fact that Hale failed to mention the Clintons during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989.

Three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence to link the Clintons to any crimes.

However the McDougals were convicted following a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

Susan McDougal served 18 months in prison after being held in contempt of court after refusing to answer any questions relating to Whitewater. She was granted a pardon by President Clinton just before leaving office.

Bill Clinton's successor as Arkansas Governor, Jim Guy Tucker, also served time in prison after his role in the fraud was revealed.

The Whitewater affair is likely to return to haunt Hillary Clinton if she runs for President

In his book Mr Fiske tells how Hale's information helped the investigation and that his team had vetted Hale's story.

He added: 'Standing alone, nobody was going to bring a case based on what he was telling us.

'But from what we had seen of him, we thought the story was plausible and was certainly worth pursuing.'

Curiously Mr Fiske was hauled off the case because he had been appointed by Clinton's attorney general - which the conservative federal judges claime meant he was not independent enough.

While little new has emerged surrounding the case in recent years it looks set to come back to haunt Hillary Clinton if she runs for president.
