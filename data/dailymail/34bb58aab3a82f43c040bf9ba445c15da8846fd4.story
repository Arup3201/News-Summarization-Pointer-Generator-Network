Six starving dogs were rescued from a home in Pinal County, Arizona on April 1 after Animal Care officers received a tip that there were severely underweight animals at that location.

When officers arrived at the property in the Hidden Valley area, they were shocked to find a nearly dead pit bull mix lying on her side and covered in flies.

All six of the dogs were without food, water, or shade but that pit bull was in such bad shape she had to be immediately transported to a veterinarian for treatment. It was later discovered that the pit bull only weighed a meager 25 pounds.

The owner claimed to feed his dogs on a daily basis but the starving appearance lead officers to think otherwise

The next morning Animal Care officers contacted the owner and found that the dogs' 'caretaker' did have food available to feed his animals, reports AZ Central.

He claimed to feed his dogs on a daily basis but officers had a difficult time believing that due to the haggard appearance of all of the pets.

'This was a sickening find for our officers,' said Animal Care and Control Director Kaye Dickson. All the dogs were found in deplorable conditions, no food, shade or even water. You can easily tell the owner did not care for these animals.'

The findings from the investigation will be submitted to the county attorney's office for consideration of possible prosecution. The owner could be charged with animal cruelty and neglect.

Pinal County animal care officials are still trying to decide whether or not the dogs should be put up for adoption.
