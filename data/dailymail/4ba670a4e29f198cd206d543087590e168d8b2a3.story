Severe weather, protesters and gaffe-filled speeches are always a worry at political conventions, but unfavorable hotel reviews hint that bed bugs may also be an issue for the Democratic delegates this year.

According to a bed bug complaint website, nine of the hotels being used by convention delegations have had bed bug sightings in recent months.

Even though county health officials said that they inspected all of the hotels in question in July, some of the complaints from angry visitors allege that the problems may not have been fully exterminated.

Pesty past: The Charlotte Marriott City Center had the highest number of complaints on a bed bug message board site but their spokesman said that they maintain strict cleaning schedules

Nice exterior: The Holiday Inn Center City, which is hosting the Illinois delegation, had previous complaints about the insects but they deny that it is a problem

The Bedbug Registry, an online message board where hotel guests can write reviews of their various visits, shows that of the 21 hotels in Charlotte that have had complaints, nine of those were assigned to various delegations including the ones from Minnesota, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

Florida delegates may be in the most trouble, however, as their Charlotte Marriot City Center location had the highest number of complaints on the website.

Of the hotel's six complaints, the most recent was logged at the beginning of August, one month after the county officials said they checked for bedbugs.

The hotel denied these allegations, telling The Washington Times that they maintain 'strict cleanliness standards, which includes constant monitoring and routine assessments of guest rooms and public space.'

Another hotel that was given a poor pest review was the Holiday Inn Center City, which received three complaints and has received representatives from the Illinois delegation for the past few days leading up to tonight's kick off.

While a hotel representative declined to give MailOnline a statement, she denied that they have bedbugs and said that the web claims alleging otherwise were wrong.

Bed bugs aren't the only problem plaguing the traveling delegates, as seven of the rooms reserved for California representatives were deemed unsafe after a large portion of stucco from the Blake Hotel  fell off on Friday.

Local station WSOCTV reported that nine stories of stucco fell from the side of the uptown building and required quick construction to be fixed in time.

The Sacramento Bee said that state senator Ted Lieu tweeted his complaints about how he had to switch rooms five times in the first two days he was in the hotel because of broken locks, a 'funny smell' and- in keeping with the insect theme- cockroaches.

Adding to the list of complaints that is sure to grow and the convention continues, delegates from Texas, Maryland and Tennessee all woke up on the wrong side of the morning when the fire alarm at the Great Wolf Lodge went off at 3am on Tuesday, prompting an evacuation.

Once it was determined that it was a false alarm, some of the upset early risers jokingly tweeted that it might have been a Republican prank.
