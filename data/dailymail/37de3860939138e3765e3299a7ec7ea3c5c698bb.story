Looking shyly into the camera, nothing in Deng Wen Ge’s high school volleyball team photograph suggests that she was destined for bigger things.

In this exclusive photograph from 1980, she was certainly taller than many of her classmates at 5ft 11 inches, but both her name – Chinese for ‘Cultural Revolution’ – and her conservative hairstyle fitted right in with her Communist peers in the factory city of Xuzhou.

Few among her wealthy, well-connected society friends in the United States would recognize the teenage athlete, as Wendi Deng, who until last summer was the wife of Rupert Murdoch, the world’s most powerful and controversial media mogul.

Work: Ms Deng was said to have had 'some cosmetic surgery work' when she moved to America with the main ambition of becoming 'rich and famous'

Through sheer force of will and the patronage of certain well-placed friends, Wendi, the name she adopted in her teens, went from the poor daughter of a $50-a-month factory manager living in a town where the lights went out every night at 7pm to a multi-millionaire divorcee in a $60million triplex on Fifth Avenue in the city that never sleeps.

The first step in her remarkable journey began with her arrival in California in February 1988 after meeting a 50-year-old American engineer working on a project in Xuzhou, who agreed to help improve her English.

With the enthusiastic co-operation of his wife, Jake Cherry sponsored Wendi’s student visa and put her up at their La Cresenta, California, home sharing a bedroom with their five-year-old daughter.

Suddenly, from sharing clothes with friends in Xuzhou and donning her lookalike high school volleyball team uniform, Wendi was wearing pairs of $200 jeans, her California State University, Northridge, economics professor Daniel Blake told Vanity Fair.

In a 2007 interview by writer Eric Ellis for Australia’s ‘The Monthly’ magazine, Blake also described Wendi as 'a trendy dresser, a modern girl'.

According to another of her professors, Kenneth Chapman, Wendi, one of his brightest students, had ‘some kind of cosmetic surgery’ and turned up wearing dark glasses at around that time when she was living in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s.

‘I don’t remember a whole lot,’ Chapman said this week. ‘We are going back to the 1990s. ‘When she graduated there was a picture of her taken when she had a lunch with a couple of friends.’

‘Can you imagine what it would've been like, how she got there with no knowledge of the culture?’ a New York friend of Wendi’s told Ellis.

‘It was almost inevitable that she was going to make some mistakes. I don't think she has an evil personality; she just has this incredible ambition coupled with this lack of self-consciousness. She got to California and she wanted to social-climb, to get out of the situation that got her there.’

By this time, the Cherry’s marriage had become a casualty of Wendi’s move to the West.

According to a numerous reports, Jake Cherry - who is now 76 - was kicked out of the family home by his wife, Joyce, after she discovered he was having an affair with his young protégé.

younger man, David Wolf, who was closer to her own age.

The Wall Street Journal later reported the divorce became official after two years and seven months in 1992, which is seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a 'green card'.

From there, Deng’s social ascent became all the more rapid.

She enrolled in an MBA course at the prestigious Yale School of management in 1995 and as part of her internship requirement she won a temporary job at Star TV, a satellite television station in Hong Kong that was owned by Murdoch’s NewsCorp.

The internship may have taken her back to Communist China, but it was also the direct route to the heart of one of the titans of capitalism.

Simply put, according to her old Star TV colleagues, Deng’s ‘ambition was to be rich and famous.’

It wasn’t long before an opportunity came her way to meet Murdoch when she was reportedly asked to accompany him as an interpreter and guide on a trip to Shanghai.

The May-December working relationship developed into a romance, rocking the Murdoch family.

Murdoch and Wendi were married in 1999, just 17 days after his divorce from ex-wife Anna.

The union would bring the couple two children and all the fame Wendi could have ever dreamed of. She met the Queen of England and hobnobbed with tycoons and movie stars.

Her photograph was a staple of the society columns and, if a recent Vanity Fair article is to believed, she was impressed by other powerful men like Google chairman Eric Schmidt.

According to a note to herself written by Wendi that was published in Vanity Fair, she was more than happy with the way her transformation from Chinese factory town girl to Manhattan society maven has worked out.

Break up: Ms Deng divorced Mr Murdoch last year after having two of his children. Her notes that were revealed in Vanity Fair revealed that she thought she had 'style, grace' that she 'looked gorgeous and so young, so cool'

‘Lisa [girlfriend of Eric Schmidt, left] will never have my style, grace,’ she wrote. ‘I achieved my purpose of Eric saw me looking so gorgeous and so fantastic and so young, so cool, so chic, so stylish, so funny and he cannot have me.’

The article also revealed details of a lovestruck note from Ms Deng, in which she praised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s ‘good body’, his ‘really, really good legs’ and even his ‘butt’.

It said staff at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, were uneasy when Mr Blair arrived and tried to find her.

The magazine claimed they told him Ms Deng had gone to the master bedroom, but ‘by the time they could tell her, Mr Blair was looking for her, they found Mr Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him’.

On another occasion ‘they were feeding each other during dinner, which made the staff uncomfortable’, the magazine claimed.

Mr Blair’s friends deny he had an affair, they were feeding each other and that he was ever alone with Ms Deng. Vanity Fair says Mr Blair had 'rolled his eyes' and looked 'panicked' when he was told Mr Murdoch would not be joining them until the following night.

Just a week after the Vanity Fair story broke, Wendi, now 45, was back in the limelight hosting a diamond promotional night in New York.

Wearing a glamorous lace black and cerise gown she could afford to smile for the camera. She’d come a very long way from that posed team photo with her high school sports team.
