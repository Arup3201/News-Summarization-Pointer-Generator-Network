Thibaut Courtois' performances with Atletico Madrid have earned him a return to parent club Chelsea, and the Spanish side have wasted no time in signing up a new keeper.

The La Liga champions unveiled Solvenian stopper Jan Oblak on Tuesday, a £12.6million signing from Portuguese side Benfica.

And the 21-year-old was quick to insist he is the man to take over from his Stamford Bridge-bound predecessor.

Done deal: Jan Oblak will line up for Atletico Madrid in La Liga next season

Confident: Oblak is hoping to make a big impression at Atletico after his £12.6m move

Talented: The 21-year-old was  highly-rated in Portugal during his time there

He said: 'I’m aware that I’ve come here to replace Courtois. I’m here with other goalkeepers, and I hope to get good results. I’ll give my best.

'I’m happy with the chance to play in La Liga. It’s better than the Portuguese league and it’s a huge challenge for me. I’ll give my all to be up to the mark.

'I want to thank the president. My first impressions have been good. I’m very happy. I’m getting to know everyone at the club and my first impressions are incredible.

'I chose Atlético because I know that it’s the right club. I spoke to the directors and I loved what they said to me. I’m happy with the decision I’ve made.'
