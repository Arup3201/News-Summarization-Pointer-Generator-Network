Trapped eight-feet underground for six days days without food or water, Brillo the dog probably thought his time was up.

But thanks to his determined yapping, and his owner's sharp ears, he was given a second chance.

Brillo the wirehead dachshund escaped from his garden and got trapped down a badger sett in nearby woodland.

Owner Andrew Hynard, 53, thought he’d never see him again until he was walking his other dog Mocha and heard noises under his feet.

He recognised Brillo’s bark and tried to dig down through the soil to save the 12-year-old pooch.

After an hour of desperately trying to get to his pet, Mr Hynard realised Brillo was too far down.

He called Kent Fire and Rescue and after three hours of digging the dog was found - eight-foot underground.

Relieved surveyor My Hynard said: 'He just disappeared from the garden.

Mischievous mutt: Owners Debbie Hynard and daughter Lucy are happy Brillo survived the ordeal

'We had friends and family searching for him all last week, to no avail. He had disappeared before but always came back.

'After about two or three hours of digging, the firemen pulled him out.

'But not after he had given them a couple of nips, the ungrateful so-and-so.'

Naughty Brillo has previously disappeared from his home in Tenterden, Kent, for days on end.

He once had to be dug out of a badger sett by Mr Hynard and needed his chest stitched up after a spat with a badger.

His latest antic saw him go missing on October 21 after getting excited around some badger setts

A four-person team from Kent Fire and Rescue Service rescued the pup on Sunday.

Lucky Brillo has now fully recovered from his escapade and is back to his normal self.
