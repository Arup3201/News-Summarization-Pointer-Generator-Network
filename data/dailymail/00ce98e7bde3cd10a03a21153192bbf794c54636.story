Gable Tostee was covered in scratches on his face and all over his body after having drunk and rough sex with New Zealand woman Warriena Wright on the night she died, court documents say.

Documents tendered to the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday state Tostee had marks on his face, neck, back, leg and hand when he was examined by forensic medical officer Dr Nelle van Buuren, the Courier Mail reported.

This comes as a judge has said the charge of murder against Gold Coast man Gable Tostee is 'weak' and 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony when Warriena Wright plunged to her death from his Surfers Paradise apartment last month.

New Zealand citizen Warriena Tagpuno Wright was on a two week holiday in Australia when she plunged 14 storeys to her death, after organising to meet with Gold Coast man Gable Tostee through dating app 'Tinder'

Police documents allege that an audio recording from Tostee's phone reveal the sounds of a struggle, during which someone is choked and taunted.

Tostee has been charged with Ms Wright's murder. Police documents have been filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Tostee's bail application on Monday

Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'.

'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said.

Police will allege Tostee and Ms Wright had violent sex, and afterward a scuffle took place inside his Gold Coast apartment before the 28-year-old forced Ms Wright onto his balcony and locked her out. Ms Wright then fell to her death.

Tostee allegedly recorded over three hours of audio during the time he spent with Ms Wright, who he met via the dating app Tinder, on August 7 and in the early hours of August 8.

Court documents also state that neighbours living in the apartments one and two floors below Tostee told police they heard 'thudding and scuffling' and loud bangs like furniture was being dropped on the floor on the night Ms Wright died.

Gabriele Collyer-Wiedner, who lives on the floor under Tostee, said she woke up at 2am to the loud noises, the Courier Mail reported.

'A short time after that I heard a female person shout the words "no, no, no",' she said.

Emergency crews at the scene of Ms Wright's death at the foot of the highrise Avalon apartments in Surfer's Paradise in Queensland, where Tostee resided.

Ms Collyer-Wiedner told police she went out onto her balcony where she saw two legs dangling from above.

'The person did not say anything and neither did I,' she said. 'In a matter of seconds I saw the person fall from the balcony above mine... I screamed when the person was falling and I think that the person screamed as well.'

Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder.

In court on Monday, Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins: 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult

'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis.

She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents.

Tostee's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives. The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15.

Police have opposed bail for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright.

Police say Tostee would immediately go back on Tinder if released and contact young women and, given his 'propensity of violence' would pose an 'unacceptable risk' to the community.

A document filed in the bail application in the  says an examination of Tostee's mobile phone 'has identified that he has been in contact with over 250 female persons using the Tinder application since March 2014'.

'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media,' a document filed in the court said.

'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'

Documents filed to the Supreme Court claim the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman 'you're lucky I haven't thrown you off the balcony' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death.

Ms Wright was a 26-year-old, visiting Australia for a two week trip to attend the wedding of friends

Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge, after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright's death on August 8.

Documents, filed in the Supreme Court on Monday, allege a recording on Mr Tostee's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died.

The documents claim the recording started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', Brisbane Times reported.

Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'.

The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13am, and the male tells the woman 'That is enough. You have worn out your welcome. You have to leave.'

The female, who sounds out of breath, says 'OK'.

A male voice allegedly says: 'I thought you were kidding and i have taken enough. This is f***ing b***s***, you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn psycho little b****'.

The male then tells her he is going to walk her out of his apartment without her belongings. She says 'I am so sorry' to which he replies 'I don't care'.

There are sounds of a struggle and the male says 'Let it go' repeatedly before a metallic object is dropped.

A door can be heard opening and the woman tells the male, 'no, no, no'.

The male then says: 'You tried to kill me huh? Well why did you try and hit me with that huh? Shut your filthy mouth.'

The woman then says 'No, no, no, no, no' repeatedly and a door is heard slamming shut.

The female then says 'Just let me go home' before faint screaming is allegedly heard.

A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer and to Tostee's father.

Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building.

It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright's death.

Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30am.

Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, before returning to Tostee's apartment.

Ms Wright lived in New Zealand's Lower Hutt region and was in Australia for a two-week holiday to attend a wedding. 

Tostee maintains his innocence and says he will fight the charge.
