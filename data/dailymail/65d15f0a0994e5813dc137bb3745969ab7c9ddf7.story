The Paris haute couture shows are the stuff of fashion dreams.

The garments, some of which require 3,000 hours of work, are crafted with the red carpet in mind and are so bespoke that they don't even come with a price tag because if you're lucky enough to snap one up, budget is of no relevance.

One of the most hotly-anticipated designers to showcase in the French capital tonight was Valentino.

The label, which is coveted by the A-list, served up romantic skirts, dresses and coats printed with poetic embellishment.

The brand's creative directors, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, were inspired by 'love in its purest form' and SS15  was a story of billowing velvet dresses and hand-embroidered sheepskin coats.

The brand's creative directors were inspired by 'love in its purest form' and the work of Marc Chagall

The main source of inspiration came from the work of Marc Chagall, the Russian-French artist

The duo's main source of inspiration came from the work of Marc Chagall, the Russian-French artist who travelled between St Petersburg and Paris before World War One. 

The SS15 pieces took cue from Chagall’s romantic and modernist interpretation of different cultures. 

There was plenty of white tulle hand-painted in grey and embroidered with pearls and delicate flowers. 

One dress, which was splashed with the moon and smatterings of stars, took a staggering 3,000 hours to embroider on hand painted linen. 

Velvet was on the runway in abundance - and an Angelina Jolie inspired gown slashed at the thigh got the Twittersphere excited

The pieces were described as 'pure, burning, angelic and exhilarating' by the creative directors
