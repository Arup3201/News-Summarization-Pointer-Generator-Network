Leicester have opened talks with Marseille over defender Rod Fanni and are closing on former Real Madrid midfielder Esteban Cambiasso.

France international Fanni could be allowed to leave on a free transfer and is training with Leicester to establish his fitness.

The 32-year-old has been linked with moves to England for the past four years and Leicester want an experienced defender to cover for Matt Upson's injury.

Pearson is also still looking to strike agreement with free agent midfielder Esteban Cambiasso.

Cambiasso, who turned 34 on Monday, also has interest from Sevilla.
