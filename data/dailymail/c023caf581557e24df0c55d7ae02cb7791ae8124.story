A British walker was stunned after she came across this strange exotic fungus which appeared to have six red tentacles. 

Lucy Purdy was enjoying a stroll through the countryside of Dartmoor in Devon when she was hit by the smell of rotting flesh.

Intrigued she found the creature which bears a close resemblance to an octopus, with red 'tentacles' emerging from a pod lying on the ground.

Walker Lucy Purdy was stunned when she discovered the Clathus Archeri fungus (pictured) more commonly known as 'devils fingers' or 'octopus stinkhorn', growing in Dartmoor, Devon

She took a quick snap of the putrid pod and sent it into the workers at Devon Wildlife Trust, who identified it as Clathrus Archeri.

Clathus Archeri, more commonly known as 'devils fingers' or 'octopus stinkhorn', is identifiable by its long red tentacles, and foul smell which it uses to attract flies.

The exotic fungus is native to Australia and New Zealand was first discovered in the UK a century ago - and only occasionally found here.

The exotic fungus is native to Australia and New Zealand was first discovered in the UK a century ago - and only occasionally found here 

It is believed the species travelled to the UK inside crates of military weapons shipped to the South West from the Antipodes early in the First World War.

The creepy-looking growth is formed when four to seven tentacles erupt from a suberumpent egg, and slowly grow as the fungus matures.

Initially the tentacles are white, and the fungus strongly resembles a disembodied human hand.

After a while the tentacles open up and develop their adult colour of pinkish-red.

The devils fingers are not poisonous, and are technically edible, although due to their foul taste and smell it is recommended they are only eaten in wilderness survival circumstances.
