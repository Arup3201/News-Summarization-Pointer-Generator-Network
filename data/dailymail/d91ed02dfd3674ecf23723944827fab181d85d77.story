Younger
fans of Kate Spade’s playful yet chic take on Hamptons prep are in for a treat
come spring when the brand launches new line, Kate Spade Saturday, targeting
the 25-35-year-old market.

The
new ‘vertical’ brand will stand alone from its older sibling Kate Spade New York
but borrow much of its style from its vibrant, bold looks with acids and
stripes peppered throughout the collection.

A
line of shoes, accessories and household goods will compliment a complete range
of apparel – including dresses, shorts and tops, jeans and jackets.

CEO
of Kate Spade LLC, Craig Leavitt told WWD: ‘It’s meant to capture the spirit of
Saturday every day of the week.’

He
went on to insist though that ‘it is not a diffusion line’ and that it will
only be available on the brand’s website Saturday.com and in its own stores.

Designed
with a younger customer in mind, the line will address the budget concerns of
the age group too, offering products at half the price of Kate Spade New York.

The
average price point for Kate Spade Saturday categories will run at $90 for
clothing; $25 for home; $85 for shoes.

Kate
Spade’s signature colour blocking and strong patterns will reappear in prints
for both apparel as well as handbags and totes that will retail for around
$130.

As well as offering Kate Spade fans style, the brand is also designed to address the budget concerns of its target age brand too, retailing at half the price of Kate Spade New York products

Carryall
bags have been designed for the consummate weekender with pockets for wine
bottles and a zip compartment for dirty laundry and shoes.

While
the shoe line is said to encapsulate a casual, laid-back style, customers to
the Kate Spade Saturday stores will eventually be able to smarten up their
totes at customisation stations offering a choice of colour, webbing and
monogram.

Watches
will average $50 while eyewear, swimwear and fashion accessories will set the
clientele back about the same amount and jewellery items will sell for around
$30.

And
for those seeking the full Kate Spade Saturday look both on the street and at
home, pillows, mugs and small furniture will also be available.

Mr
Leavitt said of the new brand and its youthful style: ‘This is really global. I
think this girl exists all over the world.

‘There’s
a lot more commonality [with these younger customers] because of social media
and the way they interact with each other.’

Kate
Spade Saturday will launch on ecommerce in Tokyo and Brazil and feature
American-style cafes in its flagship stores to celebrate its provenance.
