Police who investigated a rape complaint from a young woman who killed herself after being put on trial accused of making up the ordeal have maintained she should never have been prosecuted.

Eleanor de Freitas, 23, a brilliant but vulnerable A-grade student, was charged with perverting the course of justice after the man who allegedly attacked her spent up to £200,000 on bringing a private prosecution.

Detectives believed Miss de Freitas, who suffered from a psychiatric illness, had told the truth about the rape when she reported it, but they decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction.

The Crown Prosecution Service, however, accused her of making up the rape. 

Her family said she was so terrified of giving evidence that she took her own life on April 7 this year, three days before her trial was to start at Southwark Crown Court in London.

Police investigators said Miss de Freitas, who had bipolar disorder, should never have been charged.

But they were overruled by Martin Hewitt, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, after lawyers from the CPS held a meeting with him.

Detective Inspector Julian King, of Sapphire, the Met’s sexual offences investigation unit, said in a letter this month: ‘I stand by my decision in that I do not believe that Eleanor should ever have been prosecuted for PCJ [perverting the course of justice].’

Police received an allegation of rape from Miss de Freitas (left) in January last year but the case was dropped after Alexander Economou (right), the son of a shipping tycoon, was arrested and released due to a lack of sufficient evidence

The letter emerged yesterday after the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, who reviewed the case, vigorously defended the decision to take Miss de Freitas to court.

Mrs Saunders, who described it as ‘one of the most complex’ cases she had seen, said: ‘The evidence was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice.

‘This was evidence including text messages and CCTV footage that directly contradicted the account Ms de Freitas gave to the police. I am satisfied that the decision-making in this case was correct.’

Miss de Freitas, a former Durham University student, told detectives that Alexander Economou, 35, raped her just before Christmas 2012.

Following a police investigation, wealthy financier Mr Economou, from Chelsea, was told he would not face charges, but he then paid for his own inquiry in an attempt to show he was innocent. 

He assembled emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas sharing kisses. 

He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police.

Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year.

Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges.

But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year.

The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it. To the horror of Miss de Freitas and her family, it decided to continue.

Miss de Freitas killed herself on April 7, three days before she was due to stand trial.

The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out.

Mr Economou says police refused to look at video and text messages that he believes would have exonerated him – a claim the student’s family deny.

He had also revealed that he had found photographs of scantily-clad Miss de Freitas on websites where she called herself ‘Goddess Olivia’ and had a secret life offering ‘tantric’ sensual massages to paying customers.

Miss de Freitas’s father, David, from Fulham, West London, said CPS lawyers had never met or interviewed his daughter about her allegations. ‘We are disappointed that even in light of the subsequent tragedy, the DPP is digging her heels in,’ he added.

An inquest into Miss De Freitas’s death was adjourned in November.
