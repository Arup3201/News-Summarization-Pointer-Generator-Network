Holding his foot in the air while nibbling his toenails, this Japanese macaque looks perfectly at home as he relaxes in a hot spring.

The cheeky monkey even manages to wave to the camera while taking his morning bath in the Jigokudani Yaen-koen wildlife park.

This snow monkey is just one of hundreds of wild primates that live in the mountainous terrain in the northern part of Nagano prefecture.

These photographs were captured by Welsh aircraft engineer Phil Morgan, 45, after he took the trip to the Jigokudani Yaen-koen wildlife park

The images were captured by Welsh aircraft engineer Phil Morgan, 45, who took a holiday in order to photograph the monkeys in their natural habitat.

The Jigokudani Yaen-koen is located at 850 metres above sea level in the Valley of Yokoyu River.

Because of the very steep cliffs and the steam coming off the natural hot springs, ancient people called this valley Jigokudani, which translates as Hell Valley.

The snow monkey - as these macaques are more commonly known - is the most northern dwelling of all primates except humans

The valley in which this nature reserve is situated is covered by snow for a third of the year, during which time the monkeys stick to the hot springs in order to stay warm

The Japanese macaques live wild in this region, making use of the hot springs to bathe in as the valley in covered in snow for almost a third of the year.

They are highly intelligent creatures and live very complex social groups, often fighting over the best spots in the springs.

Agile an dexterous, they have been spotted making and throwing snow ball to entertain themselves, much like humans do.
