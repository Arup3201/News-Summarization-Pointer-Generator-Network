It has taken just seven weeks for John Guidetti to go from the hottest property in Scottish football to being frozen out of the Celtic team.

In between opening his account against Hearts in a 3-0 League Cup win on September 24 and scoring a controversial penalty in a 4-0 win against the same opponents at Tynecastle on November 30, it rained goals for the 22-year-old.

His 11 in 10 appearances, including a stunning League Cup hat-trick against Partick Thistle, had the Celtic fans beseeching their board to shell out the £3million required to land the Swede permanently from Manchester City.

John Guidetti has suffered a dip in form in recent weeks after an excellent start to his Celtic career

That clamour has faded to bemused silence in recent weeks as Guidetti has gone from scoring hero to simply scoring zero. On the pitch, his miserable run of form included six appearances without a goal before Ronny Deila left him on the bench during wins at Hamilton and at home to Motherwell in midweek.

The only YouTube highlights for Guidetti fans to watch in recent weeks have involved a video of the forward giving an impromptu rapping performance, with team-mate Virgil van Dijk on human beatbox.

In Guidetti’s absence from the team Leigh Griffiths, who looked on his way out of Parkhead, has taken on the mantle of golden Bhoy at Parkhead, drawing plaudits from Deila this week for his ‘fantastic’ attitude and ‘world class’ left foot.

With the Celtic manager preferring Stefan Scepovic as an impact substitute, Guidetti appears to have been pushed down to third-choice forward, with Anthony Stokes being deployed out wide left.

It’s not thought Guidetti’s decision to stall talks on a permanent move until April are keeping him out of Deila’s starting XI. In recent weeks the manager has suggested it is just a form dip, saying: ‘All strikers go through periods like this. We have to focus on what is going to get him out of this situation.’

With Griffiths now seemingly in pole position to start next Sunday’s Old Firm QTS League Cup semi-final at Hampden, Guidetti may not get the chance to back up his bold promise to grab a hat-trick against Rangers.

In the middle of his barren run, he vowed to become the first Celtic player since Harry Hood in 1973 to score a hat-trick against the Ibrox side, adding nonchalantly: ‘Diego Costa went four games without a goal a few weeks ago and no one mentioned it — but when John Guidetti does the same it’s the biggest thing in the world. I take it as a compliment.’

If the rise and fall of John Guidetti is a curious case indeed, one property he does not appear to lack is confidence. Yet, according Frank McAvennie, a former Celtic striker who shares Guidetti’s hunger for goals and his off-field sense of fun, it may be that the Manchester City forward is suffering an unexpected bout of self-doubt.

On a previous loan in Holland, Guidetti scored 20 in 23 games for Feyenoord, only for food poisoning from eating chicken to leave him with paralysis of the right leg, ending his season.

Prior to joining Celtic, he had not played for the best part of two years and McAvennie suspects the player may be harbouring an injury and that ghosts of setbacks past may be preying upon him.

‘Maybe John Guidetti’s just biding his time before bursting back into the limelight to score that hat-trick he promised against Rangers,’ chuckles McAvennie.

‘I love the boy’s confidence. You need confidence as a striker. I love his banter and I’d love to see John Guidetti — or anyone — score a hat-trick against Rangers!

‘But it looks to me he may have a wee knock that we don’t know about. Take it from me, you just don’t go from being a super-confident striker scoring 11 in 10 games to not scoring at all.

‘He was flying but almost overnight it’s all changed. That’s why I think he maybe has a knock. Unless you’re 100 per cent fit as a striker you’re maybe going to lack that little extra half-yard of sharpness to get in front of a defender and score goals.

‘Guidetti’s been out long-term before with illness and injury and even though he’s a confident boy, once you’ve had your first big injury you start to worry. It preys on your mind the next time. It’s only human nature.

‘I’m hoping it is just something minor like that and nothing else because I like the boy and he is a very decent player.’

Guidetti’s last goal was a controversial penalty at Tynecastle, awarded by Willie Collum despite there being no contact on the Swede by the sliding Hearts defender Brad McKay. Afterwards, Sky pundit Neil McCann — a former Rangers and Hearts winger — claimed the loanee had ‘thrown himself down’ and ‘conned the referee’.

But McAvennie does not believe the ‘diving’ fallout led to Guidetti’s form crashing. Nor does he view Griffiths as the Swede’s main rival for the leading striking berth.

‘Guidetti never claimed for the penalty, there was no action taken against him and it all died down quickly,’ he said.

‘And he doesn’t seem the type to let that sort of thing affect him anyway.

‘The change in Leigh Griffiths’ fortunes has been interesting. He was seemingly on his way out of the club but now he’s getting picked.

‘I watched him against Motherwell the other night and he’s a typical striker, he gets his head down and there’s no chance of him passing. People were screaming at him to pass against Motherwell. He reminds me of Andy Walker in that regard. He would never pass it either!

‘But I’ve actually got a sneaking feeling that Scepovic is going to be Celtic’s first-choice striker. He’s a decent player, he makes good runs and I think he will come good eventually.’

Frank McGarvey, another maverick former Celtic forward, admits he is equally puzzled as to why Guidetti’s goals have dried up. But he is clear that the player he rates as Celtic’s finest striker should not be given a crack from the start against Rangers.

‘It’s a real mystery and there’s a lot of people scratching their heads on this one,” said McGarvey.

‘John Guidetti was scoring a lot of goals but now the other guys are all ahead of him in the pecking order. If it’s not an injury it must be some kind of internal issue because nobody can understand it.

‘I think Guidetti is the best striker at Celtic, and maybe also the best striker in Scotland. It’s not just his goals, but he brings workrate to the team and his attitude seems great as well.

‘Everyone is looking at the situation and saying: “Why is this guy not getting a game?”.

‘I’ve always thought that if Ronny Deila played Guidetti alongside Leigh Griffiths up front with Kris Commons in behind then Celtic would score goals for fun.

‘But Celtic without Guidetti won 4-0 against Motherwell in midweek and they’ve got maximum points in their last three games. You don’t change a winning team. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. So I wouldn’t start Guidetti against Rangers, even if he is promising to grab a hat-trick.

‘Everything comes out in the wash and I’m sure we will get to the bottom of this situation sometime. But, right now, John Guidetti’s situation is a big mystery...’
