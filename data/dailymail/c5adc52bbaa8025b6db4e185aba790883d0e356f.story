There have been times this season when Diego Costa has left his stamp on a game. This Capital One Cup semi-final was no exception.

The goals, 17 of them so far in a Chelsea shirt, are a welcome distraction from an altogether different side to the forward’s game.

This was a right old tear up, all blood and guts as these two teams took their rivalry, started by Luis Garcia’s ghost goal in the Champions League semi-final in 2005, to another level.

It turned into a ‘he-started-it’ debate between the two managers at the end of this bruising second leg, but Costa is always picking a fight with somebody. He takes no prisoners.

These teams spat and snarled at each other all night, kicking off when Costa left his studs in the ankle of Emre Can after they clashed by the touchline. For that he should have been sent off.

Then there was the moment in extra-time, 102 minutes in when he wrapped his arms around the body of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard on the edge of their penalty area.

Gerrard exploded, shoving his head into the face of Costa as players from both teams converged in yet another unfortunate scuffle. Somehow Gerrard escaped with a caution, as did the Chelsea forward.

This game, brilliantly poised at 1-1 following the first leg, was way too big for referee Michael Oliver. He was way out of his depth.

Radio Five analyst Danny Mills repeatedly called him ‘a bottler’, referencing his failure to award Chelsea a penalty when Martin Skrtel clearly fouled Costa in the first half.

Mourinho went potty, laying in to Phil Dowd, the fourth official, with another verbal battering and waiting for Oliver in the tunnel at the end of the first half. This is not the way to lodge a complaint, but Mourinho was at his petulant worst down there at times.

‘If I speak, people will say it’s Mourinho,’ claimed Chelsea’s manager. ‘If I speak the FA will try to punish me like they always do, or try. But it’s clear when we win the game I still have to ask why.’ With apologies to former Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould for unashamedly appropriating a phrase he used about his 1988 FA Cup winners, Chelsea’s bench is the most badly behaved comprehensive in the country. They are an unruly bunch, constantly screaming in the face of Dowd or jumping up and down in the technical area when decisions do not go their way. Live with it, guys.

We are used to it with Mourinho and the irritating figure of his No2 Rui Faria alongside him, but it is not becoming of Chelsea’s assistant coach Steve Holland. He is better than that.

It is a credit to the any opposition manager - and Brendan Rodgers is included in this - if they can keep their cool when they are standing a yard or so away from Chelsea’s bench.

The provocation and antagonism is unreal at times, a test of patience for any one having to the put up with the constant chirping in the ear of the fourth official. They make anybody want to blow.

The bell inside Mourinho’s head went again in the second half when Oliver should have booked Jordan Henderson for a second time when he deliberately handled. In La Liga, for example, it is a caution.

There was needle all over the pitch, with Lucas Leiva setting the tone when he clattered into Cesc Fabregas as early as the eighth minute. Liverpool took no prisoners.

The Chelsea midfielder was a passenger after that, finally succumbing just moments into the second half when he collided with his captain John Terry.

Lucas was a lucky boy and Mourinho missed Chelsea’s goal, scored by Branislav Ivanovic (another player booked for tugging Raheem Sterling’s shirt) because he was still rabbiting in Dowd’s ear.

He felt that Lucas should have been sent off for clogging Eden Hazard and he was probably right. In the end they scored in any event.

‘I was telling Dowd that Lucas and Henderson should have been sent off already for two yellow cards,’ admitted Mourinho.

He was right, but this was a game when the sparks were flying between these two teams again. The rivalry is back on.

‘Costa is an outstanding footballer but he has an edge to him,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘You can see the incident with Can and he puts his studs on his ankle and it could have been nasty. The one with Skrtel, again, there is no need and he is clever enough if the officials don’t see it.’ As ever, it was Costa who left his mark.
