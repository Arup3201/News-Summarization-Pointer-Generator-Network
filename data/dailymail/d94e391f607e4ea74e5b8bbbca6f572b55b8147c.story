Nick Clegg today brushed aside claims the government sold the Royal Mail on the cheap, insisting Vince Cable who was put in charge ‘is not a sort of share price expert’.

It came after the revelation that the firm’s privatisation at a knock down price cost the taxpayer £1billion, worth £55 for every family in Britain

.Amid growing concerns shares were sold too cheaply, Freedom of Information requests revealed that 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the Royal Mail from £4bn to £4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £3.3bilion.

Sold too low: 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the Royal Mail from £4bn to £4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £3.3bilion

It 
means the 60 per cent stake sold by Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, raised £2billion, 
instead of the £2.9billion he was told he could have secured for the 
taxpayer.

The
 new figures prompted fresh accusations that the UK’s historic postal 
service was privatised too cheaply at the taxpayer’s expense during a 
period of unprecedented austerity.

Chuka
 Umunna, Labour’s shadow business secretary who unearthed them, said the
 government’s failure to get a fair price for Royal Mail had ‘left 
taxpayers short-changed’.

But Mr Clegg leapt to his Lib Dem colleague's defence. Speaking on his LBC 97.3 phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Vince is not a sort of share price expert. He is the Secretary of State who is responsible for this who I think very bravely did something...

‘What I dispute is this idea that somehow Vince Cable single handedly plucked some arbitrary price out of thin air. He didn’t. They did it following advice.

‘It’s clearly an imprecise, unpredictable science. It is a good thing that this company is now being valued as a very good, strong company because that’s vital.

‘Any government when selling a company like that, floating a company like that has got to take independent advice. That is what we’ve done and that is what the Secretary of State, in this case, Vince Cable, did.’

The
 government floated 60 per cent of Royal Mail in October at 330p a 
share, valuing it at £3.3bn and raising almost £2bn for the public 
purse.

Shares went up by more than a third on the first day of trading alone, and broke through the 550p mark within a week.

Business
 Secretary Mr Cable tried to suggest that the price increase was mere
 ‘froth’, but yesterday the shares were still being traded at 585p.

A report into the sale process of the Royal Mail is expected to be published by the Commons business select committee in the next few weeks and the National Audit Office is also investigating.

The new figures support previous claims the sale was ‘catastrophically’ undervalued.

Conservative think tank The Bow Group suggested in November taxpayers might have lost out.It accused ministers of masterminding a privatisation that ‘robbed the taxpayer’ and said shares had been undervalued possibly by as much as £1billion.

Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the group, said at the time: ‘You can sell £10 notes for £5 all day long and call it a success. But this is robbing the overtaxed Brit in a short-sighted fire sale of a valuable national asset.

There are currently restrictions in place on further sales of the remaining 30 per cent of shares, 10 per cent having been given to Royal Mail staff. The remainder of the shares are likely to be sold in tranches after April when the restrictions are lifted.

The figures show that in May 2013 top-end valuations were as high as £8.7 billion.

But by the autumn, after research was completed into investor demand, amid threats of Royal Mail strikes and fears of a US debt default, several experts told select committee hearings these ‘desk-top valuations’ could not be compared. But estimates were still markedly higher than the eventual share price of 330p.

Goldman Sachs and UBS, the lead banks in the floatation, said that was the maximum that institutional investors would pay without starting to drop out.

Even so, ministers and advisers considered raising the price by 20p in the days before the flotation, but feared it would put the sale at risk of failure.

Business Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'We carried out a successful sale that secured almost £2bn for the taxpayer and longterm investors in Royal Mail. We still own a 30 per cent stake in the company and the subsequent rise in the trading price of shares in Royal Mail ensures that taxpayers continue to benefit from any strengthening in the share price.'

At Prime Minister’s questions earlier this week, Mr Cameron said the government 'did a good job to get private sector capital into Royal Mail'.

Last night Mr Umunna said the PM had 'serious questions to answer about why his government sold off Royal Mail on the cheap'.
