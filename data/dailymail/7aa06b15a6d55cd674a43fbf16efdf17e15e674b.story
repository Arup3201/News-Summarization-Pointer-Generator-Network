A group of women aged 19 to 50 have revealed all to raise money for the East Anglian Air Ambulance, for which The Duke of Cambridge is a pilot.

They plan to send Prince William a copy of the 'Country Ladies Uncovered' calendar, which will help raise money to fund the helicopter he flies. 

The 14 women from Huntingdonshire dared to bare in a number of poses in their rural surroundings.

So they are be seen chopping firewood in their knickers, driving a tractor naked and walking through the countryside wearing only riding boots.

In a festive themed shot for December, they pose only wearing Santa hats. 

The pictures were taken by photographer Julie Ayres, 49, from Cambridgeshire and Stevie Thory, from Coates in Liverpool.

Julie said: 'I've wanted to make a calendar for a long time and I'm country born and bred and know lots of equine ladies so it seemed a good theme.'

Trees to protect their modesty: Photographer Julie said the hardest part of the shoot was 'working out who would be willing to show what'

She added of the shoot: 'Once they all got comfortable it was quite easy. The hardest part was the logistics in working out who would be willing to show what.

'They are amazing and I have total admiration for all of them for what they did in aid of charity.

'We plan to send a copy of the calendar to Prince William, I hope he likes it.' 

Prince William has just visited America with the Duchess of Cambridge where the couple received a rapturous reception.

The pair, who are expecting a sibling for their son Prince George next spring, will live at Anmer Hall in Norfolk after completing a £1.5 million makeover of the property.

The country residence will allow the Duke to be based at Cambridge Airport where he will be part of a team of clinicians who provide pre-hospital emergency medicine at the scene of accidents across the Eastern region.

Last year the charity flew 1,440 missions and attended more than 1,000 patients, including 414 people involved in road traffic accidents.

Julie said the fantastic work carried out by the charity was the reason why the women volunteered to strip off.

She said: 'Most of us live in the countryside and ride and we know it's likely we may have to call on the air ambulance at some time.

'I have seen the pilots land in some very precarious places and I'm in awe of them, so we wanted to do something to help the charity.'
