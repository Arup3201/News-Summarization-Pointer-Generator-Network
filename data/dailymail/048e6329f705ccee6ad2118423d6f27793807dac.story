In a claim reportedly worth $1.62 billion, Brisbane-born dance choreographer Wade Robson alleges he was extensively molested, raped and even called 'son' by Michael Jackson.

Mr Robson, 31, met Jackson as a five-year-old and claims the dead singer sexually abused him from age seven to 14.

He alleges the molestation took place at the late singer's Santa Barbara County ranch and other locations in the from 1990 until 1997 although Jackson's estate lawyers have called the accusations outrageous and pathetic, reported Radar Online.

The claims, including that Mr Robson posed naked during sex acts, were revealed in a 111-page document filed against the singer's estate, MJJ productions, in the Los Angeles Superior Court, reported News.com.au.

The documents state the late singer told Mr Robson if anyone found out about the sexual acts, both their careers would be over and that they would go to jail. 

Allegations also include Jackson inviting Mr Robson and his family to stay at his ranch in February, 1990.

Its also alleged Jackson’s company helped Mr Robson apply for a U.S. work visa and employed his mother Joy in 1991.

Mr Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away.

The estate has asked to court to reject the claims on the basis that Mr Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years.

The claims come after years of supporting the U.S. singer through child abuse allegations.

In 2005, Mr Robson even testified in court that Jackson had never sexually abused him and this helped the singer beat charges of molestation in California.

The Australian said the birth of his son, Jackson's death and therapy that followed two breakdowns triggered his understanding that he had been molested. 

Jackson's estate has rubbished the claims and has asked the court to reject them
