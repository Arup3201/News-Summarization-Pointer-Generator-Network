An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later today at Point Nepean in southern Victoria.

Hundreds of relatives of those who fought attended the special centenary ceremony held at the Point Nepean barracks which lays claim to firing the first shot of all the British allied forces during World War I.

It was the first incident involving Australian troops with the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared in Australia an entire century ago.

An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later on this day at Point Nepean in southern Victoria

The Last Stand was played at the ceremony attended by hundreds of loved ones and dignataries

Federal environment minister Greg Hunt, who attended the ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, said nobody could have imagined the years following the first shot and the sacrifices that would be made from a population from just under 5 million.

‘417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,’ he said. ‘Of the 270,000 to return more than half had been wounded and others had mental scars which never healed.’

‘We acknowledge those who have done what we have not.’

Although England declared war on Germany at 11 pm in London on August 4, 1914, it was not announced in Australia until 12.30pm on 5 August by then Prime Minister Joseph Cook due to the time difference.

At the moment the war was declared, the German freighter Pfalz (outbound from Melbourne) sailed to Point Nepean to have her papers checked. Being found in order, she was given clearance to resume her voyage to sea under the guidance of an Australian pilot.

At 12.45 pm, however, the declaration of war was flashed to Point Nepean and before the ship could reach the entrance, a shot was fired across her bows as an order to return to port.

The Pfalz then anchored off Portsea, the master and crew were interned, and the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier.

The battle was the first war to have been fought by land, sea and air

One of those who returned was James Rule who was only 24 when he joined the Western Australian Imperial Regiment and embarked for northern Africa in 1914. After training in Egypt, he was deployed to Gallipoli where he quickly learnt the difficulty of war.

He told his children how some of his friends had died in his arms; how not all the ANZAC soldiers had rifles and some men had to take them from dead soldiers in order to defend themselves; how the Australian soldiers did not have enough to eat, but that the British soldiers would sometimes share their rations with them and how it was a particular treat when the British would share their dark chocolate.

Though he survived the war and returned to Australia where he had eight children and lived until he was 78, he would talk on occasion about the horrendous terrain, the poor planning and how he waded through water infested with maggots because of the decomposing bodies left in the trenches.

In what was perhaps his last photograph before that ordeal, James Rule posed with the other 702 members of the 11th Battalion on the Great Pyramid of Giza in what is now one of the most iconic photographs of Australia's involvement in the First World War.

On the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of The Great War, Rule is one of the few men who have been identified from the photograph and whose story is known.

The section of the photograph that James Rule (third from right) features in is the source of many myths, including that the linked men were all related and died the day after the photograph was taken

The Western Australian Genealogical Society has divided the photograph up in a grid and assigned each soldier a number, the year numbers are people who are partially verified, the green number represent those whose identities are fully verified

His daughter Beth Smith, 72, has been involved in the project of finding the identities and stories of the other soldiers.

Mrs Smith, a retired school registrar from Perth, says she has known about the photograph for a long time and bought a print 15 years ago.

'There's no photo of war like that, really. There are so many stories to tell about each of the men, it's quite amazing... It is a very interesting piece of history in the one photo. Naturally I'm quite proud, my dad is in it,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The photograph is mentioned in the diary of Captain Barnes from the 11th Battalion, who wrote on Sunday January 10, 1915: 'After Church this morning the whole Battalion was marched up to the Pyramid (Old Cheops) and we had a photo took or at least several of them.'

There is incredible detail in the photograph, for instance, Mrs Smith says that one of the kneeling officers in the front row is holding a whistle, which was used to tell the men when the photograph was about to be taken to make sure they were all looking in the same direction.

In fact, Mrs Smith's father is the source of some of the more persistent rumours about the photograph. He is pictured in a row of four men, all with their arms crossed, all holding hands.

One myth is that the group was a father and three brothers, all of whom died the following day, which is false.

James Rule returned to Australia where he had eight children, including Beth (pictured) who has been working on finding the stories of those in the photograph. He is pictured in 1966 at the age of 75, three years before he died

Mrs Smith says that she and her sister were once visiting Ballarat in Victoria and saw the photograph for sale in a shop.

'One shop told us that they [her father and the three other men] were all from that town and they all died. It's quite amusing.'

'I do wonder what that was about and I wish I'd asked him when he was alive,' she said.

The Western Australian Genealogical Society have launched an appeal to identify the remaining soldiers in the photograph. They are asking for people who may have had relatives in the 11th Battalion to send in information and have created a grid and numbering system so that each person is easy to identify.

Mrs Smith, who has been conducting research about the wartime experiences of some of the men in the photograph, could then send the relatives some information about their ancestor and what they went through in the war.

'I think it would be so exciting [to discover your relative in the photograph] because whenever I see an old photo of one of my ancestors I always get so excited and such an iconic photo as it is, you'd be even more flabbergasted, it would be phenomenal,' she said.
