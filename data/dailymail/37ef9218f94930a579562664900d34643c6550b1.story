A woman was run over by a pair of dognappers as they stole her French bulldog puppy.

Rhiannon Jones, 27, said she was targeted by the thieves after offering to sell her pedigree pet - worth up to £5,000 - to them.

The men asked to take the dog, Titch, for a walk before throwing him into their van.

Rhiannon Jones, 27, says she was run over by a couple of thieves who stole her French bulldog puppy, Titch

Ms Jones said she tried to stop them but was knocked down by their van and tried to cling on as they drove off.

‘The men seemed genuine - I didn’t expect them to try and steal Titch,’ she said.

‘When I went after them, the men, who I had been speaking to only moments earlier, came at me.

‘I was lifted off the road and on to the bonnet of the car - I was clinging on to the van as it sped round the corner.

‘They’ve got no windscreen wipers now - I ripped them off.’

The University of South Wales student said she loved the dog, a present from her boyfriend, but realised she was going to have to give him up because of how much time she would be spending outside of the house for her sports science course.

The third-year student put the dog up for sale on PreLoved, a classified listings website.

Ms Jones chose to put Titch up for sale when she realised she would not have time to care for him at university

The men phoned and came to visit the dog at her home in Aberdare, South Wales.

They asked to see a certificate to prove Titch was five-generation pedigree and, while Rhiannon was looking for it, they tried to make off with the dog.

She ran out of her home to confront them in the street but was hit by their red minivan as they drove off.

Ms Jones was comforted by neighbours before going to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.

Police are now tracing the dognappers after the owner, who was not seriously injured, reported the incident.

Officers fear Titch could be sold on the black market where he could fetch up to £5,000.

A police spokesman said: ‘We are taking it very seriously and we are of course concerned for the welfare of the animal.

‘We do believe they’ll be trying to sell it. If anyone has been offered a dog of this description we urge them to come forward.’

The men who allegedly stole Titch are described as mixed-race with strong Cardiff accents.

One is described as around 25-years-old, 5ft 9ins, with blue-green eyes and a medium build.

The driver of the vehicle is described as tall, with grey eyes and a slim build.
