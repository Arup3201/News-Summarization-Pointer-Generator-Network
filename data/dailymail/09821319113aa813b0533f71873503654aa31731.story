This  lighthouse in Norway has been turned into the ultimate romantic hideaway - as a one-room hotel for couples.

Molja Lighthouse in Aalesund, Norway, is just three metres wide but has been converted for two guests with one bedroom.

The 50-year-old construction sits on the end of a 100-metre long jetty and still boasts an automated flashing red and green beacon that guides ships into sheltered waters.

The Molja Lighthouse offers guests the perfect secluded getaway with surrounding panoramic views

There is also 24-hour room service, an in-room mini bar and a concierge on hand to cater to guests' every need.

A spokesperson for the hotel said: 'Molja Lighthouse presented a delightful challenge to our interior architect and carpenters.

'Downstairs is a very elegant and amazingly compact bathroom while upstairs is a circular bedroom with a custom-fitted bed.

'Guests will appreciate stunning views from their bed of Godøya Island and the Atlantic, watching the Hurtigruten coastal steamer glide by.

The lighthouse, which is located in Aalesund, Norway, is 50-years-old and it is full of character and charm

The Molja Lighthouse is now primarily aimed at attracting tourists and the natural beauty is breathtaking

The stunning Lighthouse Hotel is a perfect escape from the trials and tribulations of everyday life

The sole room in the 'Molja Lighthouse is bright, beautifully decorated, intimate and romantic

The room also has a  window that is conveniently close to the bed so guests can wake up to panoramic views

'Today, Molja's red-and-green beacon is automated but still guides ships into sheltered waters.

'The hotel provides a very special experience to share with someone you love.

'It's a thrilling bridal suite, whether the setting midsummer sun has turned sea and sky golden, or an autumn storm is sending salty sprays high into the air - hold onto your bridal gown and bow tie as you walk hand in hand out the jetty.'

Prices for the hotel, listed on GoUnusual.com, start from £275.
