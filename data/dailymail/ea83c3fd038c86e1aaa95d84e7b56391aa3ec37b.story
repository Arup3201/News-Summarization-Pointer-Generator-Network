Horrific attack: Stuart Walker may have been sexually assaulted before he was killed in Cumnock

A barman beaten and set on fire in an alleged homophobic attack may have been sexually assaulted before he was killed, police said last night.

The body of 28-year-old Stuart Walker was found in an empty industrial estate in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The openly gay barman was the victim of a ‘violent and sustained’ attack as he walked back from a house party.

In the hours after his death, his small community of Cumnock, Ayrshire, was rife with rumours he was targeted because of his sexuality.

Strathclyde Police have refused to confirm or deny this but Divisional Commander John Thomson said the  victim’s lifestyle was the ‘main focus’ of his inquiries.

As it was reported that Mr Walker’s body was found partially undressed, Mr Thomson said a sexual element to the crime had not been ruled out.

But Initial reports that he was tied to a lamp post were incorrect, officers said.

At a press conference at Kilmarnock police office, he confirmed Mr Walker – a former assistant manager at the Royal Hotel in Cumnock – had almost certainly known those who killed him at Caponacre industrial estate.

Mr Thomson said: ‘I don’t think it was a random attack by someone who will strike again. I suspect Stuart may have known this individual or met this individual shortly before his death.’

Mr Thomson, who described the murder as a ‘vicious attack’, said there was a  ‘possibility of a sexual assault’.

The post-mortem examination will reveal whether that was the case.

Mr Walker’s charred remains were discovered at 4.50am by party-goers, after being last seen by a friend alive at 2:30am.

The sociable music fan had been at a number of friends’ house parties on the nearby Netherthird housing estate until the early hours.

He then took the route back to the house he shared with parents David, 63, and Isabel, 56, and 24-year-old sister Julie in Hearth Place, Cumnock.

He was last seen alive and alone close to the town fire station in Glazier Street by a family friend.

But Mr Walker, a former gym supervisor, changed route and bypassed his house to go to the industrial estate.

Police are unsure if he was taken there or went of his own accord, and whether he removed his own clothing.

His family first became worried when Mr Walker did not turn up at his grandmother Margaret McMeekin’s 80th birthday party on Saturday.

He also failed to appear for his fourth shift at a new job behind the bar of the First Edition pub in nearby Kilmarnock.

It was not until his family raised the alarm that police were able to identify Mr Walker.

Officers have interviewed dozens of potential witnesses, conducted door-to-door inquiries and studied CCTV footage.

Mr Thomson said: ‘I am  optimistic we will bring this person or persons to book sooner rather than later.’

Detective Inspector John Hogg of Ayr police added: 'We are still working towards identifying a motive for this murder.

'I am aware of all the speculation in the media regarding Mr Walker and his death. At this time,we have nothing to indicate that this is a homophobic crime.

Until we know the exact circumstances 
surrounding this murder, we will not rule anything out and will keep an 
open mind on any possible motive for his terrible crime.'

Members of the gay community in Ayrshire are among more than 4,000 people who have visited a Facebook page set up in memory of Mr Walker.

A spokesperson for the bar Stuart had just started working at, told The Guardian: 'We are all shocked at the death of Stuart and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.'

And the director of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender support group Stonewall Scotland, Colin Macfarlane, told the newspaper: 'Stonewall Scotland are deeply worried that the police feel there may be a possibility that his death was a hate crime.'
