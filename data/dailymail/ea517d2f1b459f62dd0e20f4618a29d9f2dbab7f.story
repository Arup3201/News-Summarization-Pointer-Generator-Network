The woman at the centre of Kurtley Beale’s latest scandals is currently on ‘heavily medication’, according to Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie.

The Australian team’s former business manager, Di Patston resigned from her role as Wallabies business manager on Friday ‘due to stress’. 

Controversial rugby star Kurtley Beale could potentially be sacked this week, as the Integrity Unit continue their investigation into two separate incidents involving Ms Patston.

Last week, Ms Patston notified the Wallabies' integrity unit about sexually explicit texts sent by Beale in June, which ridiculed the team's only female official.

Beale was already being investigated after allegedly verbally abusing Ms Patston on a team flight from South Africa to South America last month.

At a media press conference on Tuesday afternoon, McKenzie opened up about the distress Ms Patston is experiencing , as well as the responsibility he feels for her current predicament.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie revealed Ms Patston is currently on 'heavy medication' as she struggles to deal with the fallout after her altercations with Kurtley Beale

That move came while the ARU was considering disciplinary action against Beale after a mid-air row with Patston as the Wallabies travelled from South Africa to Argentina for their final Rugby Championship test.

Local media have since focused on Patston's work history, casting doubts over her qualifications and questioning the ARU's due diligence in their hiring.

McKenzie, who was moved to deny having had an 'intimate relationship' with Patston in an extraordinary media conference last week, defended her again on Tuesday and revealed the extent of her turmoil.

Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds

'I've got a former staff member out there who is heavily medicated, without a job and without job prospects,' he said. 

'She did an outstanding job for me for a long period of time and made a massive contribution,' said McKenzie.

'But now (Di's) suddenly out there on the outer and under massive pressure.'

Wallabies inside centre Christian Leali'ifano has also come out in support of Ms Patston, explaining that her resignation feels like 'losing a mother'.

'I sort of treated her as a mother and she was the same to me and she was like my sounding board if I had any troubles,' Leali'ifano said, according to SMH.

'I can't fault anything she has done for the team.

'She worked countless hours and I was always going over to her and telling her to take a break but she always had things on to make this team better.'

Ms Patston was reportedly recruited to her position with the Wallabies by McKenzie, after working as McKenzie's personal assistant whilst he was the coach of Queensland Reds.

During the press conference, McKenzie explained he had a responsibility to ensure Ms Patston's wellbeing whilst working with the Wallabies, after bringing her.

'When you employ someone you bring them into that environment. But then when that environment then cast them out…' he said.

'I do feel responsible for her welfare so I can't then not take that responsibility.'

'She's out there on her own and it's a difficult place to be.'

McKenzie also indicated that he is currently more concerned about Ms Patston's future than he is about his own, as he faces speculation that he will be outsted as Wallabies' coach.

'If you google (Di's) name it'll be difficult for her to get a job so I think it's been a really difficult time.

'The speculation about my job probably isn't front of mind for me.

'There's a lot of other issues going on at the moment and I like to make sure that I'm attending to things that are important.

'I monitor her welfare.' 

Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked.

'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper.

'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.' 

The scandal has completely overshadowed the Wallabies' preparations for their third and final Bledisloe Cup test against world champions New Zealand in Brisbane on Saturday. 

Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina
