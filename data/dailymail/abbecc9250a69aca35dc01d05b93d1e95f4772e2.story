Glamorous: Emel Dilek was put on a salary of $120,000-a-year by her lover Ronald Pecunies

The mistress of a luxury car-dealer has lost her court battle to enforce a lucrative employment contract he had secretly given her before his death.

Emel Dilek had been put on a $120,000-a-year contract by her lover Ronald Pecunies, 80, who
was a minority owner and Chief Operations Officer of Mercedes-Benz dealers Watson Enterprises, which is based in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The 34-year-old enjoyed a number of other perks, including a luxury SUV.

Dilek claimed she was a valuable employee but other part-owners of the firm argued she was a 'kept woman'.

Yesterday, she lost her battle to legally 
force the company to honour the remainder of the four-year contract - 
worth $385,000 - at a Manhattan federal court.

Judge Paul Oetken ruled that Mr Pecunies did not have the authority to give a contract without the permission of majority owner Arthur Watson Junior, according to The New York Post.

Mr Pecunies ,
who remained married while in a relationship with Dilek, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2009.

Shortly before his death, he used a private lawyer to draw up a contract with Dilek.

There were no witnesses present when he signed it and he never mentioned it to Mr Watson.

The octogenarian died in May 2010 and Mr Watson immediately cancelled the four-year contract with Dilek.

He told the court that the only thing she did for the company on a regular basis was 'to sleep with Ron'.

Judge
Oetken added that while Mr Watson and Mr Pecunies had 
no-questions-asked 'gentlemen’s agreement' regarding the employment of 
their respective wives and girlfriends, it could not be enforced after 
his death.  

Dilek met Mr Pecunies at a fundraiser in
2004. She had been working for Mercedes-Benz USA as an intern at the 
time and had organized the event in her native Germany.

Her lover allegedly brought her to the US, arranged for her to have a work permit and gave her a job.

When questioned in court, she claimed she saw him for two years before she found out he was married.

She also alleged that he was separated from his wife - and had been for three decades. Dilek described him as the 'love of her life', adding 'I have an old soul and he had a young spirit.'
