Twitter users anywhere in the world can control the lights on a holiday display in New Jersey.

Tweets will turn on a 9-foot Christmas tree, menorah and over 1,000 LED lights at Oxford Communications in Lambertville and also turn them off.

Tweet #brilliant#twinkle to @Oxmas_Tree to light the display and tweet #figgyypudding to turn them off.

The OXmas Tree's Twitter page has shared photographs of the lit tree after fans tweeted

The company says it designed the display with the intention to help charities, towns and businesses to develop awareness and fundraising campaigns.

Senior Interactive Project Manager at Oxford Communications, Martin Slamon, who led the initiative told NJ.com: 'The purpose of the @Oxmas_Tree is to empower philanthropic organizations to transform their holiday displays into gamified, socially-engaged awareness and fundraising opportunities.'

'The @Oxmas_Tree proves it can be done.'

The Twitter hashtags control the lights because the @Oxmas_Tree is connected to an Arduino - an open source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.

The system transforms tweets and hashtags into electronic impulses.
