She is more famed for her comic dance moves and hilarious outfits on Strictly Come Dancing than her sartorial choices.

But when Ann Widdecombe stepped out of the ITV Daybreak studios in London this morning, she appeared to have undergone something of a style overhaul.

The former British Conservative Party politician, 65, looked rather more glamorous than usual in an on-trend indigo wrap dress with matching cardigan and shimmering silver tights.

Feeling blue: The former MP is holding a hobble - which is used to tether animals - made of dishcloths. The animal charity she works with is asking Moroccan donkey owners to replace wire hobbles with fabric ones

Wearing a full face of make-up, loosely curled hair and black kitten heels, Ann showed off a more youthful, feminine side than we are used to seeing.

Ann was leaving the studios after appearing on the Daybreak sofa with Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly.

Youthful: Ann, 65, showcased a more youthful and feminine side with loosely curled hair and bronzed skin

She was being interviewed about a film she had made investigating animal cruelty in Morocco. The former Maidstone MP visited the country this week, which she described as having a ‘hidden workforce 
of donkeys, horses and mules’

Over
half of British tourists would be put off a holiday destination if they
witnessed animal cruelty while there, a YouGov survey has found.

Ann
was spotted leaving the studios in central London holding is a hobble –
used to stop animals escaping - made of dishcloths. The charity she’s 
working with is encouraging donkey owners to use these instead of wire 
hobbles, which are extremely painful and dangerous for the animals.

‘There
are a 100 million working animals worldwide – we can’t treat every 
single one but we can see that their owners know more,' she said.

Her usual look: The former Maidstone MP recently visited Morocco to investigate animal cruelty in a country which has a 'hidden workforce of donkeys, horses and mules'

Lorraine asked if she’d be watching Strictly – ‘Of course – and I’m backing Anton forever.’

The outspoken former Tory minister, who is currently penning a tell-all book about her time in politics, recently dismissed the idea that Westminster was biased against women, and 
insisted both sexes were ‘roughed up’ during debates.

In
remarks likely divide opinion in Parliament, Miss Widdecombe said women
must not go into politics with a ‘sense of grievance’.

Miss Widdecombe, who was prisons 
minister in John Major’s last government, insisted those women who do 
choose a career in politics had to prove their commitment, and realise 
having a family might not be conducive to the rough and tumble of life 
in Westminster.
