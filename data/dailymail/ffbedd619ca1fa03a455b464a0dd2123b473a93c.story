Kieran Gibbs will start England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley after Leighton Baines was ruled out through injury.

The Arsenal left back plays for Roy Hodgson’s side at Wembley because Luke Shaw has not been named in the 23 man squad to face Slovenia.

Shaw was apparently due to be rested for the clash with Slovenia and was not named in the squad lodged with UEFA before the noon deadline on Friday.

Baines has returned to Goodison Park for treatment on his injury and will not be able to face Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

The injury to England’s first choice left back means Gibbs will be promoted to play in his place.

Shaw, who has just got in to the Manchester United team following injury, is expected to step in to face Gordon Strachan’s side on Tuesday.

Despite the injury to Baines, England are unable to make any changes to the original 23 man squad list lodged earlier on Friday.

Gibbs has won four caps for England with his last appearance coming against San Marino in October
