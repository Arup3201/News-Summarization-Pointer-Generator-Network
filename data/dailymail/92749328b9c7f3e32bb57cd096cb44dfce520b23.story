The first new ‘baby’ Land Rover Discovery has been spotted on British Roads – under heavy disguise.

The camouflaged car was spotted in Coventry where Jaguar Land Rover has its world-leading Whitley design and engineering centre.

The new Discovery is the latest model announced by prolific Jaguar Land Rover, which is experiencing its greatest ever period.

What is believed to be the new'baby' Land Rover Discovery has been spotted in Coventry before it is on sale. But the new car has been covered in an eye-catching pattern, to stop petrolheads spotting the new design

The spotted car was camouflaged, but there were clear signs that it is a prototype of the new Discovery family, which was unveiled at the New
 York International Motor Show earlier this month.

The new Discovery Sport will be the 
first in a brand new ‘Discovery family’ of upmarket 4X4s.

They will go on 
sale in showroom next year priced at between £25,000 and £45,000.

Land Rover, which describes the new off-roader as a ‘premium compact sports utility vehicle’, says the model will be more ‘versatile’ than the long-running Freelander, which comes to the end of the road after nearly 15 years.

There is speculation that it will include seven seats, just as the existing larger Discovery model already features.

Jaguar Land Rover is experiencing one of its best periods, with sales and profits booming, thanks to models such as the Range Rover Evoque and the stunning Jaguar F-Type. 

Last year, MailOnline revealed how teenager Rob Barker spotted the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe six
 months before it went on sale.

The
 £80,000 sought-after sports car was seen by the 18-year-old in a 
supermarket car park in Leamington Spa, which is around ten miles from 
the company's headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

In
 July MailOnline also reported how the brand new Rolls Royce Wraith was 
spotted in the street as one of the engineers tested it on the road 
before it went on sale.

The pictures emerged before it had even made its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex.

In November, MailOnline revealed how teenager Rob Parker spotted the Jaguar F-Type coupe in a supermarket car park six months before it went on sale

The car, which made its debut at the Los Angeles motor show, was spotted in Leamington Spa, around ten miles from Gaydon, Warwickshire, where the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover is based

The latest launch from the company will see the Land Rover range split into three distinct groups – luxurious Range Rover, versatile Discovery and
 down-to-earth Defender.

Range Rover will spread from the largest version to the compact Evoque.

Go-anywhere Defenders could range from big and beefy to a small, fun, open-topped beach-buggy style versions.

Land Rover design director and chief creative officer Gerry McGovern announced at New York Show:  ‘I am proud to confirm the nameplate that will make Discovery a family of vehicles for the first time. It will be called Discovery Sport and will go on sale in 2015.

‘This will be the most versatile and capable sports utility vehicle in its segment and is the first expression of the Discovery Vision Concept unveiled here in New York.’

He added: ’This car encapsulates our vision for a Discovery family. Rather than produce one car that fits all, we wanted to do a family that can broaden our reach – just as the Evoque did with Range Rover.’

Last week, Land Rover unveiled its new Discovery Concept, above, which can be driven 'at very low speed' using a smart phone, tablet or the car's removable console

Mr McGovern said the SUV market will be more than 20 million cars a year by 2020 and that the biggest sector will be leisure SUVs.

He said: ’We’ve produced a very dramatic, distinctive silhouette that’s very premium, but with a visual robustness.

‘The car hides its size well. As with the Range rover, we’ve used visual trickery, with lamps that wrap around to make the car look compact and a higher butt to make it look athletic.’

A Land Rover spokesman said: ’This demonstrates Land Rover’s design vision for a future family of premium sports utility vehicles built on  our key principles of emotive design, unrivalled capability and ultimate versatility.'

The company is also investing billions in research and development and the hard work is paying off. Last year it delivered 425,000 vehicles, an increase of 19 per cent.

One unique feature of the prototype 'Discovery Vision' will be a remote-control drive, which allows anyone to drive the vehicle while not actually seated inside it

The flash car will also feature laser positioning sensors, gesture-controlled systems and an 'invisible' bonnet that allows the driver to 'see through' the car to the ground beneath

Land Rover used the prototype 
‘Discovery Vision’ in New York to showcase its cutting-edge James Bond 
style technology which boasts a range of gadgets, including a remote 
control drive.

The company said the car could be driven at a 'very low speed' without anyone in 
the driver's seat, either using a smart phone, console or the car's own 
removable console.

It also includes ‘see-through’ technology that gives drivers the sense of  Superman-style ‘x-ray eyes’ to look beyond the metal at what danger lurk beneath their vehicles.

That system combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  ‘transparent’ bonnet.

A Land Rover spokesman said: ‘The technology provides full visibility of what is underneath and in front of the car, with total clarity of otherwise hidden obstacles.

‘It enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels.

‘It breaks new ground in visual driver assistance. And it shows how advanced technology will take Land Rover’s unrivalled capability to the next level.’
