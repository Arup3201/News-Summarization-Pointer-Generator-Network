It is one of Europe's most elite clubs whose members luxuriate in a world of almost unimaginable privilege.

But though it is very difficult to become a full-time 21st century royal, it is possible to emulate the super-chic queens, princesses and duchesses who make up its ranks.

The unmistakeable 'uniform' of Europe's chicest elite was deployed to full effect by the continent's newest queen today as Mathilde of Belgium stepped out of the shadow of mother-in-law Paola to take the throne.

Dressed in a fitted cream shift dress with a distinctive neckline that folded back from her shoulder, she exuded sophistication as she stood at her husband Philippe's side in the country's Royal Palace on the day he became king.

The 40-year-old, who married her husband in 1999, accessorised her outfit with ladylike short cream gloves and neutral clutch bag,
 hat and shoes. While the fascinating material headpiece was a rosy hue,
 her envelope clutch and pointed court shoes were a more earthy beige 
colour.

Her highlighted 
caramel blonde hair was neatly tucked away in an elegant chignon, 
allowing her beautiful pearl and diamond earrings to take centre stage. 
She also wore a matching bracelet. Mathilde's make-up was neutral and 
light. She had applied a smooth, matte base, kohl, mascara and soft pink
 lipstick.

It was a look that would certainly have won the approval of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Philippe, 53, acceded the throne after his father Albert, 79, decided to abdicate after 20 years reign.Â 

He signed 
away his rights as the kingdom's largely ceremonial ruler at the Royal 
Palace in the presence of Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who holds the 
political power in this 183-year-old parliamentary democracy.

The Queen's make up was natural and her up do allowed her elegant pearl and diamond jewellery to take centre stage

The outgoing king said: 'Belgium is modernizing itself and it gives me joy.'

The former King took the unusual decision to abdicate just three weeks ago on health grounds.

Under crystal chandeliers in a gilded hall at the Royal Palace, Di Rupo called Albert 'a great head of state'.

He added: 'You are closing an important page in the history of our country.'

Mathilde wore mid-heel elegant pointed beige courts with neat bow detailing and matching clutch bag. Her neat chignon was tucked under a rosy hued hat

Earlier both Albert and Philippe 
mingled with the crowds under a royal blue sky following a Catholic 
ceremony at the Cathedral of St Michael and Saint Gudula that set off 
the festivities.

King Albert announced his abdication 
plans less than three weeks ago, so there was little time to turn the 
occasion into a huge international event.

No foreign royals were at the 
ceremony. Since the royal transition coincides with Belgium's national 
day celebrations, a military parade had already been planned.
