Damon is the latest member of the Ripley cast to pay respects to Hoffman. On Monday, Cate Blanchett flew in from California to visit the family of her fellow Oscar winner.

The Australian actress arrived with toys at the West Village, Manhattan home Hoffman shared until recently with partner Mimi O'Donnell and their three young children, all under the age of 11.

The costume designer kicked Hoffman 
out late last year in a show of 'tough love' as he had relapsed and was 
using heroin. He then rented an apartment nearby, in which he was found 
dead on Sunday.

On Sunday
 Gwyneth Paltrow, Blanchett and Hoffman's Talented Mr. Ripley co-star, 
tweeted a tribute to the actor from their time together filming in 
Italy.

The actress posted a vintage snap of herself and actor Jude Law from behind the scenes of the film on location in Italy.

Paltrow wrote: 'Ischia 1998, post dinner, post shooting... Philip was a true genius. #philipseymourhoffman.'
