Stuart McCall has sent a warning to Bilel Mohsni as he insisted Rangers will need cool heads for the promotion run-in.

The Tunisian centre-back extended his questionable disciplinary record by picking up a booking for reacting to opposition fans during Thursday’s 3-0 defeat from Queen of the South.

McCall believes Mohsni has good defensive attributes but is adamant the Ibrox side cannot risk unnecessary suspensions as they attempt to land a Premiership place via the play-offs.

Stuart McCall calls time on training ahead of Rangers match with Raith on Sunday

‘I’ve had to have a word with him over his concentration levels,’ said McCall. ‘He did some absolutely outstanding things in the game and then he did some slack and sloppy things.

‘I didn’t know what he was booked for and Kenny (Black) had said it was a reaction to their fans. He was probably frustrated and angry at the result.

‘But I’ll have another look at it as we can’t afford to have silly bookings at this point in the season. Ian Black got one the other day and there are a couple of other lads a game away from being suspended.

‘If it’s for tackles you can maybe understand it but we can’t afford cheap bookings for running to the crowd, taking your shirt off, back chat with referees, kicking the ball away – I don’t like things like that. It’s a lack of discipline.’

Rangers will attempt to bounce back from the first loss of McCall’s tenure when they host Raith on Sunday. They currently sit behind second-placed Hibs on goal difference but have a game in hand.

‘There will be a lot of big games, big crowds, tension and drama until the last kick of the season,’ added McCall ‘So cool heads is the way to go. But I still like fire in the belly. I don’t want people to surrender meekly and mildly. Nothing wrong with a bit of passion as long as it’s channelled in the right way.’

McCall insisted the Palmerston reverse shouldn’t be viewed as a ‘disaster’ and feels he already has evidence of his side’s ability to recover from disappointments.

‘We just have to draw a line under it. I don’t want doom and gloom. We drew the first two games when I came here. That wasn’t what we wanted, so we bounced back from those. We then went on a decent run and now we’ve had another setback. It’s about how we react.’
