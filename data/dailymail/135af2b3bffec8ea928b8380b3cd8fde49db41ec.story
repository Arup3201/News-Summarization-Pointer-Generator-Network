A primary school teacher has been accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes - by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it.

Philip Meredith restrained the child under a beanbag the size of a double bed at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales while the youngster shouted ‘get off, get off’, a professional conduct committee hearing was told.

A teaching assistant working in Mr Meredith’s classroom at the time of the alleged incident told the hearing how she could see the child – named only as ‘Pupil A’ - ‘kicking’ as he tried to free himself.

Ellen Sheldon said ‘There was a fight between Pupil A and another child. Pupil A was put into a restraint by Mr Meredith onto the bean bag.

‘I didn’t see how he got from there to under the bean bag. I could see his feet kicking and he was shouting “Get off, get off”.

‘I would estimate he was under the bean bag for four to five minutes.’

Sobbing throughout her evidence she told the panel: ‘I’ve never had to deal with anything like this on my life and I never want to deal with it again.

‘It’s made me feel ill.’

She reported the incident - which allegedly happened on November 17, 2011 - the following month and Mr Meredith was subsequently suspended. He was later dismissed. 

Mr Meredith is now appearing before a General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) professional conduct committee facing seven charges of professional misconduct.

It is alleged that while he was employed at the school he shouted at Pupil A, final year pupil aged 10 or 11, and spoke 'overly loudly' to him, when it was not necessary or appropriate to do so.

He denies the claim but admits he has a 'naturally loud voice'.

He is also accused of telling Pupil A to sit in the 'thinking chair' when the child’s behaviour did not justify the sanction.

In another allegation, he is also accused of holding Pupil A on the floor with his face against the carpet.

The primary school teacher is also accused of holding a second child - Pupil B - by the front of his shirt and also holding him on the floor with his face against the carpet.

He denies all of the allegations. 

Head teacher Alison Dacey told the hearing that Mr Meredith was appointed in September 2011 to a role which involved teaching some of the more demanding pupils at the 430-pupil school.

Ms Dacey said some of the pupils 'had very challenging behaviour' and she added that 'unruly and violent behaviour' was not uncommon.

She said she was very pleased with his appointment during his first few weeks in the post, describing his relationship with the children and the response he could get out of them in the early stages of his employment as 'breathtakingly wonderful'.

'There was huge potential for him,' she told the hearing. 'If he adhered to the support system in the school we wouldn’t be here today.'

Numerous measures were taken to address 'a number of concerns' about Mr Meredith’s conduct and behaviour in the school that arose 'from quite early on', Ms Dacey said. 

These related to his teaching and classroom organisation as well as 'shouting and yelling' at pupils. 

She also had to speak to him about body proximity and respecting the personal space of the children.

'I was quite concerned from an early stage about the way he spoke to the children,' she said. 'He seemed to shout at them. We have a no shouting policy in the school.

'I spoke to him about it on several occasions and encouraged him to reduce the volume of his voice.'

She said Mr Meredith frequently failed to write up restraint forms after incidents and there were many occasions where she was only aware of restraints when the children bragged about them.

Ms Dacey recalled how on September 18, 2011, Pupil A had a red mark on his arm which he said happened following a restraint by Meredith.

She said: 'It had the appearance of carpet burn and was a couple of days old and it had blistering on it. No restraint form had been completed.'

The head teacher added: 'There continued to be a number of concerns about Mr Meredith. Most were relevant to his teaching and classroom organisation.'

The hearing, in Cardiff, continues.
