A Los Angeles County jury has ruled a man should die for the torture killings of a Lancaster woman and her three young daughters.

Jurors reached the verdict Tuesday in the case of Corey Lynn King, who was convicted last month of first-degree murder, torture and arson.

Prosecutors say 24-year-old King stabbed 43-year-old Sonya Durfield Harris and her 14-year-old daughter more than 50 times each in their home in 2008. 

Justice served: Corey Lynn King (left), 24, has been sentenced to death for the 2008 torture and murder of 43-year-old Sonya Durfield Harris (right) and her children 

He then stabbed, beat and stomped Harris' 11-year-old daughter and strangled her 9-year-old girl.

Prosecutors say the motive for killing Harris was unclear, but the girls were slain because they were witnesses.

After the killings, King doused the bodies and home with gasoline and set it on fire.

He is scheduled to be officially sentenced February 20 in the Antelope Valley courthouse. 

Corey Lynn King, then 18 years old, surrendered to police on September 10, 2008, a day after firefighters found the bodies of Sonya Durfield Harris and her three daughters, Ebony Horton, 13; Melina Harris, 11; and Kayla Clark, 9, in their burning home in Lancaster, a city about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.

The prosecution's complaint filed after King’s arrest charged him with four counts of murder with the special circumstances of multiple murders and torture of the woman and the 13-year-old, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said in a statement.

King, of nearby Altadena, was also charged with one count each of arson of an inhabited structure and grand theft auto.

Sheriff's officials have said King was a friend of the slain woman's 19-year-old son, who lives out of state. A family friend has said King was drinking at the home into the pre-dawn hours before the slayings.

In his opening statement in mid-November, Prosecutor Robert Sherwood described for the jury in graphic detail what went on inside Sonya Durfield Harris' home in 1500 block of East Avenue J-3 in Lancaster on the night of the bloody rampage, reported The Antelope Valley News.

The mother of three was stabbed 68 times, her throat was slit and her skull was fractured, while her 13-year-old daughter sustained over 60 stab wounds, including seven to her chest. 

Eleven-year-old Melinda was bashed in the head with a metal pot, and then stomped on the head with such force that a shoe imprint was left on her forehead, the prosecutor said in court. She child was also stabbed at least 12 times. 

Nine-year-old Kayla’s body was so severely burned that the medical examiner could not determine if she had been stabbed.

After the murders, King drove Durfield Harris’ car to a gas station and filled up several bottles with gasoline, prosecutors said.

He returned to the home and doused the victims with the gas before setting the entire house on fire.

At the time of the killings, King was on parole after pleading guilty in August to misdemeanor petty theft for stealing from a convenience store. The Sheriff's Department said he was in a program that involved working at the Altadena sheriff's station during the day and going home at night.

During King’s trial last month, jurors heard evidence about the May 2008 killing of 90-year-old Evelyn Mosely, whose body was found in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor of her fire-ravaged home in Altadena.

King was named a ‘person of interest’ in the slaying at the time, but he has never been charged with the woman’s death.
