How many people will be willing to say 'I volunteer' to being dropped in the wilderness and forced to fend for themselves while being watched on camera 24/7?

That's the premise around Survival Live, a Hunger Games-like new reality adventure series being produced by Discovery.

Set to premiere later this year, the show will strand eight contestants in a jungle-like environment for 42 days and force them to fend for themselves, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The program will air two episodes each week - one pre-recorded and one live - and viewers will be able to track the survivalist's progress on a 24/7 web platform.

Gamers ready: Survival Live, a new adventure series being made by Discovery, sounds like a reality spin-off of The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence (pictured). The show will strand eight people in the wilderness and film them 24/7 as they fend for themselves

Similar: Discovery also produce the series Naked and Afraid, in which one male and one female contestant are dropped in the jungle with no food, no water and no clothes

Like Big Brother - and in a new twist on the traditional format - contestants will be able to ask viewers for help.

Each person will have to build their own social network to help them through their ordeal by talking to the cameras in a video diary-like scenario, and their relationship with the audience will decide whether they stay or go.

The survivalist who proves the weakest will be eliminated during the live episode each week.

The show will be filmed somewhere in the Pacific Rim.

'It's a really fascinating opportunity to take one of our strongest genres, survival, and mash it up with a live environment, but also do it in a very social and digital way,' Eileen O'Neill, group president of Discovery and TLC Networks, told THR.

The network already has mounted live versions of multiple series, such as American Chopper.

O'Neill has made big-scale live stunts a priority at Discovery because they equal big ratings.

Austrian jumper Felix Baumgartner's leap from the stratosphere gave the network a record daytime audience of more than 4.2 million viewers, while Nik Wallenda's high-wire walk over the Grand Canyon was watched by more than 13 million viewers last summer.

According to Eileen O'Neill, group president of Discovery and TLC Networks, Survival Live will be filmed at an isolated location somewhere in the Pacific Rim and will premiere later this year

In May Discovery will present Everest Jump Live, during which free jumper Joby Ogwyn will climb Mount Everest and then leap from the summit in a custom-made wing-suit.

The success of unscripted adventure shows including Survivor, Amazing Race and Discovery's Naked and Afraid, in which one male and one female contestant are dropped in the jungle with no food, no water and no clothes.

But O'Neill notes that only experienced survivalists need apply for Survival Live.

'We have a lot of people who want to test their mettle on our survival shows,' she said.

'These are pretty rugged environments, so we do background checks and psych checks, and that reduces the pool to choose from pretty quickly.'
