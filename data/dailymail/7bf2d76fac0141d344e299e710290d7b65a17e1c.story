As Malaysia mourns the victims of flight MH370 - which included 38 Malaysians - the nation's queen was photographed enjoying a round of golf.

Her Majesty The Raja Agong Tuanku Hajah Haminah, The Queen of Malaysia, laughed heartily at Glenmarie Golf & Country Club in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday during a pro-am event prior to the EurAsia Cup.

The pictures emerged as search teams from several nations continued to scour the southern Indian Ocean for debris from the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines plane in a bid to bring the relatives of the passengers some closure.

New satellite images have revealed 122
 objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be debris from the 
Malaysian jetliner, missing since March 8 with 239 people on board, 
Malaysia's acting transport minister said on Wednesday.

The
 find has dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted
 across an area measuring just 155 square miles (400 square kilometres).

In
 the past few days the search area has measured around 622,000 square 
miles - six times the size of the UK. On Wednesday around 31,000 square 
miles was scoured.

Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defence and Space on March 23.

They are the fourth set of satellite 
images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a
 remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 2,500 km (1,550 miles) south 
west of Perth.

The objects are believed to be solid and range from one metre to 23 metres (three to 75 feet) long.

It
 is understood some pieces of debris are 'bright' but authorities have 
not confirmed whether they are from missing Malaysia Airlines flight 
MH370.

Anguish: Relatives of the passengers have been tortured by a lack of concrete information about the fate of MH370

Flight MH370 vanished
 from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from 
Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing, and investigators believe someone on the
 flight may have shut off the plane's communications systems.

Partial
 military radar tracking showed it turning west and recrossing the Malay
 Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

Malaysia's
 air force has released few details of its radar tracking beyond saying 
the plane was last detected off the northwest coast heading towards 
India.

But 
the country's deputy defence minister, Abdul Rahim Bakri, told 
parliament that no action was taken when the unidentified plane was 
spotted because it was assumed it had been ordered to turn back, local 
media said.

'It was detected by our radar, but the
 turn back was by a non-hostile plane and we thought maybe it was at the
 directive of the control tower,' he was quoted as saying.

Asked
 at the news conference whether air force radar operators thought the 
plane had been told to turn back by air traffic controllers, 
Hishammuddin, who is also defence minister, said he could not confirm 
it.

A dozen aircraft from 
Australia, the United States, New Zealand, China, Japan and South Korea 
were once more scouring the seas southwest of Perth in the hunt for 
wreckage on Wednesday, after bad weather the previous day forced the 
suspension of the search.

But the area is renowned among mariners for high winds and big waves and the good weather is unlikely to last.

‘This
 is only going to be a narrow window of opportunity by the looks of 
things, because another weather system is moving in for Thursday, which 
looks like that will bring an increase in winds again and also lead to a
 reduction in visibility through the rain associated with the cold 
front,’ Neil Bennett, a spokesman for Australia's Bureau of Meteorology,
 told Reuters.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak this week confirmed Flight MH370 had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.
