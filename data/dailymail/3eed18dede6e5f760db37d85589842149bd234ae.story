British teacher Lauren Patterson (pictured) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in Doha, Qatar, in 2013 - her killers then burnt her body

A lawyer attempting to overturn the death sentence of a man convicted of murdering British school teacher Lauren Patterson in Qatar has accused prison guards of torturing his client.

Lauren Patterson, 24, from Kent, was sexually assaulted and stabbed and her burnt remains were left in a remote desert location by a local 'casual acquaintance' in October 2013.

Badr Hashim Khamis Abdallah al-Jabar and his accomplice maintained Miss Patterson's death was accidental, but were found guilty of the brutal killing in March 2014.

Al-Jabr was sentenced to death and accomplice Mohamed Abdallah Hassan Abdul Aziz was jailed for three years for helping to dispose of Miss Patterson's body.

Both men were arrested after Miss Patterson's remains were found in a remote desert spot outside the Qatari capital city of Doha after she went missing following a night out.

The lawyer, who represents both men, said his clients  had been kept in solitary confinement for 40 days between interviews with prosecutors, and the abuse they suffered would have 'clouded anybody's judgement'.

The attorney did not elaborate on his torture claim, which was not raised in last year's criminal trial that ended in Al-Jabar being sentenced to death.

During yesterday's appeal hearing, the defence lawyer for the two men once again repeated the argument that Al-Jabar killed Miss Patterson in self-defence and attacked her moral character, calling her 'promiscuous,' an 'excessive drinker' and 'irrational'.

The defence lawyer has spent considerable time in previous hearings dwelling on Miss Patterson's drinking habits. 

During the 2014 trial Miss Patterson's friend Lea Monet testified how she, Miss Patterson and the two men, who she said they were 'casually acquainted with', had left a nightclub at La Cigale Hotel in Doha around 3.30am on October 12.

She said Miss Patterson, who had just returned from attending her grandmother's funeral in England, was not drunk and was 'aware of her surroundings'. 

During the trial the prosecution said the defendant took Miss Patterson to a place he used for sexual trysts with women, 'conquered her body', and killed her by stabbing her twice.

Following yesterday's hearing, Miss Patterson's mother, Alison, said she has seen 'nothing but genuine honesty, clarity and a need for the truth to prevail' on the part of prosecutors.

She also took exception to the 'attempted character assassination' of her daughter by the defence lawyer, saying he provided no evidence to back up his statements.

She said: 'Lauren was a hard-working girl who loved her job and spent most evenings of her time after work giving private tuition to pupils in their homes or studying to complete her degree.

'All of which can be corroborated, unlike the defence's story. 

'While he attacked my daughter's character, he forgot to mention that his clients regularly frequented bars and consumed alcohol.'

Mrs Patterson also said the defence lawyer did not address what the men are accused of doing to her daughter's body following her death.

She argued: 'If it was self-defence, why did the lawyer not mention them removing my daughter's body to the desert by car, purchasing coal and fuel and burning her body beyond recognition and then going back to the scene to make sure they had burnt her body? 

'If it was self-defence, would you do that?'

During yesterday's hearing, the lawyer for the Patterson family asked that their request for 20 million QR, £3.5million, in compensation from the convicted men be referred to a civil court. 

Financial settlements are a common feature in serious court cases in Qatar.

A final verdict is scheduled for March 23.
