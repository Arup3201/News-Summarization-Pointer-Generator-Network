Its quaint cottages, picturesque gardens and towering church spire have earned Painswick the title of ‘Queen of the Cotswolds’.

So it’s perhaps of little surprise that residents of the quiet village reacted with fury when a racy lingerie shop opened on their high street.

But in an unusual twist to the tale, it was revealed that the risqué boutique of underwear was part of the set for The Casual Vacancy, one of the BBC’s most anticipated dramas of 2015.

The cast of high-profile adaptation of JK Rowling’s bestselling book, have spoken of how the fake shop was branded a ‘disgrace’ but also how some sheepish residents came in to browse the aisles, only to be turned away by the film crew.

And Miss Marple star Julia McKenzie, 73, said the three-part series could be the last time fans see her on screen for several months, revealing she has had to turn down work after breaking her knee.

The 2012 novel from the Harry Potter author, 49, tells the story of the fictional village of Pagford. Its dark themes of drug addiction, sexual abuse and suicide saw it sell one million copies in its first three weeks.

But it was the lingerie store of character Samantha Mollison, played by Keeley Hawes, that drew the ire of Painswick residents when their village became the backdrop for the book’s twisting tale.

Speaking at a preview of the series, director Johnny Campbell revealed the locals’ anger at thinking a sex shop had opened in their quiet streets. Although, he also admitted the makeshift store did get some enquiring visitors.

He said: ‘They did mistake it for the real thing and complained about it at the local parish council meeting, they said it was a disgrace.

‘But there were a couple of occasions when we were filming and an old lady, white hair and a stick, was walking past looking in the window. We said, “Please excuse....”, she said, “Oh no, I’ve got all that stuff.”

‘Someone came in, they thought there was a sale on so we found people looking round at some of the stuff, it was amusing.’

Unlike the fictional Pagford, where drug addiction and murky local politics seem to be the norm, Painswick paints a very different picture.

Built largely of stone from a local quarry, it is one of the best preserved villages in the Cotswolds and sits in an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one of 38 such areas across England and Wales.

With a population of barely over 2,000 it is a quiet community but one that is full of history. Its parish church, which dates back nearly 1,000 years, gave refuge to the Roundheads during the English Civil War. There are reportedly 99 yew trees growing in the courtyard, with legend claiming the Devil refuses to let a one hundredth take root.

But even the charms of Painswick do not seem to be enough to lure Miss Marple star Julia McKenzie, who plays Shirley Mollison in The Casual Vacancy, back to rural life.

She quit the countryside for London some years ago and claimed at Monday’s screening to have no regrets at abandoning the small village lifestyle.

She said: ‘I lived in the Cotswolds for about 14 years, I lived in Burford which was actually one of the areas where we filmed. I can tell you there’s a lot of politics in village life.

‘In my particular village for instance, there were some very wealthy people who wanted to buy a new notice board. The arguments about whether it should have a front of glass or on this side or over that side - they gave up because they didn’t want to buy it any more. They don’t have anything else to do but keep an eye on other people. It’s very political on villages.’

Her turn in the series may be the last time she graces screens for several months following breaking her knee at the end of last year.

Speaking about the injury for the first time, she said: ‘I broke my knee cap, London streets are not paved with gold I’m afraid, they are pitfalls. I went straight over with an arm full of shopping in November.

‘I thought it would just get better, I thought it was just swollen and I’d be all right. But it wasn’t and I had actually fractured my knee cap.

‘For the last two months I’ve been in a leg brace with iron bits and good knows what, sitting with my foot up all the time. I can’t do with out my crutch at the moment, I’ve lost my confidence a bit.

‘I’m just about to start physio, I’m doing some gentle work now and then I’ll go into about three months of physio. I can’t bend it, it’s so sore.

‘I’ve had to turn down a couple of things which might have taken me into the year but it’s ok. Half the time I actually look for an excuse not to work these days.’

The first episode of The Casual Vacancy will broadcast on BBC1 on Sunday February 15 at 9pm.
