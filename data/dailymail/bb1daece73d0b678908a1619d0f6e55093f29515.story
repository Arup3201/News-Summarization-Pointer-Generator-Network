It looks more like a scene from Mad Max than a religious celebration, but revellers in the Greek town of Galaxidi marked the beginning of Lent yesterday with an almighty - and extremely messy - flour fight.

Hundreds of party-goers lined the old harbour of the pretty resort clutching bags of flour and colourful powder for Clean Monday, which is a national holiday in Greece.

The celebrations  mark the end of carnival season in the country and the beginning of Lent which ends on Easter Sunday.

In scenes reminiscent of post-apocalyptic film Mad Max, revellers in the Greek town of Galaxidi marked the beginning of lent yesterday with an almighty - and extremely messy - flour fight

Clean Monday, also know as Pure Monday or Ash Monday, is a national holiday throughout Greece

Also known as 'Pure Monday', the day is derived from passages in the Old Testament and is intended as a time to renounce sinful attitudes and behaviour.

Clean Monday celebrations are popular all over Greece, although the flour flight is unique to Galaxidi and is thought to have been influenced by similar celebrations in Sicily during the 19th century.

More traditional, and less messy, celebrations involve flying kites, eating fish and other fasting food, including a special type of bread - 'lagana' - which is baked especially on the day to make the occasion.

It is also customary to confess your sins and give your house a thorough clean.   

Consuming meat, eggs and dairy products is traditionally forbidden to Orthodox Christians throughout Lent, although from the look of these images, abstention was the last thing on these revellers minds.
