After a successful loan spell at Goodison Park last season, Gareth Barry completed his permanent move from Manchester City just in time to join the club's pre-season training camp in Austria.

And the midfielder appeared to have settled back in, as he and full-back Seamus Coleman joked together while braving an ice bath after the Blues' first session at Bad Erlach.

Roberto Martinez's squad touched down in Austria for a five-day training camp on Monday, with all the first-team players who were not involved at the World Cup joined by a group of youngsters from the academy.

Barry will be hoping to replicate the form he showed while on loan at Goodison Park last season, as Everton boss Martinez tries to push on from their fifth-place finish.

The 33-year-old, who penned a £55,000-a-week three-year deal, could play a key role in Everton's Europa League campaign having represented Manchester City in the Champions League in recent years.

He was released by City this summer and Everton moved quickly to snap up one of their star performers from last season.

Speaking to Evertontv, Barry said: 'I was really keen to get this sorted before the lads come back to training on Thursday. I'm delighted now that everything is signed and that I'm going to be spending the next few years at Everton.'

'When you are on loan, it is never the same as being a signed player. I was really settled last year - but now I am an official Everton player and it feels really good'.
