A GP accused of telling a patient he was an 'a*******' destined for a 'horrible death' will battle to save his practice before a tribunal next month.

Dr Richard Dunn faces allegations that his 'rude and abrupt manner' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated and, instead of simply telling tobacco addicts their options, he informed them they would die horribly if they didn't quit.

However the GP, who practices in West Kent, disputes the accusations and says that, even if he did use the word 'a*******', it was not a description of his patient but was meant as 'a basic description of a part of his anatomy'.

After a series of patient complaints about Dr Dunn's manner, West Kent Primary Care Trust is now trying to have him removed from its 'Performers' List' and the case is set to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal in February.

In a preliminary decision last month, tribunal judge, Melanie Lewis, said Dr Dunn stands accused of having a 'grossly unprofessional and unacceptable manner towards patients' as well as poor record keeping and failing to provide 'clinically appropriate' treatment in some cases.

The Primary Care Trust (PCT) launched an investigation after a 'significant number' of patients requesting a transfer from Dr Dunn's practice raised concerns about his conduct and the treatment he was providing.

Detailing some of the 'highlights' of the claims Dr Dunn faces, Judge Lewis added: 'A number of patients complained of no eye contact and/or rude and abrupt manner. Patients complained of Dr Dunn being bullying and intimidating when they felt too ill to defend themselves.

'There is also a specific example of Dr Dunn allegedly telling a patient that he was an 'a******' and was going to die a 'horrible death' and was a 'burden on him'.

'In relation to that particular allegation, which he (Dr Dunn) does not accept, he says that whilst he may have used that word, it was not a description of the patient but a basic description of a part of his anatomy'.

Another patient who complained of 'foul language', claimed Dr Dunn had told him: 'Now get out of my office, you're p****** me off and no doubt you p*** other people off as well'.

Judge Lewis added: 'We read other examples of where Dr Dunn hadn't simply given patients an explanation of the choices available to them if they continued to for example smoke, but allegedly told them that they would die a horrible death.'

Dr Dunn was temporarily suspended from the PCT's Performers' List in October 2010, but Judge Lewis refused to extend that and he has been back on the list, subject to an agreed regime of 'strict and intensive monitoring and supervision', since the December ruling.

In her decision, Judge Lewis said 'no adverse professional findings' had ever been made against Dr Dunn, who qualified in 1986 and is now in his mid-50s.

The judge made no findings on any of the allegations faced by Dr Dunn, none of which have been proved, and observed: 'Overall, our view is that whilst troubling, conduct and negative language to patients, are issues that are capable of being remedied.'

Despite claims that Dr Dunn's treatment of some patients was not 'clinically appropriate', she said it was 'not a case of glaring error or omission'.

And restoring his name to the Performers' List pending the full hearing of his case, Judge Lewis concluded the continued suspension of an experienced GP was neither necessary to protect the public nor otherwise in the public interest.

Dr Dunn's case has now been listed for a full hearing, expected to last at least five days, before the First Tier Tribunal in February.
