A super-spicy burger so hot it must be eaten wearing protective gloves has gone on sale - but only to over-18s who sign a disclaimer.

The mega-hot Atomic Fallout burger, which contains two of the world's hottest chillies, contains a sauce registering a volcanic 1million on the Scoville scale.

Chefs at Atomic Burger, Bristol, used two of the world's hottest chillies to create it, the Naga Bhut Jolokia, also known as the Ghost Chilli, and the Scotch Bonnet.

Scroll down for video of the challenge!

And the burger's size is almost as daunting as its spiciness, with the usual bun replaced by two deep fried pizza slices.

The Atomic Fallout also contains 18oz of minced beef as well as 18oz of cheese and is served up with a triple portion of chilli fries.

Atomic Burger owners Martin Bunce and James Reilly have challenged diners to finish the £25 mega-meal in under an hour as part of their unique Fallout Challenge.

Those who beat the burger win a special t-shirt and have their name mounted on the restaurant's 'Wall of Flame.'

Just one in ten of the 500 people who've taken the challenge have completed it so far, with Mr Bunce admitting he could only manage a quarter of the burger.

He added: 'We did a four-week special of the Fallout Challenge, but after
the special came to an end we had so many people asking to do it, it 
ended up becoming a permanent fixture on our menu.

'The sauce in the burger contains a variety of chillies including the 
Ghost Chilli and the Scotch Bonnet. But what gives the sauce a real kick
is the Ghost Chilli extract which registers at 4.2 million Scoville 
units.

'What makes our challenge different is it’s not just ridiculously hot but it’s big too.
'I’m quite a chilli head, I enjoy extreme heat but even I only managed about a quarter of the burger.'

Spicy food fan Jess James Farmer looked confident before attempting the burger

The messy aftermath of his attempt at the Atomic Fallout burger

Jess James Farmer, 23, attempted the Atomic Fallout on Sunday - but failed to finish it.

The hardy mechanical engineer called himself a 'big fan' of spicy food but admitted: 'I don't think I could brave it again.'

He added 'It’s definitely the hottest thing I’ve ever eaten and certainly not for the faint hearted.

'It’s a constant burn, the heat intensifies with every mouthful, each bite is like an inferno in your mouth.
'Even the chips are hot, covered in chilli flakes and spices but compared to the burger the chips are a relief.
'It is ridiculously hot but it’s still tasty, the heat doesn’t ruin the other flavours in the burger.
'A few of my friends tasted a tiny bit of the sauce and they just couldn’t believe how I was even eating it.'
