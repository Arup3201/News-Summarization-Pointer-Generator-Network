A Florida woman said she is going to be haunted by discovering the skull of a bird inside a bag of frozen spinach.

Madeline Brogan, of Sarasota, got the horrible shock when she was making food for New Year's Eve and opened the packet from Publix supermarket.

'When I was draining it, I ran into something hard and I didn't want to throw it down the garbage disposal,' Brogan told ABC 7. Then she realized what she had found.

Horror: Madeline Brogan found this bird's skull inside a bag of frozen spinach

Disturbing: Brogan said she was drained the vegetables when she 'ran into something hard'

Responsible: Brogan bought the offending vegetables from Publix supermarket in Sarasota

'I will probably need therapy because that little thing is going to haunt me,' Brogan laughed as she explained the disturbing incident to ABC.

'There's an eye missing out of it,' she said. 'I would expect a bug, or a natural part of something that grows on the ground, even a pebble or a stick, but not a bird.'

Understandably upset, Brogan took the bag of vegetables - and the skull - back to the Publix branch in Sarasota where she bought it.

At first, managers at the store offered her a full refund of $1.79. Then, on Thursday, a representative from Publix HQ visited Brogan to talk about her find.

Shock: 'I will probably need therapy because that little thing is going to haunt me,' Brogan laughed as she explained the disturbing incident

The Publix employee gave her a gift card, a basket of goods and several bags of Publix frozen fruits and vegetables, including more spinach.

Meanwhile, where the bird skull came from still remains a mystery and Publix are investigating the incident.

'We have not received any additional complaints and believe this an isolated incident,' the supermarket chain said in a statement.

Brogan told ABC that she wants to know about what happened to the rest of the bird's body, the other half of beak and its eye.
