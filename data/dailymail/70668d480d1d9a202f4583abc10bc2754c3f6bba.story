Heather Watson's run in the Californian desert ended  when she became distracted by a supposed injury to her opponent Carla Suarez Navarro.

The British No 1 went down 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 to the experienced Spaniard in the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

Watson looked in command in the first set when the world No 13 turned an ankle and called on the trainer for extensive treatment.

Suarez Navarro was troubled with an ankle injury throughout and it appeared to affect the British No 1

Yet, as is so often the case in tennis, the unaffected player seemed to be put off by what was going on with her opponent.

From 5-3 up she lost the next three games and then went down in the tiebreak as the Spaniard recovered quickly from whatever discomfort she was suffering.

After getting level the decider turned when Watson lost the fourth game from 40-0 up and she became disheartened after that as the heat took its toll.

However the points garnered from this week and an attacking form of tennis will embed Watson in the top 50 and put her close to the 40 mark.

Andy Murray takes on unseeded Frenchman Adrian Mannarino on Wednesday in his bid to make the last eight of the men's event.
