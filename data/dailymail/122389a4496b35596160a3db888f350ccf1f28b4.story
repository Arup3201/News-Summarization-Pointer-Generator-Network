A rusty old Jaguar left to rot in a barn for 30 years has sold at auction for nearly £110,000 - more than three times its estimate.

The Jaguar E-Type is one of the most iconic cars in history and also regarded as one of the most beautiful.

But this 1961 Flat Floor Roadster model - which is the 59th ever built - is in need of a full restoration after suffering so much neglect.

The owner, a retired naval architect in his 80s from Bath, Somerset, decided to sell it at this week's Bonhams' auction in Hendon, north-west London.

Two Bonham employees put the 1961 Jaguar E-Type 'Flat Floor' into place in preparation for yesterday's car auction at the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London

Due to spiralling running costs, the former owner stored the E-Type Jaguar in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since, gathering dust

Experts offered the battered vehicle 
with an estimate of just £30,000 - but they were stunned when the 
English sports car eventually sold for a staggering £109,000.

A spokesman said: 'We were delighted with the performance of this "barn find", which more than tripled its highest pre-sale estimate, boosting the auction to a strong £1.7million result.

'We had suspected it would do well, given that it is one of the earliest surviving right-hand drive roadsters - dating from the first few weeks of production - and the market's ongoing enthusiasm for original, unrestored "project" cars.'

The car was bought from an Exeter dealer by its most recent owner in 1965.

He then drove it regularly for around 18 years before hiding it away in the lock-up in Bath where it remained until being unearthed by Bonhams.

It was one of a number of classic cars which were sold yesterday at the RAF Museum in Hendon.

Covered in cobwebs: The original red leather interior will need to be carefully cleaned and restored to its former glory

Under the bonnet of the Jaguar E-Type is the car's original 3.8-litre engine. The car has not been in use since 1983

The car's new owner, who has remained anonymous, will now have to spend in excess of £50,000 returning the Jaguar to its former glory.

Enzo Ferrari once described the Jaguar E-Type as the most beautiful car ever made.

Under the bonnet of the Jaguar E-Type - which has done 65,000 miles in its 52-year history - is the car's original 3.8-litre engine.

When it is fully reconditioned, the convertible should be capable of a top speed of around 150mph.

Some 70,000 of the classic British cars were built but this is one of only a handful of originals still around.

But due to spiralling running costs, the former owner stored it in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since.

Its cream panels and chrome bumpers became spattered in rust over the last three decades and its red 
leather interior filled with dust.

Experts say it will take at least £50,000 to restore the tatty sports car to its former glory.

Jon Polson, motor car specialist at 
auctioneers Bonhams which sold the Jaguar, said: 'It's an 
incredible car - very rare and very desirable.

'It's the E-Type at its purest before 
changes had to be made to the model to adhere to safety laws. It is the 
59th ever built, and there are only a handful of the original models 
remaining.

'It would have been the owner's pride 
and joy when he bought it in 1965. Sadly the rising running costs forced
him to garage the car in 1983 and it has not been used since.'

The sale of the E-Type has once again showcased the strong classic car market.

On Saturday, a rotten Jaguar XK120 sold for £96,000 at auction - £80,000 more than the initial estimate.
