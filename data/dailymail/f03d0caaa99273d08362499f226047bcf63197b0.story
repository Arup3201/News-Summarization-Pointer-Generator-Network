Peter Lloyd married a woman from Thailand despite not divorcing his first wife

A bigamist who has been married four times has been spared jail after a judge heard pleas from his children describing him as an honest man.

Peter Lloyd, 53, from Twyford, Berkshire, wed his Thai bride, Malee Mahamatyachit, in 2000 before divorcing his first wife and mother of his children three years later.

While still married to Malee he went on to marry Lizette and his current wife Georgetta. He eventually divorced Malee in August last year.

However, Judge Zoe Smith gave him a six month prison sentence suspended for 12 months when she read statements from his children.

Lloyd married his first wife Karen in 1985 and the couple went on to have three children. Their relationship hit the rocks in the late nineties and Lloyd started travelling frequently to Thailand where he met Malee.

It was during one of his trips to the South East Asian country that he married Malee in 2000, but he did not divorce Karen until 2003.

Malee was given indefinite leave to remain in the UK but recent investigations by immigration officials going back to 2006 uncovered Lloyd's bigamy.

Adrian Eissa, defending Lloyd, said: 'He was going through what might be described as a mid-life crisis. The grass was not greener on the other side of the fence.

'He suspected she was seeing someone else. The upshot was she went back to Thailand for a while. He bought her a house in Thailand and still maintained a relationship with her, albeit he then moved on to a relationship with another lady, Lizette Giogu.'

Lloyd and Malee finally conceded that their relationship was over in 2008 but he did not divorce her until August 2012 and at some point during their marriage he also wed a woman called Lizette.

In 2010 he married Georgetta and the couple are still together, living in a house in Twyford, Berkshire. They also support her elderly parents in Romania.

When he was questioned about the bigamy allegations at Christmas 2011, he refused to answer questions. His lawyer said this was because 'he doesn't see it as all his fault', but added 'he does accept he has done wrong.'

The court also heard Lloyd lost £500,000 after getting involved in a Ponzi investment scheme and had a £2,000-a-month mortgage despite earning just £240 a week.

Addressing Judge Smith, Mr Eissa said: 'Your Honour can see something of
the character of the man in what he has done since all this turmoil in 
his life.

'Rather than throw his his hands up in despair at losing half-a-million 
pounds through a dishonest fraudster, he has got involved in a small 
company selling ceiling fans.'

The court heard references from Lloyd's three children, pleading for their father not to be sent to jail.Final year student Rebekah, 22, said: 'All he ever wanted was the best 
for me and my siblings and he worked hard to financially provide for us.

She added: 'I would not be who I am without my father. He has taught me to be kind and honest.'

Pleas from Lloyd's other children -19-year-old medical science student 
Naomi and 14-year-old schoolboy Samuel - were also submitted to the 
court.
