Two young brothers who could steal cars to order in just 20 seconds were jailed for taking 12 BMWs worth £250,000 after police caught them operating astonishingly quickly in a car park on CCTV.

Brothers Ravinder, 22, and Ajay Soni, 20, both of Harborne, Birmingham, stole the luxury motors and an Audi Q7 over a 20-day period from West Midlands car parks in January and February last year.

CCTV footage released by West Midlands Police showed them stealing a BMW 118D from a hotel car park in Ladywood, Birmingham, in seconds by smashing windows to gain entry before driving away.

However, the car was fitted with a 
hidden tracking device which led police to a lock-up garage on an 
industrial estate where it was recovered with forensic evidence 
implicating the brothers.

Detectives
also traced gloves and tools from the unit to a Halfords store where 
they found CCTV footage showing Ajay Soni paying for the items.

West
Midlands Police investigating officer Detective Constable Matt Dyer, 
said: ‘This was an organised, sophisticated operation with high 
performance cars being stolen in less than 60 seconds.

‘Their
method of entry was somewhat rudimentary but once inside they clearly 
demonstrated technical skill to start the engine very quickly.

‘Ali
was considered the brothers' main handler - he created a market for 
them to get rid of the vehicles and on occasions identified particular 
vehicles he was interested in.'

The Soni brothers were both found guilty of conspiracy to steal motor vehicles and jailed for four years at Birmingham Crown Court.

Accomplice Amar Ali, 22, of Moseley, Birmingham, admitted handling stolen goods and was jailed for 27 months.

DC Dyer added: ‘Our investigation led us to recover all but one of the cars they stole.

‘We compiled compelling evidence against all three, including Automatic Number Plate Recognition hits, CCTV footage, DNA found on gloves, tools and car interiors, and mobile phone analysis which revealed conversations between them about "orders" for stolen cars.’

The West Midlands has been a recent hotspot for BMW thefts with 314 stolen in the first half of 2012, compared to 258 in the whole of 2011.
