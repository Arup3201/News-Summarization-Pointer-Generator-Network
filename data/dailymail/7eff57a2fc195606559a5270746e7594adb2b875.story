A school bus driver in Massachusetts was punched in the face when a confrontation broke out with parents who claim the driver wouldn't let their kids off the bus.

In a video of the tense confrontation reported by MassLive, the adults are heard cursing at the driver and demanding their children be let off at a bus stop in Worcester.

Children from the Quinsigamond Elementary School are heard screaming and shouting while the bus sits at the stop with its windows rolled up on Wednesday.

'It's hot in here,' one kids screams.

Angry parents in Massachusetts confront a bus driver who they say wouldn't let their kids off a sweltering bus

A few minutes in, the bus begins to move — and parents become even angrier.

'Oh, my god, don't leave with my kid,' shouts parent Jessica Jimenez, who shared the video with MassLive. 'Don't leave with my kid.'

Some parents blocked the bus while others told children to leave through the emergency exit, according to MassLive.

One of the parents broke the front door of the bus and a 16-year-old girl walked in to pick up her sister.

'They broke the window. I went in to try and get my little sister and the lady said it was kidnapping or whatever and she pushed me, so I punched her,' Igdala Lebron told WCVB.

The kids eventually hopped off the bus through the back, crying while the bus alarm blared.

'To see my two children trapped that way, helpless as I felt, was terrifying,' Nicole Prizio, whose 8- and 10-year-old children were on the bus, told MassLive.

School officials say the driver was simply following security protocols — but the parents jumped the gun.

'Some of the adults were impatient and just wanted the students released,' schools Superintendent Melinda Boone told the Worcester Telegram and Gazette.  'Some attempted to board the bus to take the students, at which point the driver closed the door with the idea of stabilizing the situation.'

The driver told parents that adults are not allowed on the bus with students on board — and when the parents refused to leave, a supervisor told the driver via radio to close the door, the school said.

'Parents broke the door and entered the school bus,' the school said. 'The school bus driver was also physically assaulted, struck at least two times in the face.'

The 16-year-old girl who allegedly punched the driver will be summonsed for assault and battery, according to the school officials.

Police are still investigating the incident.

'We felt like, you know, she was holding them hostage,' parent Marilyn Poske told CBS Boston.

Dad Luis Rivera says the driver was just doing her job.

'She has a protocol that she has to let off the kindergarten kids first, and then the bigger kids get off,' Rivera told CBS Boston. 'She wasn’t going to let any kids out until the parents at least calmed down so she could do her job and they weren’t allowing her to do that.'
