Looking tired and dejected, England's rugby team finally appeared to be taking things seriously as they arrived back in Britain today.

After being dumped out of the Rugby World Cup by France at the weekend, England had looked in high spirits as they boarded a plane home from New Zealand.

But their demeanour as they touched down at Heathrow Airport this afternoon was more suitable for a side that had delivered poor performances on the field and poor behaviour off it.

Mike Tindall and team-mate Manu 
Tuilagi looked like players preparing to face the music as they exited 
an airport side-door - in sharp contrast to their high jinx at Auckland 
airport yesterday.

There, Tuilagi kissed his team 
captain’s head in what was believed to be a reference to Tindall's 
encounter – captured on a nightclub’s CCTV – with old friend Jessica 
Palmer. Tindall, of course, is newly married to Zara Phillips, the 
Queen’s grand-daughter.

Not that Tuilagi had any reason to be 
playing the jester. Hours earlier he had been held by police after 
jumping from the deck of a ferry - the final embarrassment of the trip.

The 20-year-old, who came close to 
being deported from Britain last year for overstaying his visa, was held
in Auckland after he jumped from a ferry as it was about to berth and 
swam ashore, apparently egged on by other players.

His antics came after England were 
knocked out of the World Cup by France at the quarter-final stage and at
the end of a team visit to Waiheke Island, which lies 35 minutes by 
ferry from Auckland, during which the players and management toured 
vineyards.

It was the latest controversial 
incident to involve an England player during the team's ill-fated 
campaign which has seen Tindall caught on CCTV kissing a blonde in a 
Queenstown nightclub.

Three other players – Chris Ashton, 
James Haskell and Dylan Hartley – were reprimanded for their actions 
involving a female member of staff in the team hotel in a separate 
incident.

Other incidents include the suspension
of two players for dangerous play, the suspension of two coaches over 
ball-switching against Romania and the fining of Tuilagi for wearing a 
gumshield with unauthorised advertising.

Tuilagi - considered by many as 
England's best player during the tournament - jumped from the catamaran 
ferry, Superflyte, as it prepared to berth at the Auckland waterfront 
with the defeated England team on board.

The Samoan-born player swam a short 
distance to Pier 3 and while there were shouts of encouragement from 
many passengers on the ferry, the police were not amused and Tuilagi was
taken to Auckland Central police station.

He could have been charged with disorderly conduct, but was given a warning and allowed to return to the team hotel.

Tuilagi was later seen with other players out at a bar until the small hours.

Passionate: Tuilagi, centre, with arm across his chest, sings the national anthem with other members of the England team ahead of the quarter-final with France, which England lost

Kick in the teeth: Tuilagi was also fined for wearing this gumshield displaying unauthorised sponsorship

He was fined £3,000 by the Rugby 
Football Union. England manager Martin Johnson said: ‘This was an 
irresponsible thing to do. Manu has been disciplined internally and I 
have warned him about his future conduct.’

Angry officials of the company that operates the ferry said the incident was ‘extremely dangerous’.

Spokesman Warren Fowler said: ‘The ferry had made a turn and was about to reverse to its berth when this happened.

‘It could have been tragic with 
vessels coming in here and someone jumping off the back of a vessel when
it is going to be reversing shortly.
