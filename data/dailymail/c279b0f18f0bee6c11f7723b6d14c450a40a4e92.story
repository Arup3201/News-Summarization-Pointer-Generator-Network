Missing: Mateusz Wiliamowski, 16, from Poland, has been staying with relatives in Perth since May

This is the missing 16-year-old boy swept away by water as he waded through a Scottish river.

Police frantically searching the River Tay in Perth for the teenager today named him as Mateusz Wiliamowski, a Polish boy who has been staying with relatives in the city since May.

His friends alerted police after Mateusz vanished while wading through the water at North Muirton at around 7.20pm last night.

A 30-strong rescue team has been scouring the area, but the search has so far yielded no trace of the teenager.

'Around 30 people are involved in the physical search of the river, starting from where the missing teenager was last seen in the North Muirton area and heading downstream,' a police spokesman said today.

'Searches will be undertaken along the river bank and around the islands and personnel will also be taking to boats to assist the river search.'

He added that the boy's family are 'distraught'.

Relatives in Perth and Poland are being kept informed of developments.

Elsewhere in Scotland a search was underway at a rain-swollen burn in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, following reports that a 10-year-old girl had fallen into the water last night.

Officers said there had been no reports of a missing girl in the area or across neighbouring police divisions, and that door-to-door inquiries were carried out in the Lynn Drive area of the town near the burn.

The search continued today but no trace of anyone has been found.

A force spokeswoman said: 'A full search of the water and the banks has taken place with officers using specialist equipment, including heat-seeking equipment and trained police dogs and no trace of anyone has been found.'

A helicopter was dispatched to the River Tay last night when police were called after Mateusz got into difficulty while crossing the river.

The hunt revealed no trace of the boy.

Also last night, a full-scale operation was launched at the River Garnock in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire at around 8.30pm amid reports of a girl, said to be aged 10, being swept away by the water.

It was said the girl may have stumbled on the grass-bank while walking in Kilbirnie and fallen into the water.

Police had said details were 'sketchy' and that they had received no reports of a missing child in the area.
