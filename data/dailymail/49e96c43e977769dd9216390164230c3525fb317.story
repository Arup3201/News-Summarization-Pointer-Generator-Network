Jahangir Nazar is alleged to have been jealous, controlling and possessive - and resentful of his wife, Farkhanda Younis (pictured), having 'many boyfriends'.

A 'jealous' husband who stabbed his 'flirtatious' bride to death threatened to kill her a month before, a court heard.

Farkhanda Younis, 30, had once been 'head over heels' in love with Jahangir Nazar, 35, but suffered regular violence at his hands, it is alleged.

Nazar is alleged to have been jealous, controlling and possessive - and resentful of his 'flirtatious and attractive' wife having 'many boyfriends'.

On the night Ms Younis died she had met a previous partner for a lovers' tryst. The prosecution in Nazar's murder trial in Manchester say he believed by marrying her he could secure his stay in Britain.

Ms Younis, 30, who was known as 'Jabeen', was found stabbed to death at her home at Bamford Street, Chadderton on April 19 after her young son from a previous relationship called 999.

Nazar has admitted manslaughter, but denies murder, saying he was mentally ill at the time.

Carla Cutting, a friend of Ms Younis, told the court in a statement she learnt Nazar had killed her from an overheard conversation, three days after it happened.

‘Jabeen was always talking about (Nazar) and showing pictures of him. She was very proud of him and at first seemed head over heels - but their relationship was very stormy. She was talking about splitting up with him but then they would be back together’, Ms Cutting said.

‘The last time I spoke to Jabeen was on Facebook two days before her death. She said she could not talk because 'you know who' (Nazar) was present. I can remember one occasion about a month before Jabeen's death, when I was present when she was speaking to Nazar on her mobile phone.

‘The phone was on loudspeaker so I could hear both sides of the conversation, I could hear them arguing - I heard him threaten to give her a slap and then say: 'I will kill you.' At the time I just thought this had been said in anger, in the heat of the moment, rather than a genuine threat’, she said.

Another friend, Abdul Majeed, told Manchester Crown Court he saw Nazar 'hit Jabeen in the face very hard' when he believed she was lying to him about where she had been. Mr Majeed said he and Ms Younis took their children to the same primary school, telling court ‘I have seen her on many occasions with black eyes, every other week or two.'

Mr Majeed told court that Ms Younis had told him she was going to leave Nazar and had 'got police involved.'

Asked how often he believed she suffered violence from Nazar, Mr Majeed said: ‘It started to become something that was normal in her life.’

Yesterday the court heard Nazar, after stabbing his wife 19 times in the neck, had left Ms Younis’s body in her locked bedroom until her young son called police after failing to rouse her, a jury was told today.

Ms Younis was said to have lived ‘an entirely Westernised lifestyle’, the court heard, to the anger of her ‘possessive, controlling’ husband.

Hours before her death, she met up 
with another man, who was also married, and had sex to ‘celebrate his 
birthday’, Manchester Crown Court was told.

In
 that time, Nazar tried to call her 25 times, but none of the calls was 
answered, and he was allegedly ‘lying in wait for her’ when she got 
home.

The
takeaway delivery driver, who wed Miss Younis in an Islamic ceremony in 
2012 but was not her husband in the eyes of the law, has admitted 
manslaughter but denies murder, claiming his responsibility was 
diminished by mental illness.

However
 the prosecution say the behaviour after the killing, when he allegedly 
withdrew money, disposed of blood-soaked clothing and filled up his car,
 shows a ‘mental agility’ inconsistent with his account.

John
 Jones QC, opening the case for the prosecution, described Nazar as a 
possessive, controlling and violent partner who set up a mobile phone as
 a ‘listening device’ to check up on her when he was out.

Nazar
 was facing deportation and believed that marrying Miss Younis in a 
civil ceremony would secure his stay in Britain, he added.

‘It’s
 clear that Jabeen and the defendant had entirely different attitudes to
 life - it’s clear from others who witnessed the couple that the 
defendant was very possessive and very controlling of Jabeen,’ he said.

‘She was far more Westernised, outgoing and one has to say, promiscuous in the conduct of her life, if what other witnesses say about her is correct.

‘That is not said in a critical way - Jabeen was entitled to behave in a way she chose, this is not a court of morals or a judgement on her lifestyle.

‘But, the fact remains that Jabeen lived in every sense an entirely Westernised lifestyle.

‘She went to nightclubs, she had many boyfriends, she drank alcohol and she wore Westernised designer clothing. It’s clear she was a very attractive and flirtatious woman.

Farkhanda 'Jabeen' Younis was allegedly stabbed 19 times in a ferocious attack after she had 'birthday sex' with another man, Manchester Crown Court heard

‘Nazar resented it and sought to control it, and on the night in question, it led to uncontrollable rage.’ The court heard Nazar stabbed her 19 times in the neck in a ‘ferocious’ attack at her home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of April 19 last year.

Her body was found after her young son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang 999 because he couldn’t rouse her and her bedroom door was locked.

Mr Jones described it as ‘a significant attack by a man fearful of deportation, jealous of other men, and resentful of the promiscuity of his girlfriend’.

The trial continues.
