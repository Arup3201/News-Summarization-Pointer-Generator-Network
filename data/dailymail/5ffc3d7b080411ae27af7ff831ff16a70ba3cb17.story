Russian military intelligence is testing out a new spy recruit - Agent Squeak.  

Not as glamorous as flame-haired foreign intelligence agent Anna Chapman, mice are nevertheless seen as fast and versatile in underground operations, say experts.

They are potentially superior to dogs in detecting explosives and ammunition as well as seeking out human hostages, it is claimed. 

Military mouse: Russian intelligence say mice could be better than dogs at detecting explosives

Sources in Moscow say mice have been used already by the Israeli military in counter terrorist situations.  

If they pass a series of exacting tests at a secret location, the creatures could be deployed not only by GRU military intelligence but also other Russian secret services better known for honeytraps than mousetraps, reported Izvestia newspaper.

'Mice can be taught to detect the smell of certain substances,' explained Russian expert Anton Venediktov.  

'Feeling it, they run to a special place in their cage, and make a certain pose.  

Russia's Anna Chapman captured the world's attention when she was deported from the U.s. accused of being a spy

'Mice can be trained to signal, in particular, the smell of weapons, explosives, drugs, or the human body.'

Mice - like Tom’s sparring partner Jerry and also Mickey Mouse - have been eulogised for years in cartoons, often portrayed as shrewder than other animals.  

This is with good reason, said Venediktov, from specialist technical and security centre EVRAAS in Moscow.  

They have a 'less complicated central nervous system' than some other animals.

This means they are not so prone to mood swings and emotional stress.   

Their behaviour is 'more stable', making them ideal for 007-style roles, it is claimed.  

They can be trained to perform 150 tasks in one month such as sniffing out explosives or weapons, and can work shifts of between six and eight hours, it is claimed.
