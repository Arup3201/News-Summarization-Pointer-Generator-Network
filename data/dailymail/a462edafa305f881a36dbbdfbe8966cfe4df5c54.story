Senator Jay Rockefeller said he was 'concerned' that phone-hacking may have extended to 9/11 victims or other Americans

The News Corp crisis went global today as a Senator called for a U.S. hacking probe and their Australian boss ordered a review of all editorial spending.

It emerged today that News International executives have met to discuss selling off their remaining three remaining titles The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.

But there are no obvious buyers for the papers - and the executives agreed to revisit the issue in six months time, the Wall Street Journal revealed.

Today News Corp's Australian branch announced they would investigate all payments they had made for stories over the last three years as the scandal spread.

In America, Senator John Rockefeller last night called for a probe into whether the company had been trying to access voicemails in America and he suggested 9/11 victims could have been targeted.

The 74-year-old politician said the 
closure of the News of the World raised 'serious questions' about 
whether the newspaper's parent company had broken U.S. law.

'I am concerned that the admitted phone hacking in London by the News 
Corp may have extended to 9/11 victims or other Americans,' he said.  'If they did, the consequences will be severe.'

However, the Senator, chairman of the committee on commerce, science and transportation, did not provide any specific evidence to back up his claims.

News Corp is based in New York, and owns the Wall Street Journal, New 
York Post, and Fox Broadcasting.

Les Hinton, the chief executive of 
Dow Jones and one of Mr Murdoch's most trusted aides jetted into London 
yesterday as the phone hacking fallout continues.

He was at the tycoon's Mayfair home yesterday along with Elisabeth Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks.

Today the boss of News Corp's Australian division, John Hartigan, said all editorial payments made over the last three years will be investigated.

News Limited own eight of the 12 major papers in Australia including the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph and The Australian.

Mr Hartigan, chairman and chief executive of subsidiary company News Limited, said in an email to staff it was 'offensive' to link them to the News of the World scandal.

He said there was 'absolutely no reason' to believe they were involved in any wrongdoing.

'We will be conducting a thorough review of all editorial expenditure over the past three years to confirm that payments to contributors and other third parties were for legitimate services,' he said.

'Policies, codes and guidelines are important. But what matters is conduct.

'I
have absolutely no reason to suspect any wrongdoing at News Limited. 
However, I believe it is essential that we can all have absolute 
confidence that ethical work practices are a fundamental requirement of 
employment at News Limited.'

He added in the email that a television station had apologised for incorrectly reporting that News Limited executives were suspected of involvement in the News of the World phone hacking.

Yesterday
News Corporation announced a £3billion plan to buy back hundreds of 
millions of shares, which have fallen sharply in value amid the 
escalating crisis at his British newspaper division.

More
than £4.3billion has been wiped off the value of the company since last
week due to fears that fallout from the phone-hacking investigation at 
News International will infect other parts of Mr Murdoch’s business.

News
of the buy-back provided a temporary prop for the sagging News Corp 
share price, which rose for the first time in five days.

But
the ploy is unlikely to placate shareholders, who have become 
increasingly alarmed at Mr Murdoch’s lax stewardship of the company, in 
the longer term.

Ministers are also understood to be 
desperate to find a way to block his bid while trying not to offend the 
powerful tycoon.

His
business has also been hit by a class action lawsuit by News Corps 
shareholders over claims bosses failed to properly investigate phone 
hacking taking place at the News of the World, which was shut down on 
Sunday.

However, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt's move
to delay the Sky bid on Monday afternoon could potentially salvage the 
deal, which had looked on the brink of collapse in the morning, 
according to City analysts.

Speculation
is mounting that the tycoon may have to relinquish day-to-day control 
of the company in a bid to draw a line under the crisis – and his son 
James, who runs all of News Corp’s businesses outside the US, could also
come under pressure to stand down as chairman of satellite giant BSkyB.

The past week has severely damaged 
News Corp’s bid to gain full control of Sky, and may see the media giant
forced to sell off part of its stake in the satellite firm.

If it fails Ofcom’s ‘fit and proper’ test, the media regulator could 
order News Corp to reduce its slice from 39 per cent to 29 per cent.

City sources said James Murdoch’s handling of the crisis has all but shattered his hopes of succeeding his father.

Analysts also said it frees Mr Hunt from a politically explosive conundrum.

If
he had blocked the deal, or called in the Competition Commission 
himself, he could have faced a legal challenge from News Corp. 

But if he had waved the takeover through, he risked triggering a wave of public fury.

Jeremy Hunt, right, was left with no choice to refer the case to the Competition Commission following the decision, and ends Ed Miliband's threat to call for a vote of confidence if the Government did not call time on the takeover

The investigation will take at least six months.

Senior
Lib Dem MP Don Foster, the party’s former culture spokesman, described 
the move as a ‘ruse’ designed to buy ‘breathing space’.

He added: ‘This is the best Murdoch can do to keep the possibility of the merger on the table. 

‘By
dropping the News of the World, he can say his involvement in news and 
current affairs in Britain has actually diminished and argue that the 
issue of media plurality has disappeared.

‘There
is nothing to prevent Ofcom, however, from investigating whether or not
the Murdoch empire is fit and proper to own even the 39 per cent of 
BSkyB it already owns.’

Mark Kelly, at stockbroker Olivetree 
Securities, said: ‘News Corp is smoothing the way for the Government 
here – keeping friends in power by making the decision for them.’

Louise
Cooper, of City broking firm BGC Partners, said Murdoch had given Hunt 
‘some wriggle room’ and avoided a ‘potentially damaging’ confidence vote
in the House of Commons tomorrow.

Labour leader Ed Miliband had threatened to force a vote if the Government did not call time on the proposed takeover.

Preventing
a parliamentary debate where fresh attacks could have been levelled 
against his papers was a ‘smart move by an operator who is rapidly 
taking back control of the situation’, she added.

However,
the chances of News Corp buying the 61 per cent of Sky it does not 
already own have tumbled with each new startling revelation.

Sky
shares plunged 5 per cent yesterday and a staggering £2.4billion has 
been wiped off the value of the satellite giant over the past week.

Alex DeGroote, at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the likelihood of the deal going ahead had reduced. 

Hugh Grant now provides Britain’s moral compass following the outbreak, a comedian joked on the Daily Show in the U.S. last night.

Jon Stewart, pictured left, pretended to vomit as correspondent John Oliver, right, explained the News of the World had hacked into Milly Dowler’s phone and deleted answerphone messages.

Oliver joked that after Notting Hill star Hugh Grant was now the most honourable man in Britain after he helped expose the scandal.

‘The guy who got car head from an LA road prostitute is now the moral compass of my nation,’ he said.

Presenter Jon Stewart was incredulous in the clip as he was told that police had been paid by journalists – and disgraced editor Andy Coulson had been employed by David Cameron.

He said: ‘On Friday we cut our probability of the deal going ahead to 
50:50 from 90:10 in favour. This seems very optimistic now. Our new 
assessment is 10:90 in favour. In other words, we believe the deal is 
all but dead.’

He also 
raised the possibility of a forced divestiture – sale, liquidation or 
spin off – of News Corp’s 39 per cent shareholding in BSkyB.

He added: ‘If the “fit and proper” test is applied rigidly by Ofcom and events elsewhere worsen, it could become a factor.’

It
is now alleged that as many as 4,000 people had their phones hacked by 
private investigators working for the News Of The World.

Speculation
grew today that the red top would be replaced by The Sun On Sunday 
after the domain name was transferred to News International from the 
company who bought it last week.

In
a further development this afternoon MPs will vote on a Labour motion 
urging News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch to withdraw his bid to take 
over the whole of BSkyB.

Tomorrow's
motion tabled by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who today met the family of
murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, states that 'this House believes that
it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to
withdraw their bid for BSkyB'.

News
International also said today it would co-operate after Rebekah Brooks,
Rupert Murdoch and his son James were asked to appear before a 
committee of MPs.

The 
Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee asked the trio to give evidence
about the phone hacking and police payments scandals at a hearing next 
week.

A spokeswoman for 
News International, publisher of the News of the World, the Sun, the 
Times and the Sunday Times, could not confirm whether all three would 
attend the hearing.

But the
company said in a statement: 'We have been made aware of the request 
from the CMS committee to interview senior executives and will 
co-operate. We await the formal invitation.
