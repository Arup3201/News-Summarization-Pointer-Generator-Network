Desevered: Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby described Conti as a 'really outstanding football official'

'She is not there because she is a female. She is there because she's paid her dues and because she is a really outstanding football official,' Bowlsby said on the decision.

'This is a good opportunity for her and a good opportunity for us, and I don't think you'll really notice much about how the officiating is done on the game. But it's significant that she's doing it.'

The Californian referee has been officiating games for 14 years after working high school matches in the FCS-level Southland Conference, as well as in the Mountain West this season.

Potty mouth: Kansas coach Charlie Weis says he'll mind his language when Conti officiates his match

After being announced as an official for September's Big 12 clash, Conti revealed her ambition is to impress and make the step up to the NFL one day.

'That's the ultimate dream,' she told USA TODAY Sports. 'But if this Big 12 game is the highest I ever get, it's certainly been a great career.'

'They've allowed me to develop. I've never walked on a football field and felt I was over my head.'

The appointment of a female as a Big 12 official has so far received positive feedback, with Kansas coach Charlie Weis also giving his support to the decision, believing it's a step forward to providing greater equality in a male-orientated sport.

'I'll try to watch my language. I believe in the old-fashioned way, so I'll try not to use as many bad words. But it means nothing to me,' the 58-year-old said.

'It's great that a woman is put in a position where whey can be put on equal footing with the men, and if I said other than that, I'd be in trouble with my wife. So more power to her.'

Despite her ground-breaking appointment, Conti is not the first woman to officiate an NCAA football game after Sarah Thomas took was involved in Memphis' 35-14 win over Jacksonville State in 2007.

The Mississippian hopes to become the first woman to officiate in the NFL this year after having spent time in the governing body's development program recently.
