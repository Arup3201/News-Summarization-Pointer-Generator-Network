Frantic: Jake Harris, 21, stabbed himself to death with a broken wine glass in a 'frantic attempt' to stop the effects of a former legal high, an inquest heard

A father-to-be stabbed himself to death with a broken wine glass in a ‘frantic attempt’ to stop the effects of a potent former legal high, an inquest heard.

Jake Harris, 21, became agitated after taking the ‘N-Bomb’ drug before throwing himself at a window.

He then smashed a glass and stabbed himself repeatedly in the neck at a party in Salford, Manchester.

A coroner has now issued a warning over the illegal drug, which is a powerful hallucinogen similar to LSD.

An inquest into the death of Mr Harris, a lifeguard from Rochdale, heard the drug was behind the deaths of two young men in Australia - one who jumped out of a window and another who beat himself to death.

The drug, which was banned in the UK just days after the incident, has also been blamed for half a dozen deaths in the US.

Tests on Mr Harris’s body showed alcohol and traces of cocaine but although no evidence of N-Bomb was discovered, assistant Bolton coroner Geoff Saul ruled that there was ‘significant circumstantial evidence’ that he had taken the drug on a strip of paper he believed was soaked in LSD.

Similar in chemical make-up to LSD, it can give the distorted appearance that time and movement are going faster or slower.

Colour, sound and objects can get distorted visually and users can experience extreme double vision.

Mr Harris, who worked as a lifeguard at leisure centre Whitworth Baths and was expecting a baby with his girlfriend, died on May 28 last year, two days after taking the drug at a party.

Lethal reaction: N-bomb has since been reclassified as an illegal substance since a number of deaths were linked to the drug

Fear: The coroner presiding over Mr Harris's inquest issued a warning over the illegal drug, which is a powerful hallucinogen similar to LSD

Distressed: An inquest was told that Mr Harris became agitated after taking the 'N-Bomb' drug before throwing himself at a window

N-Bomb is known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana.

Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, died in January after taking N-Bomb, which he mistakenly thought was LSD.

Anthony Carlson, also 18 and from Scottsdale, died three months later after taking just a few drops of the drug up his nose. 

And Clayton Otwell, 21, of Little Rock, Arkansas, died in October 2012 after taking a single drop of the drug at a festival.

Other deaths have been reported to be linked to N-Bomb over the last few years in California, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia.

The drug can be consumed in powder or liquid form.

He had been on a night out clubbing in Manchester before heading to the party with his friend Steven Higgins, 27, at a luxury flat in Salford.

The inquest was told Heather Turner, 28, who lived in the flat, had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his friend.

He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect before visiting the Glastonbury festival.

Bolton coroners’ court was told Mr Harris snorted cocaine and drank vodka before he took the ‘strip’ of the drug - which is also known as ‘smiles’ or ‘25I’ after its chemical name 25I-NBOMe.

Witnesses said he at first appeared calm but become agitated and was heard to shouting and pleading, ‘I want it to stop’ as he suffered from terrifying hallucinations.

The inquest heard Mr Harris threw himself at a floor-to-ceiling window then smashed a glass on a bedside cabinet and stabbed himself repeatedly in the neck with a thick shard.

Friends battled to stem the wound and he was rushed to hospital, but the inquest heard he lost so much blood that his brain was damaged after he suffered a cardiac arrest.

The drug has been banned since June 10, 2013 under a temporary class drug order and will remain illegal for at least 12 months while drug experts consider the full range of harms.

Police arrested Miss Turner and Mr Higgins over the tragedy but concluded no crime had been committed as the drug was a legal high.

Mr Saul recorded a verdict of death by misadventure and issued a warning over the drug.

Drug: Bolton coroners' court was told Mr Harris snorted cocaine and drank vodka before he took the 'strip' of the drug - which is also known as 'smiles' or '25I' after its chemical name 25I-NBOMe

Involved: Steven Higgins (pictured) supplied the N-Bomb drug to Jake believing it to be LSD, which he wanted to 'test' before visiting the Glastonbury music festival in June, the inquest was told

'On the balance of probability, I find that he did take it and he suffered an adverse reaction as a consequence,' he said.

'There are reports of highly disturbed reactions.

'He may have stabbed himself in a frantic attempt to stop the effects of the drug.'

Mr Harris went to a luxury flat at the Spectrum apartment complex near Manchester city centre

High spirits: Mr Harris had been on a night out clubbing in Manchester before heading to the party with his friend Steven Higgins, 27, at the apartment

Tragedy: The inquest heard Mr Harris threw himself at a floor-to-ceiling window then smashed a glass on a bedside cabinet in the flat and stabbed himself in the neck

The coroner added: 'What was thought to be LSD was a substance known as 25I-NBOMe.

'In my judgment, there is strong circumstantial evidence that he did in fact take the substance.

'On the balance of probability, there was a deliberate intention by Jake to take the tablet for recreational purposes. There were unintended consequences.'

Hearing: Bolton Coroner's Court was told that there had been a deliberate intention by Mr Harris to take the tablet for 'recreational purposes'
