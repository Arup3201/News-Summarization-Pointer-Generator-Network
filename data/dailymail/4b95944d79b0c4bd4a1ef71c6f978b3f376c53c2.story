Pace on the pitch and patience among the paying public. Will that be enough to see off the proven winners in hot pursuit? A nation awaits the answer.

The lunchtime clash between the top two in Scotland’s second tier is of interest far beyond the core supports of either Hearts or Rangers; events in Gorgie will provide a focal point, taking point and – almost certainly – starting point for arguments and opinions the length and breadth of the country.

Heck, the debate surrounding the respective merits of the Championship challengers has already started. And it does rather feel as if the weight of opinion is veering strongly towards the home side at Tynecastle.

Hearts, who are  currently six points clear at the top of the Scottish Championship, face Rangers on Saturday

Shortly after seeing both protagonists up close, Jimmy Nicholl made a snap judgment to declare Hearts the more dominant and potent force.

He qualifies that a little now, pointing out that his Cowdenbeath team had faced the Jambos in Edinburgh while Rangers had toughed it out in the dreich surroundings of Central Park.

For all his talk of the quality available to Rangers, though, Nicholl still seems to be leaning towards a home win – for reasons beyond touch, technique and tactics.

The former Rangers and Manchester United player, who likens the fixture to the winner-takes-all Old Firm ‘title deciders’ of old, told Sportsmail: ‘The pace of Hearts is really something.

‘But I’ll tell you another factor. Something more important. Do you know, we were drawing one each with Hearts at half-time, Cowdenbeath against a team flying high, a team expected to batter us – and they weren’t booed off the pitch at half-time.

‘Out of all the games that we’ve played, that’s the one that stuck with me. The Hearts fans wouldn’t even think of booing their team at 1-1 at half-time against Cowdenbeath, bottom of the league with one point.

‘Hibs were booed when we went 2-1 up with half an hour to go. People were walking out. So I think it’s a massive thing that the Hearts supporters are sticking with them, irrespective of how the game is going.

‘It’s because they’re young bucks, they’re playing with enthusiasm. The fans are just saying: “Away you go, give it everything – we’re right behind you”.

Ally McCoist's side drew their last game but won eight consecutive matches before that

‘Supporters are entitled to boo. Hearts fans would have every right to boo their team off at 1-1 against us. But they didn’t do it.

‘I think that’ll be a major plus for the Hearts players because, as the season goes on, there will be nervous and anxious times, fighting to be top of the league. The fact that those fans seem willing to stick with them is a great thing for the players.’

All the understanding in the world, of course, isn’t worth more than a goal-scoring striker or a solid defence. In pure football terms, it would be utterly daft to write off a Rangers team who had put together an eight-game winning run before last weekend’s slip-up at home to Alloa.

‘Out on the park, Hearts have the pace to hurt you - they do have more pace than Rangers,’ said Nicholl.

‘But you know it takes different ways to win a football match. People say: “Oh, Rangers don’t have the pace of Hearts”. Yeah but they still went on that long winning run and they could still be only three points behind after this weekend.

‘It doesn’t matter, we’ve all got different styles, different players and different types. Do Hearts give you more problems than Rangers do? Yes. But they’re different problems.’

Two men previously prolific in a Rangers shirt were recruited in the summer to help provide the goals required to win promotion. While Kenny Miller (four) and Kris Boyd (two) have yet to set the Championship alight following their returns to Ibrox, Nicholl insists the duo are still playing their part for Ally McCoist’s men.

‘Rangers have Boyd and Miller, and a good way of using them,’ he continued. ‘Hearts have good players with pace – it’s two different styles.

‘For me, I know Boyd and Miller aren’t the way they used to be. I know that. But the threat is always there.

‘Can you deal with that? You try – but you can’t take away from their quality. Give them half a yard and they’ll finish.

‘It’s OK to say they’re maybe not the players they were. You can’t avoid the fact that they’ll punish any lapse in concentration. It’s also hard to score goals against Rangers.

‘Rangers were on an unbeaten run of eight games before they drew at home to Alloa, which was a surprise to everybody.

‘Do Hearts look like they’re going to drop points at home to the likes of us or some of the other boys? You would say no.

‘But then you would have expected Rangers to beat Alloa, having been in great form.’

With six points between the clubs currently, a victory for either on Saturday would be significant. Hearts have the momentum after last weekend but Nicholl is aware that such things can be fleeting.

‘Rangers could win on Saturday and that changes everything,’ he said. ‘The boys asked me after Rangers beat us 3-0 at our place, what did I think (about who the better was). I had to say Hearts, because they were the most convincing winners against us.

‘We were still in the game with Rangers at half-time, we scored an own goal in the second half and then they made it three. But we were in it.

‘Hearts beat us 5-1 and really dominated us. From the three of them, including Hibs, Hearts have been the most convincing.

‘But what I have said, and will say again, is that Hearts haven’t been to Cowdenbeath yet! Seriously, it’s OK them beating us 5-1 at their place. I can make a better assessment after both teams have been to us.

‘I would like to assess the two of them properly after they’ve been to Cowdenbeath, because we know it’s a difficult place for away teams.

‘If they are as convincing as they were in the second half at Tynecastle, then I would say Hearts are definitely the top team.

‘The wee boy Dale Carrick came off the bench for Hearts in the second half against us. Off the bench! And he scored two against us.’

Arguments over who is the better side at least have the potential to be settled – if only temporarily – at a stroke tomorrow. As for what the result means to the title race, well, there is a strong argument to say that Rangers, having lost at home to Hearts early in the season, can’t afford to surrender more ground to their rivals.

‘I look at this Championship and say it’s like when Rangers and Celtic were in the SPL,’ said Nicholl. ‘If the two of them were there, one of them was always going to win it.

‘That’s why the big emphasis was on the results between them. OK, they would drop points during the season to the like of Aberdeen and Dundee United, both teams did that, but the title would be settled on the results between each other.

‘Now, Hearts have already beaten Rangers. And they’ve beaten them at Ibrox. Does that mean they’ll go on to win the league?

‘I think it’s going to be between the two of them, which means the results between the sides will be vital.

‘That makes this weekend really important, especially if Rangers go nine points behind. That’s a lot to catch up.

‘It’s definitely Scotland’s game of the day, no doubt. That was going to happen this season, wasn’t it? It’ll be great.’
