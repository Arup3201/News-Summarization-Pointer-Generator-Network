Wasps lost the last remaining unbeaten home record in the Aviva Premiership as they suffered a 26-17 defeat at the hands of Saracens.

Saracens have now beaten their opponents in 10 of their last 11 fixtures as Wasps threw away an early 17-3 lead.

Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode had seen them build up that lead but after that first 20 minutes, the Saracens pack were too strong and ensured the visitors were deserved winners.

Saracens scored two tries through Jackson Wray and Chris Wyles with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties.

Lock Bradley Davies returned from Welsh squad duties to start for Wasps but prop Jake Cooper-Woolley was ruled out with concussion. Italian international, Lorenzo Cittadini was his replacement.

Saracens were able to include England's Alex Goode, Mako Vunipola, Brad Barritt and Richard Wigglesworth in their starting line-up. Wing David Strettle was rested so there was a call-up for Wyles.

A poor kick from Chris Ashton gave Wasps an early platform in the opposition 22 and when Saracens were penalised, Andy Goode made no mistake with his kick to put his side ahead.

However that score was soon nullified when Alex Goode took his first kicking chance to tie up the scores.

After 13 minutes Wasps were back in front with the first try of the game. Well-timed passes from Ashley Johnson and Daly gave Wade his chance and the wing powered away down the right flank to kick ahead deep into the opposition 22.

Saracens should have cleared the danger but the ball ran loose for Wade to pounce and score with Andy Goode converting with a superb touchline kick.

Minutes later, Wasps extended their lead with an even better try. Inside his own half, Andy Goode fed Daly with seemingly nothing on but the Wasps centre mesmerised the visitors' defence by running 55 metres to score.

Andy Goode converted and the hosts held a healthy 17-3 lead.

Back came Saracens to mount a period of pressure and they were rewarded when Wray finished off a driving line-out for the try, which Alex Goode converted before adding a penalty.

After 28 minutes, Saracens went ahead for the first time after Wasps lost a line-out in their own half. Vunipola brushed past Johnson's tackle before a neat chip from Wigglesworth saw Wyles collect and hold off the attentions of Wade for the touchdown.

Alex Goode converted but his namesake missed a penalty for Wasps with the last kick of the half so Saracens led 20-17 at the interval.

Within a minute of the restart, Ashton was yellow carded for a high tackle on Rob Miller but the home side could not take advantage as the wing returned with the scoreboard unchanged apart from Alex Goode's third penalty.

Saracens' pack became the dominant force with some skillful kicking from Wigglesworth keeping them on the front foot and they should have gained further reward but Alex Goode's penalty rebounded back off a post.

Saracens suffered a blow when Barritt limped off to be replaced by Tim Streather but the visitors still led 23-17 at the end of the third quarter.

When Saracens were penalised at a scrum, Andy Goode had a chance to reduce the arrears but surprisingly he was off target and the opposition made him pay.

Clever play from Ben Ransom secured the visitors an attacking position and Wasps replacement Guy Thompson pulled down a driving line-out to go to the sin-bin and allow Alex Goode to boot his fourth penalty.
