For Mario Gotze, life just keeps getting better.

Fresh from winning the World Cup for Germany with a decisive extra-time goal, the Bayern Munich attacking midfielder took a holiday with his lingerie model girlfriend Ann-Kathrin Brommel in Ibiza.

The pair were pictured relaxing and sunbathing on a boat - the least the 22-year-old deserves after playing his part in Germany becoming world champions in Brazil.

Gotze came on for Germany in place of Miroslav Klose minutes from the end of the regulation 90, and was a thorn in Argentina's side for the added 30.

The substitute coolly slotted past goalkeeper Sergio Romero to earn the 1-0 win, and save it from going to a nail-biting penalty shoot-out.

His girlfriend, Brommel, was on hand there, too, as she took to the pitch to congratulate her man after winning the World Cup.
