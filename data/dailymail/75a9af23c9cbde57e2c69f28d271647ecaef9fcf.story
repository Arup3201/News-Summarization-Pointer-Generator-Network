Keen golfers can now play all night as well as all day - thanks to these amazing light-up golf balls.

The LED-infused balls light up in one of four colours when they are hit and stay alight for eight minutes after each shot.

They are the brainchild of U.S. company Night Sports USA which also produce light-up tees, fairway yardage markers and flags.

Experts at the company insist they play exactly like a standard golf ball except they float in water so can be retrieved.

A spokesperson said: 'The balls provide the high performance aerodynamics, control, accuracy, feel and distance you expect from a professional quality ball.

'We developed night golf as a fun, innovative way of furthering existing player's game - and also for a bit of fun.

'There are twice as many night time hours as there are day time which makes night time golf perfect.'

The balls, which each have a 40-hour battery life, are available online with a four-pack costing £18.
