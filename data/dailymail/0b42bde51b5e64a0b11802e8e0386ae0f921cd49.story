France are clearly determined to recover from their defeat to Ireland and muscle back into contention for the Six Nations title against Wales this weekend.

The French squad have been hitting the gym hard as they prepare to host Warren Gatland’s side at Stade de France on Saturday.

Phillipe Saint-Andre’s France side lost 18-11 to Ireland last time out whereas Wales escaped with a last ditch 26-23 win against Scotland.

Johnny Sexton did the damage for Ireland against France as he fired 15 points from his kicking for their ninth consecutive victory.

France will have to be wary of fit-again wing George North returning to the Wales starting XV, having sat out the narrow victory over Scotland recovering from concussion.

Alex Cuthbert makes way for North, who missed the Murrayfield win after taking two blows to the head against England earlier this month.

Gatland has made three more changes with Scott Baldwin taking over at hooker from Richard Hibbard and Luke Charteris replaces Jake Ball at lock, whilst Samson Lee reclaims the tight-head spot from Aaron Jarvis.

Wales won this fixture in last year’s Six Nations in Cardiff with a comprehensive 27-6 win in Cardiff.
