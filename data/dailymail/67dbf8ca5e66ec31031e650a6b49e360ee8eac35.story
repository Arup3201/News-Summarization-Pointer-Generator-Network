A Mexican man who needs a double heart and liver transplant has been granted a 90-day humanitarian pass by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

The DHS-approved document grants the 20-year-old man a temporary stay in the US to seek medical treatment.

The 'humanitarian parole' can be renewed while Chua is in the US if he is accepted for the double transplant as the wait for organs could take a long time.

Chua was born with only one ventricle in his heart, causing problems with blood reaching the vital organ

Chua, who plans to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was twice denied a tourist visa and relatives and his doctor say his life is in danger.

Mayra Lopez, Chua's mother, said: 'I don't have words to express my gratitude to everyone who has prayed for us and have helped us find a solution.'

Chua was born with only one ventricle in his heart, causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers. 

His liver has also been damaged.

The cost of Chua's diagnosis in the US is expected to be $13,000, plus travel and lodging expenses. 

His family has resorted to raffles, selling food and accepting donations to raise the funds.

The double transplant itself could cost as much as $2million. 

Consejo de Latinos Unidos, which helps uninsured people get access to medical care, assisted with getting the 90-day pass.

Kevin Forbes, the director of the US-based group, said: 'This is the most complicated case that we have had since we started doing this.

'We've never been involved in the transplant waiting list and the complications this implies.

'They will evaluate if it is possible to operate, and in the case that it is, he will have to wait and live near the hospital until the organs arrive. 

'It could be months or years of waiting.'

Forbes said the cost of Chua's treatment and diagnosis would be negotiated with the hospital.

He said a campaign to raise the money would be launched, including an online crowdfunding effort.
