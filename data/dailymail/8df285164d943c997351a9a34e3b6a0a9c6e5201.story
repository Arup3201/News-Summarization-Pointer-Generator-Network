A Las Vegas woman was sentenced to almost 14 years in state prison for conspiring with her brother and son to kill her estranged husband for $250,000 in insurance money.

A fight broke out in the courthouse hallway between people who watched 43-year-old Amy Bessey deny again Wednesday that she had any part in the November 2012 wounding of Robert Bessey as he drove on Interstate 15.

A jury in November found Amy Bessey guilty of all seven felony charges against her, including conspiracy and attempted murder.

Sneaky: Amy Bessey, 53, is askedg her son and her brother to kill her

Amy Bessey's ex-convict brother, Richard
 Pearson, and her son, Michael Bessey, have since pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy and attempted murder charges. They're scheduled for 
sentencing April 30.

Court security marshals quickly broke up the hallway scuffle, and no arrests or injuries were reported.

Amy
 Bessey asked her son and her brother to kill her 
husband as he drove to work in November 2012 so she could cash in on a 
$250,000 life insurance policy before their divorce was finalized.

Robert Bessey was hit in the neck by a shot fired from a gold SUV in the
 lane next to his about 4:30am, but he survived. He recognized the 
SUV as belonging to the girlfriend of his then-brother-in-law Richard Pearson.

Liar: Bessey denied having anything to do with the shooting but admitted she 
did at one time say, 'I was fed up. I just wanted it to be done. I just 
said it. I wish he was dead'

During the trial Bessey denied having anything to do with the shooting but admitted she did at one time say, 'I was fed up. I just wanted it to be done. I just said it. I wish he was dead', but explained it was because she was tired of him and the divorce.

She referred to one incident in May 2012 when he took his 'fist to her face' after she asked about grocery money.

'He took his fist to my face. He took his knee to my rib,' Bessey testified. 'I grabbed my purse and walked out the door.'

She admitted there was a gun in her purse and she could have killed him if she wanted to.

Last week during his testimony, Robert Bessey described the same fight as, 'I was in bed. Amy came in. There was pushing and hitting. I pushed her. She hit me,' ABC reports.

Amy Bessey testified she thought they could save their relationship. 
That was until Robert Bessey pointed a gun at her and Michael Bessey 
upon their return from Texas.

Victim: Richard Bessey, who testified in court during his ex-wife's trial, survived the attempt on his life

Guilty: Amy Bessey, 43, plotted to kill her husband for his life insurance policy

incredibly, Rober Bessey survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial.

He said he was driving his usual route to work at 4:35am November 14 when a gunshot came from a gold SUV.

The couple had been married for 18 years and had three kids together. They each had two children from prior relationships and Bessey adopted Amy Bessey's biological son Michael two years after they were married.

Robert Bessey also testified that Michael had been pulling away from him to be closer to his wife after he returned from the military months before the shooting. .

Prosecutors also showed the court gas station surveillance video that captured Bessey's brother and son not far from the scene of the shooting in a gold SUV that police say was tied to the incident. 

Michael
 Bessey and Pearson 
were charged in the murder plot in 2012, but police only implicated 
Amy Bessey in January 2013 after her son told his cellmate that she had been 
involved.

Co-conspirators: Her adopted son, Michael Bessey, left, and her brother, Richard Pearson,  carried out the attempted murder in 2012. Amy Bessey was found to have an 'unnatural relationship' with her son

She was arrested by Las Vegas police 
on charges of attempted murder, battery and conspiracy to commit murder 
against her husband.

Robert
 Bessey told detectives that his wife and son's 'close' relationship had
 prompted the divorce, while Michael Bessey's ex-girlfriend said Amy was
 also the reason they had broken up.

Relatives claimed the pair had an 'unnatural relationship' and one friend said they would go to nightclubs together and 'grab each other's buttocks', police said.

Plot: Michael Bessey, pictured brandishing a gun on his Facebook page, allegedly told his cellmate that he shot his father to get money from his life insurance plan so he could buy a truck

'Close': Michael Bessey, left, allegedly wrote his mother, right, a letter from jail saying: 'I miss touching you'

Robert Bessey also told police that 
he had read a letter his son had written to his wife from jail which 
said: 'I miss touching you'.

But Amy Bessey was only implicated in the gruesome plot when her son's cellmate, Tremel Palmer, claimed he told him that the three planned the killing and were shocked Mr Bessey survived.

Michael Bessey allegedly told Palmer that he was the one who had fired the bullet. He and Pearson then went to a diner for Amy Bessey to collect them, he allegedly said.

Michael Bessey added that he expected to receive a total of $40,000 from the death, with which he would buy a truck, while his mother would pay off her mortgage, police said.

Bessey said he wanted his father dead because he had physically abused his mother and mentally abused the family, the Journal-Review reported.

He added that he planned to blame the 
plot on his uncle, Richard Pearson, who recently finished a prison 
sentence, by claiming the man had forced him to get involved at 
gunpoint.

In an eerie twist following the shooting, Amy Pearson cooperated with police and handed over her brother and her son to police by identifying them in a video taken at a gas station near the scene.

After her son was arrested in November 2012, she told the Review-Journal: 'I have no idea what's going on. I wish I did.'

Michael Bessey, Richard Pearson and Amy Pearson have all been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm. Richard Pearson was also charged with violation of parole.
