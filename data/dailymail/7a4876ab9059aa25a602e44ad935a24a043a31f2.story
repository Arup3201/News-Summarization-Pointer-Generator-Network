A beautician who glassed another woman in a Belfast nightclub, leaving her victim scarred for life, has been jailed for 15 months.

Natasha Quinn, 21, was out with work colleagues at the popular Belfast's El Divino nightclub on June 30 last year when she was attacked by Alexandria McNairn, also 21.

Bouncers separated the two women who had been pulling each other’s hair.

Before and after pictures taken on the night that Natasha Quinn was attacked by Alexandria McNairn: McNairn was jailed after pleading guilty to unlawful and malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm

As McNairn was led away, the security 
noticed that Miss Quinn had been glassed. Police were called and Miss 
Quinn said that she had been kicked on the back of her legs by McNairn.

Prosecution barrister Kay McKay said: ‘When she turned round, McNairn grabbed her by the throat.

'She received a number of blows to her face and then she felt liquid running into her eyes, which was, in fact, blood.

‘The
 blows to her face caused a long and deep laceration to her forehead and
 onto her eyebrow which needed more than a dozen external sutures along 
with a number of internal stitches.'

McNairn
 was arrested but denied the attack. She claimed that someone had pushed
 her and she had a glass which broke on impact on Miss Quinn's face.

But
 at Belfast Crown Court last month she pleaded guilty to unlawful and 
malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

Miss McKay added: ‘Miss Quinn does have a noticeable scar on her forehead which will require cosmetic surgery.

‘This unprovoked attack has had quite a lasting effect on Miss Quinn as recorded in her victim impact statement.'

A
 defence barrister said McNairn was now ‘deeply remorseful and accepts 
her culpability and full responsibility for her actions'.

Judge
 Gordon Kerr, QC had said in a pre-sentence report that he would pass a 
community order on McNairn. But passing sentence he told her: 
‘Frankly, that is not possible in this case.

‘You
 attacked Miss Quinn in El Divino's with a glass to her face which has 
left her scarred for life and which will require cosmetic surgery.'

‘Taking
 all matters into consideration, I have decided you must serve a period 
in custody and accordingly I sentence you to 30 months of which 15 
months will be served in custody and the remainder on licence.'

McNairn showed no emotion in the dock as sentenced was passed.

After McNairn's guilty plea, Miss Quinn released a picture of herself covered in blood after the incident, and another taken earlier of her dressed smartly for her night out.

'Promised myself I'd put this picture up when this was all over,' she wrote on Facebook.

Outside court, Miss Quinn said she was ‘delighted’ that McNairn had been jailed for the attack.

‘These past 10 months of my life have just been a terrible nightmare. I am just so relieved it is now over,’ she said.

‘I don't know why she did it. She could have done it out of jealousy but I just don't know why. It was totally unprovoked.

‘The
 first I knew of anything was when she kicked me in the back of the leg.
 I turned round and she was just standing in front of me staring 
straight at me.

‘I just looked at her and then she just grabbed me by the throat. I pulled at her hair to get her away from me.

‘She started hitting me repeatedly to the face. After that I couldn't see because of the blood in my eyes.

‘The cut came very close to my eye, right into my eyebrow. I am so lucky I was not blinded.

‘This
 incident has left me scarred for life. I needed 17 stitches to the 
wound and I will require cosmetic surgery to the injury.

‘As a result of what happened to me, I left my job as a make-up artist and I am now working as a freelance.

‘I am just delighted she has gone to prison for what she did to me.’
