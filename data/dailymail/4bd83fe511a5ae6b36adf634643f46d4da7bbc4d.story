If Fernando Torres does nothing else of note during his Atletico Madrid swansong – this will be more than enough. 

He scored his first-ever goal at the Bernabeu with practically his first touch in the first half on Thursday night and then scored a second at the restart to knock Real Madrid out of the Copa del Rey.

After one goal in four months in Italy, a painful decline at Chelsea, and a history of being the butt of Real Madrid supporters' jokes because of his failure to score in the Madrid derby in his first spell at the club, he put the team he vowed he would never play for because of his allegiance to Atletico to the sword with two of the sweetest goals of his career.

The build-up to this game had been all about Real Madrid and the comeback they needed in order to turn around the 2-0 first leg last week. 

Supporters lined the streets to welcome the home team coach and then held gold cards above their head to greet Cristiano Ronaldo as he showed off the Ballon d'Or he won on Monday. The man himself was wearing new boots encrusted with micro-diamonds to mark the event. 

None of this impressed Atletico who took the lead after just 49 seconds.

Antoine Greizmann raced away down the left past Pepe. He crossed intelligently to Torres who coolly slooted his first time effort into the far corner past Real keeper Keylor Navas.

In one glorious moment so many years of frustration had evaporated. Coach Diego Simeone has transformed everything about Atletico Madrid but getting Torres to score against the old enemy ranks with his best achievements.

Simeone was off the bench after the goal calling for calm from his players as Real had the best of the next 10 minutes. But aside from a Gareth Bale header from a Dani Carvjal cross that was easily gathered by Jan Oblak there was little real danger until the 18th minute when Toni Kroos sent over a corner that Karim Benzema knocked down to Ronaldo who was bravely denied by Oblak.

It looked like it was going to be the Slovenian keeper's night but he then he slipped as Ramos rose to connect with a Kroos' free-kick and Real Madrid were level.

The free-kick that led to the goal had come from Torres kicking Ronaldo. Since his goal Atletico Madrid's centre-forward had spent most of his time in his own half trying to help stem the white tide. That tide kept coming and when the ball ran to Ronaldo just inside the penalty area it looked like the perfect moment for the Ballon d'Or winner to get his first goal of the night but first Tiago and then Mario Suarez threw themselves in front of the shot with the latter blocking it.

Juanfran did likewise to deny Ronaldo from Bale's cross, and on it went – red and white striped shirts flinging themselves in front of white ones. Raul Garcia took the Alamo act too far and was booked for kicking Isco.

With Atletico defending so deeply, there was no way through for Real Madrid and Bale's attempts at getting round the back of them were falling short because he was being forced to cross on his weaker right foot. In the second half he was switched to the left to greater effect, but only after lightning struck twice with Torres' second goal.

Greizmann was again the architect but the Atletico number 19 still had work to do. He did it brilliantly getting away from Pepe and finishing past Navas.

The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward had silenced the Bernabeu again. They found their voices once more when Bale crossed from his new position wide left and Ronaldo glanced a header past Oblak but Real were still left needing two goals.

Torres was taken off before the hour and the Bernabeu whistled as one – the crescendo of jeers looked to be music to Torres' ears as he grinned and took his time leaving the pitch.

High in the gods at the Bernabeu around 500 Atletico Madrid fans sang his name, even they could not have written the fairytale played out by their returning favourite son. 

Afterwards Simeone was asked what the 30-year-old Torres who had scored twice against Real Madrid had, that the young Torres didn't.

He said: 'I ask myself the same thing sometimes. He was very young when he was first here. Too young for many of the things that happened to him. The welcome home he got from all the supporters was fantastic and I am pleased for all those supporters that he has made such a good start.' 

Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender wrote on Kicca: 

Fernando Torres got a brace for his childhood team against his & their biggest rivals Real Madrid, it took me back to our defeat of Real Madrid in 2009 when Torres struggled in the first leg as he did last week. 

In the second leg at Anfield he was electric and destroyed them with pace, power & a goal then a celebration in front of the Madrid fans that told us his feeling towards them! That pace and power may have diminished but the two goals tonight will have felt exactly the same!
