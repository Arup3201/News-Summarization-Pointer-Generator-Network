With coffee shops springing up across the country, it seemed Britain’s reputation as a nation of tea drinkers was under strain.

But a study has revealed that our love affair with the cuppa is still as strong as ever.

We typically brew up three-and-a-half times a day, although one in four thirsty Britons will get through five cups or more.

The poll for WRVS, a charity that provides support for older people, revealed 35 per cent of people like their tea to be mid-brown, with only 3 per cent preferring their tea very milky.

One in five like to brew their tea in a teapot, while a traditional 6 per cent still use a cup and saucer.

And 7 per cent are so picky that they will not let anyone else make them a cuppa.

Scots have the sweetest teeth, with 41 per cent taking sugar in their tea compared to just 26 per cent in Yorkshire.

Unsurprisingly, tea was seen as a comfort drink – 43 per cent of people claimed they feel better after a brew.

Almost a third said that if a friend received bad news they would offer to put the kettle on.

The study of the nation’s tea-drinking, which  surveyed 2,000 people, marks the Great Brew Break fundraising event.

Launching on Monday, April 29, it’s aimed at raising money to alleviate loneliness among older people.

Verity Haines, from WRVS, said: ‘A cup of tea, when it comes with a friendly ear, is a welcome combination.

'But it’s particularly important to many of the older people we support who may not see anyone but a WRVS volunteer that week.

'In May, we celebrate our 75th Anniversary and throughout the years, the charity has become renowned for its tea making abilities.

'Our focus now is on improving the lives of older people and the money raised through this campaign will mean more older people will benefit from the practical support, comfort and kindness our volunteers provide.
