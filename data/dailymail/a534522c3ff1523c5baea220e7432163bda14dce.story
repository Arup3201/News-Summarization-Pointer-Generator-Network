The family of a rally fan who was killed when a car ploughed into a group of spectators on Saturday have said he died 'watching the sport he loved'.

Len
 Stern, who was hit by the vehicle as he watched the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders, has been described as a 'special uncle' who was 'well-loved by his family'.

The 71-year-old from Bearsden, Glasgow, and Iain Proven, 64, who was also killed, have been pictured for the first time today.

The third victim was Elizabeth Allan, 63, who was standing by the side of the road when a high-performance Citroen DS3 went over a humpback bridge before hitting the spectators.

IIn a statement, Mr Stern's family said he was a 'a special uncle who was well-loved by the family.'

They added: 'His death is really tragic but he died watching the sport that he loved. Our thoughts are with the driver and his family during this difficult time.'

Mr Provan, a retired businessman, had 
survived a serious car accident some years ago. Although also battling 
leukaemia, he continued to attend motorsports events.

His
 family thanked the 'kind thoughts' that have been passed on and praised 
the emergency services for their efforts in the aftermath of the tragic 
incident.

A picture posted on social media shows the 64-year-old with a camera taking notes on the first day of the three-day rally.

 Stephen Tait wrote on Facebook: 'I met Iain at last year's Jim Clark, 
lovely man, and this year I have had the pleasure of covering some 
events for him.

'Will
 miss chatting with him and working for him. My condolences go out to 
his family and friends and also the others, Elizabeth and Len, who were 
involved in this."

Chris
 Collie also posted: 'A very nice man that I met and spoke to only a few
 times but his passion for rallying was in no doubt. Always looking to 
speak with me and find out my rally plans.'

Two other injured men, both 61, are still in hospital - one in a stable condition and one in a critical but stable condition in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

Eyewitness
 Colin Gracey, a 46-year-old teacher from nearby Swinton, said: ‘It was 
very traumatic. It was like a bowling ball hitting skittles. It was 
awful, absolutely awful.’

Safety
 concerns have been raised, as the fatal crash took place only two hours
 after five people were injured, another 61-year-old man critically, by a
 car at the same event.

The 
race was temporarily suspended after the earlier crash at Eccles, 
despite fears about spectators, including children, standing in 
dangerous positions close to the speeding cars.

Police officers examined the scene of the accident to try and determine the cause of the crash

Organisers
 of the 197-mile rally, which was cancelled after the fatal accident, 
insisted the safety of spectators was ‘paramount’ but that the sport is 
‘high risk’. It later emerged one driver considered pulling out of the 
race after claiming spectators were ‘all over the road taking photos’.

Rally
 marshal Ann Reay said: ‘It is the worst outcome you could ask for. It 
is a closed road rally. The public do get too close to the road. It’s 
not the marshals’ fault, it’s not the organisers’ fault, it is people 
getting too close and wanting to see more.’

Photographer
 Craig McAllister, 28, who was covering the rally, said: ‘The marshals 
were telling everyone to move back as the spectators were too close to 
the road – but no one seemed to listen. I protested as there were young 
kids there.

'Myself and the other photographers were really worried, as 
there clearly was a massive safety issue.

‘I
 had a horrible feeling that something bad was going to happen. How 
close do they need to be? I saw young children sitting inches from the 
road and saw a spectator move a barrier to get closer.’

Competitor
 Euan Thorburn, who was spectating when the crash happened, said: ‘When 
the safety car came round to check the track was safe and the position 
of spectators, they stood back – but then they moved too close again, 
about two feet away from the track.

‘I
 told them to move because they were too close to the track and I told 
the marshals to tell them. The marshals did, but they refused to move.’

On
 a motoring forum, a person who did not want to be named said: ‘A friend
 was running a car on this and was telling me that their driver was 
threatening to pull out as the spectators were all over the road. Some 
were standing in the road to take photos and jumping out of the way at 
the last second.’

Rally 
media manager Alan Johnstone said keeping spectators away from the cars 
when the course is long and on public roads is ‘very difficult’. He 
added: ‘Motor sport by its very nature has risks involved. As 
organisers, safety is paramount. We try our best to get it as safe as 
possible. But you’ll never get it 100 per cent safe.’

Superintendent
 Phil O’Kane of Police Scotland said he thought organisers ‘would have 
considered it was safe to move on to the next rally stage’ after the 
first accident. He added: ‘Although safety barriers are put in place, 
there are not stewarding positions along the whole route. It’s a 
high-energy and a high-adrenaline sport and people want to take the best
 positions.’

Borders 
councillor Michael Cook said: ‘The rally has been going without incident
 for over 40 years now and to have this happen has really rocked the 
community. Everybody is very much feeling it and coming to terms with 
what has happened.’

Police 
Scotland is investigating the cause of the crash, but the dramatic 
sequence of photographs shows the Citroen DS3 approaching the humpback 
bridge close behind another car. It was said to be travelling at more 
than 60mph. Onlookers can be seen swarming into the road after the car 
lost control and veered into spectators on the far side of the bridge.

The
 Citroen was being driven by Irishman David Carney, from Westport in Co 
Mayo. He was not hurt, but said to be ‘distraught’. Co-driver Ray 
Fitzpatrick of  Cahir, Co Tipperary was also uninjured.

Mr Provan, Miss Allan and Mr Stern were pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr
 Provan ran a firm called Motorsport Scotland. Neighbours said the crash
 which Mr Provan previously survived had left his wife needing 
round-the-clock care.

Celebrities and leading motorsports figures used Twitter to pay tribute.

Author Ian Rankin tweeted: ‘I’m hearing three spectators dead following crash at Jim Clark Rally. Grim news…’

F1
 driver Jenson Button posted: ‘Terribly sad news from the Jim Clark 
Rally, my thoughts are with those involved and the families that have 
lost loved ones.’
