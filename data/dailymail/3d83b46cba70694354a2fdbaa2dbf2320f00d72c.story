There was an air of nostalgia at White Hart Lane on Sunday. By the end of a disappointing loss against Newcastle, Spurs supporters were yearning for bygone glory days.

Sadly, though, it’s crystal clear the club’s current crop are some distance away from embarking upon a glory era of their own.

In short: Tottenham threw this match away in six seconds.

To rub salt in their wounds their unravelling took place in front of club greats Ray Clemence, Martin Chivers, Alan Mullery and Pat Jennings, who were among the special guests at White Hart Lane as Spurs commemorated the 10th anniversary of legendary manager Bill Nicholson’s death.

Their supporters taunted Newcastle manager Alan Pardew with chants of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ after Emmanuel Adebayor handed the home side a first-half lead.

But Pardew had the last laugh as both his half-time changes — Sammy Ameobi and Remy Cabella — played crucial roles in a stunning Newcastle comeback.

Ameobi equalised, just six seconds after the restart, while Cabella laid on Ayoze Perez’s winner, all before the hour mark. 

‘To start the second half by conceding in the first action — a stupid goal,’ lamented Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino.

‘It was a shock because after that, it all changed in this moment. 

'Seven or six seconds before, all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium.

‘In this moment, I think it was difficult to manage in our head. Our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch.’ 

It was Pardew’s astute decision making that turned this game on its head.

Substitutions change football matches but in this case, they may have saved Pardew’s job.

Where did Ayoze Perez come from? Newcastle beat a host of Spanish clubs to sign the 21-year-old from Tenerife for £1.5m.

Why was there so much interest? Sixteen goals in Spain’s second tier alerted the Magpies and others.

How has he done at Newcastle? His headed winner broke a goalscoring duck after seven substitute appearances.

And that won him a start? Well, he was at the front of the queue when Papiss Cisse failed a fitness test before the game.

Alan Pardew must have been delighted with him... He was, and here’s what he said: ‘He’s a really great individual talent. The players love him so they were really made up he scored the winner.’

After issuing a half-time rollicking to his side for their inept opening 45 minutes at White Hart Lane, the under-pressure manager threw on Ameobi and Cabella in an attempt to stir a revival.

‘We were giving too much possession to Tottenham, too much space,’ said Pardew.

‘We never made a challenge. And we were fortunate to come in at 1-0, so I reminded them about the fundamentals of a Premier League game and we came out with a much stronger attitude.

‘There were a few strong words. It’s not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it’s necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up.’

And it all started so well for the home side, as they dominated the opening exchanges, in terms of possession at least.

Christian Eriksen’s half-volley from distance proved the highlight of a drab opening 15 minutes, as Spurs failed to turn their possession into goalscoring opportunities.

It took 18 minutes for them to fashion a clear-cut chance — and with it came the opening goal. 

Steven Taylor did well to block Nacer Chadli’s fierce shot, but he was helpless to prevent Ryan Mason pouncing on the rebound to stand-up an inviting back-post cross that Adebayor nodded past goalkeeper Tim Krul.

Danny Rose fired wildly over the bar after Eriksen and Erik Lamela combined to set-up the left back, as Spurs put their foot down.

Rose then thought he should have been awarded a penalty as he crossed paths with Gabriel Obertan, but referee Anthony Taylor dismissed Spurs protests, and rightly so after replays showed contact — if any — was made outside the box.

Chadli wasted a good chance in the final moments of the first half — volleying Eriksen’s free kick over the bar when he had ample time to take a touch. 

Pochettino would have been satisfied with his side’s first-half display, if not overjoyed.

With more cutting edge and creativity, Spurs should have been out of sight.

Pardew knew it too, as Cabella and Ameobi replaced the ineffective Obertan and Vurnon Anita.

Straight from the kick-off, Jack Colback found Ameobi, who steamed past Eric Dier down the left, and then neatly finished across Hugo Lloris. 

Pochettino showed little emotion on the home bench, but he must have been furious.

His side, who had looked so comfortable in the first-half, were now firmly on the ropes. 

So goodness knows what he was thinking when Newcastle took a 58th-minute lead when Cabella’s cross from the left was glanced home by Perez, who was making his first league start for Newcastle after seven appearances from the bench.

Newcastle, who scored twice after the break at White Hart Lane, have the highest proportion of second-half goals in the top flight (80%, 8 of 10).

Spurs were lucky not to find themselves 3-1 down eight minutes later when Cabella struck the side netting with just Lloris to beat after a powerful burst down the left that saw Dier and Kaboul trailing in his wake.

Pochettino threw on midweek hat-trick hero Harry Kane and Aaron Lennon in the hope of salvaging something from the game.

Unlike Newcastle’s super subs, they had little impact, and the visitors saw out late pressure to secure their first Premier League away victory since March 1.
