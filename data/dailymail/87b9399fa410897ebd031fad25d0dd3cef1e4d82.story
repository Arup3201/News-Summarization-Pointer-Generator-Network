The world invested almost a billion dollars a day to limit global warming last year, according to a recent study.

These figures come from the latest Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) report which found that the overall spend in 2012 was in fact $5 billion less than a year earlier.

While this may seem like a huge amount, the total for the year ($359 billion) is only just half of the $700 billion per year that the World Economic Forum claims is need to address climate change.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) claims that $5 trillion is required by 2020 for clean energy projects alone.

‘Climate related investments have fallen well short of even the most conservative needs estimates for successive years, making the requirement of “catch up” very real,’ said the report.

The report, Landscape 2013, added that money invested in clean energy was tiny in comparison to the money used in fossil fuels subsidies.

IEA this year estimated that fossil fuel subsidies in 2011 reached approximately $523 billion for developing and emerging economies alone.

By way of comparison, the same study estimated global renewables subsidies of $88 billion, including $20-22 billion for biofuels.

Last week EU energy commissioner Günther Oettinger was accused of attempting to conceal information on the full scale of the subsidies used for fossil fuels.

However, 10 of Europe's biggest utilities are currently calling for cuts to renewable energy subsidies, arguing that they are driving up energy costs and distorting the power market.

Some 38 per cent of this year's climate investment – $135 billion – came from the public sector, according to the CPI study.

‘There is some cause for optimism,’ said the report. ‘Although private investment has declined in general terms, technology costs for large-scale renewable energy have fallen further, perhaps as economies of scale start to take hold.’
