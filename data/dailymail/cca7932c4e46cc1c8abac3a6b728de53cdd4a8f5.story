Sisters from the infamous ‘God Hates Gays’ extremist religious hate group, who picket military funerals and high profile events, have apologised for the ‘hurt’ they caused after leaving the family church to start a new life.

Megan Phelps-Roper, 27, and her sister Grace, 19, have left the controversial Westboro Baptist Church founded by their grandfather, which saw them holding placards with the words ‘God Hates Fags,’ ‘Fags Doom Nations’ and ‘Thank God for Dead Soldiers', at the funerals of U.S. personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and publicly celebrating when a stranger contracts cancer.

Miss Phelps-Roper, who was once called as the ‘future leader’ of the church, has confirmed that after 27 years she has made the decision to leave, effectively being cut off from her family.

She wrote on blog platform medium.com on Wednesday: ‘Up until now, our names have been synonymous with “God Hates Fags”.

‘We know that we’ve done and said things that hurt people. Inflicting pain on others wasn’t the goal, but it was one of the outcomes. We wish it weren’t so, and regret that hurt.

‘We know that we dearly love our family. They now consider us betrayers, and we are cut off from their lives, but we know they are well-intentioned. We will never not love them.’

Miss Phelps-Roper ran the church’s social media presence, posting on Twitter up to 150 times a day from her phone, and her mother, Shirley, had called her her ‘right-hand man’.

Strong views: Made up mostly by the Kansas-based Phelps family, the religious group blames most tragedies on what they call a 'pro-gay' agenda in America

She acted as a spokesperson for the group and did hundreds of interviews with journalists from all around the world.

She
said: 'Until very recently, this is what I lived, breathed, studied, 
believed, preached – loudly, daily, and for nearly 27 years.

'I never thought it would change. I never wanted it to. Then suddenly: it did. And I left.'

Church member Margie Phelps took to Twitter today as news broke of Ms Phelps-Roper’s departure from the church.

She posted: 'Some day 
@washingtonpost will get it-standard of God doesn't change for anyone, 
including #NotOfUs @meganphelps.'

Westboro Baptist Church has made international news many times for its strong views against homosexuality.

'Future leader': Ms Phelps-Roper was once described as the next leader of the church founded by her grandfather Reverend Fred Phelps

Made up mostly by the Kansas-based 
Phelps family, the religious group blames most tragedies - from the 
death of American soldiers to the recent massacre of 20 children and six
adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School - on what they call a 'pro-gay' 
agenda in America.

Recently,
Margie Phelps said in a video-taped interview that God sent 
the 20-year-old Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, to kill 20 people in Connecticut in December last year 
because the state legalized same-sex marriage. 

'Connecticut
was one of the first states to come out with same-sex marriage,' Phelps
said as she sat beside a blood-red-stained sign that read: 'God sent 
the shooter.'

Former member Libby Phelps Alvarez, 29, recently spoke about her departure from the church and finding peace in her new life which did not restrict her from having a haircut, traveling and being confined to the borders of the U.S.

She decided to leave after church members confronted her about a bikini she had worn during a family vacation that she decided to follow her brother’s lead, who had left two years earlier.

Estranged from her family, Mrs Phelps Alvarez now lives in Lawrence not far from the University of Kansas campus with her newlywed husband, Logan.

Documentary maker Louis Theroux has made two documentaries, in 2007 and 2011, about the Phelps family, interviewing founder Reverend Fred Phelps, Ms Phelps-Roper’s mother and Megan herself. He made the second documentary, with the title 'America's Most Hated Family in Crisis' after two other young members of the church decided to leave.

He said at the time: ‘I’ve always been fascinated by this organisation. They operate as a cult, but are pretty unique in that they have allowed the media, and me, in. Yet after our first programme, two of the children of the family left the church, and contacted me. 

‘I’m not claiming they left because of the programme, but it was obviously a factor. I was curious to go back, to see why.’
