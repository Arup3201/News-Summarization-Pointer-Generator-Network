Alessandra Ambrosio has put some clothes ON for her latest fashion campaign. 

The Victoria's Secret angel, 33, is seen sporting a white scientist's coat as the star of Replay's new advert. She appears with handsome Barcelona FC footballers and some talented dancers as the group test the limits of the brand's super-stretchy Hyperflex jeans.

Wearing a pair of white £145 super skinnies from the range, and showing off her incredible long legs, the mother-of-two struts to her laboratory at the beginning of the clip to observe her subjects from behind a pair of geek-chic glasses.
