The two-day event is aimed at 
bringing together keen amateurs, budding enthusiasts, professional 
photographers and industry experts in a lively arena of debate and 
display.

This year’s keynote speech will be 
delivered by the American photographer Michael ‘Nick’ Nichols, editor at
 large for photography at National Geographic.

Charlotte Geeves, Festival & 
Events Director of Wildscreen, the charity behind WildPhotos, said: ‘In 
addition to being able to rub shoulders with the world’s greatest

best British and international photographers appeals not only to those 
in the industry but to anyone interested in how nature photography can 
be a powerful medium in supporting the conservation of the natural 
world.’
