Nicolas Sarkozy had at least eight ‘secret’ meetings with the prosecutor investigating him over corruption allegations, a French court has heard.

Mr Sarkozy is facing possible charges that he took cash in envelopes from France’s richest woman Liliane Bettencourt, the l’ Oreal heiress, to fund his election campaign in 2007.

Yesterday, a Bordeaux court questioned the close relationship between the former president and investigator Philippe Courroye, who was in charge of the enquiry until November 2010.

The pair were said to have met regularly when details of the Bettencourt case began to be investigated while Sarkozy was still president.

Details of the meetings – some of which took place in public parks or at dinner parties – emerged in emails and other correspondence seized from Sarkozy’s office.

One secret meeting took place on June 10th 2010 – two days after member of Mrs Bettencourt’s family had made submissions to the Paris financial brigade.

The Bordeaux court is considering formal charges against Sarkozy over his links with Mrs Bettencourt.

Jacques Chirac also went through a criminal trial for fraud which resulted in a suspended sentence

Judicial sources in Bordeaux confirmed that Judge Gentil was considering action over the highly suspicious ‘eight rendezvous’ between the prosecutor and politician, who had known each other for some 12 years.

While some believe Sarkozy will be quizzed ‘as a witness’, judicial sources told AFP, France’s national news agency, that ‘he may be indicted’.

This would mean him facing the kind of criminal trial which his former mentor and predecessor as conservative president, Jacques Chirac, went through.

Chirac ended up receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last December, becoming the first head of state in the history of the Fifth Republic to be treated as a common criminal.

In Sarkozy’s case, Judge Gentil is also examining evidence that Sarkozy ‘abused the weakness’ of Mrs Bettencourt, who celebrated her 90th birthday on Wednesday.

Investigators are examining the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of euros from Swiss bank accounts, and the claim that cash was delivered in brown envelopes.

In return, it is claimed, Mrs Bettencourt was offered massive tax breaks on her multi-million pounds fortune after Sarkozy came to power.

Sarkozy, who lost May’s presidential election to Socialist Francois Hollande, has denied a series of allegations of illegal campaign financing.
