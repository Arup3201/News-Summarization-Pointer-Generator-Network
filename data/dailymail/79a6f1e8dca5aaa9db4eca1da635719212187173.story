Stalking through the rough grass a runaway rhea scopes its next move.

This footage is the first video captured of the South American bird, which is the height of man and can disembowel a human with one thwack of its three-pronged claw.

Despite the bird's size - they can weigh up to 90lb -  as the hunt for the runaway rhea of Essex gathers momentum, the locals seem to be treating the whole thing as a bit of a laugh.

The Daily Mail tracked down this giant flightless bird – a 45mph ostrich-cum-emu usually found on South American pampas – to a golf course outside Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire. 

Latest sighting: Charmaine Lake captured this image of the missing rhea bird which can run at speeds of up to 40mph at Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire

Tracked down: Despite the missing rhea bird being capable of killing a man with a single whack of its claw, locals at the Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, pictured, don't seem concerned

And by close of play yesterday evening, the ‘birdie’ gags were becoming unbearable in the 19th hole at Barkway Park Golf Club.

Mind you, they might not be chortling quite so happily the next time they’re poking around in the rough for a missing ball …

For even if we have now narrowed down the chase, no one seems to think there is much chance of trapping this monster feather duster in the near future.

It is nearly four weeks since the six-year-old female rhea went on the run from Jo Clark’s smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border. Jo has kept rheas for many years – among her horses, sheep, geese, ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres.

No one is entirely sure why the bird escaped, although Jo thinks it may have been spooked by the local hunt passing nearby. ‘I followed her for four hours with a bucket of food, but you can’t herd these creatures and so I gave up,’ says Jo, who still has three remaining rheas, all one-year-old offspring of the runaway mum.

Since rheas are not remotely maternal (after laying their eggs, they leave the hatching and childcare to the males), it is unlikely that this one will be feeling any pangs of remorse. Certainly, as I drop in on the abandoned trio, they all seem perfectly happy. In recent days, however, there have been sporadic sightings of Mum across a five-mile radius hereabouts.

Spotted: A cyclist took this picture of the fugitive South American rhea - which stands at around six-foot tall - in countryside north east of Stevenage in Hertfordshire at the weekend

On the hunt: The Daily Mail's Robert Hardman goes in search of the missing rhea bird in the rape seed fields of Astey, Hertfordshire

On Sunday, civil engineer Tim Bradshaw managed to take a charming shot of the animal in a field of rapeseed just outside the village of Anstey.

Since then, a media circus has descended, armed with lurid warnings about the  damage these birds can inflict when cornered. As I rapidly discover, though, we’re not exactly talking Beast of Bodmin, let alone Jaws.

‘We’re all looking out for it now,’ says Tim’s wife, Madeleine, a piano teacher. ‘It’s funny because my husband’s always been a keen photographer and so has his father.

‘His dad once had a picture published in the Bath Chronicle. Now, Tim’s gone one better with a picture in the national papers and we’ve even had Have I Got News For You on the phone!’

Son Harry, ten, is determined to go one better and has been out trying to capture some video footage. Is he a little scared? After all, the RSPCA and the cops are warning people not to approach the bird, even though Jo Clark’s young brood wouldn’t say boo to one of her geese.

He said: 'You can see the bird 
standing in a couple of the shots, in the others it was grubbing around 
in the rape field for food, or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in
 the sand.

'It was about six feet high with its head up.'

Big bird: The runaway rhea was also photographed near Brent Pelham on Thursday by cyclist Ray Murdoch

Mr Murdoch took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of rape seed oil

‘I’m not worried,’ says Harry. ‘It’s good fun.’ The locals have already named the bird Chris – after the singer, Chris Rea – despite the fact that this rhea is a she.

There is no great desire to see her returned to captivity. In fact, everyone seems to wish ‘Chris’ the best of luck.

‘I hope people just leave it alone. It’ll be fine out there and there’s plenty for it to eat,’ says Di Pyper.

As the joint master of the local hunt, the Puckeridge, Di knows this terrain better than anyone and agrees to be my guide. She first learned of the creature from her sister-in-law.

‘She’d just fallen off her horse and came home talking about seeing an ostrich. We all thought she must have concussion and told her to lie down. Then other people started saying the same.’

Today, she has heard reports of sightings five miles away, near the 12th fairway at Barkway Park Golf Club, and off we go.

It’s charming countryside, narrow lanes meandering through gently undulating crop-filled fields sprinkled with thatched cottages and handsome little churches.

We’re only 35 miles from London and a short drive from Stansted Airport, but it’s a tranquil spot  with plenty of hedgerows and woods to provide cover for a furtive feathered giant.

Barkway Park is a delightful little 
club. At the clubhouse, Anthony Smith has just finished a round. Has he 
seen a grey/brown South American bird, about 5ft 8in tall? ‘So that’s 
what it was,’ he says. ‘I did catch a glimpse of something running 
across the 11th fairway.’

Really hard to spot: The six-foot bird has been on the run for a month. They are also incredibly hard to catch because of their fast speeds

Disappeared: The rhea escaped from a smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border

The hunt closes in. I meet greenkeeper Carl Edwards. He and his colleague, Anthony Lake, have not just seen the bird a few hours earlier, they have managed to capture it on their mobile phones.

‘Anthony just said: “There’s that emu!”. It was about my height and minding its own business so we started filming,’ says Carl, showing me the result. Sure enough, there is ‘Chris’, snooping around the western edge of the course. She certainly doesn’t seem to pose a threat and just ambles off into the bushes when the two men get too close.

Later on, Anthony’s wife, Charmaine, says that she spotted the bird while out with her two young children and grabbed a snap of it on her phone. It is dashing across a nicely manicured fairway as purposefully as a club captain who has just spotted a non-member wearing inappropriate trousers and teeing off in the wrong direction. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw it,’ she says, ‘but I’m not sure I’d want to get too close to it.’

By last night, word of our progress had spread and the media circus had started to descend on the fairways of Barkway Park. So why should a wild South American bird take a fancy to golf? Jo Clark has another theory: ‘A few years ago, I did sell a breeding pair to a man near Barkway, and this one will be looking for a mate at this time of year.’

In which case, it may not be too long before this bit of East Anglia starts to see rather more exotic flightless birds running wild and causing mayhem.

I fear I can see an Essex girl joke coming already …
