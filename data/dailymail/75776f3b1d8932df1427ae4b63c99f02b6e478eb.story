When faced with the logistical problem of biking across town with a 180kg sandbag and his beloved pet dog - this Chinese man decided to use his head.

Cai Tangmei, 41, has earned celebrity status and a cult following for his madcap antics and 'tough head' - using balancing skills he learned while working in the circus.

Mr Tangmei, from Cixi, Zhejiang province, adopted the unorthodox carrying technique while working in a plastic factory - as the stairways were to narrow for him to carry bags on his shoulders.
