A gamekeeper has become so at one with his charges that he has become the real life Dr Doolittle, and can even photograph some of Britain's most endearing animals from just a few feet.Â 

Adam Tatlow's affinity with nature has allowed him to get so close to the creatures, that many of the resulting charming images, taken in the Cotswold countryside, look as if they have been taken with a zoom lens - but were actually taken right next to their trusting subjects.

The
46-year-old's trusty camera is never far from his side as he goes about
his work as a gamekeeper on a countryside estate.

Beautiful: A gamekeeper has become so at one with his charges that he has become the real life Dr Doolittle, and can even photograph some of Britain's most endearing animals from just a few feet

At one with nature: His charming images include this picture of a pheasant in a flap (left) from just a few feet away, and a winter robin perched on a branch (right)

He
has built up a stunning portfolio of snaps that lift the lid on 
rarely-seen birds and animals found in forests throughout the country.

The 46-year-old's trusty camera is never far from his side

Mr Tatlow's subjects have included timid fox cubs, bounding hares, inquisitive hedgehogs and colourful kingfishers.

He is so at one with nature that he knows how to call animals to him.

They are so comfortable with him that he often gets within 30ft of them.

The father of two, is from the village 
of Guiting Power.

He said: 'I have had a love of wildlife and nature ever 
since I was old enough to be out of the house on my own.

'I
would spend all day out in the woods and would only come back when it 
got dark - I built up I built up a real affinity for it.'I
got into photography when I was about 16.

'But I have always considered 
myself far more of an animal person than a photographer.'That carried on with my job as a gamekeeper.

'I know how to get close to animals and how to get them close to me.

That's the key to being a good wildlife photographer, and it's just what I've done all my life.

'When I'm at work I always keep my camera close to hand.

The kit I use is quite rudimentary - my camera is just a basic digital SLR with a 70mm-200mm lens.

'Most of my shots are taken within 30ft of the animals. In fact, sometimes the animals get so close the lens can't focus.

'Half of the shots I take are completely opportunist, but I also know where and when to find animals to photograph.

'I know how to call the animals so they come closer to me. 'I don't wear anything special, just my work clothes.

'I love to show people what's out there, often right under their noses but unnoticed.'
