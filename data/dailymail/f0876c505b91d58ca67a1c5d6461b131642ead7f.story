Didier Deschamps is big on eye contact. As he answers each question he locks an intense gaze on you with the focus of a man who knows what it takes to win the World Cup.

Deschamps did that, of course, as France captain in 1998 and now he is the man in charge of Les Bleus, looking to become only the third man after Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer and Brazil’s Mario Zagallo to win the tournament as a player and manager.

Not that he thinks he has any chance of achieving that with a team who were dumped out in the group stage in 2010 and qualified for Brazil only by the skin of their teeth.

‘I’m going to Brazil with lots of ambition but I’m a realist, too,’ says the 45-year-old, whose side have been drawn with Switzerland,  Honduras and Ecuador in Group E.

‘There are countries that are much better than us on paper. We can’t hide from the truth. The only match that France won in the group stage of a World Cup in the last 12 years was against Togo in 2006.

‘I can’t talk about winning the World Cup, There are teams who are far ahead of us, including a team who won the last World Cup and the last two European Championships (Spain). There are six or seven. To win it for us would be viewed as a miracle.’

After a few minutes in his company it is clear why the former Marseille, Juventus and Chelsea midfielder is so keen on eye contact.

Deschamps revels in human interaction, something he feels has become lost among current players and something he blames for their  reputation as spoilt, difficult and badly behaved. Samir Nasri, not selected for the World Cup because of his attitude, will surely take note.

‘Managing players is harder these days because of the arrival of new technology,’ says Deschamps. ‘They are all using it in their spare time so they become more isolated and selfish. They share less, they talk less. They have apps, their phones and the internet but they are less used to talking to people.

‘Nowadays you never see players playing cards. We used to sit around playing cards together all the time. But I can’t fight that, I have to adapt and change.

‘So I have to find new ways of getting people to interact because it is still healthy to know whether the guy sitting next to you at dinner has a wife or kids or whatever.’

Out of reach? Deschamps admits France need a miracle to win the World Cup

What Deschamps feels all his players have in  common is vast amounts of money and meddling entourages. And it is the latter which concerns him most.

‘Yes, they have a lot of money but who gives it to them? It is not their fault. Where the problem comes is if a player is given lots of money before they have achieved anything in the game. Because money gives them power.

‘What has also changed is that there are so many people around players these days: the agent, the mother, the father, the brother, the sister, the uncle, an adviser.

‘You get 20 or so people who are living off the player, their lifestyle is supported by him. And they don’t always give him good advice. They need to keep him happy because they need money so they will tell him he is the best and the most beautiful even when he is not.

‘That makes a coach’s job hard. It makes the coach look like an idiot for saying the opposite. It makes relationships a lot harder.’

France, of course, are no strangers to difficult relationships. Their last World Cup campaign was blighted by a players’ strike after coach Raymond Domenech sent home Nicolas Anelka. There was also talk of unrest throughout their recent qualifying campaign, which ended with a nail-biting 3-2  aggregate play-off win over Ukraine.

The same accusations were not  levelled at the now immortalised class of ’98, though Deschamps thinks that winning is the only real difference between then and now. ‘We were seen as a really good team because we won,’ he adds. ‘We were a bunch of competitive guys all together going after the same prize. We were individuals with a common goal.

‘You have to find those kind of players because the danger is you end up with people who are going after individual goals rather than collective ones.

‘These guys are privileged to be playing for France at a World Cup.’ In search of that balance,  Deschamps has blooded plenty of young players over the past two years with mixed success. There have been defeats by Spain,  Germany, Uruguay and Brazil but there was also a recent victory over Holland and a return to form for Real Madrid striker Karim  Benzema, who had previously been dropped by the manager.

However, the form and morale of some of his key Premier League players is not so good. Captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has endured a frustrating year at stuttering Tottenham, Bacary Sagna’s future is up in the air, Olivier Giroud’s form at Arsenal has disintegrated since he was caught with an underwear model in his hotel room ahead of a game, and Newcastle duo Loic Remy and Momo Sissoko are caught up in the increasingly bitter atmosphere at St James’ Park. It is a problem of which Deschamps is fully aware.

Back then: Deschamps said in his day the players would constantly play cards, but now with new technologies they are isolated and selfish

‘For the sake of their confidence, it would be a lot better if they didn’t have problems at their clubs but unfortunately that is what has  happened. And they might be pleased to get away from that in some ways.

It is what happens. The only thing is that normally if the club have a good season, the player has a good season. I will have three weeks with them after the end of the season to make sure they are OK.’

Another hot topic of debate in France is the international form of Franck Ribery. While he has dazzled for Bayern Munich, he has not for his country. Lionel Messi would no doubt sympathise. ‘Franck is very experienced — he was there in 2006 and then in  the tougher times,’ says  Deschamps. ‘He is a leader for us. He is one of the best players in the world but he is a very nice guy, very smiley. And on the pitch he can make a big difference. Him playing as well for us as he does for Bayern is not just down to him, it is down to the rest of the team.

‘We have to help him, too — not just make him feel like he always has to be the one  to win the game  and make the difference.

Aiming high: France are outside favourites for the World Cup

‘You can’t just try to make him another Zidane. It is like looking for another Platini or another Fontaine. Following on from a great generation of players is hard. I had that after Platini retired. We missed the 1990 and 1994 World Cups.’

What about Deschamps making a difference, using his victory from 1998 to inspire his team to great things?

‘They are such good memories. Winning the World Cup is the most wonderful thing a footballer can ask for. That experience of course helps me but I never talk about it to my players now.

‘I have to adapt and deal with the players and the moment. It is part of my past, a wonderful thing but not something that has  anything to do with my players now. I can’t be the same as Aime  Jacquet (France’s World Cup- winning coach). He is different to me and my players are different to our team back then.

‘Every manager I’ve had is a reference point for me — good or bad. There are some that have had more influence than others but I have my personality, too. And you have to adapt. The same thing doesn’t work in two places. Italy had the biggest influence on me but I like my team to be more attacking.

‘I want us to have the ball. That won’t always be possible — if we are playing Spain for example — but that is what I am looking for.’

Deschamps has been busy watching endless videos of Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras — he and Laurent Blanc are the only members of the 1998 squad who are in management — and he is in no doubt about who the favourites are.

‘The Swiss are the favourites for our group. They have been better than us in the past two years. That’s why my goal has to just be beating Honduras on June 15. Honduras might not seem scary to most people but we have to take them seriously.

‘I won’t pretend that we couldn’t  have had a harder draw but I remember that we had a very good draw, too, in 2010 — and that didn’t end well. We cannot underestimate these teams. They are not there by accident.

Three Lions: Deschamps says England are more likely to win the World Cup than France

‘The same teams are the favourites to win it: Spain, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Germany, Holland . . . ’

And what about England?

‘After that come England and Belgium! I’ve met Roy Hodgson plenty of times and they are a strong team still. But what is certainly a problem for the national team is the Premier League. The best players are foreign so there aren’t many English players.

‘But the top players are playing for top clubs so they are used to high demands, to the necessity of winning every match. It is the same for my team.’

That’s why you feel his eyes remain firmly on the prize.
