Easter is the favourite time of year for this petite blonde who loves eating Cadbury Creme eggs so much that she can devour 50 in just six minutes and 15 seconds.

Miki Sudo, 28, from Las Vegas Nevada, who weighs just eight stone, consumed a staggering 8,100 calories in one sitting by eating the Creme Eggs - the same as four days' worth of food for a normal woman.

Miss Sudo can eat grown men under the table and is ranked as one of the best female competitive eaters in the world-raking in £15,000 by stuffing her face.

Easter is the favourite time of year for Miki Sudo who adores stuffing her face with Cadbury Creme eggs - in a matter of seconds. Miki from Las Vegas is a world record holder for devouring 50 Creme Eggs in just six minutes and 15 seconds

And Creme Eggs are no exception.

Miss Sudo munched on 50 Creme Eggs and polished them off in just over six minutes- smashing the previous record of 14 minutes.

She said: ‘No one loves Cadbury's Creme Eggs more than me. I wait all year for these things.

‘They're delicious and fun to eat. When I'm not doing challenges, I like cracking off the top and then I eat all the cream and finish the chocolate shell last.’

The blonde American spends her days travelling the world taking part in monstrous food challenges and competitions.

Creme de la creme: Miki Sudo longs for this time of the year so that she can indulge in her favourite Cadbury's Creme Eggs

She has devoured giant meals including 192 chicken wings in ten minutes and a 120oz steak - the same weight as a new-born baby.

Miss Sudo even managed to finish the world's most calorific burger, the Quadruple Bypass Burger, at the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas.

She was awarded £60 for finishing the giant burger which contains a staggering 9,983 calories - the amount a woman should consume over five days.

Miss Sudo said: ‘I am an adventurous person and competitive too plus I love food – so eating in competitions is just perfect for me.

‘I am a little different and I have a sort of talent for eating.

‘And it is a great feeling being able to eat more than men who are two or three times the size of me.’

She tries to maintain her petite frame but last year gained a stone after just one competition.

She said: ‘I'm constantly in the gym so I can maintain my weight but I gain weight just like everyone else when I'm not working out.

‘I like looking and feeling healthy, but I never let the number on the scales determine my happiness. If I did, I'd be in trouble!’

When she isn't eating Creme Eggs, Miki will normally have one meal a day, which will be a huge salad.

She said: ‘My first and only meal is usually in the early evening. I make a large salad lasts me through the rest of the day.

‘Typically, I use four heads of kale, two avocados, one cucumber, some quinoa, sliced onions, grated garlic, and chopped nuts.

Miss Sudo insists that she is too busy for a boyfriend, but enjoys eating and competing against male professional eaters.

She said: ‘I don't have a boyfriend and at certain times of the year I am travelling around all the time so it's not easy to have in a relationship.

‘But I always think a real man wouldn't be intimidated by the fact that I eat for a living.’
