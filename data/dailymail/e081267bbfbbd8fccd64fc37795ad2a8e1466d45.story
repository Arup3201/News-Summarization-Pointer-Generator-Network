The senseless killing spree by Elliot Rodger that left six others dead and another 13 wounded isn’t the first tragedy to befall the coastal community of Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).

The horrifying events of Friday night have chilling parallels with a 2001 incident when a UCSB freshman ran down and killed four pedestrians.

On Feb 23 2001, David Attias drove his Saab at 60 mph into a large crowd in Isla Vista. He then jumped on top of his vehicle, held both arms in a boxing stance and declared, ‘I’m the angel of death.’

His victims were Nicholas Shaw Bourdakis, Christopher Divis, both 20, Ruth Levy, 20, and 27-year-old Ellie Israel. Another victim, Albert Levy, was permanently injured.

Attias was arrested and charged with murder, although in 2002 a jury declared him insane and he was committed to a Californian psychiatric hospital.

In 2012, a Santa Barbara judge allowed Attias to be released to a less restrictive outpatient program after finding that he was not ‘clearly not the same vacant, troubled and confused’ man, reports the L.A. Times.

On Friday night Rodger stabbed his two roommates and another man, before driving through Isla Vista firing at deputies and pedestrians, while deliberately driving into others.

The coastal town of Isla Vista has now experienced two senseless murder sprees 13 years apart

Rodger died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head
 after crashing his car, but he left behind a rambling 141-page 
manifesto in which he wrote about his vendetta against female kind.

With everything that has been learned about Rodger since Friday night’s 
killing spree, there are many similarities between him and Attias.

Both had fathers in the entertainment business.

Rodger’s father, Peter Rodger, was an assistant director on the 2012 film The Hunger Games, while Attias’ father, Daniel Attias, is a television director who has worked on well-known shows such as The Sopranos and True Blood.

Both had difficulties making friends and were frustrated about their sex lives.

'If only one pretty girl had shown some form of attraction to me, the Day of Retribution would never happen,' Rodger wrote in his manifesto.

'I’d never even consider it. The Day of Retribution is mainly my war against women for rejecting me and depriving me of sex and love.'

Both thought they were superior people and believed they were saving humanity with their deeds.

While Attias’ called himself an 'angel of death,' Rodger’s described himself as a God.

'I will purify the world of everything that is wrong with it,' he wrote. 'On the Day of Retribution, I will truly be a powerful god, punishing everyone I deem to be impure and depraved.'

In both instances, their parents had tried to seek help for their troubled sons.

David
 Attias' father testified that he tried to persuade his son to take his 
medication, which he stopped doing when he began attending UC Santa 
Barbara.

He reportedly suffered from mental illness and had been taking 
numerous medications to control his impulsive behavior.

Rodger's
 parents had warned authorities about their son's behavior in April, 
prompting deputies to go to his home to check on his welfare.

After reading his chilling manifesto on Friday night, they had frantically tried to stop their son from carrying out his plan but heard of the massacre on the radio as they traveled to his apartment.

The 22-year-old had emailed the 140-page document to a couple of dozen people including his parents and at least one of his therapists just hours before he went on his shooting rampage.

Lichin Rodger, the suspect's mother, 
reportedly received the email at 9.17pm and immediately went on to her 
son's YouTube page where she found the newly uploaded video titled 
'Retribution' which describes his plan of 'slaughtering' women at a 
sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Mrs Rodger then alerted her estranged husband, Peter, and after he watched the video she called 911. The former couple then set off from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to try find their son.

But they were too late and heard about the shooting en route.
