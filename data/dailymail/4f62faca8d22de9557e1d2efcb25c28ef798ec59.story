Thibaut Courtois denied Adam Lallana Liverpool's winner in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday with a tremendous one-handed save - and the playmaker still can't comprehend how the Chelsea goalkeeper managed to do it.

Lallana connected perfectly with a knock-down from Raheem Sterling and his strike from 25 yards seemed destined to find the left corner of the net and put Liverpool ahead, until Courtois' outstretched arm somehow managed to tip it around the post.

'I can't believe the 'keeper saved it, I was halfway on my celebration,' Lallana told Liverpool's official website.

Courtois' display made sure that the second leg will be played with level scores next Tuesday

'It was a fantastic save and probably one of the reasons why he got man of the match. He is world-class and Chelsea are a world-class team.'

Courtois made a string of stops to keep Liverpool at bay in the second half of the game at Anfield.

Despite the impressive performance from Brendan Rodgers' side, Lallana admitted there was some frustration at not being able to take an advantage into the second leg at Stamford Bridge next Tuesday.

'We come off the pitch disappointed but still in the game. We'll go to Stamford Bridge and we're fully confident we can go through to the final,' Lallana explained.

Next up for Liverpool is another cup clash at Anfield, against Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round of the FA Cup, before the return encounter with Chelsea.
