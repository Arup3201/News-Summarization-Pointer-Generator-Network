Aspirations: Steven Grisales, who wanted to study architecture, was stabbed to death in Edmonton

The grieving parents of a student stabbed to death by a teenage gang after he asked them to stop throwing conkers said such attacks would never happen in the family's native Colombia.

Breaking down Andre Grisales said he did not understand why his son Steven was killed and said it would not have happened in the parts of South America where the family live and he works.

It comes as a 15-year-old was stabbed in a 
playground in College Close, Edmonton, last night just yards from the spot where 
Steven was killed.

The teenager is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Two people have been arrested.

Mr Grisales described his 21-year-old son as a 'good boy' who had done nothing wrong before he was stabbed.

The aspiring architect, who was born in Britain but whose parents are Colombian, was due to start a course this month as part of a Westminster College scholarship when he was killed on his way to Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, North London last week.

He was on his way to go shopping for his grandmother when he was attacked.

Steven had only returned to the UK three and a half weeks ago from Argentina. His father has been working there and the teenager was spending time with him.

Mr Grisales said his son did not drink or smoke and was not into gangs.

He said: 'It's devastating for all of us, the whole family - aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles - back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it.

'We don't understand. Without a reason, without nothing.'

Youths threw conkers at Mr Grisales and when he stood up to them, one produced a knife.

He was stabbed in the chest and died the following day.

A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder and has appeared in court, while another boy, also 15, has been questioned.

A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl have already been arrested and released on bail.

Speaking from the scene, Steven's mother Jasmid wept as her husband  told of their heartbreak.

The
couple appeared near the murder scene in College Close to pay tribute 
to their eldest child and appeal for witnesses to come forward.

A schoolboy has been stabbed in the same spot where Steven Grisales was killed after remonstrating with conker-throwing youths.

The 15-year-old has been taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition after being attacked near Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, north London.

Two people have been arrested over the stabbing, Scotland Yard said.

Detectives were said to be 'unaware' of any link with the murder of 21-year-old Mr Grisales last week.

Police were alerted to the attack at 6.50pm yesterday to reports of a stabbing in College Close.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at 
the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station. 

'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.'

Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male.

A local resident heard Mr Grisales' screams and ran outside to try and help.

Mary Stokes, 27, told the Enfield Independent: 'I was in the house and heard shouting, as I walked out he was holding his chest.

'I
tried to speak to him but he wasn't saying much. We tried to help him 
but there was not much we could do, he had been stabbed in the heart.'

Floral tributes were left on College Close, near to the murder scene.

The Enfield Independent reported a friend named Courtney left a message 
which read: 'I can't say how much I miss you, I wish you didn't have to 
go.
You will always be in our hearts. Gone but never forgotten.'

Another, from Marie, said: 'A young man with a smile like sunshine, it could light up a room.'

A post-mortem examination revealed cause of death to be a single stab wound to the heart.

Detectives believe up to three young black males, possibly in their late teens or early 20s, attacked Mr Grisales.

Officers said the incident was not gang-related and the young man did not know his attackers.

Detective
Inspector Richard Beadle, of Scotland Yard's murder command, said: 'I 
urge anyone with any information about this incident, or anyone that 
witnessed it, to come forward.

'It happened in a busy residential 
area and we know there would have been a number of people in the area at
the time of the attack.

'I would ask those people to please come forward and assist us with our inquiries.'

Witnesses are urged to call the incident room on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
