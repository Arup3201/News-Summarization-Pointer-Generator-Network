Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini claims that he will not sell striker Alvaro Negredo despite interest from European Champions Real Madrid.

Pellegrini acknowledged that there had been enquiries about the Spaniard from abroad, but insisted that City do not want to let the target man go.

Speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of City's home game against Stoke, Pellegrini said: 'Maybe one month ago some Spanish clubs had an interest in him but that was one month ago.

Wanted: The City striker is now a target for Real Madrid if the European Champions fail in their Falcao bid

'At this moment Alvaro is injured but part of our squad. Last year he did very well and then had an injury with his shoulder and after that he didn't play so well, but he's always an important player for us.

'We don't want to sell him. We want him to stay with us.'

But, according to Spanish paper AS, Real Madrid are still keen to bring the striker, who came through their academy but never made a first team appearance, back to the Bernabeu.

The European Champions are desperate to land another forward, and if they fail to sign Falcao from Monaco could turn their attentions back to Negredo.

City, who have Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic available to play up front, could be persuaded to sell as they are only allowed 17 non-home grown players for the Champions League.
