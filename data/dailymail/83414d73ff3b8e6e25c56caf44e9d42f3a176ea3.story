Simon Shonn outside Bolton Crown Court. He stole £40,000 from his mother which was supposed to pay for her residential care at a home in Manchester

An elderly mother was left on the brink of eviction from her care home after her son plundered her fees so he could go on a £50,000 spending spree.

Simon Shonn, 49, had been put in sole charge of 75-year widow Irene Shonn's finances after she was forced to go into a private residential home due to her Alzheimer's.

But instead of using his mother's savings to pay her weekly £665 living costs, the father-of-one used the money to buy a range of household luxuries for himself.

Despite money being tight, he 
splashed out on expensive electrical goods including TVs, computers and 
music, home improvements, new shoes and meals out at restaurant.

Shonn, of Radcliffe, Bury, was also said to have spent a 'significant amount' of money buying CDs at ailing music store HMV.

The outstanding bill for Mrs Shonn's 
care home fees rose to £29,000 and at one stage she faced eviction under
debt recovery legal action before the local authority stepped in and 
settled the amount at cost to the taxpayer.

Mrs Shonn, whose company director 
husband Alan died 10 years earlier aged 70, is still thought to be living
at the Heathlands Residential Care Home in Prestwich, Manchester, 
looking forward to her son's visits - blissfully unaware of his 
betrayal.

Bank records initially indicated he had pocketed £58,000 of her money.

At Bolton Crown Court, Shonn admitted fraud but was spared jail after a 
judge ruled he should continue visiting her.

The hearing was told Shonn became 
power of attorney to his mother's financial affairs in 2010 when her 
health severely deteriorated to a point where she was forced to moved 
out of her flat in Prestwich.

Shonn - one of three brothers - had 
been in receipt of Carer's Allowance for being the sole carer of his 
mother but it was withdrawn when she was transferred to the care home - 
and her placement was funded with her savings.

Mr
Adam Lodge prosecuting said: 'The defendant having power of attorney 
was responsible for her affairs and he was responsible for paying for 
the care home.

'The cost was
£665 per week plus incidental costs. For the first six months no 
invoice was signed on behalf of her due to non-payment.

'A
great deal of money was spent for the benefit of himself his family and
some was used for day to day living like food with a great deal spent 
on luxurious items like electrical goods, TVs, computers, music, CDs and
a significant amount was spent at HMV.

'There were home improvements carried out, shoes bought and meals out. It was dishonest.

'The
care home were going to evict her from the private care home and they 
were perusing debt recovery proceedings. fortunately it never got to 
that stage and the local authority stepped in.

'There
was a certain amount of correspondence between the defendant and the 
care home and he agreed to pay the arrears and even allowed them to take
out a charge on her property.'

Shonn, of Radcliffe, Bury, was arrested in June 2012 and accepted that he as not acting in the best financial interests of his mother

The court heard that some payment was made towards the arrears but by May 2012 the figure stood at £29k.

Mr Lodge added: 'By this stage the local authority had been informed of the care he's concerns and it was passed onto the police and the Office of Public Guardian.'

In June 2012 Shonn was arrested and accepted that he as not acting in the best financial interests of his mother.

In mitigation the court heard Shonn had single handedly been given the responsibility of the care of his mother and was the only family member who visited her.

Defence lawyer Martin Callery said Shonn had 'succumbed to temptation' and added: 'There came a time when she had to be taken into a home.

'Some of the care he was responsible for was relieved from him but he maintained a constant relationship with his mother who he visited three times a week and while she was living at her own home on a daily basis and more than once during the course of the day.

'Your actions meant that it was not the care home which lost money but the state.'

Judge Peter Davies

'There was a time when she offered him money to put railings around his house and there were times when he took advantage of the situation he found himself in, taking between £44,000 and £54,000 over a period of two and a half years.'

The court heard that Shonn had little or no assets and was unemployed and on receipt of benefits.

There was said to be a time when his father was alive that there had been a certain 'fluidity' of monies and Shonn when living in Israel had given his father a significant amount of money, around £10,000.

Mr Callery added: 'There was a relaxed attitude to money but he clearly took advantage of that relaxed attitude and he assumed ownership of it.

'His attitude would have been 'well my mother would have not minded' and if she was lucid and able to say properly 'you can have this', she probably would have done but that is not the point he was vested with looking after the money. He is from a devout Jewish family and he is thoroughly ashamed.'

Shonn was ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work within 12 months and abide by a curfew for a period of six months between 8pm and 7am. He was also given a 21 month jail sentence suspended for two years.

Judge Peter Davies told him: 'You were in a high degree of trust, you were your mothers power of attorney.

'Yet you stolen for your own benefit and that of your family. Money was spent of luxurious items, items of electrical significance, home improvement, clothing and meals.

'That money was used to supplement your lifestyle when money was tight. This was a grave offence, however you are the only family member who cares for your mother and that is to your credit.

'You continue to look after your mother as she endures this dreadful condition. Your actions meant that it was not the care home which lost money but the state.

'I have to think what is the public benefit, you are unlikely to commit further offences, you are not a danger.

'Your mother may not know what was going on and looks forward to your visits and I would not wish to deprive her of that.'
