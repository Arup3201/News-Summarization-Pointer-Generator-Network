A veteran of the D-Day landings has finally been honoured for his bravery, receiving six campaign medals 64 years after they were lost in the post.

George Edwin Williams, 91, a former chief petty officer in the Royal Navy, served on a minesweeper at the Normandy landings.

Enjoying hearing tales of his father's time serving in the war, the 91-year-old's son Stephen always questioned why his father had not received any medals.

Honoured: War veteran George Edwin Williams has finally been honoured after six campaign medals marking his courage and bravery, serving in the D-Day landings, were lost in the post

Service: Mr Williams served as a chief petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and saw service in the Atlantic and Pacific. He served on a minesweeper during the Normandy D-Day landings in June 1944

After some research the solicitor discovered his father's bravery and courage should have been rewarded with six campaign medals.

The Ministry of Defence had issued the honours in July 1950, but Mr Williams said they had never arrived at the family's home in East Ham, London.

His son wrote to the MoD and was thrilled when officials agreed to reissue his father's medals.

Mr Williams was presented with the honours during a surprise visit to the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, near Ipswich in Suffolk.

Captain Warren Bairstow CSC RAN, naval advisor to the Australian High Commission, pinned the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star, the Pacific Star, the France and Germany Clasp, the War Medal 1939/45 and the Defence Medal on his chest.

Mr Williams, of East Bergholt, Suffolk, said: 'It is amazing what you can find on the internet. He gave me the name of his ship and I managed to look up the ship's log.

'It confirmed all the stories he used to tell me and my brother when we were children.

't's a kind of closure. It's nice to honour people of that era. No matter how small their stature they were giants among men. How many of us could imagine doing it now?'

His father, who now lives in Rayleigh, Essex, said: 'It's fantastic. I felt very proud. I will be telling more stories.'

The veteran served on HMS Selkirk and the aircraft carrier HMS Vengeance.

D-Day: Mr Williams was on board a minesweeper on the day of the Normandy landings in June 1944. Around 160,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches in northern France at the start of a campaign to drive German forces from France. The landings ultimately led to the defeat of the Nazis

There was an initial airbourne assault with 24,000 being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn.

British troops were dropped off on Gold and Sword beaches while their U.S. and Canadian comrades were tasked with taking Utah, Omaha and Juno beaches.

Thousands of paratroopers and glider-borne troops were dropped in by planes behind enemy lines.

Around 1,300 RAF planes were involved in the assault codenamed Operation Neptune, which started shortly after midnight under the command of General Bernard Montgomery.

More than 7,000 ships and thousands of smaller vessels crossed the channel.

The Normandy landings marked the beginning of Operation Overlord - the invasion of German-occupied Europe.

Originally planned to take place on May 1, 1944, Operation Neptune was postponed for a month to allow time for the Allies to gather more troops and supplies.

The timing was vital. The troops needed the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions to give the mission every chance of success.

A deception plan - Operation Fortitude - was formed to ensure the destination of the landings was kept a secret.

The false plan highlighted Pas de Calais, much further east than the real target, as the drop spot.

When the landings began there were 14 of the 58 German divisions in France to face the Allied onslaught.

While
 there was resistance at other beaches, the most staunch fight back came
 at Omaha - the only beach where the success of the Allied mission was 
in doubt.

The Normandy 
landings represent the largest amphibious assault ever launched. It 
involved five army divisions and more than 7,000 ships as well as 11,000
 aircraft.

In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. Another 23,400 were landed by air.

Within
 five days the Allied troops had secured the Contentin Peninsula beyond 
Cherbourg, but they faced fierce resistance from the Germans.

The end of the Normandy campaign came when the German 7th Army were defeated in the Falaise pocket in August.
