A former waitress at the infamous Heart Attack Grill - the restaurant known for serving 'food that kills people' - has revealed she was allegedly told to film a customer who had passed out so the video could be sent to the media.

Lifting the lid on what she calls the 'unprofessional', 'chaotic' and 'terribly depressing' Las Vegas chain which offers a 9,982-calorie Quadruple Bypass Burger and serves patrons over 350 pounds for free, the unidentified ex-hostess blasted the Grill in a question and answer session online yesterday.

Nothing was off-limits as the waitress attacked the skimpy nurse uniform she was made to wear, how she recoiled at creepy customers who looked forward to a spanking with a paddle for not finishing their meal and how the urinals are covered in pictures of pointing women making fun of over-fed customer's manhood's.

Describing the food at the restaurant, which holds the Guinness world record for the 'most calorific burger', as 'disgusting', the unidentified hostess, who admitted she was a vegan took to social media sharing website, Reddit, to air her grievances.

The former waitresses name was not offered up in the 'Ask Me Anything' session, but she provided photos of herself as proof of her employment, which have since been removed.

In the tell-all post, the lady claimed that in the summer of 2012 she was told by her manager that day to record a video of a customer who had passed out trying to fill his stomach with the enormous burgers served at the Heart Attack Grill.

'At one point, the man passed out. I heard him knock onto the hard ground. We had to call an ambulance. A manager made me take out my cell phone to record a video of the whole thing, so they could send it to the media,' wrote the hostess on Reddit.

'It was on a Friday afternoon, and he hoped it would make the news so they could have a busy weekend. The food may or may not have been responsible for what happened to that man.'

This is the latest of many incidences for the notorious Las Vegas restaurant.

Just last week, Jon Basso, the founder and owner of Heart Attack Grill appeared on Bloomberg Television and unapologetically told viewers that his food causes people to die.

'I am probably the only restaurateur in the entire world who is unapologetically telling you that my food is bad for you, that it will kill you and that you should stay away from it,' he said.

In the disturbing interview, the fast-food supremo produced a clear plastic bad filled with a suspicious powder like substance and declared, 'I'm here with the cremated remains of someone who died at my restaurant.

'He died of a heart attack at my restaurant, and I'm putting the bag clearly on the table. I wish that Burger King, McDonalds, and everyone else would do the same thing.'

Danger: The owner said he discourages people from visiting the restaurant more than once a month

The disgruntled former hostess exposed the seedy goings-on inside the restaurant, which started life in Chandler, Arizona, just outside Phoenix.

Describing the practice of spanking customer's who fail to finish their gargantuan meals, the waitress was ambivalent.

'It depended on who was doing spanking,' said the ex-hostess.

'Some girls were rough and put all their strength into it. I was a weakling and would lightly tap, because I also have terrible coordination and was scared I would miss and actually hurt someone.

'Also, we'd go lighter on females.'

Inside the restaurant, which is designed to resemble a hospital, the waitresses wear sexy nurses uniforms, administering food as 'prescriptions' and customers who weigh over 350 pounds are able to eat for free.

'There is a scale in the middle of the restaurant where customer's are weighted,' said the hostess.

'If they pass, the scale lights up and people applaud.'

Indeed, she reserved some of her deepest scorn for these free-loaders and claims there is a hardcore of regulars who eat almost daily for free.

'We'd get a few locals who would come in frequently to take advantage of the free meal. Most of them will come in, not get a drink, and not leave a tip. So that they could literally have a free meal,' said the waitress.

The waitress also spoke about how condescending she felt the customers to the Las Vegas restaurant were.

'People would always talk down to us employees as well, because 1. Our uniforms were provocative, therefore in their minds we were all brainless and 2. How we are the immoral ones for serving them that food. Because it's not like people have freedom of choice when it comes to their eating habits.'

Explaining that staff are paid $11 an hour plus tips, the poster claimed that on a good night she could make up to $300.

Hitting back in an emailed statement to the Huffington Post, Heart Attack Grill founder Jon Basso identified the former employee and described her as 'attention seeking.'

'She had a pathetic work ethic, never made friends with her co-workers, and was continually reprimanded for cell texting friends, and we received continual costumer compliant about her poor attitude,' he added.

Despite this, the scathing attack caught the attention of Reddit users.

'What was it like being surrounded by the fall of western civilization?' one Redditor asked the former hostess.

'It was terribly depressing,' she responded. 'Everyday we would have 5-10 people come in who actually qualify for the free meal. And that's when I would feel bad about contributing to their bad health.'

The restaurant chain - founded in 2005 using the catchphrase 'Taste Worth Dying For!' - is run by a former nutritionist 'Doctor' Jon Basso who, remarkably, used to run a Jenny Craig weight loss diet centre.

Meals can exceed 8,000 calories. The recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men.

The Triple Bypass Burger contains three slabs of meat, 12 rashes of bacon, cheese, red onion, sliced tomato and the Heart Attack Grill's own 'unique special sauce'.

And that's before taking into account the accompanying 'Flatliner Fries', cooked in pure lard, and a giant soft drink.

A sign at the entrance to an Arizona branch of the restaurant chain reads: 'Go away. If you come in this place, it’s going to kill you.'

But the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers.

In February, the nofficial spokesman for the Heart Attack Grill restaurant in Las Vegas - which prides itself on 'taste worth dying for' - died of a heart attack at the age of 52.

The owner of the hospital-themed restaurant, 'Doctor Jon' Basso told the Las Vegas Sun: 'I told him if you keep eating like this, it's going to kill ya.

'He'd say, "I just love your place, Jon." He's the only person I know who was probably at the restaurant more than I.'

Alleman is the second Heart Attack Grill spokesman to die; in March 2011, 29-year-old Blair River passed away.

At the time, Basso said River had succumbed to flu-related pneumonia.

The following year, a customer suffered a heart attack while eating a triple bypass burger in the restaurant, and two months later, a customer collapsed while eating a double bypass burger.

Speaking to Eater Vegas last year, Basso said his business was 'absolutely honest' and said he warned people against going to the restaurant more than once a month.

'I say it right in the door, "Caution this establishment is bad for your health', he said.
