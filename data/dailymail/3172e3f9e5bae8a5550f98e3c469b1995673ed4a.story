A man accused of having sex with his teenage foster daughter was convicted today of conspiring with her to kill his wife.

Prosecutors told jurors that Kevin Knoefel, 43, showed his foster daughter Sabrina Zunich how to stab his wife and that he wanted her out of the picture but was afraid he'd lose custody of their 3-year-old daughter if they divorced. Zunich then allegedly stabbed Lisa Knoefel to death in her bed.

A Lake County jury convicted Knoefel on six counts of sexual battery, three counts of complicity to aggravated murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.

Guilty: Kevin Knoefel is led out of Lake County Common Pleas Court on June 11, 2014, after a jury found him guilty of all 11 charges including conspiracy to commit aggravated murder

The father appeared emotionless as he was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom by police officers, according to The News-Herald. 

Knoefel, who plans to appeal, could face 25 years to life in prison.

Zunich,
 now 19, testified last week that she put on a ski mask and fatally 
stabbed 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel in her bed as she fought back in 
November 2012, when she was 17.

Prosecutors said Zunich stabbed and cut her more than 150 times with the 10-inch serrated knife.

Zunich
 said she had fallen in love with her foster father and feared he would 
commit suicide if she didn't carry out their plot to kill his wife.

Knoefel picked out the knife and showed her how to plunge it in once and twist, she said.

She hid the weapon under her bedroom dresser in the home in Willoughby Hills, west of Cleveland.

She
 said they were carrying on a sexual relationship and discussed several 
plans to kill Lisa Knoefel, including shooting her and making it look 
like a burglary, or finding a hit man.

Knoefel finally suggested that Zunich stab his wife, she said.

Defense attorney Michael Connick said that Zunich was mentally ill and acted alone.

He said she was upset because the Knoefels had told her she would need to move out before her high school graduation.

Zunich said she reached an agreement to testify against Knoefel in exchange for a sentence of life in prison with the chance for parole in 30 years.

Zunich was arrested the night of the slaying.

Police said they found Zunich in the house covered with blood and holding a knife after getting a 911 call from a 13-year-old girl screaming that her sister had a knife and was attacking her mother.
