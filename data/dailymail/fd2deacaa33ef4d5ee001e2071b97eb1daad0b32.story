A tragic photo of the family that perished in a horrific Christmas Day fire shows a happy father with his three daughters smiling and laughing in front of the Statue of Liberty days before the girls and their grandparents were killed.

Matthew Badger is seen holding the family dog - a tiny poodle named Pippi - surrounded by his three beautiful daughters, Lily, 10, and seven-year-old twins Sarah and Grace.

All of them look cheerful and excited for upcoming holiday as they smiled for the camera, but four days later, the only person in the photograph who would be alive is Mr Badger.

House of horror: Madonna Badger's home as it is demolished. Fire fighters were unable to save her three daughters and their grandparents from the flames

Homeowner Madonna Badger, 45, and her boyfriend Michael Borcina, 52, survived the blaze of her upscale Connecticut home.

Ms Badger’s parents, Lomer Johnson, 71, and his wife Pauline, 69, perished, as did her three daughters.

Mr and Ms Badger are divorcing, and Mr Badger was not in the home at the time of the fire.

The victims died from smoke inhalation, except for Mr Johnson, who fell through the roof as he tried to rescue one of his granddaughters.

A funeral service will be held in New York next week for three girls. Dominic Carella, vice president of the Frank Campbell Funeral Home, says a private wake will be held Wednesday at the funeral home in Manhattan.

A funeral service open to the public will be held at 10.30am Thursday at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Manhattan for ten-year-old Lily Badger and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger.

A private service will be held at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx for all five victims.

Ms Carella says funeral plans for the grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, are still being worked on.

Authorities say embers in a bag of discarded fireplace ashes started the blaze.

Eerie: Neighbours look on as Madonna Badger's home is demolished. Fire fighters were unable to save her three daughters and their grandparents from the Christmas Day blaze

Their unwavering 
voices show the solid determination among the 46 fire fighters 
dispatched to the Stamford, Connecticut home to quell the flames 
ravaging the Victorian mansion.

Despite
arriving on the scene just six minutes after neighbours desperately 
called 911, firemen were able to save just two of the home's seven 
residents.

The eerie fire service recordings track the escalating danger and fear as the house burned to the ground.

‘We got victims trapped on the second floor,’ one fireman says.

‘We're going to rescue mode with the ladder ... heavy fire in the back of the building. We got a report from one of the victims there's people in that window.'

‘All right, but we're gonna need some protection up here, we got to get this line here. We can't stay here,’ another tells a supervisor, who responds: ‘I hear ya, but we got to get in there though.’

Grief: Friends and neighbours pay their respects and leave bouquets and cards outside the destroyed house

Pain: Firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respects outside the destroyed home in Stamford, Connecticut. Many of the fire fighters dispatched to the scene are undergoing counseling to deal with the horrifying memories

But later, a fire official is heard calling off the search to protect the crew.

‘Unit four, be advised number one floor looking up the two floors are compromised right through.’The deputy chief adds: ‘All units inside, back out! back out!’

A number of the fire fights have undergone counselling after the horrific event. Some told NBC News they are unable to stop thinking about what they saw.

Assistant Fire Chief Peter Brown, who has worked with the department for 25 years, told the New York Daily News: 'The one thing they can't get out of their minds is her screaming. That voice will stay with them for as long as they live.'

Floral bouquets, stuffed animals, and
candles have been left outside the now torn-down home by 
passers-by and others wishing to express their condolences.

Victims: Lomer and Pauline Johnson and their grandchildren, from left, Lily, Grace, Sarah and Morgan - who was not in the house - perished in the 5 a.m. fire

Bereaved: Madonna Badger's estranged husband Matthew Badger, pictured, was the father of the three children who died in the fire. He was in New York at the time of the tragedy

Stamford fire officials said Tuesday that embers in a bag of discarded 
fireplace ashes started the fire

The
house should not have even been occupied, fire and city officials have 
said, as fire alarms did not appear to have been activated, and the 
property did not have an inspection certificate.

Mr
Borcina had tried to take the girls downstairs to safety but, in panic,
they fled from the flames upstairs, where they perished.

Two of the girls were found on the 
second floor; their other sister died just feet from escaping through a window.

Mr Johnson had tried to save one of his granddaughters, but fell through the weakened roof and died.

As Mrs Badger was taken away by fire fighters, witnesses heard her say: 'My whole life is in there.'

Fashion executive Michelle Kessler-Sanders, one of Madonna Badger's closest friends, said the bereaved mother was comforted by her close circle of friends from the industry.

Remembered: Stamford firefighters lay a wreath in a memorial area outside Madonna Badger's home

Gone: The house, which was built in the 1890s, has been entirely demolished

'It's so awful,' Kessler-Sanders said.
'But here's what I know about Madonna Badger: she is the strongest 
woman I've ever known in my life, throughout our 20-year friendship.

'There has been an enormous outpouring for Madonna. You can't possibly 
say anything to comfort a person in this time.

Loss: Lomer Johnson, pictured with his wife and granddaughters at a previous Christmas, worked as a Saks Fifth Avenue Santa on his final day alive

'You just have to be there
and sit with her. Be there so she knows she's not alone.

'She is being cared for by the right people, close friends. She is not alone.'

Mrs Badger's boyfriend, 
Mr Borcina, also uttered words of hope before he left the hospital where he 
was being treated for smoke inhalation.

'We’re going to be OK,' the contractor, 52, said. 'We’re just trying to stay positive.'

Campbell Badger said his brother 
Matthew Badger was devoted to his three daughters and added that the family is 
appreciative of the outpouring of public sympathy.

‘Matthew is devastated,’ Mr Badger 
told the Associated Press Wednesday. ‘He’s doing as best as can be 
expected under the circumstances.’

Family members have also paid tribute to the Johnsons, who would have celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on Monday.

Mr Johnson had worked in his 'dream job' as a Saks Fifth Avenue Santa Claus the day before he died.

'That’s all he ever wanted to be,' a family member told the New York Times. 'He stopped shaving the day he retired.'

'It
is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford,' Mayor Michael 
Pavia told reporters at a news briefing at the scene of the fire.

'There probably has not been a worse Christmas day in the city of Stamford.'

Funeral services for the five victims will be held in New York City next week. A service is planned at the Campbell Funeral Chapel on the Upper East Side, Manhattan.

Tragic: Embers in a bag of discarded fireplace ashes put outside the house started the fire, officials said

Fire: A neighbour was woken up in the early hours by screaming and saw the house was engulfed in flames
