Colonel Gaddafi was good for immigration control as he helped stop North Africans coming to Britain, Ukip candidate Mark Reckless has said.

The former MP, who defected from the Tories triggering the by-election in Rochester, said the former Libyan leader had stopped boats taking migrants across the Mediterranean to Italy.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage agreed with the comments and said the dictator, accused of killing hundreds of his own people, brought ‘stability’ to the country. He claimed helping remove Gaddafi was one of David Cameron’s biggest mistakes .

Gaddafi fan:  Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip in September, spoke out in support of the late Libyan dictator, saying Colonel Gaddafi was good for immigration control

At a rally in the Kent constituency, Mr Reckless said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn’t allow those boats to come across.

‘He had an agreement with Italy that stopped it. Since he’s gone we’ve no idea what’s going on in Libya, it’s too dangerous for anyone to go there.’

Asked if he agreed, Mr Farage replied: ‘Of course.’ The Ukip leader insisted that the ‘bad guys’ were being replaced by ‘even worse guys’ and said action in Libya had been Mr Cameron’s biggest mistakes.

He added: ‘We bombed them, that’s what we did. That’s how this government helped Libya. It got rid of somebody, albeit an Arab nationalist dictator, who actually gave a level of stability to the area.’

Mr Reckless’ remarks were compared to the famous last excuse for Facism, ‘say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains on time.’

'Oh, Reckless': Ukip leader Farage did not seem at all unhappy with Mark Reckless' support of the Colonel, and agreed with his new candidate, saying removing Gaddafi was one of David Cameron’s biggest mistakes

Shaking hands with the devil: Mr Reckless said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn’t allow those boats to come across'

Labour MP Chris Bryant said last night said: ‘First Farage says he admires Putin, then Reckless praises Gaddafi. Why don’t they go the whole way and say they support Kim Il Sung, Genghis Khan and Stalin and be done with it?’

Colonel Gaddafi died after the UN security council approved bombing raids led by Britain, France and the U.S. designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to Gaddafi on the ground.

He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011.

During his rule his government supplied weapons to the IRA and other terrorist groups, was behind the Lockerbie bombing – the biggest act of terrorism in Britain history, which killed 270 people in 1988 – and the 1984 murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher.

Tens of thousands of migrants each year cross from North Africa to Europe, many in dangerous wooden baots.

Last October 359 people were killed when a boat making the crossing sank off the Italian island Lampedusa.

Senior Tories had declared the Rochester and Strood by-election on November 20 a ‘must-win’, but‎ Mr Reckless has a 15 point lead over his former party according to the latest opinion poll.

Mr Cameron had pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat and halt the Ukip surge.

There are warnings that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win.

Former leadership contender David Davis was last week reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose Mr Cameron if the seat is lost.

Mr Davis is said to have told fellow MPs that there is a ‘window’ of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron between the by-election and Christmas.

The contest comes after Douglas Carswell became the first elected Ukip MP last month.
