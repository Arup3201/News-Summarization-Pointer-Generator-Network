Art experts at a Romanian museum are analysing ashes found in a stove to see if they are the remains of seven paintings by Monet, Picasso and others said to be worth around £100million that were stolen in a brazen heist last year.

Romania's Natural History Museum is looking at the ashes after Olga Dogaru, the mother of one of three Romanian suspects charged with stealing the artworks from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam, claimed that she burned the paintings in her oven.

Prosecutors claim that Ms Dogaru feared for her son Radu when he was arrested in January following the early morning raid last October.

Ms Dogaru claims that she buried the art in an abandoned house and dug them up a month later before burning them when detectives began searching the village for them.

Prosecution spokesman Gabriela Chiru said that the authorities did not necessarily believe Ms Dogaru's claims and added that it could be months before test results are conclusive.

Thieves managed to bypass the sophisticated alarm system, in what police say was a well-prepared 3am robbery at the Kunsthal last autumn.

The seven paintings stolen were Monet’s Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow (1919)  and Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002), Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890).

The theft was one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years and one of the biggest ever to take place in the Netherlands.

The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde collection for the first time in one gallery, opened just a few days before the heist to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary.

The Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August Rodin, and Andy Warhol.

The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent collection of its own.

The collection was put together by the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to Dutch media.

Radu Dogaru, the alleged ringleader, as well as the two other suspects remain in custody as investigators seek the paintings and other evidence.
