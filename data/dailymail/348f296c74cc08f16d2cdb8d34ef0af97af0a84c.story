Heroes of Bomber Command face losing their homes to pay for the unveiling of a £6.5million memorial dedicated to the sacrifice of thousands of their comrades,

There is a £550,000 shortfall for the cost of staging the event, attended by the Queen, which David Cameron has refused to meet from official funds.

In a letter sent to the Bomber Command Association yesterday, the Prime Minister said the Government ‘does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials’.

Worrying: War heroes face losing their homes to pay for the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial in London's Green Park because the Government is refusing to make up a £550,000 shortfall

The decision means trustees of the 
charity will be legally  liable to foot the bill. Hard-pressed veterans 
are now scrambling to raise money as invoices arrive.

Association chairman Air Commodore Malcolm White said ministers ‘could and should have done more’.

Survivors had to raise the money to 
build their own monument to recognise the sacrifice and courage of their
lost comrades. Bomber Command suffered the highest casualty rate of any
British unit in the Second World War, losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men.

In 1940, Winston Churchill praised it 
as Britain’s ‘salvation’. But amid public disquiet at the controversial 
tactic of carpet-bombing German  cities, he snubbed the airmen in his 
1945 victory broadcast.

Expense: Trustees of the Bomber Command Association will be legally liable to foot the bill for the major event in June, attended by 13 members of the Royal Family, if they cannot raise the money

In June, the sculpture depicting a 
crew returning from a mission was unveiled by the Queen in Green Park, 
central London, in front of more than 6,500 veterans and widows.

The final cost of the ceremony, 
including seating, security, insurance and catering, was £827,000. The 
association has received £270,000 in donations, including £200,000 from 
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

But the Ministry of Defence reneged on a pledge to match DCMS funding.

The pensioners fear they will be forced to sell their homes to meet the six-figure shortfall.

Former rear gunner Harry Irons, 88, of
Romford, Essex, who survived 60 missions, said: ‘I do not know where we
are going to get the money from. There’s talk that we could lose our 
houses.

‘We are very bitter. The MoD was happy enough to send us to war. The Government has a moral responsibility to step in.'

He added: ‘They gave us nothing after the war. 
They were embarrassed about what we did to Germany. But if we hadn’t 
done it to them, they would have done it to us.

‘I saw what our boys went through. It was horrendous.’

Jim Dooley, chairman of the Bomber 
Command Memorial Campaign, said: ‘These guys are heroes – they saved the
world from Hitler. They don’t deserve the anxiety of possibly having to
sell their homes to fund this memorial.

‘They played a huge part in ensuring 
we remained free yet they have been neglected for decades. Next year is 
70 years since the Dambusters raised the morale of this country with 
their daring skill and sacrifice.

‘The Government should do the right thing. Not to do so would be a gross insult.’

Yesterday a Number 10 spokesman said 
there had been official help as £1million was waived in VAT on building 
the memorial and the cost of providing RAF personnel and aircraft for 
the ceremony was the equivalent of £375,000.
