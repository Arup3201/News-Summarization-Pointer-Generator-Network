Dramatic new video has emerged showing Oscar Pistorius shooting a melon with the same type of gun that killed his girlfriend just months before her death.

The footage of the double amputee athlete on a firing range was released three days before the he is due to face trial for Reeva Steenkamp's murder.

Sky News broadcast the video which shows Pistorius firing a pistol to shoot a watermelon, which bursts on impact, as well as a shotgun.

New footage: This still from dramatic video shows Oscar Pistorius firing a shotgun at a weapons range months before shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year

The broadcaster also published a 
series of photographs showing the Paralympian firing the same silver 9mm
 pistol he used when he killed Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last 
year.

In the video, 
delighted screams and laughter from unidentified people are heard in the
 background as Pistorius fires the weapons.

Sky News also broadcast audio of a man it says 'sounds very much' like Pistorius who comments on the shattered watermelon.

'It's a lot softer than brain but... it's like a zombie stopper,' the man said.

Accused: The footage has emerged just three days before the double amputee athlete is due to face trial for the murder of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (pictured)

Evidence: A police officer holds the pistol that was allegedly used in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp

The video of Pistorius shows him wearing sunglasses and gun range headphones.

Francois Hougaard, a South African international rugby player, is also seen shooting alongside Pistorius.

Sky News did not say exactly when the video was taken, or where.

Pistorius's murder trial starts on Monday.

The prosecution says he had a fight with Reena Steenkamp before killing her by firing shots through a door in the bathroom of his home on February 14 last year.

He says he shot the model and reality TV star after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder in the night.

Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for Pistorius should he be convicted of murder, meaning the Olympic runner would have to serve at least 25 years in prison before being eligible for parole. There is no death penalty in South Africa.
