Samir Nasri may secretly be wishing he was back in France's World Cup squad when he blows out his candles after Didier Deschamp's men cruised into the final 16.

But the Manchester City midfielder certainly didn't look too bothered having to make do with his model girlfriend Anara Atanes at his birthday bash.

Atanes took to social media to post a picture of the pair as Nasri turned 27, and his Sky Blue employers didn't forget to wish him all the best either.

Nasri was controversially snubbed from France's World Cup squad, after manager Deschamps claimed the midfielder didn't take well to sitting on the bench.

What happened next, though, was even more controversial as Atanes took to Twitter to launch a foul-mouthed rant against Deschamps and the France team.

She posted: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!'

To reiterate her point further, the 
British model then tweeted: 'Incase u didnt read my tweet properly.... 
Ill repeat myself..... f*** FRANCE!!!!! And f*** Deschamps!'

Atanes has since set her account to private after it caused a stir with Deschamps, who immediately threatened legal action.
