A pageant queen and self-ascribed 'beauty guru' has sent shock waves through the internet by posting a startling video in which she addresses her rapist father and threatens him with three guns.

Brie Lybrand put up a twelve minute piece in which she explains that her abusive father has recently subscribed to her channel and tells him 'now is the time' for her to speak out about his crimes.

Calling the post, a 'different kind of video' than normal, the Lousiana native launches into a harrowing attack on a Steven Bressler, the father she says sexually abused her from the age of four to 13.

Watch out: New Orleans 'beauty guru' Brie Lybrand normally posts videos about her makeup and shopping but her latest is a shocking attack directed at an abusive father she says raped and tortured her for nine years

Ms Lybrand, whose normally upbeat videos are watched by over 2,000 viewers and contain tips on beauty brands and shopping advice,  appears in the video without even a hint of the makeup so immaculately applied in previous posts, looking tired and vulnerable.

'My zombie eyes are in full affect,' she half-quips mustering the effort to laugh at herself through tears before explaining the motive behind her post.

'I just got an email from You Tube 
saying the man that raped me for most of my life subscribed to me. The 
man that took my virginity, robbed me of innocence, has subscribed to me
 on You Tube and is watching my videos.'

'I
 never got to testify in court and tell him what it feels like being 
tied up and chained and tortured for hours when you're four years old by
 your father,' she continues.

Trauma: The usually perfectly made-up former pageant queen and actress appears bare faced and teary as she explains that the man who repeatedly raped her recently subscribed to her popular You Tube channel

Unforgiving: Ms Lybrand tells him that 'now is the time' for her to speak out about the unspeakable things he did to her as a child which she claims she never got to tell to a court

According to the statement, her father not only forced himself on her but tried to kill her mother, Ron Lybrand, 'many times'.

One account recalls a night on which he beat 'the teeth out of' her for trying to protect her daughter.

'I watched my mother in a pool of her own blood and then he came after me,' she says. 'Even at my age I still have nightmares that he's coming back to kill me.'

Though Ms Lybrand tells her viewers that she got away from him at 13, how she managed to do this is unclear as she still lives in the city in which she grew up.

A lifelong resident of New Orleans, Ms Lybrand's own website exclaims proudly: 'I was born and raised in the "Crescent City" also known as "The Big Easy," New Orleans and am proud to call it home!'

Remaining in New Orleans for college, the bit-part actress attended Tulane University in the city where she graduated with a degree in Theatre and History and though now she spends a significant amount of time sharing her secrets on You Tube, according to her latest post she also teaches children.

'You wanna see what kind of person I 
turned out to be?' She challenges her father before the video cuts to a 
new shot and she lists her achievements as cheer-leading captain at high
 school and college graduate.

Her choice to become an actor is one, she explains, chillingly, that she credits to him.

'I think I became an actor because I had to escape my reality. The reality of the tortures of what you did. I got really good at it. I got really good at pretending I was somewhere else. Steven Bressler, when you were raping me my mind was somewhere else.

'I was in Disney World, or I was on a beach. Or on a swing listening to Broadway musicals. But I was anywhere except you on top of me. And I have turned that into my career.'

Switching the subject, Ms Lybrand 
then goes on to ask how he managed to get someone to marry him and calls
 his new wife by her name.

How she knows this information is unclear but she
 refers to a lady named Suz and then claims her real name is Glenda.

Perhaps
 the most shocking act in the beauty queen's story is at five minutes 
when she introduces her father to a substantial arsenal of weapons.

Ms Lybrand shows viewers three handguns, one by one and tells her father she is always prepared for him.

'Let me show you my friends,' she says before drawing an automatic pistol from a baby pink carry case. She then shows a smaller version that she carries in her purse. And finally a third, pink gun that proves is loaded by opening the barrel.

'Even though I will be forever 
damaged because of you, you haven't gotten the best of me... I met a 
wonderful man who understands, who is there when I have to cry and when I
 have to be upset on father's day when I didn't have a father. I had a 
monster. I had a murderer.'

The
 man she talks about is Nick Rohde who appears in a couple of wedding 
photographs on her Facebook page and yet who she refers to later in the 
video as her fiance.

Snap! Mr Lybrand's fans love the way she shoots her video from the comfort of her own home making the posts personal and cute

'I wish for your death every day,' she begins to conclude. 'You don't deserve to breathe the same air that I breathe. When you die, I will find your grave and I'm going to take a big, heaping dump on it because that's what you deserve.'

The actress then suppresses a smile and wipes her face before continuing.

'I hope you see my face every day for the rest of your miserable life,' she says before urging him to unsubscribe from her channel. 'In the end you're going to be punished and I can't wait. Until then, stay out of my way.'

Gawker has pointed to opinions that the story may have been made given Ms Lybrand's penchant for acting but others have argued that she has too much of web presence to fabricate something so serious.
