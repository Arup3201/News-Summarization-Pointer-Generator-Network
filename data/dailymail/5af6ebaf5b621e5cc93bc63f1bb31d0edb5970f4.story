An emotional mother who lost her son serving in Afghanistan was today able to thank Prince Harry in person for the 'beautiful' letter he wrote her after he died.

Cheryl Routledge's son, Corporal Liam Riley, was just 21 when he was killed by an IED whilst serving with the Coldstream Guards Battle Group in 2010.

The characterful 3rd Battalion Yorkshire regiment soldier, known for his cheeky sense of humour and ever-present smile, had trained with Prince Harry in Canada in 2007 when he was in the Blues and Royals and preparing for the frontline.

Although they had not met since, the pair were said to have bonded during their three month posting.

Liam, was killed in February 2010 after trying to rescue a colleague who had also stepped on an IED during a patrol near Gereshk.

He was second in command of a base security foot patrol when the device was detonated, leaving him with catastrophic injuries.

His funeral in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside.

In the aftermath of his death, as Mrs Routledge struggled to cope with her grief, she was comforted by a letter written by Harry personally.

She has chosen not to make the contents public out of respect for the prince but said today: 'Harry said that although they had not known each other for long, some three months or so, he knew instantly that Liam was 'a legend' and what a great bloke he was. They said some fantastic times together in Canada.

'He told me that he had an unforgettable smile, in fact he said he never stopped smiling the whole time he knew him.

'He talked to me about the pain he felt after his own mother died and how he came to terms with his grief.

'It was a beautiful letter, written from the heart, and something that touched me and brought me enormous comfort at the time. It is something I will always treasure.'

Mrs Routledge was first introduced to Harry's father, Prince Charles, at a reception at London's Guildhall today following the service of commemoration for those who had served in Afghanistan at St Paul's Cathedral.

Charles's eye was drawn not only to Liam's medals that she was wearing, but a badge showing the smiling soldier on his mother's lapel.

When Mrs Routledge, 50, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, explained her son's link to Harry, Charles rubbed her affectionately on the arm.

The mother-of-three said afterwards: ‘Liam was always very discreet about the time he served with Prince Harry but did tell me that when Harry celebrated his birthday out in Canada, Prince Charles sent him a cake and he shared it with them all.

‘Prince Charles was very sympathetic and asked me about Liam. He appeared very touched to hear about the time he had spent with his son.’

When royal officials became aware that Liam had been known to Harry personally, they arranged for his mother and grandmother, Grace Davison, 73, to meet with the prince in another room at the reception where he was greeting serving soldiers.

‘How did you find me down here?’ the prince said in shock as he hugged Mrs Routledge and her mother, before posing for pictures.

‘It is very good to meet you at last. When I said Liam was a legend, I meant it.’

Afterwards Mrs Routledge said the meeting had meant a great deal to her.

‘I just wanted to be able to thank him for what he said about Liam. His words were a huge comfort to us all at a very difficult time,’ she said.

Ironically for his family, Liam hadn’t been due for a tour of duty in Afghanistan but had pestered his superiors for the chance to be sent there as he ‘didn’t feel worthy of his rank’ without having served in a warzone.

‘He took to the army like a duck to water and was flying up the ranks,’ his mother recalled.

‘There was nothing I could have done to stop him, he was doing what he loved. Like all of these parents here you just have to kiss them goodbye and keep your fingers’ crossed. Sadly for us we were one of those who received a knock on the door.’

In all there were close to a thousand family members and servicemen present at the reception, held by the City of London, at which the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent were also present along with Prime Minister David Cameron.

The family of Royal Marine Steven Birdsall, who died at the age of just 20 after being shot by a sniper as he worked in a military compound in Sangin, were also introduced to Charles.

Marine Birsdall, of 40 Commando, was seriously injured in June 2010 and immediately flown back to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but died the following day from his wounds.

The death of the ‘brave and selfless’ soldier from Warrington, left his family in deep shock.

His mother, Jenny, described today’s event as a ‘very fitting memorial’.

‘We will never forget Steven and still have our good and bad days,’ she said.

‘He was only two and a half years out of his training but he loved what he was doing. He was very selfless, brave and fearless.

‘It has been a long and difficult road even getting to the point that we can talk about what has happened so publically.

‘But Prince Charles was wonderful. He was hugely sympathetic. He told me how much Prince Harry had loved his service in Afghanistan and would have gone out there in a heartbeat again if he had been able to.

‘It meant a great deal to us to be able to share Steven’s story with him.’

In a short speech before the reception, The Lord Mayor of London, Alan Yarrow, said it was impossible for anyone to imagine what the families of those who lost loved ones in Afghanistan had lived through in order to get to this day.

‘But we can remember and respect,’ he said.
