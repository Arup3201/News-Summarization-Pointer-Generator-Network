An Ohio mother of three who was found guilty of poisoning her fiancee with antifreeze was sentenced Wednesday sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.

Holly McFeeture, 35, added antifreeze to Matthew Podolak’s raspberry iced tea, which he drank every day, prosecutors said.

Podolak, 31, died in 2006 one day after going to the doctor for lower back pain and getting treated for kidney stones.

The couple had two young children as well as an 8-year-old from one of McFeeture's former relationships.

McFeeture wasn't arrested until 2012, after police were tipped off to her possible involvement in Podolak's death by one of her ex-boyfriends.

Jamison Kennedy, an ex-con, dated McFeeture after her fiancé's death, and testified during the trial that she admitted poisoning Podolak.

Kennedy told police in 2008 that McFeeture 'put something in [Podolak's] drinks and she wanted to stop but his kidneys were already failing.'

It would be two years before then-County Coroner Frank Miller changed his ruling on the manner of Podolak's death from undetermined to homicide, and a further two years before McFeeture was indicted for aggravated murder and contaminating a substance for human consumption or use in 2012.

Matthew Podolak, a Navy veteran, and Holly McFeeture lived together in a two-story home on Archmere Ave in Old Brooklyn, Cleveland.

The prosecution claims that McFeeture spiked a raspberry iced tea drink that Podolak consumed daily with antifreeze over the course of several days or even weeks.

The defense claims that Podolak was depressed and that he committed suicide by poisoning himself.

Each case relies on the testimony of expert witnesses.

For the prosecution, the pathologist who 
made the determination that Podolak died of chronic ingestion of 
ethylene glycol will testify that his diagnosis of 'chronic' ingestion, 
which indicates that the poison was ingested over a period of time, is 
consistent with damage to Podolak's body.

According to Cleveland.com, Dr Dan Galita
testified that damage to Podolak's heart indicated intoxication over 
several weeks. Furthermore, doctor's records show Podolak was suffering 
severe back pain up to three months before he died, a symptom likely 
related to the poison.

The defense argued that Podolak killed himself with antifreeze depends upon discounting Galita's initial autopsy results.

If
Podolak wanted to commit suicide, he would be unlikely to slowly poison
himself, but rather take one large dose of the poison.

Ethylene
glycol, found in antifreeze, is toxic to humans. It creates symptoms 
that can easily be mistake for other illnesses. The poison accumulates 
in the body and causes damage to the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys. 
Death by kidney failure occurs if proper medical attention is not 
sought.

Its sweet taste and the difficulty of detecting it in the body makes antifreeze the poisoner's weapon of choice.

The
jury heard from prosecution witnesses saying Podolak was a fun-loving 
person who rarely drank and loved his kids and fiancée.

ABC reports that friends and family were so concerned about Podolak's volatile relationship with McFeeture that they urged him to change the beneficiary of his life insurance policy from his fiancée to his father.

Podolak refused, and upon his death McFeeture collected his life insurance policy and his 401K - but didn't contribute to any of the costs of her fiancé's funeral.

Podolak's brother, Mark Podolak, told Cleveland.com after McFeeture's 2012 arrest that the family had long suspected she had something to do with Matthew Podolak's death.

'She just wasn't acting like somebody who was losing or about to lose a loved one,' he said.
