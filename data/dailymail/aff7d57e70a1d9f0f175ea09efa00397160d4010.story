'Proud': War veteran Harry Thrush has received a photo from Camp Bastion for his 90th birthday

For the past 10 years, he has travelled around Yorkshire consoling the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

Now, World War Two veteran Harry Thrush has been sent a special present for his 90th birthday.

He has received a photo from Camp Bastion - featuring dozens of British servicemen smiling at the camera in front of the high-profile military base.

It is accompanied by a touching message, wishing pensioner a 'wonderful' birthday and thanking him for his service.

Mr Thrush, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, served as a gunner in Italy during the Second World War.

After signing up to the army aged 18 in 1942, he trained in Yorkshire as part of the 7th Mountain Regiment, before spending eight months on mission in Salerno in Campania, south Italy.

For the past decade, he has taken his legacy seriously by travelling across Yorkshire to attend the funerals of fallen soldiers.

He sits through the services, before meeting the soldiers' families and offering his condolences.

So, when Mr Thrust's landmark birthday approached, his family rallied round and organised the special gift.Â 

They managed to arrange the photo via his son Geoff's partner Joanne Holmes, who worked with trauma surgeon Mansoor Khan - now a surgeon commander with the Royal Navy in Afghanistan.

Today, the veteran said he was 'really proud' to be presented with the photo, featuring 37 British soldiers from the Role 3 Hospital Doctors team.

'All of them are smiling - it's a really good photo,' said Mr Thrust, who was handed the picture during his birthday celebrations at The Old Colonial pub in Mirfield in Kirklees, West Yorkshire.

'I would shake all their hands.'

The photo's accompanying message reads: 'FAO Gunner Thrust, of 7th Mountain Regiment, Salerno war veteran.

'Happy 90th birthday. Have a wonderful birthday night celebration. We and all the trauma team and soldiers out in Afghanistan send our best wishes.

'We have the utmost respect for you and many thanks for your service.

'Best wishes, Role 3 Hospital Doctors, Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.'

'Best wishes, Role 3 Hospital Doctors, Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.'

Mr Thrust's son Geoff said his father had initially been 'overwhelmed' by the gift - adding: 'But he is as proud as punch now'.

Meanwhile, his other son David told how the pensioner is very active for his age and regularly disappears on the bus or train, leaving a note to tell his family where he has gone.

Mr Thrust, one of four brothers who served in the war, sailed from Portsmouth on one of a number of Gibraltar-bound ships during his mission to Italy.

'Two of the ships sunk,' he recalled. 'They were full of troops and no-one could pick them up because they couldn't stop the convoy.

'The survivors in the water were just left to drown - hundreds of people.

'That was a horrible experience. It was frightening as well at that age. You thought you were next. You were expecting this shell to come.'

Finally, after a gruelling trek with mules carrying his guns, Mr Thrust reached the mountainous region of Salerno.

He said the regiment's screw-guns were like 'pea shooters on wheels' as soldiers had to get extremely close to the Germans to use them.

'You could hear them talking,' he said. 'But the Germans were eventually squeezed out of position.

'I'm hoping being so close to them, we made them move.'

The veteran also recalled having to use his jacket as a stretcher when two of his colleagues were fatally injured after a gun blew up.
