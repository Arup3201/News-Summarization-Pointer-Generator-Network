It was a real dog of an afternoon on Sunday for a pet pooch and some local firefighters in St Louis, Missouri.

Doberman pinscher Diablo became stuck in a frozen-over pond near O'Fallon Park for almost half an hour and almost died from the below-zero water temperatures.

He had been chasing geese when he fell through the ice, according to Examiner.

City officials say firefighters responded swiftly to the rescue after worried witnesses called 911 about the floundering dog.

Panic: Firefighters reported it was hard to get Diablo to cooperate because he had been stuck in the water for 25 minutes and was obviously panicking

The dog was continuing to try and get out of the frigid water after its fall, but was unable to do so, trapped roughly 20 yards from the pondâ€™s edge.

Firefighter Demetris Alfred said Diablo was close to death before they reached him.

'He was almost done,' he said.

The rescue proved difficult with Diablo not the most cooperative of victims.

'He kept rolling over and submerging,' said firefighter Stan Baynes.

Coming in: Diablo is finally on land after being stuck in freezing water for half an hour on Sunday in St. Louis

But the brave men from the St. Louis Fire
 Department's Rescue Squad 1C eventually got the job done, using a 
ladder and ropes to pull the cold canine from the lake while wearing ice
 suits.

Diablo's grateful owner, Jason Newsome, was waiting with a warm blanket and immediately whisked him away to a veterinarian.

Luckily Diablo suffered no permanent damage from the water.

A spokesman noted that while it is fortunate the dog was saved this week, the incident should stand as a warning to humans, too, of the serious threat that ice-covered water can pose to everyone.

I'm fine: Diablo suffered no dermanent damaged from the freezing temperature of the water, which he was stuck in for half an hour on Sunday

'It is difficult to identify the stability of ice over a body of water,' he said.

'Do not take chances venturing out on any frozen body of water. Stay safe and stay on shore!'
