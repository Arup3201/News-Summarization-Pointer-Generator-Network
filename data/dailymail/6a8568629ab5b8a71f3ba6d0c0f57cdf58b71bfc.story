Slim focus: Jenna Lyons, 44, uses organic juice cleanses, consuming nothing but liquids for more than a week, to maintain her slender figure

J. Crew's six-foot-tall creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, may be one of America's most fashionable managers, but even she isn't immune to hang-ups that plague the industry.

The 44-year-old revealed she uses organic juice and Isogenic cleanses, consuming nothing but liquids for more than a week, to maintain her slender figure.

She told Fast Company's Danielle Sacks: 'I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten in 10 days,' before adding, 'the inside button [on my pants] would pop before I even zipped it. I was like, "Oh, God!"'

The mother-of-one also told Harper's Bazaar recently that she has 'weird eating habits'.

'I don't eat breakfast,' she said. '[For lunch] I have pretty much the same thing every day. I'll go for a year eating the same thing and then I'll switch. Right now I'm eating Cobb salad; last year it was tomato soup.

'Throughout the day I alternate between coffee and this apple, ginger, and lemon juice with cayenne pepper called the Killer.'

Ms Lyons said she tries to leave J. Crew's East Village headquarters by 6pm, to eat dinner with her six-year-old son, Beckett

'[He] eats pretty early, so I'll usually eat with him as soon as I get home. His babysitter makes this incredible salmon with ginger, tomato, and cilantro. For some reason she is obsessed with me eating,' she admitted.

But she isn't impervious to treats, however.

'I have an insane collection of ice cream in my fridge,' Ms Lyons revealed. 'I love anything related to coffee ice cream. The espresso gelato from Ciao Bella is amazing. I eat a lot of ice cream, chocolate, and cookies, and I drink rosé champagne.'

The Southern Californian, who suffers from incontinentia pigmenti, may take pains to look like the models gracing J. Crew's catalogs, but her dual role as top creative executive and president is not to be snuffed at.

Todd Snyder, J. Crew CEO Mickey Drexler's former head of men's wear at Gap,
told Fast Company: 'She looks like a model, and then she talks like the
best salesperson you ever met. I think she's the most 
talented person [Mr Drexler] has ever worked with in design.

Ms Lyons' move to the top has not been easy; during her childhood she was subjected to constant bullying after her 
genetic disorder, incontinentia pigmenti, led to scarred skin, patchy hair, and lost teeth - 
requiring dentures.

She explained: 'It's amazing how cruel kids can be and superjudgmental and really just
downright mean.'

Finding refuge in art, Ms Lyons, who is dating jewelry designer Courtney Crangi, said: 'I searched for ways to make things more 
beautiful and surrounded myself with beautiful things because I didn't 
feel that in myself.

New love: Ms Crangi (left) and Ms Lyons (right) began dating last year, after the J. Crew boss split from her husband of nine years

'I felt a huge drive to make clothes that everybody could have because I
felt ostracized by that world of beauty and fashion.'

Ms Lyons, who started at J. Crew as a 21-year-old 'assistant to an assistant,' also revealed how she landed her current role, 20 years later in 2010.

When Mr Drexler arrived at J.Crew in 2003 from Gap, the company
was in financial distress.

On his first day at the company, he requested that every employee re-interview for their jobs - including Ms Lyons, who was asked to run through the women's collection in 
front of a roomful of 50 people.

Mr Drexler asked her thoughts on the three 
pairs of skinny stretch pants she was presenting.

'At that point I was like, "I have to be honest,"' recalled Ms Lyons. 'I can't
lie to him because this is sort of a do-or-die situation.'

She was honest, telling him that she didn't like much of the collection, and explained what she would like to change.

'I 
didn't know if I was going to be fired,' she said. 'I was so confused,
and I was scared, but I was also a little bit excited, because all the 
things that I liked and that I thought were brand-right he was leaving 
up on the wall. And I was like, "Is that good, is that bad? I don't 
know."'

She kept her job, even though many did not. 'Honestly, I think it was because I didn't bullshit 
him,' Ms Lyons explained. 'His bullshit-dar is insane.'

And with a fan base that includes Michelle Obama and Anna Wintour, it's not surprising she was promoted to president and creative director, where 'no financial decision weighs heavier than a creative decision,' seven years later.

A former employee explained: 'If Jenna wasn't there, J.Crew would be really good, but it would not be great. Probably a healthily run company like a Banana Republic.

'Mickey has given her enough runway so she can really make of it what she wants. They should just call it Jenna Crew.'
