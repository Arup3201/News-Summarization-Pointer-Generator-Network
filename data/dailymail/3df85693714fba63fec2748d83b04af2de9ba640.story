In his heyday, he was one of the most feared hitters in Major League Baseball.

Now, it seems, Vladimir Guerrero is trying to continue that legacy by producing a team of his very own.

For the ex-Angels right fielder has revealed he has fathered eight children by five different baby-mamas.

Hats off to you: Major League Baseball star Vladimir Guerrero has fathered eight children by five different women, costing him $25,000 in child support, legal documents have revealed

The 37-year-old has been forced to divulge his finances after a new paternity lawsuit was filed against him by one of the mothers, Heidy Ogando, it was reported on TMZ.

Legal documents show the child support is costing him an eye-watering $25,621 a month, which works out at more than $300,000 a year.

Given that he no longer has a Major League contract (he is currently playing with the Toronto Blue Jays), his offspring could leave him with a real financial headache.

But with more than $25million of stocks and bonds built up over his 16-year career, the outlay is unlikely to break the bank any time soon.

Fearsome hitter: Guerrero, seen here in action for the Baltimore Orioles last year, has built up a $25million fortune during his glittering career

Baby Mama 1 (one child): $5,237

Baby Mama 2 (one): $3,214

Baby Mama 3 (two):$1,655

Baby Mama 4 (two): $3,465

Heidy Ogando, as listed in the lawsuit, (two): $12,050

Very little has been known about Guerrero's private life until now.

One of nine children, he is the younger brother of ex-major leaguer Wilton Guerrero and the cousin of minor league player Cristian Guerrero.

Guerrero made his Major League debut for the Montreal Expos in September 1996 and went on to be honoured with the League's Most Valuable player award in 2004.

A nine-time All Star, he helped lead the Angels to five American League West championships and was voted one of the most feared hitters in baseball in a 2008 poll of all 30 Major League managers.

As of 2011, he had a career batting average of .318 and had hit 449 home runs.
