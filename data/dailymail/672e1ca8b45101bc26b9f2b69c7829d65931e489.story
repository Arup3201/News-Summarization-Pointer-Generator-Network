Texas police on Wednesday discovered the long-dead body of a man slumped in his SUV in a Walmart on Sunday.

Authorities in Deer Park say a manager from the store followed a foul odor to a silver Dodge Durango.

Inside was the body of a Native American male, Chron.com reports. Investigators would later determine he'd been dead for over a week.

Followed an odor: The body of a Native American man was found in this silver SUV on Sunday in a Walmart parking lot after an employee followed a foul odor to the vehicle

Shopping center: Police say the man had been dead at least a week in the Deer Park, Texas shopping center

Police say the man's vehicle had been in the parking lot since the time of his death.

No foul play is suspected but police said Monday they were treating the SUV as a crime scene.

The unidentified man was transported to the Harris County Medical Examiner's for further examination.

While startling, this is hardly the first body found in a parking lot of the retail mega-chain.

Just last month,  29-year-old New Hampshire mother Maura Laughlin was found dead in her car in a Walmart parking lot after recently becoming homeless, the Concord Monitor reported. 

On March 2, a homeless man was found dead in the car in which he lived in Brevard County, Florida after dying from what appeared to be natural causes, Florida Today reported. That body, too, was discovered because of its foul odor after the man had died days earlier.

The same was true at another Florida Walmart, this one in Orlando, where a man's body was discovered after decaying for several days back in 2011. 

Crime scene? Police say they've seen no indication of foul play but are treating the SUV as a crime scene, nonetheless
