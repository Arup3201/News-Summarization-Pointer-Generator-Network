The wife of an alleged child molester held his hand and kissed him, reached out to him as he stood behind bars and led protests against his prosecution as he went on trial in Indonesia today.

Tracy Bantleman's show of support for her husband Neil was transmitted across the world on the day he and an Indonesian colleague faced charges of abusing boys at Jakarta International School.

Bantleman, a Canadian who worked as an administrator at the school, and his teaching assistant colleague Ferdinand Tjiong deny the charges in a wide-ranging case that has also seen cleaning staff accused of raping a young boy.

The allegations come after the revelation that a suspected serial paedophile sought by the FBI and believed to have abused scores of boys used to teach at the school.

But Bantleman and Tjiong, who face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty, have received strong support from the school and parents, and their lawyer suggested the case could be motivated by money.

Their wives led a crowd of about 60 supporters, mostly parents, who turned up outside the court waving banners that read 'Free Neil and Ferdi' and 'Reject the invented JIS case'.

'They are the victims of slander, we are 1,000 per cent sure. If they were really paedophiles, we would be the first to know,' said Maya Lestari, who has two children at the school and was helping to coordinate the rally.

'We're innocent,' Bantleman, 46, said from a holding cell at the court in the Indonesian capital before his trial.

As he entered court, Tjiong said: 'I have come here to prove the truth, to end this slander.'

Bantleman faces court: The men are being tried separately in closed-door sessions. A judge read the charges out against them in today's session. They were not required to enter a plea

Tjiong kisses his wife after his hearing: Hotman Paris Hutapea, a lawyer for both men, said the charges against them were vague and did not even specify an exact date when the crimes allegedly took place

The men are being tried separately in closed-door sessions. A judge read the charges out against them in today's session. They were not required to enter a plea.

After the court hearings, Hotman Paris Hutapea, a lawyer for both men, said the charges against them were vague and did not even specify an exact date when the crimes allegedly took place.

'We assume this is motivated by money,' he said.

'If we uphold justice properly, how can you try a case when the prosecutors have no idea when the crime happened?'

The family of one nursery school boy allegedly abused are suing the school and seeking $125 million in damages.

The first allegation that cleaners had raped a nursery school boy emerged in April, after which more parents made abuse claims.

The first trials began in August, with four male cleaners facing charges of child sex abuse, and a sixth suspect, a woman, accused of being an accomplice.

Four of the men confessed then recanted, claiming police had beaten them into incriminating themselves. Their trials are still ongoing. 

The fifth male suspect committed suicide while in custody by drinking bathroom cleaner.

Police and private security personnel stand guard at the main entrance of Jakarta International School, which was rocked by the revelation that a suspected serial paedophile worked there for a decade 

At the South Jakarta District Court on Tuesday, Bantleman appeared in court first to hear the charges against him at the start of his trial. Tjiong appeared in court for a separate hearing after Bantleman.

They are accused of abusing three young children at the school. Both hearings were held behind closed doors.

Supports of Bantleman and Tjiong say the victim, who was six at the time the alleged abuse occurred, was subject to suggestive questioning by inexperienced police.

The abuse was alleged to have happened at a room in the school during teaching hours. Mr Bantleman, who is from Burlington, Ontario, has been held in custody in Indonesia since his arrest on July 14.

His family insist he is innocent and have called on Canadian authorities to lobby on his behalf.

Jakarta International School is attended by the children of foreign diplomats, businesspeople and Indonesia's elite. It has 2,400 students aged three to 18 from about 60 countries.

The school was shaken earlier this year when it emerged William Vahey, an American who taught at the school for ten years until 2002, killed himself as the FBI investigated allegations he sexually abused scores of teenage boys.
