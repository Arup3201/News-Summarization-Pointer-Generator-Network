A 5-year-old boy who was mauled by two Rottweiler dogs and is in serious condition at a Seattle hospital owes his life to his quick-thinking and brave mother.

A Harborview Medical Center nursing supervisor says the boy is in the intensive care unit Wednesday following surgery.

Kitsap County sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson says the boy suffered bites to his head, face and neck Tuesday at a home in Silverdale before his mother threw her body atop his to protect him.

Wilson says the boy's mother covered the child with her body until another relative could rescue the boy.

The mother was caring for the dogs as a favor to an ex-boyfriend, who is in prison.

The boy was playing outside with one dog when they attacked as a pack, Kitsap County Sheriff's spokesman Scott Wilson told KIRO.

The mother used her body like a blanket to cover her son and protect him from further bites. Another relative soon saved the boy, who was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery

'She couldn't get the dogs off the child because they were too strong, so she laid on the child and the dogs started nipping at her,' Wilson said.

The dogs have been turned over to Kitsap Animal Rescue to be tested for rabies, which is standard procedure in such cases.

Wilson said he does not expect criminal charges to be filed in the case.

'I don't think it was ever conceived that the dogs were dangerous,' Wilson said. 'There'd been no predisposition, no attacks, no anything.' 

The boy's condition was upgraded Wednesday to serious. His mother was not seriously injured. The dogs have been quarantined and will be tested for rabies (The boy's home is pictured here)
