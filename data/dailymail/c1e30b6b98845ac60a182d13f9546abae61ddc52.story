Daniel Sturridge appears to be cooking up a treat as he surprised a group of unsuspecting kids at St. Paul's Catholic Junior School.

The Liverpool striker joined Paralympian Ellie Simmonds in a surprise visit to the Liverpool school, as part of the Sainsbury’s Active Kids 2015 Launch.

The England international posed for pictures with kids, sporting a chef’s hat and apron, and was all smiles as he fulfilled his Active Kids ambassadorial duties.

Sturridge is set to be included in Brendan Rodgers squad for their clash against West Ham

The England international was integral to Rodgers’ Anfield revival last season as he scored 24 goals

Sturridge is set to be included in Brendan Rodgers squad for their clash against West Ham at Anfield on Saturday, after a lay off period which has seen the striker recover from a serious thigh problem.

The 25-year-old last played for Liverpool 152 days ago, and his return will be a welcome addition to the squad, who have struggled for goals.

The England international was integral to Rodgers’ Anfield revival last season, scoring 24 goals in 33 appearances, propelling Liverpool to a second place finish.

Sturridge was runner-up in the Premier League golden boot, finishing second to team mate Luis Suarez. The infamous SAS (Sturridge and Suarez) partnership recorded a prolific 50 goals last season.
