Toymaking giant Playmobil has been accused by concerned parents and children's charities of 'glorifying crime' for selling children's playsets depicting a bank robbery and a 'fatal' bike crash.

But German company Playmobil has dismissed the claims and said their graphic children's toys are acceptable because children need to be taught about 'baddies'

Toys R Us, Argos and Amazon have all stocked the controversial Playmobil sets, which are part of Playmobil's 'City Action' series, in the run up to Christmas.

Toymaking giant Playmobil has been accused by parents and children's charities of 'glorifying crime' for selling children's games as part of its 'City Action' series- including this one which depicts a bank robbery

One of the plastic sets, called the Bank and Raid, shows a female bank robber holding a gun while sticking up a terrified bank worker who is handing over wads of cash.

The set, on sale for £39.99, has created a storm of controversy among justice campaigners and parent groups, for 'glorifying' crime.

The toy is aimed at children aged four to ten and features a blonde woman disguised behind a pair of large black sunglasses sticking up a cashier, and comes complete with gold bullion and bank notes.

The other set, thought to be new for this Christmas, depicts an injured cyclist getting stretchered into the back of an ambulance after suffering a crash - and comes with extra bandages.

Playmobil has caused controversy before, manufacturing construction worker play sets which come complete with shovels, tools and three crates of what appears to be beer. 

Concerned dad Trevor Johnson, 43, spotted both the sets for sale at the Tunbridge Wells branch of Toys R Us, in Kent.

He said: 'It's depressing because it says to kids 'this is what life is like'.

'A gun for a four-year-old is quite shocking. I think there is a difference between boys playing with soldiers and someone actually staging a bank robbery - and it's not like it's a tacky brand.

'There is something a bit nasty about depicting a crime and it could then make it scary for kids going in to banks.

'It's also a bit grim people being run over.

'You do have a woman bank robber so it is half politically correct.'

A Kent mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'My daughter is five, and she's just learning to ride her bike.

'The last thing I want her playing with is a toy that shows a dead cyclist which has been run over.

'It's horrific. Toys should be about fun, not grim reality.'

 Concerned parents described the toys as 'horrific' and say the toys send out the wrong message to children

Toy retailer the Early Learning Centre carry the Playmobil City Action line in their stores, but do not stock the two controversial sets on their website.

Smyths do not have the sets listed on their website either. 

Danny Bryan of Communities Against Gun and Knife Crime, which works to help youngsters avoid lives of violence, said: 'We don't want to be encouraging young people to look at these sorts of things.

'I think it is horrendous that young people are given all these images to shape them. It is sending out the wrong message.' 

Jamie Dickinson, Playmobil marketing manager, said: 'We have been producing police and emergency services play sets for over 35 years.

'One thing our customer feedback tells us is that it is important that children can be taught, through play, the importance of recognising good from evil and 'baddies' from 'goodies', as well as understanding scenes from real life, such as accidents and emergencies.

'We fully support creating a safe environment for all children and would hope that in their own small way our sets deliver this in a secure, but believable, way.'

Toys R Us have refused to comment.
