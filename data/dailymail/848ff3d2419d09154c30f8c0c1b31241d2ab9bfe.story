The parents of a teenage couple who ran away ten days ago are desperately searching for the 13 and 14-year-old and today have begged them to come home or at least make contact.

The Isabella County Sheriff’s Department
says Jayden Thomas, 13, and Braxton Wood, 14, were last seen on Monday, August 26, in Clare, Michigan. Braxton took his mother's Ford Explorer.

Since then, neither family have heard anything from them. Both sets of parents said the young couple's relationship had grown too serious too soon.

They were said to have been very upset at the news they would be going to different Michigan high schools, which they would have started this week.

Jayden's mother also revealed that she told her daughter she no longer supported the six-month relationship. She ran away some time later.

Vehicle: The teens are believed to be driving a 2005 black ford explorer which belongs to Braxton's mom

Brandon's father, pictured with his mother Sarah Kiley, said: 'It's like a nightmare. You don't know what to do, where to go or who to call'

Kelly Drinkwine said: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them.

'She wrote a message for me in lipstick on the mirror saying, "I love you so much, stay happy and beautiful".

'They are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible people out there. Just come home, baby. Just come home.'

She said their six-month relationship was too serious and Jayden said she could not live without Braxton.

'That's when I felt I had to bring my daughter back to reality. The day she left I told her I no longer supported their relationship.'

Brandon's father Ed Wood told  WZZM13: 'It's like a nightmare. You don't know what to do, where to go or who to call.'

Braxton's mother, Sarah Kiley. 'They can't live on their own. They are 13 and 14 years old. They didn't want to do anything but be with each other. It was pretty intense for a 14-year-old.

Sarah told ABC: 'We looked around the house and realized Braxton was missing and we still didn't comprehend it because Braxton hasn't had driver's training. He is a young 14, so no drivers' experience whatsoever.'

She said she became concerned when the two of them started alienating friends so they could spend all their time together.

'They didn't want to hang out with friends. Their focus was each other and that's pretty intense for 14-year-olds,' Kiley said, adding that her son did not take the news they were going to different high schools very well.

'Braxton told us he was heartbroken. We thought that they had cooled and not seeing each other anymore,' she said.

Jayden's mother Kelly Drinkwine said: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them. They are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible people out there'

Broke: Their parents believe they only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash

Appeal: The missing posters circulated around the area for the teens who have been gone for ten days

Jayden is described as five feet, three inches tall and weighs about 120lbs. She has blonde hair and hazel/blue eyes.

Braxton is five feet, inches inches tall, weighs 125lbs and has blonde hair and blue eyes.

Their parents believe they only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash.

West Michigan private eye Mike Cook is part of the team trying to find the teenagers.

'Trying to find these two has been a little bit more difficult than any of us would have thought,' he said. 'They are 13 and 14-years-old, boyfriend and girlfriend. It's our impression they have not made contact with anyone.

'We know they have been in western Michigan. We know they have been throughout central Michigan.

'The last area we know for sure is the Mt Pleasant area, but it's been a few days since we've had a good solid lead of where we knew they were.'

He added that the teens have likely run out of money and will likely start 'doing things you don't want to see kids do to make money'.
