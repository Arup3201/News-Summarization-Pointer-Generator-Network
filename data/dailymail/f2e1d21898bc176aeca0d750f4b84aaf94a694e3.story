Social media company Foursquare has compiled data on a year's worth of 'check-ins' showing the movement of life around some of the world's major cities.

The company monitored check‑ins in Istanbul, London, Chicago, Tokyo, New York and San Francisco and plotted them onto on a map.

The results were a series of staggering time lapse videos that shows activity in the cities every hour of the day.

Each dot represents a single check‑in, while the straight lines link sequential check‑ins.

The videos features a color-coded key, indicating which dots on the map refer to certain types of activities.

6am
 in London, it's revealed is relatively empty. Dots on the screen
 indicate that most of the check-ins are work- and travel-related.

Just two hours later, the capital is 
swarmed with yellow dots, indicating the morning rush of commuters at 
work.

London at 6am is relatively quiet, but Foursquare check-ins already show some users going to work

In this image, based off a compilation of user-submitted data, London looks nearly overrun with commuters

By 1pm the video indicates green check-ins, showing users may be getting lunch

At 8pm the travel and transport colours are high as people finish their daily commute

There are also highly visible mint-coloured lines, indicating 
check-ins on bridges and highways.

By 12pm, London is dominated by yellow and green dots, showing that most Foursquare users are either at work or having a bite to eat.

Check-ins indicating a possible commute home are visible by 5pm in the video, with bright mint dots covering the screen.

WATCH: Timelapse video of Chicago at work

At 6am the city in Chicago central is relatively quiet and it looks as it a lot of food is being consumed in the suburbs

By 10am Chicago is covered in yellow indicating people checking in at 'professional and other places'

By 12pm there is an influx of people checking in at food places for lunch

At 8pm the video shows similar scenes inTokyo and San Francisco

At 9pm, most check-ins are green and 
blue, suggesting that Foursquare users are eating and engaging in city 
nightlife, respectively. By midnight, nearly all check-ins refer to city
 nightlife.

By 3am, however, there are a handful of green check-ins, indicating that Foursquare users may be seeking a late-night snack.

MailOnline reported on the movement in New York in October. It showed a fairly similar pattern to London, although at 3am it showed significantly more movement suggesting it really is the city that never sleeps.

The videos shows similar scenes in Istanbul, Chicago, Tokyo and San Francisco.

San Francisco showed much less movement at 3am than London and New York, although Tokyo showed even less at that time.
