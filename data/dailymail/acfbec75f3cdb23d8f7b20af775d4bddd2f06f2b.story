Championship and Premier League clubs are talking to Brazilian striker Tulio after he rejected the chance to join Charlton Athletic.

The 29-year-old free agent had a successful trial at Charlton but opted against the move after they changed the terms of their initial offer.

Charlton are understood to have originally discussed a two-year deal but instead made Tulio a six-month offer with an option of another year on £11,000 a week.

Tulio is attracting interest from Premier League sides after turning down signing for Charlton Athletic

Tulio, formerly of Evian, Lille and Palermo is now training with Corinthians in Brazil but is eager to move to England.

The striker, who is represented by Elite Career Management who also have links with former Aston Villa midfielder Jean Makoun and Raymond van der Wiel at Paris St Germain, is 6ft 4ins tall, good in the air but also technically good.

MLS side Houston Dynamo also have an interest.
