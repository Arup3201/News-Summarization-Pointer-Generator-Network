A young mother-of-two has refused NHS cancer treatment and is trying to cure herself with herbal remedies and a raw food diet instead.

Kelly Logan, from Dagenham, Essex, was diagnosed with breast cancer just five months ago after finding a lump in her chest.

The 34-year-old was devastated when doctors told her she needed emergency surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to give her the best chance of survival.

But to the horror of her doctors - and initially her family - she has defiantly refused all medical treatment, opting to eat raw vegetables and take vitamin supplements  in a bid to prolong her life.

Kelly Logan, 34, was diagnosed with breast cancer but has refused medical treatment, as she says chemotherapy would leave her unable to care for children Logan, 14, and Blaze, 4

Ms Logan was told she needed surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But she refused these treatments, opting to eat a diet of raw vegetables - with no fish or meat - and take vitamins and herbal remedies instead

Ms Logan said she has always been against invasive medical treatments, and believes doctors are 'biased' towards them. She is pictured, left, before she became ill and, right, after her diagnosis

Ms Logan said: 'I don't want to lose my breast and be pumped full of chemotherapy.

'People have called me selfish because I'm refusing all treatment provided on the NHS but if anything, having the treatment is selfish.

'I wouldn't be able to do anything with my eldest son, Logan, who is 14, and my youngest son, Blaze, who is just four, if I was being sick and feeling tired all the time.

'Thanks to my new eating and exercising regime, I now feel healthier than ever.

'Being diagnosed with breast cancer at such a young age is heartbreaking but I was more petrified of chemotherapy than I was about the cancer.

'I felt doctors were biased towards conventional treatment.'

Ms Logan has always been against chemotherapy and invasive treatments that aim to cure cancer.

Ms Logan takes around 20 vitamins a day as well as herbal remedies, which she claims shore up her immune system. She also exercises as often as she can

Professor Peter Johnson, medical oncologist and chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, warned if left untreated, Ms Logan’s cancer is likely to spread around her body.

He told MailOnline: ‘I completely understand that someone who has just been told they have cancer might be scared and worried - and might seek alternative treatments.

‘But this is a very risky strategy.

‘Cancer Research UK spends millions carrying out clinical trials to ensure the advice doctors give to patients about cancer is evidence-based.

‘There simply isn’t any reliable evidence for alternative approaches.

‘Sometimes we see spontaneous remissions, which are put down to alternative therapies, but no clinical trial has ever showed them to be effective.'

He added: ‘If I was getting on an aeroplane to travel across the Atlantic, I would want to get on the plane with someone who was trained, knew what they were doing, and had looked at the evidence. 

'Not with someone without a licence who vaguely thought there was a chance they could fly a plane. 

'There is simply no evidence diet changes and vitamins can treat cancer.

‘One of the reasons breast cancer deaths have come down in recent years is because we have effective treatments in the form of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

‘If people don’t take those treatments they have to realise they are putting their lives at risk.

‘Breast cancer spreads into the breasts, into the chest wall, into the lymph nodes and into the blood stream and around the body.

‘It’s likely if this lady isn’t treated her cancer will spread around her body. That’s what usually happens.

‘She has a high chance of cure with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It would be a real shame for her to miss out on this.’ 

She said: 'One of my friends had cancer but he died while having chemo as his immune system became so low.

'Also, the thought of losing my hair terrified me as well, I didn't want to look like a cancer sufferer.

'Doctors told me I needed to lose my whole right breast and that chemo would stop it from spreading.

'I decided to research alternative treatments online and that's when I found out about the different herbal remedies you can take to help your body.

'I no longer eat meat or fish and live off a 90 per cent raw vegetable diet so I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit juices.' 

However, experts warn there is no evidence alternative therapies can cure cancer, stop its spread or slow tumour growth.  

Sue Green, senior information development nurse at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Using herbal remedies instead of traditional cancer treatment is considered a form of alternative therapy.

'Alternative therapies are used instead of conventional cancer treatments. They are different from complementary therapies.

'No alternative therapies have ever been proven to cure cancer or slow its growth and Macmillan Cancer Support does not advocate the use of them.

'For anyone considering, or currently having, alternative therapy it is important to tell your doctor as soon as possible.'

But Ms Logan believes chemotherapy would ruin her quality of life, and alternative therapies will allow her to live longer.

She said: 'I don't allow cancer to rule my day to day life but I like to see if my self-healing is working to halt the growth of my lump.

'I work 50-hours a week, I support two young children and I exercise as often as I can.'

She monitors the size of the lump on her breast by drawing two black dots onto it every day.

Her family were devastated when she told them she was going to refuse all treatment, but

She said: 'My mum was really upset but once I showed her my research and what I hoped to do, she understood and accepted my decision.

'My breast cancer is ductal carcinoma and doctors think it's linked to an infection I caught during breastfeeding in my milk duct which caused the mutation of cells to grow.'

Ms Logan has an ultrasound on her breast every three months but doesn't plan to accept treatment even if her cancer starts to grow rapidly.

Ms Logan, pictured with her youngest son Blaze, four, before she was diagnosed, says she will carry on treating herself with alternative therapies even if scans show her cancer tumour has grown

She said: 'On my last check-up in January they told me that my lump at grown 0.9mm, which is such a tiny amount considering how long I have had the tumour for.

'I have asked for an MRI but my doctor knows that even if my cancer had spread that I wouldn't want chemotherapy so there's no point in finding out.'

She says feels that she's taking her life into her own hands and wants others to do the same.

She added: 'I feel better than I ever have, people always say I look great considering I have cancer but it's because I haven't been pumped with drugs.

'I take about 20 different vitamins to help keep up my immune system.

'I'm not looking for a miracle cure but I feel I can keep my life as normal by following my own detoxing treatment plan.

'I haven't asked doctors how long I will live without treatment but I'm confident it will be longer than if I had conventional treatment.

Ms Logan has even set up a blog to document her journey and is writing an eBook in a bid to provide others with diet tips and herbal remedies that combat cancer.

She said: 'I know not everyone will agree with my choice of self-healing but there are lots of people who do and it's amazing how much support I have had from complete strangers.

'I hope my story gives others the strength to make their own cancer treatment decisions based on what they want rather than what doctors feel is best.'

Ductal breast cancer - also called ductal carcinoma - is the most common type of breast cancer. 

Around 90 out of every 100 breast cancers diagnosed (90 per cent) are this type. 

A ductal carcinoma  is a cancer that started in the cells that line the ducts of the breasts - the 'pipes' that carry milk from the milk-producing lobules to the nipple

It has begun to spread into the surrounding breast tissue.

Treatment for ductal breast cancer includes:
