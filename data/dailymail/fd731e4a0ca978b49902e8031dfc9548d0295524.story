A-list actor Jim Carrey has put his ethics ahead of his career by refusing to promote the second Kick-Ass film, saying he cannot support that level of violence.

The star of The Mask and The Truman Show made the decision to pull out of the film's media promotions in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting last December.

The 51-year-old stars as Colonel Stars and Stripes in the R-rated film, a vicious ex-mafia member turned crime fighter who leads a team of other heroes.

The violent nature of the film seems 
to have left a mark on the Canadian, who is a staunch gun control 
advocate, and according to his personal tweets he will now no longer be promoting the film on principle.

Menacing: He plays a violent ex-mafia member in Kick-Ass 2 but on anti-violence principles has pulled out from promoting the film

The grandfather-of-one wrote on Twitter:
'I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I 
cannot support that level of violence.'

He added a few minutes later: 'I 
meant to say my apologies to others involved with the film. I am not 
ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart.'

The movie will be released in the UK and the US on 16 August.

Big pay day: Jim Carrey has announced he will not promote Kick-Ass 2 due to the film's violent content

Twit: The movie star made his proclamations on the social media website on Sunday

Mark Millar, creator of the original comic book and the film's executive producer said he was 'baffled' by Carrey's decision and asked him to reconsider.

'I cannot support that level of violence': Carrey said  Sandy Hook shootings made him think twice about content of Kick-Ass 2

In a forum on his website Millarworld, he wrote: 'As you may know, Jim is a passionate advocate of gun-control and I respect both his politics and his opinion, but I'm baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture wasn't in the screenplay eighteen months ago.

'Yes, the body-count is very high, but a movie called Kick-Ass 2 really has to do what it says on the tin.

'A sequel to the picture that gave us Hit-Girl was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much... like Jim, I'm horrified by real-life violence (even though I'm Scottish), but Kick-Ass 2 isn't a documentary.'

He added: 'Ultimately, this is his decision, but I've never quite bought the notion that violence in fiction leads to violence in real-life any more than Harry Potter casting a spell creates more Boy Wizards in real life.,, Jim, I love ya and I hope you reconsider for all the above points.'

Universal Pictures, the film's studio, has yet to comment on Carrey's decision.  

Principal
photography began on September 7 2012 in Canada, before moving to 
London, with the shooting eventually finishing on November 23, 2012.

Just a couple of weeks later, the Sandy Hook tragedy, in which 28 people in total were 
killed by gunman Adam Lanza, happened.

Fans
of the actor seemed split on his proclamation, with one saying, 'can 
you explain more? You're basically saying you don't indorse (sic) kick ass 
even though you're a big part of it? Seems strange to me.'

Another
added, 'It's a movie. A fun, violent movie. If there was no violence on
TV there might be more in real life,' with some even calling on him to 
give away his salary to prove his sincerity.

However
others supported his stance, with one saying: 'Very brave to come out 
with that, I hope you get that support form the film industry, most are 
good understanding people.'

As
well as being a stanch gun control activist, Jim is also a 
anti-vaccination campaigner, and has previously claimed $10m paycheque 
he received for his role in Dumb and Dumber proves the validity of The 
Law of Attraction.

The 
script for the first Kick- Ass film was written by Jane Goldman, the 
wife of British chat show host Jonathan Ross, however, she did not 
return for the second instalment.

Kick-Ass 2, which features a new group of villains hellbent on tackling the titular character, is released in the UK on August 14 and the US two days later. 

The violent nature of the film seems to have left a mark on the Canadian, pictured left last year at the NY Comedy Awards, and right in 2008 at the Yes Man premier,  who will now no longer be promoting the film
