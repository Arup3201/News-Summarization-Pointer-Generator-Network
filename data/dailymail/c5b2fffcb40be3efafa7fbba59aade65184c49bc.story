From the air, it looks little different from any other exclusive development  in one of Britain’s most  affluent areas.

Set in tranquil surroundings, the upmarket crescent of multi-million pound houses in Surrey overlooks an historic swathe of private parkland.

Little wonder that couples with the means to pay up to £3.5million for a newly built mansion were keen to put their deposits down when they came up for sale.

Exclusive: The six houses bought by the mystery buyers cost up to £3.5million each

But shortly before contracts could be exchanged, mystery Arab buyers were allowed to gazump the would-be owners by buying four of the houses for cash. Then they bought another two neighbouring ones – and began to corral them all with fencing and barbed wire.

Now neighbours in Kingswood Warren, in the grounds of a mansion formerly used as a technical research base for the BBC,  fear they will be living next to a high security ‘stockade’ created by the Gulf royal family said to be behind the purchase.

Or, as one described it, a ‘Little Persia’ in the heart of leafy Surrey. Yesterday residents were embroiled in a fractious stalemate with the newcomers, whom they accused of ‘riding roughshod’ over planning laws and community spirit.

Difference: The fence is considerably larger than what was allowed before

Thorny issue: Parts of the fence have been topped with barbed wire

Contacted by the Mail, an intermediary for the buyers described the complainants as ‘uncivilised people’. UK-based Jacky Saunders admitted planning permission for the fencing had been sought only retrospectively, but added: ‘When I get it they will regret that they have confused matters.’

Seven luxury houses forming a crescent called Kingswood Warren Park were sold by development firm Octagon.

All were five-bedroom ‘mini palaces’ bedecked with marble and high-quality fittings.

Octagon was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement when the new cash buyers stepped in.

Although the homes were officially sold to a Cayman Islands-registered firm, Symphony Ltd, it is believed Symphony was acting on behalf of four members of a Middle East royal family.

So why might fabulously rich Arabs, whose normal playgrounds are multi-million pound homes in London, wish to set up camp in an already well-established community in Surrey?

The answer might be that it’s the perfect place from which to visit the Derby once a year at nearby Epsom.

Included in the sale at the 11th hour was a road the new owners want to seal off, effectively turning the site into a Middle East-style compound. 

None of this was in the minds of three couples who paid £10,000 each to reserve three of the four homes in question. Just before contracts were to be exchanged, they were told all four had been sold.

Octagon chief executive Colin Tutt refused to discuss the purchase.

But one ‘gazumpee’ said: ‘It all stank a little bit – that somebody pitches up with a bag of cash from the Middle East and it becomes a confidential thing, and everybody sucks up to them. It’s not cricket.’ 

Janine Connick, secretary of adjoining Hamilton Place residents’ association, said: ‘We fear this is actually the start of something rather worrying.’
