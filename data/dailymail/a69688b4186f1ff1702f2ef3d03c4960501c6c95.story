These incredible photos of a huge saltwater crocodile devouring a foal in the Northern Territory give a fascinating insight into the natural world.

Australian landscape photographer Paul Arnold, who captured the moment, and told MailOnline 'It was fascinating without being brutal... Real nature doing what it does.'

While on one of his photographic tours on a billabong in Kakadu National Park Mr Arnold said something caught his eye on the bank.

Photographer Paul Arnold captured these incredible photographs of a huge saltwater crocodile chowing down on a foal

The saltwater dragged the baby horse into the billabong with him as amazed tourists watched on

'We were out there on a cruise and we saw this horse acting a bit strange... about two metres back from the bank. I thought "That crocs trying to get the horse" but it didnt look right.'

He then spotted the crocodile below, which had scared off the large horse. Left behind on the banks was a stillborn foal.

Mr Arnold said: 'We watched this croc grab this foal and back into the water', and kept the boat nearby for about 20 minutes watching the scene before him unfold.'

The 4.5 metre long croc then dragged the foal onto the banks where Mr Arnold believes he stowed it away to devour

The foal was stillborn and after the crocodile had scared off its mother seized the moment and claimed the baby

'Two customers from the Netherlands were on board they were amazed and they just couldnt believe what was happening.'

From there, the 4.5 metre saltwater croc dragged the foal back up the bank, and Mr Arnold said he thinks the animal stored the baby horse nearby before it could devour the whole thing.

'It wasn't graphic... Just nature, brute force of nature and this big croc just doing what it does. It was enjoying to watch 'cause it's natural,' Mr Arnold revealed.

The photographer who captured the amazing images said he spotted the crocodile the next day looking very full

Mr Arnold said the whole thing was very natural to observe and in no way graphic or upsetting

When back in the same area the next day, the photographer saw the same crocodile 'wallowing' in the shallows who looked as though he'd eaten far too much.

'The next day we came across this croc and he was huge! He had eaten that whole horse.'

Mr Arnold is convinced it was the same creature, as there are only four or five ones of the same size which roam the area.

The animal is one of the boss crocodiles and is a massive 4.5 metres long, one of only four or five of the same size in the area
