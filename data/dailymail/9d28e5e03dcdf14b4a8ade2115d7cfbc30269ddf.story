Piled high with rubbish, this is the house of squalor where the mummified body of a four-year-old boy was found in his cot.

It is barely believable that a family in 21st century Britain could live in such horrific conditions.

Almost every room was littered with plastic bags of household rubbish, bottles, filthy nappies, newspapers, vomit and mouldy food.

In the living room it was waist-high; the kitchen was in a similar state, and even the bath had cat faeces in it.

This is the home in which little Hamzah spent his short life before mother Hutton let him starve to death

Shocking: Hamzah's decomposed body was found in his mother's home two years after he died in 2009

Somehow jobless Amanda Hutton, 43, lived in this terrace  house in Heaton, Bradford, with her eight children.

The only room which was not in this truly horrific condition was Hutton’s bedroom. But for almost two years that room contained a terrible secret.

Hidden in a travel cot, beneath clothes, shoes and bedding, was the body of Hamzah Khan. The little boy had been starved to death by his cruel alcoholic and cannabis-addicted mother.

He wasted away to such an extent that when he died he was wearing baby clothes of a six to nine-month-old baby. Fed on just a banana and some milk a day, he scavenged around for scraps.

So horrid were the facts of this case that the original jury at Bradford Crown Court were discharged because one juror was overwhelmed with emotion after a few minutes.

Bathroom: Authorities do not know how long the toilet has been covered in excrement, tissues and rubbish

Kitchen: Rubbish was piled high all over Hutton's home. Bottles of spirits cover every inch of the kitchen top

Hallway: Dr Pepper bottles, food packets, alcohol, clothes, moth-eaten toys and stains cover the floor and walls

Judge Roger Thomas, QC, told the trial that when police walked into the house and found the body in September 2011 they opened a ‘terrible Pandora’s box’.

The smell was gut-wrenching and dead flies were seen all over the windowsill.

When Hutton answered the door, there were flies buzzing around her head.

A hardened police officer who searched the house had to walk outside in revulsion.

There were five children aged between five and 13 living there and the youngest ones were crawling through the waste in dirty nappies.

Hutton told police how she had gone to the supermarket in December 2009, and received a call from her oldest son Tariq, 24, that Hamzah’s eyes were ‘rolling to the back of his head’.

She returned home to find Hamzah dead. Hutton said she held her son for hours before placing him back in his travel cot.

Astonishingly she didn’t call the emergency services and carried on with her life as if nothing had happened – even continuing to claim Hamzah’s child benefit. Tariq, too, kept the secret.

Burial: Hutton and her 24-year-old son Tariq Khan have been convicted of failing to bury the neglected little boy

Abusive: Social services and police saw Hutton as an abuse victim. They failed to notice her own actions

Hutton spent her days drinking bottles of vodka, rarely venturing out.

Her young children had to fend for themselves while she drank ‘more vodka than water’.

They were told that if anyone asked, they were to say Hamzah had moved to live with relatives in Portsmouth.

As the months passed no one reported Hamzah missing or feared for his safety.

It was as if this waif-like boy had never existed.

People in the neighbourhood were oblivious to what was happening inside the house. Some had never seen Hamzah and didn’t realise some of the children existed.

Living room: The floors were covered in rubbish and mouldy food that the children were forced to crawl through

But Hutton was also so cut off from relatives that her father didn’t know Hamzah had been born.

Alan Hutton, a phone installation engineer living in the Scottish Borders, said he was ashamed of his wayward daughter and they lost touch a decade ago.

'What she has done is evil,’ he said.

'What kind of mother starves her own child to death? Can she even be a part of the human race? He died all on his own, a painful death.

'Social services should have taken him away. They should have intervened. There was an apathy there.

'It is better to do too much than too little. They let him down.

'She had been living like that for years, this was not something that happened overnight. That poor little boy could have been saved, but nobody did anything to help him.'

Abusive relationship: Hutton was 16 when she met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford

Mr Hutton’s marriage broke down when his daughter was a rebellious teenager who regular smoked cannabis and she was soon living independently.

At 16, Hutton met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford. She became pregnant in her teens with Tariq.

Khan worked as a mechanic and taxi driver. Hutton briefly worked as a care assistant, but primarily she looked after her children.

The court heard she was beaten by Khan throughout the 20-year relationship.

Her personal problems worsened dramatically a few months after Hamzah was born when Hutton’s mother Ann died from breast cancer in December 2005, leaving her heartbroken.

She was on anti-depressants for post-natal depression and turned increasingly to alcohol.

Police were regularly called to the house, but Hutton refused to make a complaint against her violent partner. She changed her mind and they finally split up in December 2008 after Khan attacked Tariq.

Khan was later convicted of beating Hutton.

During police interviews, he told officers: 'She’s a bitter and twisted woman and there’s something seriously wrong with her. She don’t brush her teeth, she don’t clean herself, she don’t look after herself. She’s an alcoholic.'
