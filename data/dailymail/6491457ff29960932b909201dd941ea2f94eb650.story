An auction house is hoping to appeal to wannabe politicians by selling 10 Downing Street - for just £40,000.

But any prospective buyer won't be making Prime Minister David Cameron homeless, they'll be buying this end-of-terrace property in Nottingham.

The three-storey home has two double bedrooms, lounge, kitchen/breakfast room, gas central heating, double glazing and a white door.

It is going under the hammer on September 4 at Graham Penny Auctions' Nottingham Racecourse sale.

Power property: An auction house is selling 10 Downing Street for just £40,000. However, the property is not the Prime Minister's home (right) but an end-of-terrace in Nottingham (left)

The home, which requires 'general cosmetic improvement and upgrading', is being offered subject to tenancy with a guide price of just £40,000.

Built in the early 20th Century, it has around 670sq/ft of space and a small courtyard garden at the rear.

It is currently being let out for approximately £395 per month.

At 3,800 sq/ft, the Prime Minister's property is more than five times the size of the home in Nottingham and is tucked away on a private road in a historic part of London.

No nuclear bunker then? The three-storey home has two double bedrooms, lounge, kitchen/breakfast room, gas central heating and double glazing

While London's Downing Street is worth an estimated £50million, the PM probably can't have a friendly natter over his garden fence with his neighbour George Osborne, like he would in Nottingham

Pastor Real Estate, in London, believe that if the PM's home ever came onto the market it would sell for more than £50million or achieve a rental of £45,000 a week.

But the Nottingham Property has the advantage of being an end-of-terrace, rather than the PM's mid-terrace home.

Vejay Pal, senior valuer at Graham Penny Auctions Nottingham, said: 'It is not every day you see 10 Downing Street for sale.

'This clearly isn't the head of government's home, however we've already received a reasonable amount of interest in the property a month before the auction - no doubt in part because of its better-known double.

'The lot itself is an ideal investment property benefiting from gas central heating and double glazing.

'It does require some cosmetic improvement and upgrading but with a little effort it could produce a healthy return or yield for a property investor or landlord.'
