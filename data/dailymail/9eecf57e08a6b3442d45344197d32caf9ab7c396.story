The man who fired Borussia Dortmund to the Champions League final just two seasons ago says he expects his former side to be back in Europe's elite next season.

Robert Lewandowski scored against his old club as Bayern Munich came from behind to beat Jurgen Klopp's struggling side.

But the Polish striker insists Dortmund, who are currently in the relegation zone after losing five of their previous six Bundesliga games, will catch up with their rivals.

Dortmund are struggling in the Bundesliga this season, but Lewandowski has backed them to turn it around

'I know BVB are still a great team,' said Lewandowski after the game. 'They're struggling at the moment.

'But I expect them to come catch up again and I know they will play in the Champions League again next season.'

Lewandowski's goal, which cancelled out Marco Reus' first-half header, was his first against Dortmund since joining German champions Bayern this summer.

Despite the tough start, Lewandowski thinks his former club will make next season's Champions League

And while the striker pointed to the sky after finding the net he insisted it was not a celebration against his former employers. 

'It was not an easy game - for me, either,' he said. 'I did not celebrate  but it was an important goal and it was a goal for my dad.

'We were not perfect during the first half but the only important thing is that we got the three points.'
