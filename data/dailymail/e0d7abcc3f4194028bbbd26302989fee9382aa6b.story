Human remains are still lying around the MH17 crash site nine days after the tragedy and are exposed to the 'ravages of the European summer and animals,' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.

Addressing media on Saturday, Mr Abbott - referring to information he had received from Australian teams who have arrived in Ukraine - said the presence of 'unrecovered remains' at the site highlights the urgent need for an international force to secure the area.

Local villagers are some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage, which stretches across kilometres of farming villages.

Australia has sent 230-strong team, comprising 190 federal police and defence personnel - including medical specialists, to Europe but they have had to remain in Kiev until permission is given for them to enter eastern Ukraine to assist with the recovery operation.

The nation's officials had gained access to the site on Friday, but Mr Abbott added: 'Plainly, there are unrecovered bodies remaining in the area.'

'It's the presence of unrecovered remains that makes it more important than ever that an international team be dispatched to the site to recover remains, to assist investigations and to obtain justice...for the victims and their loved ones.

'Every day the site remains unsecured, there is more interference and the remains are subject to the ravages of the European summer, animals, disturbance, etc.'

Plundered: A child’s belongings spill out of an opened suitcase. It is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on July 17

Permission from Ukraine's parliament for armed Australian personnel to enter the site should be secured next week.

Mr Abbott said it was not unusual for armed representatives to be involved.

'When you've got a major humanitarian effort as we have, it's normal and natural to have [Australian Defence Force] assistance,' he said.

The presence of armed personnel should not compound the MH17 tragedy but the recovery and investigation effort needed to move swiftly and those involved should not be in danger, Mr Abbott said.

'We do want to get this done as quickly as we humanly can and that's why we're exploring all options.'

Special envoy air chief marshal Angus Houston said the armed personnel would be protecting the experts at the crash site, and were working with the Ukrainian parliament to ratify the arrangement.

'We welcome Acting Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman’s comments on 25 July that he hopes the Verhovna Rada [Parliament of Ukraine] can adopt the arrangement next week,' he said.

'The president, government and parliament of Ukraine are working together to get the arrangement ratified.

'Australia understands that this is a politically challenging time for Ukraine, and we greatly appreciate the assistance and cooperation received from President Poroshenko, Acting Prime Minister Groysman, Foreign Minister Klimkin, and other Ukrainian officials.'

An Australian squadron leader who is one of the pilots flying remains of victims to the Netherlands on a C-17 aircraft told the ABC that it was a 'big' and 'very sad task'.

Royal Australian Air Force squadron leader Dean Bolton told the national broadcaster that flying from Eindhoven Air base to the Ukraine took three hours.

Then cargo and human remains were loaded up and the aircraft returned to Eindhoven, where a 'ramp ceremony' - respectfully removing the remains from the aircraft in coffins - was conducted.

'It's a big task. It's a very sad task. But all the folks deployed over here take great pride in taking part in it and just being able to help out with getting the people back to their families.'

Squadron leader Bolton said the most challenging moment had probably been meeting the families after a ceremony at Eindhoven.

'That's been certainly quite a touching moment,' he said.

'They are thankful for what we are doing here.

'They're obviously going through untold grief but their only real response has been thankful that we're here.'

Tragic: A toy teddy bear placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine, shows a mark of respect to the victims

Wreckage: The Malaysia Airlines flight was carrying 298 passengers when it came down over eastern Ukraine on July 17

Tragic: One resident surveys the damage of MH17 which was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it came down over eastern Ukraine, killing all on board

It has been nine days since the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over a remote war-torn corner of eastern Ukraine.

But as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder, the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight MH17 was all too evident yesterday.

Three generations of one Ukrainian family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm.

Many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 1.5m high crops are harvested next month.

But it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30C heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed pro-Russian rebels accused of destroying the Boeing 777 with a missile.

It can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur must make of it all.

Although the repatriation flights have begun, just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the Netherlands for identification.

Almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten Britons – could still be missing and may never be found. The band of inexperienced Kalashnikov-wielding recruits in charge in this corner of Ukraine has refused access to international forensic experts. 

As a result, the crash scene – which stretches for kilometres across the farming villages of Rassypnoe, Grabovo and Petropavloka – remains in a state of ugly chaos.

Persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost. Parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap.

Giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles, along with twisted burnt metal, suitcases and clothing. Parts of the doomed jet’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from.

Wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children’s shoes and toys. A baby’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters. Nearby, a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground.

Also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet’s hold, including pigeons, two dogs, peacocks and parrots.

Respect: Funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of MH17 arrived at the Korporaal van Oudheusden Kazerne barracks in Hilversum, The Netherlands on Thursday

Tributes: Hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n Eindhoven, Netherlands, as several of the bodies of the MH17 victims were transported back to the country

Some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died.

Retired miner Alexander Benayka, 57, who lives yards from the crashed cockpit, said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar.

The father of two, one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies, said: ‘You can smell them everywhere. It is too hot. There are also wild dogs here. The bodies will not last much longer. We need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late.

‘The bodies are in the fields but you cannot see them for the sunflowers. We do not harvest until the end of August so unless someone comes to help, they will not be uncovered until then.’

Tears streaming down his face, Mr Benayka added: ‘I saw many dead children here by my house. I bring flowers and light candles as respect for them.’

Grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash.

The Foreign Office yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud.

The crash investigation is being led by a Dutch team as 194 of those killed were from the Netherlands.

Yesterday, a small group was able to visit part of the scene, while a group of 40 Dutch policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area. Some 90 Australian military police are on standby in London.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened.

US Ambassador to the Ukraine Jeffrey Pyatt said the crash site is ‘a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way.’ ‘Further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped. It’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured,’ he added.
