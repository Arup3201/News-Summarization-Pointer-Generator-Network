An elderly National Express passenger was today counting the cost after his Â£70,000 life savings were stolen from a bag left in the coach's hold.

The victim, a man aged in his 80s, had stowed the black hold-all stuffed with cash into the luggage area of the coach after getting off a flight at Heathrow Airport.

But by the time he reached the coach's final destination in Portsmouth, Hampshire, the money, which was in Australian dollars and Thai baht, was gone.

The man had brought the money over from his home in Thailand with a view to purchasing a property in the UK, a spokesman for Hampshire Police said.

They are urging shopkeepers and bankers to be vigilant of anyone trying to change a large quantity of the foreign currencies.

The coach left Heathrow at 4.45pm on Tuesday, stopping at Winchester by King Alfred's statue around 6.30pm, Southampton Coach station about 7.15pm.

Shortly after it stopped at Southampton University before arriving at The Hard in Portsmouth around 8pm, where the man discovered the money had been taken.

The spokesman said that it was when the man looked in the hold for his bag with the driver of the coach that he discovered it was missing.

PC Leigh Waller of Portsmouth Central police station said: 'We want to hear from anyone who was on the coach, to eliminate them from our investigation.

'We would also like to be contacted by anyone else who may have been at any of the stopping points along the journey.

'The bag may have been innocently taken as a mistake, but there was no replacement bag left in its place.

'In case the bag has been stolen, we'd also alert shopkeepers and bankers to the possibility the thief may try to change a large quantity of Australian dollars or Thai baht into UK currency in the near future.'
