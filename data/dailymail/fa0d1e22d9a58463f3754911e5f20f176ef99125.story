Swansea manager Garry Monk has urged striker Bafetimbi Gomis to build on his two-goal performance in the FA Cup against League Two side Tranmere.

The France international struck late on in the 6-2 third-round victory, but his overall display has given his manager encouragement for the future, especially with Wilfried Bony away at the African Nations Cup with Ivory Coast.

'Gomis probably hasn't had the amount of minutes he would have liked; he's still played of course but in terms of why I brought him to the club you could see it there today,' said Monk.

'Hopefully he takes it into this next period now, he will be the first choice, and he is ready to go and hopefully he produces performances like that.'

Nathan Dyer, on-loan Tottenham midfielder Tom Carroll and Gambian youngster Mo Barrow put the Swans into a comfortable lead just after half-time, before Max Power fortuitously benefited from charging down goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel's clearance.

However, Gomis and substitute Wayne Routledge struck - either side of Cole Stockton's header - to ensure there was no late drama.

'We were very comfortable and I thought we controlled the whole game,' added Monk.

'We managed to get some good goals and played some good football at a place where it can always be difficult.

'They got a couple of goals which could have made it tricky but we responded really well, but I think we controlled it from start to finish.'

Rovers boss Micky Adams has greater concerns than the FA Cup with his side second-bottom of League Two and admitted the gulf in class was too much to bridge without some luck, which they did not get.

'I think there are key moments in the game and my players are saying there is a definite handball for the first goal,' he said.

'If we come in at half-time at 0-0 it is a different game but, having said that, I thought Swansea's application and attitude was spot on - we were hoping to catch them on an off-day.

'When we are chasing the game the scoreline flatters them somewhat but that is the difference, that is what you pay all your money for goalscorers and they have had them today and they showed their quality.'
