Britain's public school leader has today hit out at top politicians for playing down the role played by fee-paying schools in helping poorer families and for 'demonising' private education.

Chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference has accused senior MPs of 'willful mischaracterisation' of independent schools while accusing ministers of failing to improve state education over the years.

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The existence of incredibly successful independent schools is an irritant to many Labour politicians, a puzzle to Liberal Democrats and, it often seems, an embarrassment to the Prime Minister.

'We are often damned with the faintest of praise, knowing that they cannot afford either financially or politically to dismantle us, whatever sabre-rattling they employ.'

He added that despite independent schools in the UK being 'the envy of the educational world, even though we are demonised by some here at home.'

Dr Ray's criticism comes at a time when the Government wants public schools to sponsor academies. But Dr Ray was also critical of academies claiming that their reliance on state funding means that they are not entirely independent.

He accused former Labour schools minister Lord Adonis of a lack of understanding of the independent sector after the peer called for independent schools to become more heavily involved in the academy system.

Dr Ray, High master of Manchester Grammar School since 2004, also warned that future governments may take away some of the freedom enjoyed by existing academies.

The Labour Government failed to improve standards at state schools according to Dr Ray, who says that their policy of pumping funds into the system merely created a mess.

According to Dr Ray, higher grade attainment at GCSE and A Level hid the fact that British youngsters were lagging behind their peers abroad in terms of performance.

A survey earlier this month found that more than half of parents would send their child to an independent school if they could afford it with privately educated students accounting for around 20 per cent of admissions to the top ten universities.

Private education is also said to save the government money in terms of funding extra state education according to supporters of the system and last year the sector provided nearly 40,000 children with bursaries of around Â£300milion.
