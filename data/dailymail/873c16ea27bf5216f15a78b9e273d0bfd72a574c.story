The party house in the Valley in 1995 film Clueless has gone on sale for $825,000.

The Grenada Hills property, which was listed on The Kate Christiansen Group as 'an amazing home' with 'beautiful curb appeal,' is where classic scenes from the movie take place, like when Cher gets beer spilled on her satin shoes, Murray shaves his head and Tai gets knocked out by a shoe.

Its claim to fame is undoubtedly the most remarkable quality of the five-bedroom California bungalow, even though there is no mention of the chick flick on the real estate website.

Iconic property: The party house in the Valley in 1995 film Clueless - where Cher has a drink spilled on her shoes, Murray shaves his head and Tai gets knocked out with a shoe - has gone on sale for $825,000

Among the house's amenities are a kitchen with granite countertops and 'beautiful cabinetry'.

Missing from this room, however, is the spherical ceiling light fixture that Tai sat under after being hit on the head with someone's flying shoe.

In the memorable scene, Elton, to make sure Tai doesn't have a concussion, sits her on the countertop and asks her to sing Rollin' With My Homies.

Today, instead of the round lamp, inset lightbulbs line the ceiling; the beige tiled floor that Tai fell onto, however, still remains the same.

One thing that remains very true to the movie is the home's exterior, with a set of steps leading up to the front door.

Of course, the house looks significantly different without the Christmas lights, wreaths and snowmen figurines that served as party decorations in the film.

In the backyard, where Cher takes a call from her angry father on her large Nineties cell phone, the same swimming pool can be found.

In this scene, a helicopter flies overhead as she tells her father she's 'just having a snack at my girlfriend's.'

'Where, in Kuwait?' he responds in a huff, to which she memorably says: 'Is that in the Valley?'

The backyard boasts the further addition of a water slide and a portico, which add to its California charm.
