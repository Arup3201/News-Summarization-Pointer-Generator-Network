Two mothers arranged a fight via Facebook and brawled outside a school after dropping off their children, a court heard yesterday.

Joanna McVey, 25, and Lorraine Couper, 30, fought near Dunblane Primary School after the online dispute.

Couper warned McVey that she should bring an AK47 assault rifle with her for the fight.

Yesterday, Stirling Sheriff Court heard that the vicious cat fight spilled on to a nearby road at nine o’clock in the morning.

The dispute apparently started after a falling out over who should have been invited to a party McVey had hosted.

Both mothers had been dropping their children off for school when the fight took place – and both were injured. McVey claimed she was left with a ‘sore face’ after being hit by a dog chain.

Following the fight, both McVey and Couper were charged – but proceedings against Couper were later dropped.

In court yesterday, Emma Whyte, prosecuting, said: ‘On the evening of 13 December, Miss Couper was at home using the internet to access a social networking site.

‘The accused was on the same site at her home. A text conversation took place in relation to a party the accused was having. The complainer was angry the accused didn’t invite a mutual friend and the conversation became heated.

‘The next day, the accused challenged the complainer to a fight and said, “Come on, then. We’ll sort this out now. Square go”. The complainer advised the accused she would not fight there but would elsewhere. A short time later, the accused approached Miss Couper and they engaged in a fight.’

Fight: The pair brawled close to Dunblane Primary School, Perthshire, the court was told

McVey, from Dunblane, Perthshire, admitted that, on December 14 last year she acted in a disorderly manner and challenged Couper to a fight, engaged in a fight and committed a breach of the peace.

A not guilty plea was accepted to a charge of assaulting Couper, repeatedly striking her on the head and body with a dog lead and making a threatening hand gesture.

Frazer McCready, defending, said: ‘This involved two women who should have known better and started with name calling over the internet on Facebook.

‘My client took her child to the school and met up with the complainer and it all spilled over.

‘When my client was interviewed by police, she said, “It was a square go, which she wanted. She was the one with the chain and I’m the one with the sore face. I don’t believe I got involved in this”.’

He read out a Facebook message from Couper to McVey on the night before the fight. It read: ‘Gie us a shout when your children are in bed. I’ll come round and we can sort this out.’ Another read: ‘You better bring your tomahawk, AK47 and a knife with you.’

Mr McCready said Couper had also been charged by police, ‘but for some reason The Crown decided not to proceed against her’.

Sheriff William Gilchrist fined McVey £190.
