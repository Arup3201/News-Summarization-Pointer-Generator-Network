A Cincinnati Bengals player was hit in the face and pushed down to earth by rival fans after trying to leap up to the bleachers and celebrate a touchdown.

Running back Jeremy Hill had just scored at an away game against the Cleveland Browns - his second touchdown of the match - and attempting the running leap towards waiting Bengals fans.

But Browns supporters spotted him and denied his attempt as he charged towards the bleachers. Two fans pushed him back down to earth - one making contact with the player's face. 

Pushed to the ground: Cleveland Browns fans too issue with Jeremy Hill's attempt to celebrate his second touchdown of the game

The incident did little to brighten the fortunes of the Browns, who did not score a single point in the clash at the FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, and lost 30-0.

Hill's touchdown came after a 16-yard run through the Browns defense. The first had been a more direct 2-yard run.

The successes had been predicted by Hill, whose side lost to the Browns 24-3 in their last clash - though the running back was adamant the victors in that game were 'worse' than expected and 'didn't do anything special'.

He kept his good humor despite the very physical put-down from the browns fans - who pointed and laughed afterwards. According to ESPN, Hill said: 'It was kind of funny - I'll learn from it next time.'

Time to fly? Running back Hill charged towards the end of the stadium after the 16-yard run, and went to leap towards the bleachers

Denied: The Cleveland Browns fans, who had little to celebrate, pushed Hill down, making contact with the player's face

Mockery: The Browns fans then pointed at Hill's face, triumphing in their minor victory
