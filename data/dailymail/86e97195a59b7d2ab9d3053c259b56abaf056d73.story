Popular storyline: Sunny Ormonde who plays Lillian Bellamy in The Archers. Producers caused outraged when they broadcast the outcome of her affair on Radio 4's sister station

When an Ambridge stalwart began an affair with her husband’s brother, regular listeners knew it was only a matter of time before they were treated to a huge marital showdown.

So dedicated fans of Radio 4 soap The Archers were understandably upset when BBC schedulers ruined months of suspense – and played the key scene on its digital spin-off show instead.

Hundreds of listeners have expressed their fury at being ‘cheated’ of the chance to follow the crucial story line to its conclusion.

Some pointed out the show is a favourite among older listeners, many of whom do not have access to a digital radio or the internet, while another said: ‘No point in listening to the Archers again, if one does not get all the story line.’

The showdown between property developer Matt Crawford and his wife Lilian Bellamy was played on Ambridge Extra, which was set up in 2011 to give Archers addicts behind-the-scenes material to supplement the main Radio 4 show.

The programme is broadcast on Radio 4 Extra, meaning it can only be accessed with a digital radio, through a digital television or online.

Since November, fans of the rural soap have been kept in suspense as Lilian continued a clandestine affair with Matt’s brother Paul.

Although the romance was cut short by Paul’s unexpected death from a heart attack last month, listeners were kept on tenterhooks by the knowledge that Matt had discovered his wife was unfaithful months earlier but chose to keep silent.

Last week, he finally confronted her with the knowledge, exclaiming: ‘Oh for God’s sake Lilian, stop lying. I know you were sleeping with Paul. I know you were screwing my brother, alright.’

However, the dramatic scene was heard by just a quarter of The Archers’ regular fans.

The main programme on Radio 4 is heard by an average of 5.1million listeners each week, while just 1.6million tune in to Radio 4 Extra.

Many of those who missed the scene wrote to the BBC’s own Radio 4 programme Feedback – which regularly discusses listeners’ views – to complain.

One said: ‘I’m outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the Archers has been deprived of listening to this scene…I think people who listen to the Archers on ordinary steam or FM radio should have been able to hear this scene.

'If we can’t hear the scenes for ourselves, we might as well just read the summaries and not bother with the radio at all. Is this what the BBC want?’

Others took to online fan forums to air their discontent.

One said: ‘Thousands of Archers fans are of an age where they neither have, now want, a computer/laptop/tablet/smartphone (talking loo, radio toothbrush, or any other gizmo), so they are missing out on these plotlines.’

A second added: ‘‘Thumbs down to the Archer’s producer for putting the Lillian & Matt storyline on Ambridge Extra.

'I'm outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the Archers has been deprived of listening to this scene.'

Angry Archers fan

'I am regular listener of Archers and very angry at this after hearing it on BBC Feedback. No point in listening to the Archers again, if one does not get all the story line.’

A third said: ‘Join in the protest. Switch off your radio at 7.05 every day next week in protest of producers switching main story-lines from The Archers to Ambridge Radio 4 Extra.’

Stand-in Archers editor Julie Beckett, who took over from Vanessa Whitburn in May, defended the scheduling decision to Feedback.

She said: ‘Almost everybody I believe has access to digital television and Ambridge Extra is available on there.

'What we wanted to do was to take this lovely moment and project us into a story which will in fact be carried on both series this time.

'So you will be hearing aspects of the story in Ambridge Extra and in the Archers.

‘Those listeners who listen to both will get the whole story, but if you listen to one or the other you will hopefully get a satisfying story there as well.

Outcry: The BBC defended the scheduling decision to Feedback

'If you do feel frustrated by that [not hearing the scene] there are plenty of places you can go and hear that moment.’

But one listener said: ‘I’ve got internet, but I never knew - till today - that the R4Extra stuff was anything other than tongue-in-cheek alternative episodes!

'If I had known, I’d have certainly set my DAB to record the “Extra” progs. Now I feel very definitely cheated out of who knows what extra plotlines that really should have been mainstream Archers, not R4Extra!!’

Now in its fifth series Ambridge Extra airs two 15-minute episodes every week to supplement the main programme, which is aired daily on Radio 4.

When it was created in 2011, the BBC said it would run ‘in parallel’ with the main show and promised listeners would not miss out on vital plotlines if they did not listen to the digital series.
