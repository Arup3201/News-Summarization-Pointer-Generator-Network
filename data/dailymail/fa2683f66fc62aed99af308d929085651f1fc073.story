Winter finally arrived in parts of Britain yesterday, threatening to put a chill in the tail of the hottest year for more than 350 years.

Widespread frosts gave the landscape a Christmas card look while temperatures are forecast to plunge as low as minus 6C (21F) overnight on Saturday, with snow on high ground.

But even as the cold spell began, 2014’s topsy-turvy weather had nature in a spin with cherry trees in blossom, frogs already spawning and daffodils in bloom several months early, while many of the summer’s roses are still in bloom.

Chilly: Temperatures will slump as low as -6C overnight on Saturday following on from -5C last night, making it the coldest of the year so far

Frosty fields: Despite this wintery scene this morning forecasters say that 2014 is on track to be the warmest since records began in 1659

Retired office worker Marilyn Fenn was stunned to spot a daffodil blooming in her garden this week, three months early. T

he 62-year-old widow, of Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, said: ‘It looks so lonely, I actually feel a bit sorry for it. 

'I don’t know how long it will last with the cold weather.’ 

Records show that the year is set to be the warmest since records began in 1659. The Met Office said average temperatures from the beginning of January to late November were 1.6C (2.9F) above the long-term norm.

The figures are based on Central England Temperature data. It has recorded monthly temperatures across an area between Lancaster, Bristol and London since 1659.

For the whole UK, 2014 is the warmest in records dating back to 1910.

The year’s crazy weather saw the wettest winter to strike southern England since records began in 1766, with severe flooding in Somerset, Kent and the Thames Valley suffering extreme flooding.

Temperatures then hit 19C (66F) in the South in March, when the average is 9C (48F).

A July heatwave roared in, with temperatures in the mid-30s (over 90F), but it was swiftly followed by the coolest August for 21 years as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha crossed the Atlantic bringing with it downpours and flash floods – just in time to catch the school holidays.

After this, the driest-ever September preceded the warmest Halloween on record.

Experts say that while a bitterly cold December could still knock 2014 off its top spot in the list of warmest years, this is unlikely.

While all months except August have seen above average temperatures, no single month has seen a record-breaking high. Instead the year has been consistently warm. 

Can't make its mind up: This year has seen a July heatwave followed by the coolest August for 21 years and then the driest September ever

Don't jinx it: Meteorologists say that a bitter December cold snap could stop 2014 being the hottest year on record, but this is unlikely

Across the world, the year is also on track to be one of the hottest, with global temperatures around 0.57C (1.03F) above the average 14C (57.2F) from January to October, just ahead of the previous record of 0.56C, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. 

However, the Met Office said that a single year’s extreme weather cannot be attributed to man-made global warming.

A spokesman said: ‘One warm year does not necessarily say anything about long-term climate change – these trends need to be looked at over longer timescales of several decades.’

But global warming does make it more likely to have years with hotter-than-average weather, he said.

Global: Last year is also set to be the warmest across the globe as temperature rises pushed the average 0.57C above the average of 14C

Heating up: Average temperatures from the beginning of January to late November were 1.6C (2.9F) above the long-term norm
