A filmmaker and Playgirl 'Man Of The Year' centerfold model who made waves when he came out as gay has died.

Dirk Shafer, 52, was found dead in his car in West Hollywood on Thursday after a possible heart attack, Deadline reports.

He became a pioneering mouthpiece on the subject of gay lifestyle and the heated circuit club scene in the 1990s. 

Man Of The Year: Dirk Shafer, 52, was Playgirl's 1992 Man Of The Year before he came out as gay and spoke out about the pressures on men to appear straight. He has been found dead in his car in West Hollywood

A fixture of Hollywood, and trainer to the stars, Shafer rubbed shoulders with the likes of Joan Rivers

Will & Grace star Eric McCormack paid tribute to his friend, gym buddy and one-time co-star Shafer on Twitter

Among those to pay tribute was Will & Grace star Eric McCormack, who trained with Shafer. 

He wrote: 'Lost a good man today. #DirkShafer dear pal and awesome trainer for 17 years. Sending love to his family and so many friends. Be at peace, D'

Satirizing the need to appear 'straight' in his modeling career, Shafer directed, wrote and starred in the acclaimed mockumentary Man Of The Year in 1995.

Later in life: Shafer went on to make two acclaimed movies, dabbled in acting and physically trained stars

Six years later, his movie about the gay club scene, Circuit, was awarded Best Film at the Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival.

Illinois-born Shafer later landed a role as Blaze on the hit sitcom Will & Grace, before becoming a fitness trainer in Hollywood.

His celebrity clients at Swapoutworkout included Katy Perry,  Richard Dreyfuss, and Tiffanni Thiessen.

In 2012, Shafer posed naked once more for Playgirl to mark 20 years since his centerfold.
