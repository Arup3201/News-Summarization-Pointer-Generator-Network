A retired doctor has been ordered to pull down his dream five-bedroom home after planning bosses ruled it was 'overbearing'.

Mohammed Sidda, 67, fell foul of planning regulations in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and must now pay £120,000 to demolish the entire detached house.

At April’s hearing at Bolton Town Hall, Dr Sidda’s barrister claimed the issue was due to the fact he had been ill and that his inexperienced son had been left to project manage the construction.

But after weeks of deliberation, government planning inspector Richard Perrins threw out the appeal, saying the development had caused 'unacceptable harm to the character and appearance' of the area.

He insisted the demolition order must be carried out in the next six months.

Dr Margaret Collier, chairman of Lostock Residents’ Group, said: 'This has been a very difficult situation for the applicant and neighbours alike.

'Neighbours did not object to the plans 
as approved. What was built was so much bigger that it was against the 
council’s policies.

'Because of this, Bolton’s officers and councillors determined that the building had to be demolished.

'Neighbours are relieved that the planning inspector has upheld the view of Bolton Council.'

Dr Sidda had a bungalow bulldozed on the site and had the new house built in 2011.

A Bolton Council spokesman said: 'We understand that Dr Sidda has invested a lot of money in this development, and sympathise with his circumstances.

'Nevertheless, planning regulations are in place to protect local residents and the environment against inappropriate developments.

'This property differs significantly from the plans approved, and the Inspector has agreed with the council and local residents that as a result it is unacceptable in its setting, and the only remedy is for it to be demolished.'

Bolton Council planning officer Andrew McGlone said: 'It has an overbearing nature, not only (when seen) from Regent Road but from two minor highways either side of the site.'

Dr Sidda had worked for the NHS for 34 years before retiring on medical grounds and had undergone a kidney transplant.

Dr Sidda was not available for comment.
