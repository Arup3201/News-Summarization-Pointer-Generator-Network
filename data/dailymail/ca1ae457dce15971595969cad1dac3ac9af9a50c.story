Treasurer Joe Hockey used his own wealthy electorate of North Sydney as an example as to why it was important to introduce a $7 co-payment for visits to the doctor. 

After the Federal Government's Budget in May, Mr Hockey said: 'I want to emphasise my electorate of North Sydney has one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia and I have one of the wealthiest electorates in Australia'.

'To me there is something wrong with that.'

But it turns out Mr Hockey's figures were way off the mark. His wealthy electorate on Sydney's North Shore is actually in the bottom 20 per cent of bulk-billers, which is the term used to describe visits to the doctor or hospital paid for by the taxpayer-funded Medicare.

Joe Hockey defended the $7 GP co-payment by claiming 'I want to emphasise my electorate of North Sydney has one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia'. New figures supplied to a Senate Committee from the Department of Human Services suggest it's quite the opposite

The latest Department of Human Services figures available (from 2013) show that bulk-billing rates in Mr Hockey's electorate are  126th out of 150.

This same information was provided to a Federal Government Senate Committee on bulk-billing rates around the country.

Bulk-billed: The table (above) shows that Mr Hockey's electorate is actually 126th out of 150 electorates, not as the Treasurer claimed 'one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia'

As the table shows, the areas with a high percentage of bulk-billing are in the lower socio-economic areas of Sydney's western and south-western suburbs.

Most of those electorates are Labor-held seats. Just one, Lindsay in outer western Sydney, is held by the Coalition.

Mr Hockey's North Sydney electorate ranks 126 out of 150.

Labor's Shadow Minister for Health, Catherine King said: 'Joe Hockey is completely out of touch on the health needs of Australians'.

Shadow Health Minister Catherine King says 'the GP Tax hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs'

'Contrary to the Treasurer’s claim, his electorate does not have one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia, it has one of the lowest,' Ms King said.

'The GP Tax hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs, mostly in the outer suburbs and regional and rural communities. The very people Joe Hockey thinks also won’t pay his petrol tax because they don’t drive.'

'Scrapping bulk-billing and hitting low and middle income Australians, poor, pensioners, children and the chronically ill.'

In Ed Husic's area of Chifley in western Sydney, 99 per cent of doctors' visits were bulk-billed. The figures show of 1,457,609 patient visits, 1,444,598 were not charged.

The next four areas are all  Labor-held seats in Western Sydney, where just about every visit to the GP was paid for by bulk-billing.

This in contrast to Mr Hockey's electorate, where only 72 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed.

Ms King said that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told a recent Senate Out of Pocket Health expenses inquiry ‘there is good evidence to suggest that there is a negative economic impact with patients using more expensive health care through the hospital system that could be delivered by general practice at a fraction of the cost’.

Health Minister Peter Dutton has fired another salvo at Senators planning to block the bill, suggesting it will lead to a smaller Medical Research Future fund.

Health Minister Peter Dutton is warning any scrapping of the co-payment will damage the plans for a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund

Medicare was established in 1984 replacing the old Medibank system, which had its beginnings in 1975 under the Whitlam Labor Government

'The medical research future fund without the co-payment will be much smaller, no doubt about that,' he said.

The government claims that $5 of the $7 co-payment will be put towards the establishing of a $20 billion fund.

'If the co-payment falls over, then that is going to be a big blow to the medical research fund.'

The Treasurer, though, is coming under fire from all angles, including internally.

After being cut loose by senior Cabinet ministers, including the PM, over his 'poor people don't drive' claim, there are revelations today that he also had to be pulled into line by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a party room meeting.

The altercation stemming from a verbal assault Joe Hockey reportedly launched against WA Liberal Premier Colin Barnett over GST revenue.
