A mother lost nearly four stone on a liquid diet after her husband told her: 'You look more like your mother every day.'

Janet Nadolski, 48, from Stratford-Upon-Avon, ballooned to over 14 stone due to her fondness forÂ  biscuits and puddings - and her husband feared she'd end up like her size-24 mother.

Finance manager Janet told how her love of sweet food all changed when husband Peter, 52, made the 'cruel to be kind' comment.

Janet said: 'I love my mum dearly but she has never watched her weight and is very happy to be curvy.

'It just wasn't part of her generation to think about calories and portions because she loves her food.'

'When I was younger she would make fresh bread and the best steamed puddings you've ever tasted.

'She is 85 now and eats what she wants to and wouldn't even think she had a weight problem anyway.

'But I was deeply unhappy and so fed up with being fat. The way I dealt with stress was by eating a bar of chocolate.

'I would often skip meals and eat food that was fast and convenient and, most of the time, unhealthy.

'I loved takeaways too and would have huge portions. I adored Snickers, Mars Bars and Cadbury's Dairy Milk too.

'I was bursting out of my clothes and I knew I was getting old beyond my years.

'It was the icing on the cake when my husband said I looked like my mother.

She is almost 85 and is a size 24.'

It was the turning point for 5ft 7in Janet who had tried every diet - including GI Diet, Atkins, and Weight Watchers.

She said: 'I was struggling to get into size 18 clothing. I was so uncomfortable. I just knew I had to do something.'

In 2010 a colleague recommend Janet try a very low-calorie diet called LighterLife.

Food is completely replaced by four meal packs a day in the form of shakes, soups and bars.

Janet lost nearly four stone after her husband's joke, and says life has been 'transformed'

Janet swapped her normal daily diet of 3,000 calories with meal replacements totalling 600 calories.

She says: 'Of course it wasn't easy giving up my favourite foods like chocolate and takeways. But in the first week I lost 5lbs.'

In six months Janet lost three-and-a-half stone and shrank to a size 12.

She was even asked to model clothes at a charity show and strutted her stuff on a catwalk in front of 300 people wearing clothes from a local boutique.

She says: 'Wearing a slinky dress and walking down the catwalk was a huge boost to my confidence. It felt truly wonderful.

'My husband Peter says I look amazing and he is now always telling me how proud he is of me.

'My life has been transformed and losing weight has given me the confidence to try new things and conquer life's challenges.

'I never imagined I would be in demand to model on a catwalk!

'It's funny looking back how my husband's cruel joke turned my life around. From couch potato to catwalk model. How can I complain about that?'
