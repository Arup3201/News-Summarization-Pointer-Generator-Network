A police community support officer who raped a 12-year-old schoolgirl was today jailed for ten years.

Michael Yardley, 35, had a seven-month affair with the child before his shocked wife Stephanie caught them kissing and cuddling on the sofa in the living room of the marital home.

The PCSO, employed by Lincolnshire Police, was caught out after getting up early to tell his wife he was going for a run, according to Andrew Scott, prosecuting.

Instead he went downstairs and let the girl into the house. His wife later went downstairs and caught them kissing on the sofa.

The couple separated and Yardley's wife later raised her suspicions with his employers, sparking an investigation.

Both Yardley and the girl, who was by then 13, admitted having sex with each other on several occasions both 
at Yardley's home and in his car.

The girl, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, told police they had agreed between them that they would 
set up home together when she reached 18.

Mr Scott said: 'He befriended this 
girl and took advantage of her. Her parents trusted him and did not 
consider for one moment that anything untoward was happening.'

Yardley had previously laughed off 
suggestions that the girl had a crush on him and even managed to 
convince her father that nothing was wrong, despite the fact that he 
discovered she had sent 200 text messages to him.

Yardley, of Morton, Lincolnshire, 
admitted raping the girl on October 27, 2010 when she was 12 and four 
charges of sexual activity with a young girl between November 2010 and 
April this year.

He was jailed for ten years and placed on the sex offenders' register for life.

Yardley quit his role as a PCSO after the offences came to light.

Recorder John Philpotts told him: 'These offences are extremely grave because of her age and the difference in age between you.

'Her parents thought their child was safe in your care. They were mistaken.

'You used the fact that her parents trusted you to take care of her. You used that to abuse her in the most disgraceful fashion.

'Your behaviour was persistent and it was prolonged. This has devastated the victim's family. The long-term emotional and psychological effects on the victim can only be guessed. I have no doubt they will be serious and considerable.'

Alison Summers, defending, said Yardley developed a friendship with the girl after becoming unhappy in his marriage.

She said: 'He realised he shouldn't have married. He felt his life was out of control. It was against that background of personal crisis that it would appear that his judgement was lost.

'I can only relate his remorse and his shame.'

Detective Inspector Guy Leach said described Yardley as 'a very dangerous person to young girls'

He said: 'Yardley has taken advantage and abused the trust of friends and a young girl. As a consequence of his conduct,the childhood and adolescence of this young girl has been stolen.'
