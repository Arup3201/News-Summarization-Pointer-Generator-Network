Jailed former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was beaten so brutally in prison she feared she would be killed - her daughter has claimed.

Mrs Tymoshenko released photographs last month, showing bruises to her arms, legs and stomach.

Her daughter Eugenia claims guards punched the opposition leader and twisted her arms and legs with such ferocity she thought she was going to die.

Fears: Yulia Tymoshenko thought she was 'in the last moments of her life' during the 'attack', her daughter said

The beating is alleged to have 
occurred on the evening of April 20, while prison guards transferred her
to hospital to be treated for back pain.

Miss Timoshenko told the Guardian:
'They started moving towards her and surrounded her bed. They first 
moved everyone from the building and removed her neighbour. My mother 
felt these were the last minutes of her life.

'They
grabbed a thick woollen blanket from her bed, pulling her off the bed. 
She managed to stick her hand out and resisted, protecting her life. The
vice-head then punched her in the stomach.

'She
couldn't breath after the punch. She started screaming, when they were 
bringing her out of the building. She passed out in the ambulance. She 
recovered conscious in hospital. She refused everything. She took only 
painkillers.'

Video: Eugenia has called on authorities to release surveillance footage of the 'attack'

Miss Tymoshenko claims her mother's cell is subject to 24 hour surveillance and that the authorities could release tapes showing what happened.

But Ukrainian prosecutors have denied harming the opposition leader, insisting her injuries were self-inflicted.

Tymoshenko has been on hunger strike since the incident and her daughter said she is 'very physically weak' as she approaches two weeks without food.

The only thing keeping her going is the support of western governments who are threatening to boycott this summer's European Championships in Ukraine in protest at her treatment.

Controversial: Yulia Tymoshenko during her trial last year

German president Angela Merkel 
announced this weekend she and other members of her cabinet would not 
attend any matches unless Mrs Tymoshenko was released.

Austria
has also vowed to stay away and Belgium has followed suit, insisting 
Mrs Tymoshenko should be allowed medical treatment and visits.

Elsewhere, on Tuesday U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton called for the jailed politician to be freed.

The show of solidarity is 'keeping her going,' Miss Tymoshenko said.

The 51-year-old became a global icon of democratic change during Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and swept into power the following year.

Last year she was jailed for seven years on charges of abusing her powers in a Russian energy deal.

Her prosecution and trial were widely criticised by the west.

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed concerns over the conviction, the Council of Europe expressed 'serious concern about the trial' and Amnesty International called for Tymoshenko's immediate release.
