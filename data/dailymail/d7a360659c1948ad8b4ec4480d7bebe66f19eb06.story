From Instagram to Snapchat, photo sharing apps have taken the digital world by storm.

Today everyone can be a photographer as we snap, edit and share our best views with the world.

And now, one photographer is taking the photo sharing concept one step further with new site PhotoYOLO designed to deliver photographs from complete strangers to your inbox.

Sharing: A new site called PhotoYOLO sends subscribers a photo of a stranger from anywhere in the world every single day

The concept behind the site is simple: 
sign up using your email address and every day a random photo will be delivered
 to your inbox from somebody that you don't know.

The service, set up by travel and lifestyle 
photographer, Kaitlyn Reed, is inspired by The Listserve,
 a lottery where the winner gets the opportunity to write something and 
share it with the world.

PhotoYOLO describes itself as: 'One photo a 
day in your inbox, from a friend you just haven't met yet.'

One day you could receive a photo of a cute kitten from someone in Australia, and the next day you could open your inbox to a snap of the beautiful beaches of Thailand.

And one day you could be chosen to send your photo to every single subscriber.

Describing her new brainchild, Kaitlyn writes: 'A subscriber is chosen each day to share one photo they've taken with the world. What will you share?

'I believe that photos can tell stories too, here's your chance to tell yours.'

Speaking to MailOnline, Kaitlyn said: 'I launched the project less than a month ago. It started as a fun little project amongst friends, but the subscription list kept growing!

'Being a photographer, I often wished there was something like daily lotto, but for photos. I googled and couldn't find anything out there, so I made it!

'In each PhotoYOLO a website link of the winner's choosing is attached to their photo. Often times it's their blog, projects, but sometimes it's charities.'

And the Twittersphere seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept.

One user wrote: 'So far I'm loving this > "One photo a day in your inbox, from a friend you just haven't met yet.'

Another added: '@gtmcknight AWESOME Photoyolo today!! Thank you! (Costa Rica is awesome, too!).'

What will you receive today? One day you could receive a cute animal, and the next a lovely scenic snap from anywhere in the world

While concerns may be raised that the site could go the same way as photo sharing app Snapchat, which saw users sending explicit photos to one another, user Laura Beck says this won't be the case.

She writes on Jezebel: 'Well, it could be creepy, but it's well-curated so you're not receiving a photo of a different penis every day.

'Or any penises ever. Not that penises can't be beautiful and artistic. The point is — this is about cool photography, not unclothed penises.'

Kaitlyn added: 'I'm putting my trust into this little community I'm creating, so I believe everything has been, and will be tasteful.

'Of course, if it turns into a ChatRoulette, monitoring might have to be enforced…. because nobody wants that in their inbox at work!'

Tweet fans: The Twittersphere seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept, which could see users receiving all sorts of amazing photography from across the globe on a daily basis

Photo sharing is big business. Snapchat, which launched in late 2011 and lets user send snaps to others for less than ten seconds, has already raised around £40 million in venture capital funding.

Over 200 million pictures are shared on the service daily and the company is valued at around £534 million.

Instagram, a photo editing and sharing app announced in February that they had 100 million active users, only two and a half years after first launching.
