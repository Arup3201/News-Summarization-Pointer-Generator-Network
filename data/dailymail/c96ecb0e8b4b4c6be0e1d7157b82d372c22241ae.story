Justina Pelletier, the Connecticut teenager 'kidnapped' by hospital staff 16 months ago, finally returned home to her family today.

The grinning 16-year-old was freed from the secure unit she’d been held at after her parents dramatically won custody on Tuesday.

'I’m so happy. I’m so excited,' Justina said, as she celebrated her first taste of freedom.

Wheelchair-bound Justina spoke briefly outside the Thompson, Connecticut, residential unit she had been living in for the past month just after 10am.

As her mother Linda loaded up the car with her belongings, Justina said she couldn’t wait to get home to see her friends, play with her beloved dogs, soak in the swimming pool and enjoy lazy mornings lolling around in bed.

And Justina’s overjoyed father Lou told Mail Online: 'We are just so happy our daughter is finally coming home.

'It has been 16 months of torture but finally justice is being done.'

As Justina left the facility, family spokesman the Rev. Patrick Mahoney told waiting news teams: 'We are so thankful and thrilled that Justina is at long last being returned to the loving arms of her family.

'The Pelletiers are relieved their 16-month nightmare is finally over. Now Justina can begin the healing process.'

But commenting on her deteriorating health, The Rev Mahoney added: 'Sixteen months ago Justina was ice skating, now she can’t walk.'

The family plans to spend a quiet day settling Justina back into their five-bedroom home on a leafy street in upmarket West Hartford.

Just before her release, Justina said she couldn’t wait to get into the family swimming pool and play with her beloved dogs.

Like most teenagers, she’s also looking forward to sleeping late and getting together with her pals.

Sharing her story: Journalists and local media gathered for a news conference today as Justina was freed

Justina’s Kafka-esque plight, revealed by Mail Online last year, began when she went down with flu in February 2013.

She
 suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle wasting 
illness, but as her regular doctor was away, he told her mom Linda to 
take her to Boston Children’s Hospital.

After she was admitted, experts re-diagnosed her, saying she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental illness.

When Justina’s parents protested, hospital staff called welfare workers, who won custody.

Justina was locked in a psychiatric ward, taken off stabilizing medication and only allowed to see her family once a week as her family battled the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter.

Ice skating fanatic Justina’s health deteriorated rapidly and she is now unable to walk. 

'They are sadists and psychiatry is the devil as far as I am concerned. My daughter was used as a lab rat, a cruel experiment'

But her parents and three older sisters, Jennifer, Jessica and Julia, are cautiously optimistic that they can nurse her back to the health.

'We’re going to keep her home-coming low key,' financial planner Lou told Mail Online.

'I know her sisters want to throw a big party for her but we need to get her settled and give her time to breath.

'Her condition has deteriorated terribly since she was taken from us. She’s no longer jumping jacks and ice skating, she is paralyzed.

'She needs time to adjust to being home and I think she wants that to be low key. We need to help her back to health.

'She has been sleep deprived – forced to get up at 7am every morning and not takes the naps she needs – and I think she just wants to settle back into her old bedroom.

'I am still very angry at the psychiatrists, Boston Children’s Hospital and the Department of Families and Children for putting Justina through this.

'They are sadists and psychiatry is the devil as far as I am concerned. My daughter was used as a lab rat, a cruel experiment.

'Now they need other lab rats – well they’ll struggle. We finally beat the system and they cannot do that to anyone else.

'They tried to gag me, to prevent me from telling what was going on. Can you imagine what would have happened to Justina if I hadn’t gone public?

'I went to a rally at Massachusetts State House recently. People were coming up to shake my hand, saying if it wasn’t for me, the same thing would have happened to their son or daughter.

'It won’t bring back the 16 months that Justina was away. But at least we have her back again now.'

Lou, 57, admitted there were times that he feared Justina would never return home.

But after numerous rulings against the family, Massachusetts Judge Joseph Johnston suddenly ruled she could be freed on Tuesday.

He had relaxed the ultra-tight visitation rights earlier in the month, allowing Justina to visit her home for the first time on Father’s Day.

And after his ruling Tuesday, her mum was able to take her out of the JRI Susan Wayne Center for Excellence for a celebration steak dinner.

Linda, who had been staying in a nearby motel, said she screamed with joy when she heard Justina was finally being released.

'Unbelievable', she told the Boston Globe. 'It’s been such a long journey.'

Once her health is back on track Justina, who has missed 16 months of schooling, plans to go to Washington DC to lobby lawmakers.

She intends to push for 'Justina’s Law' to make sure that no other child admitted to hospital is ever taken into custody in the same way.

Justina intends to brush up on her politics and enlist her local legislators to promote her cause.

'This is only the beginning,' her father said. 'There’s going to be a Justina’s Law.'
