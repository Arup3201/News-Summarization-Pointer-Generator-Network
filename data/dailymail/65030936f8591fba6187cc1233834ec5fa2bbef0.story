Tribunal: Dr Arun Singhal, 65, allegedly told a depressed woman patient in Huyton, Liverpool , that he would only sign a sick note for her if she paid for it

 

A FAMILY doctor stunned a suicidal patient by telling her: ‘You can go and jolly well do it now,’ a medical tribunal was told.

Dr Arun Singhal, 65, is said to have twice advised the woman to kill herself during medical consultations, adding: ‘If you don’t know how to do it, it’s on the internet.’

The GP is also said to have told the patient she was a ‘disgrace’ and even added a false entry on her records claiming she had threatened to kill him.

The distraught patient used a mobile phone to secretly record some of his comments during one of the consultations and he is now facing a disciplinary hearing.

Yesterday she sobbed as she recalled how she had to gasp for breath when her family doctor advised her to kill herself during a row at his surgery.

The woman, who is in her 30s, had warned Singhal she was contemplating suicide after learning she was to be called to give evidence as a witness in a rape trial. She was concerned that some of her neighbours were involved in the case.

The hearing listened to the recording of their conversation in which the doctor refused to give her a sick note excusing her from appearing in court unless she paid him privately.

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester was told the incidents took place over two consultations in 2011 after the woman – known as Patient A – registered with Singhal’s surgery.

She had suffered various mental health issues and had initially gone to see Singhal claiming her anti-depressant medication was not working and she was feeling suicidal. 

As she was leaving the surgery in Huyton, Liverpool, she thought she heard the doctor urging her to commit suicide, saying: ‘You should go home and kill yourself.’

She told the hearing: ‘At the time I was feeling really depressed and it wasn’t until I got home that I thought, I’m sure he told me to go and kill myself when he patted me.’

A further consultation was booked in December 2011 after Patient A was asked to give evidence in the rape trial and she decided to record the meeting in sceret. In the recording played to the hearing, the doctor and Patient A are heard arguing about the sick note, before she said: ‘I’m going to commit suicide.’

The doctor replied: ‘You can go and jolly well do it now; if you don’t know how to do it, it’s on the internet.’ 

Surgery: The woman, who was on antidepressants, taped her appointment with Dr Singhal in Huyton, Liverpool

She said: ‘You’re my doctor and you’re telling me to kill myself? I’m suicidal!’ The doctor replied: ‘You are trying to blackmail me. If you are suicidal, you should go and do it.’

The woman then called him ‘a disgrace of a doctor’, and he said: ‘You’re a disgrace to be a patient.’

Asked why she had taped the second consultation, she said: ‘I was feeling very suicidal. ‘I knew he had said it to me previously. I thought he might say it again.’

Singhal is also accused of failing to include a reference to the woman’s expression of suicidal intent in her patient notes and even added a false entry claiming she had threatened to kill him.

Boyd Morwood, for the General Medical Council, said: ‘Quite clearly, if the doctor is found to have said these words to Patient A, the GMC’s case is that this would be an abrogation of his position of trust, present a danger to Patient A because of her vulnerable position and undermine her trust in the profession.’

The hearing, which is expected to last five days, is going ahead in the doctor’s absence after the panel heard he did not wish to take part.
