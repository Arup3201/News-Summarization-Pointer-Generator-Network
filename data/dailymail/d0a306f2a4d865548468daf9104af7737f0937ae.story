These are the amazing scenes when a wildlife photographer in Russia thought he was about to get some unbelievable images of a female bear and her cubs on the banks of a river. 

The unnamed photographer is equipped with a wide-angled and long lens - which is even covered in camouflage. 

The bear and her three cubs walk just a few feet in front of the photographer as he captures images on both of his cameras. 

However, Andrey Kireev, 44, from Moscow, was volunteering in South Kamchatka Wildlife park, when he spotted the potential danger.

While the first photographer concentrates on the bears in front of him, he is completely oblivious to the second bear approaching from behind. 

Fortunately, the second bear was not interested in the photographer who survived the potentially fatal encounter unscathed.

The bears had just emerged from the treeline on their way to the edge of the river in the South Kamchatka Wildlife Sanctuary

The three bears take a rest on the river bank just a foot from the water while the photographer continues to document proceedings 

Yet, while he concentrates fully on the bear and her three cubs in front of him, the photographer is completely unaware of the new threat
