Finally brought to justice? Robert Honsch was arrested in Ohio Tuesday, where he lived under a new name with a new family. His old wife and daughter were murdered in 1995 and only 19 years later have police found their suspect

A perplexing investigation into the murder of an Upstate New York mother and daughter that spans three other states and nearly two decades may finally have a resolution.

Police on Tuesday arrested Robert Honsch for the 1995 murders of his daughter Elizabeth, 17, and wife Marcia. He'd been living in Ohio under the assumed name Robert Tyree along with a new wife and children.

Elizabeth's body was found wrapped in plastic bags and a sleeping bag near a New Britain, Connecticut shopping center. The body of her mother, 53, was found by a hiker a week earlier near a Massachusetts park.

Both died from a gunshot wound to the head.

Police
 say the case never officially went cold, but a phone call made last 
month from Virginia Beach to police in New York became the linchpin that
 allowed investigators to finally move forward in the 19-year-old case.

The
 mysterious tip was a missing persons report to New York authorities 
that came nearly 20 years too late for reasons police will not reveal.

'This
 has been an intensive investigation, it has never stopped,' New Britain
 Police Chief James Wardell told the Hartford Courant. 'We don't give up
 on any case. It does not matter how old the case is.'

The
 tip, which police revealed came from a family member, finally allowed 
them to put a name to the bodies of Elizabeth and Marcia.

Until now they had gone unidentified.

Neither
 body had identifying information, but examination of clothing and other
 items found at the scenes suggested they were from New York.

Slain: Elizabeth, 17, was discovered wrapped in plastic bags and a sleeping bag behind a New Britain, Connecticut shopping center in 1995. Her mother, Honsch's 53-year-old wife Marcia, was found dead a week earlier in Massachusetts. Both suffered gunshot wounds to the head

Troopers
 began a missing-persons investigation into the disappearance of a 
mother and daughter from the New York City suburb of Brewster, and 
collaboration with authorities in Massachusetts and Connecticut 
determined their identities.

This then led them to Mr. Honsch, who was tracked to Dalton, Ohio. He was living there under an assumed name with a new family.

They had last lived in Brewster with Robert Honsch. Authorities said Robert Honsch was found living under an assumed name with his current wife and children and was interviewed at his Ohio home before taken into custody on a murder charge Tuesday.

Authorities said examination of items found near Elizabeth Honschâ€™s body connected him to the scene.

New Britain, Connecticut, police said Wednesday they and Massachusetts State Police have separate arrest warrants charging Honsch with murder.

He was being held in Wooster, Ohio, and is expected to be arraigned there Thursday before being moved to Massachusetts.

Unthinkable: Police say Honsch stashed his daughter's body behind this Connecticut shopping center. IN 2007, three more bodies would be found right around the same area, but the incidents are believed to be unrelated
