Another game, another excellent referee - this time Turkey's Cuneyt Cakır - turning in a weak performance.

First there was a huge kick on Wesley Sneijder’s achilles by Martín Demichelis which escaped a caution and moments later Bruno Martins Indi blatantly body checked Lionel Messi but again no yellow card.

That Martins Indi was cautioned just on half time did nothing to suggest laws might be applied correctly and sure enough Stefan De Vrij committed another body check in the second minute of the second half and was not shown a card.

No action: Martin Demichelis checks on Holland's Wesley Sneijder after the Argentine's Achilles tackle

Blatant: Holland's Bruno Martins Indi got away with a deliberate body check on Lionel Messi

Punished: Martins Indi was substituted soon after he was finally booked by Cuneyt Cakir

Cuneyt is a strict referee who follows instructions; Nani’s dismissal at Old Trafford against Bayern Munich showed that.

FIFA deny that they have 'instructed' referees to perform this way but what I have witnessed throughout this competition is very good and experienced referees appearing to do their jobs in 'FIFA handcuffs' – restricting the correct use of the red and yellow cards that law demands.

More injuries may follow and the final could again be spoiled by excessive physical challenges being allowed.

Off Scott free: Stefan de Vrij (left) went unpunished for a body check in the second half

Eventually: Cakir booked Demichelis after a foul on Arjen Robben

The Turkish semi-final referee eventually gave three yellow cards

Argentina's Martin Demichelis and Holland's Bruno Martins Indi were booked but should have been punished earlier in the match

FIFA says they haven't advised referees to do so, but the officials appear to be acting too leniently
