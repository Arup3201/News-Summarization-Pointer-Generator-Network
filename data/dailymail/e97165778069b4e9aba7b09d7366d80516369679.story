Chicago police have used DNA evidence to link two crimes carried out eight years apart and the person responsible for both offenses could still be at large.

Both crimes are more than 10 years old. The older of the two crimes took place in 1992, when an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered.

Holly Staker was babysitting two younger children in Waukegan, Illinois, when she was murdered.

The crime was very high profile at the time and the man found guilty, Juan Rivera, then in his late teens, was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the crime.

Despite a lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime scene, Rivera was convicted on the strengthen of his confession which police said included details that only the killer would have known.

Rivera continued to maintain his innocence and despite being found guilty of the crime three times and spending nearly 20 years in prison he finally had his conviction overturned in 2012.

One of the critical factors in his successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in Staker’s body, reports the Chicago Tribune.

Juan Rivera was released from prison in 2012 on the basis of the DNA evidence, while lawyers for Marvin Tyrone Williford have argued that he deserves a retrial based on the new evidence

The two murders occurred eight years apart, but in the same area of Illinois

Since his release, Rivera has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against authorities involved in his case.

Cops have now linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000.

Lawyers for Rivera have said that the failure to identify and arrest Staker’s real killer allowed that individual to take part in Foxworth’s murder.

'While Mr. Rivera fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison, the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime,' Steven Art, one of Rivera’s attorneys, told the Chicago Tribune.

Foxworth, then 39, was attacked by three men who invaded his home in January 2000.

When he refused to give them any money, they doused him with gasoline and set him on fire. He later died as a result of the attack.

Police identified three suspects but in the end arrested only Marvin Tyrone Williford, now 43.

He was convicted in 2004 largely on the strength of an eyewitness identification and was sentenced to 80 years in prison.

Williford never confessed, and no physical evidence linked him to the crime. He has always maintained his innocence.

According to his attorney, David Owens, the DNA match to Staker’s killer adds strength to his client's innocence claim.

At a hearing on Tuesday, Owens argued that Williford deserves a new trial based on the new evidence. The judge has scheduled another hearing for next week.

Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown.

Authorities have entered the genetic profile into DNA databanks but have not obtained a match with a known suspect.
