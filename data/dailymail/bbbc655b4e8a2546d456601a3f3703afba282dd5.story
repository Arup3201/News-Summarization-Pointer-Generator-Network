For 9-1-1 dispatchers, keeping your cool in chaotic situations is part of the job description. But a dispatcher in California took keeping her cool to a whole other level when she received an emergency call earlier this year that hit close to home.

Britney Melchor received a call on May 27, about a baby who was choking. When the caller provided the address, Melchor quickly realized that it wasn't just any baby who was choking, it was her baby.

The caller, she quickly learned, was her fiance, Robert Kimball, the father of the couple's 14-month-old son, Maverick.

'Mommy-mode': Britney Melchor says she slipped into 'mommy-mode' briefly before realizing that she needed to remain calm to help her son

Culprit: Melchor's 14-month-old son, Maverick, was choking on a metal washer he must have found while playing in his room

'I heard him say an address and I perked up and then I heard him say it 
again and I recognized that as my own home address,' she tells WSBTV.

Once it became clear that the person in need of assistance was her own child, Melchor says she only briefly panicked before doing what she is trained to do: remain calm.

'Mommy mode kind of hit - like, "That's my son,'" she told KCRA. 'I 
panicked. But then I was like, "You know what? I got to get him to the 
help he absolutely needs.'"

Happy family: With Melchor's help, her fiance, Robert Kimball, managed to dislodge the washer from the baby's airway

Kimball says he was moving furniture around in the family's living room as his young son was playing in his bedroom.

When he went to check on Maverick, he realized something was wrong.

'I tried to see what's going on and I realize he was choking,' Kimball 
told KCRA. 'When I first found him, his face was kind of like a 
pink-red. As it progressed and he started having more trouble breathing,
 it got to a bright red and then he just went pale in face.'

Maverick, it turned out, was choking on a metal washer - and Kimball was frantically trying to dislodge it from the child's airway as Melchor listened in agony.

Cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce: Melchor knew that she needed to remain calm or her son could die

After a few terrifying moments, Kimball, a former orderly at a hospital, managed to dislodge the washer and his son began to breathe.

'I’m very protective of him,' Kimball said. 'And it definitely hit me – knowing that it happened as I was watching him.'

Luckily, mom was just a phone call away.
