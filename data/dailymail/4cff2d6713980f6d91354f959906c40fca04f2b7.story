'Taxpayers deserve better': Public sector workers have received pay rises since the general election, despite a pledge by George Osborne (pictured) to freeze Whitehall pay

Hundreds of thousands of public sector workers have received pay rises since the general election, despite George Osborne’s pledge to freeze Whitehall pay.

Six government departments, the NHS, the Armed Forces and the police were unable to halt pay rises due to contractual obligations to staff.

Many were guaranteed annual increases if they passed an annual appraisal; for example, someone in a salary window of between £23,000 and £27,000 could move towards the top end, but could not progress to a higher pay grade.

Staff at the Home Office, the  Ministry of Justice and the Transport, International Development, Business and Local Government departments enjoyed pay rises – although those at 15 other departments, including the Treasury, did not.

Staff earning less than £21,000 were exempt from the freeze.

Staff at the Home Office, the Department for Transport, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Business and the Department for Communities and Local Government enjoyed pay rises.

However, at 15 Whitehall departments including the Treasury, HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions imposed an absolute freeze, except on those earning less than £21,000.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said public bodies were finding ‘crafty ways’ to get round the pay freeze imposed to repair public finances after 10 years of ‘unsustainable’ spending increases.

‘It’s high time that these bodies accept the severity of the fiscal crisis and stop awarding increases when they shouldn’t, as taxpayers deserve better value.’

A spokesman for the public sector union Unison said the increases reflected staff training and rewarded workers who had reached certain skills levels.

‘The vast majority of staff have been very hard-hit by the government pay freeze,’ he said. ‘The increments do not go up indefinitely.’

A spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘Most of these will receive salary progression, except for when they have already reached the top of their band.

‘Progression pay applied in limited circumstances and will only be paid during the pay freeze where there is a legal requirement to do so.’
