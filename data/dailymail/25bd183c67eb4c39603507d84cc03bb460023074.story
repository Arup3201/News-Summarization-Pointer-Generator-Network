Zara Phillips today launched the latest collection of equestrian clothing by British brand Musto - and was given a helping hand by England and Black Rams rugby star James Haskell.

The rugby player dwarfed the 31-year-old Queen's granddaughter as they posed for a photocall at Somerset House on the Strand in London, where both wore items from the spring/summer range of the British brand.

Zara has worked closely with the brand since the partnership was announced in 2009 - indeed, the collection is named ZP176, after the number Zara was given when she first represented her country - and the keen horsewoman has always had a hand in the design process.

The collections are designed in conjunction with the 31-year-old eventing world champion and Olympic silver medallist, who has said in the past that she tries and tests every product before it goes on sale.

'With design, the products were already there,' she has said of her involvement with the brand. 'I just tweaked a few 
things, like put in a longer cut for the riding jackets, so it won’t 
expose the back if you’re riding in the elements.'

Zara says that the Musto collection is not about wearing the latest trends - rather it's about producing top quality clothing that functions flawlessly.

“It’s 
less to do with mainstream fashion and more about practicality and 
engineering something that works in training, but which you wouldn’t be 
embarrassed to be seen in, in public,' she explains.

Prices for the collection, which is on sale now via the Musto website, range from £45 for a polo shirt to £150 for a padded jacket.

Zara, 31, who married rugby player Mike Tindall in a ceremony last year, has been working with Musto for a number of years
