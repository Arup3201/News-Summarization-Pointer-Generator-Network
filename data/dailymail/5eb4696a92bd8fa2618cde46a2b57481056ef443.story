A man has been charged with blackmailing Katie Price after sexually explicit pictures of her and a former lover.

The 35-year-old mother-of-four said she was 'not worried' after the images of her with a former lover were stolen.

Desmond Fraser, 20, from Birkenhead, Liverpool, is set to appear before magistrates in Basingstoke to face a single charge of blackmail.

Ordeal: Katie Price allegedly had intimate pictures of her and a former lover stolen

In a Tweet, the model wrote: 'Somebody has been arrested and charged about blackmailing to use these stolen pictures.'

She added that her husband Kieran Hayler, who she married in the Bahamas in January, was not concerned about the case.

But this morning Katie tweeted: 'For the record im NOT worried about any sex pictures and it's NOT affecting my relationship, I'm sure ...... would be worried. (sic)'

The former glamour model was out of the UK in August as she had to give birth to son Jett Riviera via emergency Caesarean Section in a French hospital after she contracted an infection which could have harmed the baby.

As Jett was born eight weeks prematurely, he had to remain in hospital for after-care for several weeks.

Katie also has 11-year-old son Harvey from her relationship with Dwight Yorke, and son Junior, eight, and daughter Princess Tiaamii, six, with her ex-husband Peter Andre.

Fraser will appear before the court on October 1.
