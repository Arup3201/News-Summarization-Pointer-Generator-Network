A toddler vacationing with his family in San Francisco was tragically killed on Friday when a 6-foot-tall dolphin statue fell on him outside a Fisherman's Wharf store.

The killed 2-year-old has been identified as Kayson Shleton of Draper, Utah who was in town with five of his vacationing relatives.

Police say Kayson ran up to the illegally placed dolphin statue outside Majestic Collection Art Gallery around 11:30am, stepped on the base and wrapped his arms around the statue before it toppled over and crushed him.

The boy's six-year-old sister tried to protect her brother and stop the statue from falling, but the object was too heavy. It's not known how much the statue weighed.

Freak accident: Kayson Shelton, 2, of Draper, Utah, died on Friday after a dolphin statue placed outside of a store in San Francisco fell on him

'He wanted to go up and touch it,' Kayson's father Scott Shelton told NBC Bay Area in a telephone interview Monday, 'and he stepped with a foot on the base of it and the statue came down on top of him.'

'I think any 2-year-old would go towards anything like that,' Mr Shelton added.

Apparently the dolphin statue was so heavy that Shelton needed help to lift it off his son.

'He had a bloody nose at first, which stopped,' he said to Deseret News, 'and we thought he was going to be OK.'

Moments later the boy passed out and was rushed to hospital where doctors were unable to save him.

Kayson's uncle Sam Delahunty called the toddler's death 'a tragedy.'

'This is something that the family is reeling over,' Delahunty said to the Deseret News.

Scott Shelton said that the sculpture was irresistible to his son.

'I think any 2-year-old would go toward anything like that,' he told NBC Bay Area.

However, Delahunty said that the boys parents are not the type of people to 'point the finger'.

Kayson was initially treated for just a bloody nose at the scene, but authorities say his condition worsened and he was taken to San Francisco General Hospital's emergency room where he died from serious internal injuries a few hours later.

Tragic: Two dolphin statues can be seen outside the store on Google Streetview, though its uncertain whether either object was involved in Friday's incident. According to city code, no merchandise is allowed outside the Fisherman's Whaf store

Warned: Two-year-old Kayson Shelton was killed last week after a 6-foot-tall dolphin statue fell on him in the popular San Francisco tourist spot Fisherman's Wharf

Police spokesman Gordon Shyy called 
Kayson's death 'an unfortunate and tragic incident,' especially 
considering the dolphin statue shouldn't have been placed outside the 
store to begin with.

City code dictates that store objects or merchandise can't be placed on the sidewalk where it impedes pedestrian traffic.

On
 Jefferson Street, where the gallery has it's storefront, there's even a
 blue line that dictates where those objects can be placed.

But
 in the case of Majestic Collection, that line goes all the way up to 
their storefront, meaning it's against code to place anything outside 
their business.

And this isn't the first time that the store has gotten in trouble for their displays.

Shyy says the store was advised on the city code last year, during the America's Cup -  a sailing race in San Francisco Bay.

Another source with the Port of San Francisco anonymously told the San Francisco Gate that Majestic Collection was one of a few storekeepers that do not always comply with city code.

'For a couple of years now the merchants have been warned,' Capt David Lazar of Central Station added to the Gate. 'It is a violation of municipal police code.'

Heartbroken family: Kayson and his mother Toni Shelton can be seen in this family photo posted to Facebook. The Sheltons have since returned home to Utah. A family friend has set up a fundraising page to help raise money to cover funeral costs

Storekeepers in Fisherman's Wharf were also recently sent a letter by the neighborhood merchants' association reminding them of the city code to keep displays behind the blue line.

Dangerous: Kayson's father Scott Shelton, a podiatrist (pictured), told a local news station that 'any 2-year-old would go towards' the statue

The Special Victims Unit will be reviewing surveillance footage to see how the incident played out, McFadden said.

The Sheltons were visiting San Francisco with relatives and were staying at a hotel near where the incident occurred.

They have since returned to Utah. A YouCaring fundraising page has been set up to help parents Scott and Toni Shelton cover the young boy's funeral costs. As of Monday evening, it had raised nearly $17,780, which is more than its $15,000 goal.

'Our hearts have all been saddened to hear of the passing of Kayson Shelton,' fund organizer Brittny Hansen wrote on the page. 'His bright, enthusiastic way of embracing life was a light to all those who had the privilege of knowing him. 

'The last words he said in this life were "I love you", and we sure love him as well.  He will be greatly missed but we are so grateful for the knowledge that families are eternal and that we will see him again.'
