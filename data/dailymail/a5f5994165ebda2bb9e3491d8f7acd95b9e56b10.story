If you want to leave your mark on space, then here is your chance.

Nasa is inviting people to have their names etched into a microchip aboard a spacecraft heading to asteroid Bennu in 2016.

The ‘Messages to Bennu!’ microchip will travel to the asteroid aboard the agency's Origins-Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft.

The robotic mission will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid.

The spacecraft will collect a sample of Bennu's surface and return it to Earth in a sample return capsule.

One microchip will be brought back to Earth. Another copy will remain in outer space long after the sample has landed.

Those wishing to participate in ‘Messages to Bennu!’ can submit their names here by September 30.

OSIRIS-REx will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid, named Bennu. It plans to return an asteroid sample to Earth to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life

The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security and Regolith Explorer) mission aims to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system.

The probe will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid, named Bennu. It plans to return an asteroid sample to Earth to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life.

Scientists also hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals.

The spacecraft, scheduled for launch in September 2016, will arrive at the asteroid Bennu in October 2018. It will travel 406,618,624 miles (654,389,243 km) to reach the asteroid.

After a person submits their name, they will be able to download and print a certificate documenting their participation in the OSIRIS-REx mission.

The OSIRIS-REx mission goal is to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system, the source of organic materials and water that made life possible on Earth.

It also hopes to better predict the orbits of asteroids that represent collision threats to the Earth. It will collect a minimum of two ounces (60g) of surface material.

Scientists claim the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals.

Nasa scientists believe the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron and platinum - could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural resources.

Once the sample return capsule deploys, the spacecraft will be placed into a long-term solar orbit around the sun, along with the microchip and every name on it.

‘It is exciting to consider the possibility that some of the people who register to send their names to Bennu could one day be a part of the team that analyses the samples from the asteroid 10 years from now,’ said Jason Dworkin, mission project scientist at Nasa.
