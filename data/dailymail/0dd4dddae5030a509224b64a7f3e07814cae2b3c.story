A headmaster convicted of sexually abusing his student may lose his court appeal after she filmed them having sex using a spy pen.

The now 23-year-old woman was only 14 when she began a sexual relationship with her headmaster, 51, at a school in Bodø, Norway.

The pair had a sexual relationship for five years and when he threatened to end it, she decided to gather evidence using a camera hidden in a pen.

Caught on tape: The woman filmed them having sex in the headmaster's flat using a pen with a hidden camera

The 51-year-old man was convicted to three-and-a-half years in prison in May this year, but appealed against his sentence.

The clips, which were filmed in 2009 and allegedly show sexual encounters between then 19-year-old woman and the headmaster, were brought forward as evidence during yesterday’s proceedings in Hålogaland Court of Appeal, Tromsø.

The relationship began in September 2004, when the woman was 14 years old, Norwegian newspaper Avisa Nordland reports.

Coming from a troubled home and bullied at school, the 23-year-old says she turned to the only adult she felt she could rely on.

She told the court during the May proceedings she agreed to sex a month later because she was scared of losing him.

Underage abuse: The relationship began in 2004 when the woman was a 14-year-old student at the headmaster's school in Bodø, Norway

She said: ‘I wasn’t ready. I didn’t want sex; I just wanted someone, an adult, to relate to. I may have fallen in love with my headmaster and teacher. He was a caregiver to me. I was so scared of losing him.‘

Student and headmaster would meet in school, in his office or places where they would be left alone, she said.

They would have sex three times a week, and he made her text him every three hours.

She first fell pregnant in 2006 and then second time in 2009, but terminated both pregnancies.

By the time of her second pregnancy, both headmaster and student had left the school, but the relationship continued.

She was given a key to his apartment, which is where the two sexual encounters were filmed.

Convinced he was ‘looking for a new woman’ , she 
had bought the spy pen to gather proof of what had been going on.

New evidence: The films were shown at Hålogaland Court of Appeal, Tromsø, where the headmaster is trying to get his three-and-a-half-year conviction overturned

The headmaster admits that the two videos were filmed in his flat and that he is the man caught on tape in one of the videos.

The clip shows the 51-year-old massaging the woman’s naked upper body.

‘It is the only time anything happened which can be seen as sexual contact’, he said.

He denies being the man in the other clip which shows the young woman having sex with a person only visible from the back.

‘It is my flat, yes. But it isn’t me being filmed with her. I don’t know who it is, apart from the fact that I know it's not me. The girl has a key to my flat. She still does.’

The police have found the man’s DNA in the woman’s underwear, to which the headmaster responded: ‘It is amazing how far some people will go to fake evidence.

'She is detailed so she can reinforce her story. She is good at talking and easy to pity.'

The accused admits he went travelling around the country and abroad with his former student visiting, London, New York and Sweden.

The trial continues.
