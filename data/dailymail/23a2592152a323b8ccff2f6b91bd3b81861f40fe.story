An Iowa airman killed in battle during World War Two has finally been laid to rest in his hometown of Badger - nearly 70 years after he was shot down near the Belgium-Germany border.

Staff Sergeant Maurice Fevold was just 21 when  his plane was hit during the Battle of the Bulge,  the last major Nazi offensive against the Allies.

The plane's wreckage was not found until 2007, and it was only through recent DNA testing that Sgt Fevold's remains were identified, after being recovered in 2012.

More than four miles of flags lined the street leading to Blossom Hill Cemetery for the soldier's funeral

This week a funeral was held for Sgt Fevold and he was given full military honors from the Iowa National Guard, the Fort Dodge Messenger reported.

More than four miles of flags lined both sides of the street leading to Blossom Hill Cemetery for the soldier's funeral procession.

The Badger Fire Department also parked fire trucks along the route, and the Iowa Air National Guard provided a KC-135 plane that flew over the service.

The Battle of the Bulge was the largest - and bloodiest - battle fought by Americans in World War II

Major Mike Willer said Sgt Fevold sacrificed his life to help others and deserved to be honored no matter how long it has been since he died. He said that even if you did not know him it is important to pay him respect 

Major Mike Willer, the chaplain who gave the eulogy at the Bruce Funeral Home in Fort Dodge, said Sgt Fevold sacrificed his life to help others and deserved to be honored no matter how long it has been since he died.

'Even if you did not know him, we pay you respect as we pay him respect,' Major Willer said during his speech. 'That's what soldiers do.'

The Battle of the Bulge was the largest - and bloodiest - battle fought by Americans in World War II. 

It involved  six weeks of vicious fighting in the heavily forested Ardennes Mountains of Belgium.

Some 600,000 US troops were involved  and American casualties amounted to around 81,000. 

The cost to the German Army was 100,000 men killed, wounded or captured and 800 tanks destroyed.

The extreme cold was a major problem - more than 15,000 Allied troops alone were treated for frostbite and other cold-related injuries.

Allies secured victory on January 25, 1945, putting the the final triumph over Nazi Germany  in reach. 

Less than five months after the Battle of the Bulge ended, on May 7 the war in Europe was over.

Bill Bushman said he is the oldest living relative of Sgt Fevold, who was his mother's uncle. He said he has heard little about his great-uncle, but was honored to be involved in the funeral service.

Mr Bushman's mother and Mr Fevold's sister are also buried in at the cemetery.

'This is the best place for him,' Mr Bushman said.

On Monday, flags flown at half-mast to honor Sgt Fevold, on the request of Iowa Governor Branstad. 

Speaking to Radio Iowa, National Guard spokesman Colonel Greg Hapgood explained that the B-26 Marauder on which Sgt Fevold was an armorer and gunner went missing  in December of 1944.

He added:  'A few years ago, someone found in the forest near Allmuthen, Belgium, the remains of an aircraft, and upon further investigation by the United States government and some private groups, some (human) remains were discovered, and they have just recently been identified.'

According to reports Sgt Fevold and five other crew members were on the bomber that took off from Saint Quentin, France, to attack an enemy-held railroad bridge in Eller, Germany. 

It is thought that their plane was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire near Seffern, which sits close to Germany's border with Belgium. All five crew members were officially declared deceased on December 23, 1944, Radio Iowa reports.

The bomber was just one of a total of ten U.S. aircraft were recorded as lost in the vicinity of Seffern during the Battle of the Bulge.

Colonel Hapgood said: 'Sergeant Fevold was highly-decorated for his service as a crewmember on bombers during World War Two. He entered the service in 1943 and served until he went missing in December of 1944.'

Among the soldier's numerous military decorations are the Purple Heart, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, and Enlisted Aircrew Member Wings.

'Since 2006 the Iowa National Guard has the incredible privilege to participate in eight repatriations. Both from the World War Two era and also from the Korean War, ' Colonel Hapgood added.

'It's amazing the lengths our government goes to to recover these warriors and bring them home. And it's very, very fitting to bring him home and welcome him and give him the honor he so greatly deserves.'
