The married socialite expecting Simon Cowell’s baby was accused of being a ‘gold digger’ on Thursday.

Lauren Silverman has allegedly issued the X Factor boss with a string of outrageous demands, telling him she wants marriage and her own reality TV show before she will allow him access to the child.

And in divorce papers filed two weeks ago by her estranged spouse Andrew Silverman, Lauren was accused of being 'cruel and inhuman' towards her husband.

Despite the controversy surrounding her, Lauren looked in good spirits and smiled for the cameras as she made her first public appearance since news of the unplanned pregnancy broke on Wednesday morning.

Carrying on as per usual: Lauren Silverman was seen visiting a shop near her home in New York on Thursday amid reports of 'gold digging' behaviour

In an official statement later that day, Lauren said: 'I am committed to sorting things out with Andrew as amicably as possible to ensure the well-being of our son. I would hope for some space and privacy in order to work through this.'

Her lawyers, Robert Cohen and Bernard Clair of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Thorpe LLP, added: 'We are working to resolve this situation in a fair and reasonable way that protects the best interests of our client and her son.'

MailOnline can reveal that Lauren and her estranged husband Andrew worked together to co-ordinate their statements, each emphasising that their seven-year-old son Adam was their joint priority.

Mr Silverman's stated: 'My top priority is protecting my seven 
year old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my 
wife.  Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during 
this process.'

However, Mr Silverman's brother, 
Alexander, said what had unfolded in the last few days was ‘an 
unbelievable story of betrayal. It is a sad story and a tragic story’.

Mrs Silverman, 36, had been holed up 
with her mother Carole and son at the £2.5million 
family home in the Hamptons, New York.

Mrs Silverman, who is said to be 
ten weeks pregnant, emerged to walk her son to his school bus wearing a white linen blouse which seemed to 
hint at a slight bump underneath.

She later stepped out in a black clinging linen dress.

Meanwhile Cowell, 53, faced the press for the first time since the news broke at a television studio 2,500 miles away in Los Angeles.

He
 refused to answer questions about the baby at an ill-timed X Factor 
press conference, instead calling the matter 'private' 
and insisting the matter was 'sensitive'.

It has emerged 
that Mr Silverman has cited Cowell in divorce 
papers.

The move, clearly designed to embarrass Cowell, could potentially force him to reveal details of the alleged affair in court.

And a friend claimed that the 
Silvermans were far from being an ‘estranged couple’, as has been 
suggested.

Still smiling: Cowell looked in good spirits despite the controversy surrounding his personal life

It is claimed Mr Silverman, a real-estate developer and 
millionaire casino owner, recently upgraded his wife’s engagement ring 
with a ten-carat diamond.

Yesterday Mrs Silverman was accused 
of issuing Cowell with a string of demands – but the claims made against
 her are alleged to have come from Cowell’s supporters, so could be 
designed to win favour for the multi-millionaire.

A source claimed: ‘Lauren is now 
going around telling people that she will be in charge of all his 
[Cowell’s] properties around the world and has demanded a country home 
in the Cotswolds.

She has also threatened not to allow him access to the child unless he marries her.

‘Lauren has also started to push Simon to turn her into a reality TV 
star. She wants her own show like the Kardashians and has already 
apparently started filming the pregnancy.

'Simon is horrified and has 
said no. He [Cowell] is already talking about creating separate baby 
wings in all his homes for Lauren and the baby.

‘His mansions are huge and he will effectively be allowed to carry on with his own life without disruption.

‘He has no problems looking after his
 heir apparent – that is all he is interested in and he will ensure  
Lauren has a roof over her head in order to raise his child.’

Happy: Lauren looked completely carefree and showed a hint of bump in her white shirt as she left the home where she is spending time over the summer with her son

Shy: Andrew Silverman kept his head down after a source closed to Cowell told MailOnline that Andrew named him in the divorce ‘to cause the utmost embarrassment’ to the star

Others around Cowell, who is believed to be worth £225million, claimed a wedding was not on the cards.

One said: ‘Simon does NOT, NOT, NOT 
plan to get married to her [Lauren]. Simon is gearing up for a 
potentially ugly child support battle.

‘He tried desperately to reach an agreement with Lauren before it went public but she surprised Simon and leaked the news.

‘Simon was hoping to reach a 
financial agreement with her and then release a joint statement but 
Lauren is savvy and wants to be famous and when he refused her opening 
demands for marriage she leaked it.’

Cowell and Miss Silverman are said to
 have first met on holiday in Barbados around seven years ago, and 
struck up a relationship around 12 months ago.

Even the music mogul’s closest friends were unaware that they were seeing one another.
Cowell could be hauled in front of a US court to give evidence about his
 affair with his former friend’s wife after being listed on court papers
 as co-respondent.

Lauren posted a picture of the pair of them together to her Instagram page cuddled up together during a holiday.

Along with the picture she wrote: ''Me and my lil Simey monster #simoncowell x'

Mr Silverman, 37, is understood to have learned his wife was expecting 
Cowell’s baby only last month. He filed the papers at Manhattan’s 
Supreme Court on July 15.

New York is a no-fault divorce state, meaning that couples do not need a reason to end their marriage.

But Mr Silverman is said to feel so betrayed by his wife and his 
long-term friend that he has filed for a divorce on the grounds of 
adultery in an attempt to shame the pair in public.

This is heavily discouraged by  lawyers because of the huge costs and the often bitter fallout it causes between couples.

Demands: Lauren has reportedly asked Simon, pictured leaving an LA studio on Wednesday, for her own TV show

Under US law, Mr Silverman is required to prove his wife’s infidelity, 
even if she and Cowell admit to the affair. It means Cowell would have 
to reveal evidence of his meetings with Mrs Silverman, such as hotel 
receipts and text messages.

He would also have to take a paternity test to show whether or not the 
baby was his. If adultery is proved, he will be asked to foot Mr 
Silverman’s legal bills, which could come to more than £200,000.

A source close to Cowell told the Daily Mail last night: ‘This has all 
turned into a mess for him. This is not the way in which he wanted it to
 come out. He is now worried about the sponsorship deals he has for his 
various shows.

‘Companies like Pepsi are not going to be pleased with the headlines about Cowell fathering a child with a married woman.

‘His sponsors could argue that he has brought their brands into disrepute.

‘Many aren’t particularly happy about being associated with his shows as
 they are struggling with ratings and they could now use this as an 
excuse to break out of their contracts. Simon is now worried he may lose
 valuable sources of income.’

Representatives for Cowell refused to comment last night.
