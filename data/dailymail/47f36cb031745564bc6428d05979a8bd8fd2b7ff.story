Residents in a New York apartment building have grown accustomed to the heavenly voice that regularly fills the stairwell in their apartment building.

The rest of the world, however, was astounded when a YouTube video of janitor John Maldonado surfaced and his stunning vocal stylings carried off Mariah Carey, John Legend and Whitney Houston ballads with ease.

Maldonado has been cleaning floors and taking out the trash in the Lenox Avenue, Harlem apartment building for nearly a decade, using the cavernous echoing hall ways and basement as a makeshift practice room.

Studio time: Maldonado hones his singing as he cleans the apartment building

He says he wants to be a singer but when he was younger he was shy and didn't chase his dream.

'When I was younger I used to sing for my family for get-togethers,' Maldonado told PIX11 News.

'I sing for my friends, but I never really pursued it. Secretly I always wanted to be a singer but I’ve always been nervous.'

Now, Maldonado, who was born in the Bronx and now lives in Brooklyn, is hoping to trade his mop for a microphone.

Somehow, his incredible voice failed to get through the audition process on singing shows like American Idol and the Voice, but Maldonado is still hopeful.

He posts videos of himself singing on his YouTube channel, Mop4aMic, where the response is positive.

Hopeful: Maldonado hopes to one day trade in his mop and become a professional singer

'Unfortunately I can’t afford studio time at the moment,' he told Pix 11. 'In the meantime I use the hallways for the echo and I’ve put some videos up on YouTube and some people have taken notice.'

If his singing career does take off, though, the residents at Lenox Avenue will miss his dulcet tones.

'I hear him singing and I come running out of my apartment and swing that door open and just tell him, "Sing it, baby! Woo!,"' one resident said.

'I thank the Lord! He can sing. The world should hear his voice. That's something that God puts in you to do.'
