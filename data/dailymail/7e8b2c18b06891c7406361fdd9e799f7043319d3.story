The discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb almost a century ago gripped the world.

It took 10 years to record and document the numerous artefacts found buried with the young king, and these items were sent to various museums around the world.

The latest exhibition at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum curates many related sculptures, jewellery and original drawings to give a greater insight into the ancient Egyptian teenage leader.

In 1907, Lord Carnarvon George Herbert 
asked English archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter to supervise 
excavations in the Valley of the Kings.

On
 4 November 1922, Carter's group found steps that led to Tutankhamun's 
tomb.

He spent several months cataloguing the antechamber before opening
 the burial chamber and discovering the sarcophagus in February the 
following year.

He recorded
 these movements in his journal, and this diary is just one of the items
 on display in the Ashmolean’s ‘Discovering Tutankhamun’ exhibit.

Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, and ruled between 1332 BC and 1323 BC.

He was the son of Akhenaten and took to the throne at the age of nine or ten.

When he became king, he married his half-sister, Ankhesenpaaten.

He died at around the age of 18 and the cause of death is unknown.

It is opened on the entry for 26 November 1922, in which carter wrote the word ‘wonderful’ to describe his discovery.

The diary is exhibited among other original items including reading glasses, brushes and a brass microscope.

Carter numbered each of the 5,398 objects from the tomb, describing each item on cards, which are also featured in the display.

These records, which show where individual items were found and describe their condition, were published in a three-volume collection, but Carter died before the catalogue was complete.

Many of the items on display have been taken from the archives of Oxford's Griffith Institute which was given more than 3,000 record cards and 1,800 negatives when Carter died in 1939. Other items are on loan from New York's Metropolitan Museum, including this limestone head of Tutankhamun from 1322 BC

When he became king, he married his half-sister, Ankhesenpaaten.

He died at around the age of 18 and the cause of death is unknown. 

Other exhibits on display include glass plate photographs of chairs and other furniture found during excavations on loan from Metropolitan in New York.

On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris, while wall paintings, pictured, showed the king being embraced by the underworld god. It is believed that if Tutankhamun was shown to be this powerful god it would quash a religious revolution taking place in the 1320s BC

Funerary treasure was found in his tomb, pictured, including an 24.2lb (10kg) solid gold death mask. However, the traditional heart scarab, used to show a body's worthiness for the afterlife, was missing. Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth

They were taken by the photographer Harry Burton.

Another item, on loan from New York, is a limestone head of Tutankhamun believed to date back to around 1322 BC.

A second limestone fragment showing traces of paint reveals an image of Queen Neferitit offering a bouquet to Aten, dated to 1345 BC.

The tomb was found in the Valley of the Kings, a valley in egypt where pharoahs and nobles from the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties (known as the 'New Kingdom') in Ancient Egypt were buried from the 16th to 11th century BC

Additionally, the nose and mouth from a statue of King Akhenaten made of indurated limestone from Tell el-Amarna is on display, believed to have been created in around 1335 BC.

Many of the items on display have been taken from the archives of Oxford’s Griffith Institute which was given more than 3,000 record cards and 1,800 negatives when Carter died in 1939.

The institute used these records to publish nine volumes of Tutankhamun’s Tomb between 1963 and 1990. These records were also the basis for a replica tomb on display in Luxor.

The exhibition runs from 24 July to 2 November.

Carter's diary is exhibited among other original items including reading glasses, brushes and a brass microscope (pictured). Carter numbered each of the 5,398 objects from the tomb, meticulously describing each item on cards, which are also featured in the display
