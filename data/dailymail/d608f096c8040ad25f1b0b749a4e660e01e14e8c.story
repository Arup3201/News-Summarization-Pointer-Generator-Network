A gang of robbers stormed into a wealthy antique collector's home and tied him up for seven hours while they stole hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of medieval weapons and other historical artefacts.

Nine men burst into the luxury country home of the 79-year-old pensioner - who has not been named - during the terrifying raid in the picturesque village of Rushton Spencer, Staffordshire.

Two attackers grabbed the pensioner from behind as he returned to his secluded rural property at 8pm on September 27.

They punched their frail victim in the face before forcing him inside the house and tying him to a chair.

Seven other masked raiders then joined the pair as they ransacked the house for several hours and stole hundreds of antiques worth over Â£100,000.

Their valuable haul included dozens of historical guns, axes, canons and shields, which had been collected from across the globe.

A 17th Century suit of armour, a Cromwellian spear and a centuries-old elephant gun were among those stolen in the daring raid.

Locals yesterday expressed shock at the robbery in the quaint village, which is situated in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Councillor Norma Hawkins said: 'This area has a reasonably low crime rate so I was very shocked to hear about this.

Police have appealed to antiques dealers across the country to be on alert for any of the items being offered for sale

'The property is in a remote area which makes it vulnerable, but is not easy to get to by any means, so they must have been watching it.

'I imagine it must have been a terrifying experience for the owner.'

Another local resident, who didn't want to be named, added: 'Everybody has been really shook up by this, we don't expect it around these parts.
