It was poached from the BBC with much fanfare by Sky, which reportedly bid three times as much for the rights.

But the satellite broadcaster may be regretting its decision to snap up American advertising drama Mad Men.

Viewing figures sank to just 47,000 for the third episode of the fifth series on the Sky Atlantic channel on Tuesday night.

Drop: Viewing figures sank to just 47,000 for the third episode of the fifth series of Mad Men on Sky, down from 355,000 during the premiere of the fourth series when it was shown on BBC4

New dynamic: Jon Hamm as advertising boss Don Draper with his wife, Megan, played by Jessica Pare, in episode two of season five

That’s an alarming drop from the 355,000 viewers who watched the premiere of the fourth series when it was on BBC4.

It is understood that Sky is paying about £250,000 an episode for the glossy 1960s drama. Based on Tuesday’s figures, that amounts to more than £5 per viewer.

While the show, starring Jon Hamm as Don Draper and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway, picks up more viewers from repeated episodes and ‘consolidated’ viewing through video recorders, the ratings have surprised many within the industry.

It has been claimed that Sky’s deal for the rights to Mad Men is worth more than £5million, which is thought to cover two series.

Poor return: John Slattery as Roger Sterling with Draper and Vincent Kartheiser as Pete Campbell in a show which, based on Tuesday's figures, is costing Sky around £5 per viewer

At the time of the new deal being agreed in 2010, it was said that the BBC could not compete with Sky’s 'deep pockets' as the licence-fee funded broadcaster looked to reduce its spend on acquired programmes.

A Sky insider said: ‘Mad Men is the centrepiece of the Atlantic channel. But there has been a huge gap from when it was on the BBC to the new series airing on Sky.

‘Sky do not care about the ratings. If it makes thousands subscribe to Sky or stops thousands unsubscribing, then it is OK.

'But that is a lot of money to pay for Mad Men.’

The series was delayed due to contract negotiations between the show’s creator Matt Weiner and the US network AMC.

Losing ratings: When aired on the BBC, the show, which also stars Elisabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen (left) and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway (right), was watched by 1.5million once the BBC2 repeat was included

Some have suggested that the programme has suffered particularly badly after switching from the BBC to Sky because it appeals to a certain type of viewer who may be reluctant to take out a subscription with Rupert Murdoch’s satellite giant.

Mad Men’s figures compare with the 
opening episode of fantasy action series Game Of Thrones, which got 
522,000 viewers on the same channel.

Despite this, Sky has said Mad Men is rating well.

The fifth series launched last week with two episodes aired consecutively. The first attracted 98,000 viewers but the following installment dropped to 45,000.

According to sources, when the show aired on the BBC it was watched by 1.5million once you include the BBC2 repeat, which aired after it had originally been shown on BBC4.

A Sky spokesman said: ‘In Sky homes Mad Men has never been more popular.

'When you look at those who watched the first episode of Mad Men live, or caught up through Sky+ or on-demand, it was the most watched episode in Sky homes ever, and by some margin.’

‘We’re delighted with the response from Sky customers and will continue to invest in the shows that create more value for our existing customers and give more people a reason to join Sky.’

According to the satellite broadcaster’s figures, in Sky homes, the satellite broadcaster’s ratings were 35 per cent higher than the highest rating for a premiere performance of a Mad Men episode when it was shown on BBC4.

The broadcaster refused to comment on the monetary value of the deal.
