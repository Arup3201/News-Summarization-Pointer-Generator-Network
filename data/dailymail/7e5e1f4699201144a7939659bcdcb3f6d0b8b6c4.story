Almost half of Britain’s new breed of ‘local’ Post Offices are frustrating customers by refusing to accept parcels that weigh more than 6kg.

Their controversial ban breaks the Government’s gold-plated rules – known as the ‘universal service obligation’ – which say Post Offices must deliver parcels of 20kg to 30kg.

It means many customers are forced to travel for miles to find a larger branch – a particular problem for the elderly, or small businessmen who sell goods on eBay and rely on their local service.

The local Post Offices are mostly based in newsagents such as the one pictured

The new ‘Post Office Local’ branches are mostly based in newsagents and corner shops.

They offer the most common services, such as posting a letter, paying a bill or picking up a pension, and boast longer opening hours.

Around 2,000 of the country’s crumbling network of 11,500 Post Offices are being turned into ‘Locals’ over the next four years.

But a snapshot shopping exercise by Consumer Focus found one in two operators refused to accept large packages.

The report, given exclusively to the Daily Mail, revealed many customers were given poor excuses, including ‘the weighing scales in the branch not being large enough’.

The report added: ‘Others said they could only accept the parcel if “it was able to fit into the postman’s sack”.’

One customer was told ‘no, take it off’ when they placed a parcel on the scale – because they could have damaged it.

Short-term: When 'Locals' were introduced, bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages, but that was only temporary

When ‘Locals’ were introduced, bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages, but that was only temporary.

The Department for Business, which has responsibility for the Royal Mail, insisted yesterday the weight limit for packages has been ‘up to 30kg’ at Post Office Locals since January.

But the shopping exercise, conducted at 100 Post Office Locals, found 48 per cent of packages weighing more than 6kg – including a parcel of books at 6.5kg and a 7kg saxophone – could not be posted.

Ministers hope Post Office Locals – of which there are currently 134 – represent a new future for the troubled network.
