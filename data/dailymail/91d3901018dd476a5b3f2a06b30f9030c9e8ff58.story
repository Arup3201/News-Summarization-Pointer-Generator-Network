A new video offers a glimpse into Victoria Beckham's recent trip to South Africa, in support of the Born Free foundation - a charity aiming to eradicate the transmission of HIV from mother to child by 2015.

During the trip, which was captured by Annie Leibovitz for Vogue, Mrs Beckham, 40, came to learn about a revolutionary pill for pregnant mothers infected with HIV, which has only been available for a few years.

'The fact that there is a tablet that a woman who is infected with HIV can take, that will mean that that baby will be born free of HIV - that's incredible,' she says in the Vogue video.

Humanitarian: Mrs Beckham (pictured), shot by Annie Leibovitz for the May Issue of Vogue, was personally invited to collaborate by the magazine's editor, Anna Wintour

The fashion designer and mother of four - who was personally invited to collaborate by the magazine's editor, Anna Wintour - looks elegant and understated, dressed in a crisp white shirt and wearing soft, fresh make-up, with her glossy dark hair tied back into a sleek ponytail.

The film also takes viewers behind the scenes of Vogue's photo story, starring statuesque Ethiopian-born model Liya Kebede and shot by legendary Ms Leibovitz.

In the accompanying feature article on VOGUE.com, writer Jonathan Van Meter describes spending time with Mrs Beckham, who tells him it's been a long time since she has found a charity she really feels 'a connection' with.

Touching: The designer and mother-of-four describes her visit to the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape town (pictured) as 'very upsetting' but it also made her realize how 'truly blessed' she is with her own healthy family

Referring to the breakthrough pill, Mrs Beckham says: 'I had no idea that this pill existed, and because of these pills, we are now at a statistic of 97 per cent of babies born free of HIV.

'Obviously I am a woman and I am a mother, and this touched me.'

Just recently, Mrs Beckham shared her photo diary from the 'life-changing' trip, which she described as 'powerful' and 'heart-wrenching'.

Devoted mother: Mrs Beckham (pictured with daughter Harper, two) pointed out that it felt 'appropriate'
that women in fashion, many of whom are mothers, should be lending support to the cause

'The creative community has led the HIV/AIDS response for many years,' she says.

'It seems appropriate, when talking about mother-to-infant transmission, that women in fashion (many of whom are mothers) also lend their support,' before adding that she was 'honored' to contribute.

Mrs Beckham visited several hospitals on her trip, an experience she clearly found difficult. 'Seeing all of the sick children was very upsetting, and I realized how truly blessed I am for the health of my own children,' she says of sons Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight and daughter Harper, two.

The Spice 
Girl turned fashion designer also joined other A-Listers including 
Ivanka Trump and Gisele Bundchen, as well as designer giants Versace, 
Prada and Alexander McQueen, to name a few, to create a range of 
mother-and-daughter dresses for Shopbop, in partnership with Born Free.

The
 relatively affordable collection includes a matching set of 
pink printed dresses with pleated skirts, priced at $220 for the mother 
version and $120 for the adorable daughter dress.

On May 11 the organization will also hold
 a Mother's Day Carnival in partnership with Vogue. The New York City 
event will include performances by Ariana Grande and Idina Menzel, as 
well as friendly baseball games with members of the New York Yankees, 
and family portrait opportunities with a Vogue photographer. Tickets are
 $2,500 for a family of five.

Vogue's May issue, which is covered by actress Emma Stone, hits newsstands nationwide on April 29th.
