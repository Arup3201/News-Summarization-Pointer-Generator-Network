A record number of people used their mobile phones and tablets to shop for Christmas gifts on Cyber Monday yesterday.

More than one third of purchases - 37 per cent – are expected to have been via smartphones or tablets as people browsed at the breakfast table, as they travelled to work, or enjoyed a lunchtime sandwich.

This represents an increase of some 4,000 per cent in terms of market share compared to 2010, according to the web retail trade body, IMRG.

The group said some £25.1billion was spent online during August to October, with £9.3bn spent via smartphones and tablets. And this pattern is predicted to continue through to Christmas.

Total online spending over the weekend, taking in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, is expected to top £1.32billion, according to industry analysts.

IMRG’s Tina Spooner said: ‘Mobile continues to take a larger slice of the UK online retail market. Sales via smartphones and tablets have recorded almost 50per cent year-on-year growth during 2014.’

Adgild Hop (correct), of webtech experts Capgemini, added: ‘We can see just how much influence smartphones and tablets now have on our shopping behaviour. It’s convenient, it’s quicker and with the ability to easily browse between retailers, it can also be cheaper.’

Some 25 million are believed to have logged on to websites in search of festive bargains on Cyber Monday with spending predicted to hit £650million – up 26per cent on the same day last year.

The promise of big price cuts over the weekend, both in the high street and online, triggered a collective frenzy, with some people fighting over flat screen TVs and coffee machines.

While, it is clear that many shoppers were excited by the price cuts, the pressure will now be on retailers to maintain the promotions all the way through to Christmas.

Industry figures measuring shopper numbers show there were more people in the high street on Black Friday, however numbers then fell away.

Experts at Springboard said there were 7.2per cent more people in the high street on Friday compared to last year, however the figure was down by 8.8per cent on Saturday and 0.1per cent on Sunday. By contrast, figures in the big retail parks were up on all three days.

Springboard’s Diane Wehrle (correct) said: ‘With the Christmas season in full flow following the last payday weekend, shoppers were definitely ready to spend this weekend.

‘The sheer scale of the discounts that were available on big ticket electrical items inevitably meant that out of town retail locations where the best offers could be found were favoured as opposed to the high street.’

Retail analyst, Natalie Berg, said stores are creating a rod for their own back with their price cuts.

She said: ‘This is probably going to pull forward spending, and retailers are going to find the first half of December slower too as a result.

‘Once this extended weekend is over, it will be very hard to persuade shoppers to pay full-price for anything, after they have seen the extent to which retailers are prepared to cut prices to get people to spend money.’

Amazon.co.uk held hundreds of limited ‘lightning deals’ which offer discounts for a specific period in an attempt to maintain the hype.

Last year’s Cyber Monday was Amazon UK’s busiest day of sales ever, with more than 4.1 million items ordered at a rate of around 47 per second, with sales peaking at 9.22pm.

Sage Pay, which monitors online payments, said it expected purchases to peak at noon.

Chief executive Simon Black said: ‘With just four weeks until Christmas, Cyber Monday is traditionally the day when consumers rush online to do their festive shopping.’

Retail experts Mintel are predicting a three per cent increase in spending this December compared to a year ago – taking the total to some £36.5billion. Its researchers forecast that nearly 13per cent of all retail sales will involve a mouse rather than a till, with £4.7bn spent online this month.
