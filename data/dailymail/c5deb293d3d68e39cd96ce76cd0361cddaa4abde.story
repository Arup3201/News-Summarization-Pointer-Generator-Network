Ian Carmichael said Anne Hathaway's pixie cut was the worst hairstyle of the year

His most famous client has worn her hair in a barely-changing short style for decades.

But the Queen’s hairdresser is adamant that most women in their mid-40s and beyond are making a big mistake by having their hair cut short in a bid to turn back the clock.

Ian Carmichael, Her Majesty’s personal stylist for the past 15 years, says women of a certain age believe they are too old for tousled tresses.

Yet many celebrities would have lost their sex appeal years ago had they chopped their hair short, he claims.

‘Women in their mid-40s and 50s at one time would rush to cut their hair off. It was like they became wives, mothers, a “certain age” and they cut it all off,’ he said.

‘But actually hundreds of women, as long as their hair is healthy and in good condition, look much better with soft long hair.’

He chose two actresses who are still glamorous at 62 to illustrate his point.

‘Jane Seymour for example is a woman of a certain age who has worked having lovely long hair,’ he said.

‘If she had had it all cut off at the age of 40 she would have lost her sex appeal years ago. Lorraine Chase is another example of this, she has beautiful hair.

‘Big hair, sexy curls are all in at the moment. Women are finally moving away from straight, sleek hair and embracing movement and texture and it is much better.

‘Women are choosing to go for  the Brigitte Bardot sex-kitten look  and I think they are finding it very empowering – being sexy is the new power-dressing.’

Mr Carmichael derided Anne Hathaway’s boyish pixie crop as the worst haircut of the past year. The American actress ditched her long locks for her Oscar-winning role as Fantine in the film musical Les Miserables.

‘It really doesn’t do a lot for her features,’ Mr Carmichael said. ‘Much like Julia Roberts, her mouth is far too big for a short haircut.’

However, he doesn’t mind short styles on most younger women and welcomes the influence of Downton Abbey and the latest film version of The Great Gatsby.

‘The waved bob of the 1920s is really coming back, the flapper look… the bob has become glamorous again, which is really exciting,’ he said.

‘Downton Abbey is so popular and young women are looking at these once old-fashioned looks and are thinking actually that look is cool, that look is sexy.

Five or six years ago everyone was attacking their hair with straightening irons.

Mr Carmichael, 51, is dicreet when it comes to disclosing the secrets behind the Queen's hairstyle. He praised Jane Seymour for keep her lon locks at the age of 62

It is lovely that young girls are embracing the curl.’ Mr Carmichael,  51, who started his hairdressing career in his native Scotland as a  16-year-old trainee, says X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger has the nicest hair he has cut. 

‘It’s all hers and it has never been coloured. Just beautiful to work with.’

But, not surprisingly, he adds: ‘Of all my clients, the Queen is by far my favourite, she has wonderful hair.’

He tends the Queen’s hair twice a week – often travelling the country to places such as the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk to do so.

However, he remains discreet about the monarch, who awarded him a Royal Warrant last year, refusing to gossip.

‘I did her hair on Monday. I have done her hair for a very long time and I remain loyal to her,’ he said.

Mr Carmichael made his comments at the launch of a new range of Sleep-In Rollers, for which he is an ambassador.
