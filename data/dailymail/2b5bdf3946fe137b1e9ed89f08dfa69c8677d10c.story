Reading have moved to pip Blackpool for Spanish left-back Joan Oriol. 

The 27-year-old free agent was due to hold talks at Bloomfield Road but Reading heard of his availability and have stepped in with a better offer. 

Oriol was with Osasuna last season but has also appeared for Villarreal. 

Tug of war: Spanish defender Joan Oriol was wanted by both Reading and Blackpool

Blackpool, however, have signed Donervon Daniels, 20, on loan from West Brom. The defender arrives on a 28-day deal which will allow him to play against Burnley on Saturday. 

Millwall have signed former Fulham defender Matthew Briggs on a one-year deal despite interest from Blackpool. Meanwhile, Fleetwood are signing former Blackpool defender Stephen Crainey.
