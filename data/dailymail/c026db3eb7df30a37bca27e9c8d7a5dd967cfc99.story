This is no child's play - an intricate sculptor has spent hours creating iconic characters of television and film out of crayons

Hoang Tran, from California, USA, left dentistry school to become an artist creating these amazing mini masterpieces.

From a bride and groom carved in miniature detail to the sigils of all the houses from the Game of Thrones TV series, Mr Tran has recreated their likenesses perfectly.

Skill: Hoang Tran (pictured here with some of his crayon creations) painstakingly creates miniature masterpieces from the crayons. The sculptures include well-know film and television characters

Adventure Time: Characters from the popular Cartoon Network cartoon series have been carved in their corresponding colours

The happy couple: A bride and groom are carved in minute detail in the wax crayon. Mr Tran says the colour of a crayon often gives him inspiration for what to carve, the white crayons were used to create a bride and stormtroopers

Use the force: Star Wars characters are intricately carved out of the tiny crayons

Every minute detail of the figures is painstakingly recreated in the children's colouring sticks.

The 28-year-old says he owes all his skill to his dentistry training and tools his still uses every day.

He said: 'I had a lot of experience carving wax, in dental school we had to learn how to carve wax teeth for the fabrication of gold crowns.

'Depending on the difficulty of what I'm trying to carve, it takes me about two to three hours to mostly finish one - a lot shorter than when I first started.

Bender: The angry, alcoholic robot from cartoon series Futurama was carved in the grey crayon by Mr Tran. The 28-year-old spends two to three hours on each creation

Jake the Dog: The canine companion from TV's Adventure Time is carved perfectly - although it doesn't have shape-shifting powers like the Cartoon Network character

Tools of the trade: Mr Tran still uses the dentistry tools he began carving with when pursuing a career as a dentist

'There is some irony that even though
 I left dentistry behind I'm still using my dental instruments today - 
hopefully still creating smiles."

Hoang's
 images have been shared more than 50,000 times on Tumblr and he 
explained he was first inspired by fellow crayon artist, Diem Chau, who 
made carvings of the Chinese zodiac.

Hoang then decided to do his own version of all the family houses shown in the tv series Game of Thrones.

'I thought I could carve a crayon representing the sigil for each of the Great Houses in the show and books.

Game of Thrones: The House Stark sigil, a direwolf, is carved into a white crayon

Sigil: Mr Tran was inspired to create the mini sculptures after watching the TV series Game of Thrones. He created one to represent the Targaryen house - the symbol of which is a three-headed dragon

House Tyrell: The sigil from another of the houses in the Game of Thrones series is recreated by carving a rose into a green crayon

Fish: The symbol for house Tully, a trout, is carved into the Game of Thrones-themed crayon by Mr Tran

Spear and sun: House Martell from the Game of Thrones is carved into an orange crayon. Mr Tran says he still uses his dentistry tools to create the mini masterpieces

The lion: House Lannister is represented by a yellow crayon. Mr Tran's artwork has been shared more than 50,000 times on Tumblr

Game of Thrones: All of the houses in the popular TV series are represented by crayon carvings. 'Since each house also has their own distinctive colour, this seemed to go perfectly with colourful crayons.' Said Mr Tran

'Since each house also has their own distinctive colour, this seemed to go perfectly with colourful crayons.'

From
 there the now full-time artist became addicted to his carvings and went
 on to create other characters from American cult cartoon Adventure 
Time, Futurama and even Star Wars.

He added: 'Sometimes the colour of a crayon is the influence for a creation.

'I had a number of white crayons so I thought of R2D2 and Stormtroopers. I also carved a bride.'

Stormtrooper: The white crayon was also inspiration for a waxy representation of the well-known Star Wars characters

Detail: The bumps and buttons on R2-D2's distinctive barrel-shaped body have been picked out perfectly in the wax

Boba Fett: The iconic character is recognisable in the trademark green colour

C3PO: The metallic Star Wars sidekick is given a waxy makeover in a yellowy crayon

Still creating smiles: Mr Tran says he hopes people enjoy is wax creations
