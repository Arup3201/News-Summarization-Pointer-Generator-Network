Intervention: General Sir David Richards said contingency plans were in place for limited military action in Syria

Hundreds of British troops could be deployed to Syria if the humanitarian crisis worsens, our top soldier said yesterday.

General Sir David Richards  said contingency plans were in place for a ‘very limited’ military response.

His admission is the most serious warning yet that Britain could deploy forces to the warzone, and will fuel fears that the UK risks being slowly sucked into a full-scale conflict.

The Chief of the Defence Staff’s comments come only days after David Cameron announced he would consider military options to remove President Bashar al-Assad.

But General Richards stressed that the international community and political leaders would need to secure support from Syrians before so-called ‘safe zones’ could be protected by foreign forces.

British troops could also play a part in providing food, shelter and medical supplies to refugee camps in neighbouring countries.

Around 40,000 Syrians have been killed since the uprising began in March last year, while hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled across the border. General Richards also said the main focus of any action should be to ensure the crisis did not spill over into other countries.

He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: ‘There is no ultimately military reason why one shouldn’t [intervene] and I know that all these options are quite rightly being examined.

‘But we are some way off. The humanitarian situation this winter I think will deteriorate and that may well provoke calls to intervene in a limited way.

‘We develop contingency plans to look at all these things.

‘It is my job to make sure these options are continually brushed over to make sure we can deliver them and they’re credible.

General Sir David Richards said it is important to contain the crisis so that it doesn't spill over into countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey

‘The main thing we are all focusing on is to contain the crisis so that it doesn’t spill over into countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey. That’s our primary focus but that would also accommodate a humanitarian crisis because we could help deal with that.

‘It is certainly something we have got to look at.’

General Richards’s comments come amid growing signs of frustration in Downing Street at the inability of the international community to halt the fighting.

During the Prime Minister’s visit to the region last week, it emerged that officials were told to examine how Britain could get around an EU arms embargo to funnel weapons directly to opposition fighters.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK had not ruled out military intervention in Syria

No-fly zones imposed by RAF jets and direct Western air strikes have not been ‘ruled out’ and will be discussed when Mr Cameron chairs a meeting of the National Security Council on Syria.

In another BBC interview  yesterday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also revealed the UK had not ruled out military intervention in Syria.

But he stressed that diplomats are focused on overcoming objections from Russia and China to a resolution in the UN.

He said: ‘We don’t rule it out. At the moment we don’t have a legal basis for delivering military assistance to the rebels.

- Israel confirmed yesterday  that it had fired warning shots into Syria after a stray mortar round hit an Israeli Defence Force post.

It is the first time the country has fired on Syrian forces since last year’s uprising began.

A string of mortar shells have struck the Golan Heights, which were seized by Israel in 1967.

The two countries are formally at war and a UN force patrols the buffer zone.

Israel said it views the incidents as accidental but has warned it holds Syria responsible.
