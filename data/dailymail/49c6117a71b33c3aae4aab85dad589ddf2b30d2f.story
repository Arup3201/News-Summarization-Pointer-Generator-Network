Pope Francis has been sneaking out of the Vatican at night to give money to the poor on the streets of Rome, it has today been claimed.

The speculation that the Pontiff has been visiting the poor under the cover of darkness comes after an interview with Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, whose role includes distributing money from the Holy See to the poor.

He said Pope Francis  - who as archbishop of Buenos Aires went out at night to visit the needy - had often expressed a desire to accompany him on his nocturnal missions.

Pope Francis may have been sneaking out of the Vatican at night to give money to the poor on the streets of Rome. Here he is pictured after his weekly Papal audience in St. Peter's Square blessing a severely disfigured man

Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a 
young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers are 
just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted positive headlines in the last 
few months

uCatholic reports that he said: 'When I say to him "I’m going out into the city this evening", there’s the constant risk that he will come with me'

But when asked directly if the Pontiff ever joined him, the Polish archbishop, who is the Vatican Almoner, smiled and avoided the question.

While he simply said: 'Next question please', it
 has been taken by many as an admission of the Holy Father's secret trips out 
into the night to give alms.

The Huffington Post reports that a Vatican source said: 'Swiss guards confirmed that the pope has ventured out at night, dressed as a regular priest, to meet with homeless men and women.'

After years of negative press, the Catholic Church is basking in the 
'Francis Effect' which has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in 
congregations in Britain, and similar boosts around the world.

Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted headlines in the last few months.

As archbishop of Buenos Aires Pope 
Francis was known to often go out at night, to find people, talk with 
them, and sometimes buy them something to eat

This latest claim comes weeks after he was pictured kissing and embracing disfigured worshippers in St Peter's Square, and amid stories he has personally sent money to struggling pensioners and to immigrants.

As archbishop of Buenos Aires Pope Francis was known to often go out at night, to find people, talk with them, and sometimes buy them something to eat.

Past Popes are also rumoured to have left the Vatican at night.

According to legend, Pope John XIII would creep out at  night to enjoy the beauty of Rome, and Pope Pius XII would dress as a Franciscan during World War Two to help smuggle Rome’s Jewish to safety.
