If you are fed up with handling stupid questions at work, then you are far from alone.

When it comes to bizarre requests, the consumer affairs authorities have handled their fair share from demanding members of the Australian public.

They receive over two million queries every year - including everything from vacating haunted houses to compensation for hats that blow off in the wind. Some of the most difficult to answer were:

1. 'Do you have the number for the internet?'

Odd: Australian consumer affairs authorities get some callers who are almost impossible to answer

Less than impressed: One hen party organiser grumbled that the male dancer she booked was 'not better looking' than her own husband

2. My cat died. Can I claim a refund from the supermarket on its unused nappies?'

3. A woman complained that her guests were rude and disruptive and wondered if she was required to provide them with notice to vacate her house. The inquiries officer asked whether there was a tenancy agreement between the parties. It turned out there was not - the guests were her in-laws from England.

4. A woman booked a male erotic dancer for a hen party from photos she had seen online. However the disappointed woman found the dancer who turned up was nothing like the man in the photo. She indignantly said: 'You would expect him to be better looking than your husband, and he certainly wasn't'. The woman was told that she may be eligible for a refund as consumer laws cover services not being 'as described'.

Troublesome family: One woman wanted help to evict some 'rude guests' from her house - who turned out to be her English in-laws

Frightened of her rented house, one tenant wanted to know if she could legally break off her lease if an exorcism were unsuccessful

5. An angry woman called seeking redress for a hat that blew off her head on a windy day, as the hat was not fit for purpose.

6. What do I do with a dead body? What if 
the person is not dead yet? If I discover the body, am I responsible for
the funeral costs?'

7. 'Do I need a council permit to build a tomb in my backyard?'

Overstuffed: One pet owner wanted compensation because her beloved deceased dog had been rendered unrecognisable by an overenthusiastic taxidermist

8. A consumer requested advice after a taxidermist allegedly overstuffed her dog to the extent that the dog no longer resembled her pet when he had been alive.

9. A tenant wanted to break the lease on her rented house, which she believed was haunted. The landlord had agreed if a planned exorcism failed to remedy the haunted house. The inquiries officer advised the tenant to ensure she obtained this agreement in writing.

10. One caller grumbled: 'My builder has moved a rock, modifying the appearance of our property.' When the Fair Trading representative asked how big it was, the caller replied: 'The size of my hand.'
