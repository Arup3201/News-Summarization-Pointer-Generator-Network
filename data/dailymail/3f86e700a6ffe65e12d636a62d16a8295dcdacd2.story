The former star player of a Texas university basketball team has received the devastating news that he will not be able to pursue a career in the NBA.

Baylor University center Isaiah Austin, a former standout at Grace Prep in Arlington, has been forced to end his playing career after being diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder.

Austin was found to have Marfan syndrome, a disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue.

Devastating blow: Isaiah Austin spoke to ESPN after doctors recommended he stop playing basketball immediately when he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome

Baylor coach Scott Drew said Sunday in a news release that the discovery means Austin will not be able to play in the NBA.

The seven-foot-one Austin averaged 12.1 points and 6.9 rebounds this season and announced in April that he would leave Baylor after his sophomore season. The NBA draft is Thursday.

According to the Mayo Clinic, complications from Marfan syndrome can weaken the aorta, the artery that supplies blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

Drew says he hopes Austin will return to school and finish his degree.

Major talent: Austin was projected as a first-round pick in the NBA draft, which is just days away

Obstacles: He overcame becoming blind in one eye to play center at Baylor University and had his sights set on an NBA career

'This is devastating news, but Isaiah 
has the best support system anyone could ask for, and he knows that all 
of Baylor Nation is behind him,' Baylor head coach Scott Drew said.

'His
 health is the most important thing, and while it's extremely sad that 
he won't be able to play in the NBA, our hope is that he'll return to 
Baylor to complete his degree and serve as a coach in our program.'

Austin had already overcome the odds when he became blind in his right eye during middle school, a disability he kept quiet about until earlier this year. 

A clearly emotional Austin spoke to ESPN after his mother drove though the night Thursday from Kansas to Dallas to deliver the news to her son in person.

'They said I wouldn't be able to play basketball anymore,' he said in a shaking voice.

'They found the gene in my blood sample and they told me that my arteries and my heart are enlarged, and that if I overwork myself or push to hard that...my heart could rupture.'

Brave: Still coming to terms with the news, Austin was visibly upset but told his supporters his diagnosis is not the end for him, 'It's only the beginning'

Medical professionals recommended that Austin stop playing immediately.

'The draft is four days away and you know, I had a dream that my name was going to be called. But uh...I'm sorry (inaudible),' Austin broke off, unable to speak.

The brave young athlete managed to pull himself together, and had a message for his fans.

'For all my supporters, I just want to tell them sorry. Sorry they couldn't see me play in the NBA. But it's not the end, you know. It's only the beginning.'
