The Russian firm behind the world's most widely used assault rifle has unveiled a plan for world domination – in fashion.

Siberian arms maker Kalashnikov wants to expand business beyond its AK-47 rifles into a lifestyle brand as recognised and valuable as Apple computers.

And even its most-famous product - arguably the world's most widely used weapon of war - has been caught in the slick corporate makeover and rebranded a 'weapon of peace'.

Three brands: The company sells military, hunting and sport rifles under different names

Shoppers will soon be able to buy Kalashnikov-branded jumpers, trousers and sportswear as the firm struggles with a dip in Russian military spending.

It has also been hit hard by US and EU sanctions that have affected the whole of the Russian defence industry.

Kalashnikov Concern, the new name for the firm, unveiled a new red-and-black ‘CK’ logo yesterday. The firm said: ‘The idea is that weapons should help keep the peace, uphold justice, dignity and the right to life.

‘Weapons make a man courageous, alert and create high sense of responsibility. Weapons protect the weak from the strong.

‘With a weapon in hands, people can ensure a peaceful future for their families, the nation and the country.’

Guns: Kalashnikov director Alexey Krivoruchko said that the company will also produce hunting accessories

The company aims to increase revenue by a factor of four and expand production volumes of all items to 300,000 units per year.

Sergey Chemezov, head of Rostec, the Russian state-owned tech giant that holds a controlling stake in the company, said Kalashnikov will make ‘clothing for shooting sports and hunting’.

Kalashnikov director general Alexey Krivoruchko said that the company will also produce hunting accessories, including knives.

Mr Chemezov told RIA Novosti: 'A brand is a considerable asset for any leading company, although we have a long way to go to Apple’s $100billion brand. I hope Kalashnikov will become as recognised and valuable.'

And Mr Krivorucko was quoted by The Guardian as saying: 'The new brand will reflect our main principles: reliability, responsibility and technological efficiency.'

High tech: Kalashnikov's inexpensive rifles have been used in some of the world's most brutal wars

The firm was started by the late Mikhail Kalashnikov, a former Red Army tank commander during the Second World War.

He drew up the design for the AK-47 rifle while recovering from a wound in hospital after reflecting on problems fellow soldiers had with their antiquated and unreliable rifles that jammed in action.

It is one of the most reliable and widely used rifles in the world with 80 per cent of Kalashnikov’s civilian weapons typically exported.
