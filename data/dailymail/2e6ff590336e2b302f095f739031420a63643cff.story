Koo Stark claims the oil painting was given to her as a gift from her ex-partner

Prince Andrew's former girlfriend Koo Stark has been accused of stealing a £40,000 painting from her former partner.

The US-born actress has 'strenuously denied' the charge, and claimed it was given to her as a gift.

Miss Stark, who famously appeared naked in the film Emily, is accused of taking the oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape by Dutch master Anthonie Van Borssom from the home of her ex-partner American financier Warren Walker.

She was arrested two days later.

Wearing a blue polka dot dress Miss Stark, whose real name is Kathleen, indicated she would be entering a not guilty plea when she answered a summons at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today.

Prosecutor Paul Mitchell told the court Miss Stark arrived at Mr Walker’s Notting Hill home with a bunch of flowers on July 21 and told the housekeeper she was taking two pictures.

As the housekeeper went to get a vase Miss Stark is alleged to have taken a picture off the wall and the pair got in a 'tug-of-war’ over it.

Miss Stark lost when the housekeeper managed to hold on to it but she then ran up the staircase and took another painting before fleeing the property, it was claimed.

Miss Stark’s lawyer Edward Henry told the court his client 'strenuously denied’ the charge.

District Judge Paul Clark declined jurisdiction of the case and bailed the 56-year-old to appear before magistrates again on November 16 so her case can be sent to the crown court for trial.

The photographer was in a relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her ten days before their wedding in 1997.

She also dated Prince Andrew when he returned from the Falklands conflict in 1981, after they met on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy.

He took her on holiday to Mustique, 
she was invited to Balmoral to meet the Royal Family and there were 
rumours of an engagement.

But the romance ended when it emerged she had appeared semi-naked in a raunchy film called Emily in 1976.

In a statement read outside court by Miss
Stark’s solicitor Jules Azzopardi, she branded the charge she faced as 
'bogus’ and told how she had been subjected to a 12-hour ordeal at a 
police station over it.

Stunning Miss Stark denies the claim

Mr Azzopardi said: 'Miss Stark’s innocence and her reputation will be vindicated during these proceedings.

'She faces prosecution for allegedly stealing a painting. It is a bogus charge.

'This was one of several gifts given to her by the chief prosecution witness, given to her before and after the birth of their child.

'You may think that his is the crime, not hers - to claim that this painting, which was given in love to her by him is now claimed to be allegedly stolen by the mother of his child.

'In a 12 hour ordeal following her arrest, detention and interrogation in which she set out her defence, Miss Stark was told by the police that no future action would be taken against her and that this investigation would be discontinued.

'The reinstatement of this investigation and prosecution is regrettable as is the lack of respect towards Miss Stark by her accuser.

'The basis of allegations made against her will be shown for what they are at trial and Miss Stark is confident that the court will acquit her.'

Stark will next appear at West London Magistrates’ Court on November 16 before the case is sent to Crown Court.
