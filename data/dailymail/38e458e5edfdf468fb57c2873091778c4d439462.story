A 17-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after falling out of a moving party bus that was making its way to her high school prom onto a California highway.

The unusual sight of young people in formal wear running across the southbound lanes of the 73 Freeway greeted alarmed Orange County drivers on Saturday at around 7:30pm as friends of Charlotte Boyse rushed to her aid.

The Corona Del Mar High School student was on her way to Mission Viejo with 55 other teens to their prom when a window on the bus suddenly opened and she fell out onto the road.

Prom night in hospital: Charlotte Boyse was lucky to survive a fall from a bus taking her to her high school prom Saturday

The Orange County Register reports that Boyse leaned back against a window for someone to squeeze past her when it popped open.

Two of her friends tried to grab onto Boyse when they realized what was happening, and managed to pull her upright so that she didn't fall on her head, possibly saving her life.

The two girls grabbed Charlotte and 'prevented her from landing on the back of her head, and instead righted her so she landed on her backside,' Conrad Boyse told the Register.

Shockingly, the driver of the bus was oblivious to Boyse's accident and despite pleas from students to stop, continued driving for about a quarter mile.

Freeway fall: Boyse, seen in her hospital bed with friend Payton Gronnerud, crawled to the median and managed to avoid being hit by a car, suffering only cuts and grazes

Multi-lane freeway: Witnesses say Boyse crawling across this stretch of road to the median, and police say it was fortunate she fell early on Saturday night when traffic was light

When he did stop, he wouldn't let students off the bus on the freeway, so several students jumped out of the open window Charlotte Boyse had fallen from and ran to help her.

The students didn't know if Boyse was dead or alive. The girl had 
managed to get herself to the median where she had waited for about 10 
minutes before being able to flag down a couple who called 911.

A driver who was about 20 seconds behind the bus saw a girl crawling across the road toward the center divider and other students running towards her.

'I noticed a girl kind of crawling off the freeway, into the center-divider area, and there were, I think, two boys, at that point, who were just getting to her,' witness Colleen Kreuger told KTLA.

'I was running toward where the girl was, and one of the boys started heading toward me. I asked him what had happened. He said, "My friend fell out of the window of the bus."'

A prom to remember: Boyse was released from hospital Sunday after spending prom night in hospital with some friends who elected to stay with her

Boyse suffered serious cuts and abrasions but initially felt no pain.

'I was in complete shock,' she said. 'My shoe broke off, my phone flew from me.'

She was taken by ambulance to the Children's Hospital of Orange County and released late Sunday.

Several of Boyse's friends skipped prom to spend the night in hospital with her, and Conrad Boyse is eternally grateful to the girls who helped his daughter.

'She would unquestionably be dead without them,' he told the OC Register. 'We are so grateful for the quick thinking and heroic actions of these kids, and for the outpouring of love and support for Charlotte.'

Boyse's parents said the teens were not drinking, and no alcohol was found on the bus.

The bus was rented by about 30 couples attending the prom from a company in Anaheim called Party Bus Limo Rentals.

KCal9 News reports that a spokesperson for the company said the bus had gone through safety checks before picking the teens up for prom.
