Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea are playing on a 'different level' to last season and can win this year's Champions League - but only if the 'sharks in the ocean' let them.

The Blues boss saw his side sweep past Sporting Lisbon 3-1 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night as they finished the group stage undefeated.

And Mourinho thinks his current squad is capable of winning the entire competition, but only if they can get the better of Europe's most talented sides - and avoid the likes of Paris Saint-Germain or Juventus in Monday's last-16 draw.

Speaking to Sky Sports after the victory, he said: 'We can dream about winning (the Champions League) because we did well last year and we are playing on a different level now.

'But let's see if the sharks can let us do that because there are a few sharks in the ocean.'

'The real Champions League starts now. Barcelona are there, Real Madrid, Atletico (Madrid), Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund are there.

'Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, Paris and everybody is there.

'What can we do? I don't know. Last season, we were not one of the top four for sure and we played in the semi-finals. Let's see what we can do this time step by step.'

The match itself was a stroll in the park for the Blues, with Cesc Fabregas slotting home an early penalty before Andre Schurrle netted from the edge of the area.

Jonathan Silva then pulled a goal back for Sporting Lisbon but John Mikel Obi netted his first Champions League goal for Chelsea to seal the victory.

And the Chelsea boss was happy with his side's overall display. 

He continued: 'Immediately I saw our team were very focused and I am so happy for that.

'I feel sorry for Sporting because I would have liked them to qualify but only if Schalke got the result. We are professionals and I am so happy my players delivered.

'It was important to win again. Obviously we didn't need the points but football is not always about what you need. It was a good reaction, good for players who are not playing a lot to have more minutes and I am really happy with the victory.

'We have a good squad. We have players who need to grow up like (Mohamed) Salah, like (Kurt) Zouma - people with many years to play and improve.

'It is good because it is a game without the pressure you usually have in the moment. This was not the game for that. It was quite an easy game to play but they did very well.'

Mourinho also introduced 18-year-old academy product Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the match with seven minutes remaining, to huge acclaim from the Stamford Bridge faithful.

He was also full of praise for the youngster, adding: 'I told him (Loftus-Cheek) that he needs to bring me a bottle of red wine (before he came on) and he said 'No problem, I'll do that'.

'He's a very confident personality. He is not afraid to take responsibility on the pitch. It was an easy game, we were trying to find the best moment to give him an easy chance.

Mourinho was full of praise for the 18-year-old (centre) after the youngster made his debut on Wednesday 

'A month ago he was playing Sporting in the youth but today he was on the big stage and he showed his great potential but he has a lot to improve. He's going to be a big player.'

Schurrle's goal was expertly taken and Mourinho was also quick to insist that the German remains a part of his plans going forward.

'Schurrle is in my plans - when he is in top form,' he said. 'He had a problem when he came back very, very ill after last time he was with the national team but he came on and played well against Newcastle and today he had 75 minutes to improve his form.

'He is a player that needs to adapt better to the Premier League but a one who has goals on his boots.'

And Schurrle himself was also reasonably happy with his own performance - as well as echoing his manager's assertion that Chelsea can win the competition.

Schurrle told Sky Sports: 'It could have been more (than one goal for me). I had a free-kick but I am happy to score a good goal after not such a positive time for me.

'I think I was an okay (performance) for my first start since Maribor but I felt good on the pitch. I am getting better but I am working hard to get my old strength back. I am happy with my goal and my performance and the win.

'We don't fear anybody but we know there are very good and very strong teams in this competition but if we play our best we can win against anyone.'
