Selfie-lovers rejoice: The days of awkwardly sticking your arm out while pulling your best duck face may be over.

A new iPhone case claims to take the effort out of taking selfies by allowing anyone to take a picture of themselves without having to hold their phone.

Named CaseCam, the device has is advertised as a type of a ‘remote-controlled tripod’ for the iPhone with a fold-out mirror that holds up the device.

As well as propping it up, when the phone is laid camera-side down, the same mirror lets the camera see what's in front of the phone.

It allows the user to take both pictures and video, and even includes a timer feature to let the user position their perfect pout.

The Wi-Fi viewfinder feature of the app allows users to see what their CaseCam is seeing on the screen of another iOS device.

This means if someone else has the app installed, users can remotely set up the shot and take the picture from that person's phone.

'The case and app were born out of a desire to be included in group photos of friends and family and to enhance the phone’s capacity for capturing hands-free pictures and videos,' the case's Kickstarter page says.

The picture taken is upside down, as it’s an image of the reflection. The app automatically inverts it to appear the right way up.

CaseCam was created by Seattle-based Garett Ochs, who is currently working on a new design that will allow the mirror to be stowed facing inwards, so that it doesn’t get scratched.

The device is currently only compatible with the iPhone 5 and 5S.

If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, the case will sell for around £25 ($40), but early-bird backers can get their hands on one for £15 ($25).

One of the stand out events of this year's Oscars ceremony was that ubiquitous selfie taken by Bradley Cooper on Ellen DeGeneres’ phone.

The problem that many people highlighted was the fact that Cooper's arms weren’t quite long enough to fit everyone in - but now there’s a solution, dubbed the 'selfie stick.'

A number of companies are now selling 'arm extenders' that not only hold the camera, but are also used to take the shot and even focus the image.

The trend for cameras on sticks, also known as monopods, isn’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including Opteka and XShot.

Monpods work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer, and using the front-facing camera.

Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. Depending on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar.

Others connect remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls.
