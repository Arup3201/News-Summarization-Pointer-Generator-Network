A fitness fanatic has created such realistic paintings of food that they could be mistaken for coming straight off the supermarket shelf.

Tom Martin, 26, from Yorkshire, has created an incredible series of pictures of grocery packaging and labels (some including a same-scale naked woman) which look like photographs.

His renditions of the still life subjects such as nuts, pasta, chocolate bars and desserts, leave viewers speechless when they realise they are not real.

Tom Martin has such a talent with a paintbrush that his amazing pictures of food packaging and labels - with the occasional naked lady thrown in - could appear to be a series of photographs

Mr Martin started to choose his subjects
when he began looking into what makes a healthy diet and focused on 
the ingredients in food.

To create the lifelike compositions, he carefully applies acrylic paint to wood or aluminium, a lengthy 
process that can take an average of two months.

His paintings sell between £5,000 and £25,000.

Anne Marie Sjoholm, manager of the 
Plus One Gallery in Chelsea, west London, that sells the artwork, 
said: 'Tom's paintings look realistic because he strives to represent 
what is real.

Mr Martin uses references such as photographs or modelling to create each piece, but at no point does he try to copy a photograph

The artist said his works need to be seen in person to appreciate the full impact

The images tease the viewer into thinking they are looking at something real, such as a bowl of sweets

'He uses references such as photographs or modelling to create each piece, but at no point does he try to copy a photograph.

'He works mainly with acrylic paint on a panel, which is usually wood or aluminium.

'This gives him a solid surface to 
work against and allows him to use various techniques which he couldn't 
otherwise use on a substrate such as canvas.

'Tom applies paint both by brush and 
airbrush and each painting typically takes around two months, but some 
are less and some are much more, it really depends.

The paintings may look like photos even if the situation - a naked woman breaking through a wall containing a huge set of wrist strengtheners - does not

Tom Martin's just nuts about healthy eating, and it clearly informs his art

'People are typically amazed but the paintings need to be seen in person for the full impact.'

Mr Martin said: 'I've always been painting for as long as I can remember, right throughout school and college.

'I usually work with still life. 
Usually my still life subjects are food or food packaging. I focus on 
food and its content because it plays a very big part in my life at the 
moment

'I am a keen fitness enthusiast and 
along with that comes a healthy diet and the science of learning how 
your body uses carbohydrates and proteins.'

To give a sense of the scale of his masterpieces, Tom is seen standing next to one of them
