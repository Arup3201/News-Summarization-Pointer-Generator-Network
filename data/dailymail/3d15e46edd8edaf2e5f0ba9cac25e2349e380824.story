Former boxer Eugene Maloney has spoken of his shock at learning his brother Frank was now a transexual called Kellie.

Earlier this month the 61-year-old – who guided Lennox Lewis to the world heavyweight title – revealed he is undergoing a sex change and his ex-wife Tracey Maloney told of the breakdown of their 20-year relationship following the revelations.

Eugene has told of the moment he learned through a newspaper article that his older brother had been living a double-life.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was shocked, I began shaking.

'I
 couldn't believe what I was seeing. I went to buy my Sunday newspaper 
and there it was, right in front of me - I saw my brother is now living 
as a woman.'

Eugene,
 58, and Frank had always been very close. They 
shared a passion for boxing and chasing women, and as boys sung together in 
their local, south London, church.

After
 learning of his brother's secret, Frank said he went home and took down photographs 
he had of the pair together.

In a state of shock, he said he cut the pictures up, as looking at them was too hurtful.

Eugene
 said he had no inkling his brother was unhappy as a man, saying: 'There
 was no inkling at all that he ever seemed like he didn't want to be a 
man. It's unbelieveable.'

He
 told how his brother was always a great lover of women. He had married 
twice, always had girlfriends when he was younger, and would fly women 
from around the world to spend time with him.

Frank has two daughters, aged 17 and 13.

Eugene said Frank's revelations have had a knock-on effect on the wider family.

Last week three men confronted him as he waited for a bus, asking if he was 'that perv's brother',before punching him to the ground.

He said their mother, Maureen, was taking the news hard.

'My
 mum was always love her three sons, she will. But she's hurting. I 
don't want to go into exactly what her thoughts are but she is in 
shock.'
