Formula 1 fans lashed out at Lewis Hamilton today after the race ace appeared to dismiss Michael Schumacher's skiing injury, declaring: 'All things happen for a reason'.

Fans took to Twitter to vent their anger at Hamilton, branding the 2008 Formula One World Champion a 'moron' and an 'idiot' for his comments, made during an interview today ahead of this weekend's Melbourne Grand Prix.

Asked about the accident that has left Schumacher fighting for his life in an artificially-induced coma, Hamilton said: 'I feel like all things happen for a 
reason, I think that this is an experience that will really show his 
character and depth and even more so than any other experiences he's 
had.'

Crass remark: Lewis Hamilton has come under fire for saying 'all things happen for a reason' when asked about Michael Schumacher who remains in a coma following a skiing accident 11 weeks ago

'Moron': Fans took to Twitter to vent their anger at Hamilton, branding the 2008 Formula One World Champion a 'moron' and an 'idiot' for his comments, made during an interview today ahead of this weekend's Melbourne Grand Prix

'Idiot of the week': Others were rather simpler in their criticism of Hamilton

Anger: One Twitter user compared the Formula 1 driver's remarks to his technique on the track

Anger: One fan was reduced to swearing in capital letters

Odd: Another user called the remarks 'bizarre' adding: 'The guy lives on another planet! Muppet'

Schumacher fans instantly leapt to their hero's defence, calling out his race-track rival for being insensitive.

'Lewis Hamilton's comments on Schumacher's accident are utterly moronic,' wrote Euan Mason.

Gerard Neal simply wrote, 'Idiot of the week', alongside a link to a news story about Hamilton's comments.

Seven-times
 Formula One world champion Schumacher has been in an artificially 
induced coma for almost 11 weeks since hitting his head on a rock while 
skiing in the French Alps.

Insensitive: Hamilton's seemingly insensitive remark came as he was speaking to press at Melbourne's St Kilda Beach ahead of the Melbourne Grand Prix this weekend

Backlash: Supporters of the British driver will argue that the comment should not be taken out of context and that Hamilton was expressing his confidence that Schumacher will wake up and make a full recovery. But not this one

Yesterday
 his family said he is showing 'small, encouraging signs' and that they 
remain confident he will 'pull through and will wake up'.

Hamilton's seemingly insensitive remark came as he was speaking to press at Melbourne's St Kilda Beach ahead of the Melbourne Grand Prix this weekend.

Supporters of the British driver will argue that the comment should not be taken out of context and that Hamilton was expressing his confidence that Schumacher will wake up and make a full recovery.

Hamilton, 29, said: 'As a young driver who watched Michael through his early days, and championship wins, we - as Formula One - will carry him through the whole of the season.

'I am in touch with his people, so I am fortunate to get first-hand news of what is happening and we are all waiting for him to wake up and show those positive signs.

'He's a legend in the sport, you know, who has achieved so much, a very motivated individual.

'So I feel like all things happen for a reason, I think that this is an experience that will really show his character and depth and even more so than any other experiences he's had.'

Encouraging signs: Former F1 world champion Michael Schumacher, 44, suffered a head injury in a skiing accident 11 weeks ago

Tribute: The Mercedes team ran a message in support of Schumacher throughput  the pre-season tests

Reflective: Lewis Hamilton insists his thoughts will be with Michael Schumacher throughout the F1 campaign

Defence: Some Twitter users defended Hamilton, saying his comments were read out of context

A matter of interpretation: Another Twitter user said the argument among fans was a storm in a teacup

Hamilton's comments are in contrast to the actions of some his fellow racers.

Reigning F1 champion Sebastian Vettel is paying tribute to Schumacher by driving in this weekend's season opener wearing a helmet with the legend's signature just below the visor.

Drivers Felipe Massa and Jules Bianchi have also said they will follow suit by wearing helmets emblazoned with the initials MS.

Schumacher was placed in an induced 
coma after undergoing two operations to remove blood clots from his 
brain in the wake of his skiing accident on December 29.

He remains in a waking-up process at the University of Grenoble hospital in France.

In a statement issued on behalf of the 45-year-old's family, the F1 star's agent said: 'We are, and remain confident, Michael will pull through and will wake up.'

'There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know this is the time to be very patient.

'Michael
 has suffered severe injuries. It is very hard to comprehend for all of 
us that Michael, who had overcome a lot of precarious situations in the 
past, has been hurt so terribly in such a banal situation.

'It
 was clear from the start this will be a long and hard fight for 
Michael, and we are taking this fight on together with the team of 
doctors, whom we fully trust.

'The length of the process is not the important part for us.

Given
 the longevity of his situation, however, that has led to an increasing 
number of reports he will never awaken, or if he does, he will be 
severely limited with regard to his functions and capabilities.

Today's
 positive news follows a report last week that Schumacher's family were 
informed by doctors treating him that the chances of recovery are now so
 slim that only 'a miracle' can save him.

'It is heart-warming to see how much sympathy his family is shown and I can say the family is extremely grateful for it.

'However, it should not be forgotten Michael's family is dealing with an extremely intimate and fragile situation.

'And
 I would like to remind all of us Michael has always actively kept his 
family out of the public eye and consequently protected their private 
lives.
