Doctor Who has been hit by a further online leak with rough footage from the new series starring Peter Capaldi emerging almost six weeks early, it was revealed today.

Series eight of the sci-fi series is not due to be screened until late next month on BBC1 but a black and white version without special effects has found its way on to the internet.

BBC bosses are already investigating how a number of scripts for the show had escaped their clutches ahead of the latest run with Capaldi as The Doctor, replacing Matt Smith.

The corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide reminded fans that it is illegal to obtain and share the footage and were also thanked for their efforts in clamping down on leaks.

It said of the latest leak: ‘This is part of BBC Worldwide's ongoing security investigation into leaked unfinished Doctor Who materials. This content is currently being removed and originates from the same Miami server we disabled last week.

‘We'd like to thank the amazing Doctor Who fans who are continuing to keep fansites and social media spoiler-free but would remind those downloading and sharing this material that it's illegal to do so.’

The new series begins on August 23 but stars and producers are taking the show on a world tour prior to the launch, kicking off in Cardiff, where the programme is made.

The trailer for series eight was shown for the first time last night at half-time during the BBC's broadcast of the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina.

It is believed the scripts for five episodes were leaked after being sent to BBC Worldwide’s office in Miami for translation.

Novelist and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce has written an episode of the new series - which features the voice of Peppa Pig.

The show will include a cast of young actors including Harley Bird, who landed a Bafta for voicing animated character Peppa, as well as Abigail Eames who featured in The Crimson Field, Ashley Foster from the The Woman In Black and Jaydon Harris-Wallace.

Cottrell Boyce, who wrote the opening ceremony for London 2012, has worked on films including 24 Hour Party People, about the Manchester music scene, and the Danny Boyle-directed Millions.
