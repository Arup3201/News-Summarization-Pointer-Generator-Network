A University of Minnesota student has talked of his horror at watching two friends die after they all fell in the Chicago River on Monday night.

Quoc-Viet Phan Hoang, who is recovering in a hospital, says his friend Ken Hoang died in his arms as they waited to be rescued.

The 23-year-old said he watched helplessly as his other friend, Lauren Li, was swept away in the icy river. Her body was finally recovered Wednesday afternoon after a prolonged search.

'I lost two good friends. It's not easy seeing your friends drift away and having one die in your arms. I have never felt so helpless in my life,' Mr Hoang told ABC 7.

Mr Hoang and Miss Li jumped in the river to try to save Ken Hoang, 26, who had dropped his camera phone while taking 
pictures of the ice at about midnight.

A passerby who heard their cries for help called the emergency services, but rescue workers were only able to pull the men, who are cousins, from the river.

The witness, named only as Luis, told WLS: 'My
 friend said he heard a yell [for] help, you know. At first I didn't 
believe it, so we still kept walking this way to keep sightseeing. As we
 got closer, he heard it again and I heard it again, too.'

'I kept saying who was he with? And 
they said he had a friend and girlfriend, too, that went under the 
water, but he couldn't find her. We called the police,' Luis added.

The Cook County medical examiner's office ruled yesterday that Ken Hoang drowned and alcohol contributed to his death, the Chicago Tribune reported.

They confirmed the recovery of Li's body just before 1pm on Wednesday, according to the New York Daily News.

Mr Hoang posted a wrenching Facebook response to the loss of his cousin and friend earlier this week.

'Life's
 too short ... I hope no one would ever have to go through something so 
unfortunate such as what has happened ... from the bottom of my heart I am
 sorry for what happened. RIP Ken Hoang Lauren Li,' he wrote.

Remembered: Friends and family have paid tribute to Lauren Li and Ken Hoang who died on Monday

The Minnesota friends had been on a road trip to New Jersey when they decided to make a brief visit to Chicago.

Miss Li's father had waited anxiously at a hotel in the city for police to find his daughter, who was missing since Monday.

'Itâ€™s even harder on [my wife Louisa]
 than it is on me, I think,' Mr Li said. 'I try to talk it out with my 
wife, try to find some comfort.'

Outpourings
 of grief and support for Li have appeared on friends' Facebook pages 
and Ken Hoang's family has created a memorial fund page at Youcaring.com.
