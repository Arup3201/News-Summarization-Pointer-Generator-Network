In a chilling photograph unearthed last week, the Hitchin Grammar School hockey team look on nonchalantly as they are confronted with the Nazi salute, and three sharp cries of ‘Heil Hitler’. 

Now one of the boys in the image has revealed how they got their own back on their German opponents – by taking photographs on the away leg of their sporting clash that would provide vital intelligence to the Dambusters bombers.

Graham Sainsbury, who was 15 at the time of the ‘friendly’ game in March 1939, has told how the schoolboys travelled to Essen in the Ruhr valley a few weeks later for a return match.

During their trip, they visited the new Baldeneysee dam, taking sightseeing photographs that would provide invaluable information about its design for 617 Squadron’s daring raids on the nearby Mohne and Eder dams four years later.

Mr Sainsbury, now 88, said that he submitted his holiday snaps after the government appealed for any pictures of German infrastructure citizens might have.

‘They asked for any photographs of the dams on the Ruhr and the Rhine,’ he recalled from his home in Weston, Hertfordshire. ‘I had taken pictures from the top of the dam.

‘I gave them everything I had. It allowed our people to look at the way the German dams were constructed. It might have helped the Dambusters.

‘At the time I had no idea that the photographs would mean anything at all. I can’t really recall what the dam looked like, though I seem to remember some big spherical boulders. It was just part of the sightseeing trip.’

Although Baldeneysee was not targeted by Guy Gibson’s bombers, information about the construction of the dams was vital in ensuring Barnes Wallis’s bouncing bombs would avoid defences and strike vulnerable points.

The 1943 raids caused flooding, badly damaging German production, including the Krupp arms factory in Essen.

Mr Sainsbury, who thinks he is the third boy along in the photograph, obscured but wearing glasses, said: ‘It was just a routine hockey match.

‘Beforehand, the dear old master Mr Bowker said, “They are going to line up and they will give you their normal salute. You are not to laugh, grimace or make any other gesture. Just be British and when they have done it, get on with the match.”

There was no hatred. This is what they did, then they played hockey. We did not know then what it meant. We had no idea of the horrors to come.’

Mr Sainsbury said that during  their visit to Germany, they went to  a Hitler Youth meeting. He said: ‘We were entertained by a Hitler Youth group and, typically of British youngsters, we wanted a souvenir. I got a bayonet with a Hitler Youth badge on the handle.’

The picture of the Nazi salute was discovered by former BBC newsreader Richard Whitmore, 77, and an archivist for the Hitchin Historical Society.

Mr Whitmore said: ‘Although I was a pupil at the grammar school from 1943 this was the first time  I had heard of the incident, and I don’t mind admitting that it sent a shiver down my spine.’

Mr Sainsbury later served as an infantryman with the Essex Regiment, seeing action at Arnhem.

After demob, he worked for a bank and a chemical firm and ran the village post office in Willian, Hertfordshire, with his wife Olive, 80, for 26 years until they retired in 1990.

He added: ‘It is a shame but I think all the others in the hockey team have died. I can remember the names of some of them: Lester, Jackson, Waters, and Grant was the goalkeeper.

‘It was so strange to see that photograph after all these years. I was flabbergasted. They were our guests and at that time I don’t think anyone was serious about the Nazis.’
