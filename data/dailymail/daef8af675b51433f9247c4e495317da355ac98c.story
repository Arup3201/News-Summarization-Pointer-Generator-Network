Here’s to health and wellbeing (and gorgeous skin!) with the new year in mind. Liz Earle lifts a glass to the benefits of juicing

The beauty benefits

Liz Earle

I’ve been singing the praises of juicing for 30 years and I’m more excited than ever to share in my new book (see page 66) the many varied health, beauty and wellbeing benefits. To give you an introductory flavour, the recipes on these pages include some of my favourite beauty and skin-boosting juices.

Beauty, like health, comes from within, so what we eat plays a vital role. Good skincare can help us look good on the outside, but nothing will last if it doesn’t also come from within. Sparkling eyes, clear, glowing skin, vim and vigour are all signs of a healthy working system. Raw fruit and vegetable juices aid the body’s natural functions of cleansing and repair to keep us looking young and feeling great.

They are also bursting with vitamins, minerals and other very valuable micronutrients that help build stronger, clearer and more youthful-looking skin. Fruit and vegetables – especially the most colourful kind – are key here. The pigments in fresh produce correlate to the nutritional compounds contained within; for example, the orange colour of carrots, apricots and mangoes means a rich source of carotene, while the red, purply blue tones of cherries, blueberries and red cabbage come from antioxidant-rich anthocyanins. These nutrients are particularly useful when it comes to preserving our collagen and elastin fibres, the springy network of elastic tissues that gives skin its youthful plumped-up glow.

On the subject of juicers, the centrifugal kind fits the bill. These work by means of a rapidly spinning blade and centrifugal force whizzing around a central cavity, forcing pulp one way and juice the other. Most kitchen appliance brands have their own versions (some brands make several different varieties). The main difference tends to be the power of the motor – the more powerful the machine, the faster it will juice.

The more powerful machines may also be slightly better built, as they need a sturdier housing for the motor. They can be a good investment if you’re intending to juice on a daily basis, as, being more robust, they tend to have a longer working life. Much has been written about the benefits of ‘slow juicers’ which – as their name suggests – crush fruit and veg in a slower way, more akin to a cold-pressing action.

 The theory is that this preserves nutritional values by avoiding excess heat in the blades, but research has shown that high-speed juicers are more efficient at extracting the juice (and therefore higher levels of nutrients), so may be a better option. My favourite juicing machine is one with a high-powered motor and wide feeding tube to accommodate whole apples and larger pieces of veg – which also saves time chopping.
