American fans were given permission to skip work to watch their team at the World Cup as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo extended lunch breaks across the state.

Cuomo was responding to an appeal from Jurgen Klinsmann, who posted a sick note for Americans to show their boss on twitter.

The Governor assured Klinsmann that 'The State of New York stands strongly behind Team USA' and that 'New York believes that we will win'.

VIDEO Klinsmann and Low put friendship aside

USA 
coach Klinsmann had sent out the absence note on social media for supporters - with 
understanding bosses - to excuse them for the day, and reminded those 
willing not to forget to 'wear your jersey'.

The
 best excuse for staying at home, Klinsmann believes, is because the 
team 'will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to 
the next round'.

USA lost the final Group G fixture 1-0 to a Thomas Muller strike, but qualified anyway as Portugal failed to beat Ghana by the required four goals.

Team USA tweeted a picture of the team celebrating their qualification after the final whistle with the slogan 'One Nation. One Team'.

Celebration: Team USA's official twitter posted a photo of the squad after they qualified
