In seven years as Monaco boss Arsene Wenger was never once distracted by the lure of its famous casino.

'I spent a lot of time on the football pitches, I don't think anyone saw me in there,' said Wenger, as he arrived at the Stade Louis II on Monday night, aware that on his first competitive return to Monte Carlo he will be expected to gamble.

Arsenal paid the price for taking risks in the first leg and lost 3-1. As a result history is stacked against them. In the Champions League era, no team has overturned a deficit of two or more goals having played at home first.

Delve back into the European Cup and Ajax were the last to manage it, when they needed a play-off to beat Benfica in 1969. Wenger was still playing for Mutzig in the French third division back then, and Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim was not yet born.

'The statistics are against us, we are conscious of that,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie. That's our desire. We believe we can do it and I'm confident we will. If we didn't believe we wouldn't be here. Football is not predictable.

'We totally missed the first leg, which was surprising. We did not play well. Sometimes in life if you miss a chance, you do not have a second chance, but we do, so we will play it fully.'

But he would not commit to a gung-ho charge from the outset. 'Early goals or late goals but we need full power and must not forget the organisation and structure of the team,' he added.

Disturbing stats lay behind the headline stat. Monaco have not lost a European tie at the Stade Louis II for 10 years. And they have not lost one at home by a score which would knock them out since Leeds won 3-0 here, nearly 20 years ago.

Arsenal must score three and hope to keep Jardim's team at bay, something they were unable to do in London.

Wenger has no shortage of creative flair at his disposal and backed France striker Olivier Giroud, who has scored six in seven, to make amends for chances missed at the Emirates Stadium.

It might be easier if Monaco were not so miserly. But this team is built on a stern defence. They have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and did not let in a goal in three home Champions League group games.

Despite all this, Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker echoed the idea that belief in the camp is strong, and has been improved by a team meeting in the aftermath of the first-leg defeat, three weeks ago.

'We have a second leg in this competition, thank God,' said Mertesacker. 'A lot of things went not so well in the first game, especially a few decisions which did not go for us. 

'We know in the first leg we weren't up for it mentally. From the start you could feel that there was a bit of pressure and we couldn't cope.

'We feel like after that game we moved on and improved a lot. That is why we are confident that even away from home, we can beat any team in the world. 

'Obviously we did something wrong to get that result but we can learn. We need a good performance. It is not going to be easy, but we would like to show a different face.'

Monaco turned on the charm on Monday night. Vice-president Vadim Vasilyev met Wenger on his return to Stade Louis II and presented him with a framed collection of photographs to mark his time at the club.

Wenger seemed more concerned about the state of the pitch and went out to inspect, even though his players had trained in England, earlier in the day. He came back with a positive pitch report.

Arsenal's support in the 18,000-capacity stadium is expected to be boosted by their French fan-base, which is another by-product of the Wenger years, and they can cling to one positive statistic: the Londoners have not lost in 10 games in France.

Even then, it might not be enough. 'Paris Saint-Germain knocked out Chelsea and showed the quality of work being done here in France,' Monaco boss Jardim warned. 'Who knows, this might be the year when France beat the English.'
