Brazil’s 
poster boy was his all-action self against Mexico in Fortaleza’s Estadio
 Castelao but the opposition’s dirty tactics minimised his impact as 
Brazil struggled to battle their way past their stubborn fellow group 
leaders.

Neymar couldn't help but show his emotions as his nation's national
 anthem played - Brazil's star man burst into tears as the players 
lined-up before the match and had to wipe his eyes ahead of kick-off.

The
 brilliant number 10 failed to add to his 33 goals in 50 games but time 
and again almost inspired the Selecao to a narrow victory, only to be 
foiled one way or another by Guillermo Ochoa.

Despite being kicked all over the park, Neymar had one of Brazil’s best efforts - when Ochoa brilliantly tipped away his 26th minute header - and created the other by putting the ball on Thiago Silva’s head from a 85th minute freekick.

The newly blond forward also had a volley well saved and looked the most likely to break the deadlock for either side, despite being tripled-marked at times.

His 26th minute header was destined for the corner of the Mexico net before Ochoa brilliantly scooped it out in one of the best tests of FIFA’s new goalline technology.

That moment summed up the 22-year-old’s evening as he showed his undoubted skill but was often thwarted by enthusiastic opponents both within and out of the laws of the game.

In truth, 
Neymar is perhaps fortunate to have come out of the game unscathed given
 the tenacity of the challenges flying in at his ankles.

But
 the lack of a goal to boost him in the Golden Boot stakes will have 
disappointed many punters as well as the Brazilian public.

Ultimately,
 Mexico showed that teams CAN stop Neymar – it just takes some astute 
goalkeeping and some risky challenges. Cameroon might not be so lucky in
 Brazil’s final group game.
