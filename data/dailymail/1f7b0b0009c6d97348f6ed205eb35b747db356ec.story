Quite a reaction: Samantha Brick's tell-all piece about how women hate her has sparked a huge reaction around the world

Her name has dominated the internet for the past two days as millions of people read her controversial article, but now Samantha Brick's internet notoriety has been taken to the next level - she has become an internet spoof sensation.

People felt so strongly about her article yesterday asking 'Why do women hate me for being beautiful?' that they took to social networks to share their views as well as creating humorous photos, videos and blogs.

Samantha has even had several fake Twitter accounts set up pretending to be her, although they have now been suspended.

Her name has trended 
globally on Twitter for the past two days and top tweets include @LouboutinJools who jokingly 
wrote 'Just been to Starbucks, when they asked my name and I told them 
Samantha Brick I was still asked to pay.'

As well as @boobygraffoe who stated 'I’ve heard of “beer-goggles” Samantha Brick would appear to possess a “beer-mirror”.

Hundreds of people have created humorous altered photos of the writer and posted them online with a massive response.

@Eamonn_Forde
 doctored a photo of Samantha and replaced her husband's head with her 
own. He wrote '*That* photo of Samantha Brick and her husband wasn't 
attractive enough. So I fixed it for her.'

Spoof sensation: In just hours Samantha's article yesterday became a worldwide sensation, but now her internet notoriety has been taken to the next level - she has become an internet spoof sensation

Play on words: One of the videos created in response to the article is a talking brick, which puts a twist on the words in her article from a bricks point of view

Another internet user decided to 
recreate Samantha as a Barbie doll.

On a bright pink mock-up of a Barbie
 advert, they called her 'Brick Barbie,' with the tag line 'She's 
tremendously self-centered!'

A montage of Samantha posing on a sofa also surfaced, accompanied by witty tag lines. 

One
 of them included 'Hi I'm Samanatha Brick and windows was my idea... 
that way everyone can see me,' as well as 'Hi I'm Samantha Brick and 
photoshop was invented so you can be as beautiful as me!'

Barbie brick: People felt so strongly about her article yesterday asking 'Why do women hate me for being beautiful?' they felt compelled to create spoof photos

Changing face: One user doctored a photo of Samantha and replaced her husband's head with her own. He wrote '*That* photo of Samantha Brick and her husband wasn't attractive enough. So I fixed it for her'

A montage of Samantha posing on a sofa also surfaced, accompanied by humour tag lines

She has even inspired spoof videos which have attracted thousands of hits in their first day online.

One
 of short videos is a red foam talking brick, which reads out her article, as well 
as 'Samantha Brick make up tips,' along with clips of how men may react to her 
on a daily basis.

Samantha's article 
yesterday became a worldwide internet sensation and her
 fiery response to her critics posted online earlier today, in which she says her 'detractors 
have simply proved my point,' has again provoked a deluge of online 
comments.

Admittedly, not all were supportive with
 many people saying she was 'delusional' and 'against feminism,' while others accused her of being 
deliberately provocative.

Some users however, rode to her defence and said she had a right to freedom of expression and several people said 'at least she is honest about her views.'

The comment on today's article which received the most red arrows - meaning users did not like it- was from Christine in Salt Lake City, U.S. 

She wrote: 'This women has what every women wants !! SELF ESTEEM!!! Every women should be able to look at themselves as the most beautiful women in the world .You go girl!!!!'

The comment which 8,240 users deemed a positive with green arrows was written by Rebs, in Dublin, Ireland. She wrote: 'We don't dislike you for thinking you are beautiful, that's fine. It's your arrogant deluded attitude that is annoying.'

Samantha's original article and her response have been our two most read stories on the MailOnline for the past two days - gaining nearly 8,000 comments on the site between them and still growing.  

Today she stated: 'While I've been shocked and hurt by the global condemnation, I have just this to say: my detractors have simply proved my point. Their level of anger only underlines that no one in this world is more reviled than a pretty woman.'

She adds that she isn't surprised Victoria Beckham has moved to Los Angeles as, as, in Samantha's words: 'She knows better than anyone how your looks can be used against you in Britain — here we reward false modesty instead and gang up against anyone who isn't suitably self-deprecating.'

Sarcastic comment: Reality TV star Sally Bercow took to Twitter to post about Samantha Brick

Internet storm: Samantha, who lives with her French husband Pascal Rubinatin the Dordogne, could have had no idea what a reaction her piece would provoke

This chart shows how the search term 'Samantha Brick' exploded into life on Twitter today

Yesterday the top-rated comment 
following her first piece was from Annie, in Toronto, Canada, who was 
awarded an astonishing 18,000 'green arrows' from fellow readers for 
saying Samantha needs a 'reality check'.

But there's no doubting people found her tell-all interesting - since the confessional piece was published yesterday Samantha's story has racked up more than 1.5million hits on our site.

The story has also been picked up and commented on by dozens more around the world as interest in it spread across the internet.

It has been used on
everything from the The Daily Telegraph and The Independent's websites in the UK to 
ABC News in the U.S. and fashion magazine Stylist.

On Facebook nearly 50,000 shared it with their friends and at one point yesterday the story was the second top trend on Twitter as millions of people talked about it online.

Samantha
 was more discussed than James Murdoch quitting BSkyB, free ice cream 
and all the other big news stories of the day and a spoof Twitter 
account was also set up to poke fun at her.

So what was it that got people so het up?

BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article

Many of the comments alluded to Samantha's claim that women feel threatened by her.

Speaking from her home in the Dordogne, France, Samantha
 told the Mail: 'I'm not smug and I’m no flirt, yet over the years I've 
been dropped by countless friends who felt threatened if I was merely in
 the presence of their other halves.

'If their partners dared to actually
 talk to me, a sudden chill would descend on the room.

The Stylist magazine wrote a piece entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' in defence of the Daily Mail writer

She also said: 'While I’m no Elle 
Macpherson, I'm tall, slim, blonde and, so I'm often told, a 
good-looking woman. I know how lucky I am.

'But there are downsides to 
being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other 
reason than my lovely looks.'

These led to a strong of negative comments, but not all the reaction was against her.

Figures show Samantha's story was the second top trending topic at one point today after 'Dear Nicki'

India Andrews, from Los Angeles, California, said on MailOnline: 'You can't account for other people's reactions 
to you.

'I'm smart, and I've intimidated people in a conversation 
unintentionally many times or engendered jealousy in students during a 
class unintentionally as well.

'Just live your life, and if someone tries
 to get into your face about it, say "okay" and go about your life like 
normal.

'Don't try to engage them in a conversation about it. My 
experience is that you can't change their minds or their feelings.'

In another of the best-rated comments, Alan Smyth, from Middlesbrough, said: 'Obviously a truly gorgeous person both 
inside AND out.

'How sad to see the trolls sniping at her from 'neath 
their gloomy bridges, they can NEVER touch her however! Sail on serenely
 beautiful Ms Brick you deserve to laugh in the face of the jealous 
beasts.'

On Twitter, Sally Bercow, the reality TV star and the wife of Commons speaker John Bercow who is no stranger to being controversial herself, said sarcastically: 'I don't think I have had an Easter card. Ever. I bet Samantha Brick has had thousands...'

BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article asking: 'Why do people WRITE articles lies this? And why am I reading it?'

In an editorial entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' Stylist magazine also made its point.

TV illusionist Derren Brown was one of a number of celebrities who took to Twitter after reading the story

It said: 'We believe Samantha Brick has had some unfortunate experiences with friends and colleagues, but this article is just another example of women attacking women - the very thing Samantha complains about.

'We're proud when our friends look their best and, we imagine, so are you. It's genuinely pleasant to watch a colleague light up when you compliment her skirt, or to walk into a room and see your closest friend looking just perfect.

'Think of the joy we all get from seeing a woman we love as a happy, sparkling bride. Let’s treat each other with generosity: let's celebrate.'
