Four men who pleaded guilty in the repeated sexual assault of an 11-year-old Texas girl were each sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison, terms they agreed to in deals with prosecutors.

Their sentencing hearings came after another man charged in the 2010 case chose to go to trial and was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison.

Legal experts said his harsh punishment prompted the four to plead guilty and will likely mean the seven defendants with cases still pending will seek their own plea deals.

Sentenced: Kelvin King, 23 (left) and Jared McPherson, 20 (right) must register as a sex offender once they are released from prison

Sentenced on Friday were: Timothy Ellis, 20; his cousin, Rayford Ellis Jr., 21; Kelvin King, 23; and Jared McPherson, 20. All had pleaded guilty earlier this month to aggravated sexual assault of a child, and each must register as a sex offender once released from prison.

Rayford Ellis also pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a 2008 case, while King pleaded guilty to another aggravated sexual assault charge in a 2009 case involving an attack on a different girl. Each received 15 years for those charges and will serve those sentences at the same time as the ones for assaulting the 11-year-old.

Each defendant was allowed to hug family members before being taken away by authorities. All except for Rayford Ellis had been free on bail. Relatives of the defendants declined to comment after the hearings.

Defense attorneys and prosecutors also declined to comment, citing a gag order in the case.

During his sentencing hearing, King told the judge he was unhappy with his attorney, Jerry Andress, and his plea deal.

'I feel like, well, my lawyer really didn't talk about the case,' King said.

The only defendant to opt for a trial, Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison

Afterward, King's father, Kevin King, and Andress argued outside the courtroom about the sentence. Both men declined to comment to reporters.

Prosecutors say the girl, now 13, was sexually assaulted on at least five occasions by 20 men and boys in the Southeast Texas town of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston.

The girl was 11 years old during the assaults from mid-September through early December 2010. Police began investigating that December after a classmate of the girl's told a teacher he had seen cellphone video of men having sex with her.

All six juveniles and six of the 14 adults charged, including those sentenced Friday, pleaded guilty.

The only defendant to opt for a trial, Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison, but he wasn't in court to face his punishment.

McGowen, who had been free on bail, skipped out during a break on the first day of testimony, which included the girl's tearful recounting of the assaults and McGowen's role in them.

Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010

The
trial, held in the nearby county seat of Liberty, went on without him 
and a jury the next day convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a 
child and then sentenced him in absentia.

Authorities
tracked McGowen down to an apartment in northeast Houston and arrested 
him on 11 September. Six law enforcement agencies had coordinated the search 
for him. McGowen was apparently caught by surprise, as he was sitting on
a toilet when authorities entered the apartment and arrested him.

Prosecutors' case against McGowen 
included a videotaped confession and testimony from nearly a dozen 
witnesses, including the girl, who is now 13.

The
girl, who authorities haven't named, described the series of horrendous attacks that took 
place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston.

In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males.Â 

The girl said she was brought into 
what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and
others took turns having sex with her.

Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly.

But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks.

She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case.

She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.'

'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked.

'Yes sir,' the girl said.

The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified.

She
mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the 
floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding.

She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants 
called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that 
continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer.

Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.'

Jurors
were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers 
found inside and outside the house in the November incident.

During
opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present 
them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted 
to raping the girl.

'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said.

The prosecutor added that while the 
girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, 
these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things 
against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle.

Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records.

The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents.

Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticized those suggestions.

It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic.

The four men sentenced Friday accepted their plea deals after McGowen was tried and convicted.

Legal experts said the seven adult 
defendants who still have cases pending are probably going to avoid 
trial after seeing what happened with McGowen.

'Unless one of the remaining 
co-defendants has something brand new, we are not going to see any more 
trials from this point forward,' said Grant Scheiner, a Houston criminal
defense attorney not involved in the case.

Joel Androphy, another Houston 
attorney not connected to the case, said a 99-year prison sentence for 
one defendant would definitely scare his co-defendants into pleading 
guilty. But Androphy said he believes at least one of the remaining 
defendants will probably decide to take his chances at trial.

'Trials are a roll of the dice. You have to weigh it all and decide how to handle it,' the attorney said
