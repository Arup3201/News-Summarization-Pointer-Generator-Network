New York’s skyline has dramatically changed in ten years, as is evident in a series of before and after photos.

Streetscapes
 of sidewalks and people covered in ash clouds and buildings blown out, 
seen in remarkable images from 2001, have been captured a decade later 
from the same vantage point. 

The
 most obvious change is the loss of the Twin Towers and the creation of a
 new building, finally progressing up after years of delay..

Office workers flee as the towers fall, top, as the south tower collapses. Below is One World Trade Center rises and roads are redone

The under-construction One World 
Trade Center can be seen standing over the National September 11th 
Memorial and Museum in lower Manhattan ahead of the 10th anniversary of 
the 9/11 terror attacks next month.

The 9/11 memorial features two 
reflecting pools on the footprints of the twin towers and it is 
scheduled to be dedicated on September 11 this year.

Each pool has 30ft waterfalls on 
every side and the names of all 2,983 victims in the 9/11 and 1993 
attacks are inscribed in bronze.

lower Manhattan as the south tower collapsed and now. On the right is 
another angle before and after as the south tower starts to collapse and
 now as One World Trade Center rises up

Its
 designer Michael Arad wants the memorial, surrounded by 400 oak trees, 
to be somewhere for New Yorkers to come together - and described the 
area as a ‘scar’.

‘This is a scar, and it's a scar that 
is healing,’ Mr Arad told the New York Daily News. ‘It's not a scar 
we're going to hide. It's just part of day-to-day life in the city.’

Present day: The Statue of Liberty stands before lower Manhattan just before sunset in New York on August 24, just over two weeks ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center

It’s hoped the memorial will finally 
bring some peace to the families of 9/11 victims, who will be able to 
visit from the 10th anniversary next month.

‘My Michael is home finally,’ Monica 
Iken Murphy, 41, told the New York Daily News, of her dead husband Michael 
Murphy. ‘They're all home.’

The memorial will then be open to the 
public on September 12, but visitors need to make reservations in 
advance because of the construction work.

The museum is set to open on 
the 9/11 anniversary next year.

The foundation of World Trade Center 2 and 3 has been completed and the buildings are now at around street level.

One World Trade Center is at 80 floors and 4 World Trade Center is up to 48 of 72 floors, reported the New York Daily News.

Building work: Construction continues at the World Trade Center site on August 24 in New York City, with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to feature two reflecting pools on the footprints of the twin towers

Lower Manhattan: New York will mark the 10th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center with ceremonies on September 11 this year

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been criticised by politicians and religious leaders in New York for not giving clergy members a role in  ceremonies to mark 9/11's 10th anniversary.

'This is America, and to have a memorial service where there's no prayer, this appears to be insanity to me,’ Rudy Washington, former deputy mayor under Rudolph Giuliani, told the Wall Street Journal.

But the focus will be on family members of victims and Rabbi Joseph Potasnik said he understood the decision as it would be difficult for ‘everyone to have a place at the table’.
