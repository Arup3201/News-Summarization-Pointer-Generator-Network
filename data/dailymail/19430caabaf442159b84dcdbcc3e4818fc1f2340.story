A 9-year-old boy has his feet severed while attempting to climb onto a passing train in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

Around 5:30pm Thursday evening, neighbors witnessed Marshawn Farr-Robinson trying to climb the ladder of a slow moving train. He slipped and the train rolled over his feet.

Marshawn was spotted by 13-year-old Thomas Thornton who saw the boy crawling, and thought he looked hurt.

He asked his dad, Dave Thornton, to go check on him and the man found the boy crawling out of the weeds near the tracks with both feet missing.

Mr Thornton grabbed the severed feet and wrapped them in a t-shirt hoping doctors might be able to reattach them.

He was surprised by how calm the boy was. He seemed more concerned about someone finding and telling his mother more than anything else.

Mr Thornton's 15-year-old daughter stayed with the boy while her Dad got help.

'I kept asking him what his name was, what his birthday was. He answered everything. I was amazed at how alert he was. It's a miracle,' Jane Thornton told KSTP.

When emergency responders arrived, they immediately applied tourniquets to both of Marshawn's legs.

Marshawn was taken to Gillette Children's Hospital where he is currently recovering.

Marshawn's condition is unclear, as his family have asked for privacy.

People - children, especially - cross the tracks all the time according to long-time resident Barb Evertz.

She told the Star Tribune it's an 'ongoing thing' and that trains blow their horns louder when somebody is on the tracks.

She proposes fencing the tracks off.

Solution? Residents say the train tracks are an ongoing problem with kids crossing them all the time. Some believe the tracks should be fenced off
