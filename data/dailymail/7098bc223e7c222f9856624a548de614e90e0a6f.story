For those who feel the Barclays Premier League is becoming too predictable at the top end, it is always worth hanging around for Christmas.

There is a reason the English continue to chase leather in the cold while the rest of Europe holidays at this time of year and here, at a rather flabbergasted Etihad Stadium, was it.

Two ahead at half-time after goals from David Silva and Fernandinho, Manuel Pellegrini’s team emerged for the second period aware that Chelsea had dropped two points at Southampton and that a 10th successive win in all competitions would set a new club record and take to them to within a point of their great modern rivals.

Less than an hour later, however, City were being booed off by their own supporters while Burnley manager Sean Dyche was marching on to the field to congratulate his players.

His team had not quite managed to pull off the victory of the Premier League season so far but they had come strong at the champions to earn a point and prove that it is unwise to try to predict anything at this time of year.

Pellegrini — who can’t be much fun round the Christmas dinner table — will try hard to ascertain how exactly this happened. He may wish to start with the fact that Burnley looked fitter than his team. City have more players in their squad than Burnley but it was the home side who were throwing on substitutes in a bid to find some energy and a spark during the second half.

Burnley, meanwhile, finished the game with the same 11 they started with. A coincidence? Maybe. But the fact is that City looked leggy as the game became stretched and Burnley who dominated possession for the entire five-minute period added on by referee Kevin Friend.

Normally, we would have expected City to fly at Burnley for the 15 minutes that were played after Ashley Barnes equalised in the 81st minute, but during that time the home team had one chance, substitute Stevan Jovetic bringing a sharp, low save from Tom Heaton.

Burnley finished the game comfortably and went home with a point they deserved. Despite the fact they were two down at half-time, they had shown enough in the first 45 minutes to suggest they could hurt City. As it transpired, that all proved rather portentous.

City led from the 23rd minute and were two ahead shortly after the half hour. They had been first to show and threatened early through central defender Martin Demichelis, Samir Nasri and James Milner.

Interestingly, though, Burnley centre forward Danny Ings was already worrying Demichelis’ partner Eliaquim Mangala while Burnley midfielder Dean Marney had brought the first real save of the game from City goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Nevertheless, City broke through midway through the half. It was a neat goal from Silva, as he turned on to a Jesus Navas cross and shot low past Heaton in the Burnley goal.

Pretty soon City were two goals clear. This time Nasri was the player who was in control of things on the edge of the penalty area and when he decided to shift the ball sideways to Fernandinho the Brazilian stopped it, moved it a foot to his right and drove a perfect shot against the underside of the bar and into the goal.

It was a magnificent strike and one that looked to have sealed the result. Had Navas’ subsequent low effort from 12 yards not been saved by Heaton then we probably could have all gone home early.

 As it was, Burnley emerged for the second half to score a most peculiar goal and haul themselves back into things.

There seemed little danger as Ings delivered a cross-shot from the left but the presence of George Boyd — who appeared to get a slight touch — seemed to confuse Hart, who could only dive over the ball and deflect it into the net.

Pellegrini subsequently claimed Boyd had been offside, and he had a point. ‘Maybe we deserve some luck,’ smiled Dyche.

From that point, the game began to disintegrate, as matches at this time of year often do. As legs tired, it became stretched and it has to be said that this seemed to suit Burnley more than it did City.

Ings might have tested Hart had he not stood on the ball when played clear in the 54th minute, before central defender Jason Shackell headed over from a free-kick.

City, as you would expect, were still active as an attacking force and Nasri brought a fingertip save from Heaton with a low shot from the edge of the area.

They were increasingly less than convincing, however, and, when it came, Burnley’s equaliser was not that surprising. Ings had already seen one shot fly wide and Barnes had one of his own blocked by Demichelis before City found themselves pegged back with nine minutes left.

A free-kick from deep was lofted into the area and when the two City central defenders could only knock it down, Barnes connected with his right foot and lashed the ball past Hart with venom.

City were rather bewildered. This was something they hadn’t expected. Afterwards, Burnley’s Dyche didn’t seem quite as surprised.
