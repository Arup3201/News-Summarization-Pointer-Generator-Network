Congressional staffers are readying a tough new round of sanctions against Iran, just days after President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal that would significantly ease economic penalties against the Islamic republic in exchange for modest limits on its nuclear enrichment program.

Legislative aides to Senate Democrats and House Republicans told MailOnline that there's a consensus on Capitol Hill that the Obama Administration has bent too far in Tehran's direction. And their bosses have asked for a slate of legislative options by the end of the brief Thanksgiving recess.

'Somebody has to make sure the Middle East doesn’t explode,' an adviser to a senior Senate Democrat said Monday morning, 'and no one else seems to have their eye on the ball.'

Public enemy number one? Iran's President Hassan Rouhani is on Congress' front-burner as members for both sides of the aisle consider legislation that could force President Obama into a veto showdown over a new sanctions deal

Senator Marco Rubio said there's 'an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions' despite the White House's posture

'The weakest plan on the table': Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert Menendez backs a six-month trigger to give Iran ample time to keep -- or break -- its promises under its deal with the U.S. and other world powers

An aide to a senior House Republican said that he had already begun working with 'an outside expert' to draft legislative language that would be circulated among 'a small, select group' of congressmen.

'But this isn't your usual "us versus them" deal,' the aide said. 'Senior Democrats will see this draft too. And I'm betting it would be the only one making the rounds by the end of the week.'

Some Republicans on the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol are also spoiling for a fight over the Obama administration's surprising pact with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

Is the devil in the details?

Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday that '[t]here is now an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions' despite the White House's posture, 'until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities.'

Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has so far limited his 
comments to an endorsement of what another House aide told MailOnline is 'the 
weakest plan on the table,' one that would include a six-month trigger 
to give Iran ample time to keep – or  break – its promises under its deal with the 
U.S. and other world powers.

'I expect that the 
forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will 
provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before 
imposing new sanctions on Iran,' Menendez said Sunday.

President Obama echoed this line in his speech Saturday night.

'If Iran does not fully meet its 
commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the 
[sanctions] relief and ratchet up the pressure,' he said.

But
this approach won't meet with approval from many House Republicans who are 
just as eager to force Obama into a veto showdown as they are to 
demonstrate a tough-on-Iran posture going into the 2014 election season.

An anti-Iran video caught online fire over the weekend, depicting the Islamic republic's regime as virulently anti-American and hinting that Obama's deal with Rouhani is a foolish one

Not impressed: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham captured Capitol Hill's fears about the Iran nuclear deal, worrying that a huge carrot will help Iran ignore a tiny stick. 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' he said

'We're
going to be the stick in the mud,' predicted the second GOP staffer, who works for a House 
Republican on the Foreign Affairs committee.

'The president 
has committed us to a dangerous course of action, I think, and we're 
setting ourselves up to lose Israel as an ally. Lots of members here 
will be happy to paint Obama into a corner and make him veto tougher 
sanctions that what he just let Rouhani weasel out of.'

'And none of this six-month-grace-period nonsense,' he added. 'Let's do it now.'

Global reactions have been muted, with most world leaders expressing tepid support.

Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said his country 'has consistently called on Iran to exercise flexibility on the matter. We want to keep a close watch in a way to help implement this agreement.'

Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said his nation 'welcomes the prospect of resolving questions related to Iran's nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy.'

Closer to the Middle East region, reactions were more strident.

Syria 'considers it to be a historic accord which guarantees the interests of the brotherly Iranian people,' the Islamic regime's foreign office said.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that '[w]hat was achieved yesterday in Geneva is not a historic agreement but rather a historic mistake.'

Added pressure on U.S. lawmakers is coming from a YouTube video that has been seen by more than 1.1 million people since Friday.

Titled simply 'Iran Facts,' the anonymously authored video contains a laundry list of anti-American statements from Iranian leaders, read over a series of editorial cartoon-style drawings and a soundtrack full of riotous crowd noises.

During his recent presidential campaign, according to the video's narrator, Rouhani said that 'saying "Death to America" is easy; we need to express "Death to America" with action.'

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the video's creator – who requested anonymity – said that Americans 'need to know the Iran threat is not focused on Israel. That is a distraction.'

'Imagine if Israel did not exist,' he said. 'Then imagine what we would be thinking about "Death to America" [statements' from people who commit suicide on a regular basis and have a deliverable nuclear weapon.'

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called the deal 'dangerous' on Monday morning, noting that it fell short of the recommendations of the UN Security Council

Appearing Sunday on ABC's 'This Week'
program, Secretary of State John Kerry wouldn't respond directly to a 
question about whether the president would veto any new Iran sanctions 
Congress might pass.

'I 
believe Congress will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal
of benefit in it, and I look forward to going up and working with our 
colleagues on the hill in order to try to persuade them that this is not
the moment to increase sanctions,' Kerry said.

Kerry met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Sunday after taking part in the breakthrough talks that are temporarily curbing Iran's nuclear activity

Several Democrats in the Senate, 
where Kerry served before joining the Obama administration, have already
expressed dismay at what they see as a lopsided deal between the White 
House and Rouhani.

'This
disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that 
Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional 
sanctions when we return in December,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck 
Schumer said Sunday in a statement.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday on CNN that 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' against Iran, since 'the sanctions [already in place] actually worked.'

'But this interim deal gives the Iranians $7 billion in cash,' he complained, 'and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around.'

House Speaker John Boehner hinted on Sunday that America must maintain as much pressure on Tehran as the White House will allow.

Otherwise, Boehner said, 'we will look back on the interim deal as a remarkably clever Iranian move to dismantle the international sanctions regime while maintaining its infrastructure and material to pursue a break-out nuclear capability.'
