Former neighbours of the woman at the centre of the Prince Andrew 'sex slave' scandal have spoken out about the typical 'lovely' Central Coast mum with the alleged huge secret.

Residents of Glenning Valley, near Tuggerah, on the NSW Central Coast, were shocked by the allegations that 30-year-old Virginia Roberts was allegedly kept as a sex slave by Wall Street financier Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, local Cellarbrations bottle shop worker Sue Evrard said she was 'gobsmacked' by the allegations.

'She was lovely. She had two little boys and a little girl. She was always really pleasant,' Ms Evrard said. 

Ms Evrard said she was sad when Virginia decided to move back to the US with her Australian husband Robert Giuffre to be with her brother and his children.

She claims Virginia never mentioned she was affiliated with any member of the royal family and certainly never boasted about her alleged famous ties.

'When I saw it on the news I was gobsmacked. I just screamed "That's my Ginny," I just remember how she was a really good mum.' Ms Evrard said. 

Ms Roberts and her husband regularly hosted barbeques in the backyard of her home, which the Telegraph says is now occupied by Honor Symes.

Ms Symes described Ms Roberts as a 'lovely lady' and 'well liked' and said she was unaware of her previous life as an alleged sex slave.

'She has been in contact with some people over the past 48 hours,': Ms Symes said. 

Prince Andrew vehemently denies the claims made in a legal action by Ms Roberts that he abused her as an under-age girl at an orgy where she was being used as a ‘sex slave’.

The legal allegation states that Ms Roberts was ‘forced’ to have sex with the royal at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean.

She claims she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Epstein – the US paedophile who hosted the parties – and that she was converted ‘into what is commonly referred to as a sex slave’. 

FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’

SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’

SATURDAY EVENING, in response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’

Ms Robert's father Sky Roberts spoke out this weekend to support his daughter, who is now 30, and said her claims should be tested in court.

He said: ‘I brought up my children and that includes Virginia to always tell the truth … Why would she lie?’

In court documents, Ms Roberts – who is not named – says she was ‘procured for sexual activities’ for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell.

Ms Maxwell is alleged to have facilitated the prince’s ‘abuse’ of the girl. The legal documents, lodged with a Florida court, name Ms Maxwell as a ‘madame’ and a ‘primary co-conspirator in [Epstein’s] sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. 

She has previously branded all claims against her as ‘untrue’ and ‘obvious lies’. The court papers name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing ‘Jane Doe #3’ when she was 17 – under-age according to Florida state law.

Epstein, a long-term friend of Andrew, was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for under-age prostitution. The pair remained friends and were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release.

On Friday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’.

Andrew’s accuser countered the statement, saying via her lawyers that she is an ‘innocent victim’ and: ‘I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.’
