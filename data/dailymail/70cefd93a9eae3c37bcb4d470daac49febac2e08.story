Police say they've flushed out a man accused of stealing the handles and pipes of toilets in parks and restaurant restrooms around a Florida city.

St. Petersburg police said Friday that they arrested 28-year-old homeless man Brian Rinda. He is accused of stealing the plumbing from Cracker Barrel, Burger King, Bob Evans and other restaurants.

Police released a photo of a pile of metal toilet parts that they say Rinda stole.

Brian Rinda is accused of stealing the handles and pipes of toilets in parks and restaurant restrooms around St. Petersburg, Fla.

'He worked very fast within a matter of minutes,' police spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez told FOX 13 News regarding a theft at Subway. 'Many of the managers at the restaurants were telling us, well they had just walked out of the restroom and gone back in a few minutes later, and he had taken the flush valves.'

Police say Rinda caused about $1,000 in damage and traded the brass valve and piping at a county recycling center.

As most commercial victims had security cameras, there is plenty of footage of Rinda taking off with the handles and pipes.

As scrap metal yards must keep seller records, authorities can tie Rinda to multiple deals at County Recycling.  

Rinda is charged him with eight counts of grand theft and 1 count of petit theft

Owner James Roberto identified him personally, noting that in one transaction Rinda was paid $32 for 20 pounds of brass. 

Roberto read on his records: 'that was the item, and there's the picture ID, his picture, his fingerprint. 

Rinda was charged with eight counts of grand theft and 1 count of petit theft.

Rinda is being held in county jail on $20,000 bail.

It's unclear whether he retained an attorney.
