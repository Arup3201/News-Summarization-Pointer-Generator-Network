With her bulging muscles and intense fitness regime, Georgina McConnell isn't your average teenager.

The 19-year-old is a bodybuilder and has swapped mooning over One Direction for six meals a day, five workouts a week and an impressive 10st 3lb physique. 

And it would appear that the teenager's dedication has paid off, after she took home a gold medal in the UKBFF [UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation] North East Championships this summer.

Powerful: Georgina McConnell, 19, is determined to make her professional bodybuilding dreams come true

Georgina, of Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear, said: 'I absolutely love bodybuilding - it’s my life.

'My mum and dad are really into keeping fit, so there were always weights and stuff lying around the house when I was younger.

'I was about 17 when I decided I wanted to take up bodybuilding properly, although I was already quite stacked by then.

'I knew it was an unusual thing for a girl my age to want to do - most girls want to be thin and dainty - but I really love it.'

The teen, who is a statuesque 5ft 7in tall, revealed that her powerful frame had divided opinions among her friends, family and the opposite sex.

'My parents and friends are really proud of me and think I look great, but my brother is the total opposite - he doesn’t get the whole bodybuilding thing at all,' she said.

'I don’t have a boyfriend at the moment, but I don’t think my unusual hobby will put all boys off. Yes, some are a bit intimidated by my muscles, but others like them - I think  it’s an acquired taste.'

Tough: Georgina's routine includes six meals a day and intense workouts five days a week

But while Georgina is used to showing off her toned physique in a string bikini onstage, she is keen to cover up in everyday life.

'Although bodybuilding has really helped my self-esteem, I tend to cover myself up when I’m out and about,' she said

'If I don’t, people stare at me - especially at my arms and shoulders. I get a lot of compliments for my physique, but I get a lot of insults too - quite a few people have said nasty things about me in the past.'

But Georgina, who trains at professional bodybuilder Anth 'The Freak' Bailes’s Maxxmuscle Gym in Hetton Le Hole, hasn’t let the insults get her down and has upped her regime ahead of the British Championships, which are due to take place in Harrogate in October.

'I was delighted to qualify for the championships, but I am having to be very careful with what I eat,” she added.

Criticism: Georgina prefers to cover up when out and about as people are sometimes rude about her looks

'I have the same sort of stuff - rice, turkey and eggs - six times a day and  can’t go out for any nice meals with my family and friends.

'I get hungry every few hours anyway, so it’s not too bad, but it does make living a normal teenage life quite difficult.'

The determined athlete, who recently graduated from Sunderland College, said she dreams of becoming a pro bodybuilder with the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB).

'I really enjoy competing and would love to be a pro one day,' she said. 'I get quite scared before stepping on to the stage, but I’m alright once I’m up there.

'I’ve also made a lot of like-minded friends, like Anth, through bodybuilding, who keep me going and keep me focused. I would quite like to go to university at some point though, so I’ll just have to see what happens.'
