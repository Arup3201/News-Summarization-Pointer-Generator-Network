A historic Yorkshire marketplace will have its cobbles ripped up and replaced with modern block paving for health and safety reasons.

East Riding council said the traditional stones in Beverley's Saturday Market could 'cause problems for visitors and residents with disabilities' and has ordered crews to dig them up next week, causing uproar among townsfolk and English Heritage.

The conservation body has strongly advised against the plan and urged the council to keep the cobbles, which historians believe are at least 175 years old and probably date back to the 1700s.

Rage: A number of protest marches have been held to oppose the cobbles being ripped up in Saturday Market

Protest: Campaigners opposed to the removal of the cobbles bear signs saying 'What next? The Minster?' and 'Cobblers to the council'

It said the traditional surface is 'important to the historic character' of the market town, which is popular with day-trippers and tourists.

Residents have held 500-strong marches through the market square and presented petitions containing almost 1,000 names in a bid to halt the work.

However, town hall bosses said work will go ahead after they consulted community groups, including members of a disability advisory group, which were in favour of removing the stones.

History professor Barbara English, of Beverley Civic Society, said it was a 'hugely disappointing' and short-sighted decision in the face of 'an overwhelming amount of opposition'.

'This will destroy the town's historic atmosphere,' she said.

'Saturday Market, which is surrounded by listed buildings, is the absolute core of the town. This and the minster (an historic church in the town) are what people associate with Beverley.'

History: The cobbles in Saturday Market, Beverley, East Yorkshire are due to be removed next week because of health and safety concerns. Residents and historians have blasted the plans

Outrage: Marches attended by 500 people and a 1,000-signature petition have failed to dissuade town chiefs from removing the cobblestones

Legacy: The stones in Saturday Market are believed to be 175-years-old or more

Prof English said historic records show the stones were in place in 1829 and may well be from the 1700s.

But the council says many of the cobbles - or setts - were replaced or restored when they were uncovered from beneath a layer of tarmac in the 1980s.

Campaign group Save Our Setts, organised by Beverley Action Group, has held 500-strong protest parades through the town, which has a population of less than 30,000.

The Yorkshire town of Beverley is famous for its 13th century Minster, its market and its music festivals, which celebrate traditional and early music.

The medieval background of the town is reflected in street names like Toll Gavel, Butcher Row, Ladygate, Hengate, Wednesday Market and Saturday Market.

The Minster has Europe's largest collection of musician stone carvings.

It also boasts the 700-year old Percy Tomb, a masterpiece of European medieval art.

On the other side of town is St Mary's Church, which has a brightly-painted Minstrel pillar and a decorated ceiling depicting the Kings of England.

The church also has a carving of a pilgrim hare, which was said to be the inspiration behind Lewis Caroll's White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland.

Beverley's annual festivals of early music, chamber music and folk music attract visitors from far and wide and celebrate the town`s ancient tradition as a centre of musical excellence.

The town's Art Gallery is renowned for its permanent collection of Frederick Elwell paintings, a painter who once painted a portrait of King George V and lived in the town.

A spokesman called the idea 'a crude, inappropriate scheme that will remove these wonderful landmarks and change the character of Beverley's main square for the worse, forever'.

He added: 'The setts, pavements, curbs and gullies are an essential part of the cultural heritage of this town and a major feature of Saturday Market, drawing visitors from around the UK and abroad.'

English Heritage said East Riding council asked for its advice about changes to the marketplace in 2012, which also include upgrading pavements and increasing pedestrian areas as part of a Â£2.5million scheme.

An English Heritage spokesman said: 'We believe it is possible to improve the market area and still keep the cobbles, which are important to the historic character of Beverley.

'We were supportive of the proposals in principle, although we advised there were elements of the scheme which could be changed to be more sympathetic to the historical character of the conservation area and the 40 listed buildings in the area.

'We advised that it was better to keep the cobble stones rather than remove them completely and only remove them where wheelchair access was needed.

'This advice was given before East Riding submitted their official planning application and since then we have heard nothing from the council on their plans for the area.'

Saturday Market's large market square is still used by traders and is lined with conservation-listed Georgian, Victorian and other historic buildings.

It contains a 300-year-old market cross that is Grade I listed - the highest historic protection possible, reserved for 2.5% of all listed structures including Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and York Minster.

Nigel Leighton, director of environment and neighbourhood services at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the cobbles 'can cause problems for less able-bodied people or those using wheelchairs and prams'.

He said a number of community groups, including the town council, chamber of trade and the Disability Advisory Monitoring Group were consulted.

What a mess: In November bungling council workers enraged residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, after wrecking historic cobblestones by covering them with thick yellow paint

He added: 'The proposed scheme is a good compromise of all the feedback received by the council from groups and individuals who represent a broad cross-section of Beverley's 30,000 population.

'Work on the scheme will begin next week and the council has agreed to look into reclaiming the setts and other historic materials to be set aside for use in Beverley.'

Several years ago, plans were put forward to transform the market square into a continental-style piazza, complete with fountains and trees. They were ditched following a public outcry.

In November residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, were furious after council workers clumsily daubed double yellow lines on Georgian cobbles in an historic square.

The paint dribbled down the stones leaving an unsightly mess in St Mary's Place in the town, a popular tourist destination.

James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence.'
