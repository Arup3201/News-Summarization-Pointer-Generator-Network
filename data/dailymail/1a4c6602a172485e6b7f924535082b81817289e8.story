A New York architect described as being 'STD-ridden' and having a 'micro-penis' in a scathing collection of online articles is suing an academic who he claims is a former lover and author of the blog.

John Wender, 53, has filed a lawsuit against Louise Silberling who he claims set up websites smearing his reputation. 

He is seeking up to $1.25million in damages after alleging that the pair met online in March 2011.

However, Ms Silberling, an editor at Cornell University’s Philosophical Review, has expressed her shock at being sued and said any allegations against her are bogus. 

Mr Wender, manager of Bartolone Wender Architects in New York's Chelsea district, said the pair went on three dates but then stopped seeing each other.

About a year later a series of articles appeared online on websites including  truthaboutjohnwender.wordpress.com, john wenderliar.wordpress.com and liarscheatersrus.com/johnwender.

Campaign of hate: Screengrabs taken from the websites have been presented in the lawsuit

According to court documents, one post says he has a 'micro-penis' who engages in 'animal role play'. 

Many of the posts are accompanied with photographs of a smiling Mr Wender. 

Mr Wender, who lives in Harlem, told The New York Daily News: 'We only went on three dates. It's affected my life, it's affected my kids' lives. She's insane.' 

The defamation lawsuit was filed on Tuesday at Mahattan Supreme Court.
