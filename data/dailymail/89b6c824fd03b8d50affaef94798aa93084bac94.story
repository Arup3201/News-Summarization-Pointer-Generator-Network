Charlie Edwards has revealed his dad gave up his day job to help his son realise his dream after the 21-year-old was announced as Matchroom's latest signing.

Edwards has turned professional after leaving Team GB to join Eddie Hearn's outfit, five months after he lost in the Commonwealth Games.

And he will make his paid debut at the O2 Arena on January 31. 

Charlie Edwards decided to join Eddie Hearn's Matchroom team after turning professional 

'I'm so excited to turn over,' he said. 'I was on the GB squad for six years and I can't wait to fight and show everyone what I'm capable of.

'The qualification system has changed and you have to go to all these countries and you just don't get the decision out there. I put a lot of effort in but didn't get the credit.

'After the Commonwealth Games I thought it was time for another chapter.

'I sat down with me dad and my team and I thought my style suits the pros. Eddie Hearn will take me on leaps and bounds.

'He [my dad] used to own his tyre-fitting business but we couldn't train around my area.

'We had to travel so its a full-time job for him.

'Even though I'm the one training, he has to get up to take me to my hill runs.

'I've got to thank him for everything he's ever done for me. Not it's time to make him proud.'

Edwards will fight in the flyweight division and already has the best of British in his sights. 

'There's Kevin Satchell and Iain Butcher but I reckon I've got the beating of them all day,' he said. 'The division is open for the taking.'
