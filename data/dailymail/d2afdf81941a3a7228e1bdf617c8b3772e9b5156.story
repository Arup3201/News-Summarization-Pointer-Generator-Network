A Philadelphia folk musician and environmental engineer was killed by a falling tree while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maryland this weekend. 

The National Park Service says 36-year-old Jason Parish died Sunday morning when high winds brought down a dead tree near an overnight shelter in Maryland. 

The park service says Parish and two companions began hiking north from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, Friday.

Recording studio owner Ernest Tokay says Parish was a talented member of Philadelphia's folk music scene who released his debut album, A Mountain and a Hill, in January.

Tokay says Parish often went camping, even in the winter, sometimes at a moment's notice. 

‘It was his thing,’ Tokay said. ‘He seemed to enjoy what the rest of us would call very torturous conditions.’

According to the park service, the call about the deadly accident came in just after 9am Sunday.

The accident took place along Yourtee Road off of Route 67 in Washington County between Yarrowsburg Road and Brownsville Road, on a steep and rocky section of the trail near the Ed Garvey shelter. 

Agency spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles says an off-duty park ranger who was nearby performed CPR on Parish, but to no avail.
