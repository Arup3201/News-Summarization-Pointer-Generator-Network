With Jose Mourinho’s talk of a campaign against Chelsea highlighted after Anthony Taylor’s refusal to award them a penalty in their last game and my Sportsmail colleague Martin Keown questioning Phil Dowd’s big-match temperament, the official went in to this match under a lot of pressure.

His performance and that of his assistants was very good.

In the right position

Often criticised for a lack of mobility, Dowd used all of his experience to ensure he was in the right place to judge key decisions. He’ll never be the quickest around the pitch but knows the game and that came to his aid when caught well behind play when Eden Hazard broke away but was dispossessed by Federico Fazio.

Keeping discipline

Getting through until the 65th minute before issuing a first yellow card always helps. The only player to escape when he should have been disciplined was Gary Cahill when he kicked out at Harry Kane. The FA could well act retrospectively to further frustrate Mourinho.

Getting the big decisions spot on

Referees are judged on the big decisions and here Dowd did very well. Chelsea wanted a penalty when the ball hit Jan Vertonghen’s hand in the first half. But Vertonghen had his arm in a natural position and with his body weight holding him down he could not avoid contact with the ball. Spurs’ penalty cannot be disputed as Cahill missed the ball and brought Kane down inside the area. In the second half, Hazard appeared to be tripped by Fazio when clean through. Replays showed the Spurs man got the ball first and there had been no infringement.

Overall assessment

An excellent performance in which the officials got every big decision right and did nothing to adversely affect the outcome of the game. Mourinho might do better to work with his defenders rather than focus on officials after this display, and perhaps his ‘campaign’ theory is merely an attempt to protect his stuttering team.
