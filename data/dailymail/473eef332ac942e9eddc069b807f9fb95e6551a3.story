A baby boy born with four arms and four legs is causing panic in the streets of Baruipur, east India, as locals believe he is the reincarnation of a god.

The child has been named God Boy, as multiple limbs are common among Hindu deities, and people are travelling from across the region to the city in West Bengal State to get a glimpse of the child.

Local police complain they are struggling to control the crowds, as hundreds cry in the streets and clamor to get access to the hospital.

God Baby: A baby boy born with four arms and four legs is causing panic in the streets of Baruipur, east India, as locals believe he is the reincarnation of a Hindu god

The boy's birth defect, two extra arms and two extra legs, are the remains of an underdeveloped co-joined twin.  

The family are overjoyed at their new addition and see him as the son Hindu God Brahma, who is depicted with eight limbs.

 'When he first came out we couldn't believe it,' , an unnamed relative not named told local TV:

'The nurses said he was badly deformed but I could see that this was a sign from God.

'In fact, this is a miracle, its God's baby. Indian God's have extra limbs just like this.' 

Chukka Rao, 67, from a neighbouring village, said: 'When we first heard about God Boy we were slightly skeptical.

'But we came to see because we were intrigued by all the news we were hearing from friends and others.

'When we eventually saw a pic of the child it was a wonder. 

But with the village being overrun by curious believers from across the region, local police say they are having trouble controlling them.

A police spokesman said: 'This is a freak baby and it is tragic, there is nothing godly about him at all.

'But the crowds are going berserk and clamouring to see the child.

'Hundreds are crying in the streets, hundreds of others are praying and setting up camp here.

'Some are even panicking and believe this is a sign of the end of the world. I have never seen anything like this in my whole career.'

The child's family member added: 'It is understandable that there is a lot of excitement about this.

'It is only natural that people want to see the God Baby.'
