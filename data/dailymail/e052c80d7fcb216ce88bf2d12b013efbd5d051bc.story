Lifelong Liverpool fan Rickie Lambert could wear the club’s iconic No 7 shirt vacated by Luis Suarez  - with Benfica winger Lazar Markovic picking another number ahead of his £20million move to Anfield.

Markovic will meet club officials in Merseyside on Sunday and is expected to complete his transfer in the next 72 hours to become Brendan Rodgers’ fourth signing of the summer and the first of the post-Suarez era.

The Uruguayan’s £75million departure to Barcelona has led to huge interest over who will wear No 7 next season – a jersey made famous by Kevin Keegan and Kenny Dalglish.

Getting shirty: Rickie Lambert could wear No.7 at Liverpool next season

Flying in: Liverpool are set to sign Lazar Markovic from Benfica in a £20m deal

Markovic, who wore No 50 for Benfica, has already had his shirt request accepted by the club and other signings Adam Lallana and Emre Can have been handed numbers 20 and 23 respectively.

That leaves the door open for 32-year-old Lambert to complete a fairytale having been released by his hometown club as a youngster.

The striker wore No 7 for his former club Southampton but no decision was taken about his shirt number for Liverpool until the Suarez saga was settled.

Now, Kirkby-born Lambert will discuss the situation with manager Brendan Rodgers and decide between them if the extra significance of the jersey will work for both sides.

However, it is unlikely Lambert would want to turn down such a historic opportunity having made an emotional return to Merseyside this summer after coming through the ranks at Blackpool, Macclesfield, Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton, and going on to play for England in the World Cup.

Barca bound: Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona has freed the No.7 shirt at Anfield

Following the sale of Suarez, Rodgers is looking to  strengthen his squad in a number of areas ahead of the club’s Champions League campaign for five years.

Swansea City’s Wilfried Bony is just one of a number of options being looked at in attack with Belgian World Cup striker Divock Origi still to decide whether he wants to sign for Liverpool from  Lille, though he would be loaned back to the French club right away.

Southampton and Croatia defender Dejan Lovren remains a target too, though his club are so far refusing to sell.

Rodgers also wants a left-back with Ben Davies from Swansea among his options.

Meanwhile, Suarez may not even set foot in England again following his move to Spain.

Banned from any training ground for four months following his bite on Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup, there are no plans yet for the player to say farewell in person to his former team-mates.

Suarez lived in a plush rented home next to Strawberry Fields - made famous by The Beatles - in south Liverpool but could arrange for the removal of all his belongings without going back in person.

Ironically, Barcelona are preparing for their pre-season at England’s HQ in St George’s Park but Suarez can not play until October and is prohibited from taking part in any football activity until then.
