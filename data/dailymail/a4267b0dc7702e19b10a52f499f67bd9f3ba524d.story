Controversial: Josie Cunningham had her breasts enlarged to 36DD on the NHS - and now wants them reduced, as well as compensation

An aspiring glamour model who had a £4,800 taxpayer-funded breast enlargement is to sue the NHS because her new assets are too big.

Josie Cunningham, of Leeds, said her 36DD breasts have ruined her life by making her the target of online abuse. 

It is the third time the unmarried mother-of-two has demanded money from the taxpayer.

Not only did they foot the cost of her breast enlargement, but Miss Cunningham is now insisting on a reduction and compensation.

She claims she was not properly consulted before her operation and wants compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress.

Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, has consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [the NHS] for every penny’.

She said: ‘I want in excess of £10,000. Anything I can get over that is a bonus.’

The 23-year-old came under fire after revealing the details of her taxpayer-funded operation, which came while far more deserving cases failed to receive NHS funds.

Miss Cunningham, who was told she had no breast tissue due to a congenital condition, was allowed the treatment in January after complaining about being bullied since the age of 14 over her flat chest.

Funding was recommended by her GP and she underwent surgery in January at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, boosting her bust from a 32A to a 36DD.

Two months later she showed off her new figure to tabloid newspapers in the hope of launching a lucrative career as a topless model.

At the time she said her new breasts gave her the ‘confidence’ to pursue her dream and that she hoped to emulate former Page 3 girl Katie Price, also known as Jordan.

But she claims her assets have not helped her career and she now wants them reduced - also on the NHS.

Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘I was rushed through the process. I didn’t actually ask for 36DD — I would have been happier with a B cup.

‘But they told me that because I didn’t have any breast tissue I’d have to go for bigger breasts. They haven’t helped me one bit. In fact, my life is ruined.’

Within hours of her revealing her 
intention to sue, internet users posted angry comments on Twitter 
expressing their disbelief at her shamelessness.

Nicola Allen posted: ‘Is Josie Cunningham for real? NHS do your boobs for free when women that really need it have to pay, & now you sue?’

Twitter user @ellchaplin9311m added: ‘That Josie Cunningham is a disgrace. Attempting to sue the NHS because her boobs are too big! It isn’t your boobs ruining your “career”.’

Another user, @SDFFPodcast10m, posted: ‘Josie Cunningham who got a free boob job will sue the nhs for ruining her life, I think I’ll sue her for ruining my view of humanity.’

But others were more scathing branding her a ‘waste of space’, ‘dirty piece of scum’ and ‘worthless human’. Another posted: ‘Josie Cunningham your boobs haven’t ruined your life. Your face has.’
