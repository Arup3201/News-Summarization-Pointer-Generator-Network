A 28-stone nursing home worker who abused elderly vulnerable people by sitting on them was yesterday jailed for nine months.

Fiona Salmon, 40, also pinched, slapped and manhandled those in her care during the campaign of physical and verbal cruelty.

She sprayed deodorant in an elderly woman’s face, threw talcum powder at another and rubbed one female resident’s head so hard she made her nose bleed.

Heavyweight: Fiona Salmon, a 28-stone care home worker, was found guilty of sitting on elderly residents

The court also heard how Salmon would dig her nails into her victims and punch them.

On one occasion she threw a 
99-year-old onto her bed and pushed the same woman’s wheelchair into a 
closed door, an act the judge described as ‘extremely callous’.

She even slapped an 89-year-old man 
who was suffering from skin cancer and made rude comments about him. 
Salmon also slapped an 85-year-old resident.

Colleagues of the care assistant watched in horror as Salmon sat on residents’ legs to stop them getting up.

They told how she gave residents, who 
were all of reduced mental capacity, names such as ‘grubby b****’ and 
told them their breath stank of dog mess.

Jailed: Salmon was sentenced to nine months in prison and the judge said it was 'extremely unlikely' she would work in care again

Salmon was previously found guilty of 
seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents and yesterday was 
jailed at Truro Crown Court.

Judge John Neligan told her: ‘You were
there to care for them because none of them, physically or mentally, 
could do it themselves due to ill health.

Home: Salmon was a care worker at the Cornwallis Nursing Home in St Ives, Cornwall

‘All these seven people were entitled 
to be treated with respect and dignity in the closing years of their 
lives which you denied to them, thereby abusing them in a callous and 
unkind way.

‘During the course of the trial I 
detected no remorse or regret whatsoever and you have continued to deny 
you did anything wrong and that you did your job well.’

Salmon, from Camborne, in Cornwall, 
carried out her campaign of abuse at Cornwallis Care Services nursing 
home in St. Ives between June 2011 and January 2012.

During her trial earlier this year her
colleague Joanna Clarke gave evidence against her. She said: ‘One 
morning Fiona washed a resident’s face with a flannel so hard that it 
caused a nosebleed. I also saw her squeezing talcum powder into a 
woman’s face and she called her a grubby b****.’

She added: ‘Her behaviour was 
humiliating and there was no compassion. She spoke to them 
disrespectfully; as if they were not worth anything and as if they were 
an inconvenience.’

Another colleague, Stephanie Fielding, said at her trial: ‘We were putting a patient on her bed but she did not want to stay.

‘Fiona decided to sit on her legs to 
force her. She cried out and shouted at Fiona to get off as she was 
hurting her but she just laughed and carried on for a couple of minutes 
until I told her to get off.’

Judge Neligan said it was ‘extremely unlikely’ that she would ever be a care worker again.

Jo Martin, defending, said Miss Salmon
carried out the abuse because she had become tired working nights and 
was also in a bad relationship at the time.
