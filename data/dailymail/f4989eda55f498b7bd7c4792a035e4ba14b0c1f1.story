For newlywed Kirsty Taylor-Pendlebury, thinking of her wedding day brings a tear to the eye.

But they are not the tears of joy you would expect.

Rather, reliving the day - which was four years in the planning - conjures up memories of being rushed to hospital with her new husband Carl, both struck by violent food poisoning.

The 26-year-olds managed to quickly utter the words 'I do' before their wedding planner called an ambulance.

The newlyweds from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, were left doubled over in agony, suffering vomiting and diarrhoea on their £14,000 big day.

Once admitted to hospital, the couple spent their first night as husband and wife in adjacent hospital beds.

Newlyweds Kirsty Taylor-Pendlebury and her husband Carl, on their wedding day in Turkey on August 8. The couple ended up in hospital after being struck down by food poisoning

The devastated maths teacher said she cannot stomach looking at their wedding album, because she and her husband look so unwell in the pictures.

She said it will take them years to save enough to pay for another wedding, because they are still paying for the first, after using credit cards to fund their 'dream' big day.  

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We are heartbroken. I can't think of our wedding day without wanting to cry. 

'We’d planned our day for years and I still can’t believe it was totally ruined.

‘Your wedding is supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life, but ours was like hell and we are still paying for it every month which means we can’t save for another.’

The couple who met at school when they were 14, got engaged in 2010 after graduating from the same university.

They soon began planning their big day and eventually decided on an idyllic waterside wedding in the sun.

In 2012, Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury booked a luxury ceremony in Oludeniz, Turkey, to take place in August this year and began planning all the final details, including arriving at the service by speed boat.

The couple spent their first night as husband and wife in hospital suffering gastroenteritis 

The couple flew out to meet their guests from the UK in perfect health.

But when they woke days later on the morning of the ceremony on August 8, Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury complained of stomach cramps.

She said: ‘They were getting worse but everyone was convinced it was just wedding day nerves. 

'They kept telling me to calm down and I hoped they were right.’

But the pain worsened when she was having her hair and make up done and guests reported that the groom was also suffering.

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘I had never felt so ill. I was holding my stomach in agony with cramps and I couldn’t stay off the toilet.

‘When I heard Carl was the same I thought we were never going to make it down the aisle.’

When the best man reported the groom was curled up in the foetal position on the bathroom floor in their hotel suite Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury wanted to cancel the ceremony.

She said: ‘Carl insisted that we carry on. We had waited so long to get married but it was turning into a nightmare.’

While on the speedboat left Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury was forced to lie on the floor of the boat trying not to vomit on her wedding gown.

When she arrived at the beach she was shocked to see just how ill her groom looked.

‘Carl was green,' she said. 'He was pacing up and down and sweating buckets with a fever. I was worried sick.’

They managed to speedily exchange vows before Mr Pendlebury had to dash off to the toilet again leaving his bride to toast their wedding alone.

She said: ‘I could hardly raise the glass to my lips because the smell of alcohol when she you fell that sick is horrendous.’

Both were unable to face the lavish wedding feast they had splashed out on.

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury, said: ‘The sight of food when you feel like you are dying is horrific. 

'We had to walk away and poor Carl was vomiting into the sea while we waited for guests to finish their meals.

Suffering vomiting and diarrhoea, the couple could not face trying the wedding breakfast they had chosen

‘The heat made it even worse because we were both sweating with fevers.’

The couple were left gagging when they cut the wedding cake and spent their first dance rooted to the spot trying not to throw up.

With bride and groom spending more time on the toilet than with their guests they had to admit defeat, instructing the wedding planner to end their celebration two hours early.

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘Trying to get a wedding dress on and off to go to the toilet is hard enough at the best of times, let alone when you are in a hurry. I just wanted the whole thing to be over with.’

But first the struggling couple were taken back to the speedboat for their wedding pictures.

Mrs Taylor –Pendlebury said: ‘I was crying and lying down holding my stomach between shots but doing my best to smile for the camera because I wanted to have at least one nice picture of us on our wedding day after waiting for it for so long. 

'Carl turned bright green every time we hit a wave. We couldn't wait to get off it.’

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: 'We’d planned our day for years and I still can’t believe it was totally ruined'

The couple's wedding planner was forced to call an ambulance after Mr Pendlebury became so ill he could no longer enjoy the reception. They were forced to cut short their big day by two hours

During the cruise back to the hotel with their guests Mr Taylor was so unwell that their worried wedding planner called an ambulance.

When they docked it was waiting to rush him straight to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with severe dehydration and gastroenteritis.

Desperate to stay with her groom on their wedding night, the newlyweds were moved to a room in the maternity ward where Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury slept next to her husband in a camp bed.

She said: ‘We were too ill and upset to even talk. It’s not how either of us imagined our wedding night. The whole thing had been a disaster.’

The groom was discharged the following morning and the newlyweds spent the next five days in their hotel room recovering.

Meanwhile several other wedding guests started suffering the same symptoms and were also diagnosed with gastroenteritis.

Mrs Taylor said: ‘We had eaten at several local restaurants so it could have been any of them that made us ill.’

The couple cannot afford to pay for another wedding because they are still paying for the first, having put the majority of the cost on credit cards

Family and friends are hoping to raise money to help the couple pay for a new ceremony to replace their bad memories for their first big day

But it was only when she started to feel well again that the true cost of their wedding disaster hit home.

She said: ‘I just couldn’t stop crying. The wedding we had looked forward too for so many years had been totally ruined.

‘It was horrific. We both flew home feeling utterly distraught and disappointed.

‘When I saw the wedding pictures we both looked so sweaty and sick I couldn’t even stomach looking at them.’

But the couple won’t be able to afford to pay for a new wedding until they finish paying for this one.

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We don’t earn a lot so we put most of it on credit cards. 

'Seeing the payment go out every week for a wedding both of us would rather forget about is soul destroying.'

Friends and family are now trying to help the couple raise funds for a new ceremony to replace the bad memories of their last one.

Mrs Taylor-Pendlebury said: ‘We would love to have a ceremony where neither of us is dashing of to the toilet or vomiting.’
