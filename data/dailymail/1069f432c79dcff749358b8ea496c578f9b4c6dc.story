After a bitter divorce, Victorian woman Audrey Trevena desperately wanted a fresh start.

She dreamt of a new, exciting life like her idol, ‘amazing’ reality TV star Kim Kardashian.

Instead of just dreaming of becoming a celebrity like Kim Kardashian though, Ms Trevena took it one step further and decided to 'become her' – officially changing her name to Kimmi Kardashians.

Kimmi Kardashians was born Audrey Trevena and changed her name to Kimmi Kardashians when she wanted 'a fresh name and a fresh start' after her divorce in 2010

Ms Kardashians says she feels 'heaps better' and has much more confidence after changing her name

It cost her just $98.80 to make her dream come true when she officially changed her name in 2010 and it has completely transformed her life.

The reality TV fan is thrilled with her new name, telling Daily Mail Australia that she is ‘so proud to have the same name as a celebrity.’

‘I feel heaps better! I love Kim Kardashian and wanted to have her name because she’s such a lovely lady and I just like the name Kimmi.’

The mother-of-five says that she feels like she and US glamour Kim Kardashian now ‘share a special connection’ after her name change.

‘She’s a mum and I’m a mum. I like everything that she’s into. The modelling, the photoshoots… I’d love to do all that.’ 

The fulltime mother says that many people often think her name ‘is a prank’, but when they realise it’s actually her legal name ‘they love it.’

‘I have trouble sometimes when I try and book a taxi. I tell them my name and the taxi won't come because they think it was a prank.’

‘Once, I was applying for an online job based in America. The man said “I don’t believe that that’s your name. This is a joke.”

‘He wouldn’t believe me, no matter what I said.’

The Melbourne woman says she would like her own reality show but would be concerned about her five children's reactions to being surrounded by video cameras

The 47-year-old says that Kim Kardashian embodies everything that she wants for herself.

‘She’s just wonderful. She’s a famous actress, I love the way she acts and the way she dresses.

‘She looks like she’s a fun person to be around by the looks of her show. She’s amazing.’

Ms Kardashians, who is looking for a new job, admires Kim Kardashian's entrepreneurial skills. Her new name has boosted her confidence and given her a new lease on life.

‘I love the photoshoots she does, the shop where she sells clothes,' she said. 

I’ve always wanted to make a perfume like her and I hope to one day make my own exotic scent,’ Ms Kardashians explains. 

As a woman who loves to be made up and wear beautiful clothes, Ms Kardashians was ecstatic to be involved in a photo shoot recently, explaining that it 'made her feel like a million bucks.'

'I got my hair done, I got my make up done, it made me feel special and wanted.

'I did different poses and wore different clothes. I got to feel like Kim Kardashian. 

The Hampton Park resident would love to have her own reality television show like Ms Kardashian, but she also has her reservations, explaining ‘I don’t know how the kids would go, having all the cameras around.’

Ms Kardashians laments that she did not give her own children names starting with the same letter like the Kardashian family did.

The Kardashian girls were famously named Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie by their mother, Kris.

The Melbourne mother also says she ‘really loves Kim’s baby’s name, North West.' 

Ms Kardashians does have a history of being inspired by television, as she named her 22-year-old daughter Penny after a character in ‘Lost in Space’ and her daughter Chloe, 13, after a Home and Away character.

All of her children are incredibly proud of their mother for her name change, which also includes her son Ashley, 23, and daughters Natasha, 15, and Amanda, 12.

‘They’re happy for me and my name change, they say “we love you Mum and we love your new name change”’, says Ms Kardashians.

‘They’re sweet, they’ll call out “Kimmi!” just to see me turn around with a happy look on my face.’

Ms Kardashians sister and one of her brother refuse to call her Kimmi, as they are ‘used to calling her Audrey’, but her other relatives, including her mother, and all her friends happily call her by her name name. 

‘When my name was changed and I had my new birth certificate I was over the moon, it was so amazing.’

‘Now I feel a lot more confident having Kim Kardashian’s name.

‘It’s a great ice breaker and starts a lot of fun conversations. I’m having fun with all those benefits of having the name Kimmi Kardashians.'

Ms Kardashians would like to tell Kim Kardashian about her name change, but she ‘doesn’t know how to get in contact with her’.

Ms Kardashians does not have Twitter or Instagram, unlike her ‘Social Media queen’ Kardashian, who boasts 26 million Twitter followers and has 22 million fans following her every move on Instagram.

Perhaps one day they can connect on Facebook – although the Aussie Kimmi K laughs that she only has six Facebook friends.
