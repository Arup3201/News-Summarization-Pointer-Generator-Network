Amazon is getting into the movie business.

The online shopping giant is to significantly expand into movie production by acquiring films for theatrical release and slash the time before they are available online. 

The new venture will shrink what has historically been a three-month window reserved for theatres, instead getting movies to its website four to eight weeks after theatrical release.

Amazon's entry into movies also comes on the heels of Sony Pictures' unprecedented digital distribution of the Seth Rogen comedy 'The Interview,' the first major studio film to be released simultaneously in theatrrs, online and on video-on-demand platforms.

Top North American theatre chains have vigorously protested such moves. 

On Friday, Patrick Corcoran, vice president of the National Association of Theater Owners, fired back at those who saw Sony Pictures' digital release of 'The Interview' as a sign of things to come.

Corcoran said the movie's release 'doesn't change anything,' and noted that its two-week $31.5 million digital gross was far less the film would have made at multiplexes.

Roy Price, vice president of Amazon Studios, said the company's goal is to produce 12 movies a year, with production beginning later this year.

'Not only will we bring Prime Instant Video customers exciting, unique and exclusive films soon after a movie's theatrical run, but we hope this program will also benefit filmmakers, who too often struggle to mount fresh and daring stories that deserve an audience,' said Price.

The announcement marks a new foray into the movie business for the online retail giant, which has in recent years developed a slate of TV series since Amazon Studios launched in 2010. 

Most recently, its acclaimed 'Transparent' won two Golden Globe awards, including best comedy or musical series.

Independent film producer Ted Hope, who co-founded the production company Good Machine, will oversee creative development for the new unit, Amazon Original Movies.

Hope co-founded and ran Good Machine, a production company behind some Academy Award-nominated films, including 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' and 'Eat Drink Man Woman.'

Amazon Original Movies will focus on unique stories, characters and voices from 'top and up-and-coming creators,' according to the company.

The move marks the latest major digital player pushing into Hollywood's movie business. 

Netflix last year inked deals with Adam Sandler and the Weinstein Co.

But new entrants such as Amazon and Netflix don't have to worry about theatre chains the way Hollywood studios do. Any Amazon Studios movie release will likely only play in independent theaters.
