For years, the 'Kung Fu' gland somehow escaped the attention of endocrinologists.

But one student has clearly found it... according to his hilarious answer to a biology exam question (complete with surreal sketch).

And what about the meaning of the term 'hermaphrodite'. That would, apparently, be 'Lady Gaga'.

Welcome to the wonderful world of Funnyexam.com - a website crammed with astonishingly bad answers given by students in both the UK and US.

Discovery of the legendary 'Kung Fu' gland, according to one student on Funnyexam.com

See the top right corner, so that you're quite clear they're talking about a 'horse'...

Now that's a 'hard' exam question

Teachers have so far submitted hundreds of 'epic fail' responses by pupils, covering maths, science and just about every other subject on the curriculum.

And it does make you wonder what exactly is being taught in schools.

One pupil had the perfect answer to: 'Briefly explain what hard water is'.

They wrote 'Ice'.

Equally amusing are the comments made by exasperated teachers.

Take this 'feelings' study below - where 'Enough is enough Judy!' has been written on the naughty pupil's answer sheet. Well, they did call the poor boy ugly.

It is not clear whether all the exam answers are genuine.

Indeed, all references to the schools in question have been censored, so it would be impossible to authenticate them.

The teachers' submissions have all been rated and you can filter the pupils' answers by newest, most popular or just random.

Ranking is determined by the number of thumbs-up by 'huffers'.

And it seems to be a popular pastime - as some have received more than 2,000 votes.
