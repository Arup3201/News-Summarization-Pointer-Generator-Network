Jonathan Ross, whose return to BBC Radio 2 covering the Steve Wright show, has drawn 100 complaints 

It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air.

And it seems many Radio 2 listeners have yet to forgive Jonathan Ross for the outrage. When the 54-year-old presenter stood in to host two music and chat shows, he drew 100 complaints.

Ross had been hired to cover the afternoon show last Friday and again on Monday while Steve Wright was on holiday.

But some listeners wondered what he was doing back on the airwaves.

In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Sachs’s answering machine. 

The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls.

Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks. 

He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode.

Listeners questioned the choice of Ross to stand-in for Wright. One wrote on Twitter: ‘All is forgiven then? Didn’t think @wossy would ever “darken” hallowed BBC premises again.’ 

Another posted: ‘And Jonathan Ross is on BBC Radio 2 hosting a show because? My God, just shows you can get away with anything and still asked back. Shameful!’

Others said they had switched their radios off, with one tweeting: ‘Disgrace they let this clown back on radio. Never again please.’

Although Ross – who left the BBC in 2010 after it decided not to renew his £18million contract – has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. 

Last night Sachs’s wife Melody said of Ross: ‘I think it’s dreadful that he’s back at the BBC. I don’t like it because of what he did to us. They carry on regardless. He’s never off the box now, is he?

‘He can do what he likes – walk over anybody, say what he likes. I just put it out of my mind and can’t be bothered any more. 

'But I’m careful to switch the TV or radio off when he’s on. It’s not very nice, especially the way Andrew’s worked all his life for the BBC on radio and TV. It’s an absolute insult, really.’ 

 In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Andrew Sachs’s answering machine. His wife Melody says it is dreadful he is back on the BBC 

Ross will cover another ten shows for Wright next month. The presenter, who has also been guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute since his fall from grace, hosted Wright’s show for four days over the August bank holiday weekend last year, for which he was paid an estimated £4,000.

Last night a Radio 2 spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster... and was very popular with our audience.

'He returned to Radio 2 last year for four days and following the warm welcome he received from the listeners, he will cover for Steve Wright in March.’
