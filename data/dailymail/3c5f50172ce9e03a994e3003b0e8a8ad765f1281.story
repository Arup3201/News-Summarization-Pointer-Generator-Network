The showpiece genocide and war crimes trial of the 'Butcher of Bosnia' Ratko Mladic was dramatically halted in The Hague today after an extraordinary and embarrassing blunder by prosecutors.

Presiding judge Alphons Orie suspended the hearing of the former Bosnian Serb General indefinitely after prosecutors failed to disclose thousands of documents to the defence team.

Incredibly, prosecutors had over 16 years while the 70 year-old, the one-time military commander accused of orchestrating the Srebrencia massacre of 8,000 men and boys, was on the run to prepare for the case.

But yesterday they acknowledged their mistakes which judge Orie described as 'significant disclosure errors.'

The announcement could lead to a six-month delay and is seen as a major setback for the court in one of its highest profile cases, its final trial to focus on atrocities committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, which left over 100,000 dead.

The proceedings are being broadcast live in Bosnia where Bosnian Serbs, who consider Mladic a hero, mocked the court greeting the decision with a mixture of laughter and applause.

But for the families of Srebrenica's victims and other Bosnia atrocities it was a 'heartbreaking' blow and yet another delay in their quest to see the man they blame of the deaths of tens of thousands brought to justice.

Mladic is said to have suffered two strokes and heart problems while on the run and the fear of many Bosnian Muslims is that they will be robbed of justice again.

And like ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic he will die in custody before a judgement is reached.

Judge Orie said the court will analyse the 'scope and full impact' of the error and aim to establish a new starting date 'as soon as possible.'

The presentation of evidence was supposed to begin later this month and Mladic's attorney has asked for a six-month delay.

Mladic faces 11 charges - ironically, several were dropped in a bid to speed-up the trial - and life imprisonment if convicted.

He is accused of commanding Bosnian Serb troops who waged a campaign of murder and persecution to drive Muslims and Croats out of territory they considered part of Serbia and oversaw the 44-month siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, that killed 10,000.

Court spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said much of the material not given to the defence focused on witnesses who prosecutors had intended to call to testify.

Details of the evidence against Mladic had been outlined in chilling and graphic detail to the court before the sudden suspension of proceedings. Prosecuting counsel Peter McCloskey said the crimes at Srebrenica had never been in dispute so the prosecution's focus would be on individual criminal responsibility.

He claimed the Bosnian Serb Army was not an 'army out of control' and that Mladic had been on the ground and in command. 'We have radio intercepts of VRS [Bosnian Serb] soldiers and officers discussing murders,' Mr McCloskey said.

He added: 'We have video of two of the actual executions themselves. So let me be perfectly clear, the crime will not be the main focus of this prosecution. This case will be primarily about one issue. The individual criminal responsibility of Ratko Mladic.'

The court watched video of local people panicking in a UN compound outside Srebrenica on 11 July 1995 as Bosnian Serb forces approached, followed by scenes of Mladic triumphantly entering the town.

'We give this town to the Serbs as a gift,' he says to the camera.

Another video playing in court showed Mladic addressing a bus full of Muslims, telling them: 'Good afternoon. You heard stories about me for a very long time. Now you are looking at me.

'I am General Mladic. There are able-bodied people among you. You are all safe and you are all going to be transported to Kladanj. We wish you a safe journey. And Good-bye.

'Take care. You who are of a military age, don't go to the front again! No more forgiveness. Now I am giving you your life as a gift.'

Another prosecutor Dermot Groome said that by the time Gen Mladic and his troops had 'murdered thousands in Srebrenica', they were 'well-rehearsed in the craft of murder'.

Mr McCloskey outlined how, after overrunning Srebrenica, Mladic's forces summoned buses and trucks from across Bosnia to transport women and girls out of the enclave.

The men and boys were then driven to remote locations and gunned down by firing squads, their bodies ploughed into mass graves.

He said the remains - sometimes no more than a couple of bones - of 5,977 victims have been exhumed so far.

He showed photographs of an exposed mass grave to underscore the point that the victims were not war casualties.

One photo showed a skull, its teeth exposed and its eyes covered by a blindfold. Another showed a pair of hands bound with a strip of cloth behind a body's back.

One woman, Hatidza Mehmedovic, wept in the court's lobby during a break in the proceedings.

'I buried both of my sons and my husband. Now I live alone with memories of my children,' she said. 'I would never wish even Mladic to go through what I go through.'

It took 17 years to bring Mladic to trial in what observers say is a testament to the loyalty he inspired among Serbs and the power of their nationalist cause.

But as Serbia's goal of integration with Europe overtook its defiance, he lost his comfortable protection.

And by the end he was reduced to sheltering, penniless and sick, in a cousin's farmhouse.

The son of a World War Two partisan fighter killed in 1945, Mladic was an officer in the old communist Yugoslav Federal Army (JNA) when Yugoslavia's disintegration began in 1991.

When Serbs rose up in 1992 against Bosnia's Muslim-led secession, he was picked to command the army that swiftly overran 70 per cent of the country.

It was a model of ruthlessness, daring and brutality in the Serb warrior tradition once prized in the life-or-death struggle against Nazi Germany.

But NATO officers who dealt soldier-to-soldier with Mladic when UN evenhandedness was official policy later came to regret shaking his hand.
