A Russian stripper and lingerie model needed surgery after a manicurist she criticised filed her nails so short her fingers were left bleeding and swollen.

Maria Lomovskikh, 20, visited a beauty salon to have her nails done, but told manicurist Anastasia Kretova she was disappointed about the quality of her work, calling it 'shoddy and unprofessional'.

She claims that, in response, the beautician filed her nails so close to the skin her fingers began bleeding, leaving her in 'absolute agony'.

Agony: Russian model Maria Lomovskikh (pictured) needed surgery after her fingernails were filed too short

Painful: She claims she was left in 'absolute agony' when she went home with two of her fingers bleeding

Tender: She then went to hospital, where she was diagnosed with having acute purulent inflammation of two nails

'I was criticising the woman because she was using dirty nail files and wasn't disinfecting her instruments.

'But then she went mental, and I realised she had filed them with such ferocity that they were bleeding.'

After going home to bandage her wounds in her home city of Voronezh, southern Russia, she eventually had to go to hospital where she was diagnosed with having acute purulent inflammation of two nails and had to have them removed.

Igor Korotkiy, the head surgeon who carried out the operation, said that surgery was the only option because of the mutilation caused to the model's fingers.

He added: 'The damage was so bad the only thing we could do was to take them off completely. It is difficult to say if they will ever grow again.'

Now the model has decided to pursue legal action against the beauty salon. 

Fined: Manicurist Anastasia Kretova was docked £30 of her wages after the beauty salon conceded the damage she had done

Legal: Ms Lomovskikh has now decided to sue the salon, saying the injuries have affected her modelling career

Model: Ms Lomovskikh claims to have lost out on three jobs because of the injuries caused by the incident

Ms Lomovskikh said: 'I have lost three jobs because of the deformity caused by this woman and I have been told that I will not be able to model lingerie or cigarettes again. 

'I want her and the salon punished for this.'

A spokesman for the beauty salon said: 'We understand the lady's complaints and we have accepted responsibility and punished the beautician concerned by deducting £30 from her pay.'
