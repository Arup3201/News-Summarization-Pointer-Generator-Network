Authorities are preparing for possible race riots if a white police officer who shot dead a black teenager is not indicted on murder charges.

A grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, 18, on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri.

Police officers in Missouri are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios, while also talking with other major police departments around the country.

Civil unrest: Police officers are preparing for riots in Missouri if police officer Darren Wilson (above) is not indicted by a grand jury for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown

Tragedy: Brown (above) was unarmed when he was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9

The FBI said it was also involved in the discussions.

In differing accounts, police have said Brown struggled with
Wilson, 28, before the fatal shots were fired, but some witnesses say
Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot
multiple times in the head and chest.

If charges are not brought against Wilson, police fear an
outbreak of violence not just in the St. Louis suburb of
Ferguson, but across the greater metropolitan area and even in
other U.S. cities, according to St. Louis County Police Chief
Jon Belmar and others involved in the planning meetings.

James Knowles, the Ferguson mayor who has attended the
meetings, said the concern is that 'the unrest is going to be
far beyond the city of Ferguson.'    

Protesters and civil rights groups say Brown's death is part
of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number
of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers,
an allegation police deny.

Nationwide riots: Protests, like the one above in Ferguson on October 4, could turn into riots around the nation and in major cities like L.A. and New York if Wilson is not indicted, officers believe

Missouri law enforcement officials have been in contact with
police chiefs in Los Angeles, New York, Florida  and other jurisdictions as they prepare for the grand jury
decision.

Of the 227 people arrested between August 10 and September 9 in
connection with protests over Brown's death, 36 were from
outside Missouri, including seven from New York, 12 from
Illinois and five from California, according to arrest records
provided by the St. Louis county police. 

One focus of the meetings has been on how to respond in the
event of riots, the police chief said. Police faced a public
backlash when they initially deployed armored carriers and
carried military-style assault rifles after Brown's shooting.

Representatives of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St.
Louis County Police, St. Louis city police and Ferguson police
have been attending the meetings, Belmar said. 

The top FBI
official in St. Louis, Agent William Woods, attended a strategy
meeting last week, said St. Louis FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu.

It was announced last week
that the St. Louis County Police will take the lead from the
tiny Ferguson force in patrolling the city's streets.

The contingency planning comes as black and white residents
of Ferguson brace for the grand jury decision.

The nine white and three black jurors have heard evidence
from dozens of witnesses, including Wilson, who has been under
police protection at an undisclosed location since the shooting,
said Bob McCulloch, the chief St. Louis county prosecutor
overseeing the grand jury proceedings. 

Jail: Protesters can be seen above leaving a Missouri jail, where 227 people were arrested in connection with protesting Brown's death between August 10 and September 9 -  36 of whom were from outside the state

Many African Americans in Ferguson seem to have little faith
in the grand jury process and expect Wilson will not be charged. 

It is rare for a U.S. police officer to face criminal charges
after shooting a citizen in the line of duty.

'I do believe if Darren Wilson is not indicted you will see
a lot of carnage ... There is a lot of explosive energy,' said
Tef Poe, one of the protest leaders. 

At a rally held by Black Lawyers for Justice in a Ferguson
church last week, eight members of the New Black Panther Party,
a black political group, provided security.

'We are tired of dead bodies in our community,' Mauricelm-Lei Millere, an advisor to the New Black Panthers,
shouted at the audience. 

'We are not going to take it anymore.'
