This is the cute dog that suffered a slow and agonising death at the hands of a female solicitor who 'couldn't cope' with the responsibility of looking after her.

Katy Gammon, 27, abandoned five-year-old boxer
 Roxy while she stayed with her mother, leaving the dog to spend six 
days clawing at the door until she went blind, slipped into a coma and 
died.

Gammon and her former boyfriend Adam Taylor, 24, adopted Roxy together but split up soon after, with Taylor saying his ex-girlfriend later contacted him to say she was struggling to look after the dog.

Cute: Five-year-old boxer Roxy because her solicitor owner 'couldn't cope' with the responsibility of looking after her

Cruel: Katy Gammon  (right) abandoned five-year-old boxer Roxy (left) while she stayed with her mother. She left the dog to spend six days clawing at the door until she went blind, slipped into a coma and died

Horrific: Roxy the five-year-old boxer died a long, painful death after being locked in the kitchen by trainee medical negligence solicitor Katy Gammon, 27. She was only found when a neighbour saw swarms of flies

When Gammon returned from her mother's home a week 
after abandoning Roxy, the stench through her letterbox was so strong that she could not face 
going inside.

She then returned to her mother for another nine weeks.

Roxy's dead body was only discovered when a neighbour
 saw a swarm of flies at the kitchen window, and was so decomposed that an 
RSPCA inspector had to scrape her body off the floor with a shovel.

Gammon, is now facing prison after 
admitting two cruelty charges, and has lost her job with leading 
Bristol law firm Lyons Davidson . She will be sentenced on April 9.

Mr Taylor said he was shocked and horrified at hearing how Roxy died - and could not understand why his former girlfriend had failed to get help.

Affectionate: Roxy (pictured with Adam Taylor) originally belonged to a friend but developed anxiety problems after being left alone all day

Adorable: Adam Taylor worked evening shifts and Gammon worked in the daytime, so they thought that between them someone would always be around to look after Roxy

Punishment: Gammon, is now facing prison after admitting two cruelty charges relating to her treatment of Roxy.  She has lost her job with leading Bristol law firm Lyons Davidson and will be sentenced on April 9

Gammon had appeared to dote on the dog during the time they were together, he told the Bristol Evening Post.

Roxy originally belonged to a friend but developed anxiety problems after being left alone all day.

As Mr Taylor works evening shifts and Gammon worked in the daytime, they thought that between them someone would always be around to look after Roxy, so agreed to adopt her in December 2012.

But five months later the couple split up - with Gammon saying she would take on the sole responsibility of looking after Roxy.

Mr Taylor says that within a few months, Gammon contacted him to say she was struggling to cope and was looking for a new home for Roxy.

No explanation: When the RSPCA showed Gammon, pictured leaving Bristol Magistrates' Court, the horrific photographs of her dog's body she told the inspector: 'I don't know what you want me to say'

Abandoned: Adam Taylor says that within a few months of them splitting up, Gammon contacted him to say she was struggling to cope and was looking for a new home for Roxy. SHe abandoned her instead

When they spoke a short time later, Gammon told him the dog was now with her sister.

Mr Taylor said he then heard nothing until police contacted him in November 2013 with the news that Roxy had been left to die.

During a hearing at Bristol Magistrates' Court, Gammon admitted she last fed the dog at the end of August.

The animal welfare charity, which prosecuted Gammon, described the case as one of the worst it has ever dealt with.

Pet: Gammon had appeared to dote on Roxy, her ex-boyfriend Adam Taylor claimed

Horrified RSPCA inspector Chris James had to remove the dog's body with a shovel.

He said a stream of maggots had crawled from the kitchen down the hallway - to where there were tins of dog food on a table.

When shown photographs of the scene Gammon added: 'I don't know what you want me to say.'

Gammon
 pleaded guilty to one count of causing unnecessary suffering to an 
animal, and another of failing to prevent causing unnecessary suffering 
to an animal.

The two offences each carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possible fines of £20,000.

'I had no idea about the extent of what happened - the police only told me part of it,' Mr Taylor said.

'Katy
 was great with the dog when we were together, that’s why I’m so 
confused. She played with toys, treats, and we took her out for walks 
together the odd time, although granted I did it most days.'

'Katy
 and Roxy used to be cuddled up in bed and on the sofa together all the 
time. I would walk in from work to find them both cuddled up on sofa 
watching telly. When we were together she was great to the dog.'

'I had a feeling something was up when she said she couldn’t cope with her anymore - I just wish I could have done more.'

Offender: Gammon, who Bristol Magistrates' Court heard was sorry for her actions, pleaded guilty

Mr
 Taylor claims he had no idea that Gammon locked the dog in the kitchen 
each day, as before he left the dog was behaving better.

He added: 'I don’t know why Katy didn’t ask for help - she’s got lots of family and friends in the area.

'She told me her sister had the dog and she lied to her family, telling them I had her.

'I
 want to make it clear that I had absolutely no idea what was happening 
to Roxy - if I’d have known I would have stepped in straight away.”

Gammon is due to be sentenced on April 9.
