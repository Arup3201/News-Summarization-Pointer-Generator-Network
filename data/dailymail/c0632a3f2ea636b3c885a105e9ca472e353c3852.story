A bank robber accused of raiding more than a dozen banks in New York lost all of his stolen cash playing roulette in Atlantic City.

Dorren Singh, 26, of East Harlem, allegedly robbed 12 banks in Manhattan, one in Queens and one in The Bronx during an eight-month crime spree lasting from January until his arrest on Thursday.

The bandit was eventually caught after being filmed on CCTV ditching his bank-robbing disguise in a Manhattan subway, reports say.

Out of luck: Dorren Singh was arrested by police when he returned to his home in east Harlem after blowing $32,000 of stolen cash in Atlantic City

According to a police source after raiding his last bank, Singh caught a bus at Port Authority Bus Terminal and rode it down to Atlantic City 'to meet girls and have fun', reports the New York Post.

They added: 'He met some girls and hung out. And he slept over in one of the hotels'.

But Singh had far less luck at the roulette table at Bally's casino as it nearly wiped him out - leaving him with only enough cash to buy cheap clothes and food.

And while he was blowing his stolen fortune, detectives in New York were piecing together CCTV footage to identify him.

When Singh returned to his home in east Harlem on Thursday, investigators were waiting to arrest him.

He was charged with robbery for the 12 Manhattan bank heists, and is awaiting charges on the two other thefts.

Karma: After getting away with $32,000 in stolen cash, the bandit (pictured above in several CCTV clips collected) was not so fortunate in the casino

Singh has one conviction for criminal sale of narcotics in 2009 and has also been arrested for minor offenses, including criminal trespass and turnstile jumping.

It is believed that the casinos where Singh played and lost are not responsible for repaying the money.
