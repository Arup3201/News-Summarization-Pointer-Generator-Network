This is the moment a bungling driver got his 45ft-long lorry stuck between a pub and a cafe after blindly following directions from his sat nav.

The vehicle and its driver were stuck in the narrow bend for half-an-hour until police removed fencing from the pub's beer garden to make room. 

The lorry was on its way to a Muller dairy factory when it became stuck in the road in Market Drayton, Shropshire. 

The lorry and its driver became stuck between the Kings Head Inn and Gill's Pudding Cafe in Market Drayton 

Mark King, landlord of the King's Head pub, watched the man try to drive into the narrow street without any knowledge of how tight the space was. 

'I was in my garden having a coffee when I saw the lorry trying to turn.

'It was a 45-foot wagon and the driver tried to take the corner and in the end became totally stuck.

'We were shouting at the driver to stop but I don’t think he spoke very good English.

'I had to call the police because he had blocked the road, and he was there for about 30 minutes or so while they worked to unblock him.'

Mr King said he had seen lots of trucks and lorries try to trying to make the turn before, but none had ever become lodged in between his pub and the cafe across the road. 

It was the first time anyone had become stuck in narrow bend, said pub landlord Mark King 

'We do see a lot of trucks trying to turn down here and it is very tight, really too tight for that kind of vehicle.'

'Ideally we could do with stopping lorries turning down here, but I’m not sure how we can do that.

'On saying that this is the first time I have seen a lorry get wedged here, and well that’s sat navs for you.'

Gill Smith who owns Gill's Pudding Cafe said: 'Sat nav was certainly no help to this driver looking for Mullers. 

'The front of the shop here is glass fronted and he must have only been about three inches away from that, it was very close. We were lucky really.

'We do get articulated lorries coming down here, but to be honest they usually don’t try and turn in like this chap did.'
