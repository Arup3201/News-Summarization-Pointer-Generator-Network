Manchester City were crowned Premier League champions having occupied top spot for just 15 days of the campaign.

And that, Sportsmail can reveal, is the shortest-ever period spent at the summit of the table by the eventual league winners.

The champions: Manchester City spent 15 days at the top of the Premier League

Pace-setters: Arsenal, inspired during the first half of the season by Aaron Ramsey, spent 128 days at the top

Dominance: Manchester United were top of the Premier League for 261 days in 1993/1994

The Manchester United side of 2003 spent just 30 days at the top in 2002/03, Arsenal having been the long-term residents that season.

And it was again the Gunners who kept pole warm for the bulk of this term, occupying top for 128 days. Even David Moyes' United were leaders for two days back in August.

The longest-ever spell at No.1 has been Manchester United in 1993/94 when they enjoyed 261 days out in front.

But City have now set a new record low with their 15-day stay. Ultimately, though, it matters not, and having won their final five matches, Manuel Pellegriniâ€™s men timed their ascent to perfection.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through the number of days spent at the top of the Premier League by the champions (statistics supplied by Opta)...
