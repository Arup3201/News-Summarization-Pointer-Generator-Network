If anyone doubted the need for Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to splash out £25 million on Wilfried Bony, he would be happy to show them the opening 45 minutes at Goodison Park as exhibit A.

Pellegrini was in tetchy mood despite watching his side stretch their unbeaten run to 14 games, and it had nothing to do with midfielder Frank Lampard and his ‘loan’ saga.

City dominated Everton, particularly in the first half, and yet register just two efforts on target. When the home side were vulnerable, Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas missed the target horribly after being set up by David Silva. And they were not the only culprits.

City fans were glad to see Sergio Aguero reappear as a sub after his absence with a knee injury, and Edin Dzeko will also be back soon.

But if Bony had played instead of Jovetic, City would surely have gained an important win to stay level on points with Chelsea at the top, rather than fall two points behind. Swansea want a lot of money for their Ivorian striker but Pellegrini would like his bosses to pay up. ‘We had big chances to score in the first half, but if you don’t score you don’t win,’ said the stony-faced City boss. ‘It’s our own fault. We pressed well, we created chances, but we finished in the wrong way.

‘Every team will drop points from now until the end of the season. We never thought this was an easy game and it is always difficult at Everton. Maybe it was a good draw but I can not forget about the first half, we had too many clear opportunities.’

City’s lack of accuracy did not seem to matter when Fernandinho headed in from close range after Silva’s shot had been parried by keeper Joel Robles.

But Everton, belying a side that had lost their last four league games, deservedly levelled when Steven Naismith got in ahead of City skipper Joe Hart to head in a Leighton Baines free-kick.

It was a 45th Premier League assist for Baines, a new record for a defender, and confirmed Naismith’s reputation as a scorer against the top teams. He has now netted against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and City.

‘It was an old-fashioned game,’ said Everton boss Roberto Martinez, after a match played in high winds and heavy rain. ‘We allowed Manchester City too much space in the first half but showed a lot of character and grit after we went behind.’

By the end, nobody could have knocked Everton for gaining a point. The better chances fell to them, mainly because Romelu Lukaku made £32 m defender Eliaquim Mangala look like a park player.

Lukaku sprinted past Mangala in the first-half and forced a wonderful one-handed save from Hart, and Mangala later climbed all over Phil Jagielka as they contested a corner. ‘I’ve seen them given,’ said Martinez. Despite City’s recent form, the club had suffered a torrid week after having to admit they had misled people over the terms of Lampard’s spell at the club.

It seems the former England midfielder had signed a 12-month contract with City even though it was believed he was on loan from Sheik Mansour’s other club in the MLS, New York.

Here, though, it was Silva who set up the chances, only for his team-mates to miss. Jovetic, most vulnerable to Bony’s arrival, fired high over Robles’ goal after an incisive pass from his Spanish team-mate put him through. Navas did not do much better, scuffing an untidy finish wide from eight yards.

Jagielka then had to stretch to block a Silva shot and after Jovetic had done the difficult work by dribbling past Mo Besic, he failed to convert the finish. Samir Nasri then took a heavy touch when put through by Silva, and even Silva did the same when set up by Navas.

Everton were all at sea, with Aiden McGeady given catcalls from home fans, but whenever Lukaku got one-on-one with Mangala, Everton posed a real threat. The Belgian was denied at the near post by Hart ,with Seamus Coleman hitting the bar on the rebound.

Yet Aguero’s introduction — unsurprisingly replacing Jovetic — seemed to inspire Everton. They had a goal disallowed when Jagielka tapped in after an offside Naismith had challenged Hart.

But City then scored in a move started with some brilliant defensive work from Pablo Zabaleta. City burst up the right-hand side and when Nasri switched the ball inside to Silva, the Spaniard had a shot that looped up from Robles into the path of Fernandinho who headed in the 74th minute. Yet Everton showed tremendous character and bounced back to level just four minutes later.

Once again, it was the left foot of Baines that created the danger. He curled in a free-kick following a foul by Zabaleta and Naismith timed his run to perfection to get in front of the City defence and ahead of Hart to head in before the England goalkeeper could punch the ball away.

Pellegrini sent on Lampard for the final eight minutes and he got some pantomime boos from an increasingly involved Goodison crowd. This time, though, there was no fairy-tale ending for him, or City.
