Power giants who are hitting customers with price rises of around ten per cent are only paying 1.7 per cent more for the energy they’re selling.

Figures from the energy regulator, Ofgem, show that the wholesale cost of energy has risen by just £10 per household in the past year to an average of £610.

However, most bills are due to rise by more than £120 to almost £1,500.

Dark times: Ofgem figures reveal that the average profit margin made by the energy firms has more than doubled in the past year from £45 to £95 per customer

The same Ofgem figures reveal that the average profit margin made by the energy firms has more than doubled in the past year from £45 to £95 per customer.

The figures show an average annual energy bill of £1,320 in October. The average margin of £95 equates to 7.1 per cent for the six firms. 

The revelations leave suppliers open to allegations of profiteering as their bosses prepare to face a grilling today by MPs over price rises. Any suggestion that increases have been driven by a desire to cash in rather than an increase in costs will infuriate customers.

Charities have predicted some 24,000 deaths as a result of medical problems made worse by living in cold conditions.

Today a further study suggests eight in ten people will be rationing their energy use this winter. Energy costs are the top household worry for nine in ten consumers, ahead of the rising cost of food (75 per cent),  and petrol prices (66 per cent).

The figures were collated by price comparison firm uSwitch.com, whose consumer spokesman, Ann Robinson, warned of an energy bills crisis. ‘This  winter we will be seeing even more going without adequate heating for fear of racking up a bill they cannot afford,’ she said. ‘The Government has got to get competition working as this is the only way we will get to see fairer pricing.’

Ofgem is responsible for regulating the 
energy market; ensuring there is strong competition and that customers 
are not being ripped off.

Mr Cameron has announced an investigation into whether there is effective competition in the energy market. Downing Street is thought to be looking at replacing Ofgem with a watchdog with more teeth.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to give Ofgem a whole-hearted endorsement, raising questions about its future. Asked if the regulator was doing a good job, he would only say: ‘Ofgem has an important role.’

Labour’s energy spokesman, Caroline Flint, seized on the Big Six’s rising profit margins to accuse ministers of failing consumers. ‘If energy companies won’t treat their customers fairly, then people deserve tough action from the Government,’ she said.

The left-leaning IPPR think tank said the profit margins taken by the energy suppliers are too high. Associate director, Will Straw, said: ‘Profits in other sectors like supermarkets are as low as 2 per cent.’

Chief executive of Energy UK, which speaks for the industry, Angela Knight, said firms have faced higher wholesale price rises than the ‘theoretical calculation set out by Ofgem’.

Miss Knight said big increases in green taxes and the cost of government eco schemes were also responsible for price rises.

Ofgem insisted that its figures were reliable.

Experts at Which? say they have come up with measures that could slash £1.8billion from annual energy bills. The consumer group’s action plan includes halting the roll-out of smart meters and removing the cost of the Warm Home Discount, a system of grants for the poor, from energy bills.

Which? also calls for the break-up of the energy market so the supply and sale of power are no longer controlled by the same small group of firms.
