Atlanta-area officials are pulling no punches in dealing with an impending ice storm after their bungled response to one last month left the city paralyzed for days.

The city cancelled classes for Tuesday and Wednesday and was soon followed by suburban DeKalb County – Governor Nathan Deal (R) has also declared a weather-related state of emergency in 45 counties and begun preparations in advance.

Forecasts are calling for anywhere from about six inches of snow in northern suburbs to a combination of snow and ice similar to the one that paralyzed the country’s ninth-largest metro area.

Moving in advance: Deal speaks during Monday's news conference where he declared a state of emergency in 45 counties

Governor Deal appears to be trying to make good on his vows after the last storm to never allow the mayhem that ensued to happen again under his watch.

‘I'm willing to accept whatever blame comes my way,’ Deal said in the immediate aftermath of the previous storm. ‘And if I'm responsible for it, I'll accept that.’

He accepted the blame, and now he’s trying to prove he learned from those mistakes while armed with an ominous forecast days in advance.

'We are making every effort to be prepared for these events,' the governor said at a Monday news conference.

Deal convened the emergency management committee formed after the last storm at 11.00a Monday morning to plot out their plan of attack, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

A state of emergency was declared in 45 separate counties and schools were closed for multiple days - this time Deal is taking a proactive approach.

'We're not looking back, we're looking forward,' he added. 'The next three days are going to be challenging.'

A nasty mix of precipitation that constantly changes from rain to snow to sleet and back again is expected to cause significant icing and snow accumulations for millions of people not generally accustomed to winter weather.

The ominous forecast left at least a few residents skeptical of whether it could be handled effectively.

'I'm not counting on it,' Terri Herod said as she was buying sand and a shovel at Home Depot. 'I've been in Georgia on and off for 20 years. It's usually the same scenario, not enough preparations and not enough equipment.'

College student Jay Ali expressed a similar sentiment.

'I don't think they have the infrastructure to protect themselves if a storm gets really bad.'

Here it comes: Steady precipitation is expected for all of Tuesday

The icing: Tuesday night will see a shift to sleet and freezing rain for downtown Atlanta and it's southern suburbs

‘Rain Monday night will mix with and possibly change over to snow or a snow/sleet mix by sunrise Tuesday morning,’ the weather service told the Journal-Constitution.

‘Precipitation will likely change back over to rain before transitioning again back to a mix of rain, sleet and snow Tuesday evening,’ the Weather Service continued. ‘By Wednesday morning, expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain, finally transitioning back to snow by Thursday morning.’

A quarter of an inch of ice or more is expected to accumulate in the city. That dire forecast forced the hand of city officials in cancelling school and getting their ducks in order to combat the ice and snow.

Counties north of the city will see mostly snow, but those south will see what could amount to a historic icing event.

Half of an inch of ice or more will likely plague the area, bringing down trees and power lines while turning roads into death traps.

This has prompted Governor Deal to plead
 with motorists to stay off the roads and for trucks especially to avoid
 Interstate 285, which loops around the city as wide as 12 lanes - all 
of which stood still during and after the last ice storm.

Airlines have only cancelled a dozen flights into or out of Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, In Atlanta, according to FlightAware, but that number should rise sharply.

Not much better: Wednesday is expected to see much of the same

Finally coming to an end: The storm is expected to be finished by Thursday, as it lifts off towards the northeast

Pictures from January’s ice storm showed horrific pileups involving dozens of cars, miles-long traffic delays and pictures of stranded people sleeping in a Home Depot.

At least 2,000 children spent hours stuck in schools and 13 people were killed in traffic accidents and other freak occurrences.

A baby was born on I-285 and Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman was famously saved from the side of the road by retired former teammate Chipper Jones – who showed up on a four wheeler.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s front page ran the headline ‘How did this happen?’ with an ice-covered highway leading directly into the city just after the storm.

‘Today Show’ meteorologist lashed out at
 officials, saying the nightmare was caused not by the storm, but by 
‘poor planning on the mayor and governor's part.’

‘Daily Show’ host John Stewart lampooned officials saying they didn’t have the latest forecast by pointing out the Weather Channel’s headquarters is in Atlanta.

'The ice age zombie doomsday apocalypse has come to Atlanta,' sarcastically quipped.

That storm dumped only 2.6 inches on downtown Atlanta, along with some ice accumulations. This storm is set to be much worse.

By closing schools early and moving assets into place ahead of time, officials look to be much more ready for round two.

Precipitation across the region is expected to start falling early Monday evening and last until Thursday morning.
