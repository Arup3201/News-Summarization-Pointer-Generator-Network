Talk about going out with a bang!

Video captures the moment bomb technicians from Midland Police Department in Texas detonated ten tons of illegal fireworks on Monday afternoon.

The deafening footage  shows a giant plume of smoke sailing into the sky interspersed with flashes of brilliant white and red.

Most of the explosives were reportedly confiscated during last year's Fourth of July festivities.

Consumer fireworks must be stored by a licensed pyrotechnician and labeled properly otherwise they are subject to confiscation.

Russ Morrison, from the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the Midland Reporter-Telegram that the explosive materials are usually stored for months in off-site bunkers before being collectively destroyed.

He added that highly-skilled technicians are put in charge of the job as fireworks can prove fatal.

In the Texas case, the explosives were disposed of in a controlled destruction during the day, because authorities did not want it to be confused for a public fireworks show.

The fiery footage of the discharge was posted on the Midland Police Department Facebook page and has been viewed more than 128,000 times.
