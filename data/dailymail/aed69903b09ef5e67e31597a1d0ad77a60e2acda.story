Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, is accused of killing his wife

Police in Wisconsin say that before she died, a wounded woman called 911 and identified the person who shot her as her brother-in-law, who had been a sheriff's deputy.

A police affidavit obtained Tuesday says Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 around 1 p.m. Friday and said Andy Steele had shot her in the back.

When police arrived at Steele's home in the Madison suburb of Fitchburg they also found the body of his 39-year-old wife, Ashlee Steele, who had also been fatally shot.

The affidavit says the 38-year-old Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota, also told a detective that Andy Steele had shot her before she died at UW hospital.

Steele was arrested but hasn't been charged.

The retired sheriff's deputy had recently diagnosed with ALS and his wife was responsible for raising more than $20,000 to help him battle the disease.

Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy shot and killed the sisters in the couple's Fitchburg, Wisconsin, home.

The Dane County Medical Examiner determined both deaths were homicides.

Fitchburg Police were called to the couple's home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1 p.m. Friday.

According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots.

Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

Members of a sheriff's department SWAT team found Ashlee Steele dead in the home. She had been shot in the head. They found Andrew Steele in a laundry room and a 9 mm pistol on the counter. 

He had not been shot but had non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt.

The affidavit said two rounds had been fired in the house.

According to Twincities.com, no motive has been released for the slayings.

The Steeles have two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband have four children.

Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed.

Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4.

His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses.

The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May.

The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed.

'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said.

It had got so bad, the website said, that the muscle-twitching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food.

As of Saturday, August 23, supporters had raised nearly $23,000 from 266 donations toward the $75,000 goal of the fundraiser, according to Twincities.com.

There were 62 days left to raise the full amount.

Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.'

Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.'

The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael.

Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.'

According to the sisters' obituaries, Kacee Tollefsbol was studying to be a nurse and held a degree in English from the University of St. Thomas. A mother of four, she had just married Mark Tollefsbol a month before she died. Ashlee Steele, a mother of two, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and taught three-year-olds at a church preschool.
