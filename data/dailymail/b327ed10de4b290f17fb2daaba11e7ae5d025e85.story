Police have finally caught the real-life 'Bonnie and Clyde' teenage couple accused of stealing two cars and leading police on a high-speed chase through Colorado

Breanna Gomez, 15, Spencer Linville, 16, and two other teenagers, including 18-year-old Blake Bergeron, were captured Saturday night in New Mexico.

The foursome fled Wisconsin in a stolen car on Tuesday, before outrunning Colorado police in a high-speed pursuit, authorities said.

The car thieves were apprehended in Raton, NM, after a short foot chase, cops told KMGH.

Ms Gomez's worried relatives were relieved she was found safe.

'I’m not proud of what they did or anything else, especially Breanna,' grandmother Judy Carpenter told KMGH.

'I’m just glad she’s safe, and I know that she’s going to have to pay for the things she has done,' she added. 'There’s no excuse'

The grandmother admitted to not knowing the other teens, or even if they were following her granddaughter's lead.

'She’s a very persuasive kid,' the woman lamented.

The group dumped the car in Colorado, before allegedly stealing a light blue Chrysler Town and 
Country minivan, ABC News reported

The teens were believed to be heading to Riverside, California, where Mr Linville's father has a fishing boat.

Authorities had issued an alert for Breanna because she is an insulin-dependent diabetic who may have seizures without her medications.

Ms Gomez's insulin, which she must use five times per day to stay alive, was found in the abandoned vehicle, her grandfather told the Denver Post.

'Her insulin was left [in the car]. If she doesn't have that, she will die,' Jerry Carpenter said.

'We love her and we just want
 her to get treatment,' he added. 'Of course she is going to have 
to pay the price for whatever she's doing. She's responsible for her 
actions, but that does not mean we love her any less.'

The convincing delinquent had just been released from juvenile detention  after a six-month stint for various run-ins with police and cutting classes.

'She's been troubled for a while. We've been trying to help her,' Mr Carpenter told ABC.

'She was supposed to come and see us on Sunday [and] there was even talk of placing her with us.'

The girl, who recently dyed her hair black, was wearing an ankle monitor but did not charge it, according to reports. It stopped transmitting on December 18 or 19, police said.
