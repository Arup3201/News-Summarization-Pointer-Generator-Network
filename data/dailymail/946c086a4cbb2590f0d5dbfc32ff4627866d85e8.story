Shocking: Nidia Alvarado was arrested on suspicion of killing her newborn son and dumping him in the trash told detectives she 'strangled the baby and watched him die'

A Texas woman arrested Tuesday admitted to strangling to death her newborn son, putting his body in a duffel bag and tossing it in a dumpster December 23.

Nidia Alvarado went willingly with police and according to an arrest affidavit told them she 'strangled the baby and watched him die' shortly after giving birth at a hospital under an assumed name.

When asked why she killed the child, whose body was found on a recycling plant conveyer belt, Alvarado answered in Spanish: 'Threats.'

That's according to Chron.com, though no further details of the ominous remark had yet emerged Wednesday night.

Alvarado was taken into custody at her home and charged with capital murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty in Texas.

Alvarado told detectives that several weeks before the birth she had tried to find somebody who would teach her how to perform a self-induced abortion.

She ended up giving birth, however. Police say she used an assumed name at an area hospital.

She also told investigators that after killing the baby, she threw the body into a dumpster at her apartment building inside a duffel bag provided to her by the hospital.

When employees of the Waste Management center on San Antonio's east side found the body, believed to have been no older than 10 days when he died, they immediately ceased all operations.

Disgusting: Alvarado was arrested late Tuesday when she admitted to police that she tossed her baby in a dumpster

The baby, no older than 10 days, eventually ended up at this San Antonio Waste Management plant

A Waste Management spokeswoman said the company provided police with records of the locations where its trucks had picked up the load of recyclables in which the body was found.

Police Sergeant Javier Salazar told reporters it was through 'good detective work' and eyewitness tips that police were able to track down Alvarado.

He also revealed that Alvarado was found living with other children at the time of her arrest.

'There were other children involved in the case that resided in the same place where the suspect resides,' he said.

It remained unclear Wednesday evening if those children belonged to Alvarado.

The children have been handed over to Child Protective Services while police try to find out if Alvarado is their mother.

Under Texas law, a child under 60 days can be left in the care of an official employee at designated safe places, such as hospitals, fire houses or police stations.

A person who drops off an unharmed infant will not be prosecuted for neglect or abandonment under the 'Baby Moses Law,' named for the biblical figure.

The law is aimed at providing desperate parents with a responsible alternative and protects them from criminal prosecution.
