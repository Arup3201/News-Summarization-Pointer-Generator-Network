The second day of February will be declared 'Chris Kyle Day' in the state of Texas, the governor announced Friday. 

Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Friday
he would officially declare Feb. 2 'Chris Kyle Day' in the
state, in honor of the late Navy Seal sharpshooter portrayed in
the film 'American Sniper.'

The movie, starring Bradley Cooper as Kyle who was killed by
a disgruntled U.S. veteran on a Texas gun range in 2013, has
been a box office hit as well as a flashpoint of debate between
liberals and conservatives.

Abbott, a Republican, made the announcement during a speech
at the Texans Veterans of Foreign Affairs Mid-Winter Convention
in Austin, according to a statement from the governor's office.

'In honor of a Texas son, a Navy SEAL and an American hero -
a man who defended his brothers and sisters in arms on and off
the battlefield - I am declaring February 2nd Chris Kyle Day in
Texas,' Abbott said during the speech, according to the
statement.

The film has been nominated for six Academy Awards,
including best picture. It led a Reuters/IPSOS poll of roughly
2,400 Americans who were asked which film should win the top
Oscar.

At the same time, critics have said the film glorifies war 
and sanitizes Kyle, who called Muslims 'savages' in his memoir.

An Arab-American civil rights organization also asked
director Clint Eastwood and actor Bradley Cooper to denounce
hateful language directed at U.S. Arabs and Muslims after the
release of the film.

'It is our opinion that you could play a significant role in
assisting us in alleviating the danger we are facing,' said the
letter penned by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee.

Duty: Abbott called Kyle an American hero and said it is his duty to 'honor those whose sacrifice has preserved our freedom'

The ADC said it was working with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and police to assess the threats.

Jack Horner, a spokesman for Warner Bros., the studio
releasing the film, said in a statement that the company, a unit
of Time Warner Co, 'denounces any violent, anti-Muslim
rhetoric, including that which has been attributed to viewers'
of the film.
