After the hard-fought, violent and costly eviction of the Dale Farm illegal traveller camp, some may have thought the decade-long saga had finally reached an end.

But as these pictures reveal, the battleground has merely moved a few yards away.

They show that since Dale Farm was cleared in October at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £18million, there has been an extraordinary explosion in the number of caravans pitched on the legal Oak Lane site next door.

Taken over: The Dale Farm site, three months after its eviction, shows that while the illegal half on the right has been cleared, the number of caravans on the legal half next door has now swollen

Eyesore: A picture taken on November 8, around three weeks after the original eviction shows how relatively quiet the legal half of the site was before travellers descended on it in recent weeks

Many are from the 90 that were removed from Dale Farm, in Crays Hill, Essex.

Most of the travellers are thought to have relatives on the Oak Lane 
site and began to return in the run-up to Christmas. The overcrowding is
so bad that it breaches planning permission, and Basildon Council is 
preparing to serve eviction notices on half of the site’s 34 pitches by 
the end of January.

Notices are also set to be served on travellers parked on a private road
approaching the site and surrounding streets for breach of regulation.

Staying put: Basildon Council revealed that many of the illegally parked caravans at Dale Farm belong to families who were evicted from the other half of the site last year

Over capacity: Of the 34 caravan pitches on the legal side of Dale Farm, around 50 per cent are said to be breaching planning conditions

Remnants: Doormats, mattresses and other discarded household items litter the road on the now empty side of Dale Farm

The notices would give the travellers 28 days to vacate the land.

In an all-too-familiar echo of the battle for Dale Farm, the travellers 
say they are determined to fight any council moves to evict them.

One, who would give her name only as Kathleen, said: ‘We are going nowhere. When they serve the notices we will ignore them.

‘People are ready to fight for their homes again. It will be like 
another Dale Farm situation all over again.’ Kathleen, 23, added: ‘They 
may send in the police and the bailiffs but we will stay here.’

Len Gridley, who lives near the site, said: ‘I counted about 56 mobile 
touring vehicles on the road leading to Dale Farm and crowded on to the 
Oak Lane site.

‘But a lot of the people we see nowadays are new travellers who have turned up and not those who were there before.’

A total of 43 people were arrested and several injured after Dale Farm 
protesters fought running battles with riot police in October in the 
eviction of about 80 families from what was the UK’s largest illegal 
traveller settlement.

A decade-long legal battle was declared a success and Basildon Council 
announced that the six-acre site, which was built illegally on green 
belt land, was clear.

Council leader Tony Ball said of the latest developments: ‘It’s a 
disappointment and a frustration but not completely unexpected that this
has happened. The fact that the law is now being broken means we will 
move in to enforce it.’

But campaigner Mary Anne McCarthy, who lived on the Dale Farm site for 
ten years, said: ‘There will be another Dale Farm stand-off, there is no
doubt about it. The travellers have nowhere else to go and this is 
their home. They will fight for their homes and livelihood.

‘Tony Ball will have to try and evict us all over again. And that will cost too much.’
