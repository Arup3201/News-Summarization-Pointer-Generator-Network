A large swath of the U.S. is on storm alert as downpours, strong winds and hail hammer several states from Illinois to Texas.

With predictions of flooding on roads and hail the size of golf balls, motorists have been warned to be careful and, if possible, to just leave their cars in a garage.

Texas has already experienced part of the deluge, when winds and rain damaged buildings and roads in Dallas on Thursday.

Wash out: A severe storm warning is in place across a wide stretch of the U.S. for Friday

Fierce: Dallas has already felt the full force of the weather front, with trees being uprooted and buildings damaged on Thursday

On Friday, the storm is anticipated to be at its worst from late morning to early afternoon, before becoming more severe as it moves over the Great Plains at the weekend.

In all, the wet and wild spring weather is forecast to affect about 14 million people over the coming days.

The Weather Channel's Michael Palmer warned those planning to drive in the next few days to use extra caution.

'If
 you can leave your car in the garage that would be preferable,' he told NBC News.

'We are 
going to see isolated storms with high winds and golf ball-sized hail 
from Texas, up through Arkansas and the Mississippi Valley and into 
Illinois and Indiana,' Palmer added.

'Heavy
 downpours could cause water build-up on the roads and at the least 
people need to slow down on their journeys throughout most of [Friday].'

Fatal: Police stand next to a wrecked car on Thursday. A 19-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the vehicle, died when it crashed into a tree at about 9pm

Residents in Dallas have already felt the brunt of the storm, with 4in of rain falling and about 10,000 customers left without power after trees were blown on to lines.

Flash flooding also led to the dramatic rescue of five boys who had skipped school and gathered in a drainage tunnel as the storm hit.

The youngsters, aged 12 and 13, were forced to cling on to whatever they could as the sudden force of water threatened to wash them away.

It took firefighters using specialized swift water equipment about two hours to rescue the terrified youngsters, who were taken to a nearby hospital.

A 19-year-old woman was killed during the storms after the car she was in crashed into a tree at about 9pm. The 30-year-old driver was seriously injured in the crash.

Dallas County, prompting residents to run for cover as high winds 
whipped up debris and knocked out power.

'You just heard this noise [like a train whistle] then it just shook the house. I ran in the bathroom and got in the bathtub,' one resident told CNN.

Three tornadoes formed in Minnesota, and two in Colorado, and meteorologists have warned that more are expected in Texas and Oklahoma over the weekend.
