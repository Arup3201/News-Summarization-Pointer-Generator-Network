Victorino Chua (pictured) is accused of murdering three patients by tampering with their saline drips

The first victim of a hospital poisoning campaign allegedly launched by a nurse told a court: ‘I thought I was going to pop my clogs.’

Pensioner Josephine Walsh was waiting to be discharged when she suffered a sudden hypoglycaemic attack.

She told the jury that she was sitting in a chair waiting to leave ward A3 at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in June 2011 when she passed out.

In a video interview played to the jury, she said: ‘I told the nurse I did not feel well at all.

‘The perspiration was dripping off me. I was absolutely soaking my pyjamas.

‘The next thing I knew, I woke up and I was looking at the ceiling. I thought I was on the way out, I thought I was going to pop my clogs.

‘Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. I had never passed out or gone dizzy.

‘It was just scary. I thought I was going to die. I know that sounds silly but I did. It was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. I had never felt dizzy in my life.’

Victorino Chua, 49, a Filipino-born nurse and father-of-two, is accused of murdering three patients by tampering with their saline drips.

Manchester Crown Court heard Mrs Walsh, now 72, was treated with dextrose after a nurse raised the alarm and doctors referred her to a diabetes specialist.

The specialist carried out tests and confirmed the pensioner did not suffer from the condition and there was no medical reason for the hypoglycaemic attack.

Chua denies more than 30 charges including the murder of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, who never recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin. The prosecution alleges that Chua became the prime suspect after maliciously altering patients’ prescription charts six months later in January 2012.

It was an attempt to trick colleagues into giving them potentially fatal doses, it claims.

Mrs Walsh was the first of 21 victims to suffer hypoglycaemic attacks after Chua laced saline drips and ampoules with insulin, causing falling blood sugar levels, the prosecution said.

The court previously heard Chua also left another patient brain damaged by secretly injecting insulin into drips, turning them into ‘ticking timebombs’ to be used by unwitting colleagues.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said 18 patients who were affected managed to recover after prompt medical intervention by staff.

Mr Wright said Chua’s motive was hard to determine, adding that ‘only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct’.

He said the nurse had ‘turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others, to harming them’.

The defence claims Chua has been ‘made the scapegoat who has had to carry the can’ for the contaminated drips and ampoules. It says the evidence is circumstantial.

The trial, which is expected to last up to four months, continues.
