A mother pony bravely protected her two-week-old foal during a Texas fire - and suffered severe burns in the process.

Bella was found by firefighters in Alvarado shielding young Butterscotch from an April 6 barn fire that killed chickens and sheep, WFAA reports.

'She actually kind of backed the baby into the corner and stood over her and shielded her from the fire and the debris that was falling,' Whitney Hanson of the Humane Society of North Texas told the station.

Butterscotch suffered minor burns, but over half of Bella's body was burned, she said, and was also hurt by falling debris.

'The only reason she survived and pulled through this is because she loves that baby so much, and she wants to be here for the baby,' she said.

Bella's family gave her to the Humane Society of North Texas when they realized they should no longer care for here, the shelter's website says. She was taken along with Butterscotch to an equine specialist.

Bella and Buttserscotch are currently at a Decatur equine clinic receiving twice-daily disinfectant treatments and taking medicine, WFAA says.

Though the shelter met its initial goal of $4,000, it is still asking for donations to help pay for Bella's medical care, as she is reportedly battling early signs of a skin infection and may also require both ear surgery and lifelong care for her ears.
