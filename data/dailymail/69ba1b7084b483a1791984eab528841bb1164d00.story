Those looking for a unique Christmas gift or an adorable way to immortalise their pets can now have an exact replica of their companion sculpted in felt.

For the ultimate animal lover, a pet’s actual fur can be incorporated into the miniature to make it even more convincing.

The models are the work of artist GourmetFelted whose work is for sale on the online shopping site etsy.com.

This model is made of wool, wire, custom colored and sculpted nose and costs £157.10

Small cats and dogs are the most commonly requested, but GourmetFelted can make any animal or size

As well as pet replicas, the artist behind Gourmet Felted, Gerry, from Massachusetts, USA, makes everything from tiny pets for dolls to 
wedding cake decorations.

Made entirely by hand, each inch is felted together from luxury fibres such as angora and  mohair as well as wool, with many hours going into each one.

Gerry says: ‘I've always been most happy expressing myself artistically. When I was a little girl, I even painted seashells...and yes, I did sell them by the seashore!

'My mom taught me how to paint them, and those times were precious.'

This White Cat named Jonah is made of wire, wool, whiskers, eyebrows, cat eyes, luxury fibers and costs £172.81

Unsurprisingly, each piece takes hours to complete, using a need to felt the fibres

‘I have sketched animals as long as I can remember, going through boxes of crayons! I used clay when I was a teen, but I never  thought that I would turn into a sculptor.

‘I put so much love into each one of my creations and I get so much happiness from making these little pets, and also from the joy that it gives others. People have told me that they have tears of happiness when they open the box and see their little replica of their pet.

The model of this Maltese named Stella is made of wool, wire, silk, sculpted clay nose, imported glass eyes, £157.10

On the option to include animal fur along with the wool, Gerry says: I love adding the fur to the sculptures and use lots of luxury fibers like alpaca, silk, down, cashmere, angora, and mohair.

With an individual dog costing around 
£157, and cats at £172 (prices vary according to the amount of effort 
and time taken to create each piece), the models are not cheap, but the 
unique nature of the sculptures means that there is a high demand and 
often a waiting list.

Although small cats and dogs are the most commonly requested sculpture, GourmetFelted can make any animal or size.

She also makes models using vegan fibres for those who are allergic to wool or animal products.

Gerry says: 'They take hours of work, but each is a miracle as an adorable dog emerges from a fluffy pile of wool.’
