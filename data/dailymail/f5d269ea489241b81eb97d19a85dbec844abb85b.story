A summer camp is being sued by a family claiming their 15-year-old daughter was ‘humiliated’ and ‘embarrassed’ after being sent home for kissing a boy.

The girl, from Westport, CT, kissed a 15-year-old boy behind the arts and crafts building July 11 at Camp Emerson, in Massachusetts, with a camp director hurling insults at the girl before both young lovers were expelled, according to reports. It was the night before the girl’s 15th birthday.

The girl’s father was not even allowed on camp grounds when he came to retrieve his heartbroken daughter because she was escorted out by a uniformed, armed police officer, he told 1010 WINS.

Co-ed: Camp Emerson is co-ed, and kissing is not against the rules

‘Kissing, that was all that was going on,’ the father told the radio station.

Prior to being sent home, both teens were allegedly screamed at by a camp director, according to court documents, which stated that they were ‘falsely accused them of sexually provocative behavior including the removal of each other’s clothing,’ before the girl was purportedly called a ‘slut’ and a ‘tramp.’

After deciding the teens would be sent home, the director then told their parents that the girl had undressed and was stricken from the camp she had spent the previous four summers in ‘for the campers’ safety because her acts were dangerous,’ according to the lawsuit.

‘I’m a conservative, strict, prude father, especially when it comes to my daughters, but a kiss in summer camp isn’t something that should result in being booted out of camp,’ the father continued.

Calling the star-crossed lovers’ relationship ‘the summer romance that most teens yearn for, the lawsuit filed Monday said the girl is ‘a child of divorced parents who suffers from anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and treats with a psychiatrist and medications, and who always felt insecure and inferior to her peers, feel confident and beautiful for the very first time in her life.’

The camp does not prohibit kissing, according to the lawsuit. Male counselors even encouraged the boy to kiss her, the suit noted. In the case of a rule being broken, campers are given three strikes before being banished – the girl had never previously received a single strike in her four previous summers at Camp Emerson, the suit said.

Other campers found kissing each other weren’t sent home, the suit alleges. Campers involved in much more serious offenses including being in bed together, bringing condoms to camp, calling the nutritionist fat, brutally insulting or urinating on fellow campers ‘were never kicked out or reprimanded in any other way,’ according to the suit.

Much worse: Camp counselors are alleged in the lawsuit to have been found smoking, drinking and getting high while watching over children as young as eight

Counselors have even been caught smoking, drinking and getting high, but were also never penalized, the suit noted.

The counselors look after children ages eight to 15, according to the camp's website.

On its website, the camp claims that its ‘superior staff’ has a ‘philosophy of respecting the child and the way we see that each child is cared for as an individual.’

A message left for comment with a woman who refused to give her name, instead calling herself ‘just an office worker,’ was not returned by either of the four directors listed online.

The four week session the girl was sent home from cost $6,600, the fee was not refunded. The lawsuit is seeking more than $600,000 in damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation and various other claims. The young girl and her family are not named in the suit due to her age.

A message left with the Hinsdale, MA Police Department seeking comment was also not returned.
