Pedialyte, an electrolyte packed drink for dehydrated babies, may also be a cure for hungover adults.

Regardless of whether or not the drink is an effective cure, Chicago college and graduate students swear by the drink and have begun demanding it at their local stores, The Daily News reported.

Pedialyte is so popular in Chicago that a delivery app called Foxtrot may add Pedialyte to their menu after receiving numerous requests.Â

Pedialyte sales have remained static over the years but recently sales have skyrocketed. Whether or not the drinks popularity is parallel with its use as a hangover remedy is unclear. It sure seems that way, though.

Grid Chicago reported that, figures from market research firm IRI show that Pedialyte sales surged 16% in August compared to the same month in 2012.

Some adults compare Pedialyte to Gatororade but without all the added sugar.

Musician Jason Isbell toll The New York Times Magazine, 'It's like 10 Gatorades in a bottle.'

Whether or not Pedialyte actually works as a hangover cure is still up for debate. A group of Chinese researchers at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou say that sprite is actually the best hangover cure.

Doctors don't see eye to eye with Chicago students. The Daily News reports that Stanley Goldfarb, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, told Slate that Pedialyte wont work to stop a hangover.

'There's nothing you can do to remove the alcohol byproducts,' DR.Perelman said.

'They have to be metabolized by your liver, which takes time. There's no evidence that anything is better than waiting,'he continued.

The drink's website section listed 'Pedialyte to the rescue' says the drink is Pediatricians #1 oral electrolyte solution.

Representatives from Abbot Laboratories who make Pedialyte refuse to comment on the use of the product as a hangover aid.
