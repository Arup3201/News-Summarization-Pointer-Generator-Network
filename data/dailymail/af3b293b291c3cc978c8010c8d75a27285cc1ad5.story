One very unlucky bride, who has already cancelled her wedding once before, may be forced to postpone her nuptials for a second time after losing her engagement ring in a public toilet.

Auckland woman Verena Phillip is appealing to members of the public to help her find her precious rings, which went missing during a photoshoot.

The PhD candidate was due to marry her fiancé last year, but suffered a massive blow when her wedding dress supplier went into liquidation.

After losing her deposit for the dress, the bride-to-be was forced to cancel her big day, leaving her devastated.

However, after months of saving and having set another date for their wedding, the couple face yet another setback after Ms Phillip misplaced the diamond ring.

Ms Phillip, who is now due to marry in January, grazed her knee while posing for a romantic pre-wedding photoshoot with her fiancé at Cornwall Park in the Auckland suburb of Epsom on Sunday October 19.

The student went straight to the park bathrooms to wash out her cut, left the rings on a shelf and walked straight out without them.

The twisted eternity band and matching diamond engagement ring had vanished when she returned to the bathroom 10 minutes later.

The heartbroken youngster immediately reported the incident to the police and has been scouring pawn shops ever since, just in case they are brought in

"It's really sad." Ms Phillip told The New Zealand Herald.

"We had to cancel the photos. I just couldn't do anything. I asked everyone I saw if they had seen anything, but no one had," Ms Phillip said.

Ms Phillip is appealing to any member of the public who may have come across her rings to get in contact with her on pleasehelpfindmyrings@gmail.com.
