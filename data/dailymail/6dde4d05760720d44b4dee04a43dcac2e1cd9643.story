Ross McCormack has completed his move to Fulham after the club agreed an £11million fee with Leeds for the Scottish international.

Leeds released a statement last week saying the striker was not for sale, but Fulham made them an offer that was too good to refuse and the striker has signed a four-year deal at Craven Cottage.

McCormack stayed in England while the rest of the Leeds squad travelled to Italy for a pre-season training camp and handed in a transfer request, and now the 27-year-old has got his move.

McCormack, who has commanded the same transfer fee that took Christian Eriksen from Ajax to Tottenham, was the top scorer in the Championship last season with 28 goals and Fulham boss Felix Magath will be hoping he can have a similarly prolific campaign as the Cottagers look to bounce back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

Norwich were also believed to be keen on the striker, but pulled out of the race to sign the former Cardiff, Motherwell and Rangers man.
