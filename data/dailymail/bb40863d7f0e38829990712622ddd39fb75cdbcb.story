Charged: Qawmane Wilson, 24, pictured, has been charged with murder and home invasion in the September 2012 death of his mother, Yolanda Holmes, 45, who was a well-known owner of a beauty salon

A Chicago man is accused of plotting his mother's murder to get access to $90,000 of savings and her two life insurance policies.

Qawmane Wilson, 24, of North Austin, has been charged with murder and home invasion in the September 2012 death of his mother, Yolanda Holmes, 45, a well-known owner of a beauty salon, whose name is tattooed on his shoulder.

Wilson's friends Eugene Spencer, 22, and Loriana Johnson, 23, are also charged in the slaying.

Prosecutors say Spencer killed Holmes, and Johnson served as Spencer's driver.

On Tuesday, Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois, Jr. called the murder a 'heinous act' and ordered all three suspects held without bail.

Immediately following the hearing, a relative of both Wilson and Holmes collapsed in the hall outside bond court, sobbing, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Holmes was the owner of the Nappy Headz salon in Uptown Chicago.

She was killed at around 4:15 a.m. September 2 at her home in the 1000 block of West Montrose Avenue, authorities said.

She died of multiple stab wounds and a gunshot wound to her head.

Wilson was arrested Sunday after detectives determined he had arranged to 'have his mother murdered,' police told the Tribune.

Assistant State's Attorney Maura White said Wilson was the 'sole beneficiary' of his mother's assets, including two life insurance policies, White said. One week after Holmes' death, Wilson liquidated $90,000 from of his mother’s bank accounts, White said.

Ayonna Anderson, one of Holmes’ friends, told the Chicago Sun-Times Tuesday that she was stunned to learn that Wilson might be involved in his mother's death.

'She gave him everything he wanted,' said Anderson, a hair stylist who worked in Holmes' salon. 'He wasn't hurting for nothing. Why would you have your mother killed?'

Anderson said Holmes was a single mother and that Wilson, as a boy, would often spend time at the salon.

'He was a salon baby,' Anderson said. 'Everybody know him. We would never think he was capable of doing that. She was a great mom.'

Cell phone records revealed that Wilson called Spencer and Johnson 'before, during and after the murder,' White said.

Both Wilson and Spencer admitted their respective roles in the scheme, she said.

Spencer was arrested Monday and is charged with first degree murder, home invasion, and aggravated discharge of a firearm.

Police say Johnson drove Spencer to and from Holmes' house. She was also arrested Monday and charged with murder and home invasion.

According to the Tribune, Holmes was a fixture in the community and often used her salon in the 4100 block of North Broadway as a venue to publicize or host community events like back-to-school parties for young students. Family and friends said she was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

'She had a real nice personality, always trying to help people,' her uncle James Newman told the Chicago Tribune.

Joseph Adibu, who owns the nearby Broadway Super Coin Laundry, said at the time: 'She is a very good person. For that to happen to her is a blow to a lot of us. It's very painful.'

Wilson, Spencer and Johnson will spend Christmas in jail and are next scheduled to appear in court on January 13.
