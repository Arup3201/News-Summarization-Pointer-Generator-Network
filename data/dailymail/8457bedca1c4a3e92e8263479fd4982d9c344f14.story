Jailed: Christopher Holloway, 32, of Raglan, south east Wales, ran a sophisticated website selling legal highs to customers around the world

A drug dealer raked in £2.5million funding a 'lavish lifestyle' which included luxury holidays to Las Vegas by selling legal highs through a website operated from his home.

Christopher Holloway, 32, of Raglan, south east Wales, imported substances before mixing and packaging them for sale as 'research chemicals' - understood by customers to be legal highs.

When police raided his home they seized 8kg of drugs with a street value in excess of £3.5million.

The dealer was also found to have a staggering £1million in his bank account, Newport Crown Court heard. 

The court also heard how he spent five weeks on holiday in Las Vegas - where he blew £25,000 gambling in the city's casinos.

While there, he stayed exclusively at expensive hotels such as the Bellagio and MGM Grand, and would usually hire a Porsche or Lamborghini for the trips so that he could 'arrive in style'.

His complex drug dealing operation was first detected by Border Agency staff in June 2012.

A package from China was intercepted at the Parcel Force depot in Coventry - it was destined for Raglan and labelled 'samples' but contained just under 1kg of a Class B drug.

Police said Holloway was running a sophisticated operation out of his own home and was selling drugs to people across the world. 

When he was arrested, police found evidence of more than 13,000 sales worldwide, including Scotland, Jersey, Tokyo and California.

Online purchases were even being made while the police were searching his home.

Detective Chief Inspector Roger Fortey, of Gwent Police, said drugs seized from Holloway were forensically tested and found to be 'far from safe'.

Many of the substances seized contained Class A, B and C drugs. 

Prolific: His website 'Benzofury' made him up to £2.5million and police found records of more than 13,000 sales

Stash: When police officers raided his home they found drugs with a street value of up to £3.5million along with a haul of materials used to package his products for export

Mr Fortey claimed taking legal highs using the substances seized from Holloway's haul would be like 'playing Russian Roulette with your health'.

He added: 'The phrase 'legal highs' portrays an image of the substances being legal and hence safe. These substances contain dangerous, harmful and untested chemicals.'  

Police closed down Holloway's 'Benzofury' website only for him to create another site to continue selling drugs. This site has also been closed. 

Today, Holloway pleaded guilty to importation of controlled drugs, possession with intent to supply controlled drugs, supplying controlled drugs and money laundering. He was jailed for 10 years.

Sophisticated: As part of Holloway's operation he would import substances before mixing and packaging them for sale as 'research chemicals' - understood by customers to be legal highs

Benzo Fury, the title of Holloway's website, is the name of a former legal high that was banned last year and labelled as a class B substance - following a review from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD).

The move came after the drug was linked to a series of deaths in 2013.

Benzo fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high.

It induces feelings of empathy similar to Class A drug ecstasy and its side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia.
