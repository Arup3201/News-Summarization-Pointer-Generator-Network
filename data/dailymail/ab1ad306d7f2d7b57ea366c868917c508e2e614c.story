The man who followed the man who followed Sir Alex Ferguson was always meant to be the lucky one and on Monday that stroke of good fortune officially went the way of Louis van Gaal.

Appointing Manchester United’s first continental manager has been a protracted process, and one that will not have pleased the Dutch FA so close to the start of the World Cup, but the club feel they have made the right choice this time.

The situation Van Gaal inherits at Old Trafford could not be more different from the one that faced his predecessor 12 months ago.

Values: Van Gaal has a record of bringing through young talent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich

While many feared that the only way for David Moyes was down, in the short term at least, after the glittering success of the Ferguson era, the feeling now is that it cannot possibly get any worse under the new man.

Turning things around will not be easy. Van Gaal must revive a club that tumbled from Premier League title winners to seventh place over the course of a season. The top four and a return to the Champions League has to be his aim.

He must restore the confidence and swagger to a team who became almost frightened of their own shadow and he must get the best out of players who, for one reason or another, let down Moyes so badly.

Some of them will no longer be around when the 62-year-old Dutchman officially takes charge in July. And there is a £200million kitty available to replace them.

Gone: David Moyes (pictured with LMA chief executive Richard Bevan) was sacked by the club in April

Safe pair of hands: Ryan Giggs has been taking care of business at Old Trafford in the interim

United 
couldn’t be sure if Moyes was the man to spend that money but, in Van 
Gaal, they believe they have an established statesman of European 
football; a coach who has been in charge of Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern 
Munich and has the success to show for it. There will be no issues 
convincing the United players of his credentials.

It
 was notable that the talks with United chief Ed Woodward and Ryan Giggs
 last week took place on Van Gaal’s terms, on Van Gaal’s turf in 
Holland. At his penthouse apartment on Queen Astrid  Boulevard in 
Noordwijk, King Louis held court and told his guests what they wanted to
 hear.

‘He
 will have spelt out to United the Van Gaal philosophy,’ said a source 
close to him. ‘Attacking, dominant, pressure football.’

Van Gaal (right) is a big character with a big ego. Some are concerned that it might be too big.Even
 Woodward referred to a ‘larger than life  character’ on Monday and some
 people at the club are already bracing themselves for a bumpy ride.

United suffered through their lack of activity in the transfer market last summer and cannot afford to make the same mistake again. Many of the targets remain the same, but Van Gaal is bound to have plans of his own and they must be hatched around the restrictions of a World Cup.

In charge: Ryan Giggs (left) took charge of a double training session for United's players on Tuesday

Born: August 8, 1951

Age: 62

Place of birth: Amsterdam, Holland

Clubs played for: Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam, AZ Alkmaar

Total appearances: 333

Total goals: 34

Clubs managed: Ajax, Barcelona (two spells), AZ Alkmaar, Bayern Munich

Countries managed: Holland (2000-02 and 2012-present)

Honours as a manager: Eredivisie (1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96, 2008-09), UEFA Cup 1991-92, Champions League 1994-95, UEFA Super Cup (1995 and 1997), La Liga (1997-98 and 1998-99), Copa del Rey (1997-98), Bundesliga 2009-10

Of the 
current United squad, what now for the likes of Ashley Young, Nani and 
Javier Hernandez? Can Van Gaal get the best out of Juan Mata and Shinji 
Kagawa?

Some players could face a very different future now that he has taken over, and none more so than Robin van Persie.

The
 striker never bought into the Moyes project, and it is unlikely that he
 would have stayed around had the Scot survived his first season.

Now
 the Holland captain is being tipped to be Van Gaal’s skipper at United 
as well, although where that leaves Wayne Rooney is an intriguing 
question.

On the move? Winger Ashley Young could find himself out of Van Gaal's plans for next season

Out of favour: Portuguese star Nani struggled for playing time under Moyes last season

Not needed? Van Gaal is hoping to sign Bayern Munich's Mario Mandzukic, which could spell the end of Javier Hernandez's Old Trafford career

FRANS HOEK - Goalkeeping coach - Age 57

One
 of Van Gaal’s longest-serving and most trusted lieutenants, the former 
FC Volendam goalkeeper has worked at Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and 
the Dutch national team, and has overseen the development of the likes 
of Edwin van der Sar, Pepe Reina and Victor Valdes. Hoek has written 
various books on the training methods of goalkeepers.

MARCEL BOUT - Assistant coach - Age 51

Specialises in scouting opposition, Bout has previously held roles at Bayern Munich, Telstar, AZ, FC Volendam and Feyenoord.

Rooney
 almost left United over what he perceived as Ferguson’s favouritism 
towards Van Persie, but the pendulum swung back in his favour under 
Moyes and he was set to inherit the armband from Nemanja Vidic.

Negotiating that particular minefield will be an early test of Van Gaal’s skills.

He has already made a wise move by appointing Giggs as his No 2. Keeping a United icon and someone who knows the club inside out has gone down equally well in the boardroom and the dressing room.

Another issue that will have scored heavily with United bosses is Van Gaal’s commitment to youth.

Does Van Gaal look outside Old Trafford to replace Vidic and Rio Ferdinand or trust in Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and highly rated youngsters like Michael Keane?

Come on in! Marcel Bout, who assisted Van Gaal at Bayern Munich, has also rocked up at Man United

In his 
conversations with Giggs he is known to have asked about the state of 
the club’s academy and the identities of those ready to make an impact 
on the first team.

‘He won’t just go out and buy players,’ said the source. ‘He will look to the academy.

‘If
 two players are of the same quality he will always prefer the younger 
one. They are more adaptable to his style and he’ll convert them into 
top players.’

They were saying equally nice things about David Moyes a year ago, however, and regrettably for him it didn’t work out.

Louis
 van Gaal will not be burdened by being anointed the Chosen One. Maybe 
he really is the Lucky One, the man who followed the man. Only time will
 tell.
