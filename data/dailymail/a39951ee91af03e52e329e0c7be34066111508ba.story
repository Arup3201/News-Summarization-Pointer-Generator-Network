After blowing more than $5 million in his first two seasons in the NFL on things like multiple BMWs and suped-up Dodge Chargers, New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie has turned over a new leaf - he's traded the fancy Beemers for a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius and has recommitted himself to financial discipline.

In an interview withÂ Newsday, Cromartie tells reporter Bob Glauber that his days of reckless spending have come to an end and that he is 'all about saving money.'

'I was out of control,' Cromartie said. 'I remember [former Chargers teammate] Quentin Jammer used to tell me to slow down, but I couldn't do it. I just loved spending money.'

For example, at one point, Cromartie had 'nine cars, two expensive homes, piles of jewelry, [gave] extravagant gifts and cash -- lots of cash -- to friends and family members who would simply ask, and shopping sprees that ran into the tens of thousands of dollars. Cromartie spent so much on so many things and so many people he can't even remember where it all went.'

Of the cars - which included two Dodge Chargers, two BMWs, two Cadilacs and a 1965 Caprice - Cromartie says he spent upwards of $100,000 just to fix them up.

Cromartie - who is the middle of a four-year, $32 million contract with the Jets - has now recruited the help of a financial adviser, who credits the transformation to showing the 29-year-old athlete what it's like to have a 'settled' home life.

'I can tell a lot of things to a lot of clients, but that doesn't mean they'll listen and accept what I say and practice that discipline,' Cromartie's adviser Jonathan Schwartz said. '[Cromartie] buys into it. He knows that a professional athlete's earning period is limited, and that the best form of accumulating wealth is not to spend. His peers will go buy Rolls Royces and Ferraris and diamond jewelry, but 25 years from now, Antonio can still maintain his lifestyle, sit at the beach enjoying a cocktail and say, "I've earned it.'"

Cromartie, who has 12 children with eight different women in six different states, says he wants to be a role-model for younger players who might be tempted to make the same mistakes he made as a young athlete with a lot of money.

'I tell the young guys, "'Don't spend any money the first year and a half of your career,'" Cromartie said. 'You don't know what will happen after that. You might be released. You might be hurt. Just save your money.'
