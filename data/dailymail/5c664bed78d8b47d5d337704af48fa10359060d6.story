It is every Star Wars fan's dream - a working lightsaber that can destroy enemies in its path.

One US fan has even built his own using a high powered laser to make a replica capable of cutting through household objects.

A YouTube video shows the invention cutting through paper, tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball.

The laser can output over 3000mW according to its creator, who named in 'The Beast'

The YouTube user who created the gadget has refused to reveal his identity- but claims the laser is legal in the US, where is is believed to be from.

'Here my BEAST 3000mW blue laser goes up against a bunch of flammable stuff,' he says.

'Most things light INSTANTLY when placed in the beam of this laser!

'This is the most powerful handheld laser that I've ever used!'

'This laser uses the new 9mm 450nm 
laser diode and runs on two 18650 Li Ion batteries,' said YouTube user styropyro, who calls himself 'The DIY Laser Guy'.

The DIY lightsaber is based on the iconic weapons used in the Star wars films

He has posted several videos of previous project to the video site, but said none were as close to the Star wars weapon as this version.

'I usually try to refrain from using the 
term 'lightsaber' when referring to my lasers but there really isn't 
much else out there to describe this laser.

'To be honest I don't 
even like handheld lasers this strong, but I knew by subscribers would 
like this! This laser is legal to own in the US, and I wore goggles 
while shooting this video.'

However, the commenters on the video has pointed out one fatal flaw with the device.

'This isï»¿ all well and good, but you didn't test it against a dark lord of the Sith,' one said.

The homemade gadget is capable of cutting through paper (and setting fire to it in the process)

A piece of cardboard is also neatly cut through

The lighsaber is also shown cutting through and setting fire to a roll of electrical tape
