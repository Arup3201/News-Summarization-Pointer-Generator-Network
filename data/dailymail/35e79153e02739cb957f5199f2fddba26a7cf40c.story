A Colorado nursing student was arrested yesterday after telling his therapist of his desire to shoot children, kill people on Halloween and assassinate President Obama, court records show.

Mitchell Kenneth Kusick, 20, of Westminster, was being held on suspicion of a federal charge of threats against a president. 

He identified himself as a student at Colorado Mesa University in western Colorado, investigators said.

Murderous intent? Mitchell Kenneth Kusick, a nursing student from Westminster, Colorado, was charged with making a threat against the president

Plot: Court papers say Kusick wanted to be known as 'the guy who killed President Obama,' pictured on Sunday at a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery

According to KUSA-TV in Denver, Jefferson County court records show he told his therapist about wanting to shoot children at a trick-or-treat event at Standley Lake High School.

Federal court records say Kusick said he took a shotgun from his aunt's house and tried to buy ammunition.

Is a doctor sworn to secrecy when a patient plans to commit a crime? It’s up to the doctor.

Doctors can sever the physician-patient confidentiality if they become concerned, as the doctor of Mitchell Kusick did.

The American Medical Association admits that its code of ethics are not bound by law.

The issue was brought in another Colorado case, when Aurora theater gunman James Holmes's doctor went to police because she had become concerned about her patient.

However, she did not give his name, citing doctor-patient confidentiality.

The court will decide whether to allow a notebook believed to detail Holmes' plans, which he mailed to the psychiatrist, Dr Lynn Fenton, before the shooting.

For members of the clergy, there is priest-penitent privilege in which a priest is bound by secrecy during church confessions, but there have been exceptions in court.

The documents said that he claimed to
 have owned a .22 caliber rifle and an assault rifle, but his parents 
made him get rid of the weapons.

He
 told his therapist on October 29 about his plan and allegedly said he 
wanted to go down in history as the 'guy who killed Obama.'

His comments came just days before the president held a campaign rally in Boulder.

Kusick
 also said he was obsessed with the deadly shootings at Columbine High 
School and Virginia Tech, as well as the Dark Knight Rises theater 
massacre earlier this year, according to court records.

Among Kusick’s interests on his Facebook
 page are 'American conspiracies,' the Call of Duty video games and the film
 Paul Blart: Mall Cop.

The same document quoted Kusick of saying: 'Some people just want to watch the world burn down, and I’m one of them.'

The therapist notified police, and Kusick was placed on a mental health hold at a hospital.

A detention hearing is scheduled Friday.

Violent interests: Kusick's therapist said he was obsessed with the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings, and the Aurora theater massacre, in which James Holmes, pictured, was charged with killing 12
