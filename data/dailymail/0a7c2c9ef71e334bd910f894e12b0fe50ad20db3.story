A dead man was found in the bathroom of a Greyhound bus at a Dallas maintenance facility on Wednesday, the company said.

Maintenance workers noticed the bathroom door was locked, wedged it open and discovered the body inside, according to spokeswoman Lanesha Gipson.

There were no reports of disturbances prior to the body being found, she said.

The maintenance facility is located on Continental Avenue's 300 Block, NBC DFW reported.

The bus departed from Los Angeles and made stops in El Paso, Abilene and Fort Worth before arriving in Dallas, Gipson said.

'We’re doing an investigation to determine what happened,' Gipson told CBS DFW.

No signs of foul play were found, police told the affiliate station.

CBS DFW reported that the Dallas County Medical Scene went to the maintenance facility site.

Dallas Police were not immediately available for comment.

The identity of the man and cause of death are unknown.
