Just days after rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby resurfaced, and one woman bravely shared her story, the comedian has gotten the boot from one of America's most popular talk shows.

It is being reported that Queen Latifah has decided to scrap an interview she had planned with Cosby for next Monday.

Production sources told TMZ that the higher ups at The Queen Latifah Show did not want to be 'associated' with Cosby in the wake of these stories.

But in an official statement released Thursday, The Queen Latifah Show denied the claims.

'Mr. Cosby¹s scheduled appearance on The Queen Latifah Show was postponed at his request and was in no way related to any of our recent or upcoming scheduled guests.'

Cosby's history of rape and sexual assault, which he has never been charged with in a court of law, became a major topic last week when comedian Hannibal Burress brought it up during one of his stage shows. 

In fact, one woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward and shared her story with MailOnline earlier this week.

'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she revealed. 

'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels.

Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too.

After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her.

Hours after Bowman came forward with her story on Monday, Cosby cancelled a scheduled live performance in Florence, Arizona.

Telling her story: Just this week, Barbara Bowman (above) detailed how Cosby raped and drugged her' while she was just a teenager 

In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004.

It was at that trial that 13 women came forward to allege they too were drugged and sexually abused by Cosby.  

Cosby has not commented on any of the allegations since they resurfaced. 

A rep for The Queen Latifah Show said in a statement, 'Mr. Cosby’s scheduled appearance on The Queen Latifah Show was postponed at his request and was in no way related to any of our recent or upcoming scheduled guests.'
