In life, he was proud of always putting on a good show.

In death, Sir Jimmy Savile’s gravestone keeps up the tradition.

It bears his chosen epitaph – ‘It was good while it lasted’ – along with a poem about his life, a first-person inscription, two images of Sir Jimmy and an unexpected gaffe.

Unveiled: Sir Jimmy's headstone has just been unveiled as the land had to settle after he was buried

Julie Ferguson penned the verse

The engraver made a spelling mistake 
in writing the word ‘chieftan’ in gold script and no one spotted the 
missing letter ‘i’ until after yesterday’s dedication ceremony.

Funeral director Robert Morphet  
promised: ‘It will be put right – whatever it takes.’ But everyone could
 imagine Sir Jimmy, cigar in hand, chuckling from  the heavens.

The DJ, TV presenter and tireless  charity fundraiser died last October aged 84 at his home in Leeds. 

He was buried the following month at 
Woodlands Cemetery in his favourite resort of Scarborough – with the 
gold  coffin at a 45-degree angle so he could ‘see’ the sea in the 
distance.

Also visible from the site is the medieval Scarborough Castle.

There was a delay in installing  the 
6ft-wide, 4ft-high granite gravestone because the ground was apparently 
not firm enough to take its weight.

A further hold-up was caused because
 of a now-discredited claim by a woman from Staffordshire to be Sir 
Jimmy’s daughter – which delayed the inscription in case he needed to be
 referred to as a father.

Sir Jimmy Savile’s larger than life triple headstone was unveiled with a spelling mistake etched in granite on the memorial.

The 6ft wide grave reads 'Chieftan of Lochaber Highland Games' in 18mm gold letters when it should read 'Chieftain'.

Funeral
 Director Robert Morphet could not understand how the mistake had 
happened but said: 'It will be put right – whatever it takes.'

But yesterday, friends and family 
finally gathered for the dedication and blessing ceremony at the site 
where Sir Jimmy was buried in his trademark tracksuit. 

It was decided to incorporate the two
 adjoining plots into the memorial because so many fans are expected to 
visit.

Charities supported by Sir Jimmy are listed on the gravestone, 
along with a verse by his friend Julie Ferguson, an amateur poet with 
whom he often used to stay in the Hebrides.

It details his life story from working as a miner to presenting Top Of The Pops, marathon-running and becoming a knight.

She also wrote the inscription on the back, beginning: ‘I, Sir Jimmy Savile, do lie beneath this stone.

Gathering: Following the service, the attendees made their way up to Esplanade for the unveiling of a gilt plaque 
at Wessex Court, where Sir Jim, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had his 
Scarborough residence

Touching: The
 headstone has been inscribed with verse written by Julie Ferguson,
 a good friend of Sir Jim’s

Comedian Spike Milligan’s famous epitaph has been named the nation’s favourite and it reads: 'I told you I was ill'.

Oscar Wilde’s grave is engraved with the words ‘Either those curtains go or I do’

Frank Sinatra’s ‘The best is yet to come’ is also a well known epitaph.

Comic Frank Carson's epitaph raises a smile as it reads ‘What a way to lose weight’.

Wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill has: ‘I am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter', engraved on his tomb.

‘From here I view North &  South Bay and the place that was my home.’

Sir Jimmy’s nephew Roger Foster, 67, 
said: ‘His legacy will be long-lasting. The Jimmy Savile charity trust 
will soon start giving money to good causes.

‘The headstone will become a tourist 
attraction. Dozens of  people have already been coming to look for the 
grave even though there was no headstone.

‘He was just an ordinary bloke from the back streets of Leeds but everyone loved him and wants to pay their respects.

‘I dare say soon there will be an ice cream stall and someone selling Jim’ll Fix It badges.’
  Shortly before his death, Sir Jimmy informed close friend Howard Silverman of the epitaph he wanted.

Mr Silverman said: ‘It says 
everything. He had the fortune and fame and made the fame work for the 
charities he raised £45million for – but he knew  nothing lasts for 
ever.’

 flat will now be sold and the proceeds given to a charitable foundation

Sir Jimmy – James Wilson Savile – was born in Leeds on Halloween 1926.

He left school at 14 and when war broke out he enlisted as a coal miner for the war effort.

An underground explosion damaged his spine so badly that he had to give up mining.

Instead he became a local entertainer, organising what he described as Britain’s first disco in 1948.

His work in the dance-halls was eventually spotted and he was asked to move on to radio where he rapidly acquired national fame, first with Radio Luxembourg and then BBC Radio 1.

He later competed as a semi-professional sportsman, taking part in the 1951 Tour of Britain cycle race and a professional wrestler.

He fought 107 bouts but won just seven, insisting it was never fixed.

In 1964, Sir Jimmy presented the very first edition of Top Of The Pops.

In the 70s, he started a 20-year run as host of Jim'll Fix It, working miracles for more than 1,500 children.

He raised staggering amounts for charity - his accountant lost track after £40million.
