Australia chef Matt Moran has officially been confirmed as the owner of the first major food venue at Sydney's new Barangaroo development.

The celebrity chef will open a dramatic three-level establishment in the exclusive harbourside spot after securing a 10-year lease.

The announcement was made on Monday by Barangaroo developers Lend Lease and is a joint venture between Moran, his business partner Peter Sullivan from MorSul, and Bruce Solomon and Anna Solomon from Solotel.

On Monday morning it was announced celebrity chef Matt Moran will open a three-level venue at Barangaroo

The eatery will resemble three bowls stacked on top of each other with each level providing a different experience

The outside of the restaurant has been designed to resemble three bowls stacked on top of each other. It was designed by Sydney architects Collins and Turner, who have also created a number of bars for craft beer company James Squire.

'It's a big move for us, it's a big space,' Moran told Good Food. 'It's three concepts in one building so it is one of the biggest things I've ever done,' he continued.

On the first level of the venue will be a relaxed eatery, on the second a restaurant and the top floor will boast a spectacular rooftop garden bar.

The chef's portfolio already includes restaurants such as Aria, Chiswick, North Bondi Fish and Opera Bar

Spanning a huge 1500 square metres, the establishment - which is yet to be names - will have an Australian concept with a local wine list.

The restaurant will open in March 2016 and construction has already begun on the venue, which will be just one of more than 50 restaurants, cafes and bars set to pop up as part of the development.

Moran's current portfolio includes Aria - a hatted restaurant which overlooks Sydney Harbour - and the nearby Opera Bar, which he just signed a renewed 10-year lease on.

Moran and Sullivan's new venture - which is yet be to named - will open at Barangaroo in March 2016

Chiswick in Woollahra - which grows much of its own produce - and North Bondi Fish are also run by Moran and Sullivan.

However the latest venture will provide a different dining experience to all the other venues and is part of the wider $6 billion project at Barangaroo.

Moran has been a guest chef on Channel 10's Masterchef program for many years, and now stars in his own show Paddock to Plate which recently kicked off its second season.
