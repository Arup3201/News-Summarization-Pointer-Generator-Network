Follow live coverage of the Europa League quarter-final draw from UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.

Everton may have been the last Premier League club to bow out but a strong field remains, all hoping to reach the Warsaw final on May 27.

Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Napoli, Sevilla, Wolfsburg, Zenit St Petersburg, Club Brugge and Dnipro are the teams in the pot.

Follow the draw live from 12pm.

The draw in full for you then: 

Sevilla vs Zenit St Petersburg

Dnipro vs Club Brugge

Dynamo Kiev vs Fiorentina

Wolfsburg vs Napoli

The first legs will be played on April 16 with the second legs seven days later on April 23

The Russians will take on the defending champions, Sevilla

Because of the complication regarding Russian and Ukrainian teams, who can't be drawn against each other, the ball with Zenit in it has been separated and will be drawn first. 

The special guest today is the former Liverpool and Poland goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, who is the ambassador for the Warsaw final this year. 

Gianni Infantino is back on the stage, even receiving a round of applause as he walked in. 

The only teams that will be kept apart are those from Russia and Ukraine because of the conflict there. That means Zenit will not be paired with Dynamo Kiev or Dnipro. 

The Europa League theme tune is playing so we shouldn't be too far away from the main draw now. 

A reminder that this season's Europa League final will be held in Warsaw, Poland on May 27. 

The total wipeout of English clubs from European competition this week has led to another feverish debate about where our game stands in relation to our continental counterparts.

But before we get too down about things, there is still one Englishman standing in Europe this season.

Manchester City may have crashed out to Barcelona but their on-loan defender Micah Richards is still eyeing European glory with Italian side Fiorentina.
