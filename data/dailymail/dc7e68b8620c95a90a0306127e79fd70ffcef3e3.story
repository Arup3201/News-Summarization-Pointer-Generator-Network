Sitting amid the dirt and dust, this forest of pine trees makes for a strangely spectacular sight set against the barren landscape of the Australian Outback.

However, on closer inspection, there's something nostalgic and familiar about this shrubbery.

This is the life-sized Lego forest 
that was built in the Australian Outback to commemorate 50 years of the 
iconic brick Down Under.

Plastic pop-up: To celebrate 50 years of the iconic brick Down Under, life-sized versions of the pine trees and flower sets sprung up in the Australian Outback

At four metres high, the 15 pine trees are accompanied by 15 flower bed sets, their bright colours contrasting starkly with the surrounding arid and dusty brown landscape.

The impressive scaled-up versions of the original pieces are 66 
times bigger than their normal Lego counterparts - and are exact replicas of the much-loved toys.

The forest is now located more than 700 miles west of Sydney to a nature reserve in Broken Hill - the location where the first three Mad Max movies were made.

It will remain there until July 12. It forms part of Lego's Festival of Play celebrations to mark half-a-century of the Lego brick in Australia.
