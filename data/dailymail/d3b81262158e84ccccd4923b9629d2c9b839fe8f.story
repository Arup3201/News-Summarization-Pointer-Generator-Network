A couple who named their fish and chip shop after their pet dog have been ordered to change the title - or face a million-pound law suit from a major Hollywood studio.

John McNeill and partner Andrea Smith were stunned when lawyers told them they had to stop calling their busy chippie Scooby Snax because it breached copyright rules.

The powerful film company Hanna Barbera -  who made the children's cartoon Scooby Doo - claim they own all rights to the name.

Fearing a legal battle that could bankrupt them, the pair will now have to scrap the popular chippie's sign-written name board, uniforms, advertising and even menus and order pads.

The award-winning take-away and restaurant in the small riverside town of Brightlingsea, Essex, has been trading for more than eight years as 'Scooby Snax'.

It was the fourth shop they had run and they decided to call it Scooby Snax in memory of the family's Lhaso Apso Scooby, which died at the age of two.

But the David and Goliath confrontation started when Mr McNeill  began the process of trade-marking the name to protect his business.

Heavyweight lawyers acting for Hanna Barbera in the film capital Burbank, Los Angeles swooped ordering the shocked couple to stop trading immediately.

'I was stunned when I opened their letter - I just couldn't believe that a multi-million pound international film company should bullying us like this.' said Mr McNeill, 51.

'They said we couldn't use the name or anything that looked like, sounded like or in any way resembled the name.

'I have had to spend £20,000 on changing everything that has the name Scooby on it - we can't even use our menus.'

The undertaking Mr McNeill says he was forced to sign included the promise to 'destroy and obliterate any signage, marketing material, leaflets and headed notepaper or any other materials carrying the name Scooby Snax.

Mr McNeill, who went into the trade 17 years ago after leaving the RAF, said: 'My advice was that if the Americans sued me in the High Court for copyright infringement, I could face a legal bill of more than £100,000.

'I can't afford to fight them and I can't risk losing the roof over our heads.

'I have worked hard to build up this business - we have been area winners of the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year competition for three years in a row.

'We employ 13 staff here and sponsor local soccer, darts and cricket teams and back the Scouts.

'My customers are dismayed and they can't understand why we are being pursued like this - their company probably employs more people than live in Brightlingsea.'

The entertainment giants Hanna Barbera, which became part of Warner Brothers, owns all rights to a host of cartoon characters including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, the Flintstones - and Scooby Doo.

Mr McNeill's legal advisers have told him he had a good case and accused the studio of bullying.

But then the Americans sent them five large boxes of paperwork to support their claim and Mr McNeill's legal bill began to mount.

'We knew we could prove we had been trading before they registered the trademark in Europe - we had bills, contracts and photographs to prove it,' he said.

'But the evidence they sent ran to 16,000 sheets of paper and it would have cost us £2,000 just to photocopy all the documents.

'We just couldn't believe that a massive company in the USA was trying to crush a chip shop in a tiny Essex village.

'Our specialist copyright advisors said big companies acted aggressively because they know that small independent businesses like us just can't afford to fight them.'

Mr McNeill and Ms Smith, 41, were warned that fighting the case could cost them at least £25,000 so reluctantly they have decided it was better to give in.

'We have had to order new signs, new menus and paperwork and have new branded uniforms,' said Mr McNeill, whose shop is now going to be re-named 'Johnny Mac's Plaice..

'And we're going to trademark our new name - just to be safe,' he added.

A spokesman for Warner Bros said: 'We initially made contact with Mr McNeill through standard traded, mark procedures.

'We subsequently entered into an agreement which protects the valuable intellectual property right of Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc as well as the creativity of those who created the much-loved and famous Scooby-Doo character and Scooby Snacks mark'.
