Ellie Topliff turns two in February and sadly it will probably be her last birthday.

The tiny tot is one of only two Australians known to have Tay Sachs disease, a genetic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme that breaks down fatty substances in the brain.

As a result of the missing protein, fat builds up in the brain leading to blindness, hearing loss, seizures, paralysis and eventually death.

The tragic news is that there is no treatment and a cure is yet to be found.

Despite her ongoing battle with Tay Sachs disease, Ellie Topliff (pictured) continues to smile

Ellie's mum Catherine (pictured left) says she and her husband Joel (pictured right) began to see signs of a problem when Ellie (pictured middle) was about seven-months-old

Between 1995 and 2011 there were 12 recorded cases of Tay Sachs in Australia.

That means one child in every 353,935 is born with the condition.

The disease is usually diagnosed when a baby is six-months-old, when development slows then regresses as fatty substances begin to envelop the brain.

Ellie's mum Catherine says she and her husband Joel began to see signs of a problem when Ellie was about seven-months-old.

'Ellie was always the fastest to develop from early on. There was a group of six of us who had babies about 10 days apart and she would always succeed in her milestones before them,' she told AAP.

'Around seven or eight months she stopped rolling, so I said `okay she is getting ready to crawl' but then she never did.'

'And then we were waiting and waiting and waiting.'

After visiting their local GP in Noosa, Queensland, Ellie was referred to a pediatrician in Nambour who immediately organised an ambulance and overnight stay at Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital.

It was there that an ophthalmologist spotted a cherry-red spot on Ellie's retina at the back of her eye and that's when alarm bells started to ring clear.

As the family returned to their Noosa Heads home to celebrate Ellie's first birthday, the team of doctors confirmed their suspicions. Ellie had Tay Sachs disease.

Ellie and her parents : 'It felt like my whole world just stopped in that moment. My heart was absolutely broken,' Ms Topliff recalls the moment she and her husband received the news

Ellie grandmother is currently riding from Victoria to Queensland to raise funds for her treatment although at this stage there is no treatment and cure for the disease

'It felt like my whole world just stopped in that moment. My heart was absolutely broken,' Ms Topliff recalls the moment she and her husband received the news.

'We were thinking worst-case scenarios and in the back of my mind the worst case scenario was that she was that sick and she would die.'

'But I never actually thought the worst-case scenario would happen.'

Now Ellie is blind and she requires specialist equipment including a feeding tube, yet despite her ongoing battle with the disease, the little girl continues to smile.

'She has always being a very happy little girl. Always loved the water, I think she feels very relaxed and free so she is always giggling when she is in water,' she said.

'She absolutely loves music. Her dad sings to her every night and she's always singing.'

It's her seven-week-old brother Flynn who makes her smile the most.

'Whenever he is near her she seems to sense that he's there.'

'She has always being a very happy little girl,' said Ellie's mum despite her condition

For now the Topliff family celebrate each month of Ellie's life like a birthday.The next one is her 21st.

'We're going to invite friends and family and will have the 21st key.'

'We've got to make the most of every month,' Ms Topliff says.

To raise funds for Ellie's treatment, her grandmother is currently on a ride from Stanhope, Victoria to Tewantin RSL in Queensland.
