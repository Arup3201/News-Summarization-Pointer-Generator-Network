A protester so aghast with Silicon Valley's impact on the Bay Area has gone as far as to vomit on a Yahoo shuttle bus.

The mystery demonstrator was among a group of protesters picketing the buses that ferry employees of the big tech corporations to work, deeming them indicative of everything wrong with the hyper-gentrified Silicon Valley.

On Tuesday, the group blocked an intersection in San Francisco's Mission area, and protestors consisted of dancers in clown suit onesies.

But Valleywag.com reported that in Oakland, almost 50 'rebels' blocked a pick up zone for tech buses and one apparently vomited on the windshield of a Yahoo bus from its roof.

Sick of it: One protester so aghast with Silicon Valley's influence in the Bay Area has gone as far as to vomit on a Yahoo shuttle bus, pictured

A disturbing picture shows the sick, which supposedly was hurled on cue.

The action reportedly delayed shuttle buses from Apple bus, Google bus and Yahoo bus for more than half an hour.

Oakland police and Bay Area Rapid Transit officers 'pushed the demonstrators off the street.'

The interesting attack came as Google Ventures venture partner Kevin Rose posted a photo on Instagram of a hateful handout being distributed to his neighbors.

The flyer, titled 'Kevin Rose: Parasite,' reads: Greetings. Your neighbor, a man named Kevin Rose, is a parasite. Perhaps not of you, but of us. This is why we are here: to reveal him for what he is.'

Targeted: The note, which is emblazoned with a massive smiley face, goes on to attack Rose, pictured, for directing 'the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco'

The note, which is emblazoned with a massive smiley face, goes on to attack Rose for directing 'the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco.'

The protestors declare that the startups Rose funds 'bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs that have ravaged the landscapes of the city, and nearby Oakland.

'We are the ones who serve them coffee, deliver them food, such their c****, watch their kids, and mop their floors,' the flyer reads before concluding 'Nearly all of them are just like Kevin Rose and we are tired of this miserable and untenable situation.'

Rose, who co-founded Revision3, Digg, Pownce, and Milk, posted a photo of the note on Instagram on Sunday with the comment: 'My house was protested today by anti-tech folks, they had a large banner saying 'Kevin Rose Parasite,' handed these to my neighbors.'
