Accused: Achilleas Kallakis at Southwark Crown Court

It was claimed his company had assets in excess of $1 billion. However, a property tycoon at the centre of a £750 million fraud ran his office from a basement with just 'two and a half computers', a court was told.

Despite projecting an image of success and prosperity, Atlas Management Corporation was operating as if it was about to go bankrupt, with keys even falling off one computer keyboard as staff typed, it was claimed.

Millionaire Achilleas Kallakis - allegedly at the company's helm - and his 'right hand man' Alex Williams are accused of using forged documents to con banks out of money to amass a property empire.

Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Kallakis - who claims to come from a wealth Greek shipping dynasty dating back 200 years - asked accountants to cash cheques for him, for up to £20,000 at a time.

It is thought Kallakis was using the 
cash to fund
his 'very expensive lifestyle' of chauffeur-driven cars, private planes
and the upkeep of his own yacht, the court heard.

Kallakis and Williams - both aged 43 - are alleged to have bought 16 landmark properties on the back of the cash, which was mainly forked out by Allied Irish Bank (AIB).

However, AIB lost £56million when Atlas Management Corporation - which was based on forgeries - went bust.

Victor Temple QC, prosecuting the case, said money was coming in but 'almost immediately coming out again.'

The court today heard how Rodney Rezler, who was appointed chief accountant at the company, revealed how he was led to a basement room on his first day where there was only one working computer.

Chartered account Mr Rezler told the court: 'On the day I arrived I was led to a small basement room where there was one and a half working computers. They were not networked.

'I managed after a few days to scrounge a computer for myself. This was a laptop where the keys would fall off as I typed.

'There was no company system as such. There were little pools of information sitting on individual computers some of which had been in the accounts office and had now moved to unknown places.'

Mr Rezler said the accounts were so 'scattered' it was 'impossible' to check the rents were being paid on properties the company owned.

Asked how the company's finances were, he said: 'It was catastrophic. We were constantly bombarded, as I put the phone down the phone would ring again from another creditor asking where their money was. It was almost impossible to work.

'The company wasn't paying its bills. It was behaviour normally expected in companies that were about to go bankrupt.'

Mr Rezler said he told Mr Williams this but added: 'His basic view was that future financial ease would be coming. Large amounts of money were promised to follow through down the line and the problems would be dealt with.'

'The company was absorbing more money than it was producing'

When asked about Kallakis, Mr Rezler replied: 'Mr Kallakis was rarely in the office. One would often know if he had been in the office as he had a tendency to smoke cigars when he was around so one detected cigar smoke but not Mr Kallakis.

'Three months in I spoke to him about the accounts when I found that the situation had got worse because Mr Kallakis, having felt the property managers was not doing their job properly, had decided to review all the invoices personally. This created a bigger and bigger backlog.

'The company was actually absorbing more money than it was producing. It seemed money was being supplied into the company but there was not sufficient money coming in from rents to pay back loans.

'Mr Kallakis had a very expensive lifestyle. It was clear that a lot of money that went out was to pay for monthly requirements to run things because he had the yacht, the plane, accommodation costs.'

Asked by Mr Temple if he had ever been told anything about Kallakis' claim he was a Greek shipping heir, Mr Rezler said: 'Yes, he said the business had been in the family for about 200 years.

'My impression was it was an extremely wealthy shipping company that had been underpinning the establishment of the property business and that the property business itself was in control of about one billion dollars worth of assets.'

Mr Rezler told the court he had seen other accountants being asked to sign blank cheques on occasion.

Earlier chartered account Alf Burgess, who worked for Kallakis for almost six years, said: 'It could be anything from £2,000 or £20,000, but that [£20,000] was a one-off.'

Asked by Mr Temple who asked him to do that, Mr Burgess replied: 'Mr Kallakis.'

'Did you ever query that with Mr Kallakis?' asked Mr Temple. 'No, Mr Kallakis was the boss. He told me what to do,' Mr Burgess said.

Mr Rezler eventually resigned from the company before it went into liquidation as he was concerned Atlas Management was trading illegallym the court heard.

Kallakis and Williams deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud, 13 counts of forgery, five counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception.

The trial continues.
