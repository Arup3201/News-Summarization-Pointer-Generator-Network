You don't get to date tennis phenom Maria Sharapova without being a nice guy - and her current boyfriend, Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov, showed off his softer side Sunday during the Sony Open in Florida when he stopped his match to tend to a young ballgirl who was struggling with the 90-degree heat.

Dimitrov was in a first set tie-breaker with Kei Nishikori when he walked towards the ballgirls asking for a towel.

'Towel, please - towel please,' Dimitrov was forced to repeat himself when the girl didn't appear to spring into action and rush him a towel.

Class act: Dimitrov stopped his match on Sunday to help a ball girl who appeared to be struggling with the 90-degree heat

Dimitrov repeatedly asked for a towel from the young ball girl before noticing that she appeared to not be feeling well

Rescued: Once he realized the girl was ill, Dimitrov grabbed her hand and rushed her to a bench where paramedics could treat her

It was then that Dimitrov appears to notice that the girl seemed ill.

The 16th-ranked tennis player in the world then took the girl's hand and walked her over to a bench, where the medical staff could take a look at her - and it was all captured on film.

Tennis, unfortunately doesn't award points for being a nice guy - Dimitrov lost his match, but certainly gained some points in the arena of public opinion.

In addition to being Sharapova's girlfriend, Dimitrov gained notoriety in his early years for having a style of play similar to Roger Federer's.

In fact, the similarities earned him the nickname 'Baby Fed.'

Federer, however, was no fan of the nickname, telling reporters in October 'I hope people donâ€™t call him Baby Fed so often anymore. At first itâ€™s funny, but it gets annoying.'
