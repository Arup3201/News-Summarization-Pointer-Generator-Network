The teenager whose photo went viral after he was caught on camera  getting help from a Target employee before a job interview just received some very good news - he got the job.

Yasir Moore, 15, was helped to tie a tie by Dennis Roberts, an employee at the Target in Raleigh, North Carolina and was given a pep talk for his job interview at a Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant.

And it looks like the employee's act of kindness worked because the fast food chain officially hired him on Friday.

You're hired! Moore successfully completed a three interview hiring process with Chic-Fil-A and was hired on Friday

Heartwarming: A shopper at a Raleigh, North Carolina Target took this picture last week of employee Dennis Roberts helping a young man learn to tie a tie for a job interview at a nearby Chick Fil-A 

Moore successfully completed a three interview hiring process with Chic-Fil-A and news of his job was posted to Twitter on the company's page. 

The teenager now plans to show his appreciation to those who helped him by spending part of his first paycheck on a gift to express his thanks.

The photo of the ambitious teenager was posted online and quickly gained a lot of attention for the simple act of kindness that was on display. 

The picture went viral but he later found out about it at school.

'After I heard it went viral, I was in shock, I was amazed,' he told ABC11. 'It's one of the best things that ever happened to me.'  

Moore even returned to the store to thank the employees for their extraordinary customer service.

He got the job: His mother, left, is equally grateful to the strangers who showed her son kindness

His mother was equally grateful to the strangers who showed her son kindness.

'They could have just sold my son a tie,' said Najirah Parrish. 'But they took the time, helped him tie the tie and talked to him. They treated my son with dignity, respect.'

They also gave him real world advice to help him get a job.

'I did step-by-step what he told me,' Moore said.

Life coach! The folks at Target say they do this kind of thing every day. It's just that this time someone got a picture of it

Roberts' coworker Cathy Scott was the first to greet the customer on Wednesday when he came in looking for a clip-on tie for his interview. 

Since the store was out of the clip-on ties, she directed him to the regular ties but he didn't know how to tie it. 

After checking out, Scott brought the boy back to her co-worker Roberts. 

'Cathy says, 'Can you tie a tie?' I said, 'Yes,'' Roberts told WTVD. 'We took the wrapping off it, and I tied it on my neck, and fit it over head adjusted it and tightened it...fixed all his collar buttons and he was set to go.' 

Roberts then went on to help the young man prepare for his job interview by asking him the typical questions a hiring manager would ask.

'We said, 'Make sure you look him in the eye.' I'm saying make sure you give him a firm handshake, and she showed him... he tucked his shirt in,' said Roberts.

It was when he was giving the young man advice that Mark snapped her now-viral photo. 

 'It was a very quiet simple moment, but it was very profound honestly kindness... from strangers... in a Super Target,' Mark, a mother of three, said. 

'He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.''

The young man left the store as Roberts and the other employees wished him good luck and asked him to come back and tell them how it went. 

'We were just here to help a young man get a job and forward his future,' Roberts said. 

'When he told me all this advice, I got my confidence back,' said Moore. 'And so when I went for my interview I was calm, cool, and collected.' 

'You usually see friends or family help you do that kind of stuff, not just strangers you've never met before,' he said.
