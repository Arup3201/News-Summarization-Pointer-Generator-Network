Brazilian midfielder Anderson was always first to show off his dancing skills whenever Manchester United won a trophy. 

Unfortunately, his football was less memorable and he is destined to leave Old Trafford in January as one of the most expensive follies in Premier League history, alongside the likes of Fernando Torres and Andriy Shevchenko. 

United are prepared to let the 26-year-old move back to his homeland in the new year with Gremio and Flamengo leading the chase. And the Old Trafford club don't even want a transfer fee, so desperate are they to say 'Tchau' to one of Sir Alex Ferguson's worst-ever signings.

Anderson's fall has been spectacular, with the Brazilian midfielder making just one start this season

Anderson's only full outing came in the shock 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by League One side MK Dons

Sportsmail looks at the biggest transfer losses in Premier League history: 

Dimitar Berbatov (Man United)

Bought: £31m from Spurs, 2008 Sold: £5m to Fulham, 2012 Loss: £26m

Never fulfilled Sir Alex Ferguson's expectation that he would have the same influence at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona. United's pace was simply too quick for him and the smoking didn't help.

Robinho (Man City)

Bought: £32.5m from Real Madrid, 2008 Sold: £15m to AC Milan, 2010 Loss: £17.5m

Skipped a League Cup tie at Brighton in his first month at the club to go back to Brazil. Taken to task by Craig Bellamy for his attitude in training

Andy Carroll (LIverpool)

Bought: £35m from Newcastle 2011 Sold: £15m to West Ham 2013 Loss: £20m

Liverpool were panicked into buying Carroll when Fernando Torres told them at the 11th hour he wanted to join Chelsea. But Brendan Rodgers didn't fancy the big No9 and the club cut their losses

Andriy Shevchenko (Chelsea)

Bought: £31m from AC Milan, 2006 Sold: Free to Dynamo Kyiv, 2009 Loss: £31m 

Cost Jose Mourinho his job. The Special One had won two titles when Roman Abramovich gave him Shevhenko. The striker was badly past it and Mourinho was unable to handle the delicate situation

The cost of bringing Anderson to these shores for what he achieved is mind-boggling.

The transfer fee from Porto in 2007 was an estimated £26million and he has earned the same again in wages since then.

For the full £50m outlay, he has started 126 games in seven years, with another 53 appearances as substitute, and scored nine goals – around £5.5m a goal.

His last, and almost certainly final, appearance in a United shirt came as a late substitute in a goalless draw against Burnley in August.

You have to go back to December 2012 for his last goal in a United shirt, against Reaing.

He spent last season on loan to Serie A club Fiorentina but they didn't want him on a permanent basis either.

It had all started so well for Anderson. On arrival, he was hailed as United's next midfield general, ready to carry the mantle when Paul Scholes' called it a day.

The early signs were promising. He played 38 times as United won the Premier League and Champions League in his debut season.

He danced for the fans when they clinched the title in Wigan and he danced next to Wayne Rooney on a famous night in Moscow when United became champions of Europe for the third time. He was in the Brazil team, too. 

But something happened – and cynics would say the all-you-can-eat buffet.

Anderson's first season, when he scored in the penalty shootout in the Champions League final, turned out to be his best.

Every succeeding year, he appeared that little bit heavier, that little bit more sluggish and less trusted by his manager.

Anderson was hailed as a prodigy when United agreed to buy him from Porto in 2007 for £26million

The midfielder enjoyed some good times in his early years at United, playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo

Nani and Anderson were signed at the same time in the summer of 2007, but neither reached their potential

In February 2010, he ruptured a cruciate ligament against West Ham and insisted the operation was done by a specialist he knew in Portugal.

While still in rehab later that year, he was involved in a horrific car accident after leaving a nightclub at 6am, being pulled from a burning £125,000 Audi after it had crashed into a wall.

By this time, Anderson – once described as potentially 'better than Rooney' by Sir Alex's brother Martin – was turning into a figure of fun to United team-mates rather than a serious player. 

Anderson was never afraid of confrontation, as he showed by squaring up to Steven Gerrard in 2007

It has been a difficult seven years in Manchester for the midfielder, who was once heralded as a future star

Injuries have not helped the Brazilian's cause, and he has struggled for fitness in the past few seasons

Anderson has won eight caps for Brazil but his career has never hit the heights

Despite his troubles, Anderson picked up plenty of silverware at Old Trafford, including the 2009 league title

When David Moyes succeeded Ferguson, he took Anderson on the team's pre-season tour to hot and humid Asia, where Patrice Evra quipped in a video diary his job was to deliver Anderson's burger at one o'clock in the morning.

You didn't have to go far within Old Trafford for Anderson to be singled out as the individual who didn't buy into the club philosophy of displaying energy and hard work on the pitch.

Although he always possessed attacking flair, Anderson picked up a reputation as a tough tackler

Anderson's first season, when he scored a penalty in the Champions League final shoot-out, was his best

Now, with his contract due to run out in the summer without any hope of an extension, it looks as though Gremio will take him back. 

Gremio was where it all started for Anderson when he was a teenager with the world at his feet, and he got his dream move to Europe with Porto.

Ferguson's report on Anderson shortly before he retired was: 'Hasn't lived up to his potential'. Sadly, it looks unlikely he ever will now.
