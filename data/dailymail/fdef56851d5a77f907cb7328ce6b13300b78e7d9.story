North Korea's rocket scientists have been forced to hang their heads in collective shame following the spectacular failure of their latest long-range missile which blew up moments after launch.

Military leaders had hoped to show off their nation's technological prowess by blasting a satellite into orbit in what the West had called a covert test of missile technology and a flagrant violation of international resolutions.

But in deeply embarrassing episode for the communist country and its new leader Kim Jong-Un, the Unha-3, or 'Milky Way', rocket exploded 90 seconds after blast off and came crashing down into the Yellow Sea.

In a rare admission of failure, state
television reported within hours of the launch that the satellite had 
failed to reach orbit.

According to U.S. defence officials, the rocket flared brightly and apparently exploded about 90 
seconds into flight.

In the past North Korea have always declared
their launches successful despite evidence to the contrary from the 
international community.

But there are expected to be severe 
repercussions following the failure of the mission which was supposed to
mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of national founder Kim 
Il-sung.

'This is the first crisis for the new
leader that has just taken over,' said Lee Jong-won, a professor at 
Waseda University in Tokyo.

'It is inevitable that they will look
to find who is responsible for the failure, and I wonder what the 
treatment will be for those in the military and the hard-line officers 
who have pressed for the launch.'

North Korea had planned to make 2012 
the year in which it became a 'strong and prosperous nation' and the 
launch was part of a programme to burnish its credentials.

It even, unusually, invited foreign media in to cover the birthday celebrations and showed them the launch site.

Kim was named First Secretary of the 
Workers Party of Korea on Wednesday, as he accumulates titles and posts 
similar to those held by his father, Kim Jong-il who died in December.

The country is one of the most tightly controlled states on earth, with no free media and a tight grip on its population.

Worryingly some spectators have 
suggested the failure will prompt North Korea to press ahead with its 
third nuclear test to show its military strength.

A senior South Korean defence 
ministry official told a parliamentary hearing: 'The possibility of an 
additional long-range rocket launch or a nuclear test, as well as a 
military provocation to strengthen internal solidarity is very high.

'The two Koreas are divided by the 
world's most militarised border and remain technically at war after an 
armistice ended the Korean War in 1953.'

The launch came just weeks after a 
'Leap Year' deal that saw Washington agree to provide food aid. Among 
the promises Pyongyang made in return was not to launch any long range 
rocket or undertake nuclear tests.

In response to the launch the United States has now cancelled a planned food aid deal with the rogue state.

A White House official, aboard Air Force One, told reporters: 'We are not going forward with any agreement to provide them with assistance.'

There is likely to be pressure from 
leading countries to impose more sanctions on the North. But it poses 
difficulties for China which will likely resist further sanctions even 
though its own diplomacy failed to stop the rocket launch.

'After giving so much aid to North 
Korea, it still did not listen to China, and this hurt China-North Korea
relations and erodes domestic support in its continued support of North
Korea,' said Shen Dingli, a professor and regional security expert at 
Shanghai's Fudan University.

'This also undermines confidence in 
the U.S.-China relationship, and whether China had done enough to 
persuade the North. So, China is also a loser, but not as big a loser as
if North Korea succeeded in its launch,' he said.

A tough push for sanctions, which 
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged, could lead a show of 
defiance from the North such as a nuclear test, or an attack like the 
one in 2010 that saw it shell a South Korean island, killing civilians.

'Rather than any conventional 
provocation, I think North Korea will watch what U.S. and South Korea 
are doing and prepare for a nuclear test,' said Chung Young-chul, a 
professor at Sogang University's Graduate School of Public Policy.

The United States and Japan said the 
rocket, which they claimed was a disguised missile test and the North 
said was to put a satellite into orbit, crashed into the sea after 
travelling a much shorter distance than a previous North Korean launch.

Its failure immediately raised 
questions over the impoverished North's reclusive leadership which 
maintains one of the world's largest standing armies but which cannot 
feed its people without outside aid, largely from its solitary powerful 
backer, China.

'There is no question that the failed
launch turns speculation toward the ramifications for the leadership in
Pyongyang: a fireworks display gone bad on the biggest day of the 
year,' said Scott Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations.

In a highly unusual move, the North, 
which still claims success with a 2009 satellite that others say failed,
admitted in a state television broadcast seen by its 23 million people 
that the latest satellite had not made it into orbit.

The failure is the first major and 
very public challenge for the third of the Kim dynasty to rule North 
Korea just months into the leadership of a man believed to be in his 
late 20s.

'It could be indication of subtle 
change in the North Korean leadership in how they handle these things, 
something that may be different from the past,' said Baek Seung-joo of 
the Korea Institute of Defense Analyses a thinktank affiliated with 
South Korean Defence Ministry.

'I mean it would have been 
unthinkable for them to admit this kind of failure in the past, 
something that could be seen as an international humiliation. The 
decision to have come out with the admission had to come from Kim 
Jong-un.'

Embarrassingly, the rocket flew for 
just a few minutes covering a little over 100km to explode over a sea 
separating the Korean peninsula and China, far less than the last rocket
in 2009 that travelled 3,800km, alarming Japan which it over-flew.

The launch is in breach of United 
Nations Security Council sanctions and drew condemnation from the United
States, Russia, South Korea and Japan and threats to tighten already 
harsh sanctions aimed at stopping Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons.

The concern is that North Korea is 
using launches to perfect the kind of technology that would enable it to
build a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United 
States.

North Korea has repeatedly defended 
its right to launch rockets for what it says are peaceful purposes and 
may have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the failed launch.

Taking action: Hillary Clinton said Thursday, 'Pyongyang has a clear choice: It can pursue peace and reap the benefits of closer ties with the international community, including the United States; or it can continue to face pressure and isolation'

China, the North's main backer, again
appealed for 'calm', although its failure to dissuade Pyongyang from 
undertaking the launch despite propping up the ailing and impoverished 
state, showed the limitations of its diplomacy, analysts said.

'Despite the failure of its attempted
missile launch, North Korea's provocative action threatens regional 
security, violates international law and contravenes its own recent 
commitments,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Foreign ministers of the Group of 
Eight leading industrial nations condemned the launch as in breach of 
U.N. Security Council resolutions.

The North American Aerospace Defense 
Command, NORAD, said the first stage fell into the sea west of South 
Korea, and the remainder was deemed to have failed.

'No debris fell on land,' NORAD said. 'At no time were the missile or the resultant debris a threat.

The U.N. Security Council will meet 
to discuss a possible response to North Korea's rocket launch today,
said council diplomats.

Earlier this week U.S. Ambassador to 
the United Nations Susan Rice said the 15-nation council should 'respond
credibly' to a North Korean missile launch.

Western diplomats say that the most 
China, a permanent veto-wielding council member and North Korea's 
protector, would accept is a rebuke of Pyongyang.     

New sanctions, they said on condition of anonymity, are out of the question.
