Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is in line for a new 12-month contract.

The midfielder has become an integral member of Louis van Gaal's midfield after returning from a long-term ankle injury in November.

But another injury, this time a calf problem, has disrupted his season once more.

Carrick, whose current deal expires in June, has had his season disrupted by injury so far

Nevertheless, United want to extend the midfielder's stay at Old Trafford beyond his existing deal, which expires in June.

Carrick, who currently earns £130,000-per-week, has spoken of his plans to stay United.

And if all goes according to plan Carrick, 33, will sign a 12 month deal with an option for a further year.

Van Gaal and his assistant Ryan Giggs are both big admirers of the veteran midfielder and will push for the deal to be ratified sooner rather than later.
