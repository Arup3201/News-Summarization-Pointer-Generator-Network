A 57-year-old divorced mother-of-two has vanished from a San Francisco hospital leading to fears for her safety from concerned family and friends.

Lynne Spalding disappeared from her room at San Francisco General Hospital shortly after 10am on September 21.

Ms Spalding had been admitted to hospital after complications following an infection. She was being closely monitored by doctors every 15 minutes but vanished during one of her check-ups.

Missing: Lynne Spalding, 57, disappeared on September 21 from San Francisco General Hospital

Family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication which could have caused her to become disorientated. 

Mr Perry said: 'We find it disturbing 
that someone can go missing from the hospital. One would think there 
would be cameras or something.'

Ms Spalding, who is originally from the UK but lives in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city.

The 57-year-old is divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.

She is 5'6', 105lb and speaks with a strong accent. It is thought she will be wearing blue jeans, black boots and sweatshirt.

She is known to carry a bag which has 'San Francisco Pow Wow' embroidered on it. She has no cell phone and very little money. 

Anyone with information is asked to call San Francisco Police Dispatch at (415) 553-0123 and reference case #130796086

Concern: Family and friends have been posting this poster of the missing woman who was on medication which may have made her disorientated
