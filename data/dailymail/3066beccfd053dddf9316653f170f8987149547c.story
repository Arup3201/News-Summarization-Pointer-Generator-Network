A mother told yesterday how she tried in vain to save her four-year-old son after he fell into the sea from a jetty.

Dylan Cecil lost his footing as he played with his two younger sisters an inquest heard. He was carried away by strong currents as his mother Rachel McCollum cried ‘My boy, he’s gone’.

She and Dylan’s father Darren Cecil, 30, leapt into the water but were unable to find the boy and were also nearly swept away by the tide.

Rachel McCollum and  Darren Cecil  arrive at the Old Municipal Buildings, Taunton, Somerset, for the inquest into the death of their son today. Both parents desperately tried to save their son after he was swept away by waves

Miss McCollum, 27, said in a statement that Dylan had been paddling at the  jetty’s edge.

‘He was jumping and laughing. But he suddenly went into the water. I heard a plop,’ she said.

Dylan's body was discovered on August 23 by a walker who thought he had seen a child 'sleeping in the sand'

‘I couldn’t believe it was him. Then I realised it was and suddenly shouted to Darren, “He’s in, he has gone”.’

Miss McCollum, who wept throughout the
 hearing, said she immediately jumped into the water, which was much 
deeper than she had thought.

‘I was shouting, “My boy, he’s gone”. I
 expected to touch the sand as soon as I was in, but the water was so 
deep I was being dragged straight out. I scooped my arms to find Dylan 
but he was not there. It felt like I was in a whirlpool, I was being 
dragged everywhere. The current was so strong I couldn’t get back to the
 jetty, I was just caught in a whirlpool. The next thing I knew, a red 
ring [lifebelt] was being thrown around me.’

Mr Cecil, a poor swimmer, told how  he
 too had dived into the water at  Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to try to 
save his son. In a separate statement,  he said: ‘I saw Rachel jump in. I
 can remember her shouting, “Where’s  Dylan gone?”. I couldn’t see Dylan
 but I put my arms out in front of me to try and grab him.

‘I couldn’t find him but I was sure he
 had to be there because I jumped in at the exact point I saw his back 
bobbing up and down. I kept looking for Dylan but I couldn’t find him.

‘I had been dragged by the tide and was now about ten metres away from the jetty.

‘I was trying to swim against the 
current but I couldn’t. All my energy had gone, I was just exhausted. I 
remember saying, “I’m gone”. I really thought I was going to die.’

The inquest heard that the tide often washes over part of the concrete jetty at Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset,(pictured), which is about 492ft (150m) long and nearly 20ft (6m) wide

Witness Alyn Pritchard, said that 
moments before Dylan fell, he heard Miss McCollum telling him to keep to
 the left and away from the water’s edge. ‘You could see the little boy 
was jumping. But when he jumped the once, he went straight down the side
 and he never came up,’ he said.

Dylan’s body was washed ashore four days later.

Miss McCollum and Mr Cecil, from 
Kettering, Northamptonshire, had been visiting Dylan’s grandparents in 
Burnham-on-Sea last August with his sisters, Faith, three, and 
Alice-Kelly, 11 months, and cousin Georgie-May, two.

They decided to go for a seaside walk 
at around 6pm and wandered along the jetty to the water’s edge, where 
children were playing.

Flowers and tributes left at the scene. Mr Cecil, who said he was a poor swimmer, said he was barely able to take breath as he battled the surging water in the hope of finding his son

Candles spell out the name of Dylan Cecil amongst the mass of flowers left by friends, family and passers by exactly a week after he fell into the sea

More than 400 people joined Dylan's parents at St Andrew's Church in Burnham-on-Sea to remember him during a memorial service, while a minute's silence was also held for people to pay their respects near to where the little boy was last seen alive

But Dylan, who was wearing a blue 
T-shirt and blue shorts, is thought to have lost his footing, causing 
him to plunge into the  sea. The inquest, at Taunton,  Somerset, heard 
how the tides at Burnham-on-Sea are some of the highest and most 
powerful in the world.

It was estimated that the speed of the
 current on the day of the tragedy was around four or five knots, 
approximately 5mph. That would have been enough  easily to sweep  an 
adult off their feet.

Despite a search involving both the 
RNLI and the local Burnham Area Rescue Boat, it was not until four days 
later, on August 23, that Dylan’s body was discovered at Burnham Yacht 
Club.

A married couple who were visiting the club found the missing boy, who looked as if he was ‘just sleeping’.

PC Pete Wills, who attended the scene 
to recover the body, said it was ‘as if the sea had just given the boy 
back and placed him on the sand’.

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death by drowning, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose said the tragic 
events could not have been predicted or avoided.

Describing Dylan as a ‘lovable  and 
lively young boy’, he told the hearing: ‘This is something that could 
happen to any parent and there was nothing Dylan’s parents could have 
done to prevent this accident.

‘Dylan wanted to go down towards the 
sea and he was jumping about and I think just mistook his foothold. 
Neither he nor his parents realised how vicious the sea can  be. The 
tide was rising and tragically it was a spring tide which is the 
highest.’

Dylan would not have had a chance once he fell, Mr Rose said.

‘We cannot restrain children. They have a life to live. Sadly, this was a tragic way to end it.’
