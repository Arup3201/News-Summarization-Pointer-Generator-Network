After an assist and a goal for Spain against Macedonia on Monday night, 21-year-old Paco Alcacer stepped up in the absence of the injured Diego Costa as La Roja recovered from a poor 2014 World Cup.

Here, Sportsmail finds out more about the young Valencia frontman who has been quietly making a name for himself at the Mestella.

So who is Spain’s new striking sensation?

He’s Paco Alcacer, Valencia’s 21-year-old striker – one start, one assist and one goal are his international stats so far.

Name sounds familiar?

Top European clubs have been looking at Alcacer since 2010 when he top scored in the Under-17 Euros with six goals for Spain. He was free-scoring 16-year-old in Valencia’s youth academy at the time. 

He got 14 goals in total in that tournament including qualifying. Arsenal took a very close look towards the end of last season but Valencia – a selling club for so long but now under new ownership wanted to hang on to him.

Was his step up to the Spain first team predicted?

He got three goals for the Under-19s when they won the Euros in Rumania in 2011, scoring twice in the final against the Czech Republic and a year later he repeated the feat scoring this time in the semi-final against France. 

Spain love promoting their Under-21s so with Villa retired and neither Negredo or Torres in the sort of form to earn them a recall his chance has come.

But he has Diego Costa ahead of him still?

In theory yes. Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque has made Costa his own personal project after persuading him to switch from Brazil to Spain. But many see Alcacer’s style as better suited to Spain’s short passing game.

But he is not in Costa’s league?

We’ll he’s not even in the Champions League. He was farmed out to Getafe on loan in 2012 and he scored just four goals but still showed enough promise to be recalled and pushed up to the first team at Valencia last season. 

He repaid that faith with 14 goals and now he is the main man at Mestalla. He is not at Costa’s level but he is young and having come through the Spanish national youth system he fits perfectly in the senior side – unlike Costa who by his own admission is still adapting. 

Filling in: Alcacer could take advantage of Diego Costa's stuttering start to life in a Spain shirt 

International: Costa has struggled to find form for Spain despite a scoring start to life at Chelsea

What are his key strengths?

He is a finisher first and foremost. Quick, strong and clever enough to get in front defenders and get on the end of crosses in the six-yard box. Likes to finish with a first touch as he did to get the winner against Barcelona at the Camp Nou last season but also has the quick feet to make room for himself in the penalty area.

And he’s a No 9?

He’s technically good with the touch to play with his back to goal and hold the ball up for midfielders but he can also play in wider areas and for Spain against Macedonia he spent a lot of time running the left channel leaving David Silva to appear through the middle.

Could he still finish up in the Premier League?

His current contract runs out in 2016 and his buy out clause is set at £16million. Another good season and there will be plenty of takers at that price.
