When it comes to boxing stereotypes, Chris Algieri has shattered more than his fair share.

Born in the middle class town of Huntington on the north shore of Long Island, the 30-year-old still lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974.

His bookshelf is lined with tomes from Sun Tzu's The Art of War to Sugar Ray Leonard's autobiography to books on diet and nutrition.

American Algieri lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974 and will receive $1.5million 

He has a degree in health care sciences and a master's in clinical nutrition and has designs on going to medical school.

Algieri has no amateur career having made the transition from kickboxing six years ago and was virtually an unknown until he became a world champion in June.

But on Saturday he will earn around $1.5million when he takes on Manny Pacquiao in the gambling mecca of Macau.

Indeed, this will be the first fight that Algieri hasn't been working while training. On the Tuesday before his shock victory over Ruslan Provodnikov last summer, he was putting a personal training client through his paces.

'I worked with a lot of athletes helping them, especially combat athletes. Then also mums, middle aged mothers that want to get back in shape after pregnancy or just being home and not training. I had a very varied client list.' It was Algieri's grandfather who first piqued Algieri's interest in boxing with tales of Argentinean legend Carlos Monzon.

But despite being enthralled by the likes of Arturo Gatti, it was to martial arts and eventually kickboxing that a teenage Algieri turned.

A professional by 19, he won two world titles but after suffering a broken elbow and a badly-injured knee, decided the risk/reward ratio was skewed against him.

Six months later, he had switched to boxing.

'A lot of the [kickboxing] techniques are very similar to punch techniques,' says Algieri. 'The fact that I've been fighting without a headgear for such a long time I think has really helped with my defence in my pro boxing career.

'But, in terms of how this sport is fought; it's a totally different pace. Boxing is a lot faster, conditioning is a lot more intensive and fights are longer.' After 20 fights, all in New York, over a six-year period, he was pitted against light-welterweight champion Provodnikov, a hard-hitting Russian nicknamed the Siberian Rocky.

Algieri was knocked down twice in the first round but, despite his right eye closing during the fight, recovered to win a split-decision victory.

'It's zero to one hundred and that is just the nature of the game,' he says. 'It's nothing then boom! It's the nature of the business and I'm not surprised by it.

'I've been watching this sports for years and I have seen it with other fighters. I knew my time would come I just had to stay focused and disciplined and if you work hard good things happen. I am right where I am supposed to be.' On Saturday, that will be sharing a ring with Pacquiao, the eight-division world champion who still craves a shot at Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

But Algieri is confident he can punch a considerable dent in those ambitions.

'I've got length, I've got reach, I've got speed; I've got footwork and defence, but that's not what's going to be the difference in this fight,' he adds.

'It's not a tall guy versus a short guy - It's Chris Algieri versus Manny Pacquiao. It's what I bring to the table versus what he brings to the table. I think a lot of it has to do with my mental preparation and mind going into this fight as well as what we know from Manny. 

'We know Manny is a living legend. He's one of the greatest fighters that has ever lived. For me, I have to go out there and be myself. I have the talent and the tools to win this fight - I just have to go out there and perform.'
