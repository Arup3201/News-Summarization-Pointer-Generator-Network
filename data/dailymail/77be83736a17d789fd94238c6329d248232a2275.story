Barack Obama gave David Cameron a pre-election endorsement last night, praising Britain’s economic performance.

The two leaders sealed what was dubbed ‘the bro summit’ – after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his ‘bro’ – with a display of unity at the White House.

Suggesting Britain should stick to its economic course, Mr Obama said: ‘On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.’

Mr Obama went out of his way to repay the favour Mr Cameron gave when he visited the US just months before the 2012 presidential election, including a visit to watch baseball in the swing state of Ohio.

That visit angered some Conservative MPs, given that their party is traditionally allied with the Republicans.

Yesterday, however, it appeared to have paid off as Mr Obama lavished praise on the Tory leader and the special relationship between the US and the UK.

The two leaders struck agreements on a joint ‘cyber cell’ to counter the threat of cyber terrorism and on dispatching thousands more troops to join exercises in Eastern Europe – sending a message to Vladimir Putin.

There will also be co-operation on efforts to deradicalise those ‘poisoned’ by Islamic fundamentalists. Mr Cameron weighed in to support Mr Obama in a contentious American political debate.

He telephoned leading Republican senators to urge them not to press for new sanctions on Iran rather than continuing diplomatic efforts to persuade the country to abandon its nuclear programme.

The Prime Minister said the US President was a ‘great friend to Britain and to me personally’.

‘In the last six years since you became President, and in the nearly five years I have been Prime Minister, we have faced some big issues on our watch,’ he declared.

‘Those challenges have boiled down to one word: security. Economic security – the jobs and living standards of our citizens. And national security – the ability of our peoples to live safe and secure.’
