A burglar has been jailed after breaking into a hospital and stealing from a double amputee's bedside as she slept.

Richard Henderson, 39, was handed five years behind bars on Tuesday after being convicted of breaking into Hull Royal Infirmary and stealing a handbag from Victoria Johnson.

In a victim impact statement read out at Hull Crown Court, Ms Johnson said she could not believe anyone would steal from someone who had no legs.

Callous: Richard Henderson has been jailed for five years after being found guilty of breaking into a hospital and stealing a handbag from a patient. Right, Hull Royal Infirmary, the scene of his sickening crime

The court heard Henderson, who had a history of drug abuse, had broken into the hospital on May 3 at 1.30am. He crept into the ward where Ms Johnson was sleeping and stole her handbag from a bedside table.

The next day he returned to the scene of his crime and even spoke to Ms Johnson while she had a cigarette outside. She was in the hospital receiving treatment.

His twisted crimes were rumbled at 2am when he was seen by a member of staff rifling through the jacket of a colleague in a doctors' consulting room.

Police were called and Henderson was arrested at the hospital. It was the second time he had been arrested in the space of just two days.

The court heard he had been arrested and bailed on May 2 after causing damage to a car when he was drunk.

Jailing Henderson for the theft, Judge Mark Bury told him it was a 'disgusting' and 'despicable' offence.

Henderson, of no fixed abode, was also convicted of benefit fraud. He had stolen Â£6,500 after applying for disability allowance in the name of a disabled man who was ill and infirm.

Henderson has previous convictions for burglary, including one for breaking into Bridlington Hospital in December 2011.

Henderson pleaded guilty to fraud and two counts of burglary in relation to his latest offences.

A spokesperson for Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We're continuing to work with Humberside Police to deliver a safer hospital environment for our patients, staff and visitors.

'All reported cases of theft are investigated fully both internally and externally in partnership with the police.'
