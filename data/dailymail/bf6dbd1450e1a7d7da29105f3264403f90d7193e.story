It's entertained the likes of Mick Jagger, David Bowie, models galore and stars of the tennis world - and now's your chance to own the Kensington Roof Gardens... if you've got £200million to spare.

Sprawled across the top of the art deco former Derry & Toms department store in west London, the 1.5 acre site is one of the most glamorous party venues in the capital.

And unlike other celebrity haunts, it comes complete with fruit trees, a stream filled with fish, and a flock of flamingos.

Richard Branson's Virgin group has held the lease on the Grade II-listed gardens since 1981 and hosts the annual pre-Wimbledon tennis party attended by the world’s top players.

The 1.5 acre site is one of the most glamorous party venues in the capital - and is on the market for £200m

But now the building housing the roof gardens has been put on the market by its Asian owners.

Agents Jones Lang LaSalle are believed to have been appointed to find a buyer, according to the Property Week website.

It
 is not certain when Mr Branson's lease expires, according to a 
spokesman from Property Week, and any decision to renew it would be down
 to the new freeholder.

Laid
 out between 1936 and 1938, the gardens are the largest of their kind in
 Europe and are divided into three themes: Moorish style, based upon the
 Alhambra in Spain, with fountains, vine-covered walkways and Chusan 
palms; Tudor style garden, with archways, secret corners, hanging 
wisteria and summer-scented blooms, and English woodland garden, with 
over 100 species of trees, protected by an order from 1976.

After Derry & Toms closed in 1973
 the building — known as 99 Kensington High Street — became the site for
 the Biba fashion store when stars such as Mick Jagger, David Bowie and 
Marc Bolan could be seen wandering around the gardens.

The joint owners, Singaporean property company CapitalLand, Asian conglomerate Genting and hotel operator HPL, are asking £200m for the block, which also includes 1 Derry Street and 25 Kensington Square

Since 1975 the 400,000 sq ft interior 
has been offices, with the main tenant now being record label Sony BMG. 
It also houses the American health club Equinox.

But
 the gardens remained as they were, having been listed in 1978. Babylon 
Restaurant opened on the 7th floor in 2001 giving diners views of the 
English Woodland Garden from the terrace.

The
 joint owners, Singaporean property company CapitalLand, Asian 
conglomerate Genting and hotel operator HPL, are asking £200million for 
the block, which also includes 1 Derry Street and 25 Kensington Square, according to the Evening Standard.

The
 Derry Gardens, as they were originally known, were inspired by similar 
roof gardens at the Rockefeller Centre in New York and designed and laid
 out by landscaper Ralph Hancock.

Unlike other celebrity haunts, the gardens come complete with fruit trees, a stream filled with fish, and a flock of flamingos

Laid out between 1936 and 1938, the gardens are divided in three and are the largest of their kind in Europe
