The mother of a toddler who rolled onto a drug addict’s needle in a park is facing an agonising wait to see if her daughter has caught HIV.

Two-year-old Siann Parkinson was doing barrel rolls down a grassy slope when she landed on the discarded hypodermic syringe.

The needle pierced Siann’s right thigh, causing the youngster to scream out.

By the time mum Annabel, 25, turned round, Siann had pulled the syringe out and was holding it with blood splattered on her trousers.

Anxious wait: Annabel Parkinson will have to wait for up to two months to learn if her daughter Siann has contracted HIV

Horrified Miss Parkinson, a hairdresser, rushed the youngster to hospital and Siann was given a Hepatitis B injection and blood tests.

They now face a distressing two-month wait until Siann can have more blood tests and injections to see if she has caught HIV from the needle.

The incident happened on a grassy embankment by the cricket pavilion in King’s Park, Bournemouth, Dorset.

Miss Parkinson said: 'One moment Siann was playing happily, throwing a ball for Jessie, our Staffordshire terrier dog, and rolling down the embankment in the park and the next we were rushing to hospital.

'She shouted out and I could see the needle in her hand, I thought she had picked it up but then I noticed blood on her right thigh and realised she had pulled it out of her leg.

'When I looked closer I could see that she had stabbed herself and also been scratched by the needle, I was horrified.

'We were seen within five minutes in hospital.

'Siann had a Hepatitis B injection and a blood test but we were told we would have to come back in June and July to have more injections and blood tests.

'It’s only when they can compare the three blood tests that they can say for definite whether Siann has contracted HIV.

'It will feel like an eternity before I know for certain whether Siann is okay.

'The risk that she has been infected with HIV is small but it’s like there is a big, black cloud hanging over us.

'I’ve lived here all my life, the park is on our doorstep but there’s no way I will ever take her back there.

'It’s a public park and lots of children play there, but it is also somewhere drunks and, obviously, drug addicts congregate.

'Something should be done to ensure that families are safe.'
