Cristiano Ronaldo has shown he is capable of pulling off a trick away from the football pitch as well as on it.

The Real Madrid superstar dressed up as a homeless man by wearing a wig and fake moustache in order to surprise a young fan.

Ronaldo, who recently won his third Ballon d'Or title by beating Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to the prestigious award, placed himself in Madrid's Plaza del Callao.

The 29-year-old eventually removed his disguise to reveal his true identity to a young boy, who appeared to be delighted at meeting the Portugal forward.

Ronaldo then gave the young boy a signed football and a hug before a number of passers-by whipped out their cameras to get a snap of the former Manchester United star.

La Liga ace Ronaldo will be hoping he can deceive Cordoba's defenders when Real Madrid take on Miroslav Djukic's side at the weekend.

Ronaldo is currently leading the La Liga goalscoring charts with a staggering 28 goals in 17 league games.
