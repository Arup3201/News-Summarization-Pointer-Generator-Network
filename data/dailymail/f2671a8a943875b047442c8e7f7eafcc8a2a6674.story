The fight to clinch a third world title shot for George Groves will be as expensive as the one which just saw him claim the European super-middleweight title was unexpectedly arduous.

It will begin this bright Monday morning.

Kalle Sauerland, the Saint’s German promoter, will call WBC headquarters in Mexico City to press the claim for Groves’s mandatory challenge to Anthony Dirrell to take precedence over a voluntary defence.

Groves' promoter hopes to persuade Anthony Dirrell to open up a world title fight 

But Anthony Dirrell (right), taking on Sakio Bika here, will take some convincing to take the fight 

That decision is likely to rest with Dirrell and Sauerland knows he will have to make the American ‘an offer to come to London which is too good for him to refuse’.

He adds: ‘It will be about the cash and fortunately we have the resources to deal with that.’

Having invested heavily in Saturday night’s promotion at Wembley Arena — even to the extent of flying in MC Michael Buffer from the US to make his rumbling announcement of the main event — Sauerland is prepared to dig deep again in the interests of a Londoner he proclaims as ‘one of the most exciting young boxers in the world’.

Still, it is by no means certain that Dirrell will take the bait. He has made it clear that he considers Groves to be unworthy of another chance so quickly after being stopped twice by IBF world champion Carl Froch.

Dirrell goes so far as to suggest that the Saint should prove himself by giving British rival James DeGale a rematch.

In monetary terms, Dirrell’s position is not as simple as the Groves camp would wish. A long-term strategy of a reasonable pay-night against a handpicked opponent he can be sure of beating, followed by a big bucks trip to England, would put even more cash in his bank account.

Since Groves is determined to keep busier now, that scenario would require him to find an interim opponent in the new year.

It is important that he should get back into the ring by then, now that he has dealt with the stress of returning from his shattering KO by Froch on that May night at Wembley Stadium.

It is never easy to come back from such a loss and Groves admitted he was ‘tense’ going into the ring to face Christopher Rebrasse, adding: ‘You can never be sure what will happen in the first fight back after a defeat but my confidence is still there and I felt good.’

He was impressive in the first half of the fight, starting at a furious pace in an attempt to secure an early stoppage and winning the first seven rounds on my card. But when the knockout failed to materialise, there were tell-tale signs of him fading again and the obdurate Rebrasse enjoyed some success in the closing stages.

The decision was comfortably unanimous — with Rebrasse agreeing he was well beaten on points — but not as emphatic as Groves would have liked against a second-tier super-middleweight.

The only rematch which interests him is a third rubber with Froch. The Nottingham Cobra, a ringside commentator, discounted that possibility and advised Groves to take another rebuilding fight rather than rush in against Dirrell.

Froch — still considering his own future — added: ‘George still looks easy to hit at the moment. He might have been in some trouble against a heavier puncher than Rebrasse. Dirrell would grind him down over the 12-round stretch.’

That is a niggling worry but Groves says: ‘The plan is to get Dirrell over here early next year and win my world title.’

The Saint is back, as brash as ever — which is good for British boxing — but as he concedes: ‘There is still a long road to go.’
