Re-live all the drama here 

Manchester United have shown their financial muscle by completing a stunning deadline-day deal for Radamel Falcao after moneybags neighbours City were put off by the staggering cost.

Monaco’s Colombia striker arrived on a private jet to tie up a season-long loan to Old Trafford for a fee of £6million, with an option to buy him next summer for a further £46m.

Falcao told www.manutd.com: 'I am delighted to be joining Manchester United on loan this season. Manchester United is the biggest club in the world and is clearly determined to get back to the top.

'I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal and contributing to the team’s success at this very exciting period in the club’s history.'

Atletico Madrid (2011-13): 91 apps/70 goals

Monaco (2013-14): 22 apps/13 goals

Colombia: 51 caps/20 goals

Manager Van Gaal added: 'I am delighted Radamel has joined us on loan this season. He is one of the most prolific goalscorers in the game. His appearance-to-goal ratio speaks for itself and, when a player of this calibre becomes available, it is an opportunity not to be missed.'

But United have had to pay the 28-year-old around £280,000 a week to persuade him to leave the tax haven. Falcao, who will wear the No 9 shirt at Old Trafford this season, was initially offered to English clubs over the weekend for personal terms of £345,000 a week, and while City officials held talks with Monaco and Falcao’s representatives, they were put off by the size of the deal, which also deterred Arsenal.

That left the door open for United to make their move on Sunday night, just four days after agreeing a British record fee of £59.7m with Real Madrid for Angel di Maria.

United wanted another striker because they have concerns that Robin van Persie still has problems from the knee injury he suffered near the end of last season and could yet need surgery.

It is understood United persuaded Falcao to accept the same sum they are paying the Argentina midfielder, which is slightly less than the £300,000 a week earned by captain Wayne Rooney. United also tied up the £14m signing of Ajax midfielder Daley Blind, who joins Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo at Old Trafford after a summer that has seen them spend around £160million.

Blind, 24, said: ‘It is a real honour to sign for Manchester United. Louis van Gaal is a tremendously talented coach, I have worked with him at Ajax and also for Holland and I cannot wait to work with him at the biggest club in the world.’

Moving on: Javier Hernandez (left) is joining Real Madrid after struggling to hold down his place at United

Time up: Danny Welbeck is also expected to leave on deadline day with Tottenham one possible destination

£147.1m - Amount spent by United in the summer transfer window, more than any other team in the country

200 - Goals scored by Falcao during his club career

£10m - United’s net spend this summer is around £10million higher than Jose Mourinho’s entire net spend in his two spells at Chelsea

7 - United have signed seven players this summer, the most in one window since the summer of 2007

0.66 - Falcao’s goals per game rate in his club career, much better than the PL’s top strikers.

Aguero 0.48, Van Persie 0.47, Rooney 0.45, Dzeko 0.44, Giroud 0.42, Sturridge 0.39, Balotelli 0.39, Costa 0.38

Van Gaal welcomed a player he used on the left side of Holland’s defence at the World Cup but is more likely to deploy as a holding midfielder at United.

‘I am delighted Daley has signed for the club,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He is a very intelligent and versatile footballer who can play in many positions. Daley is a great reader of the game and he has played under my philosophy over a number of years.’

Falcao’s arrival meant striker Danny Welbeck was allowed to join rivals Arsenal in a £16m deal, while Javier Hernandez went to Real Madrid on a season-long loan, with an option for a £16m permanent move.
