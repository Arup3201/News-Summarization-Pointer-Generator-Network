A man's survival after being struck by the deadly fangs of a King Brown snake has proven that Storm Trooper's armour really does saves lives.

Scott Loxley, who has taken on the mammoth task of walking 5,000km around Australia in the Star Wars outfit for charity, has seen many a snake in the past 14 months.

But it wasn't until Wednesday when he was leaving the one-horse town of Yalboroo in Queensland that he was attacked by one of the most venomous of the species.

Although the armour, made out of ABS plastic and held together with fibre glass and tape, has clearly seen better days  - the attire served its purpose as Scott walked away with just a few scratches.

A truly great story for the generations that would even make Darth Vadar beam with pride.

Scott Loxley is walking 5,000km around Australia in a Storm Trooper outfit for charity and was struck by a King Brown snake on Wednesday

He luckily survived with just a few scratches but not before the snake followed Scott around his trolley and finally gave up about 30 seconds later - the weather-beaten armour saved the day

'I thought it was a dead snake at first which I see all of the time,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was only a foot away when it reared up at me and bit my shin. 

'I felt his teeth sink in but then slide down because he couldn't penetrate through the plastic.'

The lethal fella did not stop there as he started to follow Scott around his trolley that he travels with.

'He was watching me and then following me,' he explained.

'I would move to the left around the trolley and so would he - then I would go to the right and then he would do the same.'

The stand-off lasted for about 20-30 seconds before the scaly predator slithered away.

Scott thought he was done for and waited for the pain to take hold but much to his surprise he was fine.

'I was pretty happy - I've had a lot of near misses and thought I was finally bitten after coming this far,' he laughed.

'He had his best shot and blew it.'

Scott doesn't like to think of the alternative scenario as the place, with only a few houses, is a good 40 minutes from Mackay where the paramedics would have come from.

'I would have had to sit down, dial 000 and wait - I'm very lucky.' 

Scott lives off roadkill including snakes, lizards, goat and kangaroo for weeks at a time

His target is to raise $100,00 funds for Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne

The 47-year-old left his hometown of Melbourne on November 2 last year to raise funds for the Monash Children's Hospital and hopes to see his wife and three children by July next year - or earlier if his weary blistered feet can get him there any sooner.

The former soldier spends weeks at a time not speaking to anyone other than himself and the animals that cross his long endless dusty path - with fresh roadkill now a regular part of his daily diet.

The simple rule of thumb that Scott abides by when deciding if the animal is safe to eat is 'if it's bloated I don't touch it - if it's still bleeding I eat it.'

The tasty wildlife includes cooking lizards until crispy and putting them in ziplock bags to snack on during the trek and tying live snakes to his trolley until they are suitably fried by the sun. 

Scott, who says it all comes down to survival, has also feasted on a cow, goat and many a Kangaroo by cooking the meat on a wire grill.

'I can only carry so much food - it's not like there's always a servo up the road,' he said. 'I need the protein to keep going.'

Scott has been travelling for just over 14 months now and hopes to make it back to Melbourne in July next year

The 47-year-old goes days and weeks without showering or talking to anybody

With only himself and the animals to talk to - Scott is quickly getting sick of his own compnay

He is currently in Coolalinga located 26 km southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory

He was taught survival skills in the army but never used them to such an extreme until now.

'You pick up things along the way - it comes naturally because if you don't eat - you are going to die.'

But don't feel too sorry for the lone adventurer - when Daily Mail Australia caught up with Scott he was chowing down on a Macca's Quarter Pounder meal  in Coolalinga - 26 km southeast of Darwin.  

'Anything that you don't cook yourself tastes awesome,' he said.

A year into his crazy adventure - Scott can now tick off the following places on his mammoth list: Tasmania, the Nullarbor Plain - from the east to the west coast - and then up to Broome and across the Northern Territory border to Catherine and Darwin. 

He doesn't advise anyone to take on this challenge on their own: 'solo is not the way to go - it's way too hard'

Scott is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable

Literally living in his own stench - Scott can go days or weeks without showering or brushing his teeth because he needs to conserve all of the water that he is carrying in his trolley for drinking.

'I feel absolutely terrible when I put on my black skins in the morning I can't stand the smell but I can't afford to use the water for washing my clothes,' he said.

Scott is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable.

He rolls his swag out under any form of shelter that he stumbles across including BBQ areas, outside toilet blocks and under trees.

Made out of ABS plastic, the suit is a bit worse for wear and is being held together with fibre glass and tape - but at the least the clanging of the armour scares off the snakes.

'It's ridiculous - I have no range of movement,' he said. 'It's really uncomfortable and rubs causing welts and blisters.'

'I'm surprise it has lasted this long.' 

Only being unwell once briefly when coming into Adelaide, it's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge

Scott has gone through 20 pairs of shoes. His current pair have been the most endurable lasting 3,000 km after he made a sole from a blown-out tyre on the side of the road.

Only being unwell once briefly when coming into Adelaide, it's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge.

'I'm constantly arguing with myself - I start questioning it and thinking no one cares and that I'm yesterday's news,' he said. 

'When I haven't seen anybody for a long time I think it's a case of out of sight - out of mind.'

'Then I see someone and they say something encouraging and I'm on top of the world again - and that cycle keeps going,' he said.

'I've been winning and losing throughout the whole battle.' 

Scott is eternally grateful for the support of his family - especially his understanding wife, Sally.

'She knows me - I've been talking about doing it for a long time - so she said to get it out of the way,' he said.

'I owe her big time after this - I'll make it all better again.'

He said the people he meets along the way keeps up his spirits 

Scott would never advise anyone to take on this epic challenge without support.

'Solo is not the way to go - it's way too hard,' he said. 

'Do it with a couple of people or a group for the mental stimulation and to encourage each other.'

He's very quickly getting bored of his own company. 

'I'm sick of hearing my own voice - you have to constantly keep motivating yourself because you spend 10 hours a day looking at a white line,' he said.

'I talk to the animals that coming running to the fence.'

But the courageous Star Wars character won't give up until he makes it home with raising his target of $100,000 for the Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne.

'If I don't reach the target I will deem it a massive epic fail,' he said.
