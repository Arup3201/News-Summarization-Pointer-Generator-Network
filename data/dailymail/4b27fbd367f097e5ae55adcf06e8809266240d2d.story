This is the heartwarming moment a firefighter brings a fire-stricken cat back from the brink of death by resuscitating it with a pet-sized oxygen mask.

The unfortunate feline had been plucked from the ashes of a house fire that killed a 74-year-old man, who is thought to have retired from the local fire department just weeks before.

Photographs of the aftermath show a somber-eyed firefighter as she holds the cat's head steady in an oxygen masks while waiting outside the burned building in Nassau Bay, Texas.

The woman, identified as a volunteer by markings on her protective gear, was then seen lifting the revived kitten up away from the rescue equipment as it opens its eyes and starts to look around.

It is then carried away from the scene by another firefighter looking alive and alert once more.

The fire, which began around 10am Saturday, killed the elderly man and caused minor injuries to a woman, the Bay Area Citizen reported. He is thought to have been a firefighter until his retirement last month.

Officers were called to a one-story home which was being overtaken by flames and smoke. Firefighters inside the burning building found the man's body, then also found the cat. 

It is unclear to whom the cat belongs. Another cat is missing.The fire marshal's office is investigating the blaze.

Away: The cat was carried off from the scene, looking alert again. An elderly man died and a woman was injured in the blaze
