A 33-storey waterfront complex inspired by a 'lucky' bronze coin is failing to live up to its reputation after polarising public opinion.

The coin-shaped design of the new Guangdong Plastics Exchange building has been receiving criticism from locals even before its construction has finished.

Designed by Italian architect Joseph di Pasquale, the circular design is thought to be lucky in Cantonese culture.

The 33-storey building, shaped like a lucky coin, is getting closer to completion but not all residents are happy with it

But according to reports the 1 billion yuan building, situated on the Pearl River in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, has been on the receiving end of unsavoury comments from residents.

The 453ft high building, which features a 154ft diameter hole in the centre, is shaped after a number of objects the Cantonese associate with luck and good fortune.

Chief project engineer Wang Zhanshan said: 'It's a real fusion of Western and Chinese design.

'The distinctive feature of the building is that it is shaped like an old Chinese jade or a waterwheel and also has good feng shui for attracting fortune.

'A golden coin, jade or waterwheel alongside the river means luck to Cantonese: Water brings money.'

But according to the Shenzhen Daily, some residents have failed to see any positive message in the design.

Guangzhou resident He Huiying said: 'I canâ€™t see any beauty in the two buildings.

'Two golden coins? It only exposes the naked desire of the authorities and the property owners to chase money.'

Wang has defended the criticism the building had received from residents.

He said: 'Beauty is different to different people. If the building is discussed before and after its completion, it will have already proved it is a successful piece of architecture.'
