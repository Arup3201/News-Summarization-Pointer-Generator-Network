Some fisherman will do anything to catch a big one but when it means wading into waist-deep, crocodile-infested waters you have to wonder if it's actually worth it.

Onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man, who spent 'at least 15 minutes' in the water at Shady Camp on the Mary River in the Northern Territory.

Jason Rogers was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water. He said that at the time there was a four-and-half-foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing.

To the shock of onlookers the man is seen fishing waist-deep in crocodile infested waters 

Mr Rogers has been a fishing guide in the area for 24 years and said that the spot was known for its barramundi fishing.

'It was one of the most dangerous things I've seen happen for years. The man just pulled up in a car with his mates and trotted off to the other side,' Rogers, 45, said. 

'Then he waded in up to his waist and started fishing even though there were four or five crocs in and around him.

'But it's not the first time I've seen it happen. It didn't worry him at all. People are willing to take a chance so that they can catch some good barramundi.' 

The man was fishing for barramundi and took no notice of the crocodiles around him

Mr Rogers had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water.

'He was in there for at least 15 minutes. When he was out in the water you couldn't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly. I'll never know how he didn't get eaten,' he said. 

It's believed that the man was from Darwin Mr Rogers said, and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi. 

Initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished

'I've seen a lot of silly stuff with people going out and doing exactly the same thing as this man. But the thing is 20 years ago there wasn't as many crocodiles around. There's a bigger population of crocodiles now,' Mr Rogers said.

'A lot of people get taken and it's all because of stupidity. It can happen as quick as a wink, so if you get into the water up to your chest like this you wouldn't even see one coming.

'There'd be absolutely nothing you could do about it. He may have done this before, but the way he's going he won't be doing it for much longer.'
