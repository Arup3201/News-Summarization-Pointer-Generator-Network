An irate Will.i.am took to twitter to criticise United Airlines for being left behind after his seat on a flight from New York to China was given away.

The Black Eyed Peas rapper  arrived at the New York airport 45 minutes before the international flight was due to take off but  airport officials were unable to let him on the flight.

He quickly  broadcast his frustrations to his 12 million twitter followers  in a series of angry posts.

Not a happy bunny: Will.i.am criticised United Airlines after his seat was given away on international flight

The first said: 'Make sure when you fly china via @united you get to the airport 1day before because they'll give your seats away' 

He followed with: 'I'm flying to china and @united just gave my seats away....#wtf

The rant continued with a list of examples of other airlines the star flies which he doesn't experience trouble with.

Angry: The rapper expressed disbelief at the airlines decision to give away his seat to another passenger 

'I fly@BA @quantas @koreanAIR @singaporeAIR & they wait for premium passengers to arrive...they don't give away your seat like @united'  

The rapper whose real name is William Adams then explained what a close call it had been. 'Plane leave at 1:15 I got to the airport at 12:30...@united is the worse...I should have learned from the last @united experience'  

'Premium passenger': According to the star, had he been travelling with other airlines, they would have waited

A small window: He left 45 minutes to check in, get through security and board according to another tweet

United Airline representatives advise travellers to check in at the airport at least an hour before their scheduled departure time. 

Star treatment: Rapper tweeted airlines such as British Airways and  Singapore Airlines would wait for 'premium passengers to arrive'

Bad PR: Earlier this year will.i.am said he'd been removed from a United Airline Global First Lounge

While some Twitter users were sympathetic to his plight, others responded less so. Chartered financial planner from Aberdeen Mhairi Hay @Mhairi72 commented '@iamwill @united don't be so spoiled.....45 mins b4 a transatlantic flight due to leave is not enough..needs to be 1 hr 30 mins!'

It's not the rapper's first run in with United Airlines.

Earlier this year he tweeted that he'd been removed from a United Airline Global First Lounge after staff suspected his membership card was fake.
