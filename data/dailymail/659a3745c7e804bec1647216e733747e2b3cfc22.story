They are the two things Shetland is most famous for – so it’s perhaps surprising no one had the idea before.

Shetland ponies and Fair Isle knitwear are beloved across the world, so why not combine the two?

The result is two cosy-looking mares dressed in button-down Fair Isle jumpers to promote the Year of Natural Scotland.

The ponies, named Fivla of Finnister and Millhouse Vitamin, were bang on trend, following Victoria Beckham and Rihanna who have also stepped out in Fair Isle designs

The jumpers were made by Shetland designer Doreen Brown ¿ a little longer in length and shorter in the arm than she is used to. They are hand-knitted using wool from native Shetland sheep

The ponies, named Fivla of Finnister and Millhouse Vitamin, were bang on trend, following Victoria Beckham and Rihanna who have also stepped out in Fair Isle designs.

However, sadly the ponies got their jumpers rather a lot more muddy and had to take them off for washing.

Jo Tonkinson, co-owner of Thordale Shetland Driving Centre, which provided the ponies, said: ‘It was quite simple – we sent the ponies’ measurements to the knitter, who sent back two jumpers.

‘We just had to put their two front legs in and they buttoned under the stomach.

‘It was perhaps an odd request, to get the ponies in Fair Isle, and a bit silly, but they were perfectly happy. Hopefully these pictures will make people smile.’

Fivla and Millhouse are used to wearing harnesses so were completely comfortable in their new clothes

The jumpers were made by Shetland designer Doreen Brown – a little longer in length and shorter in the arm than she is used to. They are hand-knitted using wool from native Shetland sheep.

Fivla and Vitamin are used to wearing harnesses so were completely comfortable in their new clothes.

Ponies from Thordale have previously starred in Norwegian drama series Himmelbla and in a travel series with BBC journalist Paul Murton.

The photo shoot was dreamed up by tourist board Visit Scotland to launch 2013 as the Year of Natural Scotland.

Events taking place this year include Up Helly Aa on Shetland, which is Europe’ s largest Viking fire festival.

That will be followed by illuminated woodland trails for next month’s Snowdrops by Starlight at Cambo Estate in Fife and family treasure hunts on horseback during the Wild Spring Festival in Dumfries and Galloway this March and April. 

The Spirit of Speyside whisky festival comes in May, followed by the 173rd Royal Highland Show in June.

Bear Grylls is hosting his first Survival Academy in the Scottish Highlands this year, the Cairngorms national park turns ten years old and visitors can stargaze at the UK’s first Dark Sky Park in Dumfries and Galloway.
