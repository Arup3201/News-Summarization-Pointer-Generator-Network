When Hayley Statham resolved to give herself a middle name, she - bravely - decided to let strangers on the internet choose what it would be.

Now the 29-year-old has been bombarded with a series of truly bizarre names including Vanillabean, SpongeBob, Looney and Banana-hammocks.

Ms Statham, from from Macclesfield, Cheshire, may even see the middle name Jason on her passport and driving licence after one donor suggested the name of the Hollywood action star.

Hayley and Jason: Hayley Statham may soon have the middle name 'Jason' - after the action film star - because she has decided to let internet users decide her middle name for charity

The Staths: Actor Jason Statham, star of The Expendables and The Transporter films, and Hayley who is hoping to raise £1,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support

The saleswoman, who was not given a middle name at birth, will pluck the winning name out of a hat on July 31 after well-wishers made a donation to charity in return for making name suggestions.

Cash pledges have so far reached almost £400 and Hayley is hoping to raise £1,000 for Macmillan after her friend's mother, who she describes as 'a second mum,' was struck down with cancer and died in May 2012.

She said: 'I have always been one of those people that loves taking risks and being a bit adventurous and up for a laugh.

'I am always up for something different like bungee jumping or skydiving so I am pretty excited to be getting a middle name even if it will be ridiculous.

Johnhughes, Gertrude, Jagerbomb, Marge, Biggles, Snowden, PRISM, Jason, Vanillabean, Norah, Mercury, Isaac, Banana-Hammock, Amazing, I Love Football, Pyjamas, Bea, Vimto, Spongebob, Gertrude, Looney, Tallulah, Daisy, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Mirrormirror, Middle, Alice (in Wonderland), Jason, Lambrini, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, Chardonnay, Ralph, Conchita, Pebbles and Wadio.

A name will be picked out of a hat. Names like Bananahammock, Gertrude and Biggles could soon appear on her passport

'The idea came up when we were chatting at work and my colleagues didn't believe I had a middle name.

'They thought it would be hilarious to suggest some names and pick it out of a hat but it ended up growing from there.

'No one is surprised in the slightest that I am doing this fundraiser, they think it is typical me.

'Don't get me wrong I would be gutted if I got something stupid like Ralph or Betws-Y-Coed but I won't go back on my word.'

She added: 'I would absolutely love Marge to be my middle name after my friend's mum who has cancer. But I love Summer as well, to be honest any middle name would do, I am just excited to see it on all my documents.'

'It started out as a bit of fun in the office between us girls but it really has grown into something that a lot of people are getting involved with.

'Cancer affects all of us which is why each year we try and do as much fundraising for MacMillan as we can but we have never done anything like this.

'I think so far with all of our fundraising we have raised £1,000 which isn't bad to say we are such a small office.'
