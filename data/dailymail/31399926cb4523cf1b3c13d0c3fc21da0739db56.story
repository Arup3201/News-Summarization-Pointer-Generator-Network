A Republican dissident who has been cleared of five murder charges in 19 years was arrested yesterday over the assassination of Northern Ireland prison officer David Black.

Colin Duffy was one of two men held in the Lurgan area of County Armagh by detectives investigating the shooting of the 52-year-old father-of-two as he drove to work on Thursday morning.

Since 1993 Duffy, 44, has faced five murder charges, including the shooting of two uniformed British soldiers collecting pizzas outside their barracks in Antrim.

It comes a few months after Duffy was found not guilty of the murders of soldiers Patrick 
Azimkar and Mark Quinsey, who were gunned down in March 2009 at the 
gates of their barracks in Antrim.

Being questioned: Colin Duffy and another man were both detained by officers in Lurgan, Co Armagh, situated just a few miles from where Mr Black was assassinated

A leading Republican for more than 20 
years, Mr Duffy has been a target for loyalists. He has accused the 
police of waging a vendetta against him. The family of Mr Black have 
appealed for no retaliation ‘from any quarter’.

Yesterday, both Duffy and a 31-year-old man were detained by officers in Lurgan, Co Armagh, just miles from where Mr Black was assassinated.

Mr Black was on his way to work at the high security
Maghaberry Prison in County Antrim - where extremists have been involved 
in protests against jail conditions - when he was ambushed.

Several shots were fired at close range and Mr Black’s car veered into a ditch. He is believed to have died immediately.

It is understood his service stretched back as far as the 1981 IRA hunger strike inside the Maze prison.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers condemned the 'cowardly and evil' attack when she addressed the House of Commons this morning.

She told the Commons that yesterday's killing showed the threat posed by dissident republicans, adding: 'The
numbers involved in terrorism activities are small, but these groupings
have the capability and they have lethal intent.

'They can still ruin lives despite their lack of support in the community, so we remain vigilant in the face of this terrorist threat'. 

She added that the Government will do 'whatever we can' to help bring prison officer David Black's killers to justice.

And Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams today spoke out against the killing

He said: 'Whatever position individuals may hold on the efficacy or 
otherwise of armed struggle in the past, there is no rationale for it in
the present circumstances.

'There is no rationale now for the existence of armed groups or for 
carrying out armed actions in any part of this country. Those involved 
have no popular support or political strategy.

'There may be a small number of people who tolerate the existence of 
militarist groups or their violent actions or who provide shelter, 
resources or facilities to them. They need to reflect on what they are 
doing. These groups are not the IRA and nobody should be under any 
illusion about that.

'Those organisations that are politically associated with armed groups 
have failed to outline how these actions advance republican objectives.

'On the contrary, they play into the hands of those in the British 
system who are opposed to the peace process and to its potential for 
achieving a united Ireland.'

'Murdered': Police at the scene on the M1 in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, where prison officer David Black was shot dead by suspected dissident republicans as he drove along the motorway

'Hallmarks of dissident republicans': The gunman drew up alongside Mr Black's Audi and fired shots which sent him careering off the motorway and into a deep drainage ditch

His statement comes after widespread 
condemnation of the attack last night with First Minister Peter Robinson branding 
those responsible ‘flat earth fanatics’ and ‘deviants’. His deputy, 
Martin McGuinness, called it a ‘pointless and futile killing’.

Northern Ireland Chief Constable Matt 
Baggott said the attack – on the M1 between Portadown and Lurgan at 
7.30am yesterday morning – was ‘completely senseless’.

He added: ‘It demonstrates the 
recklessness and the ruthlessness of those who still oppose peace. We 
cannot allow these people to succeed and we won’t.’

David Cameron paid tribute to Mr Black and insisted that his killers would be brought to justice.

He said: 'First and foremost, this is
a dreadful tragedy for the family and friends of David Black, who has 
been so brutally murdered as he went about his work keeping the people 
of Northern Ireland safe. My heart goes out to them.

'The Government I lead will do whatever we can to help the PSNI bring the perpetrators to justice.

'These killers will not succeed in denying the people of Northern Ireland the peaceful, shared future they so desperately want.'

'This
has all the hallmarks of dissident republicans. This was just a brutal 
attack and we need the public's support to be able to solve it as 
quickly as possible.

'David was dedicated, a person keeping people safe, and we need to respect that and recognise that.'

Friends of Mr Black – a long-standing member of the Orange Order – also spoke of their revulsion at the killing.

Reverend Tom Greer, who spent most of 
the day at the Black family home near Cookstown, County Tyrone, said: 
‘David Black was a true gentleman… totally devoted to his wife, children
Kyle, 20, and Kyra, 17, and elderly parents who live close by. His wife
is absolutely broken and devastated.’

Mr Black was one of hundreds of officers who had applied for the Prison Service redundancy scheme.

There has been a general threat 
against prison officers for a number of years and it was clear from 
intelligence that some individual prison officers were being targeted.

Finlay Spratt, the head of the Prison 
Officers’ Association, criticised the security provisions offered to 
prison officers since the Troubles ended.

‘They have stripped away all 
the security around prison officers,’ he said. 'They treat us now as if we live in normal society.'

Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris
said the gunman who shot Mr Black was in a Toyota Camry with a Dublin registration.

'From that car, it appears that shots were fired at Mr Black,' he said.

'Almost immediately his car veered 
off the motorway and into a pretty deep drainage ditch. Mr Black appears
to have sustained very serious and probably fatal gunshot wounds.'

Mr Harris added: 'The motive behind this is sheer terror.'

'Motive of killing was sheer terror': Mr Black (not pictured) worked at top-security Maghaberry jail (above) near Lisburn, where dissident republicans have been involved in long-running protests against jail conditions

'A very good officer': Mr Black had more than 30 years' service in the Prison Service and was approaching retirement. Pictured is Maghaberry Prison

The shooting happened at the same time as a major security alert further along the 
motorway at a shopping centre at Sprucefield, near Lisburn, where bomb 
disposal experts were called in to check a car.

It is believed this vehicle might have been linked to the shooting, according to some sources.

'Dreadful tragedy': David Cameron has paid tribute to Mr Black and insisted the killers will be brought to justice

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa 
Villiers warned just two days ago that the threat from dissident republicans in Northern 
Ireland remained severe.

Forty-one dissident republicans are in
Maghaberry Prison. The majority are involved in a no-wash protest 
against the practice of strip searching at the jail. Some prisoners are 
not shaving, some are not washing and some are throwing human waste out 
on to the corridor rather than using toilets.

Since the Provisional IRA ceasefires 
of the 1990s, hard-liners have coalesced into various factions. Only 
months after the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 one 
of the radical groups – the Real IRA – killed 29 people in a bomb in 
Omagh.

In July this year the Real IRA and 
Republican Action Against Drugs announced they had joined forces along 
with a number of unaffiliated individuals and would now be known as the 
‘IRA’.

Security chiefs believe the new group was responsible for two failed bombing bids in Londonderry in September.

The last security force member  murdered was 25-year-old policeman Ronan Kerr in April 2011.

The recently qualified Roman Catholic 
recruit to the Police Service of Northern Ireland died in a booby trap 
car bomb attack at his home in Omagh.

The attack was claimed by individuals 
who said they were former members of the Provisional IRA. Two years 
earlier, two British soldiers and a policeman were murdered in separate 
attacks within 48 hours of each other.
