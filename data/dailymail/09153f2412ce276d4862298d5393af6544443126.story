Families have been cashing in their savings at the fastest rate in 40 years

Families have been cashing in their savings at the fastest rate in 40 years.

A total of £23billion was taken out of long-term savings accounts over the past 12 months – the equivalent of £900 a household.

The Bank of England figures suggest that record low interest rates have pushed people to spend their cash instead of saving it.

It is thought the increased withdrawals have been spent on consumer goods, boosting the economic recovery. The 4.7 per cent drop in the long-term savings is the biggest fall since the 1970s, according to analysis by Sky News.

Experts have raised questions about the sustainability of the economic recovery and will urge the Chancellor to encourage saving in his autumn statement. However, sources have suggested George Osborne may instead cap the maximum amount savers can put in to tax-free ISAs.

Former Downing Street adviser Ros Altmann said yesterday: ‘The figures are desperately worrying. People are stopping saving for the long term because all the policies of the last few years mean you would be a mug to save.

‘The problem is no economy can thrive in the long run without people saving. You can’t run it on borrowing and debt, you need to save and invest for the future. If you just withdraw money and spend you are talking about a recipe for long-term economic decline.’

Savings grew during the beginning of the credit crunch with £13.9billion being put away in the 12 months up to October 2009.

Deposits increased by £14.6billion the following year.

But interest rates plummeted below two per cent after the launch of the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending scheme last year.

Campaigners say the scheme, which offers cheap funding for high street banks in the hope they lend to businesses, discouraged banks from offering high interest rates to savers.

Simon Ward, an economist at City stockbroker Henderson Global Investors, said: ‘Consumer strength usually reflects increased borrowing but this hasn’t been the key factor recently.

‘Instead households have been running down their savings account balances, probably in reaction to the pathetic interest rates now on offer.

‘Increased spending is lifting growth and incomes, and money is flowing back to other households in a virtuous circle.’
