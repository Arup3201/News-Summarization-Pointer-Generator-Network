Police have launched a state-wide search for a high school teacher who disappeared just days before she was due to wed her partner of five years.

Stephanie Scott, 26, was last seen at a Woolworths supermarket at Leeton, 550km west of Sydney, on Easter Sunday afternoon, her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley told Fairfax.

'Police hold concerns for Ms Scott's welfare as her disappearance is reported to be out of character,' a statement from police said.

Desperate family and friends have flooded social media with dozens of messages about their search for the Leeton High School drama and English teacher, who was excited about her wedding day on Saturday.

'I spoke to her on Saturday night, about 10.30pm. I was in Canowindra, back at mum and dad's place, and she was in Leeton,' a distressed Mr Leeson-Woolley told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Everything seemed pretty fine.'

'One of her friends rang her on Easter Sunday and she was saying how she was excited and couldn't wait. That's the last time [anyone heard from her].'

Before going to the supermarket, Ms Scott is understood to have been seen at her workplace at about 11am, where her fiancé said she was organising some last second things before their honeymoon.

Police have asked anyone who might know of her whereabouts or have any information to come forward, adding that Ms Scott could be travelling in a red Mazda 3 sedan with registration BZ-19-CD

Mr Leeson-Woolley told the ABC that officers planned to investigate CCTV footage from Woolworths and look into his partner’s phone records and bank statements.

Ms Scott's last social media post shows her dressed in a veil and a bright pink 'bride to be' sash, on which she commented 'So excited, not long now xxx'.

Police have asked anyone who might know of her whereabouts or have any information to come forward, adding that Ms Scott could be travelling in a red Mazda 3 sedan with registration BZ-19-CD.
