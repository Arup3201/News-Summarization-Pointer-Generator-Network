A sample of a two-year-old boy's hair showed traces of cocaine, heroin and methadone, likely to have been ingested by the toddler in the last four months of his life, a court has heard.

The tests were done on a sample of Riley Pettipierre's hair after he died from allegedly drinking his mother's methadone.

His parents Sally Dent, 33, and Shaun Binfield, 45, from Belper, Derby, both deny the manslaughter of their son as well as cruelty to a person under 16.

Consultant forensic toxicologist Julie Evans told the trial at Nottingham Crown Court that quantities of heroin, methadone and cocaine were found in a hair sample that represented a minimum of the last four months of the child's life.

She said the amounts revealed by the tests indicated the drugs had been through the boy's body rather than deposited on his hair.

She said she could not say by what means the drugs had got into the child's body.

Simon Clarke, for Dent, proposed that Riley had ingested the drugs by putting contaminated items in his mouth, as well as through close contact with his mother.

Mr Clarke said: 'Sally Dent was in the habit of smoking her crack cocaine and heroin in her kitchen, with the door and window closed.'

Mrs Evans accepted that residue from the drugs would have landed on surfaces, including cupboard handles and crockery, as well as on Dent.

She said the mechanism described by Mr Clarke could give 'measurable amounts' in the hair but, in her opinion, not the levels that were detected in Riley's case.

She said: 'Theoretically, that is possible. It would require a high degree of contamination of the home environment.'

She said that the residue could have been removed by washing the surface.

She also told the court that the amounts of drugs ingested, indicated by the levels of the substances in his hair, would have been 'capable of causing a reaction within the body'.

Mrs Evans said that the cocaine, a stimulant, could have caused the boy's heart rate to increase, as well as cause vomiting and diarrhoea, whereas the heroin and methadone were depressants and could have slowed the toddler's heart and breathing rates.

Previously, the jury was told that Dent was on a methadone treatment programme.

It is alleged that Riley drank some methadone that Dent had poured into a child's beaker, intended for her own use, and put on top of a chest of drawers.

Opening her prosecution case, Yvonne Coen QC told a jury at Nottingham Crown Court that Dent, who repeatedly dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock, was struggling to get over a heroin habit.

Dent has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit, Ms Coen told the court.

A child's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ bedroom where he also slept, so it would be ‘within easy reach’ of his mother, Ms Coen alleged.

Dent awoke to find Riley unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on March 13 last year.

She described her son to police as ‘a gorgeous little boy’ and a ‘loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief’, the court heard.

‘Not only would (the beaker) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him,’ she said.

It was ‘grave negligence’ by his parents to leave the dangerous drug in a beaker, which the toddler would have thought was juice, the prosecutor told the court.

Paramedics arrived to find Riley lifeless. His heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue, Ms Coen told the court. The toddler was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arriving.

Friends and family of the couple wept in the dock as Ms Coen told the jury that post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal.

He is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone, the court heard.

The couple originally told officers that Riley must have climbed on top of a wardrobe in the bedroom where the methadone was usually stored in a locked wooden box, Ms Coen told the court.

She claims that Binfield, who was watching television in the other room on the morning of the incident, let Riley go back into the bedroom unsupervised, knowing that methadone was within his reach and knowing that Dent was sleeping off drugs she had taken the night before.
