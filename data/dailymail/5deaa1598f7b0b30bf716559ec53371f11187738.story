A foreign nurse who force-fed her baby to death cannot be deported because it would breach her right to a family life.

The Ghanaian woman won her fight to stay in Britain under controversial human rights laws.

And even though the 33-year-old was named in the widely-reported court case that saw her jailed for causing the baby’s death, she has now been granted anonymity.

The woman, who can only be referred to as GHA has been granted lifetime anonymity as well as leave to remain in the UK unconditionally (picture posed by model)

Having served her three-year sentence, she has been free since April last year to look after her three surviving children.

Last night one MP said the situation was ‘perverse’ and called the immigration tribunal’s ruling ‘warped’. Home Secretary Theresa May has made repeated attempts to remove the woman, who can be referred to only as GHA.

The case will again raise questions about the use of the European Convention on Human Rights to protect criminals. The Home Office said the ruling was ‘disappointing’.

The nurse, who came to the UK on a student visa in 2000, used a small milk jug to tip baby rice African corn porridge and chicken soup into her child’s mouth.

GHA’s legal victory – using Article 8 of the European Convention – means that she has been allowed to remain in the UK unconditionally with her family and been granted lifetime anonymity.

Home Secretary Theresa May made several attempts to deport the woman, who can only be referred to as GHA, before today's ruling which was described as 'perverse' by a Conservative back bencher

Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who has called for the reining-in of human rights laws, said: ‘Many people will look at this case, a mother jailed for force-feeding her baby and feel it reflects the warped nature of our human rights laws today.

‘The argument is that she is being separated from her kids but not only was she separated from them in prison but there were also care proceedings brought against her.

'The children have also spent periods of time in Ghana so the arguments for not deporting her fall away. It shows how the judges have expanded and shifted the goalposts from human rights in a way that is pretty arbitrary and perverse.

‘It does not reflect anything written into the ECHR and certainly not anything Parliament has agreed to.

‘Article 8 is being used by convicted, jailed criminals to stay in this country. This isn’t the only case. I actually think the article can be a threat to family life, in particular vulnerable children and partners.’

He said that almost 90 per cent of successful deportation appeals are using Article 8 – up to 400 cases a year: ‘Article 8 is the single biggest problem for deporting a serious foreign criminal and this is something that has only really developed in the last seven years. What will it be like in another seven? It could be almost impossible to deport someone.’

Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said that the use of human rights law to protect the nurse was ‘crazy’. He added: ‘The ECHR was never intended to protect people who carry out terrible crimes from being sent back to their own country.’

The three-year sentence handed to GHA at the trial in 2011 meant that under Home Office rules she could be considered for automatic deportation.

But attempts to deport her following her release from prison were rejected after she appealed and won her case at a lower immigration tribunal in February.

When Mrs May launched an appeal to overturn the decision at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber last month, the earlier decision was upheld.

A social services report deemed her children were under ‘no significant risk of harm’ and described the family as a ‘close, committed unit with strong cultural and religious beliefs’. Her partner was granted custody of the three children following care proceedings in 2010 and the family has lived in a three-bed London home since GHA’s release.

During her trial it emerged that GHA, who had already applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK when her child died, had paid ‘little attention’ to social services who had been involved with the family.

The Home Office said it was seeking to appeal against the tribunal’s decision.

It added: ‘Through the recently passed Immigration Act, we are making it easier to remove people from the UK and harder for individuals to prolong their stay with spurious appeals, by cutting the number of appeal rights from 17 to four.

‘It will also ensure that judges deal with Article 8 claims in the right way — making clear the right to a family life is not regarded as absolute and unqualified.’
