A previously unseen
photograph of Winston Churchill on a horse following his daring escape from a prison
camp during the Boer War has emerged for sale.

Sitting
astride his grey mount in 1899, the 26-year-old future Prime Minister is shown
wearing a suit and tie and has on a wide-brimmed hat.

He has a
notably slim figure after his 'sixty hours of misery' trying to find
his way back to British lines.

He had
gone to South Africa in 1898 as a newspaper war correspondent and was captured
in November the following year.

Winston Churchill after his Boer War prison camp escape: Sitting astride his grey mount in 1899, the 26-year-old future Prime Minister is shown wearing a suit and tie and has on a wide-brimmed hat in this never-before-seen photograph

The back of the photo reads 'Winston Churchill after escape'. The photo has been put up for sale by the descendants of Arthur Knight, a trained photographer who was the son of pioneer diamond miner William Knight

He was
part of a scouting expedition on an armoured train when it was attacked by the
enemy.

Churchill's
heroics during the ambush led to speculation that he would receive the
Victoria Cross, although this never happened.

He was
taken to a prison camp in Pretoria but a month later he made his escape and
travelled 300 miles to safety.

He became
a national hero, but it was not enough for Churchill who then joined the army
and helped relieve the British at the Siege of Ladysmith and then take
Pretoria.

This
vintage photograph is not recognised by any experts in the field and is
expected to make hundreds of pounds when it goes under the hammer at auction.

It has
been consigned for sale by the descendants of Arthur Knight, a trained
photographer who was the son of pioneer diamond miner William Knight.

When Churchill escaped from the PoW camp, a wanted poster was issued, offering £25 for the young war correspondent's recapture.

The Boer authorities distributed a description of him, noting that he could not speak a word of Dutch.

Despite this, he made it to safety.

Boer commander PJ Joubert, who had imprisoned Churchill two months earlier, said: 'He is just n'klein koerant-skrywertjie' - 'he's just a little newspaper man'.

Soon after gaining his freedom, Churchill joined the South African Light Horse, an irregular cavalry unit which fought his former captors.

For the next few months, he stayed on in South Africa as a soldier/correspondent, thrilling readers with his reportage and slow march to victory.

Arthur
trained as a photographer with David Barnett of Johannesburg and it is likely
that this shot of Churchill was taken either by Barnett or by Arthur Knight
himself.

It shows
Churchill surrounded by men of The South African Light Horse Regiment and on
the back of the photo it says 'Winston Churchill after Escape'.

Andrew Marlborough, from Duke's of Dorchester in Dorset, which is selling the
picture, said: 'This could be a major find.

'Our
research so far suggests that this is an unrecorded photo. It shows him astride
his grey horse surrounded by troops.

'The
troops are from the South African Light Horse Regiment, which was who Churchill
was with in his role as a newspaper correspondent.

'This
could be taken very shortly after his escape and is a really exciting find.

'It
has come from the direct descendant of Arthur Knight, who was the son of
William Knight a diamond mining pioneer and the founder of Johannesburg.

'Arthur
Knight trained as a photographer with David Barnett who took many official
photographs of the war.

'This
photograph is likely to have been taken by Arthur Knight or David Barnett and
is part of a large archive from the same source.

'These
include images of Lord Kitchener, General Christiaan De Wet, President Paul
Kruger, as well as views on London and Brighton in the late 19th and early 20th
century.'

During the second Boer War that started in October 1899 between
Britain the the Boer Republics, Churchill obtained a commission to act as a war
correspondent.

He had
recently failed to be elected to the house of commons and went to South Africa
to report for the Morning Post on £250 a month.

In a
dispatch, Churchill told of his escape and wrote: 'I therefore resolved to
escape, and the same night I left the State School's prison, in Pretoria by
climbing the wall when the sentries' backs were turned momentarily.'

He
told how he walked through the town 'without disguise' and met many 'burghers' then managed to board a train and hid under coal sacks.

He then
told how he jumped from the train and followed the railway by night, avoiding
bridges and crossings.

He boarded
another train and despite it being searched by Boers he avoided detection.

He
concluded: 'After sixty hours of misery I came safely here. I am very
weak, but am free.

'I
have lost many pounds in weight, but am light in heart.' The sale is on
April 12.

Shortly after arriving, Churchill joined a scouting expedition in an armoured train, leading to his capture and imprisonment in a PoW camp in Pretoria, but he escaped and wrote about his exploits for the Morning Post
