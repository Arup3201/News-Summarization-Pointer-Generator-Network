A 20-year-old cyclist bled to death 24 hours after he was sent home from an understaffed hospital with a ruptured spleen, an inquest heard today.

John Moore-Robinson died on 2 April 2006 - a day after he was discharged from scandal-hit Stafford Hospital by Dr Girish Kumar Sharma.

He was left waiting for treatment at the A&E department for 70 minutes despite the ambulance crew saying his condition was 'life-threatening' after a mountain biking accident in Cannock Chase.

The telecommunications engineer was diagnosed with bruised ribs and told he could leave, but collapsed at his home in Sileby, Leicester, less than 24 hours later.

Despite being rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary he died a short time later, the inquest at Leicester Coroners Court heard.

Matron Jacqueline Keogh, who was not working at Stafford Hospital at the time but has investigated Mr Moore-Robinson's treatment, told the hearing that his priority should have been more urgent.

She said: 'The ambulance report notes Mr Moore-Robinson was complaining of respiratory problems. He was pale and fully conscious.

'The crew evaluated his condition as life-threatening. When they arrived at the hospital at 15.55, his priority was indicated as intermediate.

'The immediate nurses checked his vital signs. They took Mr Moore-Robinson's heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor Sharma examined him at 17.35.

'I am aware that Mr Moore-Robinson's cause of death was a ruptured spleen. I would have insisted Mr Moore-Robinson's priority to have been more urgent.

'I would expect that a patient of this mechanism of injury could have been safely managed better.

'During the initial period of time this patient was seen, between 16.00 and 19.20, we had 19 major patients and 90 minors.

'If a patient was well enough to go home, he should have been advised not to be alone during the night.

'The nurses should have informed the nurse in charge that he should not have been discharged.

Staff nurse Mark Saville told the inquest that when he started working at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust in 2006, the hospital was  short-staffed

In 2009, it emerged hundreds of patients could have died unnecessarily because of shocking levels of care in the Stafford Hospital's A&E department

'Mr Moore-Robinson should have been allocated a more senior doctor.'

Dr Sharma told the inquest he had only been working in the A&E department for four months when he examined Mr Moore-Robinson.

He said: 'I was not aware of any special mention of the paramedic's comments only the condition being life-threatening.

'The priority of the patient was not determined by which cubical they were allocated, unless a specific concern was raised.

'It was not satisfactory for a one hour and 10 minute wait. If the nurse in charge had specifically said 'this person needs to be seen urgently', they would have been seen to. I would have expected to have been directly informed.

'Mr Moore-Robinson's main concern was respiratory. I think I carried out a full examination.'

'I do not clearly remember when he first came in.'

Mr Moore-Robinson's heart pulse rate fluctuated between 104 beats per minute to 84 beats per minute during the two hours he was in A&E.

In reference to the pulse rate, Dr Sharma said: 'What appeared normal to me, looking back in hindsight, was not normal.

'Obviously he was in a bit of pain but nothing to suggest more than acute distress during examination.'

An inquest in 2007 recorded a narrative verdict, which is when the cause of death is not attributed to a named individual.

But his parents Frank and Janet, both 61 and from Coalville, Leicester, campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light.

In April this year Leicestershire Coroner Catherine Mason was forced to adjourn the hearing so new witnesses could be traced.

The inquest today heard the A&E department had been seriously understaffed.

Staff nurse Mark Saville told the inquest: 'When I started working in the trust in 2006, we were short-staffed.

'We only had three nurses in majors on 1 April 2006. Since then the position has improved significantly.

'We also had a lot of very sick patients in, who if this happened now, would be in special units in Wolverhampton or Stoke.

'Checks on patients should be done as soon as possible and on a regular basis. The recognised standard for major injury patients is one every hour.

'Any decisions taken to move patients from the department were taken by management.'
