Wayne Rooney has become the first Premier League footballer to reach 10 million followers on social networking site Twitter. 

The Manchester United and England captain, who is currently serving a three-match ban after being sent off against West Ham last week, passed the milestone on Monday morning and tweeted his followers to thank them.

'Reached 10 million followers,' Rooney tweeted. 'Thanks to all my fans around the world.'
