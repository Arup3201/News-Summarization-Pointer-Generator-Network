The widow of an Army veteran was forced to call in the bomb squad after finding four live hand grenades her late husband had stashed in their attic.

Caroline Cyganiak had been going through her late husband Fabian's military gear in the attic of their home when she found the decades-old hand grenades in an ammo tin.

'It scared the living daylights out of me,' she told Fox 6 Now. 'I didn't know if they could explode or not.'

After she dialled 911, police in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, called in the bomb squad from the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office who found that the anti-personnel bombs were not only live, but also unstable.

Experts safely removed the grenades from Mrs Cyganiak's home but, such was the danger, they judged that the weapons had to be destroyed immediately before any accidents could happen.

They rushed the grenades to a remote spot that night and blew them up in two controlled explosions, which were so loud they led to dozens of emergency calls from frightened people nearby.

Mrs Cyganiak had found the hand grenades while going through her husband's old Army uniforms, a job the grieving widow had been putting off since he passed away last year.

She said that they had been there for about 42 years.

Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said that if the grenades had exploded the resulting blast would have been disastrous.

'I’m sure that they would have damaged that house extensively and probably injured anyone within a radius. That’s what they’re meant to do. They are weapons of war,' he said.

Mrs Cyganiak said her husband was 'proud' of his time in the military, but she has nevertheless been left baffled as to why he decided to keep so much explosive ordinance among his mementoes.

'Today I went to the cemetery and I really reamed him out,' she chuckled.
