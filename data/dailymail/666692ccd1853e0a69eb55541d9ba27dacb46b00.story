Many can't bark because they had their vocal cords removed.

They have spent their lives as guinea pigs in cages and had never

And none were expected to survive.

However a non-profit organization in California has ensured that over 300 beagles have been given a new - and real - life after fighting to have them released from research labs that would have killed them, either through experiments or euthanasia, according to CBS SF Bay Area.

Trapped: Video taken undercover by PETA shows the treatment of some dogs used in lab testing

Caged: The beagles are used in testing for medicines and household products

Shocking: The dogs are confined in cages in the labs and rarely, if ever, see sunlight

Horrible: This PETA video, obtained by CBS, shows a lab worker force-feeding a dog the drug OxyContin 

Heartbreaking: It is not illegal to experiment on animals, however lab testing is overlooked by the USDA

The Beagle Freedom Project, based in Los Angeles, has targeted four companies around the Bay Area - Emeeryville, Hercules, Menlo Park and San Carlos - which have not been named.

The companies use the dogs to test pharmaceuticals and household chemicals.

A video previously released by PETA showed a beagle being force-fed prescription painkiller Oxycontin, also known as 'Hillbilly heroin'.

Beagles are often used in the experiments because they are gentle, kind-natured animals.

'I think it's really important to note that there is no experiment on dogs that is illegal,' Kathy Guillermo, senior VP of PETA, told CBS.

'Experiments have to be approved by committees within a lab, but nothing is against the law, so they are put through all kinds of cruelty.'

However the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) animal testing.

'These dogs have spent their lives in a cage,' Shannon Keith, president and founder of the Beagle Freedom Project, told CBS.

'We were told directly by the people in the lab that they have never been outside, that they had never seen sunlight, that they had never had a toy.'

Free at last: The Beagle Freedom Project works to get the dogs out of labs and into good homes

Playing: Most of the dogs have not ever had toys before

Charity: The Beagle Freedom Project is a mission to rescue beagles used in animal experimentation in research laboratories

One of the companies, Novartis Diagnostics, which develops blood transfusion medicine, released a statement over their animal testing.

'As a part of the research process, beagles are used to evaluate potential new medicines,' the statement said.

'Our facility has a long-standing rehoming program that has successfully placed more than 200 dogs with loving families.'

The Beagle Freedom Project, which has freed over 300 dogs since starting out in 2010, finds loving homes for the dogs once they are freed.

Breaking the habit: Once becoming pets, the beagles take time to adjust to life outside the cage

Imprinted: Lab dogs are usually given tattoos on the inside of their ears as identification 

Best friends: This beagle, Riley, had to learn how to play with another dog, which he hadn't done before

Suzanne Lane adopted one of the dogs, Riley, for her family, but said it took him quite a while to adjust to life outside of the lab.

Besides a tattoo on his ear - which are put on all lab dogs - Riley would often lie down on the sidewalk while out for a walk, because he wasn't used to being outside a cage.

He also had to learn to play with other dogs.

'He's really brought a lot of positive and happiness to our family,' Mrs Lane said.
