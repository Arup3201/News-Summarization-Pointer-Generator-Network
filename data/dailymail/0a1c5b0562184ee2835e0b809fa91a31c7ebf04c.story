Authorities called off the search for three ranchers today, who disappeared after a huge mudslide in a remote part of western Colorado.

Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey said the slide remained too unstable to continue looking for the men, identified as Clancy Nichols, 51, a county road and bridge employee; Danny Nichols, 24, Clancy Nichols' son; and Wes Hawkins, 46.

The three men were checking on problems with an irrigation ditch caused by an initial slide Sunday when a second, much larger slide hit. Authorities say the slide is a half-mile long and about three miles long.

Hilkey said another slide is still possible.

'We're
 not able to do what we would like to do,' the sheriff said. 'What we 
would like to do is have every inch of this covered with people if we 
could. But we don't want to create any more of a tragedy than we already
 have.'

The three men - a county road worker, his son and another man - were all from the close-knit town of Collbran.

They volunteered to investigate when a rancher noticed his irrigation ditch stopped running.

The smaller mudslide was found to be to blame for the water cutoff.

When the men went to check on the damage, a huge chunk of the ridge sheared off, likely overwhelming them.

Hilkey has said the slide was most likely triggered by runoff from Grand Mesa following two days of strong rain.

No
 structures or roads were affected in the remote area, about an hour 
east of Grand Junction. A drone was used to try to detect heat sources 
from the missing near the edge of Grand Mesa, one of the world's highest
 flat topped mountains.

The 
Mesa County Sheriff's Office identified the missing men and Clancy 
Nichols' brother, Bill, says he's holding out hope they survived the 
slide.

'We're praying for 
their safety', he told KUSA-TV. 'We're praying for the safe return of 
the family members of Wes' family and for Clancy and Danny to come 
back.'

Hawkins' cousin, Bill
 Clark, said yesterday he went along with Clancy and Danny Nichols to 
check on why an irrigation ditch had stopped flowing because he works 
for an area water district. He said he has a family and young children.

Clark,
 who visited the canyon where the slide struck, said it was completely 
filled with mud. He said the slide struck with so much force that some 
also spilled over into the neighboring draw.

'I've never seen so much earth move like that in my life,' he said.

From
 a distance of about 10 miles, the slide looked like a funnel, narrowing
 into a culvert below. It cut a giant channel through trees. The creek 
that once gradually flowed down the ridge now spurted down like a 
waterfall. Roads in the area, where some cattle grazed, were muddy from 
rain.

'How in the devil could this happen?' said Collbran resident Lloyd Power, gazing out at the slide.

While
 the surrounding area is popular place for fishing, hiking and camping, 
the slide hit on land with an access gate that isn't open to the public.
 No one else is believed missing and no homes were damaged.

Energy
 companies were monitoring oil and gas wells in the area, part of the 
productive Piceance Basin, but so far the mud has only come up to the 
edge of one pad operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. The three wells 
there have been shut down, said David Ludlam, executive director of the 
West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group.

Hilkey
 said he'd received a telephone call from authorities in Washington 
state, where a March 22 landslide swept a square mile of dirt, sand and 
silt through a neighborhood in Oso, about an hour northeast of Seattle. 
That slide leveled homes and killed at least 43 people.

The
 Mesa County sheriff's department estimated the slide is about 4 miles 
long, 2 miles wide and about 250 feet deep in many places.

'This slide is unbelievably big,' Mesa County Lt. Phil Stratton said.

The site is in a
 rural part of the county and there were no reports of any structures 
damaged or major roads affected, McCammon said.

A
 unified incident command was established between Plateau Valley 
Fire Department and the Mesa sheriff, to handle the slide and search for
 the people possibly caught in it.

Authorities said the heavy rains that fell over the weekend contributed to the slide.
