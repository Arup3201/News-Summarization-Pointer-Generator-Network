Up close and personal, an American alligator with jaws open wide proudly displays rows of rough edged teeth and spotted pink tongue.

The half-submerged reptile glows in bright yellow - caused by the strong reflection of fresh grass shoots on the surface of the clear water.

Brave photographer Masa Ushioda captured the shots of this wild gator in vast marsh land in the Everglades National Park, in Florida, USA.

After waiting weeks for storm clouds to disperse and murky water to clear, the 43-year-old then had to navigate a huge number of waterways.

He said: ‘Fortunately I had an American Indian lady to guide and assist. She could imitate the quacking and squeaking sound of alligators and this immediately attracted the gators - so well in fact it created another problem.

‘Since her sound gathered all of the alligators nearby, suddenly this ten-foot reptile chased other alligators 50 yards to the right and 100 yards to the left.

‘Sometimes it submerged and attacked other alligators from down below by headbutting.

‘All I could do was wait - for the alligator and then for the light.’

Despite the threat of other gators invading on this reptile's territory, Masa wanted to get as close as possible.

After trying to swim with the creature, the 43-year-old decided the best way to get his under-over water shots was to set up a pole cam on higher ground.

Unfazed by its fierce reputation, Masa said: ‘Alligators in the wild are just as much afraid of humans as we are of them.

‘They are particularly sensitive to vibrations and movement, so I have to be absolutely quiet and still like a rock to get the alligator to come close.

‘This gator was calm as long as I didn't move and agitate him.’

Seemingly smiling with water bubbles rising from its jaws, the alligator looks almost as happy as Masa to be caught on camera.

The Tokyo-born-and-raised photographer admits the shoot was immensely rewarding.

He said: ‘Bright sunlight and blue sky were critical elements in this picture - in addition to getting a wild 10-foot alligator in the middle of the viewfinder with a perfect angle.

‘One day the weather won't cooperate. On the other day, alligators won't.

‘Extreme patience is required but it was so rewarding.’

The American alligator, sometimes referred to colloquially as a gator or an alligator, is a large crocodilian reptile endemic to the southeastern United States.

It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae; it is larger than the other extant alligator species, the Chinese alligator.

Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 4.6 metres (11 to 15 foot) in length, and can weigh 453 kg (999 lb). Females are smaller, measuring around 3 metres (9.8 foot).

The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to North Carolina.

It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical climates.

Alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. They also play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms.

Throughout the year, but especially during the breeding season, alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates.

Historically, hunting has decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The species is the official state reptile of three American states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
