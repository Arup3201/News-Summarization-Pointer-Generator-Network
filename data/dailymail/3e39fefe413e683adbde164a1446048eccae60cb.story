Foreigners and immigrants who fail a residency test are to be barred from receiving legal aid for civil court cases.

The ban would include claims made under human rights and health and safety laws which, according to a report published yesterday, threaten to undermine British military operations.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Daily Mail he had decided to press ahead with a ban on non-Britons using public money to pay for civil claims. It will take effect early next year.

Legal aid: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling decided to push ahead with the ban

The decision is the latest in a series of Government measures designed to stop Britain being seen as a  ‘soft touch’.

Migrants will not be able to obtain the funding until they have lived legally in Britain for at least a year. The Government aims to cut the £1.7billion legal aid bill by around £300million.

The report, by the Policy Exchange think tank, warned of a rise in claims against the government.

Author Tom Tugendhat, a former assistant to the Chief of the Defence Staff, said human rights claims in the past decade have ‘undone safeguards Parliament drew up to ensure military commanders have the  freedom … to make vital decisions on the ground’.

The report highlights cases in which foreign detainees argued  their human rights were breached because they were shouted at during interrogation. Such claims would not be funded by legal aid under the new ban.

The Justice Secretary said: ‘I am very firmly of the belief that, in principle, individuals should have a strong connection to the UK in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme.’
