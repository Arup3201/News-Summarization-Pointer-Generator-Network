Instagram has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt.

The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend.

Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.

Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.

However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.

The favorites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total.

Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. ‘We're going to other regions soon, but are starting with handful of countries to make sure we can scale the experience,’ an Instagram spokesman told The Verge.

‘Instagram has 65 percent of its users overseas, so an international launch, while different, is actually not all that out of order with what we do.’

The Instagram representative elaborated that the three countries were selected not only because of their geographical diversity, but also for their tight-knit communities. 

The app’s launch follows Facebook’s recent foray into ephemeral messaging with Slingshot. Slingshot performs many of the same functions as Bolt (and even includes an identical text editor), however it encourages the user to share photos and videos with many people, not just a single contact.

Slingshot also forces you to send a photo before you can before you can view the one you’ve just received.

Instagram’s current private sharing mechanism, Instagram Direct, allows for the permanent exchange of photos with up to 15 people at a time.

Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.

The features is regularly used by around 45 million users, however it has failed to catch on the way more standalone messaging apps have.

Some experts say that Bolt is actually an attempt to mirror Taptalk, yet another ephemeral messaging service.

The Berlin-based company provides a Snapchat-like interface but without the signature countdown clock, user profiles or navigation buttons.

In May, Snapchat unveiled its own in-app instant messaging and video chat service.

In February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat.

At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other.

This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service.

Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumors that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client.

Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself.

Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December.

In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger.

Both Apple and Facebook have released similar ephemeral messaging services in attempt to capitalize on Snapchat's runaway success.

Apple also added the ability to send self-destructing audio and video messages via iMessage.

Some say Bolt’s functionality is also similar to Mirage, a one tap messaging app by the makers of Yo.

Facebook and Instagram both hope that Bolt will become more successful than Facebook’s previous ill-fated Snapchat clone, Poke.

Instagram plans to promote Bolt at the top of every user's Instagram feed.

Instagram is already facing problems with its Bolt app with some users accusing the firm of stealing the logo from a San Francisco-based charity called Causes.

The app is already facing some problems, however. Andrew Benton, CEO of a free calling app named Bolt has already written a blog post asking Instagram to please consider another name for its app.

‘There is already confusion in the market… Our users have reached out to us, wondering whether we've been acquired or are possibly providing the underlying technology behind your Bolt app. People are searching for Bolt in the Play Store and downloading our app thinking it’s yours,’ he wrote.

Facebook and Instagram have also been accused of ripping off the logo for Causes, a charity organization.

Regardless, users in the US are already clamoring to get their hands on the service. ‘ugh i want to try bolt but it’s not available in the US,’ Twitter user @samsheffer posted, ‘now i know how it feels’.
