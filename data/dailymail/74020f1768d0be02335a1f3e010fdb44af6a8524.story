The dingo has been known as Australia’s native dog since the arrival of westerners more than 200 years ago.

But now the country has redefined a wildlife icon as scientists have said that the dingo is a unique species and not just a common mutt.

A new study has resurrected the species name Canis dingo, which was first mentioned by a German naturalist called Friedrich Meyer in 1793.

Distinctive: The dingo is a unique species and not a common mutt, scientists have said. The dingo will now officially use its species name Canis dingo, which was first mentioned by a German naturalist called Friedrich Meyer in 1793

‘The dingo is distinct from what we describe as a domestic dog; it's a distinct form of canid,’ said Mike Letnic, a University of New South Wales (UNSW) ecologist.

Confusion over whether or not the dingo was a distinct species partly originates from the scientific classification of the Australian dingo, which was based on a simple drawing and description in the journal of Australia’s first governor, Arthur Phillip, without reference to a physical specimen.

To find a specimen of a dingo unlikely to have cross-bred with domestic dogs, the researchers searched museum collections in Europe, Australia and America that contained specimens known or likely to pre-date 1900.

They examined 69 skull specimens and six skin specimens to create a benchmark description of the dingo, whose defining physical features include a relatively broad head with a long snout, as well as erect ears and a bushy tail. The description features in a study published in the Journal of Zoology.

It is thought that dingoes were introduced to Australia between three and five thousand years ago, with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from East Asian domestic dogs. The animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after European settlement. An Aboriginal artist is pictured with a painting of a dingo

‘Now any wild canid – dingo, dog, or hybrid of the two – can be judged against that classification,’ says Dr Matthew Crowther, lead author of the study, from the University of Sydney’s School of Biological Sciences.

‘We can also conclusively say that the dingo is a distinctive Australian wild canid or member of the dog family in its own right, separate from dogs and wolves. The appropriate scientific classification is Canis dingo, as they appear not to be descended from wolves, are distinct from dogs and are not a subspecies,’ he said.

Many Australians like to think that dingoes are always yellow, but Dr Letnic said: ‘One of our insights is that coat colour does not define an animal as a dingo, dog or a hybrid. We found that dingoes can be tan, dark, black and tan, white, or can have the sable coloration typical of German Shepherd dogs.'

Dingoes are Australia’s largest land predator and play an important role in regulating populations of species such as kangaroos, wallabies and invasive red foxes.

The scientists believe that a clearer understanding of dingo numbers, based on the clearer identification, will improve understanding of their role in biodiversity.

Dr Crowther said: ‘Distinguishing dingoes from their hybrids (cross-breeds) with feral dogs is a practical concern.

Current policies in parts of Australia support the conservation of dingoes but the extermination of “dingo-dogs,” which are considered a major pest because they kill livestock.’

It is thought that dingoes were introduced to Australia between three and five thousand years ago, with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from east Asian domestic dogs.

The animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after European settlement.

‘That made distinguishing dingoes from dogs problematic, as the DNA tests and analyses of their physical structure were based on dingoes whose ancestry was not known. They were either captive animals or wild animals of uncertain ancestry,’ Dr Crowther explained.

Scientists will use the clearer classification to differentiate between pure dingoes, which are protected and feral dogs, which are not
