Hollywood star Brad Pitt’s Hurricane Katrina charity is coming under fire after more than two dozen homes that his organization built are rotting.

The charity, Make It Right New Orleans, built the homes in the devastated Ninth Ward after the 2005 natural disaster that killed more than 1,800 people.

Homeowners have complained that the wood cannot withstand the humid climate of the city and therefore are rotting and growing fungus.

‘It turned grey and it was also black,’ Make It Right home-owner Nola Verrett told Radar Online.

The charity has blamed the wood company TimberSIL for providing the lumber, which is a non-burning glass-and-wood blend and had been guaranteed for 40 years.

‘It was unable to withstand moisture, which is obviously a big problem in New Orleans,’ Make It Right representative, Taylor Royle, told the New Orleans Advocate, according to Radar.

It will now cost $150,000 to replace all the wood.

Pitt’s charity is now reportedly considering legal action against the wood company.

Homeowner Verret says the wood on her home has already been replaced with yellow pine.

‘It didn’t take no time at all,’ said Verrett, who has been living in the home for just over four years.

‘It’s just like they said. If something’s wrong, they make it right. We are very happy with our Make It Right home.’

Not everyone is just as happy, however.

Homeowner, Gloria Guy, said her home had not been reconstructed yet.

‘They replaced a lot of houses but they ain’t replaced mine. They’re supposed to come pretty soon and do it.”

Around 30 homes will require reconstruction.

Pitt has said he gets ‘far too much credit’ for the charity’s rebuilding efforts, even though he is the poster boy, according to Radar Online.
