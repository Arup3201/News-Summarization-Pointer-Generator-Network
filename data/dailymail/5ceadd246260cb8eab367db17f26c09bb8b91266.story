Arrest: The alleged accomplice of spy Anna Chapman (pictured) was arrested in Holland

An alleged accomplice to former KGB sex-sting spy Anna Chapman has been arrested in Holland after passing on sensitive German government documents.

Identified only as Raymond P., aged 60, the man was targeted by the German Federal Prosecutor's Office.

German media reported today he passed on some 450 secret files to a couple linked to Chapman who was expelled from America two years ago.

He is now in custody and refusing to speak to investigators.

News magazine Focus said the man, a Dutch diplomat, gave the paperwork to a couple arrested in the German university city of Marburg in October last year who belonged to the same espionage network as Chapman and were provided with false identity papers by their Moscow controllers.

Chapman became known as the 'sexpot spy' because she used her feminine charms to try to entrap targets and gain vital information from them.

Born Anna Vasil’yevna Kushchyenko, Miss Chapman adopted her Anglophone surname after marrying British former public schoolboy Alex Chapman - who she claims to have fallen for because he looked like Liam Gallagher.

In a documentary broadcast in April this year FBI counter-intelligence chief Frank Figliuzzi claimed the glamorous Russian agent got close enough to 'disturb' U.S. spy catchers.

He said the fear that Miss Chapman was close to seducing a sitting member of the Obama administration spurred agents to swoop on the 10-strong spy ring of which she was a part.

Mr Figliuzzi told the Channel 4 documentary the auburn-haired spy got 'closer and closer to higher and higher ranking leadership... she got close enough to disturb us.'

Raymond P., say prosecutors, leaked sensitive documents to Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag in Marburg.

Both held Austrian passports but are thought to be South American-born.

The couple were both arrested in October last year.

It is understood they were turned in to the authorities by the same double agent who last year led the FBI to uncover the Chapman ring of ‘deep cover’ Russian spies in the United States.

According to the Moscow Times, the Anschlags maintained contact with the US operatives, including the flame-haired Chapman who has become a TV celebrity following her return to Russia in a spy exchange.

Heidrun Anschlag was reportedly listening to encrypted radio messages from Moscow when police commandos entered her home.
