A late bid by Queens Park Rangers to sign West Ham winger Matt Jarvis fell through due to Premier League rules on Monday night.

Rangers held talks over a loan deal for the 28-year-old, who has struggled for first-team football this season due to injuries and a loss of form.

QPR wanted to sign winger Matt Jarvis from West Ham on deadline day

The transfer was complicated by QPR having taken forward Mauro Zarate  on loan from West Ham last month.

Premier League clubs are only allowed to have one player on loan from another Premier League club so QPR wanted to send Zarate back to Upton Park.

It was reported that the Premier League initially backed the proposal but the deal fell through when it became clear that a a temporary transfer must be from one transfer window to the next.

QPR were unable to sign Jarvis because they already Mauro Zarate on loan from West Ham

QPR were keen for Zarate to return to West Ham and considered taking Carlton Cole on loan instead

There were also reports that QPR asked for special dispensation to sign Jarvis and that was refused by the Premier League.

It is understood that QPR had made it clear earlier this week they wanted to send Zarate back to West Ham and negotiate another loan deal, with Jarvis and Carlton Cole the options. 

The Premier League strugglers are now stuck with Zarate, who has made just one substitute appearance since joining the club on a temporary deal at the start of January.
