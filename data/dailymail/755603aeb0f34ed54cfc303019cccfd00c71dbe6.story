Charlotte Church's father was left with a bloody, swollen face and black eyes after allegedly asking for cocaine at a New Year's Eve party.

James Church, 47, suffered a fractured eye socket after the attack at a Cardiff snooker club in the early hours of January 1 this year.

The man accused of hitting Mr Church was today cleared of two counts of grievous bodily harm after claiming he acted in self-defence.

James Church, the father of singer Charlotte Church, suffered a fractured eye socket and black eyes during a New Year's Eve fight in a Cardiff snooker hall

Mr Church is the stepfather of singer Charlotte Church, whose mother Maria was also at the New Year's Eve party

Robert Moore, 46, said Mr Church's injuries could have been caused by a toilet door.

He described Mr Church, a businessman, as someone who 'thinks he walks on water - he thinks he's God's gift for some reason.'

Moore, who is unemployed, claimed he saw Mr Church using cocaine at the party and said he was asked by Mr Church if people were 'doing' the drug.

Later, the men bumped into each other in the snooker club's toilets where violence ensued.

Prosecutor Jeremy Jenkins said: 'Moore struck Mr Church on the head with a bottle causing him to fall to the floor.

'While on the floor he was kicked in the right eye and then continuously kicked in the face and stamped on.

'Photographs showed footmarks to the forehead.

'It was a sustained and unprovoked attack resulting in serious injuries.'

Charlotte's mother Maria screamed in horror and went hysterical when she saw her battered husband minutes after the fight, the court heard.

Mrs Church, 47, told the jury: 'I had never seen such a smashed-up face. He was an absolute, complete and utter mess and badly injured.

'When I saw his face I absolutely screamed - I went hysterical. I've never experienced anything like that before.

'I shouted: "What's happened?" and he told me he'd been punched, stamped on and kicked.'

The incident happened at the Potters Bar Pool Hall, now known as the Canton Sports Club, in Leckwith, Cardiff.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that five months earlier Moore had shouted threats at Mr Church based on the fact that he was Charlotte's father.

But at the New Year's Eve party Moore said there would not be any trouble and the pair shook hands.

Moore told the court: 'He came in confrontationally asking for cocaine and I said we didn't do cocaine.

'He came towards me to "do" me and I got in first. We both fell over and I fell on top of him and we were both chucking punches.'

Mr Jenkins told the court that Moore's claim that Mr Church has asked about a cocaine was a 'gratuitous lie to blacken his character.'

Moore replied: 'That's total nonsense. I didn't attack him. He attacked me.'

Mr Church, a businessman, adopted Charlotte in 1999 after marrying her mother Maria. The family is pictured in November 2000

The court heard that Mr Church was treated in hospital and it was seven weeks before his injuries healed up.

Moore, from Grangetown, Cardiff, gave a clenched fist salute to family and friends when the verdict was announced and thanked the jury.

Charlotte, 26, who was adopted by Mr Church in 1999, was not in court to support her parents.
