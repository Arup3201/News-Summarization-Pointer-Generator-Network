A Major League Baseball player pitched in to help subdue an unruly passenger on an overnight flight to Chile.

New York Mets right-hander LaTroy Hawkins revealed on his Instagram page that he assisted an American Airlines flight attendant who ended up wrestling with a passenger who was unhappy with his seat.

The trouble erupted on flight 945 from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Santiago on Sunday.

The passenger was so disruptive that the plane made an unscheduled stop in Lima, Peru, where he was ejected and handed over to local police.

In a text message to The New York Daily News, Mr Hawkins wrote: ‘We had to subdue a guy who was upset about not being able to sit in an open seat in business class. He and flight attendant started wrestling and fell into my lap. The (flight attendant) said he needed help.’

Mr Hawkins, whose 6ft 5in frame would have been a welcome sight for the attendant, wrote on Instagram: ‘These 2 studs had to subdue a guy on our flight from DFW to Santiago Chile. Escorted him off the plane after we made an emergency landing in Peru. Long nite with a crazy passenger…’

An American Airlines spokesman confirmed that flight 945 made an unscheduled stop because of the troublesome customer.

He told ESPN: ‘They were noncompliant, unruly, which happens on occasion. And when it does, sometimes we'll divert a flight. For the safety of everybody on board, it's much easier just to get that individual off the plane. And that's what we did and turned it over to local law enforcement, and then the flight continued on.’

Mr Hawkins was travelling to Chile with friends Rodney Carter and Leonard Whittenberg to go dove hunting, according to ESPN.
