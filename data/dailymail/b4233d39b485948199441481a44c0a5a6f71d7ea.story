Arsene Wenger has no regrets about allowing the opportunity to bring Cesc Fabregas back to Arsenal pass him by last summer.

The Gunners had first option on signing the 27-year-old midfielder after they inserted a clause in the deal which took him to Barcelona in 2011.

But Wenger decided against making a move the Spaniard during the last transfer window and he subsequently joined Chelsea for £30million.

Fabregas has been in sensational form since his move to Stamford Bridge, laying on seven assists for his team-mates in seven Premier League appearances.

But despite the Spain international's dazzling performances in blue, Wenger insists he is content with his decision not to offer him a return to the Emirates. 

Speaking to BeIN sports, he said: 'I don't regret not taking Cesc because we already had a lot of creative players in our midfield.'

Arsenal lost 2-0 to league leaders Chelsea in their last fixture before the international break, a result which left them nine points behind Jose Mourinho's side.

But even with a hefty gap already between the two sides, the Frenchman is confident his side will catch their London rivals as the season goes on.

He added: 'Chelsea will also have a difficult period [in the season]. Our schedule was extremely difficult and I have the belief that we can close the gap to them.'
