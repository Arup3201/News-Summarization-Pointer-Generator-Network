Surveillance video showing a Dallas police officer shooting a mentally ill man as he stood still about 20ft away contradicts the assertion of an officer that the man threatened his safety by lunging at him with a knife.

Bobby Gerald Bennett remains in hospital after being shot in the stomach on Monday. The officer who shot him, Cardan Spencer, is on indefinite administrative leave pending a criminal investigation after a neighbor released surveillance video that captured the incident.

Bennett was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Police Chief David Brown announced on Friday that the charge would be dropped.

Mr Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, said in an interview yesterday that her 52-year-old son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that he was off his medication at the time of the shooting. 

Ms Jackson said she was arguing with 
Bennett when she called the police. She was told that officers who have 
been trained in dealing with the mentally ill would arrive to assist 
her.

The officers arrived outside her 
southeast Dallas home at about noon to find Mr Bennett sitting on a 
chair in the street holding a knife. At this point, accounts of the 
incident differ.

Officer Spencer wrote in a police report that Mr Bennett refused to drop the knife and moved towards him and another officer 'in a threatening manner'.

He said that was when he fired at Mr Bennett four times from about 20ft away, wounding him.

The
video tells a different story. Although the police report says Mr 
Bennett 'lunged' at the officers with a knife, in the video he stands up
from the chair but then doesn't appear to move at all until the gun is 
fired and he crumples to the ground.

The
surveillance video doesn't include audio, and Officer Spencer wrote in 
his report that Mr Bennett yelled at them, 'You all are gonna need more 
officers than this!'

But it doesn't show that the incident 
'escalated, which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the 
individual', as police spokesman Warren Mitchell said in a statement a 
few hours after the shooting.

Police Chief David Brown said in a statement on Thursday night that Officer Spencer has been placed on indefinite administrative leave pending a 'thorough criminal investigation'.

Ms Jackson said she and her son had been arguing about whether he could take an ink drawing of a rose he had done for his late grandmother. The drawing is framed on the wall of her home.

The argument soon escalated to the point where Ms Jackson felt she needed police assistance.

'I'm devastated that I felt the need to call 911,' she said.

Ms Jackson said her son struggled 
with mental illness and often left her home to sleep on the streets, but
said he is an avid artist and reader and isn't violent.

According to state criminal records, he was convicted of larceny, 
vehicle theft and forgery in the 1980s but has no recent arrests.

'I was expecting help from someone that's a lot more knowledgeable than me,' she said.

Mr
Mitchell, the police spokesman, declined to say whether the two 
officers sent to Ms Jackson's home had any specific mental health 
training.

Ms Jackson, who 
was inside her home when she heard four gunshots, said it was a 
'miracle' that her neighbor's camera recorded the incident. Otherwise, 
'I wouldn't have had a leg to stand on,' she said.

Maurice Bunch installed the surveillance camera two years ago after a trailer was stolen from his driveway.

'The videotape just cries out for an independent investigation,' Bill Wirskye, a former high-ranking Dallas County prosecutor, told Dallas News.

'Maybe there’s something that’s not in the video that would justify the officer’s actions, but at least based on the videotape and the documentation that I’ve seen, it’s not a justified shooting.'

Because of the charge against him, Ms Jackson had been prevented from seeing her son, who has been in intensive care since Monday.

An order from a judge reversed that decision on Friday. 'When I knew I was going to get up to see him, I was jumping up and down up in the cul-de-sac,' Ms Jackson said.
