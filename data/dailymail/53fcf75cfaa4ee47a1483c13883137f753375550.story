It had been a humdrum press conference, the like of which are common during pre-season, when suddenly a topic arose to make Brendan Rodgers bristle.

‘How will Liverpool cope without Luis Suarez?’ came the question from the floor.

Rodgers, whose side had just beaten Olympiacos 1-0 on Sunday night in Chicago, fixed an icy glare on his inquisitor.

Nothing riles him more than the inference Liverpool were a one-man band last season and nothing will give him greater satisfaction than to retain his team’s vibrancy and potency without the forward who has departed for Barcelona.VIDEO Scroll down to see Markovic eyes Premier League trophy

‘What do I see when I look at the team?’ said Rodgers (right). ‘I see players who scored 70 goals last season. It’s fairly simple. Luis Suarez is not a Liverpool player any more, so we don’t need to talk about him. When we didn’t have Luis, we scored goals. That won’t be an issue.’

So how will he do it? The first true glimpse of what Liverpool will be like without Suarez arrived in Chicago and will be seen again tomorrow night here in New York, when they lock horns with Manchester City in the Guinness International Champions Cup tournament.

Speed is what Rodgers feels Liverpool need; jet-heeled wingers like Lazar Markovic and Raheem Sterling, swapping and interchanging from the flanks, charging at defenders and creating chances for Daniel Sturridge.

Rodgers deployed a 4-1-2-3 formation in Chicago, different to last year’s 4-1-3-2 model, with Jordan Henderson and another new boy, Emre Can, positioned just ahead of Steven Gerrard. The aim will be for Liverpool to swarm all over their opponents, blitzing  them with devastating counter-attacks.

‘You look at young Markovic and Raheem, the pace of Daniel,’ Rodgers continued. ‘We have great variety in our attack, full of pace and trickery.

‘We have got people, like Markovic, who can beat defenders. I hope it will be another stand-out season for quality and entertainment.’

Sterling scored the only goal against Olympiacos but Markovic, a £20million signing from Benfica, caught the eye on his debut — one direct surge, memorably, tied two defenders up in knots — and he built on the impression he had made during training at Harvard University in Boston.

Already a Serbia international, the 20-year-old is regarded as one of the most promising young players in Europe. Rodgers has been raving about him since he arrived on  Merseyside and with reason: consider these views, for instance, from Rui Costa,  Benfica’s sporting director.

‘Markovic likes to take risks and attack,’ Costa explained. ‘He is very cold blooded when he’s in a one-to-one situation and he’s not afraid of facing the opponents. He’s eager to learn, so I think he will adapt quickly. He is a pure talent.’

If it clicks as Rodgers envisages, the amount of chances Liverpool create will not dwindle. Should that be the case Sturridge, whose role in the team is even more crucial in the post-Suarez era, will be the man to profit.

Defiant: Rodgers is certain that his team can challenge again this season

Farewell: But the former Liverpool forward will be missed following his move to Barcelona

‘The manager has signed young, exciting players, up-and-comers as they call them,’ said Sturridge. ‘We are going to have a winning mentality and the ambition to move forward. We will be an exciting squad that plays attacking football. That’s the Liverpool way.

‘We are a young squad looking to put our stamp down in the Premier League and Europe as well.

'We will try to move  forward as a squad with a great manager behind us who has the exact same mentality. He is hungry for success. We all are.’

If this is a big season for Liverpool, as they strive to show that charge for the title was not a flash in the pan, the same can be said of Sturridge. Can he reproduce the 21 league goals he scored last time?

‘This is a huge club with a lot of players who can step up,’ Sturridge replied. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s by default that I’m the main man. Luis has left and that is football, he’s moved on but he’s doing it for himself and his family. As a team we will move forward, I wouldn’t say I’m the main man. We are going to do our best to move forward.’
