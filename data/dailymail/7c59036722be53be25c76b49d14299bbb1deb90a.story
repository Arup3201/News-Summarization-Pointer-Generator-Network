The Crufts ‘Good Citizen’ award is reserved for the most obedient and well-trained dog – so you would expect only the best of behaviour from the winner.

But last year’s victor Eddie – a brown and snow-white Akita – disgraced the title just hours after claiming it.

As the award winner was posing with his proud owner for photographs he suddenly lunged at a nearby woman, sinking his teeth into her knee and hand.

Attack dog: Eddie the Akita, left, had just passed an award at a Crufts show in Birmingham when he suddenly lunged at Louise Nelson, right, leaving her needing surgery on her knee and with permanent nerve damage

Former accountant Louise Nelson was left needing surgery on her knee and with permanent nerve damage to her hand.

A
 district judge at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court found Eddie’s owner 
Lorain Ronis, 52, guilty of allowing a dog to be dangerously out of 
control in a public place.

Mrs
 Ronis, a dog trainer  and dog walker, claims witnesses exaggerated the 
attack because they were fierce rivals on the  dog circuit and wanted 
her out  of the way.

The 
court heard she was posing with her five-year-old dog for a celebratory 
picture after he triumphed in the Good Citizen Dog category. But Eddie 
took a dislike to a nearby Akita called Banks and sprang forward.

Convicted: Lorain Ronis (above), 52, was found guilty of letting Eddie be dangerously out of control in public

After being pulled away by his owner he lunged a second time, clamping Miss Nelson’s kneecap in his jaws.

She
 told the court she feared her kneecap would be ripped off during the 
six-second attack on March 8 last year during the Crufts show at 
Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre.

Miss
 Nelson, 33, an experienced dog owner who has been attending shows for 
13 years, said: ‘I tried to get out of the way but it grabbed hold of my
 knee and was shaking my kneecap.’

As
 she attempted to free herself she also received a bite to the hand. 
Witness June Watson said she saw Mrs Ronis and Eddie standing ‘too 
close’ to the other Akita.

She said: ‘There was a little bit of contact 
[between the dogs] and then they were separated.

‘The lady on the bench [Miss Nelson] stood up and it [Eddie] went towards her and grabbed her leg.’

Denying
 the offence Mrs Ronis, from Luton, said her dog had never been 
aggressive and claimed the other Akita had attacked first.

She said: ‘Eddie was never dangerous or out of control. She suffered her injury by getting between two dogs.’

Mrs Ronis claims that Miss Nelson had told her at the time ‘dogs will be dogs, don’t worry about it’.

‘If I had known then how this was going to unravel I would have got more witnesses,’ she said.

During
 the trial it was revealed Miss Nelson, from County Durham, had been 
sacked from her accountant’s job after stealing £10,000 from her 
employer and had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of fraud by abuse of 
position.

She was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 12 months.

Mrs
 Ronis claimed Miss Nelson’s need for money to repay her employer was 
behind the allegation. She also claimed  that the other witnesses were 
fierce rivals on the dog show  circuit. ‘They are my competitors, they 
don’t like me,’ she  told the court.

Convicting
 Mrs Ronis of the offence, district judge Ian Strongman said he found 
Eddie had caused the injuries to Miss Nelson, but made no order to have 
the dog destroyed.

He said:
 ‘I’m satisfied when the dog started misbehaving Mrs Ronis tried her 
best to pull it back.’ He adjourned the case for sentence until August 
14.
