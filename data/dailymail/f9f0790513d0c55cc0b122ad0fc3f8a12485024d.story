Thanksgiving was truly a family affair for Stefan Holt, the Chicago news anchor and son of NBC Weekend anchor Lester.

When his famed father spent the holiday with 25-year-old Stefan and his wife in the Windy City, the veteran newsman volunteered to help out on Black Friday if one of his son's co-workers wanted the day off.

Lester, 53, is one of the biggest names on NBC's roster and before working in the Today and Nightly News studios in New York, he spent more than a decade at a local news station in Chicago.

On-air family time: Lester Holt joined his son Stefan as he anchored the news in Chicago on Black Friday

His son Stefan followed in his footsteps, and joined the NBC family last summer.

The two appeared together as co-anchors on Friday's noon broadcast for NBC 5, effectively reversing the tradition and making it a form of 'take your father to work day'.

'To say I had to pinch myself is an understatement,' the elder Holt wrote in a post for Today.com.

'The father in me was bursting with pride, while the seasoned broadcaster in me was trying to remain focused on making sure it was a solid broadcast.'

Face time: Lester said that Stefan has always had a passion for news

Seeing the opportunity for a feel-good segment, the duo called in for an interview by Lester's co-workers at the Today Show where they showed pictures of a young Stefan visiting his father in the newsroom, back in the day when Lester was starting out and sporting a moustache.

'Stef and I really enjoy each other, we have a good time, but at the heart of it, he's really a serious news man- I say that incredulously- he really has a passion for news and it's fun. We always kind of shared that with me,' the proud dad said.

Blackmail: Lester joked that if he felt threatened by Stefan, he would release a video he took of his son doing a Gangnam style dance in the kitchen over Thanksgiving

'I'm a little nervous because he's actually really good.'

He secured a form of insurance, however, as he joked that he took an embarrassing video of Stefan dancing in the kitchen during their Thanksgiving feast.

'If he were going to try to make a move on the old man, I've got blackmail!' Lester threatened.
