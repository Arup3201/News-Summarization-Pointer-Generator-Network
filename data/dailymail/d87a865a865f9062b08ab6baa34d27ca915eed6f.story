The washboard stomach of Jessica Ennis, the curvaceous figure of Beyonce, the glossy hair of Katherine Jenkins and the sparkling eyes of Nicole Scherzinger.

These are the physical attributes that would make up the ideal woman, according to a new survey of men and women.

Interestingly, one lesser-discussed female body part - seldom held in such unanimously high regard - also made the list: Samantha Cameron's strong, straight nose.

The washboard stomach of Jessica Ennis, the curvaceous figure of Beyonce, the glossy hair of Katherine Jenkins, the sparkling eyes of Nicole Scherzinger and Samantha Cameron's nose are the physical attributes that make up the ideal woman

Meanwhile, the ideal man would have the taut body of either David Beckham or Jenson Button, the crooked grin of Ryan Gosling's smile, Brad Pitt's jawline and the shimmering eyes of Daniel 'James Bond' Craig.

The survey, commissioned by Morrisons, asked 1,000 men and 1,000 women which body parts they most admired on celebrities.

The survey also revealed many shoppers are focused on improving their own bodies, with 46 per cent claiming they are currently working on improving their own health and fitness

One in five respondents claimed they were not currently happy with their body shape, and 61 per cent said starting a healthy eating regime would give an instant boost.

The surprise vote went to Samantha Cameron, who was voted as having the most perfect celebrity nose

Almost a third (27 per cent) said avoiding chocolate makes them feel more confident about their figures, and 30 per cent said visiting the gym for a workout.

And a deep-pocketed 13 per cent said a shopping trip had the same effect.

Nutritionist for Morrisons NuMe healthy eating range Bryonie Holleart said: 'While we all want to look like a celebrity, we know getting that perfect body requires hard work - both in the gym and in the kitchen.

'It's clear too that many people will give up their best intentions, often because it's hard to keep cooking healthy meals, maintain an expensive diet plan, all while putting in hours in on the treadmill.'

The ideal man, meanwhile, would comprise Ryan Gosling's slightly wonky smile, right, and former footballer David Beckham's well-trained body
