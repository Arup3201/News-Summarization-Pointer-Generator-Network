Fitting road to go down: Poland wants to name a roundabout in Warsaw after Baroness Thatcher because there's no need for U-turns, a reference to her reluctance to perform a political volte-face during her time as Prime Minister

It is, in hindsight, the natural tribute.

A council in Poland is trying to re-name one of its roundabouts after Baroness Thatcher as U-turns are impossible.

City officials in Warsaw have made the proposal.

Local councillor Wojciech Bartelski told local media it would be 'the perfect way' to remember Lady Thatcher’s role in aiding the collapse of Communism in eastern Europe.

One of his colleagues claimed: ‘A roundabout is the perfect way to represent Mrs Thatcher. It makes u-turns unnecessary.’

Lady Thatcher coined the phrase 'the lady's not for the turning' in a speech to the Conservative Party Conference in October 1980 to symbolise her refusal to perform a U-turn on her tough economic reforms which earned her the nickname the Iron Lady.

In it, she said: 'To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the 'U-turn', I have only one thing to say: "You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning".

'I say that not only to you, but to our friends overseas and also to those who are not our friends.'

Poland is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the former Prime Minister, who died earlier this month aged 87.

There have also been proposals from politicians in the country to build a statue in her honour.

She is well-liked for her role in helping end the Cold War in Eastern Europe.

However, the plan may face opposition from political foes in Poland.

Some left-wingers in Warsaw claim the roundabout should be named after Edward Gierek, a former Polish communist party first secretary from the 1970s.
