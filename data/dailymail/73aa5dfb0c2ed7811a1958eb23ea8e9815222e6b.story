New Year's Eve celebrations across the country brought out not just large crowds of revelers this year, but also many protesting the recent wave of police killings.

In New York City, hundreds gathered in Union Square to march to Times Square as Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family led the annual ball drop.

This as protesters in Boston staged a die-in during the city's popular First Night celebration.

According to CBS News, 'Dozens of people briefly lay down in the plaza in front of the Boston Public Library on Wednesday evening while others held signs saying "black lives matter" and "a young black man is two times more likely to be shot dead by police than a young white man."'

Cops in New York City prepared for the night's protest by passing out flyers that informed individuals that they are 'not permitted to walk in the roadway or streets.'

Furthermore, it stated that 'sufficient sidewalk space' must be left by any groups walking together, in order to accommodate other pedestrians.

Protesters wore shirts that said 'Don't Shoot I'm Black' and carried signs saying 'Black Lives Matter' as police stood close by with plastic cuffs ready.

The group  walked from Union Square up to Times Square, but was ultimately stopped at 38th and Broadway by the previously set up perimeter for the evening.

New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton was spotted by the ball earlier today with the thousands of officers charged with keeping the peace as a million visitors are expected in Times Square this year. 

Governor Andrew Cuomo today announced the New York Army and Air National Guard will have an increased presence during this New Year's Eve, conducting extra security missions throughout New York City.

There were also protests earlier in the day in St. Louis, with nearly 100 people storming the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters.
