Marine life in the Great Barrier Reef could be under threat if new plans to transfer coal between ships in the middle of the ocean go ahead.

This process has never been undertaken in Australia, and environmentalists have concerns that ships could crash into each other spewing coal into the world heritage-listed waters.

They also say activity could disturb sensitive eco-systems and upset fisheries and turtles.

Mitchell Ports is the company which has applied to the federal Department of Environment, and are aiming to get permission to send barges into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

Their subsidiary company, Hay Port Exports, have plans to expand their already existing terminal at Hay Point, south of Mackay in central Queensland.

They have lodged an application to construct a new barging and trans-shipping terminal at the location, equipped to handle up to 15 million tonnes of coal per year.

Instead of docking at a land-based port, ships would anchor offshore, above a sand bed, as cranes on a barge transfers coal from a smaller ship to a larger vessel.

However Hay Port Exports has admitted in its Bowen Basin Terminal plan could affect endangered migratory species such as the irrawaddy and indo pacific humpback dolphins.

'Although it is likely to be minimal, the project could impact on listed, threatened and migratory species,' it said in its application.

The Australian Marine Conservation society have great concerns for the transfer of coal between ships, as any accident could pose a threat to sea life.

'We could see boats crash into each other. We could see coal spewing into reef waters,' campaigner Felicity Wishart told AAP, adding light pollution and noise could affect spawning fisheries and turtles.

'We don't think a marine park is a place where you should be dredging, dumping or transferring coal from ship to ship.

'Mitchell Ports, however, argues its trans-shipping proposal minimised the need for sea bed dredging, which occurs when a land-based port is expanded.'

Executive director of Mitchell Ports Ben King, who is heading up the Hay Port project agreed the proposal presented some risks, but said they would use European technology.

Environmentalists are against the move saying any accidents could seriously upset sensitive eco-systems in the reef

'There's always the potential for accidents and we have to make sure that ... our engineering comes up with a suitable risk profile where we have safeguards,' he told AAP.

He added this type of trans-shipping was carried out in Italy and the Netherlands.

Mitchell Ports has put forward a controversial proposal like this before - the Fitzroy Terminal near Rockhampton in central Queensland.

The Fitzroy Terminal is also an expansion of a current port, Port Alma, claiming to export more than 25 million tonnes of coal per year.
