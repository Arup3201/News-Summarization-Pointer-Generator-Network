All Britons living in Scotland will automatically become 'Scottish citizens', even if they were born in England, Wales or Northern Ireland under Alex Salmond's plans for independence.

Anyone classed as 'habitually resident' will become eligible for a Scottish passport, along with all Scots living around the world.

Mr Salmond insists there will be no need for border controls with England, but Labour's Ed Miliband has signalled border guards and passport checks would have to be considered to control immigration.

UK passport holders living in Scotland would 'automatically' become Scottish citizens but will not have to take a Scottish passport under Alex Salmond's plans for independence

People with UK passports will not be forced to switch to a Scottish alternative if voters back indepdence in the historic referendum on Thursday.

But it would be up to the UK government to decide if someone can have dual citizenship between Britain and Scotland.

Britons living in Scotland and Scots living anyehwere in the world 'will automatically be considered Scottish citizens', under Mr Salmond's plans.

This will include British citizens who hold dual citizenship with another country. Other people will be able to register or apply for Scottish citizenship on independence based on 'clear criteria'.

All Scottish citizens will have the right to acquire a Scottish passport, although there will be no requirement to hold one.

Mr Salmond also hopes for an independent Scotland to join Common Travel Area (CTA) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

The official white paper for independence states: 'We plan to remain part of the CTA which means that there will be no border controls, and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.'

However, Mr Salmond also wants to have a more relaxed immigration policy than that adopted by Westminster, raising the prospect of Scotland being used as a back door route into the UK.

The SNP plans to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry to Scotland, and to reintroduce a 'post-study work visa'.

It means it would effectively have a more open immigration policy than the rest of the UK, requiring controls at the border.

The changes would take effect from 24 March 2016 when Scotland would formally become an independent country.

At the weekend Mr Miliband said the only way to maintain an open border was to reject independence.

'If you don't want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom,' the Labour leader said in an interview with today's Scottish Mail on Sunday.

Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: 'It would have to be looked at.'

And Mr Miliband's spokesman added last night: 'The last time I looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.'

A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'Existing UK passports can continue to be used as normal until they expire. People will travel freely over the border between Scotland and England just as they travel freely from Northern Ireland to Ireland. 

'Scotland will negotiate its ongoing membership of the EU in the 18 months between the referendum and Independence Day in March 2016 - as Professor Charlie Jeffrey has pointed out: "The overwhelming body of expert opinion is that Scotland's EU membership will be uninterrupted." 

'So no queuing at airports will be necessary.'

Earlier this year Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael accused the SNP of having 'two fundamentally contradictory propositions'.

'First of all they say we can be part of the CTA, which [would be] an open border between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, and at the same time they say they will have a widely divergent immigration policy.

'You can have either of these things, but you cannot have them both. My challenge to the Scottish Government is to explain which of these it is going to be.'

Mr Carmichael said the SNP's immigration proposals are 'radically different' and would be 'incompatible' with the CTA.

It means travellers heading south could be forced to pull over and undergo lengthy Calais-style identity checks on 21 roads that cross the border, including the A1, A68 and M74.

Rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train leaving from Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen for England, in a similar time-consuming regime to Eurostar journeys from France.

A UK Government analysis paper, launched in January, also revealed that lorries and vans could be inspected at the English border if Scotland becomes independent amid fears of alcohol and tobacco smuggling.
