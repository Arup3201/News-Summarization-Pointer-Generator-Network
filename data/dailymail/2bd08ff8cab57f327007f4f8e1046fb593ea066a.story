Everton have vowed to work with the French police to try to understand why trouble flared in Lille ahead of the Europa League tie. 

The club say there were two 'serious but isolated' incidents in France before the match. One Everton fan was taken to hospital with a heavy bloodied gash above his left eye, after being hit by a CS Gas Canister fired by police, who also reportedly used pepper spray.

Some Toffees supporters were also attacked on Wednesday night in an 'unprovoked' attack on a bar in Lille.

Two Everton fans were reportedly arrested on Thursday night. A club statement said: 'Everton will continue to work closely with the French and Merseyside police, in conjunction with the club's own security team, to better understand the two isolated but serious incidents that occurred in Lille ahead of our Europa League fixture this week.

'All available reports suggest that the first incident, on the night before the game, was an unprovoked and planned attack by local youths.

'The second incident, early in the afternoon on matchday, in the city's main square, quickly escalated into unwelcome and unpleasant scenes.

'Events then, equally quickly, returned back to normal with well-mannered and good-natured celebrations that were evident throughout the club's stay in Lille.

'The club will now work with all authorities to find out what happened and why.

'In order to gather as much detail as possible on the incidents and on other issues encountered by fans, the club has provided an online feedback form.'

Everton say the trouble started when a plainclothes officers went to arrest a supporter who was misbehaving.

Visiting fans thought it was local Lille follower giving the man hassle and retaliated.

He ran from police and it sparked the confrontation which led to CS gas and pepper spray being used.

The supporter, who was taken off to hospital in an ambulance, had a  bloodied gash above his left eye that came from a a CS Gas canister that was fired by police.

Back in the square, a loud bang rattled through the area as the police let off the first of three tear gas bombs.

With shields covering their bodies, the police move aggressively through a group of Everton fans, knocking one to the ground as the second tear gas bomb was released.

Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Several fans seemed extremely shaken by the events and the majority  felt they had been victims of another unprovoked attack.

One fan shouted, 'they've got rubber bullets', which the police reportedly used to stem any further aggression from either set of fans, although there were no Lille fans in sight.

The away support certainly seemed to be the victims as the mood in the square had been a pleasant one for the majority of the afternoon.
