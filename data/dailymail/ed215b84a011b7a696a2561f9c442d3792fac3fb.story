Fulham have sacked boss Felix Magath following their poor start to the season and appointed Kit Symons as caretaker manager. 

The German had come under increasing scrutiny after a dismal start to the season that has left the Cottagers bottom of the Championship table with only one point from their opening seven games.

Following a conference call held at the club on Thursday, which included US based owner Shahid Khan, a statement from the club said:

Fulham Chairman Shahid Khan has named Kit Symons as Caretaker Manager of Fulham Football Club and will personally and immediately lead a thorough search for the new First Team Manager of the Club.

Symons, the Under 21 Manager at Fulham, replaces Felix Magath. Mr. Khan thanked Magath for his efforts through the final three months of last season in the Barclays Premier League and the first seven matches this season in the Sky Bet Championship.

'This is an unfortunate but necessary change,' Khan said. 

'I am doing what I feel is right and needed for Fulham Football Club, for today as well as tomorrow. I thank our supporters for standing by us during these most difficult of times on the pitch, and promise better days ahead.' 

Khan was very reluctant to fire another manager, aware of his growing reputation for impatience spreading across the game after Fulham’s problems last season but felt it was important that a swift change was made.

The American has now sacked three managers - Martin Jol,  Rene Meulensteen and Magath - since taking over the club in July 2013.

For him, the bottom line was dismal results, a worrying trend of being unable to hang onto leads and a growing number of heavy defeats.

All this after he backed Magath in the transfer market and bought the players he demanded.

The rapid turnover of managers has however become part of the problem at the club, with the different players identified by different managers and subsequently unwanted. 

Fulham will be determined to make the right appointment for their highly-rated academy and a manager they think can plot a return to the Barclays Premier League while developing some of the exciting talent produced through the youth ranks.

At the same time, apart from being the hottest seat in London at the moment, the job will appeal to many managers. Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon is among the early favourites.

It is well located in the capital with a top-grade training base, successful youth department and it is financially stable, with a billionaire owner, even if previous managers will not recommend the post in terms of job security.
