A relieved mother has described how a parent’s group on Facebook helped save her toddler's life after her serious illness was undetected by doctors and resulted in emergency surgery.

First-time mother Kerry , 37, turned to her local Inner West Mum’s support group in Sydney on the social media site after her 21-month-old daughter Gracie’s ear began drastically swelling.

She posted a photo of a red lump on her daughter’s head on the Facebook group and was immediately inundated by advice and support from fellow mums.

Just in time: 21-month-old Gracie received surgery to release the pressure that had built up in her skull just in time

They urged Kerry to rush to the hospital straight away and one even correctly diagnosed Gracie with mastoiditis, an infection that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. If left untreated it can spread to the brain, causing serious complications.

'The main one that stuck in my head was from a lady called Emily. She put a picture up of her daughter with the exact same condition,' Kerry told Daily Mail Australia.

The woman also told Kerry her daughter was in hospital for ten days. Doctors have now confirmed what Gracie had was a severe case of mastoiditis.

Her daughter had an abbess and during emergency surgery they drilled into her skull to release the pressure before it spread.

'You can't imagine it was horrendous,' Kerry said of her terrifying night in hospital.

Worrying: The swelling behind Gracie's ear concerned her mother Kerry so she posted this photo on Facebook

Terrified: The first-time mum said she trusted her mother's instinct and rushed her daughter straight to hospital after receiving warnings on Facebook

Kerry had been concerned for her daughter's health for about eight weeks, since Gracie started day care and suffered a chest infection which she didn’t seem to get over.

She returned to the doctors about two or three times a week with her sick child but began to feel neurotic after she was told it was usual for children to get sick after joining day care.

When Gracie's temperature rocked to above 40 degrees on Saturday 19 July she first rushed her to hospital.

Doctors told Kerry it was a mid-ear infection and prescribed her antibiotics which helped calm the temperature for a short while.

Gracie returned to day care but staff told Kerry she still seemed 'grumpy'.

The next day, while Kerry was bathing her daughter, she noticed a red bump sticking out behind Gracie’s head and took a picture and sent it to her mother.

Inundated: Kerry's update on Facebook received over 600 likes from mothers in the support group

She then posted it on Facebook and had received 60-70 replies within an hour, with many telling her to get her daughter to hospital immediately.

It was 9.30pm by that point and her daughter was in bed when she received the warning. 

Kerry's husband Paul was concerned about taking advice from the internet and waking Gracie up when she was unwell.

But Kerry said she listened to her mother’s instinct and rushed her daughter there as soon she received the advice.

The family waited inside the hospital until 4am and were about to go home when a doctor came to see them.

'Because we’d been in there for five hours, it got to four in the morning and I thought "maybe you are right". We were putting our coats on and were about to leave. We were falling asleep. But luckily we didn’t as I can’t imagine what would have happened if we left,' Kerry said.

The doctor apologised and said Gracie needed surgery immediately to relieve the swelling before it reached her brain.

A CT scan followed and they were in theatre within hours, where doctors drilled into Gracie’s skull to receive pressure from the swelling.

Kerry waited anxiously for three hours while her daughter was in surgery.

'We hadn’t slept and seeing this vulnerable little person - she is your life – and you see her wheeled off on a trolley.

'You are frantic basically,' Kerry said.

'At one point during the CT scan they rang me to say it was mastoiditis and when they operate it may affect her facial nerves and her hearing. They have to tell you that but it’s so scary,’ Kerry added.Doctors have now told Kerry she did the right thing and was just in time.

Support: Worried mothers were relieved to hear Gracie is OK

'She is my life': Kerry said the couldn't sleep after seeing their daughter 'wheeled off on a trolley'

Relieved: Kerry said she didn't realise how important Facebook was at the time

After getting out of surgery on Wednesday, Kerry thanked all the ‘wonderful mummies’ on Facebook who advised her.

'Just wanted to give a great big shout out to all you wonderful mummies that advised me/encourage me last night. It’s been an horrendous 24 hours, but my daughter had surgery today and thank The Lord I went in when I did, as the surgeon said any longer about would have been much more serious. She is doing well and I can’t wait I get her well again! You are such a wonderful group!,' she wrote. 

Kerry received over 600 likes from relieved mothers and was also sent gifts by two mums who had heard about the story, including one woman who was on her hospital ward.

Kerry and Gracie are now back at home and the toddler is already 'giggling again'.

'She's fine, we came home yesterday she’s got a lovely scar but luckily it will be hidden by her hair.

'She's giggling again and happy and I guess now on reflection I know now she hasn't been herself lately.

'She's back to normal. At the time I didn't realise how important it was I to put it on Facebook.'
