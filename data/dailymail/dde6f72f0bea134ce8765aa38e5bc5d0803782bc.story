A one-year-old boy has died after a pick-up truck thought to belong to one of his relatives reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on top of him. 

The baby, believed to be from an Asian family, suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham.

Several neighbours have said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash.

An air ambulance landed in a public park opposite the house and paramedics made desperate efforts to save the baby after the 'tragic' crash earlier today.

Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident in Birmingham where a one-year-old boy died after a pick-up truck -thought to belong to his father - reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on him

Police were alerted  at around 5pm and officers said the road was likely to be closed for some time for an investigation to take place.

The family's next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, said: 'The pick up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the home owner.

'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed.

'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams.

'There was blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.'

One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I don't know how he managed to do it or whether the lad was in a pushchair or cot,' she said. 

A white forensic tent was erected outside the £120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place

Several neighbours said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. Dozens of flowers were left at the scene outside the home today

'But I'm certain he must have been on the footpath the other side of their garden wall. I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.' 

A white forensic tent was erected outside the £120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place and a large number of people could be inside one of the nearby homes. 

Neighbour Barbara Porter, 76, said: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere.

'Its a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heartbreaking.

'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame.

'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.'

Another neighbour Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring.

'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved.

'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy.

Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save the baby and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene 

Officers were called to the Stechford area of the city at around 5pm today following a report that a recovery truck had hit a wall, pictured is the road where the incident took place

'I'm a grandmother and when you think it could have been one of your grandkids, you just can't imagine what the parents must be feeling.' 

Inspector Paul Bennett said: 'This is a very tragic set of circumstances – words cannot describe what his family are going through and our thoughts are with them at this time.

'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and – as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.'

Dozens of people  have already taken to social media to send messages of support to the baby's family, who are believed to be from the area. 

Louise Pernell said: 'How terribly sad...thoughts go out to the family and those that attended the accident ...RIP little one.'

Brad Wilkinson said: 'Tragic, thoughts are with the family.' 

Ben Weatherstone said: 'Just down the road from me... Horrible news.'   

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'A rapid response vehicle was on scene within four minutes of the call and was backed up by an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a BASICS Emergency Doctor and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance.

'The boy suffered a serious head injury.

'Ambulance staff carried out advanced life support but sadly nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene by the doctor.' 

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward, 

Anyone with information about what happened should call police on 101 and ask for the Collision Investigation Unit quoting log 1637 16/3/2015.
